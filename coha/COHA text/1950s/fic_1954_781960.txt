 | greeted them glaringly , and he could only suppose that if there were nothing the matter with the car Grace must have been momentarily blinded , for she had not been driving especially fast . This touch had been the last offering of his foresight , for he had even anticipated that they could calculate from where the car had landed that it had not been traveling at any great rate of speed . As far as he knew , no one had ever thought to question the accident , and as no one had had the slightest reason to believe that his and Grace 's marriage had not been one of the happiest , he had only had to lie hack gloating secretly and accept the sympathy that flowed in upon him in tiresome abundance . The Cameron wedding , because it had merely been the means to an end , had quite slipped from his mind . Doubtless people had sensitively refrained from mentioning it in his presence . But now lie was glad to be reminded of it , because it provided a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reception could have been picture-taking out on the hill opposite Prospect Drive . . . . Wally enthusiastically bid up to a game that probably was n't there , and Martin prepared to lay down a dummy that would almost certainly be found wanting . Gerald Marshall came bounding down the stairs with an unnecessary exhibition of youthful muscular tone . " Good , good ! " cried Dr. Finletter . " You can take my place as soon as this rubber is over . I have to go anyway . It should n't be more than a moment . " In nervous haste he threw out a card at random . Alec Frobisher winced at the sight of it . Somewhat more hopeful , Martin spread out his hand . Then , for lack of other employment , he considered Gerald Marshall as a possible suspect .  | First of all , had Gerald been at the Cameron reception ? Yes , he undoubtedly had , and for an instant Martin thought of striking him out . But then memory came back to him : Gerald had been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had something he wanted to do , and when Dr. Finletter had left after making his courtesy appearance , Gerald had begged a ride with him . That had been a good hour and a half before Grace and Martin had left  --  and the " something " which Gerald had wanted to do might easily have been a matter of photography before the light faded ; he had n't specified . As for Gerald 's financial position . . . Penniless in his own right , Gerald had married , at twentysix , Barbara Chernet  --  whose first husband had inherited and enlarged the Chernet steamship millions . It had been , seemingly , a successful marriage , and for fiften years Gerald had lived high . Then Barbara had died . Naturally the steamship fortune , the income from which had been Barbara 's in her lifetime , had passed to the Chernet children , who had a cordial dislike for their stepfather . Their family pride enabled him to keep up appearances , but their antagonism was such that their generosity stopped dead short when appearances were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blame . A good-hearted soul who hated to refuse anyone anything , yet dutiful to her first husband 's theories of the value of a spartan upbringing , she had dodged the problem of disciplining her children by thoughtlessly blaming any necessary punishments on Gerald . Presumably the consequences of this strategy in the event of her demise had never occurred to her ; and Gerald had been too little interested in the children to notice what was happening , or too shortsighted to protest if he had noticed .  | So once again he had found himself " penniless . " Not , perhaps , in the sense he had been penniless in the days when Barbara had found him life-guarding at East Hampton , for she had been able to leave him an income of two or three thousand a year in his own right . But after a decade and a half of having a fortune at his disposal , this seemed less than the pittance which he had once earned by blowing his whistle at venturesome adolescents . A less sturdy spirit might have crumbled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sly delight in , his downfall . Not Gerald . He had maintained his self-respect by reverting to the natural athleticism which had originally given him the superb physique that had been the undoing of numerous impressionable virgins as well as the more mature Barbara Chernet . Even before he had become a widower his golf game had been one of the best in Alden Park ; since then he had diligently made it the very best . His raisons d'etre had become the Handicap Tourney and the Frobisher Trophy , and the fact that he had won both of these now for three years in succession had given him the satisfied air of a local celebrity . Every morning that was not too inclement he was out on the golf course improving his game ; the afternoons and many evenings he devoted to playing bridge for stakes that would have been far too high if he lost with any regularity . . . . With ingenuous pleasure Wally brought home his undeserved game . The scores were totaled and settled , and Dr. Finletter left in a flurry of smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut for partners took Wally to Alec , and brought Gerald to Martin with the deal . Gerald looked pleased , but Martin assumed that the pleasure was at having avoided Wally rather than at acquiring him . " I feel lucky , " Gerald announced to the table as he leisurely dealt out the cards . " I got a birdie on the seventh hole this  | morning , and whenever I do that I feel lucky . And I think I 've found a new way of tackling the dogleg on the twelfth . If you ? " Once again Martin examined his partner with some curiosity . Gerald had opportunity , motive and temperament to be a blackmailer ; here was the first real suspect Martin had met in the flesh since that dreadful letter had arrived in the morning mail . The man seemed quite as usual  --  but this meant nothing . Whoever was clever enough to have written the letter would be equal to socializing with Martin with unaltered countenance and behavior . No , all that had changed was Martin 's attitude toward Gerald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome the man as a suspect . Martin had never liked Gerald . On the contrary , he had despised him as only the amateur gigolo can despise the professional . Martin 's income ( in his own estimation at least ) placed his marriage to an income three times as large on the dignified footing of a marriage of convenience ; Gerald 's had been that of a common fortune hunter . But previously Martin had been content to dismiss Gerald as a fool . An amiable fool , so that it was possible to suffer him affably , if not gladly ; but a tiresome fool , with his constant enlarging on his adventures on the golf links . Now it was necessary to consider the possibility that underneath the tiresomeness might lie unsuspected reserves of malice and shrewdness . It was by no means inconceivable . . . . a chance of avoiding the sandtraps even if your approach shot is short , " concluded Gerald , rapidly sorting out his hand . " Two spades . See , I said I was feeling lucky ! "  | With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , Martin slammed the car door and climbed the steps to Bill Benson 's front door . For several days he had been racking his brains for some plausible reason for dropping in on Sally Teal , the least familiar of his five suspects , and then Benson had invited him over for the evening and mentioned in passing that Sally , among others , would be there . A fortnight had gone by with no further communication from the blackmailer . Martin had quietly pursued his investigation with much the same scholarly detachment as that which he had formerly brought to the biography of his grandfather , Governor Pryor  --  a work which had recently been suffering from neglect . Grace 's telephone book and his own had yielded a lengthy list of names . He had crossed out all those belonging to people whose financial position seemed to put them above suspicion . This was by no means as easy as it might sound . It was traditional in Alden Park that one kept up the strongest possible front until the petition of bankruptcy was actually filed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extremity was reached without some rumor leaking out .  | Then the remaining names had been checked against the guest list of the Cameron reception . Since the newspaper list was doubtless unreliable , being based on invitations rather than acceptances , this had meant a tedious and very difficult afternoon with Helen Cameron , who had persisted in trying to change the subject tactfully at every opportunity . He had got his way finally , though he had doubtless left behind an impression of brooding morbidity . And then Martin had narrowed the list still further on purely geographic grounds . He had decided that the hill opposite Prospect Drive was not sufficiently elevated , nor did it afford such scenic possibilities , to entice a photographer from any distance . Surely it would occur to no one from the other side of the village to seek out that wholly undistinguished eminence to take pictures from . Martin had obtained a scale map of the township and drawn a circle to include only those houses within a mile of the hill . He had been left with five names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the radical tendencies . Agnes Herndon , Wally 's difficult wife . Bill Benson and Sally Teal . On this list , which now existed solely in his own mind , there were question marks after the last two names . After Benson 's because Martin considered him a close friend , and after Sally Teal 's because she was more or less of an unknown quantity . She was a poor relation of Alec Frobisher 's , a second cousin , or something of the sort . Alec had brought her to Alden Park two or three years ago , and had given her the guest house in the corner of his estate . From report , Martin knew that Sally had turned some part of the house into a studio , and made  | some kind of pottery , doubtless very bad . Grace had early adopted her as a lame dog , had sponsored and befriended her , and had her to all the larger parties at which Martin had always made only the most perfunctory appearances . Rather to his surprise , Benson seemed fond of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , conversational gatherings , which Martin found so much more entertaining than most Alden Park parties . She had been content to stay on the fringe , taking little part in the conversation that flowed around her , so naturally Martin had paid her no more heed than he had at Grace 's functions . But now he had to recognize that her silent presence implied interest or curiosity , and that she had had ample opportunity for observing and reaching judgments about the people , including himself . Martin 's part in the conversation was usually an active one ; from the sidelines Sally would have listened to him , formed an opinion of him , come to understand him . It was very much like being spied upon , and for the first time Martin had found a flaw in his habit of paying as little attention as possible to people who failed to amuse him . However , he was on guard now . He was the watchful one , the hunter . It was not an enjoyable situation at all . It meant that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devote himself to five people , only one of whom he liked . It meant that he had to be constantly self-vigilant , and forever playing a role of naturalness which he could n't feel . And this matter of straining at seeming natural led to excesses  --  such as the burst of unwonted cordiality he unleashed on Eve Benson when she came to let him in . IIe could see she was surprised , but she could n't help responding to the attention , which was natural , since for the rest of the evening she would be relegated to the silent mixing of drinks and serving  | of coffee . Only newcomers incurred Benson 's displeasure by trying to draw his wife into the general conversation , and they quickly learned that she had a nervous fatuousness which could reduce the most stimulating discussion to a shambles of inanity . Martin despised her whole-heartedly , and rarely troubled to conceal it ; now she took a feline revenge by interpreting his amiability as a sign that he had changed since Grace 's death . " We never know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Martin nodded solemnly , thinking that for once there was more to one of Eve 's little homilies than she realized . " But you must n't brood , " she said . " Grace would n't have wanted you to . " " I doubt if she ever gave the matter much thought , " he said crushingly . Then , feeling that he had restored things to a normal footing , he fled to the more congenial atmosphere of the living-room . " Ah , there , Martin , " said Benson , waving with his blackrimmed spectacles . " You 're the last to arrive . Pull up a chair . We 've been discussing blackmail . " Among the many contrarinesses of human nature is the one which demands that a person be prouder of a doubtful accomplishment than of a genuine talent . The financier 's heart is won if you compliment him on his perfectly ordinary sauce bearnaise , the prima donna boasts of her indifferent petit point and the statesman of his mediocre paintings . So it was with the inhabitants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might justly be proud , they erected their snobbery on the " exclusiveness " of Alden Park . This exclusiveness derived , presumably , from the elaborate covenants which demanded of a prospective neighbor such  | essential virtues as Anglo-Saxon ancestry and respectability of income . When adolescent children , with the cynicism appropriate to their age , questioned the purpose of this exclusiveness , they were treated to a lecture on the importance of tradition in a world of debased and vanishing values , and told that when they grew up they would discover how much it meant to come from a community of only the very finest people . Usually the matter ended there , but occasionally one of the more difficult youngsters would ask : " The very finest people like Professor Benson ? " There was no dodging the fact that Benson was an embarrassment . Newcomers who had surmounted the obstacles to residencehood were especially dismayed by his presence . Yet nothing could be ( lone about it , for the Benson family far predated any other in the community , and indeed had once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprised . Until recently it had been a family of the utmost respectability , if of little eminence . " Good yeoman stock , " Grace 's father had called them , with more condescension than justice . Benson could number several ministers and one very minor astronomer among his forebears  --  but no one ( and perhaps this was what Grace 's father had meant ) with any talent for money . Benson 's father had had ambitions in that direction . He had sold off his land with enthusiasm , and invested the proceeds in stock which could not possibly fail to make him as wealthy as his new neighbors . Fortunately Benson 's mother had had a small income of her own ; enough to keep the household going and to put Bill through college . Bill proved a prodigious scholar . He took his B.A. ; polished off his M.A. while his parents were still arguing about whether they could afford the extra expense ; easily got an instructorship to support him while he disposed of the Ph.D . A born  | scholar and pedagogue , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of directions . But an early understanding of his own temperament , which was intensely disputatious , and the knowledge that teaching would have to supply all his livelihood , indicated some field where his eristicism could not harm his academic security . He settled on Medieval History , and by and large it was a sensible choice . To be too outspokenly accurate about the Crusades , the Inquisition , or some of the early Christian heresies , may evoke the Vatican 's official disapproval , but otherwise the controversies of the Middle Ages agitate only scholars no trustee has ever heard of . At an unusually early age Benson had been offered a full professorship at one of the four universities which Alden Park considered suitable for its male offspring , and he had remained there ever since . His eminence in his field would have made him an asset to any institute of learning , so the university chose to turn a blind eye to his extracurricular eccentricities . For , as if the exercise of discretion in his profession had exhausted him of that quality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition of orthodox as " an ox wearing the popular yoke , " and proceeded to belabor the ox enthusiastically and even joyously . For instance , he advocated the legitimization of prostitution , arguing that making it illegal had deprived women of the one creative outlet for which they had any natural ability ; and in the face of criticism insisted that this was complimentary rather than disrespectful to his wife , Eve . He urged the introduction of knighthood into the United States as a means of making the spoils system less expensive . He denounced all religions as irreligious , and contended that atheism was the opiate of the intelligensia.  | Politically he epitomized the Opposition . He called himself a " middle-of-the-road non-Aristotelian anarchist " ; since nobody else seemed to occupy this position or even understand it , he had an unassailable base from which to launch his polemics against all other political shades , left or right . He had strong opinions on every social and economic problem , and not a little of their strength was derived from their inconsistency . Somewhere along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once upon a time he had been backed into a corner and forced to defend his attitude ; he had replied with a savage attack on the sort of social system which permitted parvenus to snub the man who taught their children what little they would ever know . Evidently he later decided that this was an undignified position , for he never again would admit that there was any attitude to defend . " I just do n't pay any attention to the rest of Alden Park , " he would insist gravely . " This is my home ; I go my way , and they are free to go theirs . " The more paranoic of his neighbors felt that Benson 's way was a calculated affront . Alden Park was a suburb of pastel , modern houses with trimly landscaped lawns and flower beds . In the midst of these squatted the Benson Victorian monstrosity , painted an uncompromising , ugly dark brown  --  and generally in need of paint . The grounds were a squalor of vegetable plots , connected by patches of grass which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables . Biodynamic gardening was his hobby ; his compost pile was the child of his heart  --  and an offense in the nostrils of his southeast neighbor , whose protests were coldly overridden by lectures on the iniquities of artificial fertilizers . Something of a dandy at the university , at home Bill wore aged huaraches , filthy corduroys held up by a length of  | clothesline , and shirts of vivid and uncomplementary colors . Occasionally he omitted the shirt while working around his place  --  especially on afternoons when the Garden Club was having tea on Mrs. Mitchell 's lawn . And as if these indignities were not enough , he wrote of Alden Park ( for he was a frequent contributor of witty and contentious articles to the " class " magazines ) as if it were a private zoo . He called it " the middle-class suburb where I spend my summers " and retailed the habits of his neighbors in the manner of an aristocrat describing a rustic frolic , if he were being witty ; or , if contentious , like an anthropologist analyzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that the details on which Benson erected his structures of sarcasm were invariably accurate . For Alden Park did not offer a united front against the professor : there were those who found him entertaining company , sought entrance to the circle around him , and paid their way by tattling on their friends and neighbors . Gossip aside , conversation tended to be reasonably good at the Bensons ' , mainly because it was a major fetish of Bill 's . " People complain that conversation is a dying art and go back to their television sets , " he would say . " Actually , what is dying is original thinking , which was all that ever made conversation an art . Nowadays people read the same newspapers and magazines , go to the same movies and plays , let their books be chosen for them by the same clubs . After a while , with the inconsequential exceptions of politics and religion , they think the same thoughts . By the time they 're twenty-five , they are bored by their friends , and by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can blame them ? " If the dying art found shelter in the Benson salon it was a restricted shelter , fenced about with rules and regulations initiated by Benson himself " to keep the talk from degenerating  | into nonsense . " And if these rules not merely excluded Eve but seemed designed to let Bill indulge his fondness for monologue , it could n't be denied that he did his very best to provide both wit and variety , for the monologues ranged from the odd corners of his own special field , to almost anything under the sun . . . including , evidently , blackmail . " Blackmail ? " inquired Martin . " Martin is surprised , " Benson informed the others . " He pictures some overmarried businessman paying out money to suppress the evidence of a sexual indiscretion , and wonders why we are discussing anything so squalid . " " Why are you ? " Martin asked . " We are n't , of course , " Bill said crushingly . Martin pulled out a handkerchief to dry his palms , and sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others in the room . The Hollands were there , and the Wallaces . And , curled in one corner of the sofa , Sally Teal . But he had never paid her any attention before , and now contented himself with a fleeting smile of greeting . " It is probably the fault of detective novels , " Benson digressed , thus flouting one of his own rules , " that if a word has a criminal meaning this is the one we invariably think of first . Which is absurd . Now , in medieval Scotland , for example , blackmail meant the tribute that the small border landowners paid to the chiefs for immunity from being plundered . It was a sort of tax , collected by extortion , of course , but there was n't anything criminal about it . " With renewed suspicion Martin was reminded of the last time he had encountered the comparison between blackmail and taxation . " We were n't exactly talking about border landowners either , " Myra Holland said with sly triumph . She was the  | clever one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stagnation of suburban housewifery . " We were not , " Benson agreed , " but we might have been . As it happened , we were dealing with the non-financial variety : social blackmail . " " Bill was saying that society could n't get along without it . " " Not exactly , " said Benson . " I said that it was one of the two basic methods people have of getting what they want from other people . Bribery is the second . But bribery offers a real reward and implies a certain superiority of briber to bribee ; its frequency is limited by a natural scarcity of people who have anything worth while to offer . Blackmail , on the other hand , is a tactic of weakness and inferiority , and is therefore quite common . The blackmailer need n't have anything to offer , he merely threatens  --  and who is so weak as not to have a threat handy ? The wretched old lady keeps her adult children in line with threat of a heart attack , the meek wife threatens with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social relationship exists either on ? " Benson 's voice had the arresting flexibility of a trained speaker 's , but when you were waiting to insert an important question it was as maddening as the dreariest drone . His gestures were restrained to a constant fiddling with his blackrimmed spectacles , which he used much as a hypnotist 's bauble , till the raising of the shafts could produce the erect emphasis of a couple of exclamation points , or the abrupt resettling of the glasses upon his nose an intimidating effect on anyone who might be thinking of replying to a rhetorical question . He was a spare , meticulously graceful man in his fifties , with a mobile , thin-lipped mouth , deep-set eyes , and a shock of grey hair cropped close to his head in scholarly parody of undergraduate style . Myra Holland and Charlie Wallace listened with a ferretlike  | intensity , alert for a point of dispute that might show off their own cleverness . Their spouses listened in wary earnestness , ever determined to maintain their sophistication in the face of Benson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always , seemed the perfect audience , alert and perceptive ; it was only when she talked that she appeared a fool . And Sally Teal . . . ? At last Martin allowed his attention to fasten surreptitiously on Sally . And he was at once taken off guard by the irrelevant discovery that she was lovely . It was n't surprising that he had never noticed this before ; unlike virtually every other woman in Alden Park she made the least , instead of the most , of herself . Her orange-blonde hair was pulled straight back into an untidy bun . Iler pale eyebrows were left without assistance , and her lipstick seemed to have been applied more in anger than in vanity . Yet it was a lovely face  --  a sensitive and sensual face  --  the face of a passionate patrician . She was sitting in a corner of the sofa , schoolgirl fashion , with both feet tucked under her . Her figure was slender and long legged ; her breasts were high and small . Her hands , lying passively in her lap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nails . She was wearing a pale blue frock with an unbecoming neckline and a row of ugly yellow buttons down the front ; her only jewelry was a Mexican bracelet of silver and turquoises . She attended Benson 's onrolling sentences with easy tranquility . In repose her face had a certain blankness , so that Martin might have thought she was bored or thinking of something else , but for the occasional shy , secret smiles that appeared in response to Bill 's better turns of phrase . Each smile was the merest flicker of intelligence , vanishing in an instant to be replaced by enigmatic expressionlessness.  | Martin was intrigued  --  and attracted . He decided that it might be a pleasure getting to know Sally better , and hoped that that face was not the face of a blackmailer . Benson 's voice swooped to a full-throated and doubtless well-expressed conclusion . Ascertaining that nobody was about to leap in with rebuttals , Martin seized the opportunity to insert his question . " How did you get off on this subject ? " he inquired . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on his nose and peered at Martin over the rims , as if searching for cryptic significance in the question . Martin knew that the gesture was pure affectation  --  Benson was half blind without his glasses  --  but consciousness of ulterior motive made him nervous in the face of that shrewd inspection . " How did we get off on this subject ? " Benson repeated vaguely . " These things can be so difficult to retrace . Did n't you raise the matter , Sally , my dear ? " Martin snubbed out the cigarette he had just lighted . Sally was flushing at finding herself so suddenly the center of attention . " No , I did n't , " she protested . " You did . " " Did I ? " mused Benson . For an instant his questioning gaze flicked back at Martin , and then returned politely to Sally . " I was just telling what Dr. Finletter had said about Cousin Alec , " Sally said . " You were the one who called it blackmail . " " That 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectory is just opposite my place , " Sally explained to Martin . " Dr. Finletter often drops over to watch me work . Something he said the other day  --  though I know he did n't mean it that way  --  made me think that Cousin Alec 's kindness to inc might have come more from fear of public opinion than from affection for me . That was all I said . And then Bill  | started talking about blackmail . " " And I was absolutely right , " Benson said . " You used the fear of public opinion to blackmail Alec Frobisher into giving you his guest house to live in . It was n't the least bit like him to do it . Normally he does n't give anything away that he ca n't deduct twice over from his income tax . " " That is n't so , " Sally said . " He 's very generous . And I certainly did n't intend to blackmail him . " " You certainly did , " Benson said , " though I 'm sure you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more or less unconscious . " " Do n't pay any attention to Bill , " Martain said , explaining to himself that if he wanted to get to know Sally better there could be no harm in coming to her defense . " He 'd probably just been thinking about what he calls social blackmail and used what you said to launch into one of his lectures . " " Nothing of the kind , " said Benson , charging happily into battle . " I was quite accurate . Alec is only Sally 's second cousin . She 'd never met him in her life until three years ago . When she had finally been ? " Sally looked anguished , but it was Eve who interrupted warningly : " Bill ! " " Quite right , my dear , " Benson said . " When Sally was in some difficulty , " he continued , shying away from whatever confidence he had been about to disclose , " there was no one else she could turn to . But people do n't usually rush to shower kindnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this case , though , if Alec had declined to come to her rescue he would have felt like a dreadful stinker , and he knew it . Sally must have known it too . It 's nothing that she should be ashamed of . She 'd have been a fool not to take advantage of the only weapon she had . " " I 've paid back every single penny , " Sally said defiantly ,  | looking as though she were having considerable difficulty keeping from bursting into tears . Martin held down his curiosity , and stepped in heavily to change the subject before Sally got any more upset . But despite all his efforts on her behalf , when later in the evening he gallantly offered to drive her home , she said indifferently that the Hollands had to go right past her door , and they would drop her .  | It was on Friday of that same week that Agnes Herndon baffled the fifth in a series of Martin 's most plausible reasons for calling on her by the simple means of not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the novel which Agnes simply had to read into the hands of the pimplyfaced Herndon heir and retreated to his car with a profound conviction that Agnes was deliberately avoiding him . The afternoon was wasted . But inspiration seized him as he swung out of the drive , and he decided that there was a chance to retrieve the day after all . His way home went directly past Sally Teal 's place , and there was no reason why he should n't simply drop in . True , there was no reason why he should , but by now Martin was thoroughly tired of trying to think up ingenious pretexts ? which usually failed anyway  --  for every call he made on one of his suspects . Other people paid purely social calls ; why not he ? The Frobishers enjoyed the isolation afforded by four whole acres , and their house was located , or rather concealed , in the center of this ground . The driveway was guarded by  | Sally 's cottage , formerly the guest house  --  which the Frobishcrs quite seriously called " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and took the flagstone path up to the front door at a saunter calculated to give him the air of an offhand visitor . Several unrewarded assaults on the doorbell were beginning to make him think that his afternoon was in ( Iced wasted when Sally appeared around the corner of the house . She was wearing soiled dungarees and a man 's shirt with the sleeves rolled up ; her hair was caught back by a rubber band . " I thought I heard someone ringing , but I was n't sure , " she said . " Most people come straight back to the studio because that 's where I usually am. " " 1 ) o you mind visitors when you 're working ? " Martin asked as he picked his way across the lawn . " You said the other evening that Dr. Finletter often comes over , so I thought you might not . " " No , no . Come on back , " and she turned to lead the way . 1Ier manner was perfectly matter of fact : she did n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor pleased nor annoyed . The studio had originally been a two-car garage . The big doors had been sealed off , and a large window let into one wall . In front of the window stood what obviously was a potter 's wheel . . . and seated on a stool in front of the wheel , very much at his ease , was Dennis Morley . " Hello , Martin , " he said pleasantly enough . It was with some difficulty that Martin managed a polite smile and a hypocritical inquiry into the state of Dennis 's health . The presence of the bemoustached radical was unexpected but not really surprising , for he lived close by , but to Martin it was even more unwelcome than usual . From the very first his resolve to see as much as possible of his suspects had been qualified by the thought that it would be nice to  | eliminate the other four names and have Dennis 's left at the end . Sally swept assorted objects off a kitchen chair and pushed it in Martin 's direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had evidently called her : wrapping chartreuse dishes of some sort in newspapers and packing them in cartons with the aid of excelsior from a large packing case . Martin eyed the chair dubiously . It was quite dusty , and he very much wanted to wipe it off before sitting down . But the studio had such an air of messy and filthy functionalism , such an atmosphere of absorbed and dedicated toil , that he felt a display of fastidiousness would seem out of place . So he sat down firmly , and looked at Dennis with an expression that was intended to reveal his hope that the other would go away . Dennis fluffed out his moustache with a gentle forefinger . " How is your book coming along ? " he asked Martin . Sally looked up from her work with more interest than she had ever shown Martin before . " Do you write ? " she asked him . " I did n't know that . " " He 's writing a biography of his grandfather , Governor Pryor , " Dennis said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oilskin pouch . It was a part of his homespun pose : a pipe to go with the moustache . " Governor Clarence W. Pryor , " he mused aloud . " He was the one who called out the state militia to break up the strike at the Jordan Tool plant . Five of the strikers were shot . " " Yes , it was all very tragic , " Martin said easily . " Of course , in his old-fashioned way my grandfather thought he was doing the right thing . He did n't realize that his actions would be judged by the socialistic standards of fifty years later . " " Is it socialistic to regret that five men were wantonly killed ? " Dennis asked .  | " Everyone regretted it , " Martin said . " Especially my grandfather . " The pipe seemed to need the most careful attention . " When you come to that part of the biography , Martin , " Dennis said , " are you going to point out that the governor 's wife , your grandmother , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glared at Dennis in disgust . Out of sheer , spiteful malice the man had been prying . " The muckrakers of the day made enough scandal out of that wholly irrelevant coincidence , " he said stiffly . " It seems better forgotten . My grand1 mother had quite a few securities which she 'd inherited from her father ; I doubt that a list of them would make particularly Interesting reading . " " Do n't be too sure , " Dennis said . " Anyone interested enough in your grandfather to read a whole book about him would surely be interested to know that he had five men killed in the course of protecting one of his wife 's investmeats . " " That 's a vile way to put it ! " Martin snapped , finally outraged . " You radicals act as though you had a monopoly on love of humanity , but you can never think of any motives but vicious ones . The whole thing was just an unfortunate coincidellcc . " Dennis had been engrossed in lighting his pipe . Now he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have much of a reputation for it , " he said in his most patronizing manner , " but I am a professional critic . And if I might give you a bit of professional advice , it would be to bring such coincidences out into the open . Explain them away if you like , but do n't try to keep them concealed . Reviewers are often better informed than you might expect , and omissions make them Iuspicious.  | He stood up , still smiling in the face of Martin 's momentarily inarticulate fury at such presumption . " Bye-bye , Sally . " " You off ? " she asked over her shoulder . " I 'd best be running along , " Dennis replied . And he drifted out the door , leaving a swirl of aromatic smoke behind him . " You must n't let Dennis upset you so , " Sally said soothingly , though without turning around . " I know I should n't , " Martin agreed . He realized that he had not cut a very impressive figure in his clash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole episode away with some clever jibe at Dennis 's expense . But his sense of outrage was too great for cleverness . " He 's so utterly unfair , " Martin complained . " Dennis can be frightfully tactless . " Martin bridled slightly at the suggestion that he needed to be treated with tact . " He certainly can , but I 'm willing to overlook that , " he said magnanimously . " It 's his unfairness that I ca n't stomach . My grandmother 's holdings in the Jordan Tool Company amounted to about five percent of the outstanding stock ; that scarcely made her a major stockholder . " " I see , " Sally said . " My grandfather was a man of remarkable integrity who would never have let his private interests influence his public actions . " " I see , " Sally said . " When he became Senator he was responsible for some legislation that was considered quite advanced for its time . But you notice that Dennis did n't say a word about that . " Sally finished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time since Dennis had left she was looking at Martin . " Your grandfather sounds like a fine man , " she said seriously . " Do you remember him well ? "  | " Reasonably well , " Martin said . " I was nearly eleven when he died . " " Was he very fond of you ? " " No , I do n't think he liked children much , so he used to give me silver dollars by way of apology . " Sally seemed interested , so he went on . " He was tall and very erect and I think he wore a corset . He had a white spade beard and bushy white eyebrows and very gentle blue eyes . I know it 's a cliche , but when I was small I used to think God must look exactly like grandfather . " Martin found that his anger was gone and he was much more relaxed now , and realized that Sally had brought this about quite deliberately . " No , of course I do n't remember him as a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but from all I 've been able to find out , he really was a fine man . " Sally laughed one of the friendliest laughs that he had ever heard from a woman . " I 'm sure he was , " she agreed , and then turned back to her work . Martin marveled at her unquestioning acceptance of his presence . He had strained at excuses for coming , and she seemed to find it natural that he had come without one . He decided that she must be so accustomed to having people drop in on her while she was working that she simply did n't think anything about it . Undistracted now , he looked about him curiously . The floor was a seeming chaos of crates , boxes and tins , many of them covered with sheeting against the dust . The long wall where the doors had been blocked off was composed entirely of shelves , holding the results of Sally 's labors . The light there was dim , but Martin could make out that at one end the pieces stood separately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were drying or waiting their turn to be fired . At the other end , murky splashes of color indicated pieces finished and glazed , and these were sometimes piled in stacks . Along the  | window wall , to the left of the potter 's wheel , was a long work table , the far end of it laden with a surprisingly tidy array of jars , bottles , paper sacks , assorted unidentifiable equipment , and three mortars . On the end of the table near the window stood three or four finished pieces of green or purplish glaze . Martin marked these out for examination since he could see no way of reaching the shelves without stepping over Sally . " You and Dennis do n't get on very well , do you ? " she said . " I 've noticed that before . " " Oh , we 're always at each other 's throats . I suppose it 's mostly my fault , but he irritates me so with his juvenile theories on politics and such . " " You think his ideas are ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the faintest notion what Sally 's opinions might be , and if she tended to agree with Dennis he did n't want to offend her . He got up and walked over to the window , groping for some way to temporize without actually contradicting anything Sally might have heard him say in the past . In the garden across the street Dr. Finletter pottered about in the bright autumn afternoon , bringing vast energy to small deeds . " These socialistic ideas are all very fine in theory , " he said finally , " but it 's just foolishness to try to apply them to the world as it is today . People just are n't that advanced yet , and probably never will be . " " You do n't think very much of people , do you ? " " I suppose I do n't , by and large . " " Do n't you think that maybe progress comes out of people trying to pretend that they 're better than they really are ? " Sally asked . " After all , if you pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit . " " You may have a point there , " Martin said , but he had n't  | really been listening . He had picked up one of the pieces he 'd spied from his chair and was examining it with considerable surmise . It was the head of an African warrior , about twelve inches high including the pottery base , with a deep purple glaze that was somehow at once dull and lustrous . The features were exquisitely done , to such an extent that one could find in them a wealth of character . The expression was one of stern sadness , yet there were traces of sensuality , mockery , cruelty , and an almost feminine sensitivity . It was a beautiful work of art , one that Martin would have liked to own . He wanted to know the price of it , but shied away from the indelicacy of asking . But he had to revise his opinion of Sally on the spot : she was unquestionably an artist , and a fine one . For most of an hour after that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he enjoyed himself thoroughly . When he left , Sally complimented him prettily on having been her first visitor who had n't badgered her with questions about her work . She did n't ask him to come again , but she obviously took it for granted that he would . On his way home , Martin remembered the way Sally had soothed his ruffled feelings after Dennis had left . It had been done quite deliberately and quite effortlessly . Someone , virtually a stranger , had been upset , and Sally 's instinct had been to repair the damage . And she 'd done it . Grace never would have done such a thing . Perhaps Grace could n't have done it so skillfully if she 'd tried , but it never would have occurred to her to try . Even with her own husband , much less a comparative stranger . Once when he had been moody and shaken , after a rare outburst of temper provoked by the stupidity of one of her friends , he had suggested to Grace that the slightest effort  | on her part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in total incomprehension . He was a grown man , she had pointed out , and if he wanted to let himself get so upset over nothing she could n't imagine what he expected her to do about it . Which was perfectly just  --  but who on earth wanted perfect justice from his wife ? Grace 's appearance had promised an emotional generosity , but through no fault of her own the promise had been a lie . She had seemed both intensely feminine and deeply sensitive ? but she certainly had not been sensitive , and Martin had never even been able to determine how feminine she actually was . He had seen her first across an exceedingly crowded room , and a noisy one as well . The Barnetts , who lived in bohemian casualness in the Village , had been giving one of their periodic brawls . Martin had then had an apartment , which he studiously called a " flat , " in the East Fifties , because he preferred a good address to more expansive living in a less expensive neighborhood . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Barnett cocktail parties were not to be missed . He had picked up several charming and accommodating girls there at one time or another . He had spotted Grace as a newcomer as soon as he arrived at the party . Undeniably it had been her body which had first attracted his attention : a full-breasted , voluptuous body , and her stance  --  she had been posing by the fireplace  --  had shown it off superbly . Her vis-a-vis , a goggle-eyed young dancer , had been even more goggle-eyed than usual in his efforts to peer down the low-cut bosom of her dress . The dress was a black cocktail frock of that deceptive simplicity which is popularly supposed to indicate a Fifth Avenue exclusive and which nowadays is just as apt to mean medium-priced Madison . But Martin knew more about wornen 's  | clothes than most men  --  he had had brief but educational affairs with two fashion models and an editor of a fashion magazine  --  and he knew the real thing when he saw it . This frock was the real thing . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trifle too much . The crowning touch , which he noticed last of all , was the almost remarkable homeliness of her face , set off by the carriage and comportment of a reigning beauty . Obviously here was none of the Barnett 's theatrical riffraff , however accommodating , and Martin hastened to make inquiries . He learned that her name was Grace Blanchard , that she lived in a suburb not ten miles from his own birthplace , and that she had come to see a former schoolfriend who was staying with the Barnetts and in whose honor ( as if an excuse were necessary ! ) the party was being given . With this information in hand Martin cut away the young ( lancer , introduced himself as practically a former neighbor , and within five minutes had trotted forth the names of half a dozen acquaintances who were also friends of Grace 's . He had found her cool , self-assured , witty and charming . By the time he got home that night , after dropping her at her station , he had already half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infatuation in the ensuing days of courtship there could be no doubt whatsoever . Grace was temperamentally incapable of the simplest dissimulation ; he could never blame her for having assumed the virtues which he had seen in her then . Ile had bedded her two weeks before the wedding . The voluptuous body had proved somewhat of a disappointment : without confinement the full bosom was a little on the saggy side , and a ragged appendectomy scar offended Martin 's fastidiousness . But of the strength of Grace 's passionateness  | he could make no complaint . It was crude , to be sure , and misdirected , but he had no doubt that under his expert tutelage she would make an excellent lover . It was discovering the fallacy in this blithe assumption which had otherwise opened his eyes . Grace had n't the slightest interest in becoming an excellent lover . She obviously felt that to place a well-sexed body at his disposal should be enough for him , and concentrated on her own satisfaction , enjoying him for his endurance rather than his finesse . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this was quite typical of Grace . Under her facade , which was simply the habit pattern established by what is called a " good up-bringing , " she was a monstrously selfsatisfied and self-centered woman . She had no warmth , only gregariousness ; no sensitivity , only a certain shrewd acuteness . Her good taste was simple snobbery , and what Martin had taken for a rather charming lack of possessiveness was really indifference . His disillusionment was not quite complete : Grace 's money was real enough . And since the money had been a considerable part of her charm , Martin had honestly tried to make the best of the situation . If he had failed , it had surely been largely Grace 's fault . After a time , living with indifference and insensitivity could do terrible things to a man 's ego . Not that Grace would have understood this . If a flash of foresight had somehow seized her in that moment before Martin had struck the fatal blow , she would have stared in innocence and most probably asked : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards she had done nothing wrong . In fact she had often remarked , in the course of bringing her own style of incomprehension to bear on somebody else 's fall from virtue , that she herself had never done a single thing in her life of which she had cause to be ashamed . And it was  | probably true . But Martin sometimes wondered if it would have shamed her to understand that a reasonably kindly and well-meaning person , who had once loved her , could murder her in cold blood and never once feel a qualm of conscience afterward . A few days later Martin saw Sally again  --  at Agnes Herndon 's cocktail party . Under ordinary circumstances this was the sort of function that Martin avoided , but he assumed that most of his suspects would be there , and that meant that he had to go . The more he saw of them , the greater the possibility that someone would let something slip . And Martin had a little trap he wanted to try out . His assumption proved correct . Bill Benson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing , but the rest of Martin 's suspects were there . So were a great many other people . Agnes 's parties were a tradition . Given with little enthusiasm and attended with still less , they existed , as do most traditions , on sheer social impetus . She gave two parties each year , one in the spring and another in the fall , and obviously felt that they satisfied obligations contracted during the rest of the year . In reality they satisfied nothing but etiquette . Hostesses who suffered Agnes for Wally 's sake throughout the year suffered her parties for the same reason , and dragged their husbands along to share the suffering . Logic had nothing to do with the matter . The canapes were done by the same couple who catered almost every party in Alden Park , so there could be no complaint on that score . But on the liquid side there was the invariable bowl of punch , where citrus juices struggled to conceal the inferiority of the liquor . Agnes looked surprised and hurt if you asked for a highball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same request twice a year for the past decade . Martin , whose record for absenteeism was exceeded only by two indomitable husbands who had lived in Alden Park longer than he , had no standing at all , and Agnes simply overlooked his plea for scotch . She told him firmly that she had simply adored the detective novel he had lent her , except that the victim reminded her so much of poor dear Grace , and with equal firmness that he had to try the punch  --  she was sure he 'd like it . And she filled a cup for him herself and stood watching until he 'd downed the first swallow , as though that would alter his opinion . Across the room he noticed Dennis and Gerald Marshall talking together , and deciding to kill two birds with one stone he headed in their direction . IIe was stopped several times by kindly old ladies who patted his hand and told him encouragingly how wonderfully well he was looking , and how glad they were to see that he was getting out a bit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Gerald had trapped Dennis with some story of a triumph on the links . Martin waited politely till the nineteen foot putt had miraculously fallen into the cup , and then broke in quickly , to gain as much advantage as he could from the element of surprise . " You 're just the two I 've been looking for , " he said with what sounded in his own ears like very false enthusiasm . " I 've been thinking of getting myself a really good camera , and I want some advice . I think you 're both devotees ... ? " It was his plan to observe whatever reactions he might evoke , and make what sense he could of them later on . Dennis looked at him oddly , denied knowing one end of a camera from the other , and seized the opportunity to escape . Gerald , on the other hand , pounced on the chance to show off an area of knowledge , and proceeded to deliver himself of an exhaustive technical lecture , wholly incomprehensible  | to Martin , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German models from which they were derived . Before Martin could act on his instinct to flee a new idea came to him , and he summoned up reserves of patience . When the lecture showed signs of running down , he introduced the subject of telephoto lenses . And since the lecture had shown that Gerald 's knowledge of Japanese cameras was based on covetousness rather than possession , Martin inquired specifically if Gerald owned a telephoto lens himself . " Two of them , " boasted Gerald . He indicated that they had both been presents from his darling Barbara , and sighed a nostalgic sigh for the vanished days of affluence . But they were lovely lenses , and he had kept them in perfect condition . He went on to explain the advantages of each . At great length . Martin sustained his expression of intelligent attention and inwardly considered the information he had gained . The blackmailer had expressed a yearning for fancy lenses ; Marshall was obviously well supplied . The blackmailer 's remark conceivably might have been intended to mislead , but Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite Prospect Drive offered nothing to attract anyone blase in the matter of telephoto lenses , but might easily have been chosen by a novice eager to experiment . So the very best brand of logic supported Martin 's conviction that Gerald lacked the wits to carry off such highpowered duplicity as he would now be engaged in if he were the blackmailer . Marshall was out , one of the five suspects was eliminated  --  which was all to the good even if it were a somewhat unexpected result of his little trap . As soon as he decently could he thanked Gerald for having been a great help , and drifted away . Sally was momentarily by herself on a love-seat , looking very fetching in a dress of  | pale green linen , but somehow less natural than she did in her working costume . He hesitated between joining her and hunting out Wally , who presumably knew where the scotch was hidden , and decided that the scotch could wait . " I did n't expect to find you here , " he remarked , dropping into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , I do n't know . I would n't have thought it was the sort of crowd you 'd find amusing . " Sally looked back at the shrill crowd swirling in front of them . " Do people always have to be amusing ? " she asked finally . " Well , at a cocktail party it helps . " " Agnes has been very kind to me , " Sally said , and it was meant to be an explanation . " She can be , you know . And besides , I like watching people . The way they stand and move and gesture ; their expressions . It 's the sculptress in me , I expect . Look at Cousin Alec over there with his head thrown way back . He looks so fierce and proud and noble  --  and actually he 's just looking at Dennis through the bottoms of his bifocals . Someday I may want to do a cinnamon bear at bay , and then I 'll remember Cousin Alec 's expression . " Martin smiled and tried to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as lines and curves , postures and poses . But he could n't do it . All he could see were the same old tiresome faces , the quick , exaggerated smiles and the empty gestures . It would be nice to have a way , as Sally did , to make them seem interesting . He was so tired of them as they were , and especially tired of envying them the complacency that made them blind to his contempt . " Do you find them amusing ? " Sally inquired . Whatever a petard might be , Martin felt hoist by his own . He groped for some way of accounting for his presence that  | would n't sound too frivolous . He was rescued by their hostess . Agnes had been prowling through the party trying to look like a capable hostess on whose ministrations the success of a party depends . Now she caught Martin 's eye and came toward them , shaking her dyed red head and wagging an appallingly roguish finger . " I 'm ashamed of you , Martin Pryor , " she announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here you are chasing the pretty girls . " She pretended shock , then smiled brightly and wandered away on some new errand of unconscious destruction . Which was just like Agnes . Martin did his best to act as though nothing had happened , but somehow the tete-a-tete had been spoiled .  | Mrs. Hodges never said Good morning , but she always had a remark to bring in with the orange juice . Today it was : " You have n't had anyone in of an evening since Mrs. Pryor passed away . Not once . " Martin concluded that either Mrs Hodges 's calendar of respect for the dead now permitted a little private socializing , or that she had some scheme of her own . Possibly both . But he had already noticed among the morning mail an envelope that was certainly a second communication from the blackmailer , so he merely agreed , " I have n't , have I ? " and declined to enlarge on the matter despite Mrs. Hodges 's interested stare . Temporarily baffled , she retreated to organize her next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter , but sipped his orange juice tranquilly and considered blackmail in general and his own personal puzzle in particular . By the thoughtful logic in which he took so much pride , he had reduced his suspects to four : Sally and Agnes , Benson and Dennis Morley . The problem now was to eliminate three of these . It was gratifying that the camera " trap " had removed Gerald Marshall from the list , but no further result could be expetted  | from this approach . Dennis 's protest of ignorance Martin discounted , and he had learned that the other three dabbled slightly in the art . As for the matter of getting samples of various typescripts to compare with the letters , this scarcely seemed worth the bother . Martin was not disposed to place too much faith in such physical clues , and was prepared to concede that a passably sensible blackmailer could avoid any of the tangible errors beloved of Sherlock Holmes . But to remain anonymous , the blackmailer had to write letters , and in those he could not help but leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the clues Martin was counting upon : psychological clues that he would pounce on and put to use , just as he had so ingeniously used one already . Of course , ingenuity was all very well , but he had to be grateful for having been given an opportunity to exercise it . Ile had been lucky that the blackmailer had not confined himself to a bare statement of the facts ; if he had , then Martin would have been stopped before he had even got started . A simple statement would have sufficed  --  yet the blackmailer had rambled on , showing off , giving himself away at every turn . Was there some significance to be gleaned from this ? Was the blackmailer naturally a garrulous person ? Or was he normally uncommunicative , and here was trying to hide behind a smokescreen of words ? There was no way of telling , but Martin felt confident that , whatever inspired them , words were bound to be revealing . He reached for the second letter , hoping for new revelations , but was interrupted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was thinking , " she announced , " that Thursday night would be a good time , if you wanted to have someone in for dinner . I could stay late to clean up , this Thursday night . "  | " You could ? " Martin asked , patiently awaiting developments . Mrs. Hodges never went at things head-on , but resented being hurried through her circumlocutions . " And I 'd like Friday off , if you do n't mind , " she added artlessly . " My sister and I want to get in town for some shopping and the new show at Radio City . " " Of course , " Martin said , amused at this confirmation of Benson 's theory . In her own fashion , Mrs. Hodges was distinctly a strong personality , and her technique of getting her own way had always been one of straightforward bribery . " Well , perhaps I 'll take advantage of your suggestion . I 've been thinking of having the Bensons in for bridge . Let 's say dinner for four , unless I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Hodges had left the room he slit open the envelope . Four photographs tumbled out ; Martin inspected them curiously . One , somewhat blurred ( as if the photographer had been agitated ) , showed Martin at the edge of the road looking down on the wrecked car ; the next two showed him standing near the blazing wreck , and beginning to climb back up towards the road again ; and the last looked much like the first except that the car was burning . Martin puzzled over this last one , since he did n't remember having paused to look back at the scene of his crime . Then he realized that the pictures were out of order : this last should really be the third , and it showed him just before he had jumped down the face of the hill to make it appear as if he had been thrown free of the car . Martin realized that he had been very lucky . The photographs were excellent substantiation for a story  --  but without the photographer to tell the story and explain the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing that Martin could n't explain away . The pictures alone might embarrass him , but they would never hang him .  | Somewhat relieved , he turned to the letter , which was considerably shorter than the first . " My dear Martin : " I 've never envied you that smart-alecky cleverness you 're so proud of , and which you use mainly for sneering at other people and for finding new ways to make fun of old virtues . But I admit I could use some of that cleverness now to help me find a completely safe way to bring about a certain exchange of money . It 's not an easy problem at all , and you ca n't blame me for being cautious . " But I doubt if I can expect you to sympathize . Never mind , in time I will find a solution . And in the meanwhile you might as well be collecting five hundred dollars in unclean bills of small denomination . " This will be a quarterly installment . Two thousand a year seems a modest demand , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , which you certainly enjoy , but which seems to me uncommonly useless even by the standards of Alden Park . " I enclose a few photographs that may interest you . " Martin grinned coldly at the letter . It contained several points that would merit considerable thought , but above all it had reminded him of one characteristic of the blackmailer 's which he had tended to overlook . " He does n't like me one damned bit , " Martin murmured to himself . " In fact , he hates my guts . " It would be good to remember that when he had found out who the blackmailer was , and it was time to consider what to do about him . They had coffee in the living-room , so as to leave the dining-room free for Mrs. Hodges to clear away . In one corner  | the bridge table was already set up , with green suede cover and fresh cards , a portent of things to come . Sally evidently found it an intimidating sight . " I 'm afraid I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his quest for a fourth it had occurred to him that she might play , and after some protests she had allowed herself to be persuaded . " Now do n't be coy , " Benson said . " You 're probably much better than Martin deserves . He would n't know what to do with a first-rate partner . " " But really , it 's years since I 've played , " she insisted . " I simply have n't had the time . " Martin winced inwardly . In the most innocent fashion Sally had a way of making him feel thoroughly frivolous . " It 's just a game , " he said insincerely . " There 's no need to take it so seriously . " " That 's right , " Benson said to Sally . " You 'll find that Martin takes the game quite light-heartedly  --  as long as he 's winning . " " Oh , stop trying to frighten the girl , " Martin said . " I had enough trouble persuading her to play at all . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained . " Eve is cracking up . The other evening , against the Wallaces , she missed an absolute baby end-play . " " You 've been rubbing that in for days but it is n't true , " his wife replied . " The end-play would have worked , as it happened , but Charlie had n't bid so how was I to know he had all the cards ? " In her indignation she had lapsed into a whiny twang , but now she caught herself and resumed her usual super-elegance of diction . " Keep tokking , " she said threateningly , " just keep tokking and I 'll trump ev'dy ace you hold this evening . " This wildly affected accent of Eve 's had long since led  | his level . Blonde rinses and careful make-up preserved the remains of what once must have been an exceptional prettiness , and Eve still displayed , to the world at least , a figure that Aldous Huxley would have called " pneumatic . " But nothing could conceal the fact that she talked like a fool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her inflection , she clothed her drab ideas in an archly ponderous vocabulary that displayed an incurably provincial notion of how a professor 's wife should talk . Whatever his friends might think of this mismating , Benson seemed perfectly content with it , and his unfailing courtesy towards Eve was the one sign of good breeding which his enemies would allow him . But if Eve was a total loss conversationally , Benson 's position in Alden Park was such that he could cope with that problem very neatly . If you went to the Bensons ' , and conversation was the order of the evening , Eve was tacitly reduced to the status of a caterer . But if the evening were to be devoted to bridge ( and if you invited the Bensons out it was always for bridge ) , then Eve was permitted to shine . For she was one of those people with an uncanny flair for cards , even though hopeless in all other respects . Eve was probably the best bridge and canasta player in Alden Park , and as such was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anathema . To Martin , who hated above all things being bested at anything by someone he despised , Eve represented a source of continual frustration . He enjoyed playing against her , horribly resented losing , yet could derive no real sense of triumph from the occasions when he won . It was an ideally unsatisfactory relationship . As they moved to the bridge table , Martin watched for the hundredth time , but with undiminished awe , the transformation that Eve achieved in the space of a few feet . There was  | a perceptible shift of personality : she arose from the armchair in futility , she sat down at the table in competence . " A fifth of a cent ? " Benson inquired . Sally 's dismay was evident . " I think Sally would prefer to play for a twentieth , " Martin said firmly . " I 'll carry the remainder . " From Sally 's expression it seemed likely that she would have preferred to play for nothing at all , but she made no comment . She was as rusty as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration kept her from making any bad blunders . The cards were running their way , and Martin bid in such fashion as to see to it that he played most of the contracts . Eve had been looking about her in a vaguely perturbed fashion between hands , and finally announced that the room looked different . " The breakfront ! " she exclaimed a moment later . " Grace 's beautiful , beautiful breakfront . You 've moved it . " I always thought it made that wall look awfully cluttered , " Martin said . " But where did you put it ? " " There was n't any place to put it . I sold it . " Eve looked stricken . " But Grace was so fond of it , " she mourned . " It belonged to her great-grandmother . " " I know , " Martin said shortly . The sarcasms which leapt to his mind were repressed out of sheer habit here in his own living-room . Grace had made such an issue of the way he treated Eve : " How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd asked one time . " It 's not that , " Martin had said ; " I just ca n't stand her sly delight in pointing out my mistakes at the bridge-table . " " What would you expect ? " Grace had demanded . " I doubt if she understands half the things I say , " he 'd  | retorted , surprised that even Grace would think otherwise . " She can understand your tone of voice , " Grace had said ; " and , anyway , it makes me uncomfortable . " And eventually he 'd learned to desist , at least in his own home , not from any eagerness to spare Grace discomfort , but simply because she 'd nagged at him . Now it annoyed him to have Eve nag him about Grace . It particularly annoyed him to have it happen in front of Sally  --  to have Grace even mentioned in front of Sally  --  which was preposterous , but that was the way he felt . Benson crashed in with the statement that he 'd never thought much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game was suspended for a few moments while the old argument of modern furniture versus antiques was dusted around a bit . Late in the evening , when the game was breaking up , Sally remarked to Martin that she had n't seen him since the afternoon of Agnes 's party . Martin mumbled that he had been busy , and added quite inaccurately that he had been meaning to drop in at the studio when he had a chance . Actually it had taken considerable strength of will to keep liirnself from dropping in at the studio . What had stopped him was the recognition that there had been more than a little accidental truth in Agnes 's tactless gibe about his chasing after Sally . There was no doubt that he was much attracted I , y her . And he did n't want to be , not now . Sally was a suspect . It did terrible things to his vanity , which was shaky enough at the moment , to contemplate getting himself involved with the person who was blackmailing him . Martin 's vanity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a conviction that he was a superior human being . . . and in a number of respects he undoubtedly was . To begin with , if doing a number of different things passably well was any criterion , his vanity was not misplaced .  | He played a good game of bridge , and whlen one considers how many people play the game badly , the talent is worth mentioning . He played the piano well . Not exceptionally well ; not a cut below concert level , but several cuts below . Yet on his music rack there was a copy of Debussy 's Children 's Corner Suite ; most amateurs could only hack their way through it , and Martin could play it well enough to give pleasure to a critical ear . He wrote well enough that his biography of his grandfather , if he ever finished it , might prove to be dull , might prove to be stuffy , but would be written in nicely polished English . And he was technically most proficient in bed ; a quality which wives will testify is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides a number of lesser accomplishments : not a bad showing at all . Most people could probably not claim so much . On that ground alone Martin could have maintained a fair justification of his superiority . But apart from these considerations , Martin 's consciousness of superiority rested on an instinctive recognition of a profounder talent than all the others . Man 's superiority to the other animals lies chiefly in his unique ability to mold his environment , instead of being molded by it , and Martin was something of a genius at doing exactly that . Out of the environmental materials at his disposal he had built for himself a life perfectly suited to his own character . His methods may have been ruthless , may have been viciously selfish , but they undeniably had been  --  up to a point  --  completely successful , which was the same as saying that they were survivalmethods . Up to a point  --  there was the catch . For the act of murder had modified his superiority to that of a predatory creature ,  | and the law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful ... or dead . There was no longer such a thing as a partial success . So there could be no peace in Martin 's own private universe till the blackmailer was ferreted out and dealt with . Until that was accomplished , it was obviously essential that he devote his attention to nothing else , and that he keep a clear head , undisturbed by irrelevant emotions . Even if Sally was not his unknown enemy ( and all his instincts assured him that she was not ) , it would be foolish in the extreme to let himself get involved with her now . Besides , it would be ridiculous to slip into any sort of interesting relationship until he could give his whole attention to it . Yet , when he was driving Sally home and she mentioned that she had just finished a new piece , wanted his opinion on it , and why did n't he drop around tomorrow afternoon ? he could not find in him the strength of will to resist the temptation . It seemed a dismally long time since he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable woman at his side , and he reveled in the innocent delight . It was an adolescent boy who said , almost shyly , " Of course , I 'd like to come . " And when they stopped in front of her house , Martin was taken with an adolescent urge to try for a good-night kiss . But Sally forestalled him , perhaps unconsciously , by saying " Good night " briskly and slipping out of the car before he could think of an excuse to detain her . " Usually I 've decided on a glaze long before I 've finished a piece , " Sally explained the next afternoon , " but not this time . What would you suggest ? " The figurine , about a foot high , was that of a coquettishlooking  | colt . Martin thought it disappointingly commonplace , especially after the other things he 'd seen , and could n't feel that it mattered much what color it was glazed . But since something was expected of him he said : " Green ? Maybe a sort of turquoise green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll see what Dennis suggests . I 've asked him over , too . " " Oh , " said Martin , doing his best to keep the outrage out of his voice . Sally blandly overlooked the fact that Martin 's best had been quite inadequate . " I suppose the reason it does n't suggest a color is that it 's so damn ' conventional . That 's not my fault ; it 's part of a special order . One of my best customers wants some animals and specifically asked for a cute colt . This should please him . It 's so cute it 's nauseating . " " Dennis will probably like it , " Martin said . " Dennis 's taste is every bit as good as yours , " Sally said . She smiled up at him , and for the first time Martin realized that underneath the seriousness she had quite a bit of the imp in her . " In fact , " she added , " that 's why I decided to see if I could n't get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a lot in common . " Normally Martin would have been furious at the thought of anyone presuming to tamper with one of his animosities . But there was a truly charming innocence about Sally 's approach that took him completely off his guard , and before he recovered it occurred to him that he had very practical reasons for wanting to establish a less contentious relationship with Dennis . So he merely murmured a noncommittal " Do you think so ? " and returned his attention to the figurine . " If it 's a special order , I 'm surprised your customer did n't suggest a color himself . "  | " Oh , they never do that , " Sally said . " Why not ? " " Glazes are so unpredictable that it 's simpler for them to wait and see what I 've sent , and then plan their color schemes . " Then she noticed Martin 's very blank expression , and went on to explain . It seemed that whereas she did a certain amount of conventional stuff ( " junk " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these figurines were her specialty ( and main source of income ) and went only to interior decorators . Each figurine went with a bowl or ashtray in matching glaze ; every pair was unique ; and they were known to the trade as " Teal Conversationals . " ( Sally winced when she came to that part of the explanation . ) Evidently they were very much in vogue , and the decorators who used them built their color schemes around them . " How much do they sell for ? " Martin asked . " I never know , " Sally replied . " Whatever the traffic will bear , I expect . I get two hundred a pair ; sometimes two-fifty . I t all depends . " Martin was impressed . He was quite aware that her output must be limited , and that she doubtless had to work like a beaver to show a profit at the end of a year . Nevertheless , it was impressive that she was able to command such a sum . licit he had n't much chance to dwell on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as he spied Martin he reached for his pipe . " Hello , Martin , " he said . " Hi , Sal . " She beckoned him over to the window with one imperious finger , and then pointed at the figurine . " It stinks , " Dennis said promptly . " Never mind that , " Sally said . " What color ? " Dennis thought about it for long enough to fill his pipe and  | set it going . " Dark red , " he said finally . " That very dark Chinese red . It 's the only thing that will give this coy beast any distinction at all . " Sally nodded slowly . " I think you 're right . " Martin was annoyed at himself for having thrown out his answer in such an offhand manner . There was no special virtue to dark red , but at least Dennis had taken his time , treated the question seriously , come up with a thoughtful suggestion . Martin felt that he had lost face , and fumbled for a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that seemed futile now that Sally had taken a view . So he looked for another direction in which he might take the offensive . " I do n't entirely agree with you , Dennis , " he said , " but I 'm not able to differ with you . " " An impediment in your perversity ? " Dennis asked solicitously . " Never that , " said Martin . Feeling that Dennis had thrown away his advantage by rushing to commit the first hostility , Martin made his own good temper all the blander as he continued : " No , it 's just that Sally is determined that you and I must become friends . " The situation he had created delighted Martin . His headlong approach had a ring of manly forthrightness to it , and also left him in a position of sophistication that Dennis would have difficulty duplicating . It was gratifying that Sally seemed amused rather than appalled by the line he had taken , but he was disappointed that Dennis gave no sign of being in the least discomforted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dennis remarked . Martin threw his last bombshell : " She insists that we have a lot in common , you and I. " Dennis considered the notion with an air of faint distaste ,  | and then shrugged . " I 've learned the hard way that Sally is usually right about people , " he said . " I would n't dream of contradicting her until I 'd heard her reasons . " Sally was laughing at the two of them . " In a lot of ways you 're so much alike it 's funny , " she told them . " That does n't mean that we have anything in common , though , " Dennis pointed out . " Oh , but you do , " Sally said . " Quite a bit . You 'd be surprised how much alike your tastes are . But you found one little thing to disagree about and you 're both so pugnacious that you 've been fighting about it ever since . " " Surely you do n't expect us to agree that politics is just a ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shows how much alike you are , " Sally retorted . " You disagree , but you both take your politics so seriously as to go on fighting over them , even though neither one of you has any expectation of converting the other . " Dennis and Martin looked at one another . They agreed silently that Sally had a kind of point  --  and agreed , too , that there were some things you just could n't expect a girl like Sally to understand : that a conflict of politics on their level meant a clash of two utterly opposite basic philosophies ... . " You 're both so sure that you 're right , " Sally continued , " that each of you assumes the other must be a different breed of animal to be able to disagree . " Dennis had a vaguely guilty expression , as though he were renouncing male chauvinism forever , and Martin imagined he must look the same way . " Which is just silly , " Sally said . " I 'm not saying for a moment that you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why you should . But if you stay away from the things you clash over , I promise you 'll find enough you can agree on to get along perfectly well in one another 's company .  | And you wo n't make other people so uncomfortable . " Martin gamely maintained his position as the large-minded sophisticate . " I 'll try anything , " he volunteered . " Will someone suggest a non-controversial subject ? " " Gossip , " said Sally firmly , and started to busy herself about her work . " I 'd be willing to bet that you dislike all the same people and would enjoy hearing each other tear them apart . " And to Martin 's unpleased surprise , she was absolutely right .  | " Martin ? " Sally 's voice crackled in his ear . " You have to heIp me . " Her tone was not urgent , simply matter-of-fact . Martin was charmed . He found most appealing the non-flirtatious fashion in which she had calmly accepted his presence in her life , even to the extent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course , " he said warmly . " I 'm afraid it 's going to be a dreadful bore for you . " She did n't bother to thank him ; she had obviously taken it for granted that he would help . " I 'm awfully sorry . . . but there 's no one else . I 've tried Dennis , but he 's tied up this afternoon . " But this was too matter-of-fact . Martin let himself sound hurt : " You should have called me first . I 'll be delighted to do anvthing I can . " No , you wo n't , " Sally told him . " But it 's a situation , and I 'm no good at coping with situations by myself . " Martin found that difficult to believe , but mumbled sympathetically into the phone and reached for a cigarette . " Agnes is being patronizing , " Sally explained . " Some old school chum , obviously very rich , is staying with her and  | Agnes is dragging her over here to show her my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy . Agnes has been kind to me  --  I ca n't stop her from coming , but she simply refuses to understand that I will not sell my own stuff . Under any circumstances . Ever . " " Mmmm , " Martin contributed . " In the first place , I 'm under contract to the store and under obligation to the decorators to sell only through them . In the second place , I just plain do n't want to . " " I see , " said Martin . " Well , Agnes does n't . She probably thinks she 's doing me a great big favor , bless her foolish heart . " " But what can I do ? " " Come and give me moral support , " Sally said . " Distract Agnes 's attention while I explain to her friend where she can buy my stuff if she really wants to . And sit on her , I mean Agnes , if she tries to explain to me in front of her friend how I can charge a whole lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do whatever I can , " Martin said . " What time are they supposed to be coming ? " " You 're a dear . About four , Agnes said . " Martin got to the studio at a quarter of , and his greeting was , " But would n't you make more of a profit if you sold direct ? " " You ca n't make things and market them too . " At the moment she was making dust-raising efforts to tidy the place a bit , and looking very annoyed about it . " This ruins my whole schedule for today . " " I suppose your regular customers would n't like it if you competed with them , " Martin mused . " There 's that , " Sally said . " But I think it 's mostly a matter of temperament . I just have n't the sort that would enjoy holding  | up something I 'd made and saying , in essence , If you want this beautiful object , give me lots and lots of money for it . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend in tow , Agnes came breezing in , radiating good will . When she spotted Martin her eyes brightened , and too late he realized what interpretation she would undoubtedly put on his presence . But , surprisingly , she held her fire for the moment , and introduced him simply as a dear , dear friend ? though of course she could not refrain from mentioning Grace and her recent death . Her friend , Mrs. Hudderfield , was a plump , - short woman wearing a grey business-suit and a fur-piece of a manginess which only the very wealthy can afford . She had small eyes and a small mouth , and a very loud , positive Texan voice . Martin would have felt sorry for Mr. Hudderfield , except that Mr. Hudderfield was doubtless a Texan too . " I just had to bring Lizzie over here to see your work , " Agnes told Sally . " She 's so interested in . . . well , in modem art . " " In everything modem , " announced Mrs. Hudderfield . " We do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a big , vital country , and we 're only interested in what is alive and vital . " She looked doubtfully at Sally , as though uncertain of the girl 's vitality . " Well , why do n't you bring some of your things over here by the window where there 's more light . I 'm particularly fond of modem pottery . " Agnes drifted over to where Martin sat . " Are you particularly fond of modern pottery , too ? " she asked . " Or just of the potter ? " " I 'm here to give Sally moral support when she tries to explain that she never sells stuff herself , " Martin said . " Oh , I do n't think Lizzie will want to buy anything . She 's filthy with money , but she hates to spend it . I suspect she 's  | staying with me just to avoid paying a hotel bill . " Mrs. Hudderfield was examining the coquettish colt , now glazed a rich , deep red . " This is a very pretty horse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has no roots at all . " " No roots ? " Sally asked faintly . " I am not one of those people , " Mrs. Hudderfield declared , " who think that something is good just because it 's modern . That is every bit as foolish as thinking that a painting is good just because the painter has been dead for three hundred years . Do n't you think so , Mr. Pryor ? " " Well , yes , " Martin said , but only because he could think of no rational way to disagree . " After all , " continued Mrs. Hudderfield in forcefully reasonable tones , " everything that is made today is modern in a sense . But to be worthwhile , a work of modern art must have more than modern feeling behind it  --  it must have cultural roots as well . " " But I thought out in the Southwest you disapproved of traditions , " Martin said . " Traditions are the dead branches of the tree , " Mrs. Hudderfield explained . " Roots are what keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my husband and I have spent the last few summers in Santa Fe and Taos . Have you ever been to New Mexico , my dear ? " she asked Sally . " No , " said Sally . " Perhaps you should go . Such enchanting art colonies ; the atmosphere is positively vibrant with creativity . The work is so modern , so vital ! And do you know why , my dear ? Because the artists there have so many cultural roots they can draw strength from . The Spanish . . . the Indian . . . . And the American too , of course . There 's one young potter there whose work would interest you , I know . He takes his designs  | from the old Indian sand-paintings , but he modernizes them by ? " Martin drew Agnes over to the door , ostensibly for a cigarette . " Has she always been like this ? " he murmured . " Lord , no . I have n't seen her in twenty years , but she was my best friend at finishing-school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Maplewood , but then she married a Texan and went native . I 'd pity her husband , except that every time he digs a divot , oil gushes out . She 's shown me twenty-seven pictures of him , and in every one of them he 's wearing a Stetson . They have three children , and the children all wear Stetsons too . " " She 's really something , " Martin said almost admiringly . " Is n't she a terror ? " Agnes agreed happily . " She 's going up to Boston tomorrow , but she 'll be back the end of next week . I 'm taking her to the Frobishers ' cocktail party . " And she looked up at him mischievously . Underneath Agnes 's mop of dyed red hair was a face that was easily subject to misinterpretation . Her brow was wide and clear , and her wide-set , dark brown eyes gave an immediate impression of candor and intelligence . It took a better acquaintance to understand that the intelligence had expended itself in futility , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so often grinning  --  surely there was humor there , and a lot of it ? Well , in a sense there was , but in Agnes humor was anything but a saving grace . When he first came to Alden Park , even before he met her , Martin had heard a great deal about Agnes . The women were frankly terrified of her . They exchanged stories about her ( " She told Dr. Finletter right to his face that the Song of  | Songs was a sex education in itself ! " ) not in the manner of doting parents recounting the outrages of their en f ants terribles , but rather as condemned prisoners might relate the past exploits of the public executioner . After he had seen Agnes in action a few times , Martin could appreciate their attitude . Convention , propriety , even simple good manners  --  none of these meant a thing to Agnes . She spoke out whatever came into her mind , and her wit was sufficient that whatever came into her mind was likely to be outrageous by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion that here was a true individual , an original mind , someone worth cultivating . In a community where predictability was valued for its comfort , and people exhibited their individuality , if any , only in their dress , Agnes appeared a personality , and Martin rejoiced in her . Only gradually had he discovered , through the absence of any consistency in Agnes 's attitudes , that his first impression of her had been wrong . The shocks she gave were not byproducts of original thinking , but deliberately calculated effects . Yet there was no malice in her . It would have been easy to say ( and many did say ) that she outraged for the sake of being outrageous , yet that was not true . Her intent was essentially innocent . She aimed at humor ; that she missed was primarily the fault of her up-bringing . Agnes was just a certain type of spoiled brat who had been allowed to grow up without the brattiness ever having been jarred out of her . In early girlhood she had stumbled on a shock-technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worse , vastly amused those adults who encountered it . Thus encouraged , the technique faded into a habit  --  almost a reflex action  --  and in time acquired the stature and standing of an eccentricity . But what can seem funny in the mouth of a dewy adolescent  | is frequently tiresome or worse when it comes from an adult , and as her audiences showed less and less enthusiasm , Agnes unconsciously strove to refine the formula which had served her so well , honing her wit and enlarging her outrages  --  and never entirely understanding why she was n't the popular figure she once had been . Considered in this light , Agnes was an object of pity , and whenever he had all his patience about him , as he did this afternoon , Martin tried to be as nice as possible . So he refrained from commenting on the now obvious fact that Agnes had inflicted Mrs. Hudderfield on Sally only for the selfish reason of sharing her misery . Instead , he considered the problem of how to come to Sally 's rescue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interruption , but her expansive gestures gave Martin an idea . lie suddenly shouted " Careful ! " and plunged across the studio to snatch up a vase which had stood in no danger of being knocked over . Mrs. Hudderfield was properly startled , and murmured with vague apology that she 'd had no idea . Martin fondled the vase and smiled with gentle reproach . " I expect that coming from Texas it 's difficult to remember how cramped we are here in the East , " he said , and then , as Agnes glared at him , wondered if he 'd gone too far . But Mrs. Hudderfield , doubtless brooding over the thought of having to pay for anything she broke , just nodded absently and said that she did get carried away sometimes . Then she pulled herself together , and said , " Well , Aggie , I do n't think we should keep this child from her work any longer . " She thanked Sally effusively for having let them barge in , told her firmly that her work was very sweet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out to Santa Fe some time . Then the two women left . Mrs. Hudderfield 's voice trailed  | behind them : " I did like the head of that nigger , but the lips were much too thin . . . . " Chuckling , Martin turned to find that Sally was distinctly not amused . " That was n't nice , " she told him . Martin gaped at her in astonishment . " But she 'd have bored you silly if I 'd let her rattle on indefinitely . " " I know , " Sally said . " She 's an idiot . But she meant well . " " So did I , for that matter . " " Of course you did ! " Sally exclaimed ruefully . " You were a darling to come , and you really were a great help . I 'm just up-set at having my schedule knocked into a cocked hat . " She patted his arm . " Now be a perfect angel and run along and let me see what I can do to retrieve it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was unusual . Day-dreaming had formerly been one of his major pastimes . In his latter days in New York , when he had been living on the ragged edge of what he considered adequate comfort , many of his happiest hours had been spent conjuring up pictures of the way he would like to live . And though the dreams had gradually taken a somewhat different direction , the habit had persisted into his married life . But since the murder he had discovered that any reverie tended to slither imperceptibly into speculation about the interesting old problem of the immortality of the soul . In killing Grace , had he utterly extinguished her ego , or had some part of it survived as a soul ? Did she , in other words , realize that she had been murdered , and by whom ? If so , there was the possibility ( for by no stretch of the imagination could Martin accept the existence of a Hell ) that he might encounter her in some future life . Martin had made one attempt to visualize that scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrewarding .  | Nowadays , however , the temptation to day-dream about Sally had become irresistible , and Martin yielded cheerfully , although he soon discovered that Grace intruded upon these reveries with tactless persistence . Grace 's effortless , though unsummoned , appearances had made him realize that in one sense at least she had surely survived : as long as he lived she would have an entity of sorts within his mind . On the last occasion , when Martin had been imaginarily baring his complex self to Sally 's understanding , and Grace had intruded , he had amused himself by comparing the two women , seeking the one detail that epitomized the contrast . Physically they were of opposite types , of course , but Martin had made love to enough women in his life to be relatively indifferent to the gulf between Grace 's dark homeliness and Sally 's blonde beauty . There was a more pertinent difference in their bodies  --  Grace 's voluptuous curves ; Sally 's slender boyishness  --  because Sally 's body was somehow the more feminine for being the less female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally settled . Grace had been very proud of her hands , which in truth had been lovely : small and pink and delicate , with carefully tended , painted , pointed nails . Whereas Sally 's hands were broad , with blunt , knuckly fingers and nails bitten down to the quick . It had pleased him to contrast Grace 's strongest point with Sally 's weakest  --  for Sally 's hands were deft and competent and gentle , whereas Grace 's had been soft and futile and quite without character . On this particular afternoon , when Martin would have devoted a reverie to Sally , Grace came instead . It was really quite maddening : was there no being rid of her ? " Why do you waste so much of your time thinking about Sally ? " Grace wondered . " She quite disapproves of you , you know . " " I know , " Martin replied .  | " I never disapproved of you . I was perfectly satisfied to take you as you were . But Sally is n't . " " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the importance of a man 's amounting to something in the world . I do n't , so naturally Sally disapproves of me . " " That 's not the only reason , " Grace pointed out . " Very well , it is n't . She thinks me frivolous and rather cruel , and disapproves of both those attributes in me . Quite properly . But despite that  --  or , possibly , to a certain extent because of that  --  she is attracted by me . " " You 're not sure of that . " " Not absolutely , no . But with my experience , I 'm not likely to be mistaken . She is attracted by me ; I 'm almost positive of it . And that 's what counts , after all . " " Not necessarily , " Grace replied . " I 'll bet I was a lot better in bed than she could ever hope to be . " " You were n't all that wonderful , " Martin told her . " You never found out that there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suspect that you 're quite mistaken . " " Flat-chested little thing . " " There you are mistaken . Besides , that has nothing to do with it . You big-bosomed women are always prone to assume that there 's some connection between sexuality and sheer mammary capacity . It just is n't so . " " And look at the way she walks . She 's as flatfooted as any man . " If you 'd ever come down from those four-inch heels you 'd have walked exactly the same way , except that your behind would have jiggled more just because it was a lot bigger . " Grace ignored his rudeness just as in life she had always ignored his rudenesses  --  as a way to avoid scenes which she considered a waste of nervous energy . " You 've just been  | leading a celibate life ever since . . . well , for the last four months , and Sally is the only half-way attractive unattached girl around . So you find all sorts of qualities in her that really are n't there at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of hell if you 're ever such a fool as to make a pass at her . " " I 'm not so sure . As I was forced to remind you altogether too often , a person as conscious of his vanity as I am is n't too apt to be deluded by it . I am not credulous in believing Sally is fond of me , nor vain in inferring , from the rapidity with which that fondness appeared , that she is attracted by me . After all , however unpleasant you may think me underneath , you know perfectly well that I am not unattractive . " " Too well , " said Grace . " When I say that I know there is passion in her , I am as sure of it as when I knew the same of you , and I have no less confidence in my ability to evoke that passion . That superficial placidity of Sally 's is sitting on top of a smouldering temperament , and there is sensuality in every line of her face . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any man could ask for . Anyway , I have every intention of finding out personally whether I 'm right . " " Blackguard , " Grace said unemotionally . Usually it was difficult to separate Sally from her work in the daytime , but , as it happened , Martin was lucky . She had just finished firing , and had nothing to do till the kiln cooled down in its own good time . And she would love to drive down to Philadelphia with him  --  especially if he would help her find a good art-supply store . Undeniably it was a dull drive and much pleasanter with company . He found her store , attended to his own business and then picked her up and took her to lunch at The Bellevue . They found a movie they both wanted to see in the neighborhood ,  | so it was late afternoon when they left the city , and the heavy traffic slowed them down . At Martin 's suggestion they stopped for dinner at a good roadhouse some distance short of Alden Park . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , one end of which was a dance floor . There was also a small , dim , secluded dining - room , but at Sally 's suggestion they took a table in the main room . Martin was uncertain whether this indicated a preference for the chaperoning public eye , or simply a desire to dance . They had cocktails , several of them , and Sally began to glow appreciably . With their insubstantial dinner , Martin expansively insisted on a bottle of wine , and later brandy with their coffee . And in the midst of all this he realized with amusement ( though he did not then pause to analyze the matter ) that his expansiveness was animated not merely by an innocent curiosity to see what Sally was like when she was a little tight . After dinner they danced . To Grace , dancing had been a social exercise , to which she had brought all the competence of one who had attended dancing-school as a matter of course , and all the lack of verve of one with no instinctive sense of rhythm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin , to whom dancing had once been a major joy , had given up asking her , and had come to think that in any pleasurable sense his dancing days were over . Sally instantly dispelled that attitude . She was the perfect partner , following so lightly and easily that she seemed to spur on his own enthusiasm . He found himself trying more and more complicated steps , and even a few dips  --  oldfashioned now , but still so satisfying to execute . When they returned to their table he was puffing slightly , but feeling  | absurdly pleased with himself . Without consulting Sally , he ordered scotch-and-water for them both . She was already obviously feeling the effects of the alcohol : she was a little flushed , a little more talkative than usual , and just the least little bit kittenish , though in a thoroughly attractive way . She had never seemed so appealing , and Martin unimpatiently savored his desire for her . In a few hours he would take her home  --  and now his eyes and his imagination dreamily anticipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he had ordered the second round of highballs that he suddenly began to understand the implications of the fact that he had been trying , semi-unconsciously , to get Sally tight . For this was most unlike him . He was not one to take any pleasure in making love to half-drunken women . The few occasions when something of the sort had taken place had been so distasteful that Martin had restricted himself to the most abstemious of seductions . Yet here he was feverishly plying Sally with liquor , just like any unimaginative businessman on the make ! And now that Martin had paused to examine this curiosity , he soon realized to his horror that he was , for the first time in as far back as he could remember , wildly unsure of himself . The cause , when he came to look for it , was not difficult to discover : this was a direct result of the seven years of his marriage to Grace . When he had come to see that he was not in love with Grace , and had determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there had been one law that he had created for himself . Or not so much a law , perhaps , as a point of honor . And this was that whatever extra-marital dalliance he might get involved in must be entirely divorced from Grace 's social circle .  | If he 'd loved her , then it would have been different . If he 'd really been deeply in love with Grace then he might have had a casual affair with one of her friends without it having meant a thing , even if Grace had found out about it . Because loving her would have reduced the affair to the status of an itinerant passion , and accordingly meaningless . But not loving Grace , yet enjoying the benefits of her income , put him in her debt  --  a debt which he could repay only by seeing to it that under no circumstances did he damage Grace 's social standing by letting it become known that her marriage was n't of the happiest . As matters had stood , a casual affair which had become known would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honor , which Martin had observed scrupulously , had had the result of sending him , for the first time in his life , to girls who made a profession of their sex . Through an acquaintance of his bachelor days he had located a discreet procuress in the city , and had confined his adventurings to the young ladies she provided . But now Martin apprehended that this course of action , which had seemed so logical when he first embarked upon it , had certain unforeseen disadvantages . For seven years he had made love only to women whose willingness to go to bed with him could be taken for granted in advance . Not once in all that time had he been in a situation where the outcome was doubtful ; not once had he offered a caress which stood a chance of being rebuffed . And his point of view had altered . There had been a time when the first tentative approaches to a romance had been a challenge and an excitement ; when uncertainty had been an added spice . This was true no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of exposing himself to the humiliation of being refused , was anything but appealing .  | Martin rarely thought of how old he was but now , quite abruptly , he acknowledged middle age . The joy in taking chances was gone ; the love of security had set in . This was natural enough , of course . But now that he understood it , he despised this yearning for security for having tried crudely to insure Sally 's compliance by liquor . This was simple cowardice , and he refused to give in to it . Accordingly , in that instant of self-understanding , Martin revised all his plans for the evening . When , in the future , a suitable occasion presented itself , he would risk a rebuff . But he would never , for the sake of his own self-respect , risk the suspicion that Sally had let him make love to her just because she had had too much to drink . So in due course he paid the check and took her home . He saw her to her door like a goddamn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then drove home . On the way it struck him as terribly funny that an uxoricide should have such delicate scruples  --  and his laughter , perhaps because he himself was not entirely unaffected by the liquor , was just a bit hysterical .  | It was Martin 's dearest belief that although he might make occasional errors of judgment he never made stupid mistakes . Therefore it came as a particularly nasty shock when he discovered that he had made a very stupid one . In his relief at finding how much less incriminating the photographs were than he had feared , he had unthinkingly thrown out the envelope which had contained the blackmailer 's second letter , and he had never even glanced at the postmark . It had not occurred to him that there might be anything to learn from it . . . until now . October was nearly over , and that meant that colleges had been in session for over a month . During the academic year it was Benson 's practice to drive to college each Monday morning . He kept very modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had no duties after noon on Thursday , when he invariably drove back to Alden Park for a long weekend . Obviously , if the fetter had been mailed locally on either a Tuesday or a Wednesday , it was at least most unlikely that Benson had mailed it . And now Martin would never know . Although perfectly aware that it was most improbable that  | the postmark would have revealed anything , Martain brooded greatly about his error . For some time now he had been conscious of the strain of his position , and this mistake seemed proof of the extent to which it had affected him . He had already lost weight , and now he was committing stupidities . All his adult life he had aimed at , and striven towards , a tranquilly comfortable and self-sufficient existence , and it still was as elusive as ever . He had glimpsed it in the two months between Grace 's death and the arrival of the first letter . But since then , life had been sheer hell . Except for Sally , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when he could n't afford to be distracted . He had been in a constant turmoil of confused emotions , and for someone who preferred his emotions tidy and under good control nothing could be more unpleasant . For one thing , he had come to hate Alden Park , and the essential irrationality of this emotion made it no easier to bear . He was morally certain that the blackmailer was one of his handful of suspects  --  so why did he regard his other neighbors with a faint suspicion and distrust that made him uneasy with all but the richest and dreariest of them ? The truth was that the existence of the blackmailer had forced him to think like a murderer again , instead of the contented widower he had wanted to be and expected to be . What had been simply consciousness of success had been transformed into consciousness of guilt and awareness of danger . Instinctively he examined innocent remarks for implications that were n't there ; instinctively he weighed his own every utterance to make sure of its innocuousness . This wasteful sharpening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every fatuousness , that he had become irascible . But there was no escaping into unsociability when kindly idiots credited him with excessive grief and strove all the harder to " keep him from brooding . "  | And to an extent their impulse was right , for left to himself he tended more and more to slip into fits of depression because he seemed to be getting no closer to the solution of his problem . Yet if extraneous company was a strain , that was nothing compared to the agonized concentration which he brought to each encounter with a real suspect ( except Sally , of course ) , and which left him quite exhausted afterwards . The strain was telling . Even his simplest pleasures had lost much of their savor . Absentmindedness had done dreadful things to his bridge , and nervousness had so affected his golf that instead of enjoying the course he fought his way around it . In short , he was getting disgustingly little enjoyment out of life . In one of his fits of depression he had even seriously wondered if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might not be being punished for his crime  --  a line of thought that would have thrown him into a spasm of sophisticated laughter just a few months before . Even now he could sneer away the idea as one that his father would have expounded with solemn piety . . . but it shook him more than a little to be reminded of his father in such a connection . When he had first started the game of hunt-the-blackmailer ( which was to have been merely a stimulating puzzle ) Martin had urged haste on himself because of the possibility that some accident might befall the blackmailer , and the incriminating evidence come into other hands . Since he had seen the photographs he had forgotten this fear , yet the need for haste had not lessened . If anything , it had increased , since he had already reached the point of committing stupid blunders . Just two months of pressure had had this effect ; what would it be like if it went on indefinitely , year after year ? With good reason , Martin refrained from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered from fits of depression .  | At various stages of his adolescence Martin had had various ways of accounting for his father , each of them depending on what he had been studying most recently , and each of them critical . There was heredity . Before the generation of Martin 's worldlywise grandfather , the Governor , the Pryors had mostly inclined towards the Methodist ministry . The Governor 's own father , sternest of the lot , had rejoiced in the nickname of " Perdition " Pryor . For some time Martin had believed that these religious leanings must have skipped a generation , and his father was a frustrated minister . Then elementary psychology had offered a theory . Of the Governor 's three sons , Benjamin , Martin 's father , was by several years the eldest and by several inches the shortest . Actually he was somewhat shy of the five feet six inches he had claimed . Martin , who had surpassed his father 's height before he was twelve , had decided that his father had compensated for being shorter than everyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ righteous . And then , slightly more advanced psychology . Martin 's mother had been on the sickly side ; he 'd suspected that she was frigid , and that his father , disappointed in his own sex life , had determined that all pleasure was essentially wicked . But whatever the cause , Benjamin Pryor had unquestionably been a small , solemn , and righteous man . Perhaps he had not really objected to people enjoying themselves , as Martin had sometimes believed , but he certainly had regarded life as a serious matter . To him , the greatest virtue of them all was work . He had judged his fellow-men by their eagerness to do " an honest day 's work , " and he had never tired of the fable of the frivolous grasshopper and the industrious ant . Although he had tried conscientiously to be humble in the sight of the Lord , he could not help preening himself  | with some frequency over the fact that in his entire career he had missed only four days at the office . That office was in Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very dignified firm of stockbrokers . Neither that smallness nor that dignity had been of any help when the bottom had fallen out of the market in Twenty-nine . Martin 's sophomore year at college had been rudely interrupted when he had been summoned home to attend his father 's funeral . The overdose of sleeping-pills which had occasioned this sad event was called an accident only because the coroner , who was also the family doctor , somehow contrived to overlook the rather incoherent note which Benjamin had left behind for his family . In this note he had tried vaguely to make his suicide into an act of noble self-sacrifice , as though his insurance made him more valuable dead than alive . But since their position was n't so desperate on the one hand , nor the insurance so great on the other , Martin had n't believed a word of it . It had seemed much more likely that his father , in one of his fits of depression , had not been able to face living in a world where the puritan virtues by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amply provided for ( his grandmother 's fortune having been divided among the grandchildren ) , the lawyer advised Mrs. Pryor to purchase an annuity with the insurance and the remainder of the estate , and Martin had returned to college . For the benefit of his classmates he had manifested a modest grief , but his only sincere reaction was relief at the realization that now he would n't have to take another tedious job during the coming summer vacation . But the real effect of his father 's death had n't become apparent until somewhat more than a year later when he came of age , and into possession of an income of over six thousand dollars a year . Despite Martin 's rebelliousness , Benjamin  | Pryor had always maintained a strong moral ascendency over his son . Martin 's cerebral dexterity might produce the cleverer arguments , but his father had had access to truths that were superior to logic . Sometimes Martin had gotten his own way against his father 's wishes , but he had always been made to feel guilty about it , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not left his inheritance in his father 's hands , for the income to be reinvested . As it was , he was his own master , free to do as he chose  --  he had bought a car . And then an elegant wardrobe . And then had had to scrimp for the rest of the year to make up for the extravagance . The scrimping had affected his thoughts in his senior year , much of which he had spent in the approved fashion of deciding what he would do with his life , though the conclusions he came to would have been approved by nobody . These conclusions had been arrived at easily enough ; the difficulty had been in justifying them . It had been necessary to convince himself that the philosophy he was evolving for himself was no longer a reaction from his father , but the inevitable consequence of his intellect , temperament . . . and independent income . This personal philosophy was founded on his complete noninterest in work of any sort . The conventional view  --  which his father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defect in Martin 's character , but Martin had never been willing to accept any conventional view without a struggle . Why should a man work if he did n't have to ? Obviously because idleness harmed him , and broadly speaking this was undoubtedly true . The average man lacked the capacity to support idleness , the stability to withstand its temptations , and the resources to offset its stagnation . Looked at that way , the puritan hatred of idleness was based on sheer envy of a state which most people could n't enjoy .  | It was most satisfactory to have this worked out for once and all , and Martin never thought of the matter again . Obviously the incapacities of the average man did n't apply to him . So when he graduated from college Martin went to live in New York City as the best spot for an existence of cultivated leisure . Quite as he had expected , the time passed easily and pleasantly , and he had rarely been bored . Apart from a conviction that a good address was a necessity instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than sybaritic , and his income , in those days of lower taxes , would have sufficed if it had not been for his main hobby , which was women . Calling women a " hobby " was not really a flippancy on Martin 's part : he had collected love affairs as a pastime as other men collect bookbindings or antique watches  --  knowledgeably , artistically , and tenderly . He rarely troubled to get emotionally involved , but unless he did he was scrupulously careful to make sure that the lady remained as fancy-free as he . It spoke well for his finesse that ( with one harrowing exception ) he had never parted from a love on any but the very best of terms . But if this was the most exquisite of hobbies , as Martin believed , it was also horribly expensive . New York was undoubtedly full of girls of simple tastes , but in the circles Martin frequented at that time he had encountered few of them . Although he specialized in restaurants that had not yet been discovered , and nightclubs that offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were enormous . Fortunately , his mother was both indulgent and generous . As is so often the case , widowhood had greatly improved Mrs. Pryor 's health , and she seemed to enjoy the last decade of her life much more than she had enjoyed the previous five . Martin was always a welcome guest , and he was not ashamed to  | impose upon her hospitality whenever his squiring about of some prospective mistress had reduced him to the alternatives of delaying his rent or going hungry for a couple of weeks . Moreover , he played bridge for quite high stakes . He could usually count on this for pin-money of twenty-five a week or thereabouts , but occasionally there had been catastrophes at just the wrong time , and his mother had bailed him out to the tune of a couple of hundred each time . Even then there had been embarrassments . Several times he had had to borrow from his mistresses , and one of the conveniences of running with a wealthy set  --  one that he hardly could afford , really  --  was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It need hardly be said that Martin had always scrupulously paid back every cent , but it might be noted that a girl who had helped him out never remained his mistress much longer . Martin was proud in those days , or at least rather prouder than he later became . He was proud enough that when he met people whom he wanted to like him , and who would have disapproved of his idleness if they 'd known of it , he had saved their feelings ( and his ) by inventing purposeful projects which supposedly occupied him . Occasionally he even lived up to them for a while . Is biography of his grandfather dated from this era , though all he had to show for his work at that time was one small notebook full of illegible notes . He 'd served on various charitable and philanthropic committees . And for a while he composed tunes for the suggestive and theoretically sophisticated songs of a friend of his who knew and supplied a night-club singer of such ditties . Then , just about the time the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died , and of course that source of income died with her . A punctured ear-drum had kept Martin out of the army , for which he was grateful at first ,  | though less so later on . The ladies were interested only in uniforms , and besides , soldiers were able to spend so much more heavily than he . Finances were becoming an increasing consideration . In fact , in time his income shrank to such a point that he had to choose among four distasteful alternatives . He could give up sex altogether , but that seemed drastic ; he could move to a cheaper apartment , but they were n't to be found any more ; he could get married , but he could n't possibly afford that unless his wife had an income at least as large as his ; or he could give up running with a crowd that was actually much too expensive for him . He had known for some time that this retrenchment was coming , and had tried to delay it with small economies  --  till a disastrous run of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no gulf between the social set Martin left and the upper-class bohemia he entered ; actually they overlapped quite a bit . By then fully a third of his friends had fallen under the latter classification , so the mechanics of the alteration was simply a matter of concentrating on this minority . But the shift in viewpoint , which was the only real difference between the two groups apart from the economic pace , had not been to Martin 's taste . He had moved from conventional elegance to equally conventional informality , from gaiety to earnestness . Catholic in his tastes , he had taken in stride the change from musical comedy to reproving drama , ballet to modern dance , French chanteuse to guitarstrumming balladeer . But he lamented the intense intellectualism which discounted his polished wit , and deeply resented the standard of manners which permitted any young upstart to make fun of his opinions or even contradict him to his face . Still , on the whole , life continued pleasant , though as prices and taxes continued to rise he had had to economize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this period it had occurred to him to wonder why he had not married back in the days when an advantageous match would have been easy to achieve . Of course it would have meant an end to his womanizing , but one could always sacrifice a hobby for the comfortable life . But when he 'd looked back , he had found that in none of the few occasions when he had become emotionally involved had the girl had any money to speak of . And he could never have married solely , or even primarily , for money : playing the gigolo , as he had inadvertently proved , was just another form of work , an exceptionally repugnant one at that . No , money was simply one of a girl 's attractions , and though in his position at that time no girl could have been marriageable without it , love in some degree or other would have had to be present . Though he had undeniably been on the look-out for well-to-do girls when he had met Grace , that marriage had still been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her money had been only one of the emotions involved . Still , it was now pleasant to realize that if he should ever want to marry again  --  not that he was contemplating the idea , even remotely  --  he would be able to consult his emotions alone , without worrying about expediency . " You have such lovely hair , " Martin observed . " Why , thank you , " Sally said , and he felt a fleeting annoyance at the fact that , like most American women , she knew of no better way to cope with a compliment than by formal gratitude . But the atmosphere was an auspicious one , and Martin could n't be bothered with irrelevant irritations . He had dropped in at the studio late in the afternoon , and had found Sally just cleaning up after a day 's work . She had brought him  | into the house and given him a drink and a magazine to keep him amused while she had a shower . And now , in a long , blue terry-cloth robe , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . It was all very cosy . " I said you have lovely hair , " Martin repeated , " but I did n't exactly mean it as a compliment . " He paused , tantalizingly , expecting some murmur of curiosity or encouragement . But Sally simply watched him with that expression which he had once thought blank , and in which he now saw so much earnestness and so much quiet merriment , canceling each other out to all but the discerning eye . " What I meant was that your hair ca n't help being lovely , despite the fact that you do n't pay it any attention . " " That still sounds like a compliment . " " It is n't , though . I 'm implying that you could be so much lovelier than you already are if you made the slightest effort . But you do n't . " She smiled at him . " Men always want a girl to look her prettiest , and the prettier she looks the less seriously they take her . " " And you insist on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have a living to make , " she reminded him . " Which means that much of the time I 'm too busy to care what I look like . Besides , it 's hard enough for a woman to make herself respected as an artist ; if she 's attractive , sex just gets in the way to make it harder . " " I suppose that 's true , " Martin admitted , thinking that it would be a poor man indeed who could see Sally as she was now and keep his mind on ceramics . The robe was becoming , and , as far as Martin could tell , she did n't have on a thing underneath it . This costume , or rather its deficiency , gave the whole situation a familiar , almost hackneyed , quality , and  | made Martin feel full of confidence and very much at his ease . " But it 's after working hours , " he continued , " and I 'm not one of your customers . You know how much I admire your work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you as a woman first , and an artist distinctly second . " " And thinking of me as a woman , you wish I 'd go and put on some lipstick , " Sally grinned at him . " Not just now , " he replied firmly . For an instant she seemed uncertain ; then she stood up . " Let me get you another drink , " she said , reaching for his glass . He put the glass aside instead , pulled her easily into his lap , and kissed her . Her lips firmed to an immediate response , and he hugged her to him tightly , wondering that he had ever been such a fool as to be unsure of her . He closed his eyes , the better to enjoy the delicate sensuality of unfamiliar kisses , and the fresh scent of her just-washed body filled his nostrils . His hands lightly fondled her shoulders , slid over the fine , silky hair , touched at the nape of her neck . He kissed her ever more deeply , and he could feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then , in his exuberance , he made the mistake of attempting to proceed too rapidly . It was a moment before she reacted , but Martin sensed his error and tried to rectify it with the tenderest , most innocent of caresses . Yet she went quite passive in his arms and said quietly , tritely , " No , Martin . Let me go . " He was still confident , from the quickness of her response to his kisses , but perfectly willing to cater to her sense of decorum . So he let her sit up away from him , but held her in his lap , lightly gripping her shoulders . " I 've wanted you so much , " he said gravely . It was offered as a graceful and flattering apology , and he fully expected it to work . But when he  | tried to pull her close to him again she shook her head , and with a quick motion stood up . " I was getting you a drink , " she said with a brisk casualness that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the table that served as a bar . Martin was still convinced that this was just a momentary pique at his crudeness . He followed her , not wanting to let the mood escape too far . Perhaps a more direct apology was in order , so he manfully said , " I 'm sorry , darling , " and kissed her neck . " So am I , " Sally replied , and refused to let him twist her around and into his arms . Confusion and outrage swept over him with the sudden realization that he really was being rebuffed after all . A frustrated fury built up in him till it took every bit of the sophistication and self-control he possessed to keep him from bursting out with some irretrievably damaging snarl . She was acting like a virginal school-girl , and he wanted to tell her so ; wanted to tell her what he thought of a woman who evoked passion , responded to it , and then ran away from it . But he forced himself to keep silent , to walk shakily back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him his drink . And his self-command was rewarded . Either Sally had sensed his turmoil , or she had n't needed to , but now she was obviously feeling guilty . If he 'd assailed her with furious words he would have driven her to the defensive ; as it was , she avoided his gaze . " You have every reason to be angry with me , " she said faintly , " but I hope you are n't . " Martin swigged at his drink until his throat felt relaxed enough to produce a normal voice . " More confused than anything , " he lied . " I do n't blame you . " She seemed uncertain how to go on , and Martin made no effort to help . " Has Bill ever told you anything  | of my background ? " she asked suddenly . " Bill Benson ? " Martin said in surprise , and then remembered the time Bill had nearly exposed some confidence of Sally 's . " No , he has n't . " " He promised he would n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment she lapsed back into silence , and then began again , now looking at him very sweetly and contritely . " Martin , I really am dreadfully sorry . I know I owe you all sorts of explanations , but I simply do n't feel up to going into all of it now . " " Perhaps I ought to run along , " Martin offered politely . " Of course not , " she said . " Finish your drink and try not to be too annoyed with me . I did want you to kiss me , you know . " " You did n't seem to mind , " he said drily . " Oh , I enjoyed it , " she assured him . " And dressed the way I am , and all , there was no way on earth for you to know that I was n't perfectly prepared to leap into bed with you . " Despite himself , Martin could n't help smiling at the complete innocence of this remark . And Sally , glad to see him less stem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged . " I know I handled things very badly , but I 'm not really such a bitch as you must think me now . And I promise you you 'll understand very soon . " As long as he remained , her presence somehow made her hypothetical forthcoming explanations seem satisfactory . But as soon as he left he began to feel angry again , and by the time he reached home he was absolutely furious .  | His anger had not dissipated itself by the next day . Every time he remembered the events of the previous afternoon a fresh wave of resentment swept over him . Against his better judgment he had been lured into dalliance , and then rebuffed ! There simply was no excuse for such a thing . Whatever Sally 's mysterious explanation might be , it could n't possibly be satisfactory . He thought that she was frigid , that she was deformed , that she must be the blackmailer  --  in fact , he did n't know what to think , except that he was in a sour rage of frustration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in this frame of mind that he decided to go into the city , as a way of releasing his pent-up emotions . He had n't been there since Grace 's death ; had n't even thought of going since that morning when the first blackmail letter arrived . The problem which that had posed had kept him pinned to Alden Park with an almost superstitious conviction that if he went away , even overnight , something dreadful might happen . But now the idea of going into New York seemed justifiable , even essential , as a therapeutic measure .  | Then he remembered that this was the day of the Frobisher cocktail party . His first impulse was to skip the party , but he instantly rebelled against giving in to such weakness . He was proud of his self-discipline , was he not ? Well , this was certainly a time to exercise it . Anyone could keep himself in hand when things were going well , but it took an exceptional man to rise above them when they were going badly . He had planned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go he would , even if it was the last thing on earth he wanted to do . Back in the days when he had considered Dennis and his moustache a pair of unnecessary excrescences , they had seemed all too unavoidable . But recently , despite Sally 's attempt to make Dennis and him more friendly , Dennis was rarely to be encountered . He would surely be at the party , however , and Martin had a little trap to spring on him . Accordingly , to the party he would go , and somehow he would put aside this welter of emotions and calmly and craftily spring his trap . He could leave the party by six with any luck at all , and that was time enough to be going into the city . But it was quite maddening to recollect that it was fear of just this sort of situation , where extraneous emotion would interfere with the job of ferreting out the blackmailer , that had made him hesitate about getting involved with Sally . Damn and blast the girl ! A morning of bill-paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was able to devote the early afternoon to a relatively tranquil mental rehearsal of the more intricate part of the forthcoming scene with Dennis . For this trap was of necessity a bold one . If Dennis were the blackmailer he would instantly comprehend what Martin was about , and it must appear that Martin was insinuating that he had found Dennis out ; on the other hand , if Dennis were innocent  | the conversation must seem an innocuous one so that Dennis would have ample opportunity to demonstrate that he was unaware of any overtones . This took a bit of planning , since Martin wanted to be able to deliver his own speeches with an ease which would leave him free to devote all his attention to Dennis 's reactions , if any . But he felt prepared in time to give a leisurely hour to a bath and shave , and the careful choosing of a suit that would be equally appropriate for the party and the trip to town . When he finally set off he was feeling fully nine-tenths in command of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a spirit of duty , he was probably the only guest so animated . This was one of the smaller , or forty-guest parties . The Frobishers gave one enormous party each year , and half a dozen of the smaller sort . There was some mysterious rotation in the guest list for the latter , so they had come to be an index of one 's standing in Alden Park . To be seen at most of them was a sign of distinction ; to be missing from several in succession was evidence of some social crime , such as failure to contribute when Betty Frobisher approached you on behalf of one of her favorite charities . But apart from the arbitrary laws that hedged the invitations , the Frobishers ' parties suffered from no excess of formality , and were usually quite pleasant . Alec and Betty met Martin at the door with their customary little cries of social delight , and waved him in . As always , in one corner of the large hall a bar had been set up , presided over by a whitecoated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of emulatively-inclined hostesses whose husbands boggled at such expense on the grounds that his cocktails were n't a damn ' bit better than those of the local caterer . The bartender asked Martin 's fancy , and he chose a scotch sour . He did n't like scotch sours , thinking them an unfriendly way  | to treat good scotch , so he could be confident of not drinking it too quickly . Glass in hand , he paused at the top of the three steps that led down into the vast , airy living-room . There was no sign of Sally 's sleek blonde head , and for the sake of his coolness of mind he was glad . But he was more than a little chagrined to realize that he 'd looked for her first of all , and almost eagerly , at that . At the foot of the steps was Mrs. Hudderfield , talking animatedly to Gerald Marshall . Evidently her thoughtfulness in explaining ceramics to Sally had not been an aberration but a normal effusion of her personality , for she was telling Gerald all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety , and one could n't really appreciate what a challenging game golf was until one had played there . Martin strolled through the room , exchanging smiles of greeting with those who had one eye cocked for newcomers . Mrs. Mitchell broke off a monologue on herbaceous borders to pat him on the arm and tell him how much she missed Grace at the Garden Club meetings . Martin summoned up a wistful smile , and moved on . Wally Herndon had backed Dr. Finletter into the far corner , and was telling him with unusual heat : " Just listen to this and tell me if you 've ever heard anything more idiotic . My partner opened with one spade , and I held six clubs to the king , four hearts to the ace . . . " In the library beyond , Martin found Dennis Morley and Agnes talking all by themselves ; the party was not yet large enough for any more of an overflow . He braced himself , and joined them . " She was telling Alex all about how to make money on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lizzie Hudderfield , " Agnes explained unnecessarily to Martin .  | " I can imagine , " he said . " Just now she was telling Gerald all about golf . " " She 's so wonderfully predictable , " Agnes said happily . " Of course , I made a point of telling her that Gerald is our local champion . " Agnes 's presence posed a problem . A complete outsider would n't have mattered , but a second suspect would multiply his difficulties . If she did n't leave of her own accord , it would soon be necessary to drive her away , but for the moment Martin could see a way to put her to use . So he waited until the subject of Mrs. Hudderfield was exhausted and then told Agnes that he had another detective novel that she would enjoy . She was delighted . She counted on small economies , like cheap liquor in the punch-bowl or borrowing books instead of buying or renting them , to balance her extravagances in other directions . Martin allowed her no chance to enlarge on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turn that might bore him . " I do n't suppose you 've acquired the taste yet , " Martin said provocatively to Dennis . Dennis had not , most emphatically . Martin had heard him on the subject before , so it was no trick to get him to repeat his opinion that detective fiction was unrealistic , inartistic and unimaginative . Martin encouraged him to expand these views . Just as he had hoped , Agnes soon lost interest in hearing her favorite form of reading-matter ridiculed . Her attention strayed ; through the open door she spotted someone who promised to be more entertaining , and she darted away , leaving the two men alone . " I admit there 's a great deal in what you say , " Martin broke in promptly in a tone that implied that what Dennis had said  | was both obvious and beside the point , " but I think you go too far when you say they 're unimaginative . " " Oh , I know many people think they 're most ingenious , " Dennis said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , lots of them are just stupid , and I suspect that the only ones you 've read were like that . But some of them can be devilishly clever . For example , I was reading one the other evening that centered around a little puzzle that stumped me completely , and I 'll wager it would have stumped you , too . " " Some tricky horror involving a corpse in a locked room ? " Dennis asked contemptuously . " No , nothing of the kind . It was quite a homely sort of problem  --  the type of thing you would n't expect to be much of a problem at all , but almost unsolvable once you really started to think about it . " Dennis succumbed . " What was it ? " he asked , obviously determined to solve the riddle or prove that the author 's solution had been ridiculous . Martin took a deep breath and launched into his carefully prepared speech . " Well , the background does n't matter  --  it was a sort of spy story with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very plausible , I 'll admit . But the problem was straightforward enough . The hero had to have one of the villains deliver a package to him in such a fashion that the villain could n't possible discover to whom he was delivering it . This happened in a small town , and I thought of it in terms of Alden Park . Do you see the idea ? How could I , for example , in a small place like this , have you get a package to me without there being a chance of your finding out who I am ? Quite a neat little puzzle , is n't it ? " And he looked at Dennis with an expression , patiently rehearsed in front of a mirror , that might be taken for either defiance or insinuation.  | Twice the blackmailer had indicated he was finding it difficult to think of a safe way to collect the price of his silence , and Martin , having given the matter some thought , could appreciate the problem . If Dennis could solve it , that in itself would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he reacted to the problem . And Dennis 's expression showed only a calmly competitive concentration . " Oh , I do n't know , " he said after a moment . " It does n't seem as difficult as you make out . " And he proceeded to tackle the problem , thinking out loud as he went . Despite his dislike of the man , Martin could n't help being impressed by the speed with which Dennis organized his thinking . In a moment he had sketched out the various hazards that would have to be coped with , and then went on to examine different possibilities . The first three he dismissed as unsatisfactory on one count or another . He toyed with a fourth ; started to throw it out , and then came up with a twist that made it seem foolproof . A fifth was nearly as good , and the sixth  --  almost an afterthought  --  was devastatingly simple . All this with the air of a lofty intellectual solving a child 's riddle . But he spoiled that effect , and added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiring with ingenuous eagerness which had been the author 's solution . Martin chose the cleverest of Dennis 's solutions and said that was the one the author had used . And then he patiently paid the penalty for having started the argument by listening while Dennis , obviously very pleased with himself , went on to explain condescendingly that writers of such stories started out with some elementary gimmick and then spent the rest of their time trying to make the puzzle seem more complicated than it really was so the reader would be all the more impressed when the author solved it . Martin took no offense at the condescension . The argument had been an artificial one ,  | and had served its purpose admirably . Without a trace of doubt , Dennis was eliminated as a suspect . Surreptitiously Martin glanced at his watch . It was only five o'clock , but , now that he had accomplished what he had come for , the party seemed a dreadful waste of time and he was eager to be on his way . So when he felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , acknowledged defeat on all counts , and admitted that he only read such books to put himself to sleep . And because at the moment he felt only the friendliest feelings toward Dennis , and did n't wish to be thought sarcastic , he brought forth his very nicest smile and actually patted him affectionately on the knee  --  a gesture that he had never in his life employed before , at least to another man . Then he went away , leaving a thoroughly baffled Dennis behind him . As soon as he reentered the living-room he saw that Sally had arrived . There was something different about her , but for a moment he could n't think what it was . Then he realized that her hair was carefully and attractively done , and her make-up was thoughtful instead of slapdash . And she was wearing a new and becoming cocktail-dress . All in all , he thought he had never seen her look so lovely  --  and then it occurred to him that he 'd gotten in the habit of thinking the same thing each time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ruefully , and detached herself from Wally Herndon to join him . " Still mad at me ? " she asked . " Not in the slightest , " he lied , and smiled down at her . " These are new shoes , " she confided , " and they 're doing horrid things to my feet . Ca n't we sit down somewhere ? And later on I 'd like a lift home , even if home is only a few hundred yards away . " For a moment he was shamefully tempted , but he strengthened  | himself with the thought of what awaited him in the city . " I 'm afraid I was just leaving , " he apologized . " I have to run into town . I 'm . . ah . . . going to a party . Some friends are giving it , " he added hastily , as if that detail would make it all more plausible . " I see . " She seemed disappointed . " Look , I know we 're going to the Bensons ' Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before then . Could you drop around to the studio tomorrow , perhaps ? Or during the day on Friday ? " " Probably Friday , " he said . " I 'm staying in town tonight , and I may not be back till late tomorrow . Well , have fun . " But the instant he left her he began to wish that at least he 'd stayed for more of a chat . Mrs. Hudderfield was still by the steps , but her victim now was Dr. Finletter , looking as though he had been trapped within inches of freedom . She was telling him firmly all about God , Who apparently was proud of having created Texas , whatever He might think about the rest of the world . He stopped at a bar along the highway , and had a short straight drink to revive his spirits and clean away the taste of the scotch sour . Then he closed himself into the booth and put in a call to Mrs. Trotter , a lady whom he knew only by her rich , fruity contralto on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parker . " The pseudonym had seemed a reasonable precaution at first , and now he was stuck with it . " Oh , yes , Mr. Parker . I have n't heard from you in quite some time . " " No , I 've been out to the coast on business . " Martin was very proficient at lying to Mrs. Trotter . " I 'm going to be in the city tonight , and I wondered if by any chance Diana were available . "  | " I 'm sorry , Mr. Parker , but Diana is n't with me any more . Her husband was transferred to Chicago . And I 'm afraid that Denise is already engaged for this evening . This is very short notice , you know . " Even in his disappointment , he was impressed . Mrs. Trotter had either a fabulous memory or a businesslike cardfile close to the telephone . " Well , I 'll have to leave it up to you , then . " " Very well , " she said in an amused tone . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent for a moment , leaving Martin to contemplate the thought that Mrs. Trotter probably had a much more attractive personality than most of the young ladies she handled . " Mr. Parker ? The name is Carol Crawford . Do you have that ? " " Yes , " said Martin , who had jotted it down on a pad thoughtfully provided by the telephone company for just such purposes . " Could you have her meet me at the Licorne on East Fifty-fifth at eight o'clock ? " " Certainly , Mr. Parker , " said Mrs. Trotter , and hung up . Martin went back to the bar and had another drink in memory of Diana , and then drove into New York feeling less pleased with the expedition than before . He checked in at the small East Side hotel that knew him as Martin Parker , and gave in to a well-established compulsion by having still another bath . Promptly at ten minutes after eight he arrived at the Licorne , one of the many little French restaurants in New York which can hover for decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the prices would seem to indicate that it already had . The captain , Leon , greeted him with an enthusiasm born of a long line of ten-dollar bills , lamented the interval since M. Parker had last been in , and indicated that M. Parker 's " little friend " had already arrived . Martin 's gaze had been scudding along the bar ; now he followed Leon 's line of sight  | and saw that his guess had been correct : it was the sulky blonde with the long-haired furpiece . Leon rushed away to justify the most recent ten-dollar bill by producing a table for two , and Martin introduced himself to Carol Crawford . The sulkiness vanished instantly , to be replaced by a quick , talkative gaiety . To the extent that she was pleased to find him not bald , fat , or ten years older , the gaiety was probably sincere rather than mechanical . For his part , Martin would have preferred to find Carol ten years older than she looked , which was shockingly young : no more than eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fashion established by the motion pictures : a circular face , with symmetry of feature substituting for character . Unlike Sally , she evidently thought highly of make-up , and used a great deal of it . Her perfectly arched eyebrows were more pencil than hair , her eyes were delicately shadowed , and her lipstick had traced a line rather fuller than nature had provided for . However , if he did n't look too closely , the effect was certainly attractive . Her figure , if he could believe what he saw , was on the spectacular side . There was a noticeable craning of masculine necks as Leon led them to their table . Martin put aside his dismayed reaction to her youth , repressed his dislike of southern accents , and immediately set about trying to establish a personal relationship . He urged her to call him by his given name instead of the " Darlin ' " she seemed disposed to , and talked to her as to a person he wished to make a friend . He had once had an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that charming book had left an impression which influenced all his subsequent dealings with ladies of Fanny 's profession . " Men know not in general , " the sensible Fanny had observed , " how much they destroy of their own pleasure , when they break the respect and tenderness due to our sex , and even to those of it  | who live only by pleasing them . " Martin had thought this eminently logical , and out of the impulses of his own temperament had glossed the need for tenderness as the need for a cordial intimacy , even in a financially motivated relationship . The social aspect of sex was essential to him ; he had to make love to a human being , and not just a willing female body . So he firmly steered her away from her line of chatter , which consisted primarily of a recital of all the nightclubs she had visited in the last fortnight and the celebrities she had spotted in each one , and urged her to talk about herself . As delicately as possible he indicated that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to how she had arrived at her present occupation , but was sincerely interested in her tastes , her amusements , her ambitions . What did she hope to be , for example ? She was going to be a model , it seemed  --  but further examination elicited only that in a few weeks some man was going to take pictures of her , and if they turned out well she would , in some remote future , take them around to the agencies . Martin abandoned that line as unproductive and turned to the theatre : what plays had she seen ? Carol produced a list of the three most popular musical comedies and then stopped short . Evidently she had seen each of them at least four times , and whatever pleasure they might have given her originally had long since escaped her mind . Martin decided against inquiring into her reading habits , and , after having ascertained that she came from North Carolina and had been in New York less than two years , he asked if she liked the city  --  and , if so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake . In no time at all she was back on the nightclubs and the celebrities to be found in them . After dinner she was visibly disappointed when he vetoed  | the more glittering night-spots for one of the more intimate supper clubs which offered good enough entertainment on its diminutive stage that nobody much cared who might be sitting at the next table but one . Martin was sorry to create a hiatus in her lion-hunting , but he had found the conversation tiresome , and felt in the need of outside distraction . Because the evening was going badly , he set out to get tight as quickly as possible . This was not an easy task , since like most of its kind the supper club served as little liquor to each drink as the law allowed , but Martin did his best . Instead of cheering him up , however , the liquor depressed him still further , and he became terribly morose when a girl , who looked enough like Sally to be her sister , came out on the stage and sang bawdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urging on his part , Carol matched him drink for drink , but the liquor seemed to affect her not at all . Somewhere along the line , though , she sensed his mood , and did her best to cheer him up with a kind of heavy-footed , adolescent teasing . There was more kindliness than wit in her efforts , though once she came very near to humor , when she remarked that he had n't once mentioned his wife . " Most of the men do , " she explained . " My wife is dead , " he told her . " Gee , that 's too bad , " she said sympathetically , and a moment later was trying all the harder to amuse him , doubtless assuming that he was a recently bereaved widower . But though Carol 's efforts accomplished little in themselves , they did serve to remind him that he had no right to spoil her evening . He forced himself to brighten up , and set out to entertain her , as he should have done in the first place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her all the funny stories he had heard recently , carefully weeding out the lewder ones because he had long since learned that girls like Carol often had a nice sense of propriety in language . He  | eschewed gossip about theatrical personalities on the probability that she was better informed there than he , but when he found that she knew several of his society friends from the old days , he invented scandalous stories about them . She was an appreciative audience , and things began to go much better . For the first time that evening Martin began to enjoy himself . They stayed through most of the second show , but when the girl who looked like Sally was due to reappear Martin suggested they leave . Carol 's exit created the usual stir of masculine attention , and trailing after her Martin was warmed by the envy he excited . She was a delectable creature , and what the devil was the matter with him ? In the cab he pulled her to him , and fondled her with an almost vicarious hunger . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . There was no reason for him to be disappointed . Even Diana , easily the sexiest trollop he had known , had not responded to his very first caresses until the second time he took her out , and by then she had known of his proficiency in bed . But he was disappointed , and he could n't help comparing Carol 's docility with Sally 's electric and exciting response , brief though it had been . As always , Martin had taken a small suite at the hotel , considering it an indelicacy to usher a woman directly into a bedroom . Carol seemed impressed , and looked around as inquisitively as a puppy while he phoned down for glasses and a pitcher of ice-water ; the bottle of scotch had come with him in his suitcase . But these were just mechanical arrangements , and Martin already knew that it would take more than another few drinks to keep the evening from collapsing into futility . From across the room Carol was a mature , exciting woman . He called her to him , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , and he despaired of ever making her understand that , especially in the  | mood he was in , he needed more from her than just an acquiescent body . This time when he kissed her she seemed more interested , but that her mind was n't really on it was shown by the speed with which she reacted when the bellhop knocked at the door . With practiced silence she vanished into the next room , taking her purse and furpiece with her . When the bellhop left she returned , and now she was obviously more relaxed . She kicked off her pumps and sat down on the couch with her feet tucked under her . The pose was so reminiscent of Sally that Martin , who was mixing the drinks , wanted to fling the bottle of scotch at her head . But he kept his temper , gave Carol her drink , and then picked up her purse . She watched him uncertainly while he took a fiftydollar bill out of his wallet , tucked it in the purse , and then dropped the purse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat in the armchair opposite her . " Look , Carol , " he said . " The purely financial aspect of this evening is over and done with . Do you understand ? " Quite obviously she did n't . " Do n't you want me to stay ? " she asked . " I 'd like you to stay , " he replied , " but that 's entirely up to you now . Your evening had to be paid for , and I 've paid for it . You can pick up your purse and walk out of here any time you like . But if you stay , which I hope you do , it will be solely because you want to . " Yet deep in his heart Martin realized that he was n't even sure that he wanted her to stay . " I just do n't get it , " Carol complained . Then sudden suspicion flared in her face . " Listen , I wo n't stand for being whipped or any fancy stuff like that . I know there 're men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to stand for it , and I wo n't . . . . " Her voice fell before his contemptuous stare . Abruptly her painted face , her dirty , empty mind , her bulbous body , all seemed unbearably coarse and hateful to Martin ,  | and he wanted nothing so much as to be rid of her . Even a Sally who left him shaken with frustration was preferable to the passion of such trash as this , if she had any passion in her . " You 're a very stupid little girl , " he told her coldly . " No , I had no desire to whip you or perform any of the other filthy things you refer to as fancy stuff . ' And now I think you 'd better run along . " " I 'm sorry I said what I did , " she said placatingly . " I guess I did n't understand what you were driving at . " " I guess not , " he agreed . " As I said , you are a very stupid little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me like that , " she snapped , fumbling into her shoes . " Anybody can make a mistake . " " I suppose that 's true , " Martin admitted . He was sick of the whole episode , suddenly bone-weary , and interested in nothing but a soft bed and oblivion . " Just run along , please . " " I can keep the fifty dollars ? " " You may . " " And you wo n't tell Mrs. Trotter that I called you a pervert ? Please do n't do that ! " " I sha n't , " Martin promised , and she was gone . Resolutely he sat in his chair and finished off his drink and Carol 's before he went to the bedroom . In his foggy state it seemed desperately important that he make sure that he would fall asleep the instant his head touched the pillow . He did n't want to lie awake even for a minute with the understanding that , unlike any other woman he had ever known , Sally had somehow destroyed the pleasure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realization that he was deeply , desperately , head-over-heels in love with a girl who showed no sign of being anywhere near that much in love with him .  | Early the following morning Martin drove home in a fashion that showed no consideration for the other drivers on the highway . As the least disturbing line of thought he tried to concentrate on his three remaining suspects , Agnes , Benson and Sally , but he kept ending up thinking just of Sally , and not as a suspect at all . He got into a row with Mrs. Hodges for not having anything in the house for his lunch , and was proved thoroughly in the wrong . Then he puttered aimlessly about the house in a state of sullen impatience until late afternoon , when Benson could be presumed to have returned home from college . And when he went to see Benson , even that was not a visit to a suspect but to someone who knew something of Sally 's mysterious past . He found Benson in a towering rage . In such states Bill fancied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a better description . It was several minutes before Martin could even discover what all the fuss was about . Apparently another of Bill 's scholarly books had just come out , something about The Heritage of Medieval Thought , and a well-meaning friend had sent him a copy of the review that was about to appear in the New York Times . " Of all the mean ,  | underhanded , swinish tricks , this is the worst ! " Benson declared . He popped his spectacles into place and glowered furiously at Martin . " Do you know who they went out of their way to get to review my book ? The eminent historian ' ? that 's what they call him ? ' the eminent historian , Cyril Talbot . ' Do you know who he is ? " Martin admitted that he 'd heard the name . " Of course you have , " Benson roared . " The man has a press agent . He was thrown out of England because he was boring the population to death , but we 've made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd have been nearer the mark if they 'd called him an eminent metaphysician . What little history there is in his books has been twisted out of shape to fit Talbot 's adolescent notions about the historical importance of the religious impulse . " " But do n't you think . . . ? " Martin began . " I think the man 's an ass , " Benson said . " Listen to this . Professor Benson dwells at unnecessary length ? ' Unnecessary length , eh ? That from a man who once devoted sixteen jejune and long-winded chapters to demonstrating that a nation 's geography could have an effect on its history ! " " It seems excessive , " Martin said soothingly . " Do n't you humor me , " Benson snarled . " Listen to this . It is often difficult to tell from his tone whether or not Professor Benson expects us to take his theories seriously . ' Do you know what that means ? It means that a sense of humor is so foreign to Talbot 's nature that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounters it . Of course , this is just selfpreservation in action . A sense of humor would ruin him in a minute . Have you ever read any of his books ? " " Well , I 've read about them , " Martin said . " That 's the best approach , " Benson said , " as long as you do n't believe anything they tell you . Talbot benefits from our  | national sense of cultural inferiority . Americans are too unsure of themselves to respect anything they can laugh at , and all too quick to be impressed by anything that 's sufficiently ponderous and solemn . Anything this dull , they think , must be profound . So they conscientiously admire it without ever stopping to think that if the author had a spark of originality or wit or perception or anything at all but a fifth-rate pedestrian mind he could n't possibly be that dull . " " But some profound thinkers expressed themselves pretty tediously , " Martin objected . " Do n't be too sure about them , " Benson warned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being in the least profound . He merely absorbed a little Calvin-and-syrup at his mother 's knee and has been rewriting history ever since in an effort to justify his own religious convictions . " " You know , all along you 've been sounding as if you were quoting from something , " Martin observed . " Well , perhaps I have been , " Benson grunted . " I reviewed Talbot 's last book for the Historical Review , and I made it quite clear what I thought of the man . That 's why it 's so howlingly unfair of the Times to get him to review my book . He 's obviously been itching for revenge for the last two years . This whole piece screams with the petty malice of an injured , over-inflated ego . " Martin had been waiting impatiently for a chance to change the subject , and now Benson 's subdued tone gave him hope . " By the way , " he began , and ended . " Of course , it will be fine for sales , " Benson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talbot the Times probably would n't have reviewed the book at all . " " I suppose not , " Martin said . " I was wondering ? " " And he attacks it so vehemently that all the historians who hate his guts will come rushing to my defense , " Benson theorized ,  | brightening visibly . " Really , I suppose I ought to be grateful to the man . What were you wondering , Martin ? " " Well , " said Martin , deciding that under the circumstances there was more to be gained from a direct approach than a circuitous one , " well , you knew Sally before she came to live in Alden Park , did n't you ? " " Sally ? " asked Benson . " Sally Teal ? Of course I did . You knew all about that . What does she have to do with Talbot ? " " Nothing , " Martin admitted . " What did you mean when you said I knew all about that ? " " I told you all about Sally and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't remember , " Martin said . He had n't even been aware that Sally had ever been married . " You must , " said Benson , whose own memory was phenomenal , and who never could understand that everyone was not just like him . " Surely you recall my telling you about a young new colleague in my department , a very brilliant fellow I was quite interested in . He taught Ancient History , but he knew more about the Middle Ages than a lot of specialists ever do . Larry Burton was his name . Does n't that ring any sort of bell ? " " Very vaguely , " Martin said . " He asked my help on a book , and I got very friendly with both him and his wife , Sally . I distinctly remember telling you that she was the only vivacious girl I 'd ever known who also had a brain in her head . " " And that 's Sally Teal ? " Martin asked , unable to associate the adjective " vivacious " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benson said disgustedly . " I naturally assumed you 'd made the connection years ago , though at Sally 's request I made a point of saying nothing about her background . Honestly , Martin , at times you carry your self-centeredness  | much too far . If all this comes as a surprise to you it can only be because you simply do n't listen when friends tell you about people you do n't happen to know . " " But what happened to them ? " Martin asked . " Sally and her husband , I mean . " " They were divorced four years ago , " Benson replied . " That much is a matter of public record , so there 's no reason why I should n't tell you . Beyond that , you 'll have to go to Sally . It 's her story , and I promised never to breathe a word of it to anyone . As far as I know , it 's the only secret I 've ever managed to keep successfully , and I do n't propose to spoil the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be budged . Indeed , the more Martin pressed him to talk about Sally , the more determined he seemed to get back to his arch-enemy , Cyril Talbot , who was evidently nearly as ludicrous as Spengler , if not quite . Martin stayed home that evening out of sheer pride . He wanted to go over to see Sally , but he had said he would see her on Friday and he refused to go crawling ( for that was how he thought of it ) a minute sooner . But he was desperately bored and depressed and restless . He tried playing the piano for a while , but this was definitely one of those times when the left hand had n't the remotest idea what the right hand was doing , and after three assaults on a Chopin Prelude had failed to produce anything but discords he gave up , and looked for something else to do . He remembered that he wanted to look up some word that Benson had used that afternoon ? " jejune , " that was it . A perfectly commonplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some reason the meaning had never stuck in his mind , and he looked it up periodically at least once a year . He went  | into the study for the dictionary , and the overhead light blew out as he switched it on . He was grateful for the task of having to replace the bulb , but for the moment he was content to fumble in the dark for the dictionary . He carried it  --  both volumes , to be on the safe side  --  into the living-room . It was the Shorter Oxford , which Grace had given him one Christmas as a sop to his anglophilia . She had thought his fondness for it an affectation , and had never hesitated to say so in that archly nagging manner which had been her substitute for teasing . He looked up " jejune " and found that it meant " unsatisfying and insipid " which was approximately what he had guessed . The dictionary was indelibly associated with Grace not merely because she had given it to him , but also because it had , strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had passed from wishing Grace were dead to thinking of doing something about it . A small hurdle , but a momentous one . In retrospect , Martin found it hard to understand why it had taken him so long to arrive at a decision so logical . The marriage had not been six months old before his disillusionment had been complete , and he had taken the position that he would play the sort of husband Grace wanted in return for the comparative luxury of life in Alden Park . If his love had vanished without a trace , Martin had sincerely tried to replace it with affection  --  but this Grace had destroyed within the year by the petty attrition of indifference . After that , there was nothing left but play-acting , for he had come to feel nothing for Grace but hatred . It was a quiet hatred , which rarely came to the surface because Grace had despised scenes of any sort . It was a mild hatred , which expended itself in reveries of the contented ,        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
