Nowadays , artists switch styles as often as their wives change hairdos . But things were slower in Egypt . For 3,000 years , Egyptian artists respected the same old rules . Egypt 's painters apparently learned theirs from papyrus scrolls which depicted almost everything they might be commissioned to produce . Art was mostly a matter of faithful copying ; those who learned the trade became " scribes of outlines . " But the painters who adorned Egypt 's tombs had a bit more freedom than her sculptors and architects . <P> One liberty , which in itself amounted to a convention , was to leave a picture or two in each tomb unfinished . Another was to depict wildlife just as it looks . Third , and most important , there was an occasional flicker of human interest . A farm boy giving up his donkey to the tax collector might be shown pouting ; a queen playing chess might assume a mysterious smile ; a bureaucrat might be counting on his fingers . <P> Such details help make Egyptian tomb painting easy for moderns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in ancient Egypt was like , but color reproductions have been hard to find . A lavishly illustrated book out next week , Egyptian Painting ( Skira ; $20 ) , will give many readers their first close-up view of the subject . The book concentrates on the necropolis hewn from the hills west of Thebes during the New Kingdom ( circa 1500-1100 B.C. ) . There , over 400 mausoleums deep inside the rock show scenes from the lives of the dead , and of the eternal life they hoped to achieve . <P> Paintings of the afterlife are minimized in the volume , says Author Arpag Mekhitarian , partly because " our modern sensibility is allergic to these half-human , half-animal beings . . . whose greenish skins signify at once the decomposition of the corpse and the rebirth of vegetable life . " From the Garden of Ialu ( bottom , opposite ) , the book reproduces only the fraction which shows a man plowing and might be an earthly scene . Actually , Ialu was a forerunner of the Greek Islands of the Blessed .

As the pictures show , hunting , fishing , farming , brickmaking , butchering , carpentering , dancing , drinking , feasting and mourning were essentially the same then as now . <P> A few of the paintings are masterpieces which bear out a dictum of the sage Ptahhotep ( see hieroglyphics below ) : " No limit may be set to art ... " The majority , however , for all their historical interest , are either stereotyped or clumsy , and illustrate the second half of Ptahhotep 's saying : " . . . Neither is there any craftsman that is fully master of his craft . "
