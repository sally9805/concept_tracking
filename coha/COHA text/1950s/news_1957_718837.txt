txt The French political crisis can hardly be called surprising even though its precise timing was unexpected . For weeks it has been clear enough that the Socialist Premier , Guy Mollet , was heading for trouble and he seemed reconciled to defeat . To have lasted sixteen months , a record for the post-war period , was remarkable enough . One 's first comment , in fact , must be a tribute to M. Mollet , whose skill as a politician and whose courage and sensibleness as a . statesman have placed him in the front ranks of France 's leaders . He will be a man to reckon with for years ' to . come . French politics seem capricious , but there are ? always logic and method in their apparent madness . At this moment , while President Coty is seeking a successor , it is best simply to try to understand what happened and why it happened . It was typical of French politics that the longest-lived Government should have had the narrowest of bases . M. Mollet worked for sixteen months with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socialists and a great many of the Radical Socialists . President Coty chose Guy Mollet after the general elections of Jan , 2 , 1956 , because the Right had received a setback and it was necessary to form a Government that was oriented to the Left Center and would carry on without the large bloc of Communists on the extreme Left and the Poujadists on the extreme Right . From the beginning Premier Mollet had to follow policies that would win the support of the European-minded Popular Republican Movement ( M. R. P. ) and a large part of the Independents and Peasants , who controlled more than ninety of the 596 seats in the National Assembly . These Independents were generally held in line by . the strong policy M. Mollet tried to follow in Algeria and by avoiding social and economic policies that were too radical . Premier Mollet did this with great skill , but he was also able to survive many threatened crises for a common and effective reason in French politics : no one else wanted his job . However , the Government 's political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field of policy . The situation in Algeria is essentially no better than it was a year and a half ago . Premier Mollet was stuck with a plan that was good in theory but was not working out in practice . The idea was first to pacify Algeria and . then to bring about elections and a degree , of autonomy , but Algeria has not been pacified and the 1,200m00 French and other European settlers are still not reconciled to the loss of their supremacy . The cost of the Algerian - campaigns  --  something like $1,200,000 , - 000 a year  --  was a heavy drain on the budget . At the same time the balance of payments and the balance of trade have ? been going heavily against France . Reserves are threatened and so is the franc . The paradox in the situation is that the French are enjoying a period of considerable prosperity . But this in turn means that domestic consumption is using up goods which might to be exported and it also brings inflationary pressures . To meet these economic and fiscal imbalances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . to be reduced and taxes raised . That is why Guy Mollet i no longer Premier . The Deputies especially the Independents on th Right , would not vote for highs taxes  --  at least not the first tim and not for a Socialist Premie These same Deputies must knot that whoever now becomes Premie will also have to ask for higher taxe and cuts in , imports , but with a nev non-Socialist Government ' it will b possible next time to vote for wha was refused a few days ago . This means that nothing new different is to be expected in Franci Much the same men in the earn parties will do the same things .. Whe it comes to " muddling through " th French are at least as good a the British . The natural wealth of th country , the essential solidity the social fabric and the high qual ity of the permanent administrativ structure , especially the civil sere ' ice , will keep France going fo many a long year .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
