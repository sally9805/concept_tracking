The motives that move Columnist Walter Winchell 's wormlike thrusts are mysterious to the average man-but not so mysterious to those who feel the pressure of his vermiform " journalism . " Of late weeks , he has been relentlessly worming away at a little-known Manhattan restaurant called Chandler 's . According to Winchell , the place is a " gyp joint " run by gougers and chiselers . Stork Clubber Winchell has never been seen in Chandler 's himself , but in the past three weeks he has extruded no less than twelve items , even repeating one attack three times . Last week Chandler 's owners retorted with a $1,000,000 libel suit against Winchell , the Hearst Corp . and King Features , which distributes his column . <P> What Was It All About ? Those familiar with Winchell 's vindictive memory and oblique methods of revenge had no trouble guessing that his real target was not Chandler 's but its unctuous disk jockey , Barry Gray , 36 , whose name Winchell never mentions in the attacks . Gray , who mixes only an infrequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program , " broadcast by Manhattan 's WMCA , committed an unpardonable sin last year . He turned his microphone over to New York Daily News Columnist Ed Sullivan for an hourlong , scathing attack on Winchell ( TIME , Jan. 7 ) . Those who knew Winchell waited to see how soon he would turn on upstart Disk Jockey Gray . <P> Late last month Winchell got his chance : Chandler 's was named as one of 13 New York restaurants which the OPS accused of violating price ceilings . Hearst 's Journal-American TV Columnist Jack O'Brian lent Colleague Winchell a helping hand with thinly disguised items about a certain " fishface " disk jockey , whom he accused of every crime from welshing on his debts to collecting graft to finance a trip to Europe . <P> Gray hustled back from a European vacation and resumed his broadcasts nine days early . He announced that he was ready to reply to " rabbit punches and low blows " from anyone . However , it was not Winchell but another Hearst columnist , the Journal-American 's Frank Conniff , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We say to these press agents and producers and personalities who give their support to Mr. Gray : ' That 's just dandy . But surely do n't be surprised if we here at the Journal-American invite you to keep getting your plugs from him , and not to expect very much from us . Mr. Gray is hot , red-hot , and he is all yours . ' " Snapped back Gray : " Thinly veiled blackmail . " <P> At week 's end , Winchell quoted one of O'Brian 's columns to pose a question to his readers : " One disk jockey so far has n't discussed the fact that he wrote for the Daily Worker under a nom de Commie . " Winchell had no intention of giving away a hot scoop like that by mentioning a name . The description fit nothing known about Gray , but if readers wanted to think Winchell and O'Brian were talking about Gray , it was apparently all right with them .                  @ @ @
