" It is a most curious situation , perhaps unique in these courts , " mused Mr. Justice Devlin last week , " that the act of murder has to be proved by expert evidence . " Even Dr. John Bodkin Adams , the defendant in one of the longest murder trials in Old Bailey 's history , was said to have asked in wonderment , " Can you prove it was murder ? " , when police arrested him last December on suspicion of having poisoned his eccentric old patient , Mrs. Edith Alice Morrell , in seaside Eastbourne six years earlier . <P> During the three weeks of Adams ' trial , as the eyes of the whole newspaper-reading world focused in fascination on the pudgy , amiable defendant , expert after expert took the stand at the behest of the crown 's prosecutor , Attorney General Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller . No one denied that on Dr. Adams ' orders large doses of heroin , morphine and paraldehyde had been administered to the ailing , 81-year-old widow during the long illness that preceded her death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her end or merely , as the defense contended , eased the pain of her inevitable passing . The more the experts talked , the less the laymen on the jury could be sure of anything . <P> Yes ? Throughout the long hours of technical testimony , the clouds of doubt were continuously marshaled by the skilled cross-examination of another kind of expert : Defense Attorney Geoffrey Lawrence , Q.C . A puckish , mousy little man with a mind as orderly as a calculating machine . Barrister Lawrence , specialist in real estate and divorce cases , was a relative stranger in criminal court . In his curled white wig and black silk robe , he lacked entirely the stage color of the traditional defense lawyer ; yet almost apologetically he managed to leave witness after witness floundering in confusion . <P> As he took the stand to answer the questions of the prosecutor , Harley Street 's distinguished Dr. Arthur Henry Douthwaite , British authority on morphia and heroin , seemed utterly free of doubt . " The only conclusion I can come to , " he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morrell , " is the intention was to terminate her life . " But in crossexamination , Defense Counsel Lawrence had a question : In treating a patient already addicted to drugs , would not a doctor have to face two alternatives , the first of which would be to stop the drugs ? " Yes , " said Dr. Douthwaite . <P> " And it is part of your case , " said Barrister Lawrence , " that stopping a drug like morphia or heroin will cause illness and suffering ? " " Yes , " said the doctor . <P> " And in the case of an old woman verging on 81 it might very well cause collapse ? " " Yes , " said the doctor . <P> " With the risk of death ? " the defense counsel went on . " Yes . " <P> " Then . " concluded Lawrence , " the other course must be to go on and give her more ? " " Yes , " said Dr. Douthwaite.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
