Roy Campanella , 31 , remembers " the old days in the Negro leagues when I once caught four games in one day , then rode a bus all night . " His pay for that kind of work used to be $65 a month . <P> Nowadays , Catcher Campanella , a Cadillac owner , draws more than $30,000 a year in salary from the Brooklyn Dodgers - and is worth every penny of it . A canny handler of pitchers . Campanella this week was also leading the National League in hitting ( .370 ) , and he had driven in almost twice as many runs ( 43 ) as anybody else , and was leading both leagues in homers ( 12 in 26 games ) . <P> " It 's just luck , " says Campy . " When you 're hitting , you hit . " Sturdy Catcher Campanella ( 5 ft. 8 in. , 195 Ibs. ) should know : he has had other dazzling early-season hitting streaks which faded into just plain competence by midseason . But he acknowledges that he is standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did last year , when his season 's batting average was only .269 . " That gives me a little more wood on the ball . " Whatever the explanation , Campanella 's hitting is a profound source of pleasure to Brooklyn Manager Charley Dressen. who has been shuffling his players frantically to get more power into his lineup . But Dressen is even more pleased , if possible , with Campanella the backstop than with Campanella the batter . " He 's really a great catcher , " says Dressen. happily ticking off Campy 's virtues . " The pitchers like to pitch to him . Not many balls get by him . He picks men off bases , and that builds up the pitcher 's confidence . " Not one of the game 's " holler guys , " Campanella chats less with his pitchers during a game than most catchers . Most of the pitching strategy is worked out before the game begins . " When the pitchers get in trouble . " says Campanella , " that 's when I start kicking the dirt around the plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself by injuries last season , after winning the league 's Most Valuable Player award in 1951 . This year , off to a flying start , Workhorse Campanella , who has caught every Brooklyn game so far , says he 'll catch them all if Manager Dressen will let him . " Dressen talks about giving me a rest once in a while . What do I want with a rest ? This is a breeze compared to the old days . "
