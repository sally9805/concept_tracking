txt George M. Humphrey urged today a sharp cutback in. special tax concessions to industries building defense facilities . The expected loss in taxes during the current fiscal year because of tax write-offs , the Secretary of the Treasury said , would amount to a new high of 5880,000,000 . Extension of the present program , he added , may stand in the way of general tax reductions for all taxpayers . Mr. Humphrey told a House of Representatives subcommittee the program begun in 1950 to stimulate defense expansion could become a hindrance to balanced and vigorous growth of the national economy if continued unabated . Taxes now generally are " too high , " Mr. Humphrey told the group . They would be reduced as major reductions were effected in Federal spending , he said . The Administration recognizes , he said , that reductions in Federal expenditures could bring on unemployment and depressed economic conditions . For that reason , the Secretary went on , the Administration has sacrificed a balanced budget last year for a tax bill that brought $1,363,000,000 in tax relief to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut had not followed the Administration 's cuts in spending " we would have had serious unemployment and been thrown into the depression the prophets of doom and gloom were talking about . " The Secretary cited recent tax changes as one reason why the tax write-offs for defense expansion should be sharply cur-1 tailed . When the program was adopted , he said , the excess-profits tax took up to 82 per - cent of the corporate business profits and tended to discourage large spending for new plants . That tax , the Secretary noted , was repealed as of Jan. 1 , 1954 . Moreover , he added , the new liberalized depreciation methods reduce the need for " singling out particular taxpayers or particular facilities for more favorable treatment than others receive . " " It is not the American way , " the Secretary declared . Under the rapid tax amortization program , the Government permits companies to subtract from income as depreciation as much as 85 per cent of their investment in five years , instead of spreading ' out over the longer period of twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 30 , nearly 20,000 tax write-off certificates were outstanding . Repeal Not Proposed Secretary Humphrey said he was not proposing rePeal of the program . However , he made it clear that " I would come back riarris &; Ewing URGES CUTBACK : Secretary of Treasury George M. Humphrey , who asked curtailment of the program of granting tax concessions to industries in defense work . land recommend repeal " if the program was not curtailed . It ! should be used only " sparingly land very rigidly and strictly confined to direct " defense needs , he urged . Final decisions on the scope of the program , he added , are awaiting the results of a study by the Office of Defense Mobilization ; which certifies the defense industries for the tax benefits . As a possible future program , however , Mr. Humphrey proposed that Congress through appropriations ' grant the " subsidies for or assistance to special communities or for special purposes . " If the Treasury had asked Congress to authorize spending the $880,000,000 that represents the tax loss this fiscal year , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the past , the Secretary aid , the tax write-off program was of real- assistances in preparing the country for war. , It till can be useful if limited " exlusively to ' that end , " he said . But , he added , it is an " artificial stimulus of a dangerous type . " The Sec  --  etary 's comments on general tax reductions were made in response to questions by Representative Robert H. Moll ? . ltan , West Virginia Democrat , chairman of the subcommittee on Legal and Monetary Affairs , a unit of the Government Operations Committee . Mr. Mollohan commented there appeared to be " no reason for optimism " for an across-theboard tax cut in view of no immediate prpspects for cutting Federal spending , Secretary Humphrey replied , " I would n't say that . " He said there was a great lack of efficiency and sound planning in Government and improvements in Federal operations could lead to savings and hence tax cuts . The Treasury chief emphasized his belief that " we should still try to balance the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group that " in some way , in some time , tile defense burden for- the whole world is going to be reduced . " That will be the time , he said , for " big reduction " in Government spending , clearing the road for cuts in taxes and reducing the national debt ,
