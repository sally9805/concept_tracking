Bright Road ( M-G-M ) , a drama of Southern Negro life , spins a slight , sentimental story about a pretty , fourth-grade schoolteacher ( Dorothy Dandridge ) and a handsome principal ( Harry Bellafonte ) who , through kindness and understanding , reform a rebellious , eleven-year-old pupil ( Philip Hepburn ) . The picture tells its story simply and straightforwardly . Unfortunately , for all its charm , it often seems unreal . The writing and direction are stilted , things have a too-well-scrubbed look , and the characters frequently appear stiff and selfconscious . In the main roles . Nightclub Singers Dandridge and Bellafonte , making their movie debuts , are at their best when the picture gives them an opportunity to sing a lullaby , a church hymn , or a folk song . <P> <P> Trouble Along the Way ( Warner ) travels a well-worn screen route along which moviegoers will encounter some fairly familiar figures : a humorously crotchety rector ( Charles Coburn ) of an impoverished Roman Catholic college , a cynical ex-football coach ( John Wayne ) who comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a winning gridiron team , a pretty probation officer ( Donna Reed ) who , at the instigation of Wayne 's unpleasant ex-wife ( Marie Windsor ) , is investigating whether Wayne 's eleven-year-old daughter ( Sherry Jackson ) is being neglected by her father . By the time Trouble Along the Way reaches its dramatic destination , the football team has won , the school has its funds , and Sherry has a new mother in the person of the probation officer . <P> Shrewdly contrived , Trouble Along the Way goes all the way in trying to squeeze the last tear and laugh from its material . Nonetheless , it is high-toned hokum . Stealing the show from veteran Actors Coburn and Wayne is eleven-year-old Sherry Jackson in an artfully artless performance as Wayne 's pert young daughter . <P> <P> I Believe in You ( J. Arthur Rank ; Universal-International ) is a British-made film that sets out to show the human side of the law . It succeeds in its aim all too well . Taking as its central characters a couple of probation officers attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melodrama on its theme to convince even the most doubting moviegoer that probation officers and probationers are human , after all . <P> In a kaleidoscopic series of case histories , a gallery of probationers , ranging from the wicked to the underprivileged and mentally defective , are pictured in predicaments ranging from comedy to tragedy . A few of the excessive characters : a young hoodlum ( Harry Fowler ) and a delinquent teen-ager ( Joan Collins ) who fall in love with each other ; a drunken society girl ( Ursula Howells ) ; an old lady ( Katie Johnson ) who suffers from the delusion that her cats are being poisoned ; a faded vaudeville star ( Ada Reeve ) living on her memories and press clippings . <P> The direction and acting are more restrained than the plot . Celia ( Brief Encounter ) Johnson makes the part of a dedicated probation officer warmly moving . As a retired Colonial-Office official who decides to take up probation work , Cecil Parker brings a jauntily sly humor to his role . <P>       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
