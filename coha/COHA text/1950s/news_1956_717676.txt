EDEN PUTS STRESS ON NEED OF UNITY // United States in the development of nuclear power for industry . To the senate the British leader offered a three-point program to put into effect the Declaration of Washington , which he and President Eisenhower signed yesterday : 1 . The alliances of the West must be maintained firmly and loyally but must include a will-1 ingness to confer with powers of the Communist bloc so long ' as the West understands the methods that will be used against it at such meetings . 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must ' be proclaimed wherever there is danger of conflict and " the more prepared we are the less likely is an emergency to arise . " 3 . It is " useless " to chase Soviet economic bids around the ' world , attempting to cap each one with a better American or British offer . The West must give economic aid in those areas where it is most needed , " putting first the reasonable requiftients of our . friends , but ' rot forgetting others . " When the Prime Minister told the House of Representatives that , apart from a measure of defense aid , " we now stand on , our own feet " and " we intend to continue to da so , " his words evoked a shattering round of applause . Although he did not include it in his program , Sir Anthony indicated to both Senate and House the course he believed the West must follow in handling the emerging nationalisms of Africa and Asia . This is the encouragement of steady progress toward self-government . " It is our faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the confidence which self-government breeds is the best antidote in the world to communism . " Defense Effort Emphasized The emphasis the Prime Minister placed on this aspect of Britain 's changing Empire and Commonwealth in speeches and the stress he it upon Britain 's efforts in defense and nuclear power reflect Sir Anthony 's belief that these are aspects of the British record not sufficiently well known in this country . Surveying the world in his Senate speech , the Prime Minister found it a " somber ' , prospect . Britain , the United States and the Soviet Union , he said , possess the means to annihilate each other . But he described one redeeming feature . This , he said , is that in the age of nuclear warfare " oblivion confronts aggressor and victim alike . " " I wish I could say that on this account all possibility of world conflict is excluded , " Sir Anthony continued . " I can not . The direct danger is reduced . The indirect threat remains and its consequences can equally be mortal . " Blocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats and inducements , offering arms and dealing out denunciations " all couched in terms of fierce hostility " to the West , he said . Communism can not be held or driven back by force of arms alone , Sir Anthony emphasized . The Western powers , he declared , must counter with friendship , freedom and offers that will raise living standards . Western philosophy must be made clear to the peoples of Asia and Africa , Sir Anthony declared , and the emergent nations invited to join the free world . But he pointed out that the West could neither compel these countries to join nor hold them by force once they had done so . After describing the steady growth of the British Commonwealth and the nations now approaching Commonwealth status , Sir Anthony pointed out the difference between the British conception of colonial responsibility and that of the Russians . Khrushchev Remark Recalled In this connection he recalled a recent remark of Nikita S , Khrushchev , Soviet Communist party secretary , to Harold Wilson , a former Labor party Minister . According to Mr. Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should go into other countries except to pump out their wealth and resources . Referring to the work he had done with the President over the last three days , Sir Anthony asserted Britain and the United States had shown that they could work together in the closest comradeship and that unity of purpose and policy was so strong that there was no need to conceal differences . The Prime Minister also emphasized in his speech to the House of Representatives that aid to the new nations must have no political strings attached . Here again he was making the British point that the foreign policies of the free world " should fairly measure up to the realities of the world in which we live . " The principles the free world holds , and will continue to hold , the Prime Minister declared , are the sanctity of treaties , good faith between nations and the interdependence of peoples " from which no country , however powerful , can altogether escape . " But the Western powers , he reemphasized to the House , should not fear contact with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in itself , it should be prepared and ready to meet Communists , Sir Anthony declared .
