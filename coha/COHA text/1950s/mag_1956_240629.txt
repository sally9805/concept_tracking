From his Fontana ( Calif. ) plant , Henry J. Kaiser supplies the West Coast with more steel than any other steelmaker . Since he built the plant during World War II , he has expanded it seven times to keep up with a fast-growing demand . Last week Kaiser announced that he will spend $113 million to boost capacity 40% to 1,528,000 tons yearly . <P> Fontana 's addition is only a small part of Kaiser Industries ' vast expansion under Henry J. and his son , President Edgar F. Kaiser , 47 . Edgar is also directing a $33 million expansion for Permanente Cement and a $500 million expansion for Kaiser Aluminum which will push it up to second place in the industry , 28% behind Alcoa . <P> But the backbone of the business is still construction . Last week Kaiser had a $638,500,000 backlog of construction and engineering jobs , biggest in its history . In addition , Kaiser is the managing firm ( with 25% interest ) in the joint construction group that is building Australia 's Snowy Mountains Project , a $56 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tunnels . <P> The company is still having trouble with its auto business . Willys ' domestic sales slumped 18% during 1956 's first quarter . However , export sales jumped 29% , and Edgar Kaiser thinks the future of the auto company lies abroad . Kaiser 's new Willys plant in Argentina started producing last month , and he is negotiating for a complete manufacturing operation in Brazil , has already licensed assembly plants in Turkey and Israel .
