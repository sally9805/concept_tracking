Matyas Rakosi is the kind of old Communist revolutionary who left talk about civil liberties , land reform and the like to the parlor set . At 27 he was a hard-bitten commissar in the regime of Hungarian Red Terrorist Bela Kun ; at 28 he was in Moscow as a secretary of the Comintern Executive , perfecting methods for smuggling agents into foreign lands , and capturing control of trade unions . <P> At 34 he went back to his native Hungary for illegal work , was captured , twice . sentenced to long jail terms . Tried on 25 charges of murder , another 17 cases of inciting to murder , Rakosi spat at the court : " I do not intend to justify my actions . I honestly pursued my Communist convictions . I have no cause whatever to relent . " <P> In 1940 , after the Hitler-Stalin pact , Moscow persuaded Germany to pressure Hungary into releasing Rakosi after 15 years in jail , mostly in solitary . He went straight to Russia , was dubbed a Soviet colonel-general , and 4 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies . <P> There , Rakosi began applying his famed salami tactics : " Demanding a little more each day , like cutting up a salami , thin slice after thin slice . " While the rest of the government was dominated and run by the Smallholders and the Socialists , Rakosi demanded and got for his party the Interior Ministry ( and thereby control of the police ) . Then his police trumped up charges against the Smallholders and Socialists , one by one , in two years eliminated them entirely . Though Rakosi's-Reds never won more than 17% of the vote in free elections , they took over the government in 1947 and have been turning down the screws ever since . <P> Last week , on Hungary 's warmest summer day , sweat gathered on Rakosi 's bulging , bald head and poured down his round face as he took the last slice of the salami . The puppet Hungarian National Assembly , which usually meets for a few dutiful days twice a year , held a special session and crowned Matyas Rakosi Premier of Hungary .
