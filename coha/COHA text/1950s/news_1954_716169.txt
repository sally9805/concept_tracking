Riegelman Sees Inequity Harold Riegelman , counsel to the Citizens Budget Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small business . ? " Thousands operate on a margin of profit so small this tax will prove confiscatory , " he explained . " The major portion of receipts may be expected to come from taxes on services by one business to another . This will therefore be another hidden tax reflected in the price of goods the consumer buys . " Business firms which perform their own services will not have to pay . Service businesses with large volume and low profit margins would be more heavily taxed than those with low volume and high profit margins . Some businesses might , therefoie , be driven out of existence . " The tax could constitute a strong deterrent to the high level of construction urgently needed in New York . Some businesses , particularly those ' doing a large volume of out-of-city business , such as advertising , might move all or part of their offices outside the city . " He cited among businesses that would be hard hit the building maintenance services and companies supplying wired music to restaurants . Thomas Jefferson Miley , executive vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated the annual incidence of the tax at $50,000,000 and called this an extremely conservative estimate .

" Advertising , the agent 's fees ? for which are subject to the tax , would pay over $6,000 , - 000 . " Real estate , which will have to pay an additional $50,000,000 in realty taxes next year , would be required to give up still another $6,000,000 under the Mayor 's proposal because of its application to building repair , maintenance . cleaning services , etc . " He added that the commissions of stock brokers , real estate brokers , commission merchants and other agents would be subject to the new tax .

He urged every member to protest to the Mayor and other city officials against " this latest attempt to discriminate further against an industry already heavily penalized for bringing business to New York .

It said business should be encouraged to remain in the city , not discouraged from locating here .
