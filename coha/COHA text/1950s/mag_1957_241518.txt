Over burgundy and brandy at Boston 's Parker House in May 1857 , there occurred a rare fusion of good minds and venturesome money . In ten hours at table , eight Bostonians agreed to start a magazine " devoted to literature , art and politics " that would " endeavor to be the exponent of what its conductors believe to be the American idea . " Thus was born the Atlantic Monthly , whose first issue , edited by Poet James Russell Lowell , appeared 100 years ago this week . Eight editors , 1,200 issues and some 100 million words later , the Atlantic is the second oldest magazine of ideas ( after 107-year-old Harper 's ) in the U.S. , and one of the few in any country to survive a century . <P> Molded Mandate . Still edited in Boston , the unorthodox , politically independent Atlantic has grown from a genteel gazette for Brahmins into a national monthly of moment that boasts more readers in California than in any Eastern state . From Walt Whitman to Archibald MacLeish , from Thoreau to Thornton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every decade since its founding . In its broader role as an exponent of the American idea , it has molded its mandate to the times and , at its best , brought to trie vital issues of the day that " nervous force " without which , as Atlantic Editor Walter Hines Page said in 1902 , " a magazine deserves to die . " <P> The alert Atlantic was one of the first U.S. magazines to devote regular sections to news of education , art , music and science . It plunged eagerly into controversies over Darwin and Al Smith , published William James 's eloquent plea for world government ten years before World War I , exposed Stock Exchange malpractices in 1926 that were not banned by law until after the crash . Unlike most " quality " magazines , the Atlantic today aims at giving the reader a well-rounded view of the month 's events as well as the standard quota of articles and criticism . <P> Papa 's Fifty Grand . The Atlantic 's nervous force was apparent in its first year , when Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and John Greenleaf Whittier contributed poetry , and Oliver Wendell Holmes , who had given the Atlantic its name , wrote The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table . The Atlantic , long famed for its fiction , has " enjoyed a perpetual state of literary grace , " as Professor Frank Luther Mott once noted . When Boston started fading as literary hub of the U.S. , the magazine introduced its readers to such diverse talents as Bret Harte and Kipling , Mark Twain and Henry James . <P> In competition with better-heeled fiction magazines , the Atlantic-which helped pioneer the short story-has long been forced to search for stories by new and inexpensive writers , and has started many U.S. authors on the road to fame . Example : in 1927 , after Cosmopolitan , the old Scribner 's , Saturday Evening Post and Collier 's had all turned down a brutally succinct short story about a crooked prizefighter , it was accepted by Staffer Edward Weeks , now editor of the Atlantic . Titled Fifty Grand , it was the first story by Ernest Hemingway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
