In France , no one who likes to eat and sleep well would think of setting out on an auto trip without a fat little red book in his pocket . The book : the Guide Michelin , maker and breaker of restaurant reputations all over France and one of the smartest promotion stunts ever dreamed up . <P> Last week the 1952 Michelin went on sale . A perennial bestseller ( U.S. price : $3.75 ) , the guidebook 's print order is 200,000 copies , twice as much as the prewar figure . Its 880 pages are crammed with maps and tourist information of all sorts , with special emphasis on 8,000 hotels and restaurants . <P> In all France , only seven restaurants* now rate Michelin 's top billing of three stars ; 62 rate two stars . One notable change : Paris ' famed Tour d'Argent restaurant , where pressed duck has fed thousands of high-spending U.S. and European bons vivants , has lost its three-star rating . <P> Tires &; Symbols . Frenchmen and foreigners alike rely on the verdicts of Michelin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation for accuracy and incorruptibility . Its motto is Pas de piston , pas de pot de vin-roughly , " No pull , no bribery . " Not a line of paid advertising is carried on its pages . <P> The guidebook was started at the turn of the century by Edouard and Andr Michelin , the bearded brothers who invented the first removable bicycle tire and are credited with the introduction of the pneumatic auto tire . With the advent of the horseless carriage , Andr Michelin figured that a reliable guidebook would give both tourism and the tire business a boost . He was right . Today the Michelin Tire Co. , still family-owned , is one of the biggest in the world . Worth some $57 million , it has plants in France , Italy , Britain , Belgium , Spain and Argentina . Michelin loses about $57,000 a year on its little red guide book , but it has spread the company 's name all over the world . <P> Michelin 's guide long ago solved the language problem by using symbols to describe hotels and restaurants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locality ; a spigot , a hotel which has cold running water only ; a pitcher , no running water at all . A candle tells the tourist that a place has no electricity , a radiator that there is central heating . There is a symbol for a bathroom ; " Le w.c. " says one Michelin editor professionally , " c'est trs important " Aside from its stars , the Michelin guide has special symbols for restaurants-five pairs of crossed forks and spoons for a de luxe place , one for a " plain but good " restaurant . The number of tiny bottles indicates the quality of the wine cellar . <P> Tips &; Onions . To gather all its detailed information , Michelin relies on 92 regional representatives , tire-company employees all over France , and five full-time inspectors who spend their days and nights eating their way through the nation . Michelin inspectors never reveal their identity until the meal is over , and woe to the chef who is having an off day . From their voluminous reports , the home office keeps up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little Normandy inn may be slipping because of troubles at home .
