txt WASHINGTON , Nov. 26 ? The Administration appeared tonight to be fighting a desperate rearguard action to preserve the framework of wage and price controls until the party had left office in January . Labor , business groups , Southern Democrats and RepubJicans were banded together in an effort to force the Administration 's hand . Roger L. Putnam , Director of I Economic Stabilization , disclosed that Michael V. DiSalle , former head of the Office of Price Stabilization , was being called back to serve for several weeks , beginning Monday , as a special consultant on control methods and policy . A two-hour conference of high officials at the White House tonight ended without an announcement . The question under study at the meeting was not whether to junk controls entirely but I whether it would be feasible to drop wage and price curbs in the coal industry alone . If this could be done without // bringing demands from other major industries , it was explained , the Administration would be relieved of its major current headache in the threatened strike of miners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $1.50 a day , instead of the $1.90 that operators agreed to pay . John L. Lewis ' United Mine Workers ( have threatened to strike if $1.90 is not allowed , while industry and public members of the tripartite wage board have threatened to resign unless the Administration upheld the board rulings . Up to the White House Technically , the decision on the matter is in the hands of Mr. Putnam , nominal boss of wage and price policies . Mr. Putnam announced today that no decision would be made before the early part of next week . Actually , the decision on the coal wage problem will be made in the White House . The conference tonight was one of several in the last few days . At the meeting in addition to Mr. Putnam were Henry H. Fowler , Director of Defense Mobilization ; Dr. John R. Steelman , assistant to the President , and David L. Cole , Federal mediation chief . The Democratic party is striving to avoid the onus of being the party to jettison the controls it worked so hard to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand before the new Congress convened Jan. 3 and thus escape the task of voting price and wage controls out of existence themselves . Opposition to scrapping controls in the coal industry has come from economists and stabilization officials who argue that steel , transportation and countless other industries will demand similar treatment the instant coal regulations are relaxed . ' Those urging the President to lift coal industry controls hold that the industry presents a special case where suspension of wage and price rules can be justified . Measured by the Administration 's own standards for granting or withholding price increases , the coal industry has such a low rate of earnings that any increase in wages would require almost an automatic compensatory rise in coal prices , it is held . Few industries , the President has been told , can make similar claims to freedom from controls . Discussions on the question of freeing coal are expected to extend through the weekend , with the prospects reportedly weighted in favor of lifting the controls . Meanwhile , Mr. Putnam , in turning today to Mr. DiSalle , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking advice in the emergency created Monday when Tighe E.

A few hours after Mr. Woods acted , Senator Burnet R. Maybank , Democrat of South Carolina , told a radio audience that the President intended to scrap controls by executive order soon . The two incidents gave color to widespread rumors that both 0 . P. S. and the Wage Board were about to shut up shop . Mr. Putnam , a leader of the camp that wants to tighten controls , said he hoped that the announcement that he has invited Mr. DiSalle to come here as his adviser for the next week or two would put an end to reports that controls were about to be abandoned . While he was head of the price office , Mr. ' DiSalle fought steadily against weakening controls . He took the price post in the fall of 1950 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the seat held by Senator John Bricker , Republican of Ohio . He was successful . At the 0 . P. S. headquarters today it was announced that a decision on a proposed rollback in retail beef prices would be delayed until early next week .
