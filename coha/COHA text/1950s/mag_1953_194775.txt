CRIME Grandma <P> One morning last October a mild-mannered , grey-haired little woman walked into the California Bank on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles , quietly approached a teller 's window , and laid a note on the counter . This done , she raised a paper bag in which she seemed to be holding a pistol , and waited patiently . The teller read the message : " This gun will talk and do n't think I ca n't use it , " and handed over $1,212 in currency . <P> Delighted Los Angeles headline writers immediately christened the old lady " Grandma " and waited for her to " strike again . " She did . On Nov. 26 she hit the Citizens National Trust &; Savings Bank for $257 . The cops were , confident that Grandma was the little old lady who got $2,600 from the Union Bank &; Trust Co . <P> Her getaways were wonderful-Grandma just seemed to vanish like smoke . But last week , when she tried to heist a bank in suburban Arcadia , her luck failed . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teller , just called the bank manager , who hustled out and took Grandma 's toy gun away from her . " I 'm not Grandma , " cried Grandma . But when the cops questioned her , she broke down . <P> Grandma said her name was Ethel-Mrs . Ethel Arata , 52 , four times married , four times divorced , and never a grandmother at all . <P> Grandma , it turned out , had gone from riches to rags ; she was the only daughter of the late Robert M. Catts , a New York and Philadelphia financier who made a fast fortune in real estate and lost it in the crash of 1929 . As a rich girl , Ethel traveled in Europe ; afterward she turned to whisky , husbands and psychiatrists . As a holdup artist she was just an inspired , though eminently successful , amateur-she said she never planned her jobs , pulled them only on impulse and gave the money away . But she seemed to be enjoying her career in retrospect . <P> " You know , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good things I have done . But here now - in jail , mind you - I 'm a hero . All the girls are so sorry I was caught . "
