The thin , balding man who walked into the Defense Ministry at Bonn was exactly what the new Bundeswehr wanted . He introduced himself as Herr Doktor Robert Schneider with degrees in medicine , philosophy , psychiatry and law . Unmarried and with a lucrative psychiatric practice in the city of Goslar , Schneider nevertheless wanted to become an army medical officer . " This will mean a personal sacri fice , but money has never been a part of my life , " he said nobly . " One must have ideals . " , <P> That was three years ago . The army enthusiastically grabbed Schneider , appointed him a staff doctor with a major 's salary . Top officers glowed about Schneider 's " outstanding " abilities and moved him to the job of Sachbearbeiter fur psychologische Fragen ( expert on psychological problems ) at the Cologne induction center . There , he worked out a guidance handbook to help officers in screening volunteers for the army , boasted that his methods were used in the induction of 80,000 German soldiers . Said a brigadier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the techniques of induction officers . As a creative worker in the field of military psychology , he has proven high capacity . " <P> The Hoax . But armies also have bureaucracies . The Defense Ministry , completing its routine file , needed additional documentation on Schneider 's German citizenship . The city officials of Goslar could find none , and thus began the first unraveling of a forged life that resulted last week in Robert Schneider 's standing trial in Bonn for 52 cases of fraud , 25 cases of falsification of documents , and various charges of unlawfully assuming academic titles . While all Germany guffawed at the hoax pulled on the new German army , the state prosecutor indignantly stated that the accused was plain Robert Schneider , 39 , a house painter , carpet beater and handyman from Vienna who had already served time in an Austrian jail for earlier forgeries . <P> In court Schneider at first was equally indignant , alleged that his " confession " had been extracted from him by the police " while I was under the influence of alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents , ranging from " proof " that he had been in Nazi concentration camps to " proof " that he had served in the Nazi army . With an embarrassed smile , he agreed that he had used his own falsified army identification card in lectures showing troops how to avoid just such forgeries . Roared the judge : " Did you not become tired of making these forgeries ? " Replied Schneider : " Not really , once I had done the first one , I felt it made no difference if I kept going . " <P> Professional Praise . When the judge expressed amazement at the excellence of one forgery , Schneider turned red with pleasure and stood up and made a small bow towards the bench . Schneider also proudly explained how he avoided detection once . An orderly-room corporal had seen him pocket a rubber stamp for possible future use . With aplomb Schneider returned the stamp , explaining : " I was testing your psychological response . "                 @ @ @ @
