Although few Canadians have ever even heard his name , Thayer Lindsley has probably done more to develop the mineral riches of Canada than any other man of his time . Last week the tall , spare 72-year-old president of Ventures Ltd. called a special meeting of shareholders in Toronto to announce his biggest venture : a hydroelectric power development in the vast Yukon Territory , which may cost up to $2 billion and develop as much as 5,000,000 h.p. , to run a great new metallurgical development in the Canadian Northwest . <P> Lindsley 's vast project will take 20 years or more to complete . A lacework of Yukon rivers and lakes , whose waters now flow north to the Arctic Ocean , will have to be dammed off in the north to form a new lake thousands of square miles in area and nearly 200 ft. deep . The backed-up waters , under one plan , would force the moving of the Yukon 's largest town , Whitehorse ( pop . 2,594 ) , and the rerouting of the Alaska Highway and the Yukon Railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapped , and its waters through tunnels to the Pacific . Energy produced by the waters ' swift drop to the sea will almost triple the output of the famed U.S. Hoover Dam . <P> Deep-Sea Port . At the power site , Ventures plans to build mills and smelters to process ore from the company 's worldwide network of mines . Electric furnaces will manufacture pig iron and steel , fed with iron ore from Ventures ' mines on Vancouver Island , chrome from a Ventures property in the Transvaal , cobalt from New Caledonia and manganese from Southwest Africa . Another plant will manufacture aluminum . Lead and nickel from Ventures ' Canadian mines will be processed on the site . A new , deep-sea port near by will enable ships to deliver ore and carry away finished metals all year round . <P> The development must be carried out in stages , and the first stage-a $250,000 survey of Yukon 's lakes and rivers-is already under way , will be finished late this summer . The first $5,000,000 capital has been raised by sale of debentures , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first 25,000-h.P. pilot power plant will be started . <P> Classmate of F.D.R. No man is better equipped by experience than Thayer Lindsley to launch the Yukon project . The publicity-shy Ventures president has been one of the most successful operators in Canadian mining ever since he went to Canada from the U.S. in the early ' 20s with a nest egg of $30,000 in cash . Lindsley , a Harvard classmate of Franklin Roosevelt , got his initial capital and mining know-how operating an iron mine in Oregon , but it was in Canada that he came into his own . <P> For two decades after Ventures was formed in 1928 , Lindsley often traveled the hinterlands of Canada by pack and canoe , scouting mining properties . Ventures acquired the rich Falconbridge Nickel mines at Sudbury , Ont. , Giant Yellowknife ( gold ) mine , United Keno Hill ( lead ) mines and a dozen other rich Canadian producers . The 20-odd Lindsley-controlled properties listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange are now valued at more than $236 million . Through a maze of 49 holding companies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond Canada and now are on four continents .
