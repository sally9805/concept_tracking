The U.N . General Assembly last week overwhelmingly approved the British resolution ( backed by the U.S. ) for a free , united Korea , with 47 nations voting for it , eight abstaining and only the five Russian bloc countries against it . The resolution recommends " that all appropriate steps be taken to ensure conditions of stability throughout Korea , " thereby implicitly instructing U.N . forces to cross the 38th parallel . <P> The resolution also calls for 1 ) free U.N.-supervised elections and establishment of a democratic regime for all Korea ; 2 ) a seven-nation U.N . commission to help set up the new government and help rehabilitate Korea ; 3 ) speedy relief for the war-torn country .
