Right up to the dramatic climax of President Arbenz ' forced resignation , the war in Guatemala was a strange , onesided air war , fought by three mysterious F47 Thunderbolts and an absurd little Cessna sports plane , all under the command of the leader of the anti-Communist rebels , Colonel Castillo Armas . <P> The F-47s , probably operating from Nicaragua , functioned as a strategic air force , doing the relatively heavy jobs . <P> For two days they bombed and strafed Chiquimula , a provincial capital ( pop . 9,000 ) at the south end of the 130-mile front paralleling the Honduran border . <P> After that Castillo Armas ' guerrillas walked in , took the town without resistance , established headquarters , and set up a provisional government . <P> Tactical Air . The Cessna , at times flying so low it scratched its belly on the treetops , was the rebels ' tactical air force . <P> It dropped antipersonnel grenades on the city of Zacapa , and the government began evacuating civilians . A Thunderbolt worked over a troop train near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and melted into the countryside ; some of them reportedly went over to the rebels . <P> In Guatemala City , meanwhile , F-475 poured bullets into the vitally needed Shell gasoline storage tanks , and 40,000 gallons squirted out . One of the five forts that guard the capital was bombed and set on fire . Arbenz ' emphasis , in his radio talk , on how much the air attacks had hurt , was an eloquent restatement of an old principle : in air war , as in poker , a low hand can win the biggest pot when the opponents hold nothing at all . <P> On the ground , meanwhile , a few U.S. <P> newsmen managed to get a quick look at the rebel army - 2,000-odd Indian-faced peasants , no two dressed alike but most of them wearing blue armbands with the white dagger and cross of the " Liberation Movement . " They fingered black burp guns and seemed to have plenty of ammunition . The officers were upper-crust Guatemalan exiles-lawyers , engineers , coffee planters driven out for their politics or stripped of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . Castillo Armas himself turned out to be a slender , sallow , diffident man in a checked shirt and leather jacket , with a .45 automatic jammed into the belt of his khaki pants . <P> Strategic Aim . The rebel leader at first seemed cold and reserved , but he warmed up in a hurry when asked about his objectives . " Primarily , " he answered , " to throw Communism out of Guatemala . . . All the Guatemalan people are anxious for our arrival . But we must be prepared for every action of the enemy . <P> Communism is not a good enemy ! It is one of the worst enemies we can have in life ! " As the words poured out , his eyes caught fire and his voice rang . <P> If the weekend mood at rebel headquarters was dedication , the mood in Guatemala City was depression . Food supplies were running short and prices were rising . Police were everywhere . Fear and distrust were in the air . Even high-ranking officers carried submachine guns in their own offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
