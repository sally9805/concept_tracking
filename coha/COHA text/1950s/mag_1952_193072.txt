Professor Arnold P. Meiklejohn of Edinburgh University spent last summer in the U.S. studying medical teaching and research , and casting a diagnostic eye over the general U.S. scene . On the whole , he was agreeably surprised . Reports Dr. Meiklejohn in the British journal , Lancet : <P> " The picture that we sometimes get of a materially prosperous but morally sick society derives , I am sure , from too much emphasis on the abnormal behavior of a tiny fraction of the population . . . The mistaken application of Freud 's teaching to the raising of children has produced many spoilt , unhappy adolescents who are only now beginning to find out that the adult world does not automatically give them everything they want . But the influence of the ' Church of Vienna ' fortunately does not extend much beyond the cities , nor much further west than Chicago . . . " <P> The New Frontier . " There is a huge public demand for medical research . The amount of money , new buildings , equipment , and staff now devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as so often in the U.S. , are partly ruthlessly practical and in part pure idealism . On the practical side , the public is moved by an old instinct-fear : fear of death . Although many Americans still adhere to a traditional religion , many have lost its comforts . They are scared of the thought of their end , and look to medicine to save them ... <P> <P> " On the idealistic side , it is evident that science is now the new frontier . . . Almost every young doctor of any promise wants to ' do research . ' To see his own name , even on the dullest paper , makes him a pioneer . . . " But research can get too big for its breeches . " A high-powered scientist said : ' Ten years ago I was happy ; I used to go in the morning to my laboratory , wash my own glassware so that I knew that it was clean , do a precise , accurate , satisfying experiment . . . Now a team of girls washes my apparatus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have to keep my assistants busy , so never have time to do an experiment myself . ' " <P> How to Tell a Harvard Man . " The approach to teaching in most medical schools in America is essentially by emphasis on what is not known rather than what is known in medicine . At Harvard , for example , a student may be shown a case . . . that can not apparently be explained ... He is asked to go to the library and come back with the answer . . . The teacher , to gain respect , must find the flaw in the student 's argument , generally on a point of logic rather than of fact . When teaching at Harvard , it is usually a mistake to be too dogmatic , for a student is all too likely to prove you wrong . It is much better to pursue the Socratic method of posing impossible questions which you can not answer yourself . . . <P> " Compared with ours the U.S. medical student is older , more mature-having wasted three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun in earnest ; he no longer plays any games ; he feels himself one of a privileged few , lucky to have got in ; and , above all , like all Americans , he is interested in things that are new . It must be admitted that , just now and then , preoccupation with the new leads to too little attention to old and tried principles ; nevertheless it is thus that medicine in America is dynamic , not static .
