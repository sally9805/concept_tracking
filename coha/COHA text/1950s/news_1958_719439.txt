txt ATLAS ICBM TEST AGAIN A SUCCESS Missile Fired Over Limited Range  --  Navaho Also Shot at Cape Canaveral Base By BIIII/SON BRACH= Specisl Tb New York COCOA BEACH , Fla. , Jan. 10 ? Another Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile was successfully test-fired over a limited range from Cape Canaveral thin morning . Like the first successful Atlas on Dec. 17 , today 's giant rocket was deliberately held to a range of between 500 and 900 miles . The missile has a potential range of 5,500 miles . The difference in the tests was primarily one of flight data received . Telemetric ( radio ) facilities can " ask " an Atlas speeding toward its target about 300 questions . An official of Convair-Astronautics , prime contractor on the Atlas , explained that the questions asked today , relating both to the internal functioning of the $2,000,000 rocket and the external conditions it had encountered , were for the most part different from those asked in December . Navaho Tested Later Continuing the stepped-up program that began after the failure of the satellite-bearing Vanguard on Dec. 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully fired a Navaho . This was described as a routine test of a surplus unit of a canceled program . The Navaho is a surface-to-surface intercontinental missile with an approximate range of 5,500 miles . However , it is an aerodynamic ( winged ) rather than a ballistic ( projectile shaped ) missile . It is rocket-launched but " breathes " oxygen from the atmosphere rather than carrying it high above the atmosphere in the form of liquid oxygen . The Navaho is powered by ramjets  --  compressing its air directly by its high-speed passage . This is in contrast to a turbojet in which an inner turbine does the compressing . Useful Data Expected The test center emphasized that today 's firing in no way had affected the cancellation of the Navaho program . It indicated , however , that useful data bearing on other aspects of the over-all program might be obtained by firing one of the leftover vehicles . By a series of tests like this morning 's involving the Atlas , the test center hopes to perfect the ICBM for eventual flights covering its full range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Department of Defense said : " The Atlas ICBM was test // fired today on the missile test range , Cape Canaveral , Fla . The launching was successfully carried out at 10:48 A.M. This test of the Atlas , under development by the Air Force and Convair , is one of a series of IRBM ( intermediate range ballistic missiles ) and ICBM flights eonducted at the Canaveral range . The test , which was not full range , was successful . " As usual , the firing of a big missile sent a wave of excitement over the Canaveral area and word of the success of the Atlas test put smiles on the faces of nearly everyone in this missile-conscious community . Two New York tourists , en route home from a freezing Florida vacation , stopped off at the south beach of Port Canaveral , built a fire and waited from about 9 A. M. They were Louis Feldman , an insurance man , of 10 Sheridan Square , and his wife , Peggy . The red canvas ball that traditionally signals that a test is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it was lowered an hour later . Like scores of more experienced " birdwatchers , " the Feldmans regretfully started back to their motel . But they stopped off at a beach point a little farther away . The ball stayed down , but at 10:48 there was an enormous burst of steam from one of the distant Atlas pads and someone gasped , " There it goes . " After the usual breathless moments of seeming uncertainty  --  actually wholly normal , because the ninety-ton vehicle is accelerating vertically from zero velocity  --  the Atlas pushed skyward , its golden jet seething beneath it . The Quiet Is Shattered Through a slightly hazed gray-blue sky , the rocket speeded up , arching gently toward the down-range tracking stations to the southeast . As it flattened out , the missile 's laggard sound caught up and shattered the morning quiet . A cottony vapor trail spread out behind . Then it was gone like a golden spark that has flickered out . Mrs. Feldman said : " I was so excited I did n't know what to do first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down like a little boy . " Meanwhile , in the deepest concrete blockhouse on the cape the experts were reacting happily too . One of them was Karel J. L. Bossart , technical director for Convair and designer of the Atlas . Mr. Bossart , born in Belgium , now a United States citizen , had not been here for last month 's test . The matter of the lowered red ball , while not in the same category of significance as the successful launching , nevertheless was of great interest and some controversy in this area . As explained by diagram in the standard brochure of the test center , a ball is raised on each of two ninety-foot poles on opposite sides of the cape when a test is in progress . This is primarily to warn shrimp boats and fishing craft to stay outside a five-mile zone . Louis Fischer of Cocoa , a leader in the shrimp industry , said today the shrimpers " definitely do go by it " ? that is , govern their course according to whether the ball is up or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing had been " not too good today , but that some boats definitely had been out when the ball was lowered . Maj. Gen. Donald N. Yates , commanding the test center , this evening explained that the lowering of the ball indicated a modification in , the warning system to tighten security . After the danger zone had been cleared and " all concerned warned , " General Yates added , the ball was lowered " as planned  --  to preclude alerting unauthorized persons . " There was no explanation as to what would keep a " warned " craft from cruising back on the danger zone when its skipper saw the ball go down . But it was announced at Patrick Air Force Base , administrative headquarters of the center , that the General would at a Monday news conference discuss the " red ball and other pertinent items . " It was learned that the General had been seriously concerned about advance stories forecasting another Atlas firing for this morning . The security and public relations aspects of the Cape operation may reach a new point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another attempt will be made to put a satellite aloft lin a Vanguard rocket . Air Force spokesmen here referred queries as to why the Navaho program had been canceled to Washington . But it was understood that a contributing factor was the fact that the Navaho 's speed is only between 11,000 and 1,400 miles an hour . It could thus be overtaken by Ijet planes .. The prime contractor was North American .
