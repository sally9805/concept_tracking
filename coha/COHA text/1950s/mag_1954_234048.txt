" I love Ruth Draper , " wrote Henry Adams to a friend . " She is a little genius and quite fascinates me . " When Adams wrote in 1911 , the 26-year-old actress was still an amateur , reciting in people 's drawing rooms . Then , as always , she created her own material ; only once in her life appearing in a play , Ruth Draper at length became the most finished of professionals , without exhibiting the vices and vulgarities of professionalism . Thus , she has never sought in her sketches to keep up with the times , and so has never fallen behind them . <P> Last week Ruth Draper , 69 , began a " farewell Broadway engagement " - while remarking that " the farewell engagement is a standing joke in the business . " All the same , it was a reminder that an irreplaceable theater figure would not be an eternal one . Ruth Draper has soundly insisted that she is no mere monologist or diseuse ; she describes herself as a character actress . In any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent the character she is portraying . And with amazing , quick changes , she can be a featherbrained society woman , a bewildered immigrant , a spare , porch-sitting down-easter , a whole international procession of visitors to an Italian church . <P> Yet if she has sternly suppressed her own personality , she everywhere gives proof of her very personal taste and wit : with a resolute aristocracy of method , she is as much above her characters as she is outside them . If her finest talent is for social comedy , her particular genius is for suggesting a stageful of people , a whole social scene .
