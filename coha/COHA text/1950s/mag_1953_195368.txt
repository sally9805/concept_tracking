At his sixth press conference , the President again made a lot of news-enough to give the New York Times nine major stories from the conference . Samples : <P> A reporter 's request for an analysis of the Communist peace offensive got a reply that disclosed the Administration 's attitude toward the new Communist peace offensive . Without forgetting past history , the President said , the U.S. Government should take at face value every offer , until it is proved unworthy ( see above ) . <P> The President answered mildly and clearly a storm of provocative questions about the McCarthy affair ( see below ) . <P> Ike quickly scotched a report that he would leave the cutting of U.S. combat strength to Secretary Wilson . The size of our armed forces , he said , would conform with what he always goes back to-George Washington 's old precept of a reasonable posture of military defense . The responsibility for cutting would not be one that he would delegate . <P> Reciprocal trade agreements are being re-examined carefully , the President said , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favored extension of the agreements for one year . <P> Newshen May Craig was worried about the Government 's huge surplus butter stores ( TIME , April 6 ) , and Ike indicated that he was worried too . He hoped that Congress would give him the responsibility for finding outlets for the butter before it spoils . It would be a crime to civilization and to ourselves , he added , to allow it to spoil . He could n't imagine anything worse when people are hungry . <P> A query about Republican prospects in 1954 drew a smile and a quick reply from the President . It is just as simple as looking at the palm of your hand , he said . If the Republican Party can show as its record over the next two years a progressive , sane program of accomplishment , which takes care of the welfare and interest of all our people and does n't give itself away to any group or class , and if that program is properly advertised , the G.O.P. will be back with a very greatly enhanced majority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
