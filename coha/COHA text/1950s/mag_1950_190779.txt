Germany 's Russian-zone Communists this week staged one of the most successful Hitler-style ja elections in history . Citizens were free to vote either ja or nein to a single list of candidates . They were free to vote out in the open where Communist checkers could see them , or to go into a polling booth . Catch was that Communist election workers noted the names of all who used the polling booths . Fearing Communist reprisals , nearly all East Germans voted out in the open and voted ja . <P> The results were not surprising . Less than 24 hours after the election , the Soviet East-zone radio announced that of 12,331,905 eligible to vote , 98.4% cast their ballot . Of these , 12,088,745 voted for the official list and only 35,544 voted nein . <P> West Berlin 's smart antiCommunists , meanwhile , thought up a way to show how little the rigged election represented the real sentiments of East Germans . The West Berliners invited East Berliners to protest against the election by mailing to a West Berlin headquarters the stubs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 400,000 stubs had poured in , out of a possible 700,000 or so votes in East Berlin . <P> Another Western device for exposing Communist tyranny was brilliantly successful last week . The West Berlin Publishers ' Association erected on the Potsdamer-Platz a crude copy of the N.Y . Times electric news sign . The sign was in the British sector but it faced the Russian sector . Hundreds of East Berliners gathered across the Potsdamer-Platz to read unadulterated news . Enraged Communists turned fire hoses on the sign , then tried vainly to blot it out with strong searchlights . East Berliners went right on looking at the news . Sample bulletin : " Chancellor Konrad Adenauer labels Soviet-zone elections a fraud . "
