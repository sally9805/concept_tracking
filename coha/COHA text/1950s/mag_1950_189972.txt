AMERICA BEGINS ( 438 pp. ) - Edited by Richard M. Dorson-Pantheon ( $4.50 ) . <P> <P> One day in the early 1600s , a certain gentleman of Jamestown murdered his wife , cut her in pieces and later " was burned for his horrible villainy . " In Carolina , a horn snake struck at a small locust tree the thickness of a man 's arm , and six hours later the tree was dead . Farther north , some Indians buried a white man , standing , with only his head above ground , scalped him and lit a fire close by . The heat made his brains boil and started his eyes gushing out of their sockets . In Casco Bay , Me. , a merman tried to board a hunter 's boat , had a " hand chopped off and sank , purpling the water with his inhuman blood . <P> American history ( and legend ) had begun . Few Americans , of course , had the wit to recognize it in the making . Yet here &; there a quick eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich , small doings of 17th Century American life . These early histories , diaries , memoirs and letters , vivid scribbles on the cuff of history , have mostly been suppressed into the dreary , quoteless grey of the professional historian 's page . America Begins gives a glimpse of the real wonderland behind that dingy looking glass . <P> Liquor by the Mouthful . Editor Dorson has searched through records of the colonial century for its sharpest incidents , sharpened them still further with careful editing , and made of them a volume that brings the colonial century almost too keenly alive for some 20th Century tastes . The tales of Indian captivity , in particular , are about as easy to take as a tomahawk in the skull : babies bashed to death against trees , a prisoner ripped in half by the main force of some 20 of his captors , another with thumbs cut off and a sharp stake driven up his arm to the elbow ; the torture of famed Jesuit Father Jogues , who was later massacred with his party . <P> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was turned to the Indians . One John Lawson records how the Indians bought their liquor-by the mouthful . " And for this purpose the buyer always makes choice of his man , which is one that has the greatest mouth , whom he brings to the market with a bowl " to spit the liquor in . " The seller looks narrowly to the man 's mouth that measures it , and if he happens to swallow any down . . . the merchant . . . does not scruple to knock the fellow down . . . Thereupon the buyer finds another mouthpiece . . . " <P> The Devil 's Children . The colonists had plenty else to concern them besides the Indians . In New England , especially , the Devil made trouble . " Exhibiting himself ordinarily as a small black man , " says that great theological gossip , Cotton Mather , the fiend " decoyed a fearful knot of proud , froward , ignorant , envious , and malicious creatures to lift themselves in his horrid service . . . " <P> Yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine sallies of Yankee humor . One of them is an ancestor of a long posterity of country-bumpkin v. city-slicker witsnappers that pass current to this day . <P> " I 'll tell you , son , " one early Bostonian informed " an honest , ingenious countryman " with pompous condescension , " the Devil is dead . " <P> " Well , then , " said the countryman , " if he be dead , he hath left many fatherless children in Boston . "
