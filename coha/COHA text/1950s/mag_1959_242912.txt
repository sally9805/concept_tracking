Only a few weeks before , Iraq 's Premier Abdel Karim Kassem had been the nation 's idol , but now the mention of his name drew sneers as well as applause from Baghdad crowds . As his tan Chevrolet station wagon rolled past the coffee shops on teeming Rashid Street , some coffee drinkers propped their legs on the caf tables to show Kassem the soles of their feet-an Arab gesture of contempt . Demonstrators protesting last month 's execution of 13 popular Iraqi army officers ( TIME , Sept. 28 ) even dared to chant : " Allah is great , Kassem is crazy . " In the sultry heat of Baghdad , many an old Mideast hand could smell trouble . <P> It came one evening last week with the suddenness of lightning as Kassem 's car took him along the accustomed route through Rashid Street . As usual , little knots of surprised pedestrians stopped to wave or cheer , and some trotted in the dusty street hoping for a peek at the " sole leader . " Then , from the sidewalk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opened fire with a deafening clatter . A youth broke out of the startled crowd to hurl himself in front of Kassem as a shield , and a taxi driver rammed his cab between Kassem 's station wagon and the gunmen . But it was too late ; Kassem 's driver lay dead , and the Premier himself was reeling and bloodied , his hand ripped by one submachine gun slug , his arm shattered by two more . He had escaped death by inches . <P> The Swarthy One . Before the dust settled , the assailants had melted into the crowd and vanished with a practiced finesse that befitted their leader , a swarthy professional assassin who has been killing for hire for more than 20 years . A shadowy Palestinian once employed by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem , Kassem 's would-be killer , who is well known to the police , counts among his coups the shooting of an Arab sheik who had agreed to sell land to Jews and the murder of a British official on the steps of a church in Nazareth . Barred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from Syria as scores of other terrorists have been doing in recent months , and just as efficiently made his getaway . <P> In Cairo , Gamal Abdel Nasser was quick to raise his hands in horror at the news of the attack on Kassem ( " I am against all this terror and killing " ) , but many guessed that he was just making a show of propriety . The United Arab Republic 's campaign to topple Kassem has reached a screaming crescendo ; fortnight ago Syria 's tough Interior Minister , Colonel Abdel Hamid Serraj , presided at a clandestine meeting in the Syrian town of El Haseke with anti-Kassem Iraqi army officers to discuss plans for Iraq 's leadership should Kassem be overthrown . When the meeting was over , Serraj flew off to Cairo immediately to report to Nasser .
