txt BERLIN , May ** United States will continue to give maximum aid to Western Berlin until it has attained a " free life " and has joined a united city and united Germany , W. Averell tHarriman , Marshall Plan AmI bassador , declared here today . Mr. Harriman 's statement at a press conference emphasized the intention of the United States , Britain and France to continue to give the , Western sectors of this city every assistance , economic , political and military , necessary to forestall Soviet plans for a mass invasion of the Western sectors May 28 by members of the Free German Youth movement . Accelerated by reports of the growing strength of this movement in various parts of the three Western sectors and unimpressed by the restraint shown by the " people 's police " and Free German Youth during the May Day celebrations yesterday , the Western powers are completing their plans to check the Communists later this month . They are also arranging to deal with any demonstrations May 8 , on which date the Russians are asking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , of course , is the fifth anniversary of the complete defeat of the German people . Although the West is now strong enough  --  and will be stronger  --  to deal with any " invasion " of the Western sectors , there is growing apprehension about the fifth col ' umn of Communist adherents in those sectors. - , Free German Youth cells are growing in Neukoelln , Wedding and Kreuzberg . These cells are not dangerous in themselves . But if their members take part actively in the events of May 28 they may divert the police and troops from other and more important sectors . These successes in this uneasy city are balanced by reports from the Soviet zone that show that Western Allies ' statements that the young people invading the // Western sectors May 28 will encounter trouble are having the desired effect . This correspondent learned from a trustworthy source that in one East zone high school where all boys had been " invited " to participate in the May 28 rally , authorities had drawn a blank the first time . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as excuses for non-attendance . Six Students Forced to Attend Finally , it was agreed , under pressure from school authorities , that six of the student body would have to attend . The Communists are making a great deal of the " youth formations " that appeared in the Lustgarten at yesterday 's Communist festival and the absence of organized youth at the Western Berlin demonstration . Undeniably many of those who marched , in the Communist ranks displayed an esprit de corps and corporate spirit . But there were a number of others who appeared to . be just going through the motions . On the Western side , the youths were not confined by party discipline . But on the whole the demonstration impressed this observer , as more serious than its counterpart in the Eastern sector . The young Western Berliners in the Platz der Republik seemed to have a quality of endurance lacking in the brittle demonstrations in the Lustgarten . Although danger lies ahead , the balance is in favor of the West . The political spirit exhibited yesterday is bolstered by an economic improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western ' sectors recently and 100,000 will ibe re-employed by July 1 , Mr. ' Harriman said . The Ambassador also pointed out that while the Russians continued Ito raise barriers to communications between East and West Germany the Western Allies were discussing the " improvement of freight and passenger services by air . " In promising this and other measures to keep trade flowing between Western Berlin and the West German Republic , Mr. Harriman declared the people of Western Berlin had " shown their will to maintain freedom and develop a free life " and the United States " believes in them and their ultimate success . " Mr. Harriman declared that Western Berlin was " an integral part of Western Germany " and that the United States hoped to see it take its place in Western Germany soon . This statement stressed the efforts that the Office of the United States High Commissioner had been making to win French approval for the incorporation of Western Berlin into the West German Republic before the May 28 Communist demonstration .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
