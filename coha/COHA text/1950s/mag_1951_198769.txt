Two towns 20 miles apart on the southernmost tip of Texas got different versions of TIME 'S Aug. 20 issue . In Harlingen , 240 subscribers received a magazine in which the Press section contained stories on the Cincinnati Post 's crusade against municipal graft and a sketch on the Vatican daily , L'Osservatore Romano . In nearby Raymondville , county seat of Willacy County , 70 subscribers got copies in which the Press section reported the life &; death of Press Lord William RandolphHearst. *The difference represented the kind of magazine reporting made possible when the best in highspeed communication and printing equipment backs up a crack journalistic team . <P> Here is what happened . When Publisher Hearst died Tuesday the TIME presses in Chicago , Philadelphia and Los Angeles were clicking out 70,000 copies an hour . As fast as the early-run magazines rolled off , they were bundled into trucks and trains for distant points . Since Hearst 's death , a major news event , was reported before a quarter of TIME 'S U.S. distribution was on its way to readers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York offices looked a little like a city room putting out an extra as the staff , breaking into their Tuesday-Wednesday weekend , converged on the building . The basic story had been written for some time , but it needed updating and final editing . The Los Angeles bureau was on the wire most of the afternoon , flashed in late news from Beverly Hills , checked last-minute points on the Hearst empire . <P> About dinnertime the first copy went out on the teletypesetter in New York and soon was automatically turning into linotype metal at all three printing plants . New plates went on the battery of presses that had been standing by . As presses roared to life again , TIME distribution men , old hands at such emergencies , rerouted bundles of copies on later trains and trucks , put some on planes . Only a few readers got their copies late . <P> Cordially yours , <P> <P> *Harlingen subscribers or any of the other 450,000 readers who got the early edition can get TIME 'S story on Newsman Hearst by writing to me.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
