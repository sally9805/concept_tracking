txt SALT LAKE CITY , Oct. 18 ? Representative Douglas R. Stringfellow , Republican of Utah , whose purported record as a World War II " cloak and dag-. ger " hero was exposed last week as a fabrication of his imagination , withdrew today as a candidate for re-election . The Republican State Central Committee later tonight voted to accept his resignation as a candidate in Utah 's First Congressional District .. The committee then voted , 73 to 19 , to nominate as a substitute candidate Dr. Henry Aldous Dixon , president of Utah State Agricultural College at Logan . Dr. Dixon , 62 years old , became president of the college two years ago after twenty years as head of Weber College at Ogden . Dr. Dixon , who was at his son 's home in Ogden , reluctantly accepted the nomination after a half-hour 's telephone conference with state party leaders . There was extensive conjecture that the developments might cost the G. 0 . P. a needed seat in the House of Representatives . The district , comprising all of Utah except Salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in many years in 1952 , seemingly to a considerable extent on the basis of Mr. Stringfellow 's appeal as a war hero . The Democratic candidate in the district is Walter K. Granger , who held the seat from 1940 to 1952 , when he ran unsuccessfully for the Senate // against Senator Arthur V. Watkins . There are no conspicuously strong potential Republican candidates in the district for such a short contest period . There was some speculation , however , that the Republican substitute might draw a significant vote based , on sympathy for Mr. Stringfellow . The 32-year-old Ogden war veteran , who became entangled in three years ' enibroidory of his record , actually was crippled by a mine explosion in France . The consensus Was , however , that the affair had ' turned the . First District race from virtually a sure thing for the Republicans to a questionable proposition . It also was thought that it might have an adverse effect in the Second District , where the Republican incumbent , Representative William A. Dawson , already had a fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bosone. 100 Members Present The state committee acted on Mr. Stringfellow 's resignation with about 100 of its 128 voting members present . There was no debate . A few moments after the vote , , Mr. Stringfellow , accompanied by his wife , entered the room and was invited to the rostrum . He , prayed silently for a moment and then , his voice breaking intermittently , thanked the gathering . " Your action here tonight is in keeping with the best traditions of the Republican party , " he said . " I realize I have placed the chances of the party in jeopardy in the coming election * " " Many questions have been asked  --  why Stringfellow did n't come clean sooner , why Stringfellow did n't do this or that . I just did n't have the courage . I just could n't find the way . But oh a recent trip , on bended knee , I found the courage and the way . In your presence I 'd like to apologize to you for anything I did wrong * * * , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a great cause and that we have a most wonderful President and a legislative program that is sound . I hope the people will vote their honest convictions , I leave you with my best wishes and humble apologies . My wife and I have had some difficult hours , but our friends have stood by us. * " " I realize many of you wanted to do what was right with Stringfellow . But the question was what was right . God bless you for your courage and forthright action . " Then , walking as usual with difficulty with the aid of cane and braces , he hobbled from the meeting room in the Newhouse Hotel . He Denies Any Pressure His earlier announcement today on his resignation said : " In keeping with the spirit of the statement I issued to . the press and read to a wide television audience Saturday , I have today submitted to the Secretary of State my resignation as Republican candidate for re-election to the House of Representatives , representing Utah 's First Congressional District . " There has been no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I shall willingly accept the decision of the party officials as to whether or not this resignation is in order , but after long and serious thought -I am of the opinion that my State , my party and all concerned would be better served if this resignation is accepted . " I ask my friends and supporters throughout the First District to abide in the same spirit with my decision . " No member of my staff was at any time aware of the true story of my war record . The staff accepted my version complete- , believing in me to the last . I , and I alone , bear complete responsibility for these fabrications . I sincerely hope that no reflections will be made upon any member of my staff or those connected with my campaign . " Will Serve Out erm Representative Stringfellow did not indicate that he was resigning from the House for the remaining two months of his term . This seemed to be considered a superfluous gesture that would only aggravate Republican embarrassment , since his tenure would be an academic matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House might be called . ? Mr. Stringfellow said in the television broadcast Saturday night , in which he confessed his hoax , that he would leave his future up to the state G. O. P. committee . However , over the week-end an initial wave of sympathy for his plight turned quickly into the feeling that he had put his fitness for office under a cloud , and that his record was not one the electorate should be asked to ratify . One pronounced vein of , sentiment in Ogden , among life-long friends and acquaintances , was that while he should be accorded every sympathy and assistance in re-establishing himself locally , it should be as a private citizen . The majority of Utah 's residents , including Representative Stringfellow , are members of the Church of Jeeus Christ of Latter Day Saints and heed its , counsels in the secular field . It has strong influence in Republican party councils . The church 's voice thundered at noon today  --  about the time Representative Stringfellow announced his withdrawal  --  in * editorial in its principal orgah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This said : " Douglas Stringfellow is a member of a society that knows that truth is eternal and will not remain forever hidden .

Papers Ask Withdrawal " There can : be no thought of his continuing to be the Republican candidate for Congress . * * * The last mistake in. a long series of mistakes Mr. Stringfellow made was at first to attempt to pass to the Republican State Committee the responsibility for deciding whether he should cons tinue to run . Later , he wisely decided to shoulder that responsibility for himself . * * * All other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the sort of man the people of Utah want to represent their great state .
