txt We are witnessing a strange political campaign in New York State , Although nominated by the Democrats to succeed himself as . Governor , Averell Harriman seems to be running mostly against President Eisenhower , with occasional sallies against the Republican candidate for Governor of California , William Knowland , and the Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York , Malcolm Wilson . On state issues , to which Nelson A. Rockefeller has ? faithfully confined himself , the Republican nominee for Governor finds himself debating an opponent who is n't there . Mr. Harriman has attacked Mr. Rockefeller for " failing to express himself on national affairs . " He sees a " new form of isolationism " in Mr. Rockefeller 's refusal to debate anything but state issues . He thinks his opponent should be " disqualified " as an aspirant for Governor for this insistence on state issues . Thus Mr. Harriman , it seems , in his view should be re-elected because he is against the national immigration law , because there has been an " Eisenhower " recession , because Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-to-work " laws , because Mr. Rockefeller is a " sham and a fraud " for not denouncing Senator Knowland ( although Mr. Rockefeller has expressed opposition to " right-to-work " laws ) , because of Eisenhower " tight money " and " restricted credit " economic policies , because of Eisenhower rising living costs , because of Eisenhower anti-housing policy , because President Eisenhower has not spent enough time on . the job . So Governor Harriman will , perhaps , excuse the voters for being bewildered when he challenges Mr , Rockefeller to " begin to talk about the real issues . " Does he mean in Washington , in California , or here ? And what does he mean when he complains that Mr. Rockefeller " has n't told us yet where he stands on any of the important problems " ? The question of what topics are relevant to the campaign for the Governorship comes up most insistently as terms for a face-to-face debate by the candidates are themselves debated . Mr. Rockefeller believes that such a debate stick to state issues . " I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . The voters are choosing a Governor , not a President . " I am running for state office , and I am not running for a national office . " This seems to us a reasonable position . People may not be fully satisfied with the degree of specification in Mr. Rockefeller 's discussion of policy program for dealing with state problems , but at least he is talking about the real state issues , and serious ones they are . Mr. Harriman occa:sibiially ventures into a discussion of state matters , usually by way of rebuttal , but his major interest plainly lies elsewhere . Has he something new to offer in the way of program for a second term ? If not , what of the past program does he plan to return to ? If he refuses , as he says , to make many campaign promises , and wishes to be iaosen on the basis of his record , then should he not begin to talk more about the record ? With one candidate talking about state issues and the other talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compare apples and oranges : By all means let us have a debate on the " real , " the New York , issues and not isolate them out of the campaign .
