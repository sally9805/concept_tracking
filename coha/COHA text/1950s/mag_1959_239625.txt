" Today our technology has brought a chaos . We have speed , traffic , fear , congestion and restlessness . We need a place to put our lives in balance . Architecture is a good place for this . When people go into good buildings , there should be serenity and delight . " <P> This is the credo of Minoru Yamasaki , who at 46 is turning out some of the gayest and most graceful buildings in the U.S. In recognition of Yamasaki 's growing stature among U.S. architects , the Detroit Institute of Arts will open next week a full-scale show of his past works and future projects , timed to coincide with the dedication of Yamasaki 's newest building - the Detroit headquarters of Reynolds Metals Co . Though its grille of gold anodized aluminum owes an unabashed debt to Architect Ed Stone , the Reynolds building , on a 4-acre plot in a suburb just north of Detroit , epitomizes Yamasaki 's ideals of serenity and delight . Aluminum-clad columns lift it above a pond filled with water lilies . Employees will cross the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in moments of leisure they can sit or stroll beside it beneath the shadowed arcade provided by the overhanging second floor . A glass skylight lined with aluminum ribbing protrudes from the concrete roof , projects a variety of light patterns on the inner court below . <P> Jaundiced Eye . It took Detroit and the U.S. a long time to recognize Yamasaki , as it took Yamasaki a long time to find himself . Born in Seattle , he shared the indignities common to Japanese Americans . But he had a burning desire , inspired by an architect uncle , to become an architect . After getting his degree in architecture from the University of Washington , he went East to New York , struggled through a long apprenticeship working as a draftsman , waited out the animosity of the war years , in 1945 landed a job with a firm in Detroit , where he stayed . Steady progress led to his first partnership , to his St. Louis airport building , with its lofty barrel vaults of shell concrete ( TIME , April 16 , 1956 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal case of ulcers . <P> Yamasaki took advantage of a long convalescence to go to Japan . He was captivated by what he saw in its architecture : the interplay of light and shadow , the union of building and garden . He came back to cast a jaundiced eye on the serried ranks of glass boxes rising along the main streets of Manhattan and other major cities . " Our life gives promise of being spent in look-alike houses , look-alike automobiles and look-alike buildings , " he warned his fellow architects . <P> He began to turn out plans for buildings whose distinguishing features are precast concrete coaxed into graceful curves and lacelike delicacy , a box-shaped podium for a base , a surrounding pool , a gemlike skylight . " In our buildings , ' ' says Yamasaki , " we try to think of what happens to a human being as he goes from space to space , and to provide the delight of change and surprise for him .
