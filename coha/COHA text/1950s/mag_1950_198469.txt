After some seven years as a world celebrity , Frankie Sinatra at last found time for a personal appearance at London 's famed Palladium . By last week , British bobby-soxers had given him the standard , screaming welcome , and senior British critics were chewing their whiskers , trying to figure out just what Frankie has . <P> People who simply put Frankie down as " The Voice " are missing the point , wrote Sunday Timesman Harold Hobson . It is not The Voice , but " The Smile , that does such enormous , such legendary execution ... the shy , deprecating smile , with the quiver at the corner of the mouth , that makes the young ladies in the gallery swoon in ecstasy , and the maturer matrons in the dress circle gurgle with protective delight . " <P> Considering that Frankie came from the U.S. , the quality of this smile was enough to make a critic marvel . Marveled Hobson : <P> " Here is an artist who , hailing from the most amiably rowdy and self-confident community the world has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never be wholly driven out of the boast-fullest heart . To a people whose ideal of manhood is husky , full-blooded and self-reliant , he has chosen to suggest that , under the ... crashing self-assertion , man is still only a child , frightened and whimpering in the dark .
