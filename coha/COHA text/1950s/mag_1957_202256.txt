Convicted last week on 31 counts of contempt of Congress : horse-loving , track-following , fast-living Frank Brewster , boss of the eleven-state Western Conference of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters . Brewster refused to answer questions put to him last January by the Senate Permanent Investigations Subcommittee because , said his lawyers , the committee was exceeding its authority . Moreover , they argued , he had purged himself by answering later before the labor-investigating McClellan committee . Federal District Judge John J. Sirica disagreed on both points . Maximum possible sentence on each of the 31 contempt counts : one year in jail and a $1,000 fine .
