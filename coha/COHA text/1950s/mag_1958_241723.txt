Over the past year , some Britons have said some harsh public things about their Queen . In their opinion , Elizabeth was too " aloof " ; her stilted speechmaking was " a pain in the neck . " Neither Queen nor court made any reply . Last week the time came for the monarch 's Christmas Day broadcast , and for the first time , the speech was televised . It was the Queen 's first personal TV appearance in Britain , and she went to great pains to prove her critics wrong . <P> The Christmas Day broadcasts are firmly lodged in royal tradition , running back to 1932 , when George V sat down before a microphone at Sandringham House , and - though he confessed that it all but spoiled his day - became the first British monarch to . speak ( " from my home and from my heart . . . to men and women so cut off by the snows , the desert or the sea , that only voices out of the air can reach them " ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VI insisted on making the broadcast even while wasting away after the removal of a lung , painfully recording a phrase or two at a time in an agonizing ordeal that took two days . <P> Double Ditches . For his daughter , last week 's ordeal was more protracted than painful . Preparations had taken weeks . Two ditches , each two miles long , were gouged through the velvety lawns and underbrush of the 7,000-acre estate to carry the cables needed for TV cameras . The Queen herself watched , over and over , a training film starring bright-eyed , pretty Sylvia Peters , one of BBC 's ablest announcers , in which Sylvia demonstrated the five best ways of making a TV speech : 1 ) from memory , 2 ) from notes , 3 ) using a Teleprompter , 4 ) combining notes and Teleprompter , 5 ) reading it in its entirety . The Queen selected No. 4 . She wrote the speech herself , and her draft was care fully edited to eliminate clichs and pompous phrases . <P> A makeup artist arrived at Sandringham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face powder and eye shadow . Homey touches abounded : a shelf behind Elizabeth 's chair bristled with Christmas cards ; a large photo of nine-year-old Prince Charles and seven-year-old Princess Anne stood at the Queen 's elbow . Wearing a brocaded afternoon dress , the Queen was positioned at her oak desk , sitting sideways from it so that she faced directly into the camera and into the eyes of an estimated 50 million viewers in Great Britain and on the Continent . <P> These Old Islands . The red light flashed and the Queen began her speech : " It is inevitable that I should seem a rather remote figure to you . . . but now , at least for a few minutes , I welcome you to the peace of my home . " Many viewers thought she was speaking indirectly to her critics when she added that today " . . . unthinking people . . . carelessly throw away ageless ideals as if they were old and outworn machinery .
