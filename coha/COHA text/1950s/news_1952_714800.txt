txt Two teen-age boys who thought it . would be cowardly to shoot a man sitting on a bench , but who agreed that a stroller with his back to them was fair game , were charged with homicide yesterday in the slaying of Samuel Bernard London , Brooklyn graduate rabbinical student , in McCarren Park on the night of June 26 . The two were trapped when a Rockaway-Beach shooting gallery attendant tipped the police that they had offered to sell a .22 caliber rifle for $3 . The boys are : Donald Ferrick , 17 years old and sturdily built , who ran away from his parents ' home at 594 Morgan Avenue , Greenpoint , on their twentieth anniversary three weeks ago and has been sleeping in parks and cellars ever since . Kings County District Attorney Miles F. said it was Ferrick who fired the single shot that killed the 23-year-old scholar . Edward Baldwin , 16 , a slim , sensitive-appearing youngster with tousled brown hair , who has a record of automobile thievery . His address was given as 4151 Paulding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his friendship with Ferrick was traced to Baldwin 's stay at Lincoln Hall , a ' home for delinquents at Lincoln- ' dale , N. Y. Ferrick had not been ' there , but he had heard a lot about it , What might have been a casual acquaintance with the younger boy became a much closer , competitive relationship , based largely on the fact that Ferrick was impressed by Baldwin 's having been " sent up " without being softened . On June 26 , according to the District Attorney , the boys found the opportunity they sought to impress each other further . For $3 they bought a rifle from another youngster - officially unnamed - in the spreenpoint section . That was easy enough , but at a near-by sporting goods store a clerk refused to sell them a box of fifty cartridges on the ground that they were not 18 . The boys withdrew , did some whispering , then returned to the counter . ' " Would it be O. K. if an older person bought them ? " Ferrick asked . The clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a movie entrance asking the first adult to " Take me in , Mister . " The difference was that this time the first man who came along bought them not tickets but bullets . Without revealing the name of the store , Mr. . interpolated that " this may highlight the need for legislation to prevent the sale of guns and ammunition to juveniles ; it shows how easy it is for kids under 18 to purchase this kind of ammunition . " With the rifle loaded , the boys spent the rest of the day figuring out how to use it . They considered Various types of hold-up . Once a candy store was in mind . They finally decided that would be " chicken " ? kid stuff . As the hot night came on they were stalking in McCarren Park . They sized up a man on a bench , but decided that would be " chicken " too ; each boy was obsessed with a fear of not appearing bold enough to suit the other . So the unknown bench-warmer escaped . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he had said memorial prayers for his mother , strolled by in the leafy stillness , he became the target , just because he was moving . Ferrick tripped while kneeling behind a shrub . The gun fell to the grass . Undeterred , the boy picked it up , aimed like a sniper and fired . The range was 40 to 50 feet . The victim fell . In sudden terror . the boys fled . For twenty days they lived with the secret and with the rifle . On Wednesday , Mrs. Anne Ferrick , Donald 's mother , thought she saw her runaway son in Winthrop Park . But he had disappeared before she could reach him . About 9 o'clock that night two boys appeared at the Rockaways Playland shooting gallery , facing Ninety-eighth Street near the ' ocean in Rockaway Beach . Bargaining Leads to Arrest A television beauty contest was going on . The breeze was full of music ; the carnival spirit ran high and at the gallery slugs crashed in their insistent pursuit of pinwheels and clay pipes . " You want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys said , obviously not seeking a profit on the deal . The gallery attendant , who asked that his name be withheld looked-them over . " Well , " he said casually . " I 'm too busy now . Come back tomorrow and we 'll see . " The boys drifted away . The attendant got in touch with PatrolI man Thomas E. Mangan of the 100th Precinct , the regular man on the beat . At 6:30 Thursday night , Patrolman Mangan hovered in shadows opposite the gallery . The boys appeared . A dismantled .22 caliber rifle was in a paper bag . The policeman stepped across and made the arrests without the slightest trouble . The story came out quickly . The boys were taken for booking to I the Herbert Street Station , an old red-brick building in Greenpoint where they were handcuffed to a horizontal bar of the grillwork guarding the windows of the Humboldt Street side . Soon six other youngsters  --  possible witnesses  --  were brought into an adjoining room . They lounged around all morning , one lying back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring up at the station radio . But Inspector William KimMins of the Brookyn East Detective District and aides cautioned that the two boys held were not members of a gang . Nor were any of the other boys held . Ferrick , his face fuzzed with golden down , wore a sport shirt ' patterned with red squares , fluted with black and white . Blue dungarees were t . cked into rubber I boots , their high tops folded down . " Raldwin , in a blue shirt , beltless gray trousers and black and white sneakers , had less stamina ; he collapsed with his head on a desk and one thin arm flung out beside it . In mid-afternoon , the boys were taken to Brooklyn Headquarters to be photographed and fingerprinted . Then , in Felony Court . Magistrate Abner Surpless held them without bail for a hearing next Thursday . The boys said nothing . They looked respectfully at the judge , but Ferrick 's fists were half-clenched . When the Court asked if their persistent nodding to routine questions meant " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to records produced at the arraignment , Baldwin had faced a charge of grand larceny involving an automobile in Queens last March , but it was dismissed . Two similar charges in the Bronx , ' possibly involving the same car , were listed as pending . Ferrick had received a suspended sentence as " a youthful offender " in a burglary case in August , 1951 . He is the son of a gas company employe . Friends of the family said he had attended St. Cecilia 's Parochial School and the Franklin K. Lane High School , but that a doctor had recommended several months ago that he have psychiatric treatment . At 172 South Third Street , Miss Shirley London , sister of the slain man , said that she and her father , Herman , were relieved that the crime had apparently been solved . " Their punishment is a matter for the law , " she said . " My brother was such a fine man ? if you only knew how fine he was . . . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
