Like an old flame who would not be jilted , RKO Pictures Corp . was back in Howard Hughes 's lap last week . For the five-man syndicate , headed by Chicago Punchboard Promoter Ralph Stolkin , which had bought Hughes 's controlling interest in RKO for $7,093,940 , it was the end of a short flirtation with moviemaking . Unable to control the company because of bad publicity about their past activities ( TIME , Oct. 27 ) , the syndicate had tried to sell the stock , but found no takers at anything like the $7 a share it had paid for it . Though it meant abandoning a $1,250,000 down payment and $100,000 in interest , the cheapest way out seemed to be to return the stock to Hughes . <P> Though richer by $1,350,000 on the deal , Hughes seemed to be getting no bargain . RKO has been losing $100,000 a week , and has made only one picture in seven months . If Hughes , who has tired of the studio , means to try to sell it again , he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week Hughes picked the man he thinks can do the job . Subject to his board 's approval , Hughes named as RKO 's new president James R. Grainger , a veteran Hollywood distributor who is sales manager of Republic Pictures . But what RKO needed most of all was someone who could get it back into making movies .
