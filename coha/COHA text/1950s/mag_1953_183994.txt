A drunkenness known as nitrogen narcosis is a factor of diving physiology . The first stage is a mild anesthesia , a gaseous attack on the central nervous system . It destroys the instinct for life . <P> - from The Silent World , <P> by Captain J. Y. Cousteau <P> All of his life , Hope Root loved the sea . A vigorous , barrel-chested ( 5 ft. 5 in. , 170 lbs . ) Miami lawyer , Root spent his spare time in or on the water , fishing , boating and swimming . Three years ago he discovered the new sport of skin diving with an Aqua-Lung . He discovered the thrill of plunging into the dark depths without the clumsy encumbrance of a diving suit , using only a mouthpiece breathing apparatus to equalize the tremendous pressures of the ocean 's silent world . Unlike Captain Cousteau , who brought the silent world on to the printed page in a 1953 bestseller ( TIME , Feb. 9 ) Root often said that he had never suffered from the nitrogen narcosis which Cousteau calls also " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the depths is much like the mountain climber 's euphoria , the exuberant dizziness that blinds the climber to danger when the supply of blood oxygen gets thin . Divers fear narcosis . One came back from a record 306 ft. down , and lived to tell about it . Another , Maurice Fargues , plunged down to 396 ft. , scribbled his name on a marker , and was pulled to the surface drowned , his Aqua-Lung mouthpiece dangling uselessly . Miami 's Skin Diver Root determined to learn more . Why take the risks ? Said 52-year-old Diver Root : " I 'm going to dive for the same reason people climb high mountains . It 's a challenge . " <P> " It 's Bad Down There . " Root 's plans for an assault on the record last week were carefully detailed . Three well-equipped boats bobbed around like corks in the turbulent Gulf Stream off Miami at the 100-fathom mark . One boat carried Root and seven other skin-diving friends who planned to station themselves at various depths along the 1/16 - in steel strand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Coast Guard cutter . In the third boat was an oceanographer of the University of Miami 's marine laboratories.The oceanographer would trace Root 's descent with echo sounding gear , just to make the record official . As an unofficial measure . Root planned to pull a marker off the cable at 430 ft. : " That 's the one I 'll have to get . " <P> The red small-craft storm-warning flags were being whipped by 25-knot gusts when one of the divers went over the side to test conditions several fathoms down . His report : " It 's bad down there . I had a hell of a time getting back . " Root was urged to postpone his descent . Placidly munching cookies and drinking coffee while almost everybody else , was seasick , Root refused to change his plans : " No , I 'm itchy about it now . And the more you wait , the more static builds up . It wo n't be rough down below . " <P> " It 's Time to Get Going . " Then Root strapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot flippers , two cylinders with enough oxygen ( under 2,200 lbs . pressure ) to last 25 minutes at 400 ft. , and two lead weights , a six-pounder to neutralize his own buoyancy , a three-pounder to aid the descent . Then , with a cheery " It 's time I got going , " Root donned his face mask and slipped over the side .
