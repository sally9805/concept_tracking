Among the foes of Freudian psychoanalysis , few are bitterer than psychologists of rival schools . A savagely outhitting example is Andrew Salter , Manhattan behaviorist and hypnotist , splenetic disciple of Ivan Petrovich Pavlov . Psychologist Salter paid his disrespects to the Freudians and set out his own pet creed in Conditioned Reflex Therapy ( TIME , Oct. 10 , 1949 ) . Now older ( 37 ) but no mellower , Salter makes another attack in The Case Against Psychoanalysis ( Holt ; $2.50 ) . <P> Salter points jeeringly at Freud 's own followers who , he says , " have become filled with doubts and are constantly reinterpreting and rewriting the Master 's gospel . There are the Jungians and the Adlerians , the Stekelites and the Reichians , the Horneyites and the Menningerites , and the so-called Washington and Chicago Schools . Great indeed is the confusion of tongues . " <P> From an old ( 1940 ) technical journal , Salter culls a case which he thinks may still be news for laymen : Psychologist Carney Landis , who underwent 221 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Landis asked his analyst , " What is normality ? " <P> " I do n't know , " the analyst replied . " I never deal with normal people . " <P> Landis persisted : " But suppose a really normal person came to you ? " <P> Admitted the analyst : " Even though he were normal at the beginning of the analysis , the analytic procedure would create a neurosis . " <P> To Psychologist Salter , the procedure of psychoanalysis is like salting a mine . " The analyst sprinkles and buries false nuggets of Oedipus , castration ( or penis envy ) and bisexuality , " he writes . " Then , as the patient digs ( where he is directed to dig ) and discovers the planted material , the analyst is convinced that he has struck pay dirt ... It is by suggestion that the patient is taught to find what he never possessed in the first place . . . Psychoanalysis can make no discoveries in the individual . It can only discover itself . " <P> " Modern psychology , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mind to be as inaccurate and wildly fanciful as the pre-Columbian maps of the New World . " And with approval he quotes Sociologist Pitirim Sorokin : " What is sound in Freudianism is very old ; what is new , very doubtful . "
