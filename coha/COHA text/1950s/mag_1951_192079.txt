Five-year-old John Muir College* at Pasadena ( enrollment : 2,000 ) has no more than the average quota of campus sin . But to Fred Phelps , 21 , a tall ( 6 ft. 3 in. ) , craggy-faced engineering student from Meridian , Miss. , John Muir is a weed-grown vineyard . Day after day this spring he has called upon his fellow students to repent . His method : to walk up to groups of boys &; girls munching their lunchtime sandwiches in the quadrangle , ask " May I say a few words ? " and launch into a talk . <P> Fred Phelps 's talks drew crowds of up to 100 . Over &; over he denounced the " sins committed on campus by students and teachers . . . promiscuous petting . evil language . . . profanity . . . cheating . . . teachers ' filthy jokes in classrooms . . . pandering to the lusts of the flesh . " Such strictures sent Dr. Archie Turrell , principal of John Muir , and most of his faculty into a slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they decided , but conceivably he was violating California 's state education code , which forbids the teaching of religion on any public school campus . <P> Something of a Martyr . A fortnight ago they ordered him to stop his campus preaching . Phelps moved across the road , off campus , and kept on preaching . Principal Turrell warned him again . " He accosted me in very stern language , " says Phelps , " and told me that he would call the law . So I told him I had no fears . If the police arrested me I would preach to them in jail . " <P> As Phelps 's audience grew , police arrived , cleared the crowded sidewalk of both the earnest and the merely curious . Phelps was " invited " into a police car and driven away from the scene ; John Muir suspended him for the rest of the week . <P> But Evangelist Fred Phelps , who had turned down an appointment to West Point to devote his life to preaching , was not to be discouraged by a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preaching from the lawn of a friendly Pasadena citizen across from the quadrangle . His audiences were bigger and more sympathetic ; in fact , Fred Phelps now had something of the attraction of a martyr . <P> Off His Stick ? Pro-Phelps students recalled that the California law against the teaching of religion has never been interpreted at John Muir as a ban on such voluntary groups as the Student Christian Association , the Roman Catholic Newman Club , the Christian Science Club , and the Mormon Deseret Club . In any case , they thought Principal Turrell had no right to pursue Phelps across the street . <P> " I do n't agree with what he says , " said a history major . " But I agree that he has a right to say it-off campus . " Said another : " I think some of us can stand a bit of revival . Maybe Phelps has got something . " <P> Students were delighted with the story that Phelps had been ordered to consult the school psychologist , a middle-aged lady , and that he had turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gloated an admiring coed : " I hope he did . They had no right to suggest that he 's off his stick . Just because you 're religious , it does n't mean you have to be crazy .
