The U.S. professor and the Danish publisher fell to talking about Anglo-Saxon manuscripts , a subject of deep interest to both . Kemp Malone , Professor of English Literature at Johns Hopkins University , confessed that he was worried . The major manuscripts in his field , said he , were few , and they led a precarious existence . Many had been exposed to fire and bombardment , and might be again . It was time , said the professor , that these documents be protected , once and for all . <P> The publisher promptly agreed , and the conversation , held in 1948 , led to an ambitious scheme.The Danish firm of Rosen-kilde &; Bagger took on the task of photostating and photographing a whole series of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts . They were to be printed in Denmark , distributed to Britain through George Allen &; Unwin and to the U.S. through the Johns Hopkins Press . The firm then asked Winston S. Churchill to be the series ' patron , hired top scholars to write special introductions . This week the first volume was ready-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Kemp Malone . <P> The Beowulf transcripts are solid proof of what the venture is about , for few valuable documents have ever had so many narrow escapes . Until 1786 , the only copy of the poem was a 1000 A.D. manuscript which for years had lain a-moldering in the library of a 16th century English collector named Sir Robert Bruce Cotton . In 1700 , Sir Robert 's descendants turned his library over to the government , but in 1731 , a good deal of it was destroyed by fire . Beowulf emerged scorched and seared - but still no one did anything to preserve what remained . <P> Icelandic Scholar Grimur Jonsson Thorkelin came to London after hearing about the manuscript by accident . Though he had no idea of its literary importance ( he was looking for historical data ) , he dutifully copied it letter by letter . His copies found their way to the Great Royal Library of Denmark . They were among the few treasures to survive the British bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807 . <P> After , next week , Beowulf scholars will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original , nor will they have to travel thousands of miles to pursue their studies of Thorkelin , whose mistakes in copying ( e.g. , 599 " d 's " for " eth " ) will still take years to untangle . But Beowulf is only the opening salvo of the new Anglo-Saxon boom . Within the next few years , scholars all over the world will have reproductions of everything from St. Gregory 's Pastoral Care to King Alfred 's translation of Orosins ' History of the World . Next volume on the list : an 8th century manuscript of Bede 's Ecclesiastical History , the original of which is now in the Leningrad Public Library , where Western scholars would have a hard time getting at it .
