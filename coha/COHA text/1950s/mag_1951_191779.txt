On the Economic Front <P> Like Communists everywhere , Red China 's rulers try to shield themselves from the view of the non-Communist world . Yet week by week ; news flows out of Red China-from the 1,500 Chinese who arrive every day in Hong Kong , from foreigners leaving the country , from letters , from Communist newspapers and radio . To sift , compare , and report this news , TIME placed Correspondent Robert Neville in Hong Kong . On this page is a week 's grist from the Hong Kong bureau 's mill . <P> Red China 's press glowed last week ( as it did almost every week ) with reports of a booming industrial economy . Rubber output in 1950 , for example , was up 13.5% . In Manchuria , the supply of consumer goods had risen 126% . And so on , in invariably mounting production percentages , but with no basic output figures . <P> Two Achievements . Propaganda aside , what has been the Communists ' economic score in almost two years ' control of most of China 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a while at least . By heavy taxation and by what amounted to capital levies , the Communists balanced the budget ; for weeks the jen min piao , or people 's banknotes , stood unusually firm at the official rate of 3,880 to $1 Hong Kong . About a month ago , however , the rate jumped on the black market to 4,600 J.M.P. to $1 Hong Kong . This 20% increase is attributed to the costs of the Korean war and the effects of the U.S. embargo on shipments of strategic goods to China . <P> Another Red success , as spectacular as Benito Mussolini 's in the ' 20s , was to make China 's trains run on time . Travelers on the Shanghai-Canton and Hankow-Canton runs also speak of clean sleeping berths , cheap , well-cooked meals , diners decorated with portraits of Stalin . The Communists have rebuilt the main lines destroyed between 1946 and 1949 , are completing such new links as the long-planned railway from Chungking to Chengtu . <P> In their occupation of Manchuria during late 1945 and early 1946 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese-built heavy industrial equipment-rolling mills , hearth furnaces , synthetic gasoline plants , steel plants , etc . Last January , Peking announced that the Russians had begun to replace some of the machinery . At about the same time , a 1951 production target rate was announced ; it will probably bring the Manchurian output to about 50% of the rate during the Japanese occupation . <P> Failures &; Competitions . In the rest of China , economic gains have been spotty . The Government 's Committee on Finance &; Economics , working toward a planned economy , has confused both private and public enterprises with its numerous decrees . Price fixing has been erratic . Taxation has been uneven . To step up output , the regime has sponsored a " Patriotic Emulation Drive , " an imitation of the Russian Stakhanovite methods . <P> Factories , mines , farms all have " model brigades " which challenge other brigades in a race of production . The Ma Heng-chang lathe brigade of machine-tool Factory No. 5 in Mukden has gained fame by reducing the time for producing a spiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yung-chin of the Fengfeng pit in Huainan colliery holds the title in his class , with 254 tons dug during a one-man shift of 6 hours .
