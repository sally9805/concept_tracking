txt A 3 billion dollar increase in individual income taxes , raising r a t es across the board for every taxpayer , was tentatively voted today by the house ways and means committee . The plan , still subject to house and senate approval , would raise the rates in each surtax bracket by 3 percentage points . That would be considerably more of an increase for most people than it may appear at first glance . Based on taxes paid now , the actual increase would range from about 15 per cent ip the low brackets to about 3 per cent for people with half million dollar incomes . Treasury Asked More A man with a half million dollar income now pays more than $400,000 taxes , a much bigger proportion than the little fellow . Treasury Secretary Snyder had urged an increase of 4 percentage points , which he estimated would bring in an additional . 3.6 billion dollars a year . The proposed increase , first big positive step toward getting the extra money needed to put the preparedness drive on a pay-aswe-go basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Examples of Boosts For a single person with no dependents and a net income of $2,000 a year after deductions but before personal exemptions , the tax would go up $42 , from S230 to $322 . A married person with no dependents and an $8,000 net income now pays $1,416 . His obligation would be $1,620 under the committee 's plan , an increase of $204 . For a married man with two dependents and a $15,000 net income , the increase would be $378 , from $2,900 to $3,278 . The lowest rate bracket , covering the first $2,000 of surtax net income , would rise from 20 per cent to 23 per cent . The $2,000-$4,000 bracket rate would rise from 22 to 25 per cent ; $1,000-$6,000 from 26 to 29 per rent , $6,000-$8,000 from 30 to 33 per cent , $8,000-$10,000 from 34 to 37 per cent , and so on . Dependent ' Policy Changed In another decision affecting many individuals , the committee tentatively approved special tax treatment for unmarried persons who nevertheless are the heads of families . Such Individuals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be granted appmdmately halt the tax advantage I now enjoyed by married persons under the income splitting provisions of the 1948 tax law . Details remain to be worked out , but the committee approved the idea in principle . The tax writers did not decide today when to make the general income tax increase effective . However , it appears unlikely that the committee will perfect the bill before early June , after which it must be considered by congress , Thus there seems little likelihood the increase could take effect before midyear , or more probably some time in the fall , MORE TAXES , CONTROLS BY PHILIP WARDEN IChicat ? Trilnme rtes. serrao Washington , May 9 ? President Truman asserted today that " we will have to use price and wage controls for the next two or three years . " Speaking to a group of utility and mining company officials at an interior department conference , the President said business men themselves should u-ge congress to extend the controls program . " Most of you are business men who understand the terrible effects that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not kept in check , " the President said . " You know how extremely important it is to hit inflation and hit it hard . " To do that , we will have to use price and wage controls for the next two or three years at least . " Military Demands Grow The President said the demands of military production on materials and man power " will be going up month by month for a long time.v " That , " he said , " is why it is Urgently necessary that the congress continue for two years more the production controls authorized by the defense production act . " He said the new act should provide stiff ' restrictions on prices , wages , credits , and rents , and that congress should raise taxes . He asserted that new controls authority should not be " crippled by a lot of special exemptions for special groups . " The President said the nation 's " Worst enemy " at the moment is neither the Russians nor inflation , but " the feeling that we can relax because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relax " That is a terrible mistake , " he said . " We can not afford to relax . We have three enemies to overcome , one abroad and two at home . Aggression is the first one ? we are shooting that out in Korea just as we did in Germany and Greece . The second is inflation , Relaxation is the third and that is the worst one of all . " Mr. Truman spoke before members of the interior department 's industry advisory committees . Members are business men consulted in a group by interior officials on mutual problems . Today 's was the first joint meeting of all the advisory groups .

Wilson told the conference that the goal of the present mobilization program is " peace . " He said that if in the present mobilization " race " we can make this country " absolutely mighty " with war production , and " at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace goal . Manly t'leischmann , ? national production administrator , told the conference that most of the " trouble " in the materials field has been caused by " advance buying " by both the military and industry . He said the government 's controled materials ph ' n , under which all copper , steel , End aluminum will be doled out to industry and military producers beginning July 1 , should eliminate many materials problems . Big Backlog of Orders Edwin T. Gibson , defense production administrator , was telling the senate banking committee that only a " trickle " of the military orders have been filled . He said the backlog of orders will " place increasingly severe strains on our productive resources , making it necessary to apply more drastic controls . " Chairman Cooley ID. , N. C.1 of the house agriculture committee charged after a hearing that the government 's new beef price controls mean less meat , a diversion of supplies into illegal markets , and much less of a price cut than housewives have been led to expect . He accused Price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woefully weak " case before the committee in attempting to justify the new beef ceilings . At the same time , Cooley accused the meat and live stock industry of failing to give " frank and forthright " answers on the subject . The office of price stabilization announced a new ceiling of $3.35 a pound of " average " grade imported wool , along with new ceilings for all standard grades of wool , alpaca , and mohair . The prices are 65 to 70 per cent above last June 's levels . OPS said the new ceilings probably will have two effects : ill they will increase the price of clothing , but 12J they should encourage greater wool hipments to the United States .
