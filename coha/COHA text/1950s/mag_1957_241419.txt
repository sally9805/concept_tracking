From his gleaming white palace among the golden pagodas in Katmandu , hollow-cheeked King Mahendra issued a royal decree : the new Prime Minister of Nepal is Dr. Kunwar Inderjit Singh . To his neighbors in the two most populous nations in the world , the King 's choice was of major significance . Tiny Nepal lies on a 4,000-ft. - to- 9,000- ft. slope of the Himalayas between Red China and India , and is a pawn in the tense frontier rivalry between them . The Foreign Ministries in both countries last week probably had legitimate misgivings about how Singh will swing . <P> Barrel-chested , walrus-mustached K.I. Singh , 54 , onetime Indian army clerk and practicing homeopathic physician , earned the sobriquet " Robin Hood of the Himalayas " when he began parceling out land to peasant farmers during a nationwide revolt against the autocratic Rana dynasty in 1950 . Worried by Singh 's deeds of derring-do as head of a band of ragged Nepalese army irregulars , nervous Indian army " observers " stationed in Nepal clapped him into jail . He escaped the Indians , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke jail and led a coup that captured the capital 's airfield , treasury and arsenal . The then King of the day , fearful of the Indians , would not let Singh form a government . With 32 followers ( five of whom died en route ) , Singh groped his way through blinding snowstorms into Tibet , then headed for Peking . <P> <P> Six-Shooters . Communist China rolled out the Red carpet for Singh , called him the " potential leader of Free Nepal . " But suddenly he was dropped by the Communists ( a casualty in Chou En-lai 's new policy of coexistence with India ) , and at the Bandung Conference Chou En-lai agreed to return Singh and his followers to Nepal . Singh arrived in Katmandu to the sound of brass bands and cheering thousands , found that corruption and inefficiency in local government had enhanced the memory of him as a Robin Hood . To stimulate the legend of his past military feats , he took to swaggering about town wearing a pair of six-shooters and cradling a 12-gauge shotgun in his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent , Singh was careful not to criticize the Chinese Communists ( " After all , I was their guest " ) , talked , instead , of making Nepal the " Switzerland of the Far East , " i.e. , neutral . He saw that there was no future in Nepalese politics without Indian backing , began insisting that India was Nepal 's " best friend , " and asked the Nepalese to be " more grateful " for Indian economic aid . He was invited to New Delhi and had a chat with Nehru . Nehru laconically concluded : " Not a Communist-just a freebooter . " <P>
