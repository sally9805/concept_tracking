Never had the Moscow radio poured such scorn and enmity on Prime Minister Nehru 's Indian government . Nehru 's sin , though Moscow did not quite put it that way , was to accept U.S. help in freeing India from its periodic famines . <P> Last week the successful farm experiment begun by a county agent from North Carolina and Tennessee was about to be spread across the length &; breadth of India . Horace Holmes , now chief of agriculture in India 's Point Four program , began his experiment in the Etawah district in northern India in 1948 ( TIME , Jan. 22 , 1951 ) . Says he : " I found the Indian farmer struggling with the same problems that we have in America . . . lack of good seed , lack of sufficient credit , poor land , diseases , insects , drought and pests . " Holmes did not attempt to mechanize Etawah , but showed the Indian farmers how to use their primitive implements to better effect . He persuaded them to make compost of village waste , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them how to drain their fields , how to inoculate livestock . <P> When he introduced legume crops to improve the soil , some religious villagers opposed the plowing-in of the live green growth . Tactfully Holmes broke down prejudices , stilled native hostility . The results were spectacular : in Etawah 's 102 villages ( pop . 79,000 ) , food production jumped nearly 50% in three years . Malaria was eliminated ; herds were freed from rinderpest . <P> Nehru decided to set up 50 Etawahs right away , each to take in an average of 300 villages , inhabited by 200,000 people . He had the money ( $50 million from the U.S. , $50 million from his own government ) for the first six months . He needed men . At this point , the U.S. 's Ford Foundation stepped in . It promised to finance the operation of 30 to 40 training schools which would turn out 3,000 village leaders every year . This week the first five Ford Foundation training centers are scheduled to open . If all goes well , Nehru hopes to multiply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-third of India 's 361 million . That would really give the Moscow radio something to talk about .
