Indonesia 's economic crisis grew daily more acute . In Central Java , hungry peasants were reported eating field mice . President Sukarno lingered on , neither ruling nor resting , though the government announced that he was leaving any minute for a vacation tour which would range from Tokyo to Cairo . But government officials were working to stop the forcible seizure of Dutch properties by workers inflamed with nationalist fervor at The Netherlands ' refusal to discuss the question of West Irian ( Netherlands New Guinea ) . In East Java , Indonesian army officers confronted a mob that had surrounded the home of a Dutch estate manager . " Are you brave , very brave ? " asked one officer . " Yes , yes ! " yelled the workers , apparently in the belief that the army would help them sack the Dutch estate . " All right , then , " said the officer , " let 's all invade West Irian . " Shamefacedly , the embarrassed workers shuffled away . <P> Dutch estates , the government insisted , had been neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Premier Djuanda declared that the Dutch have two choices : 1 ) surrender West Irian and resume normal relations with Indonesia ; 2 ) hold West Irian and have their " entire interests in Indonesia liquidated . " <P> Late Word . Ever since Sukarno touched off his expel-the-Dutch campaign , Indonesian moderates had been waiting hopefully for some word from quiet , capable Dr. Mohammed Hatta . First elected Vice President in 1945 , Hatta is Indonesia 's best-known politician after Sukarno , is regarded by many Indonesians as a much more stable and responsible statesman . He resigned 13 months ago in disgust at the President 's insistence on including Communists in his Cabinet , has since rejected all overtures to come back into the government . <P> Last week , in an open letter that made headlines in every newspaper in Indonesia , Hatta made it perfectly clear that he , too , felt the Dutch must go . But he had nothing but scorn for Sukarno 's tactics . Sukarno 's policy of **35;18488;TOOLONG was arbitrary , unrealistic and unnecessary . " If people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crazy steps organized by hot bloods who have done no clear-cut planning . It is not the Indonesian people who should suffer because of the stubbornness of the Dutch government , but the Dutch people , including those who have vested economic interests in Indonesia . " <P> On Cue . Hatta pointedly underscored what every informed Indonesian knew already : that the country has almost no navy or air force and could not possibly take Netherlands New Guinea forcibly no matter how belligerently Sukarno &; Co. may sound off in Djakarta . " Our youth . " said Hatta , " should not be asked to swim across the ocean to get West Irian . It is not through war that we will get back West Irian but by peaceful ways and means . " <P> As if on cue . Indonesian officials in Djakarta announced that because the U.S. had delayed so long in answering their request for arms , they may send a mission to Eastern Europe to see if they can buy Communist arms to beef up their obsolete arsenal .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
