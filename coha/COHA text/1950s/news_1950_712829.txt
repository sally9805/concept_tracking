txt The Senate approved and sent to the White House today the $3,500,000 , - 000 Housing Bill of 1950 with its incentives for home building by families of low and moderate incomes . The House gave its approval Thursday . Signing by President Truman is expected . A $2,000,000,000 program for home building through cooperatives and other non-profit organizations was missing from the measure . Although this was contended in many quarters to be the " heart " of the legislation recommended by the President , Senate and House rejected it . As the bill stands it would operate largely through loans and direct mortgage guarantees . Direct subsidies would be omitted .

Roughly , 43,000 housing units are involved . There was a possibility that , although Congress frowned on the President 's general , cooperative housing recommendations , cooperatives would figure largely in the purchase of homes by present tenants . Under the bill , it was said , the tenants could organize their own cooperatives and buy through them Various programs in the legislation would operate as follows : Under a section added to the National Housing Act construction of low-cost homes in suburbs and outlying areas would be fostered through a $250,000,000 authorization to guarantee mortgages up to 90 per cent of value , with a top $5,000 guarantee on owner-occupant homes .. Mortgages would be guaranteed at 90 per cent of value up to $7,000 and at 60 per cent on the next $3,000 where big rental projects were concerned .

Under Title 2 of the National Housing Act containing permanent authority for insurance of mortgages the new bill provides for mortage insurance at 95 per cent of the first *7,000 of value and 70 per cent for the next $4,000 , applying-to owner-occupancy loans . Now the rate is 90 per cent on the first $7,000 and 80 per cent on the next $4,000 . Two-bedroom houses would be insured up to 95 per cent , with a $7,600 ceiling . The ceiling would rise to $8,550 on three-bedroom houses and $9,500 for houses of four or more bedrooms . This simply alters requirements under the program in effect for several years . Through it buyers of houses , by payment of mortgage insurance fees , are able to get larger mortigage loans . The fees go into an insurance pool to guard lenders against loss .

The loans would allow as much as forty years for payment , at an interest rate approximating 2.55 per cent annually . This housing program had been before the Congress since the 1949 session . As its details were worked out it appeared to become more complex . It seemed that the Senate as a whole was satisfied with the final draft . Senator Burnet R. Maybank , Democrat of South Carolina , chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency , took the floor and started to explain today just what Senate-House conferences had proposed . ' Little continued interest was evident , however , and Senator Maybank suddenly moved that the final draft be adopted . There was a sort of a grunt of approval .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
