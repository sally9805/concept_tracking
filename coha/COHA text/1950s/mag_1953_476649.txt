SOME months ago a young Madison Avenue account executive got talking at lunch about his insomnia , which he said was beginning to worry the hell out of him . Every day was so hectic that when he got to bed at night he found it impossible to unwind himself . At forty , he felt , he was too young for this sort of thing , and something had to be done about it . His friend had a suggestion . " Start playing with postage stamps , " he said . " Best way in the world to relax . " Feeling that he had nothing to lose , the Madison Avenue man dropped in at Gimbels , whose stamp advertisements he had seen in the Sunday papers . He found the stamp department : a large , busy corner of the first floor , with a goodly crowd of earnest-looking customers lining the counters and milling through the display racks . He browsed about for twenty minutes , spent a half hour talking with a salesman who seemed to have all the time in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy bundle which the salesman had assured him would take care of his insomnia for a year . It contained a huge volume entitled The Master Global Stamp Album ( " the most corn-plete and comprehensive single-volume stamp album ever published . . 1,250 pages . . spaces for over 55,000 stamps from all coun- tries of the world ... supplements issued annually " ) , a large pair of limply constructed tweezers , a supply of gummed glassine stickers called " stamp hinges , " and an assortment of 10,000 different postage stamps . The latter was a fifty-five-dollar extravagance . He could have bought a thousand stamps for two dollars , but something came over him when he saw the big , bright packet . His year had run for only three days when he turned up at Gimbels again . He was having difficulty , he reported , in differentiating between some of the almost identical stamps , and there were numerous stamps for which no space had been provided in his album , and in some cases he could not even figure out what country a stamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small booklet on stamp identification and a copy of Scott 's Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue ( " The Encyclopaedia of Philately " ) which contained two thousand pages of fine print and small pictures . The next day , a little red-eyed , he came in again . Evidently he had acquired a good deal of philatelic knowledge and confidence overnight . His purchase consisted of a Japanese reading glass , a small tin perforation gauge , and a watermark detector consisting of a little black dish and a bottle of carbon tetrachloride . At the office , where people had begun to worry about a certain furtive look he had developed , it got about that he had taken to stamp collecting . The furtive look faded when he found that apparently nobody thought the pastime odd . Occasionally someone would stop him at the water cooler to ask neighborly questions about the hobby , and a number of co-workers brought him handfuls of foreign stamps that had somehow accumulated in their desk drawers . The account executive 's initial deprecation of his hobby gradually vanished , and he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he reports , is completely gone now . He relaxes with his stamps until two or three o'clock in the morning , or until his wife screams downstairs at him ; then he goes up to bed and sleeps like a log for what is left of the night . His extravagant packet of ten thousand stamps , he reports with quiet self-satisfaction , did not keep him busy for a full year . Within seven months every stamp had been placed and mounted , and he had taken to prowling up and down Nassau Street for stamps that he " needed " here and there to " fill out a set . " By the end of his fifth month , he had designed so many new pages for insertion in the huge album that he was obliged to buy an extra binder and break the collection up into two volumes . Now , as a matter of fact , he is beginning to neglect the album altogether . He has begun making albums of his own : a sure symptom that he is lost to the non-philatelic world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he searches about for stamps that have some connection with music ? portraits ranging from Beethoven to Ethelbert Nevin , pictures of lutes and native drums , the opening bars of the New World Symphony and the Brazilian national anthem . His wife seems to be bearing up well under it all . She has learned enough about stamps to enable her to listen pleasantly when he gets going on the subject , she has pushed his philatelic clutter back to one corner of oneroom , and she has sworn him to a strict monthly allowance for stamps . She astonished herself as much as him recently when she discovered and bought for him a set of six Romanian stamps showing posthorns . " Stamp widow ? " she says . " I 'm not complaining . He may be a monomaniac now , but he 's a lot easier to live with . " This is a wise and fortunate attitude for a wife . Her husband 's condition is incurable , and her only alternatives are to divorce him or have him committed to a mental institution . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a single stamp collector in any of them . F IGURES on the numberof collectors roam- ing at large would be impossible to obtain . The hobby is a noiseless , unobtrusive pursuit whose devotees are not recognizable as such so long as philately does not pop up in the conversation . It is generally estimated in America though , that at least one person in fifteen is a collector . And in Europe that at least one person in twenty is not . The whole thing goes back only a hundred and fourteen years to the invention of the postage stamp , one of the most important , most revolutionary inventions in modern history . Before postage stamps , sending a letter was often hardly worth the bother , and getting one hardly worth the expense . The letter was written , usually on one sheet of paper ( since two sheets , no matter how small , took at least twice as much postage as one sheet , no matter how large ) , then folded into the form of an envelope and sealed with wax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed over to a clerk who noted its destination , figured out the route it would probably take , marked it with the amount of postage due , and recorded the transaction in his ledgers . The postmaster at the other end of the line reappraised the postage due , sought out the addressee , collected the postage , handed over the letter , and entered the transaction in his books . To anyone who has ever stopped to count the circulars in a single day 's mail , there are obvious disadvantages in a system in which the postage is paid by the addressee . Sir Waiter Scott once paid the equivalent of twenty-five dollars ' postage on a bulky and mysterious letter which turned out to be the manuscript of a verse play , called " The Cherokee Lover , " by a lady author in America who wanted him to read it and get it published for her . A few weeks later , the same thing happened again : a second mammoth letter , a second five-pound fee , a second copy of " The Cherokee Lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astray . Eventually Scott refused to accept mail addressed to him . In those days a lot of people were refusing mail , and much of the mail was intended to be refused . Often there was nothing written in the letter at all . Through prearranged codes , the recipient knew simply by the way the letter was addressed that Cousin Abigail had taken a turn for the better or that the police had finally caught up with Uncle Charles . I N ENGLAND , in 1837 , a young congenital reformer , Rowland Hill , brought out a pamphlet , reviewing the whole mess of conditions that were constantly raising the postal rates and lowering the postal revenues , and suggesting fantastic changes in the setup . It cost the government no more to take a letter four hundred miles than to take it to the next village , although the charge was a shilling for one and twopence for the other ; the real costs were in bookkeeping and postal evasion . Hill proposed that all letters be prepaid at the incredibly low rate of one penny per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be more than offset by the increase in volume . Prepayment could do away with most of the bookkeeping costs if some sort of negotiable receipt were put into use : an ink-stamped envelope , or perhaps " a bit of paper just large enough to bear the stamp , and covered at the back with a glutinous wash , which the bringer might , by the application of a little moisture , attach to the back of the letter . " The government , of course , considered the idea absurd ; the postmaster general mildly stated that it was " the most extravagant of all the wild and visionary schemes " to which he had been exposed . The people , in the main , disagreed . They held mass meetings in every town in England , they got up huge petitions , and they finally bludgeoned Parliament into adopting the Hill scheme entire . The penny rats went into effect in January 1840 , and the first day 's mail was triple the normal volume . Envelopes and adhesive stamps went on sale May 10 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an allegorical drawing by the distinguished artist William Mulready . It showed Britannia surrounded by lions , elephants , colonial natives , small English families , and winged messengers , most of them writing , delivering , or reading letters . The Mulready Envelope was quickly and mercilessly lampooned out of existence . The adhesive stamp fared better . Designed by Hill himself , it w as a simple and beautiful tiling showing a stylized profile of Queen Victoria , with the word " Postage " . above it and " One Penny " below , and a capital letter in each of the bottom corners to show the individual stamp 's position in the full printed sheet . The name of the country was omitted ( and still is ) on the logical assumption that anyone who can read and write can also recognize a picture of the Queen of England . The stamp was enormously popular ? within ten years it had pushed the mail volume up to five times the old figure ? and so , for that matter , was Rowland Hill . He had trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a change of government in 1841 tossed him temporarily out of the Post Office , a popular subscription of ? 13,360 was raised for him . In 1860 he was knighted . In 1864 he was retired with a full-salary pension and a Parliamentary grant of ? 20,000 . He is buried in Westminster Abbey next to James Watt , who merely invented the steam engine . The postage-stamp idea spread rather quickly to the Swiss cantons , to Brazil , to Mauritius , and to the United States , where it was first used by some individual postmasters and then adopted by Congress in 1847 . The American philatelist Prescott H. Thorp , in his Complete Guide to Stamp Collecting , says reverently and without reservation that it is " the one perfect invention . The world 's most recent postage stamp does not differ materially from that first attempt . " T HE collecting hobby seems to have started the day the first stamp was issued . Many of the 60,000 Penny Blacks sold that day were bought as curiosities or souvenirs ? so many , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good condition , at around five dollars a copy . The first record of stamp fever is in an advertisement that ran in the Times of London in 1841 : " A young lady , being desirous of covering her dressing room with canceled postage stamps , has been so far encouraged in her wish by private friends as to have succeeded in collecting 16,000 ! These , however , being insufficient , she will be greatly obliged if any good-natured person who may have these ( otherwise useless ) little articles at their disposal would assist her in her whimsical project . " Small crowds of small boys , bank clerks , cabinet members , and idle ladies began gathering in London 's Birchin Lane and Paris ' Tuileries Gardens to compare and swap stamps . By 1863 the whole setup was there : stamp dealers , catalogues , philatelic magazines , and illustrated albums in which , at that time , all the stamps of the world could be mounted . The hobby has grown to be unquestionably the most popular in the world . In Europe , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many refugees of the second world war were able to start life anew with the proceeds of their stamp collections . During the war , American soldiers in foreign countries are said to have spent more than twenty million dollars for postage stamps . One of the first acts of the American military government in Germany was to solicit from Ernest A. Kehr , stamp editor of the New York Herald Tribune , a magazine article which would bring the stamp-hungry Germans up to date on the United States issues they had missed while they were busy conquering the world . In America the hobby has grown tremendously in the past twenty years or so . Most of its growth is credited to three men : Franklin Roosevelt , who was an ardent collector ; James Farley , who is a master salesman ; and a Polish immigrant named Jacques Minkus , who is both . When Roosevelt was seven years old , his mother gave him a batch of stamps on old letters that his grandfather Delano bad written from Hong Kong . According to popular history , Mrs. Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted him to grow up to be President . She could hardly have dreamed , the day she dumped the box of family keepsakes in his lap , that he was destined to be not only the best-known stamp collector in the world , but also a sort of patron saint to the hobby . In the long , grim period when he was fighting infantile paralysis , Roosevelt depended heavily on the diversion offered by his stamp collection . In later years he said , " I owe my life to my hobbies , especially stamp collecting , " a statement which every collector can understand and believe . In his White House years he was known to keep important visitors waiting while he talked stamps with some philatelic crony who had dropped in . The last thing he did at night was to spend half an hour puttering with stamps , and the first thing on Sunday morning was to study the stamp columns in the newspapers . On his spectacular wartime trips , he always lugged several albums along . There had been numerous well-known collectors before Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , Fuad of Egypt , Alfonso XIII of Spain , and Carol of Romania ? but none succeeded in doing what Roosevelt did for the hobby . The average American collector kept discreetly quiet about his hobby , wisely assuming that his neighbor would regard it as rather infantile . Roosevelt 's unashamed addiction not only attracted millions of people into the hobby ; it also made the thing respectable . Roosevelt was never one of the " great philatelists " ; he never devoted inordinate amounts of time or money to it , and his passion for stamps was probably always the passion that a small boy feels for them . When his collection was sold at auction in 1946 , most of it turned out to be what a top-ranking dealer would call junk . Unable ever to throw a stamp away , he had filled page after page with countless copies of the same stamp , each differing from the next only in its cancellation or in a tiny shading of color . His special collections of Hong Kong and Latin America were large and thoughtful ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him by foreign governments , there was hardly a single stamp to make a dealer begin breathing heavily . The collection was appraised by George 13 . Sloane of Nassau Street , who " made a point of looking at every stamp as if it belonged to John J. Jones " and arrived at an estimate of $80,000 . One sheet of paper bearing nine copies of the Mother 's Day issue and the autograph of Sarah Delano Roosevelt was appraised at fifty cents ; in the Roosevelt auctions it brought five hundred dollars . The whole philatelic estate realized almost a quarter of a million dollars . This is not a staggering figure ; the collection of Colonel Edward I I. R. Green , the son of Hetty Green , sold for three million dollars . Roosevelt made two large specific contributions to philately . One was in loosening up the laws covering the reproduction of stamps in philatelic publications ; the other was in giving the job of Postmaster General to Jim Farley . v ARLEY tackled the work of selling postage stamps with as much zest as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in to see him , and those who did not were likely to run into him anyway at philatelic meetings and exhibitions . He showed a keen talent for planting stories and stirring up controversies to draw attention to new stamp issues . When the NRAstamp came out in 1933 , he made sure that it was pointed out to certain commentators that the farmer 's sickle and the workman 's apron both looked suspiciously Russian . He slyly issued a three-cent stamp in carmine , a color which the Universal Postal Union prescribes for two-cent stamps . He did his best campaign on the Mother 's Day Stamp , one of several Roosevelt-era stamps designed by the President himself , by stirring up a storm of protest over the " chopped-off " legs of Whistler 's Mother and the addition of a vase of carnations to the picture . Many of his special issues , such as the National Parks and Army-Navy series , made collectors of people who had never looked twice at a postage stamp before . T HE man who combines in himself the stamp mania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacques Minkus , who got into the business almost accidentally . Originally from Lublin , Mr. Minkus had hoisted himself into his own business . the publishing of dictionaries and popular translations , in Berlin and Paris before immigrating to America in 1929 . A collector of the stamps of Russia and former Russian states , he gravitated into publishing with his brother Morris a line of ten-cent stamp albums that introduced philately to the American dime store . When the partnership was dissolved after a couple of years , he found himself with a large stock of albums and stamp packets that he had imported to go with them . In a heroic piece of salesmanship , he sold the Gimbel Brothers department store on lending him , on a commission basis , six feet of counter space for twenty-four hours . Gimbels had tried selling stamps before ; so had R. H. Macy and Company ; and Marshall Field of Chicago had reportedly lost fifty thousand dollars in stamps in a single year . Not Mr. Minkus . After twenty-three years , the stamp department almost dominates Gimbels ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keeps spreading to other stores , including Marshall Field . Mr. Minkus advertises largely , usually in the news sections of the Sunday papers rather than on the hobby pages . He hires stamp experts as salesmen , coaxes them into giving up the hobby ( so that they wo n't be competing with their customers ) , pays them so well that they would not dream of going somewhere else , and gently drills into them the Minkus concept of the Customer . By department store standards , it is a somewhat radical concept . CUSTOMER , according to Mr. Minkus , is like a friend in your house , except that a friend requires less attention . When one wanders into a stamp department , he says , " We might well assume that it is the only visit he will make here in his whole lifetime . " If we give him the attention he deserves ? and which of us does n't have five extra minutes to spare ? ? we will have made a stamp collector and a friend . If we neglect or rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And we must always remember that nobody actually needs anything we have to sell . Shirts , yes . Stamps , no . " This seems to make an impression on the salesmen . None of them ever snaps at a customer , and the one new man who was heard telling a little boy to come on and make up his mind was on his way home almost as quickly as the little boy was : Small boys , as a matter of fact , appear to be the favored aristocracy of the Minkus clientele . A single demand is sometimes made upon them ? that they stash their carfare home safely away in a separate pocket before they start counting up what they can spend on stamps . Beyond that , they may stand around gaping for hours , run their greasy little fingers over the glass of the counters and display racks , ask dozens of questions , and change their minds five minutes after a purchase has been rung up on the cash register . Mr. Minkus himself is notorious for devoting half an hour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older customer stands waiting to spend perhaps eight thousand dollars . . For any sizable stamp operation , there is a large problem simply in maintaining the stock . Gimbels carries more than a hundred thousand separate items , stamps ranging from a half-cent Nathan Hale to " Lincoln imperforate blocks of four " retailing at thirty-five hundred dollars , and packets from a ten-cent selection of a hundred to an envelope of fifty thousand different stamps selling for twenty-five hundred dollars . For Mr. Minkus , who has built his trade mostly along popular lines , the stock problem is staggering . On his last trip to Europe , he wandered from one of his suppliers to another , ordering five million stamps here and twenty million there . " This fabulous merchandiser , " said one of his bulk suppliers , " with his cheap pretty stamps for little boys and girls , is systematically draining the European supply . " Besides his packaging and service as well as his advertising and promotion stunts , Mr. Minkus has set out still another lure for the potential philatelist . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Scott 's and some of the other lines that have become too comfortably stodgy over the years . Tired of apologizing for the shortcomings in the books and albums he had to sell , Mr. Minkus and a young Czech named George Tlarnsa devised a number of albums along new lines , and the stamp trade greeted them with open arms . Their Master Global Album , cheaper and fuller than anything else in its class , was welcomed by the Natibnal Stamp News as " the greatest album ever published . " A month ago , Minkus Publications entered the last stronghold of the publishing patriarchs : the catalogue business , with The New American Stamp Catalog . " The difference between Mr. Minkus and me , " one Nassau Street dealer said recently , " is that he 's a real merchandiser and a gambler , and he does a good deal of my work for me . He 's got albums in the bookstores and stamps in the Montgomery Ward catalogue and stamp collectors in the hills of Arkansas , and some of his business always finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that I 'd pay to stay in the business . " p HILATELIC writers , attempting to explain the fascination of the hobby , usually succeed only in demonstrating that it can not be done . They can give some idea of what happens to the collector , but no idea of how or why . In most cases , apparently , it begins as a moment at which his soul is own . Addiction to research symptom . of philatelic fever . This is probably inevitable , since even the dullest-looking postage stamp has something on it to excite some degree of curiosity . Even in the uses to which stamps arc put , there is wide and wild variety . Besides the ordinary ones ? regular and commemorative issues , air mail , special delivery , postage-due , and such ? there are stamps for mailing newspapers , for having fourth-class matter delivered with the first-class mail , for sending letters by Zeppelin or pneumatic post , for collecting special taxes or money for charity , and in one instance ( the 1855 " Too Late " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter sent out after the regular mails have closed . The Dominican Republic had a stamp whose use was compulsory on letters addressed to the president . Argentina had a special stamp for messages recorded on phonograph records . In Czechoslovakia there used to be a stamp insuring that the postman would give the letter only to the addressee . T HE amount of knowledge to be picked up in looking at the stamps is enormous , and the curiosity it can arouse , espe-cially in a small child , is apparently infinite . A quick glance through a beginner 's album can turn up pictures of Pasteur , Sarah Bernhardt , Franz Josef on horseback , an okapi , an American skunk , a kauri tree , three Kaffir huts , the Bounty Bible , a Sudanese water wheel , Goya 's " Maja Desnuda , " a Moscow subway station , Stevenson 's bungalow in Samoa , the ruins of Persepolis , the Normandy invasion , a Newfoundland fishing fleet leaving the Banks , an aerial view of Kathmandu , and Sancho Panza being tossed in a blanket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change in their value or in the government , are in many cases more intriguing than the stamps themselves . Inflation overprints show values in 1948 Chinese stamps running as high as fifty thousand dollars ; in 1923 German issues , fifty billion marks ; and in Hungarian stamps of 1948 , five hundred billion pengOs . ( At one point , the rate of exchange was five hundred quintillion pengiis to the dollar . ) There is , of course , little practical value in knowing that Hungary had a Communist government in 1919 , or that the New Republic was an autonomous territory in Zululand long before it was a magazine , or that Lope de Vega 's bookplate pictured a dead cockroach lying on its back . The possession of this fantastic trivia , though , seems to give the possessor a certain quiet self-esteem , and he keeps storing up lore at a prodigious rate . Sometimes , as in the case of Frank lin Roosevelt , who acquired in fifty-seven years of stamp collecting a remarkable knowledge of geography and history , he is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first stage and the goggle-eyed fascination of the second , the collector finds himself in a third phase characterized by restlessness and compulsion . Having filled a good number of spaces in his album , he finds that he is no longer working a jigsaw puzzle ; now it is more like a crossword puzzle , and every blank space in the album is a reproach . Ina real stamp collector , completeness is an obsession . In a general collection , a world album , completeness is impossible . There are INSOMNIA , STAMPS , already more than 125,000 major varieties of stamps recognized , ranging in market value from two cents to fifty thousand dollars . Of the latter , an 1856 one-cent British Guiana stamp erroneously printed on magenta paper , only one copy is known to exist , and nobody seems to know who owns that one at the moment . New stamps are being issued at a great rate , a good many of them aimed directly at the collector . The national economies of places like Andorra , Liberia , Lichtenstein , Luxembourg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exports . The Soviet Union floods the market ; one English-language wholesale list for 1947 through 1951 offered 588 different stamps for a total of $118.71 . ( The United States ' output for that period was sixty-six stamps with a lace value of $3.09 . ) So far as it can he determined , all of these gaudy Russian broadsides are issued for propaganda and dollars , and the Russian people satisfy themselves with the same drab little set of stickers they have been using since 1929 . Almost every country on earth except the United States and Great Britain is devoted to " semi-postal " stamps , of which a part of the price pays postage and the rest goes to a specified worthy cause . There is no discernible limit to the number of things worth commemorating or of causes worth supporting ; at any rate every year brings forth about twenty-five hundred new stamps . v ACED with this kind of opposition , the general collector has to push his album a little off to one side and begin specializ-ing . The lucky ones find a topical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have great enjoyment at small cost . Others go in for United States and British colonials , which leaves them in almost as bad shape as they were before , since in American collecting alone there are at least a dozen items whose values range from five thousand to fifteen thousand dollars . A number of United States collectors go off into such fields as postmarks , " stampless covers " ( letters predating the use of stamps ) , blocks of stamps from the same position in the full sheet , revenue stamps and the issues of the Confederate States of America . Every time a new stamp comes out , great numbers of people go down to the post office and buy one or more full sheets ( of fifty or one hundred ) , sure that they will " be worth a lot one day . " What they will be worth will depend on how many people have had the same idea and whether anybody needs the stamps in question when the owner wants to unload them . A certain coolness exists between mint-sheet buyers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as hoarders . The hoarders , in turn , regard the album crowd as wool-gatherers . " What kind of hobby is it , " they say , " when you have to have a magnifying glass to enjoy it ? " The sheet buyers also encounter a certain coolness at post offices . Although the government has a Philatelic Agency in Washington that sells an average of two million dollars ' worth of stamps to collectors every year , the mint-sheeters seem to prefer the local stamp windows , where they hold up long lines of office boys and mail-room clerks by buying ten sheets of the new three-cent Patton commemorative , examining each sheet meticulously to see that the perforations are just right , and unhurriedly exchanging the ones that are half a millimeter off . In New York , separate philatelic windows have been set up in the main Manhattan and Brooklyn post offices to keep the rest of the postal operation from bogging down . P ERHAPS the most fortunate mint-sheet buyer in history was a collector in Wash- ington who went to the post office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man ahead of him in the line ordered a sheet of air mails , probably to be used for some such sordid purpose as mailing letters , and indignantly handed the sheet back to the clerk because the airplanes on all the stamps were upside down . Feeling the hand of God upon his shoulder , the collector took his place at the window . " A sheet of air mails , " he said , " and make it the one the other guy did n't want . " The sheet , which proved to be the only such error in existence , was sold in a matter of days for fifteen thousand dollars , and any single stamp from it is valued today at $3,500 . To an advanced and affluent collector who has every United States air mail except the twenty-four-cent invert , thirty-five hundred is little enough to pay for it . To a man collecting early British colonials , such a figure is ridiculous , but he can see paying five thousand dollars for the 1854-57 four-penny blue of Western Australia ( inverted frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men wearing eyeglasses , neither makes sense . To any real collector , catalogue value means nothing . Completeness and thoroughness of collection are all that counts . One of the great American philatelists was the late Charles Lathrop Pack , who collected in several fields and consistently walked away with the top prizes in all of them . Mr. Pack was such an expert that he once received from King George V a batch of early Victoria stamps and a four-page longhand letter asking his advice in plating them . At one exhibition , where he was particularly proud of having stolen the show , lie eavesdropped on a couple of collectors looking over his exhibit . " If I had that kind of money to spend on stamps , " said one of them , " 1 could win prizes too . " Deeply hurt , Mr. Pack set out to buy large hatches of the cheapest stamps he could find : Brazilian Dom Pedro heads and the Canadian small-cents issues , both of which sold for a few cents a thousand . By the time he finishedstudying every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color , the plate varieties and the postmarks , he had built two collections that won world-wide honors , and he could tell any other stamp collector on earth to go to hell . Mr. Pack represented the last stage of philatelic fever : the stage in which a stamp itself is unimportant compared to what can be found out about it . The jaded collector looks at a Newfoundland issue of 1928 and notes that the perforation seems a little uncertain . He examines other specimens of the same issue and finds perforations both good and bad . The poor ones can mean either that the perforation machine got dull or that there was one printing of 1928 Newfoundlands that he does not know about , a printing that possibly should be listed as a separate variety . Another factor comes into the picture . Many of the prewar postal records for Newfoundland were destroyed in the London blitz , making investigation very difficult and completely irresistible . Already thinking of himself as a Research Philatelist , the collector begins buying thousands of copies of the stamp . Months or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out exhaustively and send it off to some philatelic magazine . There it will appear between a thorough study of Scottish postmarks of 1840-GO and a treatise proving that the 1939 type of Tibet was actually the same old 1933 . For the philatelist , past this there is nothing . Heaven itself will seem a little trivial .
