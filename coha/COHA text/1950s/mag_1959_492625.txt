Capt . George Mabry had landed on Utah Beach with the first wave of American infantry . By the time he made contact with paratroopers from the 101st Division he had been ashore four and a half hours and advanced over two miles from the invasion beach . So far , the sea-borne infantry 's losses had been astonishingly small ; that was the real measure of the American air-borne troops ' success . Although the scattered drop had upset their plans of battle , they had reacted everywhere with spontaneous guerrilla warfare . The result was that the forces defending Utah Beach were cut off from the German Army command , which was not even told till the afternoon that a landing had started there . No German reinforcements ever got near the beach . The losses of parachutists appeared to be very high at first . At dawn , five out of six of them were missing . But many of the missing men soon turned up , and a couple of months later , when there was time to prepare statistics , it was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been killed on D ' Day or was still missing . That was less than the paratroopers themselves expected , and by the standards of war it was a price worth paying . It was only by chance that George Mabry was the first sea-borne officer to report to Maxwell Taylor , the air-borne general . Nobody had planned it . But his experience of the landing was typical of the experience of most of the 600 men who landed in the first wave of American troops on Utah Beach on D Day morning . Mabry was twenty-six , and he had grown up in Sumter County , South Carolina , where his father , who had once been a baseball star in various semipro leagues in the South Atlantic states , was a cotton farmer on a fairly big scale . George 's pastimes when he was a boy were fishing in the rivers and hunting in the woods around his house . When an Englishman heard George speak of his boyhood , it seemed unexpectedly familiar ; then he realized that he m 6 i - b ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Twain 's stories . George 's greatest sorrow in his youth was being small . He overcame that disadvantage by outdoing the other boys , walking farther . swimming longer , climbing higher trees . He believed he would always have to do this sort of thing to keep his end up . When he left high school he told his father he did not want to go to college , and his father shrewdly gave him a tough job  --  running a farm which employed thirty men . George ran the farm for a year . By the end of the year , he had fought in a boxing ring every able-bodied employee to prove that he was the boss ; and having done that he agreed to go to college . He joined the Army on a reserve commission before Pearl Harbor . when people were just beginning to believe that America would fight . As a junior officer his smallness made hint adopt the principle of never telling anyone to do anything he could not do himself . Whenever he thought about combat , he pictured himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consequently , he believed he was sure to be killed . ( Continued on Page 155 ) : ( 1 ) 11 1. , 1 ) Day ( Continued from Page 43 ) The idea did not worry him , once he was used to it . He would not have told anyone about it , but by then he was married , and he had to tell his wife . In the waiting time in England , George Mabry was engrossed in the detailed plans of what his own battalion had to do . Two of its companies . 300 men , were to land from ten landing craft on the left end of Utah Beach , while two companies of another battalion of the same regiment landed on the right . At the same time thirty-two amphibious tanks were due to land . Five minutes later the second wave was due-900 men in thirty landing craft , including the rest of his battalion . After them there were more tanks , and engineers to demolish the obstacles which the Germans had put on the beach and to blow gaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And behind all this was the organization which was to put ashore 21 , - 000 men and 1700 vehicles and 1700 tons of supplies on that single beach by nightfall . In military language the word spearhead is often used , and it was never more appropriate : The battalion in which George Mabry served was the head of a spear with a tremendous weight behind it in the shaft . The battalion 's responsibility kept Mabry up night after night , poring over the plans and trying to perfect them . Late one evening , to his surprise , the assistant commander of his division came stumping into his office and sat down and said , " What the hell are you up to , George ? Quit worrying . " This was Brig . Gen. Theodore Roosevelt , Jr . " Whatever you plan , " the general went on , " the boys are just going right in there and throw in all they 've got . So what do you want with all this paper ? " George stopped fussing over his plans , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battalion landed . It was General Roosevelt himself who changed them on the spot ; for in spite of his rank and his age  --  he was fiftysix  --  he had volunteered to land with the first company and co-ordinate the attack . Roosevelt was the most senior in rank and probably much the oldest of all the men in the first waves of the invasion ; he must also be accounted its most striking personality . He was the eldest son of Pres. Theodore Roosevelt and a cousin of Pres. Franklin Roosevelt . Like his father , he had had a career of soldiering , politics and exploring . He had already seen action in North Africa and Italy . He was always oblivious of his own safety . He hardly ever looked like a general . He seemed to treat everyone , except laggards , with affectionate disrespect ; and he had an ability to see life from a private 's point of view . In the first four days of the invasion he was said to have had four personal jeeps shot to pieces . George Mabry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this remarkable man . Indeed , every one of the 600 men of this spearhead on Utah must have been aware of the general 's presence on the beach and thought , If the old Mall can take it , so can we . One man whom he drove to mock despair was his aide . " The old feller 'll get me killed , " he lamented to Mabry . " He does n't give a damn for anything . " But it was not so . The general led the men ashore , inspired them through the first of their battles , saw the invasion succeed , risked his own life a hundred times and fell dead of a heart attack thirty-six days later . They buried him at SainteM  --  re-tglise . After the war his body was transferred to the United States military cemetery at Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer , The general was present when the day came at last for the battalion to embark at Torquay . George Mabry stood on the quay and watched the men carrying their equipment aboard the tender which was to take them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battalion he knew every man in it by sight . He had helped to weed out the weaklings ; now among those who were left , there was no visible sign of fear as they packed themselves on hoard for the ultimate adventure . A small soldier was staggering up the ramp , carrying the base plate of a mortar , when Mabry heard the general 's booming voice , " The Army has n't changed in a hundred years . Always the littlest guy gets the biggest load . " The small soldier grinned and hitched his burden higher . For the infantry in their large troopships , the channel crossing was less dramatic than for men in small landing craft . They were quartered below decks , and most of them saw very little of the sea or 153 of the armada on it  --  the 865 vessels on their way to Utah Beach  --  or of the forces at sea and in the air which were employed to protect them . On the crossing , Mabry heard the general shouting to his aide , " Steve , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given you four already , " the aide replied , with a delicate hint of reproach . " Well , give me another , " the general said . " I 've lost the whole damned lot . " " Did you notice his armament ? " the aide asked Mabry . " A pistol and seven rounds , and his cane . He says that 's all he 'll need " // At 2:30 A.M. the engines of the troopship stopped , Mabry went up on deck . They were nowhere . All around , Mabry saw the shadows of other ships , unlit and silent . Far away to the west there were flashes and flares ; he guessed they came from the Cherbourg peninsula , where the air-borne fight should already be going on . The silence seemed sinister . Nobody could believe that the Germans did not know the fleet was there . There was an uneasy feeling of an ambush . The transfer to landing craft had been rehearsed so often that no orders had to be given . Al five minutes past four , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mabry took his turn , and one by one the landing craft cast off and began to circle round to wait till it was time to head for the beach . At 4:55 they started their long run  --  an hour and a half  --  toward the beach . They were led by two 173-foot patrol craft and one smaller boat fitted with radar . There should have been two radar boats , but at the critical moment one had got a rope round its propeller and could not move . It was the first of a series of mishaps which were to upset all calculations . Mabry was in a free boat  --  a boat attached to no particular wave of assault , that could land at whatever stage seemed best . It started behind the second wave , but soon began to catch up with the first . Mabry could see ahead the battleship Nevada and a line of British and American cruisers lying at anchor ; astern , the command ship Bayfield , the transports and tank landing craft . As the dawn light increased , ships more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyers , minesweepers , the ancient British monitor Erebus , U.S.S. Quincy and U.S.S. Tuscaloosa ; incredible , uncountable numbers of ships from horizon to horizon . They lay still and silent , though already the sound of distant guns was rolling in from the northwest , where American destroyers were under fire from the coast and the British cruiser Black Prince was fighting a duel with a German battery . The column of boats steered for a gap in the line to the south of the Nevada ; as they approached , the hands of clocks moved on to the minute for which the ships were waiting-5:40 . Mabry saw the muzzle flashes and the smoke , and then the spitting crash of the first salvos of the bombardment came across the water like a wall of sound . For forty-seven minutes there was never a pause in the roar of naval gunfire . The boats crept in beyond the warships , underneath the shells . Before six o'clock Mabry could see the shore  --  or rather the smoke and dust of shellbursts which spouted from it . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombers come down through the low gray clouds , squadrons and squadrons of them , and antiaircraft fire go up . One bomber exploded in an orange flame . The shore erupted again and again as bombs were added to the shells . Ahead a small ship was floating bottom up . Mabry 's landing craft passed close by , and someone identified it  --  one of the two patrol craft which were guiding the boats to the beach . Two men were lying on the keel . One seemed to be dead , the other was waving . They did not stop . Soon after they passed , the ship sank . Beyond it , an amphibious tank was on the point of sinking . Its crew had escaped and were swimming , but Mabry saw an officer struggling half out of the turret . It was a man he knew . The tank wallowed and sank , dragging the man down with it . Mabry thought of him sadly . ( But long after , he met him again ; he had been trapped by his foot , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . ) The shore was now close . Landing craft armed with 4.7-inch guns were closing on either side , shooting at the dunes . Seventeen tank landing craft fitted with rocket launchers fired salvos of fifty-pound rockets with a noise which was fearsome even above the gunfire . Mabry could see the sandy beach heaving , drenched with explosives . Smoke and dust and fine sand were drifting out to sea , and he only caught glimpses of the dunes behind the beach . There should have been a windmill and a small patch of dunes called 4Continued on Page 157 ) mortification . All these years he had meant to be out in front in COM bat ; and now , he thought , in his .1 cry first combat , he was just following on the tail of the company . So he got up and ran on . He went over the top of a dune and came lace to face with the Germans . One had a grenade in his hand and raised his arm to throw it , so Mabry shot him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . He wondered why four men should surrender to him alone . but glancing round he saw what they had seen through a gap in the dunes there was a view of the sea iind a great armada of ships . The sight was enough to make anyone glad to surrender . He did not want to be delayed by prisoners , but luckily he saw an American soldier just then  --  the first he had seen since he started through the dunes . He gave him the prisoners and asked him if he had seen G Company . The man said that so far as he knew they were still on the beach . Even then Mabry went on , believing they were in front of him . What brought him up in the end was a pillbox , from which a machine gun fired at him . He took cover in a drainage ditch and tried to crawl along it , but he was shot at whenever he showed his head . This personal attention convinced him at last that the company had not already passed that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company than behind it , and he never thought twice about going back . Instead he lay in the ditch and studied the little tactical problem of the pillbox . Several other men came up and dived into the ditch when they came under fire . Even with their support he could not figure out any way of capturing the pillbox , so he sent one of them back to look for a tank . Mabry had rather lost count of lime by then . Probably it was after nine o'clock . At all events , the engineers who landed in the third wave must by then have bulldozed a track through the dunes , because Mabry 's rather imperious demand for a tank was soon answered . One of the twenty-eight amphibious tanks which had reached the shore came roaring along at the back of the dunes , fired four shots at the pillbox and roared away . Mabry and his followers were left to collect the dozen Germans who had come out waving the white flag the defending forces seemed always to find at short notice . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little farther , and after a while he saw a causeway across the floods which seemed to be intact and undefended . This was Exit I , which led to Pouppeville , and thence to Sainte-Marie-du-Mont . There was a little bridge in the middle of it , and while he advanced toward it a few Germans came running from the other end and jumped off the road by the bridge and disappeared beneath it . They might just be looking for a hide-out , he thought ; but they might be laying charges to blow up the bridge . He collected his followers  --  a dozen or so by then , stragglers like himself  --  and began to stalk the Germans . It was while he was crawling through the flat , wet meadows that he heard shooting from Pouppeville and guessed that American paratroopers were there . He hoisted the small orange flag which he had been given to use in that very situation  --  the flag which Colonel Ewell 's men saw after their battle in the village school . The parachutists came down the causeway , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans at the bridge were caught between them . An air-borne lieutenant greeted Mabry as if he had not seen an American for years and told him that General Taylor would certainly be glad to meet him . The whole thing had not been at all the sort of combat which Mabry had always imagined . From a military point of view he had made rather a mess of it . But even though it had happened by mistake , he had fulfilled an ambition : He was certainly out in front . The whole landing had been much easier than anyone had anticipated . The confusion caused by landing too far south had not lasted long ; most of the infantrymen had used their own common sense and initiative , like Mabry , and made for their objectives . The battalion as a whole crossed the floods in safety and joined up with the air-borne men soon after midday ; and of all the thousands who landed that morning on Utah , only twelve were killed and just over 100 wounded . For this comparatively easy passage the seaborne troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Navy and Air Force . Many men on the ground on D Day , American and British and German , took it upon themselves to criticize their air forces . Some of them  --  the Germans in particular  --  had reason to be annoyed , but most had none at all . Few of the critics had any idea of the difficulties of flying on that day . Weather and antiaircraft fire were obvious difficulties ; but another , less obvious , was the congestion in the air . The crews of the Marauder bombers , which Mabry had seen as he approached the beach , thought much less about the German opposition than about the risk of collision . These crews had not been briefed until two o'clock that morning . They were flying every day over France , and any of them , any day , might have been shot down and captured ; so they could not be told the secret of D Day until the last moment . However , everyone in the tacti ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one where I Am most content Ears arc lowered But left unbent . Hugh Burr ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? cal air force had known since the previous day that something was up , because all their aircraft had suddenly been marked with black and white stripes . Someone had foreseen that when there was such an enormous number of aircraft in the sky both the troops and the fighter pilots would need an infallible method of distinguishing enemy from friend . New identity marks were needed . and they had to appear for the first time on the morning of D Day , so that the Germans would not have time to copy them . Broad stripes of whitewash were a good answer , but even this simple plan was not easy to execute on the scale which was required . More than 9000 aircraft had to be painted in a single evening . To make sure of the job , 100,000 gallons of whitewash were ordered . In all Britain there was nothing like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtime , gave up its Whitsun weekend without knowing why its humble product had suddenly become so important and finally delivered the stuff in time . By comparison , the purchase and distribution of 20,000 paintbrushes was a simple affair . One of the bomb groups of Marauders destined for Utah Beach was briefed by its colonel , Wilson R. Wood , and his briefing made such a deep impression on his crews that many of them never forgot what he said . At twenty-five . Colonel Wood was an impressive person , partly perhaps because he was tall and handsome , partly because he was a Texan and had the distinctive charm of a Southerner . That morning in the briefing but on his airfield , northeast of London , he stood up and began to speak . " This morning 's mission , " he said , " is the most important mission you 've ever flown . Maybe the most important mission anyone has ever flown , This is the invasion . Our job is to bomb the beach , and right after our bombs go down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sea . " This introduction had his crews on the edge of their seats . " I do n't care if any of your aircraft are not a hundred per cent , " he went on . " You 'll fly them this morning , and you 'll get over that beach whatever happens , and you 'll take any risk to get right on your targets and give those boys in the boats all the help you can . " Wood led his own group across the channel , flying all the way below the cloud base . There was broken cloud from 2000 feet up to 7000 feet , and a fairly solid layer above that . Wood saw the coast less than two minutes before he crossed it  --  the straight , featureless line of shore , so long that it vanished in haze in both directions . In those minutes he flew into the most congested bit of air he had ever seen . The area of each of the seven targets was very small  --  perhaps 100 yards square . Two hundred and seventy-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of hundred feet of the cloud base . Some had approached above the clouds and came down through gaps at unpredictable moments . But keeping a lookout for other aircraft was no help to accurate bombing . Wood determined to concentrate on his target and leave a collision to chance ; but it needed all the self-control he had . When his own bombs went down , he turned away toward the sea . He could not see where they had fallen , for the whole shore was smoking and flashing like a fireworks display ; but he was satisfied . As he cleared the coast , he saw the landing craft , heading toward the beach in an endless column . He wished them luck . He had done all that an airman could to help them through . Before eleven o'clock the landing on Utah Beach had become a routine . Among the men who were pouring ashore was Chaplain Luechinger , a Capuchin friar and a native New Yorker , better known to his Manhattan congregation as Father Bruno . So far as he could remember afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard a bang . To be a friar from Manhattan suggests a contradiction , since friars are by repute unworldly ; but the contradiction was only superficial . The brown hood of a Capuchin often hides a remarkable amount of worldly wisdom , and for a Capuchin friar to wade ashore on D Day was no contradiction at all , because the order has provided chaplains for armies since the Middle Ages . On the beach the padre found a scene which was humming with activity , but showed little sign of battle . Roads had been bulldozed through the dunes , and tanks , artillery and supply trucks were rolling out of tank landing craft , assembling and roaring along the new roads toward the causeways . There were hundreds and hundreds of men on the beach  --  infantrymen landing , waiting for orders and moving inland ; signalers , prisoners , naval units , medics ; it was with these , in the aid posts , that a padre 's work was found . He went from post to post , giving thanks in his heart that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a priest , and confident , like all other men on the beach , that the plan had succeeded . But twelve miles to the eastward , at this same hour , on Omaha Beach , there was a man whose home was quite close to Father Bruno 's ; and he was crouching in a foxhole , bewildered and leaderless , looking out on a scene of terror and utter confusion . .
