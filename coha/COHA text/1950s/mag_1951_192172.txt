In Tombstone , * Ariz. , one of the toughest western mining camps of the ' 80s , it was only natural that the daily paper should be named the Epitaph . It was not because , as one old miner once cracked , newspapers , like epitaphs , are full of lies . On the contrary , the Epitaph gave such an accurate picture of the rootin ' - tootin ' - shootin ' West that for years its files have proved a valuable source for historians . <P> The Epitaph at last gets its public due in Tombstone 's Epitaph ( University of New Mexico Press ; $4.50 ) , by Douglas D. Martin , onetime Pulitzer Prizewinner , ex-managing editor of the Detroit Free Press and now professor of journalism at the University of Arizona . <P> " Up to the Daisies . " The Epitaph was founded in 1880 by Tucson Publisher John P. Clum , who soon devised a handy way of handling Tombstone 's bloody gun fights and other occasions of sudden death . He listed them under a stock head : DEATH 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories sometimes read like the dime novels of the day . Sample : " The lurking fiend , who had secreted himself with hell in his heart and death in his mind , drew deadly aim and dropped his victim dead in his tracks . " The Epitaph 's prize headline : <P> " BILLY THE KID " + <P> TAKES A SHOT AT " BUCKSKIN FRANK " <P> THE LATTER PROMPTLY REPLIED <P> AND THE FORMER QUIETLY TURNS HIS TOES <P> UP TO THE DAISIES . <P> Tombstone 's life was not all blood &; thunder . The Epitaph often crooked a little finger and wrote of its Grand Hotel , where , " to crown all , each room has windows " ; the elegant Tombstone Club , whose " chairs , cuspadores and curtains are of the same general color as the carpet " ; the Alhambra , where " an orchestra of three pieces discusses the latest and most fashionable music " ; and the Oriental , " the most elegantly furnished saloon this side of the . . . Golden Gate . " <P> Heart Failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local baseball team . Wrote he , on the team 's trip to " Phenix " : " . . . the nine that journeyed to a strange land , glorying in their strength and mighty in their boastfulness , were beaten and utterly routed . . . and their raiment of purple and fine linen was grievously soiled . " The only thing missing in his account : the score . <P> The Epitaph never worried about libel ( it once charged a competing paper with blackmail ) or the feelings of its readers . " The remains of the late Kiv Phillips , " it reported in 1882 , " were . . . not well embalmed and the stench was beginning to get so great it was feared the express company would not ship the body . " Another local brief : " James Fair Jr . is dead . It was the same old story of heart failure , which is another name for alcoholism . " <P> The Epitaph also had a strong crusading voice . It campaigned for years to get a railroad into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It staunchly upheld the statehood movement for Arizona , and took the side of law &; order against such outlaws as John Ringo and Billy Claiborne . ( For this stand , Editor Clum narrowly missed being shot. )
