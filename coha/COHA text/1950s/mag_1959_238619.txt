Odds Against Tomorrow ( HarBel ; <P> United Artists ) is a thriller that makes a peculiar plea for racial integration in the underworld . The hero ( Harry Belafonte , who is also the producer ) is a singer in a Harlem hotspot who signs on for a bank robbery to pay off his bookie . Unhappily , once he is in , he discovers that another member of the gang is a paranoid punk from Oklahoma ( Robert Ryan ) who would sooner risk the bundle than his sense of white supremacy . The punk calls the Negro " Brother Bones , " and warns him not to " crap out " on the job . " Ah been handlin ' Negroes all mah life . He 's no diff'ent because he 's got him a twenty-dollah pair a shoes . " <P> The tension builds well to the climax-thanks partly to Director Robert Wise ( I Want to Live ! ) , partly to an able Negro scriptwriter named John O. Killens , but mostly to Actor Ryan , a menace who can look bullets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too soon-and much too trickily . The spectator is left with a feeling that is aptly expressed in the final frame of the film , when the camera focuses on a street sign that reads : STOP-DEAD END . <P> <P> The Last Angry Man ( Columbia ) , the hero of Gerald Green 's cinemadaptation of his bestselling novel , is a cranky , kindly , old-fashioned family doctor with the sort of character that practice makes perfect . Dr. Sam Abelman ( Paul Muni ) lives and works in one of the worst neighborhoods in Brooklyn , loves and cares for his patients day and night , though most of them are too ignorant to appreciate him and too poor to pay his bills . The thing <P> Dr. Sam hates most is " the new age , the age of the galoot , the fast buck , the something-for-nothing crowd , " and he goes out of his way to give every phony he sees a piece of his sharp mind . <P> As long as the picture tells Sam 's story , it is pleasantly entertaining . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prowl ( 1953 ) was his last picture-and the folksy , matzo-barrel humor is fun . Unfortunately , the picture tells Sam 's story for only 20 minutes or so . The rest of the time ( about 80 minutes ) the audience watches a big wheel ( David Wayne ) go round in circles trying to get Sam to appear on television and talk pretty for the people . Sam himself makes the only adequate comment on all this . He gets so sick and tired of the television types that he drops dead . <P> The Best of Everything ( 20th Century-Fox ) , based on Rona Jaffe 's bestselling novel ( TIME . Sept. 15 , 1958 ) , tells what happens to the bright young things from college that come wriggling down to Manhattan to get in The Big Swim . They land in The Typing Pool . And from there , it is only another wriggle to The Flesh Pot . Compared with the hot buttered Manhattan of Authoress Jaffe 's imagination , the Hollywood version of the big city is a sort of cautiously diluted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with appalling celerity in this sinister mixture . <P> Career Girl No. 1 ( Hope Lange ) is a Radcliffe grad who goes to work for a paperback publisher and in the evening takes a postgraduate course in premarital relations at the Plaza Hotel . When she discovers that the course only leads to a mistress ' degree , she decides to concentrate on her career and eke out her love life with an alcoholic editor of teen topics ( Stephen Boyd ) .
