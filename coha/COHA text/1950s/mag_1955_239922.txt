To the Communist press , all news can be led down the party line , though it often takes considerable leading . Thus , in East Germany last week , when a circus tiger mauled its trainer , Potsdam 's Mrkische Volksstimme ( circ. 240,000 ) saw a fine opportunity . Said Volksstimme ( Voice of the People ) : " The tiger 's attack was one of the many interesting episodes of Franchesco Capri 's eventful circus life ... In November his wife Ruth will present six young lions she brought from Hungary in a new act , ' Animal Nursery . ' But before she can do this she has to work hard training them for many months . This work can only be successful if we are able to preserve peace . Therefore , we must bring about the downfall of the Paris accords , for these , and this fact was confirmed by Franchesco Capri , are much more dangerous than a whole group of tigers .
