In New Brunswick , N.J. last week , Post 133 of the Jewish War Veterans volunteered to supply substitutes for Christians who would otherwise have to work on Christmas Day . First requests to come in were for twelve movie-theater ushers and three restaurant waitresses . " There are no conditions attached to the offer and we shall accept no compensation , " explained the post 's spokesman , Harold Berman . " Our sole reward will be the knowledge that we have been able , in a small way , to express our gratitude for the splendid relationship that exists between the Jewish members of our community and our Christian neighbors. "
