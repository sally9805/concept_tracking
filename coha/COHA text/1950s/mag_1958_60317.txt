The day I was elected captain of the Columbia University basketball team , I went home and ate a mustard sandwich for dinner . That 's all we could afford . " This is George Gregory talking . In 1931 he became the first Negro All-America basketball player in the history of the game . Gregory , a tall , distinguished 51-year-old who is now a Commissioner of Civil Service in New York City , was discussing the rise of the Negro in intercollegiate sport , a rise which is nowhere more dramatically demonstrated than on this year 's college basketball scene . As the various All-America selections for 1958 are made , it is increasingly evident that the five best college players in the country are all Negroes  --  Guy Rodgers of Temple , Oscar Robertson of Cincinnati , Wilt Chamberlain of Kansas , Elgin Baylor of Seattle and Bob Boozer of Kansas State . And a second All-America five , all Negro , could just as easily be John Green of Michigan State , Tom Hawkins of Notre Dame , Gene Brown of San Francisco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio ) . // It is George Gregory 's conviction that one of the big reasons for this phenomenon is the fact that the average Negro family is no longer living on mustard sandwiches . // There are , of course , other reasons and the chief of these is that basketball itself is only now achieving status as a first-rank sport on campus . Today most major colleges offer full scholarships to young men who , in addition to qualifying academically , are good basketball players . Only a few years ago competition for athletes was limited to football men but as schools have begun to appreciate the prestige ( and , yes , the money-making potential ) that comes with winning basketball , the bidding for good shooters has become as hectic as the scramble for halfbacks . This increased opportunity for a free education has been an incentive for all athletes  --  white and Negro  --  but for the Negro it came at almost the precise time when he was being welcomed in ever-greater numbers anyway by the larger universities . At the average state college 20 full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at those schools where there are no racial bars the Negro is getting his share of the scholarships . // It is also true that basketball has always been popular among those who can not afford the equipment for football , baseball , tennis and other sports . Even in Gregory 's day when , as he puts it , " we had to play on cold , dark basement courts where you had to dribble around a furnace to take a shot , " there were excellent Negro amateur and professional teams . The old Renaissance squads of the 1920s and ' 30s , whose games with the Original Celtics were classics of competition , were perhaps the finest all-Negro teams the game has ever known . And today , in integrated schools , playgrounds , settlement houses and YMCAs , good courts and expert coaching are available to the young Negro athlete . // There remains , finally , the seldom-expressed yet inescapable fact which conceivably dominates all others . Basketball is a team game  --  a symbol to the Negro , when he plays it , of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Negro enjoys a deep psychological thrill from playing in a mixed group . He has a sense of belonging , of being wanted and needed and of making a contribution . " // Paving the way for racial amity may not be the least of sport 's own contributions .
