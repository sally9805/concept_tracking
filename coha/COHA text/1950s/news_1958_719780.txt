txt How much can auto makers afford to pay their workers in higher wages and fringe benefits without giving the price spiral another upward twist ? Although this question has been all but obscured in the public 's mind by the game of wits and economic strength being played by Walter Reuther 's United Auto Workers and the auto industry in current labor negotiations , it is at he heart of the dispute in the bargaining rooms . The general formula for determining the answer , important not only to the auto industry but to the economy as a whole , already has been accepted by both sides . Real wages , they say , should rise at the same rate as the annual gain in national productivity  --  which is the gross national product for the private sector of the economy ( adjusted for the changing value of the dollar ) divided by the total man-hours worked in the private economy . As a General Motors official puts it : " it IS possible for the average hourly earnings of the nation 's workers to increase as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing inflation and without giving labor all the benefits of the nation 's productivity improvement . This fact is frequently misunderstood . " " Short-Changed " Since 1140 The U.A.W. 's acceptance of the principle is qualified , by its determination to make up a portion of the amount it claims it has been " short-changed " on productivity gains since 1940 , but it has agreed publicly that it will go along with this formula . From this agreement , it would seem but a short step to coming to terms on a contract to replace the three-year document signed in 1955 . Nothing , however , could be farther from the case . In fact , this accord has merely been the starting point for the " great debate " of the negotiations thus far ? an argument that may yet spill over into a public fight . Why ? Because G.M. and the other auto makers assert that the annual productivity gain on which benefits must be based is something under 2 1% ? less than the 2 5% automatic yearly wage adjustment in the present contract . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to say the figure is above the 3,9% cited as the post-war trend in President Eisenhower 's economic message to Congress this year . In official union documents secured by The Wall Street Journal , however , it claims the annual inci ease " might be 4 1% or 4 2% , even higher . " The importance of resolving these figures is obvious in the auto negotiations , but it does not end there More and mole companies and industries are turning to the so-called " improvement factor " to determine across-theboard pay hikes General Electric Co , for one , recently circulated a special bulletin on the subject to as supervisory personnel taking the G.M aide of the auto industry dispute So widespread has become the practice of tying wages to productivity gains . in fact , that Bureau of Labor Statistics director Ewan S. Clague has complained publicly that his agency 's studies in this field were designed as an economist 's tool  --  not a precise gauge for dollars-and-cents pay boosts . Mr. Clague once took much the same attitude . however , with respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no avail . As in the case of the cost-of-living index , the productivity adjustment for wage increases seems destined to become a standard feature of many labor contracts across the country . Determination of the proper figure to be used thus becomes vital indeed . the negotiators ; included these basic assertions : The only valid productivity measurement is the long-term trend  --  the longer , the better . Therefore , the post-war trend line should be discarded and one which shows the trend since 1909 ( first year for which comparable date is available ) should be used . This line indicates the average yearly gains 21% . The productivity gain does not all stem from real gains in output . Part of it is statistical , and stems from shifts of workers from lowproductivity areas such as farming to highproductivity areas such as manufacturing , Union 's Rebuttal To this , according to a copy of a union presentation which formed the basis of Mr. Weinberg 's five-hour rebuttal , the U A.W . economist replied in part : 1 . Productivity gains , because of rapidlyadvancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , by averaging the increases since 1909 and thus plotting the increases for this period as a straight line , assumes what it is setting out to prove  --  that there has been no acceleration in the annual rate of productivity rise . The proper trend line is an ascending curve which shows that productivity since World War II has gone up faster than it did in the early years of this century . The B.L.S. straight-line trend of 3 9% since 1947 corroborates this . 2 . The 3.9% figure is too low because , out of 10 identifiable errors which tend to distort productivity measurement up or down , only two push it upward . The other eight are inclined to lower the figure . 3 . The effect of shifts from one occupational group to the other does not act only to raise productivity and wage rate averages It also works the other way as workers shift from jobs of higher productivity and pay to lower levels . To sum up General Motors ' case , Mr. Upson reiterated that the only valid measurements of productivity gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This , he added , is already more than taken care of by the " improvement factor " wage hikes of 2.5% a year in the auto industry 's present contract  --  a clause which the companies have offered to extend unchanged . Moreover , the G M. economist stated , union gains in every year since the wage formula was put into effect have exceeded the " allowable " increases equal to productivity gains . The effect , he asserted , has been constantly increasing labor costs and resultant price hikes by the auto makers Mr Weinberg , according to the U A.W document , rejected this completely The wage increases granted the union in 1948 , he said , merely brought the average worker 's pay level up from 1940 by the same amount in which the cost-of-living had risen . One hour of work , in other words . yielded him no more purchasing power than it had eight years previously . Although wages were adjusted to compensate him for inflation , he received no real gains to reflect the rise in productivity between 1940 and 1948 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the ' real ' hourly earnings of auto workers ( earnings in terms of buying power ) increased by only 29.9% , while productivity in the economy increased 67.5% . " Acceptance Unlikely It is this gap to which Mr. Reuther refers when he says the union is entitled to recover a portion of the amount it has been " shortchanged " since 1940 . He has asserted that some of this money can be put into such things as pension ' improvement without adding to inflationary pressures and has said the union will voluntarily give up any such gain if the companies prove it would force an increase in auto prices . Since it would involve a " look at the books " ? something Mr. Reuther has long sought ? it 's unlikely any of the car makers will take up his offer . With the unusual set of circumstances governing the auto industry today , it 's fair to expect that the productivity debate will not settle the contract issues in his year 's contract . The 1958 pact will more probably be based on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The argument , however , will go on ? not only in the Motor City but in dozens of other cities where labor contracts are hammered out What calculation will finally be accepted as the standard figure on productivity increases is impossible to guess . But , whatever estimate wins out  --  assuming the argument ever is resolved or a pattern established  --  its application will affect the American economy for many years to come . Definitions and Agreements Before examining the arguments put forth by both sides in the bargaining rooms , a definition of productivity and an illustration of the wage adjustment principle to which union and management have agreed may be in order . Productivity , as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for purposes of determining the upward trend , is the private gross national product ( total value of goods and services produced by the entire economy , less wages paid to all government employes ) in terms of 1947 dollars divided by the total number of manhours worked by employes in the private economy . In 1956 , last year for which final figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deduction of government pay rut this to $378 6 billion . Adjusted to eliminate inflation since 1947. the figure was $308 billion . The total of farm and non-farm man-hours worked , in 1958 , according to the B L S , was 120 9 billion . This yielded an average productivity of $2 55 per man-hour . By comparison , the private G.N.P . figure in 1947 was $215.6 billion  --  a figure that need not be . adjusted for price changes since it is taken for the base year . There were 116 7 billion man-hours worked in the private economy that year , so the productivity figure derived was $185 per man-hour . In the nine years from 1917 to 1956 , therefore , the productivity of the statistically average worker rose by 37.9% . A trend line of the individual yearly gains attained in this period ( determined by commonly . accepted statistical means ) produces the 3.9% post-war average cited in the President 's report . Here , in greatly simplified form , is why workers ' pay can rise as fast as productivity : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a month is $600 , and to *turn out this amount he must work 150 hours , his productivity is $4 an hour If his wage rate is $2 an hour , his total pay for the month is $300 or half the value of his production . The re ? mainder goes to the other factors of production ? such as profit , interest , etc . Output , Pay May Double If , by the addition of new equipment or the application of new techniques , the same worker is enabled to produce $1,200 worth of the same goods in the same time and with the same physical effort , his productivity is doubled . Under the circumstances , his pay can also be doubled ( from $4 an hour ) and yet his wages will still constitute only half the cost of the product . Profit on each unit also remains the same , moreover , and prices need not rise . With this background , what are the cases that can be made for the conflicting claims of G.M. and the U.A.W. about which figureless than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used to set the pattern of wage increases ? For an answer , let 's examine In detail the actual arguments made in the bargaining room by Brent T. Upson , a slender , bespectacled 32-year-old G.M. economist , and by Nat Weinberg , 44 , the crew-cut , chain-smoking veteran of 11 years as the II.A.W. ' s chief economist .
