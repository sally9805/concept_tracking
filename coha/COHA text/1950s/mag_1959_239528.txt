If any one of you would like to ask questions that would reflect what I would name-ah-funny ideas about things , I would be glad in answering them . " <P> After a surprised pause the 150 newsmen , used to having celebrities duck tough questions instead of invite them , began firing from the hip . The Shah shrugged off possibilities of a revolution ( " the line adopted by Moscow radio " ) . But he frankly admitted that some tribal chiefs opposed him , although he had recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying as much . Asked about his blacklist of correspondents , the Shah said , " I wonder if even Mr. Sam Pope Brewer could not return to Iran . " <P> Inevitably came the question about the Shah 's widely publicized search for a new wife . Was it true he had as many as " three or four " matrimonial prospects in mind ?
