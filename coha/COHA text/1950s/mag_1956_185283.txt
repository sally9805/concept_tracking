The two-engined Ilyushin plane bearing Soviet Premier Bulganin and First Party Secretary Khrushchev had hardly cleared the mountains ringing Kabul when Afghanistan 's Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud Khan called a press conference . Daoud 's message to the West : no secret political or military pacts had been made with the Soviet Union , and Afghanistan 's policy of neutrality was unchanged . The $100 million credit extended to Afghanistan by the departing Russians would be used for peaceful projects , i.e. , hydroelectric power , irrigation , etc . In effect , said Daoud , Afghanistan is still free " to shop " with the West . The hint was heavily underlined : the Afghans , who like to think of themselves as the Orient 's wiliest wheeler-dealers , were inviting the U.S. ( which has already granted Afghanistan credits amounting to some $50 million ) to outbid the Communists . <P> Guns for Sale . In New Delhi , Daoud 's remarks were taken with a grain of sodium chloride . The city buzzed with the news that an Afghan arms-buying mission would soon be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet arms would get into the hands of Afghanistan 's border-raiding Pathan tribesmen . Thus the Soviet Traveling Salesmen sought to punish the West 's good friend Pakistan . Having endorsed India 's claims to Kashmir ( disputed by Pakistan ) , they now encouraged the Afghans ' claim to northern territories of West Pakistan . <P> Prime Minister Nehru , however , was having a few third thoughts . A few days after the departure of the Russians , he told a closed meeting of the Indian Congress Party that he had been " embarrassed " by their speechmaking while in India , and described Khrushchev 's charge that the Western allies had sent Hitler against the Soviet Union in 1941 as " twisting history . " He has still to say as much in public . <P> Friends Won . At Moscow Central Airport , bundled to their ears in thick fur coats , Bulganin and Khrushchev hurried from their homecoming plane to an arc-lighted platform , told Russia 's radio and TV audience that it had been a " wonderful trip . " Said Khrushchev : " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of Burma and Afghanistan , we have allies in the struggle for peace throughout the world . . . India is a great and good friend of our country . Just like the Soviet Union and the Chinese People 's Republic . India stands firmly in the ranks of the struggle for peace . And India , China and the Soviet Union-as Lenin taught-constitute an invincible force . " <P> Although neither India , Burma nor Afghanistan are colonies , Khrushchev lashed out at " colonialism . " " In our speeches in India , Burma and Afghanistan , we exposed the criminal policy of the colonizers . " In contrast to Khrushchev , Marshal Bulganin acted like a tired old man . <P> The streets from the airport were lined with Red army soldiers and tens of thousands of dark-clad Muscovites , who stood in the sub-zero cold , craning their necks for a glimpse of the official entourage . Among those welcoming the " peacemakers " were a number of top-level bureaucrats just back from viewing a series of thermonuclear explosions * in north Siberia . Together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week 's special meeting of the Supreme Soviet . Though the welcome was vast , it was silent ; no one in the streets cheered . <P>
