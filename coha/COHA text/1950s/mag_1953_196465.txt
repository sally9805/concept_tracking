Do the graduates of girls ' colleges hunt jobs the wrong way ? Bernice Fitz-Gibbon , advertising director of Manhattan 's Gimbels department store ( " Nobody but nobody undersells Gimbels " ) thinks they do . Last week , speaking in Manhattan to the deans and placement directors of 100 women 's colleges , Adwoman Fitz-Gibbon , who can make Broadway slang sell girdles , gave them some breezy advice on job-hunting . <P> " First , " she began , " aim high in your appeal . . . Get in touch directly . . . with the top industrial giants . You know . . . someone who can take three hours for lunch . . . Now what is that type of employer looking for in a secretary ? Shorthand speed ? Dependability ? Industry ? Do n't be silly ! First and foremost , he 's looking for a LOOKER ... Of course , this preoccupation with pulchritude on the part of the employer may not be noble and high-minded . . . But there it is . . . It 's sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what to do ? Well , you select an appetizing package with a good profile all the way and a face like an old Gainsborough . . . You might develop a few slogans to put across your more exciting products : <P> HERE 'S HOLYOKE 'S HOTTEST . . . <P> HANDLE WITH ASBESTOS GLOVES <P> BARNARD GRADUATES <P> HAVE THE EQUIPMENT <P> SMITH GIRLS ARE GIRLIER GIRLS <P> " Does this mean that every top executive ... is a lecherous old wolf ? ... Of course it does n't . Your graduates will be perfectly safe . . . But it does mean that your intelligent , attractive girl will have a well-paid job till she marries . . . Your lovely looker will move into a stuffy tycoon 's office and unstuff the stuffy . " <P> The big trouble today , concluded Adwoman Fitz-Gibbon , is that too many college placement bureaus never dream of putting their brightest liberal-arts graduates into " lush " secretarial jobs or the retail-store business , but send them into " fusty , dusty publishing houses ... I think the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its graduates in jobs of that type-is because of our American Puritanical background . If it was hard and dull and did n't pay much , it was good for you , and the harder and duller and littler it paid , the more respectable it must be . I do n't agree . There 's nothing immoral about getting into the big money . Sophie Tucker said : ' I 've been poor and I 've been rich . And believe me , rich is best . ' "
