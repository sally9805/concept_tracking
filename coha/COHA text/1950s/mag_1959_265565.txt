It was one of the strangest union meetings to be found anywhere . Ranged on one side of a bitter leadership battle was a fading movie actress supported by her floor leader and lieutenant , a goateed mind reader . On the opposite side was a former nightclub pitchman supported by fire-eaters , sword-swallowers and comics . As a flock of Washington reporters perched outside the Pall Mall Room of the Hotel Raleigh , the annual meeting of the American Guild of Variety Artists grew as raucous as anything that ever happened on a carny midway . <P> At real and serious issue was the conduct of Jackie Bright , the M.C. who rose from the floor of obscure nightclubs to the $25,000-a-year post of administrative secretary of null a 13,000-member union made up of vaudevillians , circus performers and miscellaneous nightclub entertainers ( ranging from Red Skelton at $40,000 per week to a chorus boy at $75 ) . Sporting pearl tie pin , jeweled cuff links and charcoal-grey suit , Bright quickly earned a reporter 's nickname , " Blackie . " Against him stood Blondie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-election as A.G.V.A. president . Said she , weepily : " I 'm just a little 114-lb. girl going in there alone . " <P> The most serious question : had there been an off-to-Buffalo shuffle with A.G.V.A. sick and relief funds ? Member contributions are recorded only by number , not by name , so that only Bright and his staff can decipher who deserves what . In addition , a separate corporation called the A.G.V.A. Foundation , headed by busy Jackie Bright , last year bought 62 acres of land in the Catskills , plus assorted buildings , announced that this was the new retreat for retired A.G.V.A. members . So far no A.G.V.A. member has retired there . Asked one critic : " What kind of a home is it up there in the hills ? You need overcoats , underwear and everything else . What are they going to do in the winter-sit in the basement and watch TV ? " <P> Secretary Bright denied all charges , shouted that his staff had been " pretty good crucified in here by dirty innuendoes . " The Blondie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be counted . In the meantime , Senator John McClellan confirmed that his Labor Rackets Committee has been taking a look at A.G.V.A. For the moment , Crusader Singleton seemed to have the last word . Said she about her opponents : " I have a national reputation as a housekeeper , but I resent having to clean out their kind of mud . "
