In Washington last week , the U.S. Navy issued a pious pronouncement . It had banned From Here to Eternity , a movie about sex , sadism and misery in the pre-World War II Army , because the film is " derogatory to a brother service . " The Navy took this solicitous stand despite the fact that the Army-Air Force Motion Picture Service had already approved the movie . Said Brigadier General Frank Dorn , the Army 's deputy chief of information : " The general reaction at the end is good for the Army . " <P> This quick journey from somewhere to inconsistency left Army-Navy relations about the same as ever . Anonymous Navy spokesmen , chuckling deeply , thought that the Army could n't possibly ban the movie from its screens because it had spent a lot of the taxpayers ' money helping to produce scenes at Hawaii 's Schofield Barracks . Anonymous Army spokesmen , with a knowing air , thought that the Navy ( which has joined the Roman Catholic Legion of Decency in banning The Moon Is Blue ) might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Caine Mutiny , a movie about sex , misery and a fumbling Annapolis-bred skipper , which the Navy may want to ban from all the ships at sea .
