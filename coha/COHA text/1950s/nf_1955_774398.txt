txt  | boxes was a rusty tin can , hidden in an isolated spot in a suburb of the Swedish capital . Sometimes the systems of communication used seem to have been borrowed from the more sensational type of boy 's fiction . One of the Scandinavian networks was found to be using a system in which hairpins were hung on a wire fence in various shapes to convey messages and point to a letter box , recalling the chalk marks made by tramps and gypsies to indicate whether a householder is generous or keeps a dog . At one time Soviet agents favored using public libraries , where they marked reference books according to a prearranged code to be read hours or days later by another person . This method seems to have been abandoned after some exposures , although in the nature of things it is impossible for the counterintelligence to scrutinize all the millions of books in the public libraries of great cities like London or New York . And yet , one spy was caught in the last war as a result of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a directory and communicating with counterintelligence . In describing Soviet espionage to the Canadian Royal Commission , Gouzenko said : They would not use just one method ; they used a combination of all methods . They are always saying never to put all your aspirations and hopes on one method . They say that life is very complicated , so use everything possible . They would combine this method of infiltration , outside help , sympathizers , and others .. . Examining the records of Soviet secret agents at work , we have plenty of evidence of the great variety of their methods and techniques . At one and the same time they would be trying an ideological approach , persuasion , bribery , and even straight burglary . We have attempts at direct observation by agents going round the country under the guise of helping immigrants , and of blackmail , eavesdropping , and infiltration . In the same way , although certain basic principles run through the techniques of communication between agents , an immense variety of methods is employed . Some of them seem  | quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spy stories . But they are used because they are successful . The number of cases in which agents are detected " in the act , " like those of Pupyshev and Gudkov in Britain , which I describe later , are small compared to the cases where detection has only followed the successful operation of the spy net for years . If anyone believes that the Soviet secret service methods are so complex and elaborate that they have become almost absurd and too cumbersome for the agents to be effective , he should realize that even in cases of grave damage to Soviet networks , such as in Canada and Australia , the effect was strictly limited chiefly because of these methods . Employing the cutout system , using the complicated methods in arranging meetings and , above all , providing parallel networks , which act as watertight compartments of an Avanpost hit by the torpedo of a defection or exposure , the Soviet secret service succeeded in providing protection for the organizations and for individual agents . Even when they wished to assist , men who had defected or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limited amount of information because of the elaborate system the Soviet secret service maintains . Fuchs was unable to identify the courier in the United States who had met him a number of times or , indeed , to give any real clue to his identity , and it was , in the end , only a combination of dogged persistence and one mistake made by Gold that enabled the FBI to bring home a case against him and unravel some of the tangled skein of his network which included Greenglass and the Rosenbergs . Fuchs was not able to identify the courier who met him in England after his return from the United States . Even with Gouzenko 's " gift from the gods " of a pile of documents , the Canadian authorities after intense work lasting six months were able to identify and arrest only some of those in the network for which Gouzenko was cipher clerk . Other networks known to exist continued to operate and have never been unmasked . The use of code names in Zabotin 's exposed network was ex- tremely effective in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape . It was not until January , 1953 , almost eight years after the exposure of the atomic spy rings in Canada and the United States , that Montreal police discovered by chance that at least one " parallel " network continued its activities in Canada quite undisturbed , when members of the Zabotin network stood trial . On January 5 , 1953 , a 6o-year-old native of Greece , Constantin Stathapoulus , who had lived in Canada since 1927 , was found dead in his home in Montreal . He had died after a long illness and there was no suggestion of foul play . In a well-hidden cache were found steel boxes containing hundreds of documents , which the head of the antisubversive division of the Canadian police , Mr. Louis Champagne , described as " the most important collection of espionage documents found in Montreal . " Notebooks containing references to several persons involved in the Canadian spy ring , as well as to Fuchs , were , found . Almost all the records and notes were written in code , based on the Greek language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents . But from such information as they could piece together , it became clear that Stathapoulus had in his possession part of the archives of a Soviet espionage network which was quite independent from that of Zabotin 's , but which had pursued at least some " targets " related to atomic espionage . The authorities then discovered that the dead man had been involved in espionage activities under the alias of " Costapoulus " and " Costa , " and that the police had been looking for him for three years . The methods which keep the many Soviet agents as apart from each other as possible , have provided many unsolved ? and apparently insoluble ? puzzles for Western counterintelligence . To give only one example : In June , 1953 , detectives of Scotland Yard 's Special Branch arrested a man who in November , 1952 , had come to lodge in a modest guest house in the Pimlico area of London . To the manageress he gave his name as Dr. Geoffrey Noble , mentioned that he was 34 years old and that he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a most agreeable and quiet tenant . Then , almost eight months after his arrival , detectives inquired at the guest house after a Mr. Colin Ward , and from the descriptions given they identified Dr. Noble as the wanted man . He was taken to the Gerald Road police station , Westminster . Twelve hours later he was found hanged in his cell . The man was arrested because Scotland Yard and M.I.5 had been informed from abroad that an important Soviet agent had entered Britain in November of 1952 . They found the man who fitted the description eight months later . In his room at the guest house they also found four British passports . They were all genuine and all bore the photographs of the arrested man . But in one of the photographs he wore spectacles , in a second he was almost bald , in the third he had a full head of hair . The passports had been issued by various British authorities in the names of Dr. Noble , Ward , and Morris . When he was arrested , he refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M.I.5 officers , he had committed suicide . He was never identified , and although he spoke English without a trace of a foreign accent , Scotland Yard were wondering whether the dead man was , in fact , a native of Britain . His activities during his eight months ' stay in Britain remained shrouded in mystery . Another characteristic of the Soviet secret service in action is its generous expenditure . It has never had to worry about money , like the secret services of democratic countries . In Britain there is an annual vote in the House of Commons for the Secret Service , and while this is traditionally passed without debate in detail , it is certain that questions would be asked if the sum demanded were a very large one . More important , the strict system of controlling in detail the expenditure of all government departments in Britain and the U.S.A. means it is impossible to hide large sums spent on secret service in other appropriations . But this is certainly done in the U.S.S.R. , where the secret service has not been under pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite apart from the  | many millions required to pay the salaries of its legions of agents . At the trials of the discovered traitor spies , their defending counsel have almost invariably suggested in mitigation , " at least they did not do it for money , " and generally this has been accepted by the court and the public . It may be true that in most cases money was not the original or even the main motive for treachery , but examination of the figures suggests the sums paid by the Cheka were too large to be dismissed as " not mattering , " and small only in relation to the value of the secrets they purchased . Moreover , there can never be conclusive evidence that the sums which came to light were the only ones paid . We find Greenglass getting $500 in one lump sum and later being handed ten times this sum to facilitate his escape as if it were of no great moment . Sam Carr was authorized to receive $3000 for a faked passport ? he asked $5000 but this was refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month . Whitaker Chambers , when he went underground , was given money to , buy " bourgeois " clothes and received $loo a month and expenses , a useful salary 20 years ago . In most cases the Cheka was dealing with men prepared to make sacrifices and probably not earning more before recruitment . Alfred Dean Slack , one of the men from whom Gold collected information and who was sentenced to 15 years , received $200 for each report . With the depreciation of money the prices the Soviet secret service has been prepared to pay have gone up ? Petrov has spoken of making payments of up to ? 500 for a single piece of information . The records from the Ottawa embassy were not complete and related to a comparatively short time , but contained numerou entries of the type : " Handed out $ioo ; he took the mone readily , " " Gave $ioo ( present for the wife ) , " and so on . At on point Zabotin was asking Moscow , with confidence , for mor money to be sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having spent $2500 on the diplomatic mail alone in tw months . The case of Rabinowitch showed that the Soviet mil .  | itary intelligence in Canada could produce $io , 000 at short notice without difficulty . All the sums we know about came to light accidentally , so to speak , and must represent only a small fraction of the real total . It is a basic routine of agents of the Soviet secret service , when dealing with an amateur , to make him accept money as soon as possible . The key is given in Bykov 's cynical remark : " Who pays is the boss and who takes the money must also give something . " It seems to be standard practice not to demand a receipt on the first occasion , but to get one later , not to undertake a particular piece of work . The reaction to the offer of money by informants recruited by ideological appeal varies from " taking it readily " to being genuinely " insulted " that they should be offered a reward for work they were doing because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes given a " present . " The Rosenbergs received watches and a console table , and it will be recalled that a " reward rug " figured extensively in the Alger Hiss trial ? one of four bought for the purpose for $1000 . The freedom with which the Soviet spy networks consider spending money is shown by their willingness to make longterm investments . Zabotin asked Moscow with some confidence about investing in a geological engineering business which would become a " cover " for postwar activities . The sums to be paid to " Gray " would be : rent $600 a year ; wages of clerk $1200 a year ; office equipment $i000 ; payment to the director $4200 a year . Altogether this setup would have cost $14,000 in the two years . During 1938 and 1939 the Soviet secret service paid $Goo toward the technical education of Gold at their own suggestion . Rosenberg told Greenglass after the war he was confident the Russians would pay for him to go the University of Chicago as they were paying for quite a number of men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for information received or to invest in the hope of getting it .   Soviet agents are entrusted with money , naturally in cash , to give to others without , apparently , any check other than their reports . This may suggest that the unscrupulous agent could easily enrich himself . I have come across no evidence of this happening and it is probably rare . A Soviet agent enriching himself in this way would be unable , or at least afraid , to spend the money , knowing that he himself was being watched by his fellow Russians and that any sign of being " flush " would arouse suspicion . Nor would he be able to carry the money back to the Soviet Union . The temptation probably does not occur because of his training and because he is generously paid , holding what the majority of his countrymen would consider an enviable position . And lastly , I believe that the majority of the Soviet agents are sincere , firmly believing they are doing honorable work for their country and Communism . The mention of Zabotin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises a point of interest ? the relationship between the true Soviet diplomats , and particularly the ambassador , and the " diplomats " sent primarily for espionage . The Canadian Royal Commission acquitted the Soviet ambassador of having any part in the " inadmissible activities , " as Soviet espionage was called in the days of the honeymoon with Russia . The ordinary man may find it incredible that a highly intelligent man like a Soviet ambassador could be altogether unaware of the presence in his embassy of rooms with steel-lined doors to which he had no access , or even a considerable number of " diplomats " who were certainly not assisting him in diplomacy . In the case of the Soviet ambassador in Australia , it seems clear from Petrov 's evidence that he was aware of why Petrov had been sent and what he was , doing . But it is certainly also true that Moscow on principle forbids the heads of its diplomatic missions taking any direct part in espionage or its organization . Zabotin telegraphed Mos-cow : To the Director . I was scolded for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Embassy proper '  | I beg you to advise me what material is concerned . I have informed the boss of Metro on political , economic , and military questions in accordance with instructions given to me by the chief director and by comrade Malenkov . The sources are never reported by me . Please instruct for the future . Am I to inform the boss on questions concerning Canada which are received from sources ? It seems to me that the boss of Metro should be the bestinformed person . The " boss of Metro " was code for the Soviet ambassador . Moscow 's reply was : 1 . In telegram No. 8267 of June 20 you were given instructions on the inadmissibility of disclosing our agency network to the ambassador . The handing over to the ambassador by you of the Wilgress report of 11.3.44 concerning financial credits to insure trade between the U.S.S.R. and Great Britain after the war , in the very form in which it was received , has uncovered the existence of our source on the object of ELLIE . Furthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inasmuch as the document was in the local language . 2 . With regard to urgent political and economic questions affecting the mutual relations of Canada and Great Britain with the U.S.S.R. you must keep the embassy informed , but indicate only that the source is authentic without revealing to him either the source itself or the places from which the information is obtained . 3 . The information should be handed over after it has already been prepared to this effect , deleting all messages which might disclose the secret source . 4 . All questions on which you are informing the ambassador you are under obligations to bring to my attention in the comments on your informational reports . It is clear that Moscow 's policy of keeping the ambassador " clean " is based not on regard for diplomatic conventions but rather because of the danger to the security of the spy network involved . During the last few years this has been stressed even more emphatically by the Cheka directorates in instructions to   Resident Directors and top agents abroad . Even though many Cheka agents are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the genuine diplomats . Only one or two of the agents who were listed as majors , captains , and lieutenants in the Canadian embassy had ever been officers in the Red Army . Their military titles were those of the NKVD corps , indicating their rank in the Cheka . A door guard and a chauffeur both held the rank of " captains . " It is therefore quite understandable that a Soviet ambassador may have on his staff " diplomats " and " military attaches " whose real names he may not know and of whose work he knows nothing . Neither is the ambassador in a position to decode any of the ' , messages , either incoming or outgoing , which are exchanged between a Cheka man on his staff and the Moscow headquarters of the Soviet secret service . As far as I could ascertain , in 1954 the Soviet diplomats abroad used five different code systems , each having , of course , many variations . These systems were quite separately devised for : Agents of the First Directorate of the MVD . Agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Military Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense Agents of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . Agents of the Ministry of External Trade ( employed in Sovie trade delegations , if not members of the first two categories ) .  | The theft by Soviet secret agents of the most carefully guarded secrets of the atom bomb as revealed at the trial of Dr. Nunn May , Klaus Fuchs , and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg has been reported and discussed so often during the last few years that the story hardly requires retelling in detail . But the emphasis has always been on the " traitors " rather than those who used them and it is worth while considering ? from the viewpoint of the Soviet secret service ? the events that , as Judge Kauffman told the Rosenbergs , " have already altered the course of history . " At the time war broke out in 1939 there was no secret about the potentialities of atomic fission as a military weapon . They had been freely discussed by physicists for more than a decade . The rulers in the Kremlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had worked for many years under Lord Rutherford at the Cavendish Laboratory , Cambridge , but never returned from Russia after a visit in 1935 . Stalin must have been no less aware of the possibilities than the war leaders in the West . Two factors may have decided Soviet policy on the develop- ment of atomic weapons . First , the technical and industrial resources of the U.S.S.R. , especially after the success of the German invasion , were fully taxed in defending the country and were insufficient to undertake the program of research and development essential for turning the potentialities of atomic fission into an actual weapon . It was a gamble that an atom bomb could be made at all and even Britain with her much greater technical resources took the decision in 1941 with some misgivings . Secondly , the atomic bomb , even if the effort were successful , might come too late to play a decisive part in the war . In reality it did come too late to be used against Germany , already on her knees before the first bomb was tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning the peace . " From the Commu nist point of view the war against Germany was only an episode in the war against capitalism , and " winning the peace " with the rest of the world was an objective as important as winning'I the actual battle against Germany . Stalin can hardly have failed ' to appreciate that atomic weapons , even if never used , would play a decisive part in the years immediately following the war . There was never any simple question of the U.S.S.R. needing the " secrets " of the atomic bomb to win the war against Germany or Japan , as the " traitors " suggested . Given every piece of information as it became available to Allied research work ers , the Soviet Union could not have built atomic weapons before the war ended . The object of the intense military espionage , organized by the U.S.S.R. on her allies was to strengthen her position in the years immediately after the defeat of Germany : and Japan , both by constructing atomic weapons and by being. : able to gauge the defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S.S.R. for their part considered there was no purpose in giving the U.S.S.R. information which she could not use during the war but which , if it had " leaked " to Ger many or Japan , would have put the " Great Alliance " in morta danger . The U.S.S.R. did not declare war on Japan until : August 8 , 1945 , a few days before the end , and Japanese diplo  | mats and spies remained in the Soviet Union throughout the war with Germany . The targets of the Soviet secret service are based on the Communist doctrine that all capitalist countries are " enemies " ? whether or not , at the moment , there is an alliance with one or more of them for a particular purpose . To the Soviet Union the Western Powers remained " enemies " in that sense even during the wartime alliance with Britain and the U.S.A. , and the tasks assigned to the Soviet secret service were , therefore , by no means limited to atomic research and production . The documents handed over by Gouzenko show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the atomic bomb , but also in the " how many . " The purpose was not simply to steal technical secrets to save research , although this was a welcome by-product of espionage , but to get knowledge of the probable quantity of production , which would be a measure of Western strength after the defeat of Germany . Thus a Moscow cable ten weeks after the surrender of Germany ordered Zabotin : " Try to get from him i.e. , Nunn May before departure detailed information on the progress of the work on uranium .... " And ten days later Zabotin was able to cable , " To the Directors ; Facts given by Alek , " which included the rate of production of U.235 at the magnetic separation plant at Clinton ( 400 grams daily ) . From this the Soviet scientists probably had no difficulty in estimating the number of atomic bombs that could be produced . Russia was already in possession of the " secrets " of the atomic bomb , thanks to the cooperation of Fuchs , Greenglass , and the Rosenbergs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken of the fact that Moscow was seeking to assess the potential production . On what date the Soviet secret service learned of the Western atomic program it is impossible to state exactly . It was not later than 1943 . One of the charges to which Fuchs pleaded guilty was " giving information in 1943 in the City of Birmingham , " so that certainly in that year the Soviet secret service knew what the world , including Germany , did not learn until August , 1945 ? that Britain had decided on an ambitious program of  | atomic research . The date was probably earlier . In January , 1943 , the Soviet Purchasing Commission in the U.S.A. made requests to the Lend-Lease Administration for shipments of uranium and uranium compounds . Uranium had long been used in color ceramics , photography , and as an analytical agent , but the large amounts asked for by the U.S.S.R. at that time , with requests for heavy water , might well have aroused suspicion . The U. S. Joint Committee on Atomic Energy which after the war went very fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were two shipments to the U.S.S.R. of 1420 pounds of uranium salts and one shipment of 2.2 pounds of uranium metal , together with too grams of heavy water . All this was quite legal , with the consent of all the necessary agencies . The official view seems to have been that suddenly to have forbidden all such shipments would have aroused Russian interest and been more dangerous to security than to supply the materials . In fact some of the requests of the Soviet Purchasing Committee were refused , the excuse of " unavailability " being given . The records show that in April , 1943 , the Soviet Purchas ing Committee protested about these refusals when they dis covered that the materials existed in the U.S.A. The uranium products could be used as the Russians suggested for alloys , and ; ; it is pointless to indulge in hindsight , but reading the reports ; and documents when they became available seven years later , we may wonder whether there was not complacency on the part of the authorities in their firm belief that the atomic program was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was formed by the Soviet government , and Soviet scientists with the necessary specialist qualifications were harnessed to the task of framing technical questions to be answered by Soviet agents in Britain and America , and of assessing the significance of the information received from them . The scientific team included Professors Kapitza , Alekhanov , I lyin , Kurchaev , and Academician Lebedev . The Cheka and Beria were preoccupied with wartime intelligence work , directing a large number of centers in Germany , Japan , and the neu- tral countries . The over-all control of the atomic espionage was given to Andrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov who , since Kirov 's mysterious death in 1934 , had become Stalin 's closest friend and confidant . Zhdanov had studied natural science and , as Colonel General of the Red Army and member of the Supreme Military Soviet in the war , was fully aware of the strategic implications of atomic weapons . Undoubtedly , Beria was envious of Zhdanov , both because of Stalin 's friendship for him and because he was given this atomic assignment . The sudden death of Zhdanov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52 from the heart failure ? which had become an occupational disease of the Kremlin ? has never been fully explained but was the key to Malenkov 's rise . For his successes in directing atomic espionage Stalin gave Zhdanov every possible honor , including the Suvorov Order First Class , Kutouzov Order First Class , and the Order of the Red Banner . There is a significant paragraph in the part of his obituary in Pravda , written by Professor Vavilov , then President of the Academy of Science . " Our scientists and our scientific institutions received from Comrade Zhdanov instructions , advice , and most thorough comments on all major questions of principle pertaining to the essence and the organization of science in the service of the defense of our motherland .... " 1 Espionage for the Atomic Division was arranged through existing networks which were extended for the purpose . Although it was espionage concerned with " atomic secrets " which attracted all the headlines after the exposure of the Canadian spy ring , in fact the Soviet secret service devoted most of its resources in North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The efforts to secure agents in government , army , navy , and air force organizations , who could know nothing about the atomic bomb , were as great as the efforts to subvert scientists in the laboratories . The Atomic Division cooperated with agents of all the Soviet intelligence departments 1 . Pravda , September 1 , 1948.  | ? those of the Cheka , the " Fourth Bureau " of the General Staff , and the Commissariats for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade . Even at a time when Nunn May ( " Alek " ) was supplying unique atomic information , he was being pressed about his knowledge of the proximity fuse about which he could have had no specialized knowledge or firsthand information . Telegram 242 , dated 7.9.45 from Zabotin ( " Grant " ) to Moscow , read : To the Director . On our task Alek has reported brief data concerning electronic shells . In particular these are being used by the American Navy against Japanese suicide flyers . There is in the shell a small radio transmitter with one electronic tube and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shell is the antenna . The bomb explodes in the proximity of an airplane from the action of the reflected waves from the airplane on the transmitter . The basic difficulties were : the preparation of a tube and batteries which could withstand the discharge of the shell and the determination of a rotation speed of the shell which would not require special adaptation in the preparation of the shell . The Americans have achieved this result , but apparently have not handed this over to the English . The Americans have used a plastic covering for the battery which withstands the force of pressure during the motion of the shell ? Grant . Many other documents from the Soviet Embassy in Canada illustrate this point that the Soviet secret service 's interest was not wholly or even primarily in atomic weapons . For instance a report on a meeting of Lunan 's group stated , " Badeau asks for permission to change to work on uranium . . . " but on this Motinov , Zabotin 's assistant , decided " not to recommend the transfer of Badeau to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in research . " It is clear that atomic espionage had not been given absolute priority . In the United States Rosenberg had himself successfully brought a vital electronic device out of a factory in his luncheon box and handed it to his Soviet secret service contact . Morton Sobell , tried with  | the Rosenbergs and given a long sentence , was not concerned with atomic weapons but with the proximity fuse and radar . When the development of the atomic weapon was moved across the Atlantic , Moscow began to make important changes in the local direction of the spy rings in North America . In Canada and the United States the Soviet secret service had operated continuously for nearly 20 years . In the United States Jacob Golos , among a number of agents , had been particularly active and successful for at least a decade . In Canada the Royal Commission found that " two of the most active persons in this organization were Fred Rose , born in Lublin , Poland , and Sam Can , born Kogan or Cohen in Tomachpol , Ukraine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian organization was put on a " war footing " in 1942 when Major Sokolov was sent from Moscow . He was directed by " Molier , " identified as Mikhailov of the Soviet Consulate in New York , visiting Canada ostensibly in connection with the Canadian Mutual Aid Program to the U.S.S.R. As director of military espionage Moscow sent Sergei N. Koudrivtzev in the guise of first secretary of the legation , later to become an embassy . Sokolov took his orders from him until in June , 1943 , Moscow sent Colonel Zabotin to expand the organization , obviously with the knowledge that Canada was to play an important part in the atomic program . In his black , silver-trimmed uniform , Zabotin cut a dash at diplomatic gatherings and was well known for his vodka and caviar parties and ability to hold his liquor . These diplomatic gatherings served the double purpose of acting as " cover " and offering opportunities for making new contacts . But his most effective work was done through the old hands , Fred Rose , the Canadian Communist ( " Labor Progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lunan , editor of the military journal Canadian Affairs . Although not himself a scientist , Lunan was well placed to recruit or recommend experts . Through Lunan , Zabotin 's assistant Rogov arranged a cell of scientists and thus the network was quickly expanded . Zabotin 's notebook showed that through Rose he " inherited " Professor Raymond Boyer of McGill University , an authority on explosives , who actually  | devised a new way of manufacturing the explosive RDX . Zabotin 's note on Boyer read : Fred 's work Professor Group in Montreal ( activists ) Frenchman . Noted chemist , about 40 years of age . Works in McGill University , Montreal . Is the best of the specialists on VV on the American continent . Gives full information on explosives and chemical plants . Very rich . He is afraid to work . ( Gave the formula of RDX . ) Later on " the Professor " supplied atomic information as reported in a telegram from Zabotin to Moscow : To the Director . The Professor reported that the Director of the National Chemical Research Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction ; Pilot Plant at Grand Mere in Province of Quebec .

As a result of experiments carried out with uranium , it has been found that uranium may be used for filling bombs , which in fact is already being done . The Americans have developed wide research work , having invested in this business 66o million dollars ? Grant . In fact , the Professor 's information was inaccurate ? the plant was at Chalk River , not Grand Mere . Allan Nunn May was not part of the Canadian network but was contacted by Zabotin 's Lieutenant Angelov on orders from Moscow . The Royal Commission reported that Nunn May " had been contacted not long after his arrival in Canada . " The documents suggest that although Nunn May went to Canada in 1943 , he was not used until early in 1945 . Even at this time , thanks to successes in the U.S.A. , the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the construction of the bomb . Lieutenant Angelov revealed this indirectly by the technical questions he asked Nunn May . " He made specific requests  | for information which were just nonsense to me ? I mean by this that they were difficult for me to comprehend , " said Dr. Nunn May 's statement . In other words , the Soviet scientists at this time knew more than one of the leading British physicists engaged in the program ! The position was remedied , no doubt on the suggestion of Angelov , by Dr. Nunn May going on visits to one of the U.S. centers where the most secret work was in progress . The networks in the United States yielded richer results not because the agents there were more efficient or the traitors more willing , but because more information was available and because the New York organization had been given at least one informer and found another actually working in the place where the bomb was taking shape . One was Klaus Fuchs , who knew a great deal and was enthusiastic to pass it on . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Alamos , no enthusiast and not very clever , but keen to earn money and easily developed . In theory and organization the Canadian and United States atomic espionage efforts were separate , but investigations since the war have shown tenuous connections which , if they had been followed , would have produced a trail leading from one network to the other . Just as in Canada there were networks , not connected with that of Zabotin , never exposed and which may have been concerned with atomic information , so in the United States the network directed by Yakovlev which included Gold , Rosenberg , Greenglass , and Fuchs was certainly not the only one . The men and women detected and tried were not the only ones in contact with Yakovlev . He may have worked with other couriers besides Gold , who naturally knew nothing of them . A great number of allegations have been made in the U.S.A. and very few charges proved in a court of law , hut among the statements contained in the Report on Soviet Espionage Activities in Connection with the Atom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Representatives in 1948 was one that during the war a certain Arthur Alexan- drovich Adams was " discovered to be actively engaged in espionage activities for the Soviet government . " Those activities included securing information " with respect to the develments that were being made in the United States in connection with nuclear fission . " The brief facts about Adams are that , an old revolutionary , he was " virtually a charter member Communist of the Soviet Union , " had entered the United States at intervals from 1920 onward in various capacities ostensibly connected with Soviet trade affairs , and that when government agents secretly searched his room in 1944 , " he was found to have in his possession highly secret information regarding the atomic bomb plant at Oak Ridge as well as other vital information regarding the development of atomic energy in other countries . " Early in 1945 Adams found he was being shadowed and attempted to escape in a Soviet ship at Portland , Oregon , but was " thwarted by the FBI . " For reasons not explained he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disappeared . " According to the committee 's best information he is now in the Soviet Union . " The point of interest about Adams is that on October 25 , 1944 , he was seen to enter a car registered in the name of Pavel Mikhailov , Soviet vice-consul in New York , and was driven to the Soviet consulate . Mikhailov , as we have seen , was the man who visited Canada to form the spy ring eventually directed by Zabotin . The Soviet secret service must count itself lucky that the intelligence authorities in the U.S.A. did not inform those in Canada that this man Mikhailov , who had visited them in connection with the Mutual Aid program , had been in close touch with a Soviet secret agent who had access to atomic secrets ! Another link existed in the appearance of Fuchs ' name in one of the documents or diaries which eventually came into the hands of the Canadian authorities . But this was probably purely coincidental . Fuchs ' name was among those of some 70 British scientists , presumably all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research program and , all having been cleared for security , there was no reason in 1945 to suspect one   more than the others . The list was probably compiled for the Moscow Index , and the Canadian network did not know Fuchs was already working for the Soviet secret service . Yakovlev himself might have come under suspicion because of what can only be considered lack of imagination or an inexplicable regard for the truth on the part of the organization in Moscow which created his " biography . " As I have explained , when a secret agent is sent abroad in the guise of a diplomat or official representative , a fictional biography or legend is created for him to satisfy any inquiries that might come from the country to which he was to be accredited . In the case of Anatoli Yakovlev , on his appointment as Soviet vice-consul in New York , a " foreign official status notification " was required by the U. S. State Department . The Commissariat for Foreign Affairs notified the State Department that Yakovlev was born in 1911 in Borisoglebsk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " Student , engineering , Economic Institute , Moscow , from 1936 to 1941 , present occupation , clerk . " It was fortunate for the Soviet secret service that those whose business it was to examine this notification document in the U.S.A. did not show any curiosity about why a man who at the age of 25 took up engineering studies and was a student for the unusually long period of five years , should on the completion of his technical studies immediately sail for America to work as a " clerk " in the Soviet diplomatic service . A little more curiosity on the part of the State Department might have led to Yakovlev being watched , when his strange ways of making appointments with Americans would have been observed and his friendship with Gold , already known to have been connected with Golos , discovered . Gold had been brought to Yakovlev after the death of Golos in 1943 through Semen M. Semenov , an official of the Soviet Amtorg Trading Corporation . The Soviet secret service had its share of luck in this and other directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S.A. were completely ignorant of each other 's activities . Early in 1945 the Soviet secret service had provided a clear picture of atomic development . In the U.S.A. Yakovlev 's net- work which used Harry Gold as its courier had sent technical calculations and data supplied by Fuchs and diagrams of the explosive mold for the atomic bomb supplied by Greenglass , together with a 12-page report typed by Ethel Rosenberg based on her husband Julius Rosenberg 's interrogation of Greenglass . In Canada Lunan had passed on the information from Durnford Smith in March , 1945 , that the " most secret work is on nuclear physics ( bombardment of radioactive substances to produce energy ) " , which was more hush-hush than radar , and Moscow had come back with the demand for a sample of " uran . No. 235 , " which had been supplied . Moscow , in fact , knew then a good deal more about the atomic bomb than the great majority of those directing the war in the West . And it had good reason to believe it would learn all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atomic spy nets in North America was not so much their success in obtaining information as their skill ? and luck ? in failing to arouse the slightest suspicion among those charged with guarding the greatest technical secret of the war . This was due to various circumstances . Although atomic research and production were the West 's most closely guarded secrets , they were guarded from the Germans and Japanese , rather than from the Russians . The security organizations were completely successful in preventing any leakage of information to Germany , but they do not appear to have considered sufficiently the possibility that the most determined attack would be made by the secret service of an ally . The warning that the Soviet Union was not content with information through official channels implicit in the detection and conviction of a number of minor Soviet spies " caught in the act " in Britain and the U.S.A. , after the entry of the U.S.S.R. into the war , was not sufficiently heeded . The Allies opened generous channels of information to the Russians and the fact that they made so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions , should have aroused suspicion . It might have struck them as odd that not even the most generalized questions were asked   about the possibilities of atomic explosives , or even the nature of " Tube Alloys " and the " Manhattan District Project . " Although the systematic subversion of nationals had been the most powerful weapon of Soviet espionage for decades , the possibility that important men who had taken oaths of secrecy would deliberately betray their country to Russia in the middle of a war does not seem to have been seriously considered in the West . Some of the leading atomic scientists were " guarded " wherever they went for their own safety , but the Soviet agents ' success in meeting Nunn May and Fuchs , the willing informers , was made easier by the fact that the vast majority of scientists were completely loyal and " security-minded " and impatient of restraining physical security measures . The Soviet secret service was also helped by various other factors . Fighting a common enemy , Germany , together with Britain and the U.S.A. , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also the fullest cooperation in secret and efficient communications between America and the Soviet Union . Soviet couriers were going to and from one continent to the other protected by the Allied intelligence organizations . Moscow could increase rapidly the number of its diplomatic , commercial , and military representatives in the capitals of the West under the pretext of consultations . Finally , outrages committed by Hitler 's armies in occupied Russia and the bravery of the Red Army generated much good will for the Russian people in the West , and the British and U. S. governments were ready to do almost anything to avoid upsetting the Kremlin . The lessons of the past were forgotten , or at least it was thought the leopard had changed his spots . In Britain the discoveries of Soviet spies ? and their subsequent trials ? were not publicized , and in the United States the FBI have later suggested they were restrained from bringing home charges against suspected Soviet agents . By the time the statesmen of the victorious nations assembled at Potsdam to settle the peace , the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and something about the anticipated rate of production of the atom bomb . Soviet  | scientists had , at this date , probably actually begun work . Sir Winston Churchill suggests in his account of the Potsdam meeting that Stalin was at that time ignorant of the existence of the A-bomb ? news of the success of the last tests reached President Truman on July 16 while the conference was in progress . But an examination of the evidence at the Canadian , United States , and British atomic spy trials indicates that the Soviet dictator knew a great deal about the bomb . His apparent indifference to President Truman 's hints at a super weapon was simulated to avoid arousing suspicions that might lead to realization of the extent of Soviet espionage . Moscow learned all about the bomb on Japan shortly after it was dropped on August 6 , 1945 . Zabotin telegraphed from Ottowa that " Alek " had stated it was made of uranium 235 and that the output of this substance now amounted to 400 grams daily at the magnetic-separation plant at Clinton , with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London where arrangements were made through Moscow for him to meet another Soviet agent , but Zabotin had " other clients , " as he put it , to keep his network in Canada supplied with atomic information . Western counterintelligence organizations still had no suspicion that the Soviet Embassy in Charlotte Street , Ottawa , was the center of a spy net , and might well have remained in ignorance indefinitely if Igor Gouzenko , the cipher clerk , had not decided he preferred freedom . On September 5 , 1945 , he put into practice a plan which he had long contemplated and for which he had made preparations by collecting a large number of documents revealing the most undiplomatic activities of a dozen of the leading Soviet diplomats in Ottawa , as well as many Canadian citizens who had been suborned by them . He had learned something from his work in the Soviet secret service . To avoid suspicion , he had simply turned down the edges of the documents he had selected , leaving them in the files , so that he could pick them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment had come . With enough evidence in his pocket to put a dozen spies in jail he walked out of the embassy and went to a newspaper office . The  | editor refused to take him seriously . When next day he made a number of calls on government officials and again on the newspaper , he was still not taken seriously . The truth might never have been revealed if the embassy , alarmed at the absence of its cipher clerk , had not characteristically used " strong-arm methods " to try and get him back . In 1945 a man might have walked around one of the democracies offering documents which showed it was riddled with Soviet spies and be greeted with raised eyebrows and skeptical smiles . But the moment the door of his flat was broken down by strangers and his cupboards ransacked , the police took notice . Gouzenko was taken into protective custody , told his story , and this time was listened to , apparently with a mixture of embarrassment and incredulity that did not disappear until the interpretation of his documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Canada . These events were not , at the time , fully known to the public , who had only confused accounts of what had happened , and six months passed before the full impact of them hit the headlines of the free world 's press . Although the Soviet Embassy asked for the " surrender " of Gouzenko on a " capital charge " and claimed he was a thief , the Soviet secret service does not seem to have been unduly alarmed . Zabotin had no idea of the number of documents Gouzenko had taken because many of these documents were shown in the official records as having been burned . At the time Zabotin does not seem to have informed his Moscow headquarters fully of the catastrophe , for he remained in Ottawa , and plans to increase the number of Soviet agents under the guise of diplomatic or commercial staff continued to be pressed . But as a precaution Moscow canceled the appointment for Dr. Nunn May in front of the British Museum for October 7 , and " our man in London " did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and December , to the disappointment of Scotland Yard 's Special Branch . Dr. Nunn May himself did not keep the appointment because , he stated , " I had decided that this clandestine procedure was no longer ap- propriate in view of the official release of information and the possibility of satisfactory international control of atomic energy . " His view may have been influenced by reading in the newspapers that a clerk had " deserted " from the Ottawa embassy . All the persons concerned in the Gouzenko documents were described only by their " cover names . " The task of identifying them and making sense of the documents was difficult . Knowledge of the difficulties may have led Zabotin and Moscow to think it was impossible . At any rate Moscow was in no hurry to take the obvious step of withdrawing the 15 members of the embassy staff engaged in espionage . The headquarters was presumably ready to " write off " Zabotin 's network , knowing that it had several other networks in Canada . The danger that a clue to the network in Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London " was avoided ? whether he was the same man used later to act as courier for Fuchs we can not know . From Moscow 's point of view the most serious consequence when the case burst into the headlines may have seemed that the exposure of the cynical technique of subversion and espionage would alert the public and result in countermeasures making it difficult for them to be used again . But if these fears existed in Moscow they must have been dispersed by the official reaction to the disclosures and the Nunn May trial . Whatever counterintelligence organizations learned from it ? and they did not learn enough to catch Fuchs for another four years ? the politicians and the public regarded it as unpleasant , exceptional , and something to be forgotten . The statesmen of the West were not anxious to spoil what they hoped would be the harmonious discussions at the conference of Foreign Ministers in December of 1945 . At the trial of Dr. Nunn May the greatest care was taken to avoid the mention of the Soviet secret service as the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attorney general said , " There is no kind of suggestion that the Russians are enemies or potential enemies . . . . " And again : " I should like to know why Russia has been intro- duced ( by the defense ) . I made no reference to Russia or America ... . It is characteristic of the atmosphere that in spite of pressure in the House of Commons the British government refused to publish in Britain the 750-page report of the Royal Commission in Canada or , what would have been more valuable , a full summary of it which would have been virtually a guide to the Soviet secret service 's methods of subversion and espionage . It is also characteristic that the Royal Commission 's report itself , while concealing nothing , gave the impression of men astonished at what they had learned ? that Soviet diplomats could be engaged in espionage , that members of a democratic parliament and officials who had taken special oaths could put their loyalty to the Soviet Union above their loyalty to their country and colleagues . " Essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was first developed in less fortunate countries to promote an underground struggle against tyranny , to a democratic society where it is singularly inappropriate , " the Royal Commission concluded , as if it had made a discovery . The " transplanting " had been going on for more than two decades ! Morally the exposure did not hurt the Soviet secret service badly . Moscow passed it off with a final note which admitted that in their enthusiasm some members of the military attache 's staff might have done things that were " inadmissible . " But the note was largely an attack on Canada for making " propaganda for sinister motives . " In spite of its final failure , the Canadian spy ring had earned rich dividends , providing not merely atomic information which tied in with that obtained from the U.S.A. and Britain , but also on many other armaments . On Asdic , for instance , Moscow obtained " much and very possibly all of the information available in Canada . " The Canadian Prime Minister , as soon as he became aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truman at the White House . Perhaps because of what he had learned he said , " Information of this kind can not be easily trusted to telegraphic communication . " The close liaison of J. Edgar Hoover ,  | chief of the FBI , with the Canadian investigations was arranged . But so effectively had the Canadian and New York networks been divided that the FBI obtained no fresh clues to the U. S. spy nets . In fact , Fuchs had his last meeting with Gold in the U.S.A. just a fortnight after Gouzenko deserted . That the meeting was not canceled on orders from Moscow suggests there was confidence no clue in Canada could point to the U.S.A. At this meeting arrangements were made for Fuchs to be contacted in London . Fuchs ' confession has never been published in full , but from other sources at my disposal it seems the appointment was for the first Saturday of every month at 8 P.M. at an underground station , the physical identification ? five books bound with string under one arm and two books under the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further appointments at an average of twomonthly intervals . The arrest of Nunn May does not appear to have led the Soviet secret service to call off the meetings , although in accordance with practice , they may have been postponed for a period to see if any suspicion had been aroused . In the United States the effect of the Canadian disclosures was an immediate increase in activity by counterintelligence and tightening of security . Even if this did not result in any arrests it made Yakovlev , in charge of atomic espionage in New York , extremely apprehensive . At the end of 1945 Moscow arranged for Yakovlev to meet " a very important person " ? never publicly identified ? visiting from Europe . The visitor was so effectively shadowed by counterintelligence agents that Yakovlev had to give up the idea of a meeting . At a meeting with Gold in January , 1946 , Yakovlev was nervous and he did not turn up at all to the meeting arranged for February . Gold 's activities necessarily ceased , and it seems probable that Yakovlev also was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December , 1946 , that Yakovlev , taking extreme precautions to insure secrecy , met Gold again and spoke of a trip to Paris , handing him orders on onionskin paper . Moscow may have decided there was now more to be learned in Europe than in the U.S.A. At this meeting Gold disclosed he was working for  | Brothman , and Yakovlev , knowing Brothman earlier had attracted the attention of the FBI , quickly returned to Russia and Gold never went to Europe . In 1947 came the disclosure by Elizabeth Bentley of the extensive activities of Jacob Golos , who had died in 1943 . The FBI knew all about Golos but had not been able to do more than pin a technical charge on him in 1940 , which resulted in a fine . Now they interviewed Gold , who they knew had been associated with Golos , but failed to get any admission . Moscow knew therefore that Fuchs was still safe . Golos had also worked with the Rosenbergs but the FBI had no pointer to them . The failure to secure Golos was extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key to many spies in the U.S.A. After Greenglass left Los Alamos at the end of the war , Rosenberg got no more information from him , but he seems to have developed other contacts . At any rate he told Greenglass he had informers in many places , and stated one of them was giving him data about the use of atomic energy for driving aircraft and the plans of the proposed " sky-platform project " or artificial satellite . Rosenberg was passing information by microfilms secreted in an alcove of a cinema , and having occasional meetings at lonely spots . These boasts of Rosenberg may or may not have been true . There is little evidence that the Soviet secret service obtained much information in the U.S.A. after 1945 . U. S. security became tighter so that even British scientists when they visited the U.S.A. for " declassification " discussions were never let out of the sight of security officers when in atomic establishments . The detection of Fuchs when it came and , it is believed , the end of this phase of atomic espionage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of their experts at a meeting of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission used words which showed he had access to what were considered absolutely safe secrets of U. S. atomic research , secrets to which Nunn May could not have had access . This pointed to the existence of an undetected agent " X " who must have worked in a particular field in the U.S.A. One by one the possibilities were eliminated and  | finally the FBI were able to ask the British counterintelligence if they were satisfied about Fuchs . The rest of the story is well known . The Soviet secret service lost its most valuable informer , but not until he had served them well for seven years . But even with the arrest of Fuchs , the Soviet secret service was confident the network would not be unmasked because of the system of communications used between members . One immediate result of the conviction of Fuchs was a visit to his prison cell , with his consent , of Hugh Clegg and Robert Lamphere of the FBI . They were anxious to identify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S.A. But Fuchs did not know Harry Gold 's real name . Gold called himself Raymond to Fuchs and John to Greenglass . Nor , after the lapse of years , was his description accurate , and Fuchs failed to identify anyone in the numerous photographs shown him . The FBI narrowed down the search from 1500 possible suspects to Gold , and brought the charge home as a result of just one error on the part of Gold ? he had failed to destroy a guide to Santa Fe where he had met Fuchs . Only after Gold 's arrest and confession did Fuchs identify him from a motion picture flown over and shown to him . Gold 's confession led to Greenglass , who in turn led to the two Rosenbergs . Ethel and Julius Rosenberg , in spite of many opportunities , never confessed , and the trail ended there ? it is probable they were in touch with many other agents . What has , so far , proved the last episode in the drama of Soviet atomic espionage occurred when Professor Bruno Pontecorvo made his hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken an important part in atomic research , according to some experts a more important part than Fuchs , but whether the Soviet secret service had been in touch with him continuously since his early left-wing days has never been disclosed . He worked for the National Research Council in Montreal from ' 1943 onward and in 1945 was transferred to the Chalk River plant for highly secret work . After the war he took a position with the British Atomic Energy organization , but remained in Canada until 1949 , when he was transferred to Harwell and  | later took a professorship at Liverpool University on the eve of his disappearance . If during any of the seven years when he worked on secret projects , Pontecorvo was contacted by the Soviet secret service , they left no clue . There was no reference to him in the Gouzenko papers , unless he was one of the unidentified code names , which has never been suggested . The facts about his disappearance fit better in the theory that he was " blackmailed " into going to Russia at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an atomic scientist with his particular specialization . His zapiski in the Moscow Index would have shown his family and other connections with his prewar leftward inclination , which if known in the West would probably have resulted in his access to secret information being restricted . The trial and sentence of 14 years on Fuchs would have been sufficient to bring home the threat of exposure and ruin . None of the evidence of his last flight with his family suggests kidnaping in the ordinary sense , but the Soviet secret service knows the possibilities of making the victim go without using physical force . In a single chapter it has been possible to touch on only a few aspects of atomic espionage which certainly continues . As far as the Soviet secret service was concerned , it was simply one target among many , if a very important one . The campaign had great success because the efficiency , extent , and techniques of the Soviet secret service all seem to have been underestimated . The popular reaction to the revelations , when they came , of what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been betrayed by friends . This must undoubtedly have struck the Soviet secret service as almost incredibly naive . If in later years Moscow , as a result of the exposure of two atomic spy rings , found the task of getting information about research and production of atomic weapons increasingly difficult , the Soviet rulers were compensated by the dissension resulting between Britain and the U.S.A. over security and the fear and suspicion aroused in America .  | Many millions of ordinary men and women reading the account given to the Australian Royal Commission by Mrs. Evdokia Petrov of her actions and feelings during the days after her husband 's defection in April , 1954 , must have wondered whether she was not exaggerating . In a dramatic statement , the woman who had herself been a Cheka agent for 16 years , said , " When my husband disappeared , I thought he had been kidnaped . But even when I learned that he had reached safety and been afforded protection by the Australian government , I could do nothing to join him . " She told how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was allowed to speak to her . She saw preparations being made for her departure to Russia and felt it useless to resist , because she would have been " murdered then and there in the embassy building . " Many spectators on the airfield and numerous photographs bear witness to her " manhandling " by armed Soviet bodyguards . But kidnaping and murder in an embassy ? Would Soviet officials really dare to liquidate anyone in the heart of the capital of a free country ? How would they dispose of the body ? What would be the reaction of the world to such a crime ? Was  | it not just a question of Mrs. Petrov 's imagination getting the better of her ? Whatever temptation there may have been for Petrov and his wife to exaggerate in order to make an impression on their new-found friends , their statements that they lived in fear of being murdered can be accepted without reservation . The history of the Cheka 's " executive branch " contains scores of cases of men and women being kidnaped and murdered in full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and these crimes have been committed with the active help of Soviet Embassy officials . Petrov , like Gouzenko , knew that men who had turned their backs on Moscow had been murdered under the very eyes of the police in the streets of Paris , in the shadow of the Swiss Alps , in a Washington hotel room , and on New York 's Fifth Avenue . When , on April 23 , 1954 , the American authorities in Germany announced that three Soviet secret service agents had surrendered to them and that their leader , captain of the MVD , Nicolai Evgenyevich Khokhlov had confessed their mission was to assassinate Georgi Okolovich , the chairman of the Russian anti-Communist N.T.S. organization in Frankfurt , there was indignant horror in the free world . But this disclosure of the activities of the Cheka 's Otdyel for Terror and Diversion should have come as no surprise . Scores of similar assignments had been carried out with complete success by Moscow 's " traveling executioners " over a period of years . Only the short memory of people in the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Khokhlov affair " caused in the spring of 1954 . The novelty of this case was that Khokhlov brought with him into freedom the strange weapons with which he had been equipped for his job : a case which shot poisoned dum-dum bullets through the tips of cigarettes and an electrically fired miniature revolver , four inches long and three-and-a-half inches high , that could be hidden in the palm of the hand , which made no more noise than a snap of the fingers . It was said that if a popular writer of thrillers had invented a tale of disguised secret agents carrying such weapons to kill  | their victim in the center of a busy European city , even ardent readers would say the story was incredible . But , in fact , these things have been done , and done successfully , by Cheka agents before . The Khokhlov case , for all its fantastic features was , seen in proportion , only the latest and a minor incident in a long catalogue of kidnapings and murders by shooting , stabbing , poisoning , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret agents and members of the Mobile Groups . The liquidation of political enemies is not a Communist invention . It is as old as the story of politics . But the Russians have specialized in it for centuries and the Communists in the last 40 years have simply adopted more subtle methods than the bombs thrown at passing royal carriages by the nihilists and revolutionaries . We have accepted the recurrent purges , mass executions , shootings without trial , and deportations to slavelabor camps within the frontiers of the Soviet Union and her , satellites as part and parcel of the Communist judicial system . What we find hard to believe is that the Otdyel for Terror and Diversion systematically uses these methods in the outside world . Before examining in detail a few characteristic cases from the long catalogue of kidnapings and murders to illustrate the methods of the Cheka outside Russia , we should look at the personalities of the Special Division of the Second Directorate which at the moment is presided over by Alexander Panyushkin , who as a Soviet diplomat used to be a guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Western democracies . In 1942 the chief of the division was Lieutenant Colonel ( later Major General ) Pavel Nikoforovich Sudoplatov . One of his efforts was the attempt on Herr Franz von Papen , the German ambassador in Ankara . In one of my books on wartime espionage 1 I described in detail how this plan had been prepared by the Cheka . On the morning of March 14 , 1942 , von  | Papen was strolling along the Boulevard Attaturk in the Turkish capital when a bomb exploded a few yards in front of him . The assassin , a young Kurd , was instantly killed ; von Papen remained unhurt . The Turkish police arrested two Russians who had arrived a few weeks earlier by air from Baku . They passed under the names of Georgi Pavlov and Leonid Kornilov , but the Turkish court which tried them did not insist on uncovering their real identities , or probe the name of their employer , who was Colonel Sudoplatov . They were sentenced to 16 years ' penal servitude , but three years later , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war against Germany at the last moment , they were quietly released and sent home to Russia . Perhaps rather extravagantly , Khokhlov claimed that Sudoplatov had given him the assignment to murder von Papen but that he had refused it . Sudoplatov was arrested with Beria in 1953 , and although his name has not appeared in the official announcement , he has probably been executed . After Sudoplatov 's arrest , Kruglov , the new Cheka boss , appointed Colonel Lev Irodovich Studnikov as head of the section . Colonel ( later Lieutenant General ) , Leonid Alexandrovich Eytington , who had been Sudoplatov 's deputy for several years , was 62 when he was shot after Beria 's downfall . He had considerable experience of liquidations abroad . His first big assignment was in 1930 , when he organized the kidnaping of the White Russian emigre General Kutyepov in Paris , which I will describe later . In 1936 he was sent to Spain , where he was in charge of the mass executions of anti-Stalinist Communists . His Spanish service earned him the rank of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Leon Trotsky . The present chief of the section , Studnikov , is a typical Cheka police cop , who had been in charge of some internal divisions before Kruglov promoted him to supervise murders in the international field . But Eytington was of Jewish origin , well educated and cultured , fluent in French and English , and well traveled in Europe . At the beginning of January , 1951 , he was in France ? according to Khokhlov on an assignment to super- vise the liquidation of an emigre ? when he was denounced as intending to desert to the West . He was recalled home and imprisoned . But in appreciation of the great services he had rendered , Beria reprieved him , and in April , 1953 , Eytington , who was in poor health , recuperated in a sanatorium in Sochi in the Caucasus . When Beria was arrested , Eytington too was seized . He was succeeded by Evgenyi Ivanovich Mirkovsky , then chief of the Albanian Security Police in Tirana , nominally a department of the Albanian People 's Republic , actually controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief of the Otdyel for Terror and Diversion on January to , 1954 , with the rank of a colonel , though still a young man of about 35 . The headquarters of the Otdyel is in the Lubianka building , the original home of the Cheka before most of its departments were moved to the huge Comintern palace in the Machovaya Ulitza . The special agents are trained in a building in the Turnaninsky Pereulok , where Colonel Arkady Fotoyev is in charge . The section has two permanent branches abroad . One is in Karlshorst in the Soviet zone of Berlin , the other in the former imperial summer villa in Baden , near Vienna . The Berlin center deals with the Cheka terrorists whose assignments cover Germany , Western Europe , and Scandinavia , and serves as a transfer point for agents assigned to tasks in the United States and the Western hemisphere . The center at Baden is used by agents on their way to Southeast Europe , Yugoslavia , Greece , Turkey , Italy , and North Africa . The detailed preparation , final training , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the three men assigned for the liquidation of Georgi Okolovich in Frankfurt , as revealed by Khokhlov . Mr. Okolovich attracted particular hatred in Moscow because of the successful anti-Soviet propaganda of his organization , the N.T.S. ( Society of National tJnity ) , among Red Army men and officials in Eastern Germany and Austria . Millions of leaflets and pamphlets printed by the organization had been smuggled into the barracks of the Soviet soldiers . The N.T.S. claimed that their propaganda also   reached the Soviet Union itself and the satellite states . Indeed , Khokhlov 's eventual defection may have been inspired by it . In October , 1953 , Khokhlov was summoned by Colonel Studnikov and told to hold himself ready to go to Germany to carry out a liquidation . Early in November Khokhlov flew to East Berlin and reported to the Karlshorst center . He was introduced to two German Communists , Hans Kukowitsch and Kurt Weber , engaged in minor work for the Soviet secret service in Germany . On November to , Khokhlov and his two assistants flew to Moscow , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave , which he spent with his wife and his 21-months-old son . It was then that he told his wife of his assignment and was persuaded not to carry out the murder . But he had to report back , because he would otherwise have been arrested and probably shot . In the meantime Kukowitsch and Weber were at the special school for members of the Section No. 9 in Kuchino near Moscow , being instructed in the use of pistols , judo , and car-driving . Khokhlov was summoned several times to Kuchino to examine with his assistants maps of Frankfurt and photographs of the building where the White Russian organization had its offices as well as of Georgi Okolovich , its president . Some of this instruction was given by one of the few female high officials , Major Tamara Nicolayeva Ivanova , an expert on topography , whom Khokhlov described as an " overworked nervous spinster . " On December 29 , Khokhlov and his two companions flew back to Berlin . On his last visit Khokhlov was told by his chief , Colonel Studnikov , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps get a decoration . Studnikov added that the order authorizing Operation Rhine ( the code name for the murder of Okolovich ) had been given by General Kruglov , the Minister for State Security , himself . This was confirmed by Major General Panyushkin , head of the Second Directorate , to whom Khokhlov paid his respects before leaving Moscow . In Berlin the three men were ordered not to enter Western Germany from Berlin but to make a detour . Equipped with  | false identity papers , the two Germans went to Vienna and then to the center in Baden . Suddenly Khokhlov was ordered to return to Moscow , where he was told that the " operation " had been postponed because the Soviet government did not want an assassination to occur during the Four Power Conference between Molotov , Dulles , Eden , and Bidault , due to start soon in Berlin . On January 13 , Khokhlov was ordered to fly to Vienna . He kicked his heels until February 8 when , after the breakdown of the conference , Panyushkin sent a go-ahead signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Bela Okum , a Hungarian by birth . Khokhlov was ordered to travel by air to Zurich . Using false Austrian passports , his German assistants traveled by train via Innsbruck . They met Khokhlov at Zurich on February 13 , and he told them to go on to Frankfurt , following alone four days later . He had already made up his mind to betray the plan to the Western authorities , but having some doubt about his reception , he decided to take his intended victim into his confidence first . On February 19 he went to Mr. Okolovich 's flat , not to murder him as ordered , but to tell him his story . Okolovich at once informed the American security service at Frankfurt . Khokhlov was taken into protective custody and , acting under instructions from the Americans , told the two Germans to go to Augsburg as arranged in Moscow to pick up the assassination weapons from a courier from the Austrian Cheka center . Khokhlov was convinced that another Mobile Group had been sent to Frankfurt to shadow him , and begged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might be murdered even in their company . The decisive meeting with the U. S. officers was therefore arranged in the Frankfurt Opera House on February 2o , and some of the vital conversations took place in a lavatory and in a dressing room behind the stage . Finally Khokhlov arranged a meeting with the two Germans on Feb . ruary 25 , and persuaded them to give themselves up . This meeting was secretly watched by armed American security o  | cers . Later the same day they picked up the murder weapons in the cloakroom of the Frankfurt Central Railway Station , where the two Germans had deposited them . Operation Rhine was ended ? but not according to plan . The Soviet secret service had spent four months and at least ? 10,000 on this operation designed to liquidate Mr. Okolovich , a person not of first political importance . But the Cheka has spent much more on killing less important persons , sometimes merely to satisfy the whims of revenge by some of the Kremlin rulers . The murder by Cheka agents of Ignace Reiss in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend as much as $50,000 on eliminating a deserter from the Cheka . The Mexican authorities estimated the murder of Trotsky cost Moscow $600,000 . Kidnaping by Soviet agents is now so frequent that it hardly excites comment , but the first big case 25 years ago shook public opinion . On Sunday , January 26 , 1930 , General Kutyepov set out from his flat in the Rue Rousselet in Paris , for the Russian Orthodox Church , leaving his wife and his five-year-old son behind . He said he would be back for lunch . He never returned . All the police could discover was that a few hundred yards from the flat a bearded man , later identified from photographs as the general , had a dispute with two policemen . They bundled him into a car which quickly drove off . But a check by the Paris Surete showed that no policemen had made an arrest in that district on that Sunday , and it became clear the general had been kidnaped by two men in police uniforms who were not members of the Paris force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no trace was ever found of General Kutyepov . He had been the chairman of the Union of Russian Ex-Combatants , a violent anti-Communist emigre organization , founded by the exiled Grand Duke Nicolai . It had a membership of 6o,000 in France and groups in other countries in Western Europe and America . Kutyepov had received many threatening letters from Communists , and there was little difficulty in concluding that the " policemen " were  | Soviet agents . The case was soon forgotten , but seven years later it was recalled by a similar episode . In 1937 the chairman of the Union of Ex-Combatants was General Eugene Miller , former chief of staff of the Tsarist Fifth Army , who had commanded the White Army at Murmansk in 1918 . After the withdrawal of the British troops under General Ironside , General Miller went to England and later settled in Paris . At the time of his disappearance he was 70 , and left much of the administrative work of the Union to its honorary secretary , Lieutenant General Scoblin . Scoblin was among those who believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , and advocated friendship with Hitler . He was accused of being a Soviet agent , which he indignantly denied , and a " court of honor " of four former Tsarist generals cleared him of these accusations . Miller appeared to have complete confidence in Scoblin 's sincerity . On September 22 , 1937 , Scoblin asked Miller to meet two German secret emissaries , a Captain Strohmann and a Herr von Werner , who , Scoblin said , had important news from Goring . Miller left his home to meet Scoblin and the two Germans in a cafe in the Bois de Boulogne . He never returned . The police later traced his movements to Le Havre , where they found the Soviet cargo boat , Marya Ulyanova , had left on the evening of General Miller 's disappearance . Scoblin denied any knowledge of the appointment with the two Germans or that he had ever invited Miller to a rendezvous . At a meeting of the council of the Union of Russian Ex-Combatants he was once again accused of being a Soviet agent and of having arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting after a row ? and was never seen again . Some days later his wife , who was the well-known Paris cabaret diseuse Nadine Plevitskaya , was arrested and charged with being an accomplice of the kidnaping . She was tried and received one of the longest sentences ever given by a French court to a woman ? 2o years ' hard labor . Nadine died at Rennes prison in 1944 . If she knew the secret of the disappearances of General Miller and her husband , she never revealed it . During  | their investigations the French police became interested in a French shoolmaster , Marcel Cance , living at Le Havre . Cance was in touch with the master of the Soviet ship Marya Ulyanova on the night Miller was supposed to have been put aboard the Soviet vessel . Just before the outbreak of the war , Cance was unmasked as one of the heads of the Soviet espionage network in France . Of Scoblin we have only an unconfirmed report received by the French intelligence after the war that he had died in Russia where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These two cases are characteristic of kidnaping by Soviet agents in the earlier days of the activities of the Otdyel for Terror and Diversion . Since the war , particulary in Germany and Austria , there have been many hundreds of similar kidnapings . When I visited Berlin in January , 1954 , Herr Stumm , the police president of West Berlin , told me his records showed some 400 persons kidnaped by Soviet agents , with the help of German Communists , during 1953 alone . He said rewards of between 500 and woo marks were paid by Soviet agents from the Eastern zone to German men and women acting as decoys . The kidnaping , and probable murder , of the Berlin lawyer , Dr. Eric Linse , chairman of the German Committee of Free Jurists , in July , 1952 , had international repercussions and illustrates some of the methods of Soviet secret agents . Early on July 11 a man approached a taxi driver in West Berlin and asked to be driven to the Senefelder Place in the Soviet sector . Berlin taxi drivers do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tip of 20 marks ( about 35s. ) and the cabbie consented . On the way the passenger leaned forward and dropped a carton containing loo American cigarettes on the front seat next to the driver , who thought this was a special bonus and thanked him . When , a moment later , the taxi stopped at its destination , two Volkspolizei ( People 's police ) constables jumped on the taxi , shouting , " So you are one of the American racketeers who smuggle cigarettes into the Eastern zone ! " Driver and passenger were taken to a police station , where the driver was put in a  | cell . He was kept there for two days , but never saw his passenger again . When he was released he was told to go back to West Berlin , where he would find his taxi . This drama was staged to secure a West Berlin taxi , carrying . proper registration plates . Investigations after Dr. Linse 's disappearance showed that the taxi appeared next morning in the quiet Gerichtstrasse , a tree-lined residential street where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Number 12 to walk to the El-railway station a few blocks away , to travel to his chambers . On this morning when he had walked about 3o yards two men got out of the taxi . They followed Dr. Linse and suddenly one jumped on him while the other hit him heavily . The men bundled Linse into the taxi , which had followed them slowly , and it went off at high speed toward the Soviet sector . A woman who saw the scene from the opposite pave-ment screamed and people started in pursuit , including a young man on his bicycle , a van later joining in the chase . Five revolver shots were fired at the pursuers from the taxi and a handful of " tetrahedrons , " used during the war for puncturing tires of military vehicles , thrown out . The van was stopped and the runners and the cyclist were left behind . But a couple of hundred yards away they saw a group of East Berlin Volkspolizei apparently waiting for the taxi , for they immediately lifted the road barrier at which every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Berlin police . The taxi went straight through and disappeared . It was the last seen or heard of Dr. Linse and his kidnapers . The British and the American High Commissioners at once lodged protests with the chairman of the Soviet Control Commission , General Vassilyi Chuikov , who promised to make inquiries . When after some weeks nothing was heard from the Soviet authorities the Linse case was raised in the House of Commons . Mr. Eden made a formal protest to the Soviet governrnent and the U. S. High Commissioner in Germany , John J. McCloy , followed suit . But the only result was a polite note from General Chuikov to his British and American colleagues ?  | stating that the investigations had been " entirely negative " and that no trace of a taxi or its passengers had ever been found in the Soviet zone . He added that " he hoped that the British and American High Commissioners did not really think that the Soviet authorities were in any way involved in this unfortunate incident ... . Dr. Linse , with his colleague Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years , helped by the late burgomaster , Ernest Reuter , and had published a number of pamphlets disclosing the activities of Soviet spies . The immediate reason for his liquidation was apparently the publication by Dr. Linse of a document revealing the extent of the organization and armament of the East German Volkspolizei and their cooperation with the Cheka . The East German government , obviously on behalf of the Cheka , had offered rewards of io , 000 marks ( about ? goo ) for Linse and Friedenau . Kidnaping methods have been employed on many other occasions to exterminate Communist traitors , most of them Cheka agents , who deserted to the West . But there is a striking difference in the treatment of anti-Communists and renegades . In the case of anti-Communists like Miller and Linse the objective is disappearance without trace . In the case of renegades the istrebiteli , members of the Cheka Mobile Groups , have instructions to leave the bodies behind as a warning to others who might be tempted to turn their backs on Moscow . The strong-arm methods of Cheka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former Resident Director of the Soviet secret service . Early on September 5 , 1937 , shopkeepers taking down the shutters in the Boulevard de Chamblandes in Lausanne noticed a large car with registration plates of the Berne Canton , parked on the wrong side of the road . The car appeared to be empty , but when some of the shopkeepers went up to it they found a man slumped on the floor at the back . The man 's clothes were  | stained with blood and there was a large pool of blood inside the car . The police found the dead man had been murdered in the car . His body was riddled with submachine-gun bullets . Seven bullets were found in his chest and abdomen , five had entered his head . The murderer or murderers had apparently fired again and again , as if in an uncontrollable rage . There had been no attempt to disguise the identity of the victim . In his breast pocket was a passport of the Czechoslovak Republic , issued in the name of Hans Erhardt of Prague , 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Swiss notes , as well as a silver watch and other valuables , such as a silver cigarette case and a gold signet ring , had not been touched . Clenched in the man 's right fist were some strands of a woman 's gray hair , evidently torn from her head in a desperate struggle . The car was identified as one hired two days before at the Casino Garage on the Kirchenfeld bridge in Berne , by a woman who had given her name as Fraulein Renata Steiner . The garage proprietor had seen her driving licence , which showed she was a Swiss citizen , and she had paid 150 francs as a deposit . When Swiss newspapers published the story of the mysterious murder , giving a description of the dead man , they said nothing of Miss Steiner , for whom the police were searching . Within an hour of the Gazette de Lausanne being on sale , a woman called on the superintendent of the Lausanne Criminal Police . She said she was Madame Ignace Reiss and feared the murdered man was her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she saw her fears confirmed . The Swiss police had no records of Hans Erhardt . But Ignace Reiss was known to the police and intelligence authorities all over Europe as a Soviet agent . He had worked for the Soviet secret service in Germany , France , Vienna , Holland , and Scandinavia . Polish by birth , 40 years old at his death , he had been one of the Resident Directors of the Soviet spy network in France . For many years he had been a follower of the Soviet leaders who , like Zinoviev , Kamenev , Bukharin , Smirnov , and Rakov- sky , had opposed Stalin and were executed or imprisoned during the purges . After receiving a warning in July , 1937 , that if he did not obey a summons to Moscow he would " be treated as a traitor and punished accordingly , " Reiss wrote a letter to " The Secretary General of the Central Committee of the AllUnion Communist Party " ? to Stalin , although he did not mention his name to emphasize his contempt . This letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Zinitzin , who was formally the head of the Soviet Trade Delegation . In his book , Assassins at Large , 2 Hugo Dewar quotes passages from this letter , a copy of which Reiss had given to his wife . The former Cheka top agent wrote in his farewell message to Stalin : ... This letter which I am addressing to you today I should have written a long time ago , on the day when the Sixteen 8 were murdered in the cellars of the Lubianka at the command of the Father of the People . I kept silent then . I raised no voice of protest at the subsequent murders , and I thereby burdened my conscience with a grievous responsibility . My guilt is great but I shall try and make amends , to make up for it quickly and ease my conscience . . . . Up to now I followed you ? from now on , not a step farther ! Here our ways part ! He who keeps silent at this hour becomes an accomplice of Stalin and a traitor to the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the age of 20 I have battled for Socialism . . . . Behind me are 16 years of underground service ; that is no trifle ? but I still have enough strength left to begin all over again . For the salvation of Socialism requires a " new beginning .

History is a stern mistress and " the genial leader , father of the people , the sun of socialism " will have to answer for all his deeds . . . . I am returning to freedom . Back to Lenin , to his teachings , to his cause ! .. . 2 . Wingate , London , 1951. 3 . The Trial of the Sixteen ( Zinoviev , Kamenev , and others ) took place in August , 1936 . All defendants were executed .  | Reiss was wrong in assuming there was a return to freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to Stalin could hope to escape the revenge of the man who said that " sleep is sweetest after you have settled an account with your enemy . " Reiss had remained a sincere Socialist , a Communist who still believed in Lenin 's ideology . There was no danger that he would betray the secrets of his service with the Cheka to the West . Reiss did not ask for political asylum . He did not contact the authorities in France or seek protection in return for betrayal . All he did was to resign from the Cheka . But Chekists can not resign . Reiss also committed another unforgivable crime . In a postscript to his letter he wrote : In 1928 I was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for services to the proletarian revolution . I am returning it herewith . To wear it simultaneously with the hangman of the best representatives of the Russian workers is beneath my dignity . Stalin 's sleep had been disturbed . The account had to be settled to make it sweet again . So important was the liquidation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enraged Stalin , that three Mobile Groups were ordered to go after the impudent traitor . The over-all strategy of the killing was planned by Colonel Mihail Shpiglglas , deputy chief of the Innostranny Otdyel , who had made a lengthy stop in Paris to inspect the French networks on his way back from the Spanish Civil War . One of the Mobile Groups was headed by a typical Cheka agent , a man of many aliases , known to European counterintelligence organizations as Roland Abyatt , born in London , a citizen of Monaco , and at times a deputy Resident Director in Prague . His alias during the Reiss case was Francois Rossi . Another was under the command of Vladimir Konradyev , for a time in Paris as an official of the Society of the Friends of the Soviet Union , one of the fronts for cultural relations . His network specialized in shadowing Russian emigres in France . A third group of the traveling executioners was headed by Serge Efron , sent to Paris in the  | guise of a correspondent of Soviet newspapers . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom traveled by various routes from Moscow , others recruited from secret agents already in France and Switzerland . An interesting feature of the murder was the role given to the Swiss schoolteacher , Renata Steiner , the only member of the murder gangs actually caught and brought to court , for it reveals how the Soviet secret service treats its dupes . Renata Steiner was born in St. Gall and became a teacher in Zurich . As a student she joined the tiny Swiss Communist Party , and in 1934 , when she was 26 , went on a Intouristconducted holiday tour to Russia . There she was enlisted as a " helper " and directed to get in touch with one of the French networks in accordance with the Cheka technique of not employing agents in their own countries . After two years and another visit to Moscow , Fraulein Steiner decided to give up her teaching job and become a full-fledged Soviet agent . Even so , as the Reiss case showed , she remained only a dupe and was given only minor assignments . In 1936 one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant in a small antique shop in the Rue Bonaparte in Paris , then used as a clearing house for espionage communications of the network run by the agent Larin , secretary of the front organization Union pour le Repatriement des Russes en Russie ( Union for the Repatriation of Russians to Russia ) . In August of that year Renata Steiner was ordered to shadow a Russian couple , known in Paris as Monsieur and Madame Leo Sedov . She did not know that Leo Sedov was the son of Leo Trotsky , that her shadowing was merely the prelude to the murder of Sedov , who was liquidated by Konradyev 's Mobile Group on February 16 , 1938 , six months after the murder of Ignace Reiss . She trailed the Sedovs on their journeys to Holland and Switzerland , and reported on the men they met . One was " a man with thick-lensed glasses . " This man was Ignace Reiss , then still a high Cheka agent , who had secretly contacted Trotsky 's son . For her expenses Renata Steiner was given amounts  | between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . When she was finally ordered to join Efron 's Special Tasks Group she was paid 20 francs a week , even in 1937 a ridiculously small salary . In August , 1937 , the search after " the man with the glasses " became frantic . Reiss had thrown out his challenge in his letter in July . Now he was not merely suspected but sentenced to death . The agents discovered that on his return from Holland he had hired a small apartment in the Avenue Mozart in Paris , where he lived with his wife and child under a false name ? he had still a number of passports supplied to him as Resident Director by the Tayny Otdyel ( the secret section ) of the Cheka . Suddenly Reiss , probably suspecting he was being watched , left for Switzerland , using a Czech passport in the name of Hans Erhardt and leaving his family behind in Paris . The executioners rightly decided that Reiss would wait until he thought his trail was cold and then ask his wife and child to join him . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he disappeared , Madame Reiss and her child left for Switzerland . She tried to cover her trail , going first to Berne , then traveling by a devious route through western Switzerland , and finally stopping at a hotel at Montreux . In the meantime Reiss had settled down at Finhaut , a small village on the slopes of the Mont Blanc , only a few miles from Chamonix , the famous French frontier winter sports resort . The Efron group had trailed him but found it impossible to carry out their orders because he rarely left his hotel , sitting on the terrace and chatting with other tourists . It was decided to lure him away . Renata Steiner , who had a Swiss car license , was ordered by Marcel Rollin , one of the agents with whom she worked in Paris , to go to Berne and look out for a man whose description she was given . She was to give him a sealed letter . She arrived in Berne on August 28 , was approached by a man who gave her the agreed password @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ilotel City where a room had been booked for her . He told her to go to the Casino Garage and hire a car and gave her 200  | Swiss francs in case the garage should ask for a deposit . Renata did as she was told . Then without explanation the man , who was Roland Abyatt , alias Francois Rossi , ordered her back to Paris . The gang had decided that Renata might prove too inexperienced to be involved in the real business . Rossi took the car and told her not to worry . But no sooner had Renata returned to Paris and reported to Rollin , than she was ordered back to Berne . The gang had lost the trail of Madame Reiss and decided that Renata might be useful in picking it up as she knew the Reiss family by sight . On September 3 , Renata was back at the City Hotel in Berne . There she was met by a middle-aged , gray-haired woman who introduced herself as a German comrade . The woman was Gertrude Schildbach , one of the few female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time deputy Resident Director in Rome . Madame Schildbach told Renata that she would accompany her to Finhaut where " the man with the glasses " had been located . The two women traveled as far as Salvan , where Madame Schildbach told Renata to get out and go by bus to Finhaut to look for the " man with the glasses " and discover whether he had been joined by his wife and child . The day after her arrival at Finhaut Renata saw the Reiss family at the station , buying tickets for Territet . She immediately telephoned Rossi , who was at the Hotel de la Paix in Lausanne waiting for the call . The message was short and to the point : " Uncle had left for Territet . " " Take the next train to Territet and look out for uncle , " Rossi instructed the girl . But for three days Renata wandered through Territet without finding a trace of the Reiss family . She phoned the Hotel de la Paix at Lausanne , but Rossi had left . Finally , running short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the garage what had happened to the hired car in which she had left Madame Schildbach . The proprietor of the Casino garage put her in his office and two garage hands planted themselves at the door . Renata suspected nothing until half a dozen detectives , summoned by the proprietor , jumped from two police cars . During her travels  | Renata had read no newspapers and knew nothing of the murder in the Boulevard de Chamblandes at Lausanne . To the gang she was , of course , expendable . She had served her purpose . Efron , Abyatt-Rossi , Konradyev , Madame Schildbach , and the other executioners had completed their work and had dispersed . Renata was tried for being an accomplice before the fact . Her defense was that she did not know that she was a tool in a conspiracy to murder . All she was told was that " the man with the glasses " was a Franco agent spying on Spanish refugees of the Civil War , and she agreed to frustrate his sinister activities . The Swiss jury believed that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence of eight months . None of the murderers were ever caught , although the investigations established beyond doubt that some well-known Soviet agents in Paris were involved . Most of them had by then left France but even those , like Larin , Grosovsky , and two officials of the Soviet Trade Delegation who , if nothing worse , stage-managed the murder , were not apprehended . Some officials of the Soviet Trade Delegation were questioned , but the Soviet Embassy claimed diplomatic privilege and no arrests were made . The French police made an interesting discovery whose significance was not appreciated at the time . Roland Abyatt had , shortly before the murder , applied for a visa to Mexico . He produced a passport issued by the Principality of Monaco , probably forged , in the name of Francois Rossi . The Department for Special Tasks had already in the summer of 1937 prepared the assassination of Trotsky who , after his wandering across Europe , had settled in Mexico . On August 24 , 1936 , the Supreme Court of the U.S.S.R. added to its verdict by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zinoviev , Kamenev , and Smirnov , were sentenced to death and duly executed , the following rider : Leon Davidovich Trotsky ana his son Leo Lvovich Sedov now abroad , convicted by the evidence of the accused , and also by the  | findings in the present trial as having prepared and directed the organization of terroristic acts against the GPU and the Soviet state , are subject , in the event of their being found on the territory of the U.S.S.R. , to immediate arrest and trial by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the U.S.S.R. It was extremely unlikely that Trotsky and his son ( who had been given refuge in France ) would ever be " found on the territory of the U.S.S.R. " as long as the Stalin regime existed . Hence the sentence had to be carried out by traveling executioners , wherever and whenever the condemned might be found . I have dealt with the murder of Reiss in some detail because its planning , execution , and the subsequent investigations by the French and Swiss police show many interesting features . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely because the Cheka agents planned so efficiently . It is now clear the Paris Surete had secret instructions not to delve too deeply into the Reiss case and there is a lesson to be learned . The French government in 1957 was anxious not to disturb the pleasant relations with Moscow , based on the French-Soviet friendship pact . In January , 1936 , Laval 's cabinet had fallen over the Abyssinian crisis and been succeeded by the Socialist Leon Blum , who enjoyed the support of the French Communist Party which , of course , was Stalinist . Even after Blum 's downfall in April , 1937 , his successor , Daladier , not only retained Socialist support , but relied on the Popular Front cooperation with the French Communists . It was tempting for the French authorities to close their eyes to the activities of Soviet agents . This was the necessary price for the friendship of Moscow which French statesmen of that period greatly valued . A whole series of murders committed by the Mobile Groups in France between 1936 and 1939 therefore went unpunished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On January 21 , 1937 , Dimitry Navachin , a former Soviet diplomat , was murdered in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris . He  | died two days before the purge trial of the Seventeen , including Pyatakov , Radek , and Sokolnikov , having declared publicly in Paris that he was prepared to give evidence before an independent tribunal anywhere in the West about the real background of the Moscow trials . Whether Navachin had any documents and whether his testimony would have turned the tide of the world-wide campaign organized by Moscow to convince public opinion in the free world that the accused were really traitors and Nazi spies , no one will ever know . Two men followed Navachin from his home to the Bois where he used to take a short walk every morning . Under the eyes of several passers-by , one of them fired three revolver shots at him . Navachin died an hour later without regaining consciousness . The Paris police established that the murder was committed with " a foreign-made revolver of 5-mm. calibre , unusual in France . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But nothing that might have led to their arrest came out of the efforts of the investigating magistrate , efforts which did not appear to be pressed with great enthusiasm . After Navachin 's murder , Leon Trotsky issued from his exile a warning that the Cheka had been ordered " to shut up all those who know too much about the Moscow trials . " That the Mobile Groups had received such orders was clear from their activities other than murders . There was a mysterious burglary at the Paris Institute of Political Science , where Trotsky had deposited several trunks filled with documents before going to Mexico . This burglary had never been cleared up , although it seemed incredible that half a ton of papers could be taken away , loaded into vans and driven off , without anybody noticing it . The Cheka undoubtedly had accomplices planted at the Institute . In his warning , Trotsky expressed fears for the safety of h is son , Leo Sedov , hoping that by drawing attention to the danger he would deter the Cheka from striking . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After an attempt on his life by poison in the winter of 1937 , Leo Sedov  | entered a Paris hospital . Doctors advised him a stomach operation was necessary . The operation was carried out and Sedov showed such steady improvement that he was soon to be discharged . Then , on the order of someone who was never identified , his night nurse was suddenly withdrawn . On the very first night Sedov was left alone he had an " unexpected relapse . " At 4 A.M. he was found by a night porter wandering through the corridors of the hospital , naked and delirious . At least he appeared to be delirious , because he was shouting , " Au secours , au secours , ils m'ont empoisonne " ( Help , help , they 've poisoned me ! ) . The circumstances of Sedov 's death were so suspicious that the hospital called in the police . The forensic pathologist came to the conclusion that " Sedov 's death could he explained by natural causes , " but they recommended an open verdict . A hospital porter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrogated , but the magistrate decided that there was insufficient evidence to bring a charge . The special-task agents were now in a hurry . ' Hwy pounced on Rudolf Klement , Trotsky 's secretary , who had remained in Paris because he was unable to get a visa to Mexico . Klement acted as a liaison officer between Trotsky and the many groups of Trotskyites in Europe . On July 16 , 1938 , Klement left his home and never returned . About three weeks later the headless body of a man recovered from the Marne River near Lagny was identified by several people as that of Klement . These and other Cheka victims in France at that period were only the residue of the wholesale massacre of Trotskyites , antiStalinists , and Communists suspected of deviation carried out by the Cheka during the Spanish Civil War . In his book , Assassins at Large , Hugo Dewar gives a fully documented account of the Cheka activities " in Europe 's little Russia , " the Spain of the revolution and counterrevolution , between 1936 and 1938 . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of hundreds of Trotskyites , Socialists , and " nonconformist Communists " in Spain . In the East and in the West the executioners of the Cheka worked according to a carefully devised plan . Spain provided an excellent opportunity of eliminating opponents of Stalin 's policy of Soviet imperialism , because so many of his exiled enemies were assembled in one country where sudden deaths and disappearances would be hardly noticed in the chaos of civil war . The " official , " that is the Stalinist , Communist Party in Spain had played a much less important part in Spanish politics than the Trotskyite groups and the Socialist , syndicalist , and anarchist parties . Moscow foresaw the danger of the Stalinists being left out in the cold in the event of the Republicans winning , with a bourgeois left-wing coalition in control . Indeed , some Spanish Loyalist leaders have argued that Stalin would have preferred victory for General Franco to his defeat by a regime not after Moscow 's choice . The small " official " Communist Party was overshadowed by the Partita Obrero de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , known by its initials as POUM , and led by Andreas Nin . After escaping in 1920 from Spain , where he had been sentenced to death for Communist activities under the regime of King Alfonso XIII , Nin lived in the U.S.S.R. But in 1928 he broke with Moscow , switched his loyalty to Trotsky , and founded the POUM , which at the outbreak of the civil war became the real party of the Spanish working class . From all over the world , thousands of Trotskyites , Socialists , and left-wingers streamed to Spain to rally behind the Loyalists , and particularly behind Nin , who was an inspiring leader . The various factions of the Republican coalition were at first united in the common aim of defeating Franco . But soon violent quarrels broke out between the POUM and the official Communists , and between them and the anarchists , and various Communist organizations and the bourgeois government of the Republic . All this is in the history books . Not so well known is the role of the Cheka and its agents provocateurs and stool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | unit of the international brigades , and the Republican army for the purpose of provoking and enlarging these differences . In May , 1937 , when the Republicans were already hard pressed in Madrid , fighting broke out among the defenders . This fighting was provoked by a leader of the " official " Communist Party , Salas , who was a Cheka agent and in command of the " Special Guards " in Madrid . The blame for the fighting was immediately put on Nin and his POUM party . While Gel man and Italian guns pounded the starving capital , the Communist organ of Lerida proclaimed that " The POUM and its leader Nin must be exterminated in the interest of the freedom of Spain . " In June , 1937 , Nin was " arrested " and disappeared without trace . This was a signal for the massacre of all anti-Stalinists . Among the victims of the " Assault Guards " ? the official name of the Cheka Mobile Groups in Spain ? were Professor Jose Robles of Johns Hopkins University , U.S.A. , who had returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the famous Menshevik Abramovich , Kurt Landau , leaders of the Trotskyites in Germany and editor of their Central Ili in ) eau organ Der Funke , Camillo Berneri , an exiled Italian Communist leader , Erwin Wolf , a Czech , who was at one tulle Trotsky 's secretary , Henry Moulin , a French Communist , and many others . A number of Englishmen , volunteers of the International Brigade , were murdered by the Cheka . Among the better known were Bob Smilie of the I.L.P. , tortured to death as a " POUM spy " in the Cheka prison at Valencia , and Hamilton Gold , a radio technician at the Barcelona transmitter , who was kidnaped by Cheka agents , put aboard a Soviet ship hound for Odessa , and never seen again . While the Trotskyite opposition outside Russia was being eliminated in Spain , Stalin 's prominent opponents were liquidated in Moscow . The big trials of August , 1936 , and January , 1937 , dealt with Kamenev , Zinoviev , and 27 others , but in spite of the Cheka 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime in the eyes of the world . In a few months 3000 officials of the Commissariats of the Interior and State Security  | were arrested and most of them shot . Even Stalin appears eventually to have feared the purge he ordered was going too far and would decimate his secret service to the point where it was useless . Yezhov , head of the Cheka , was sent to a mental asylum , to be heard of no more . Behind the Cheka 's astonishing internal massacre was fear that too many knew too much . Even with his political opponents at home and abroad eliminated , Stalin did not sleep sweetly , because too many knew the truth . There were the traveling executioners still abroad , and Cheka chiefs who had been concerned in manufacturing the evidence for the purge trials . The Soviet agents abroad were ordered home . From Spain came Geikhis , the Soviet ambassador , Milhail Kholtzov , ; who had gone to Spain as a Pravda correspondent and become Resident Director , General Kleber , commander of the Soviet " volunteers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chekists and Red Army officers . Within a few months of their arrival from Barcelona they all disappeared . The position in the foreign service was complicated by the fact that many of the Cheka officials serving abroad had bee involved in earlier cases of murder in the Soviet Union . It the Cheka 's policy to interchange officials between external art . internal departments , so that men concerned with censorship or labor camps may find themselves appointed for foreign service and vice versa . The result was that some of the men con cerned in the murder of Kirov in 1934 and in other mysterious deaths were abroad in 1936 . Altogether about 40 important foreign agents , including several Resident Directors , were recall to Moscow and shot without trial . Some refused to obey and remained abroad , but the lo arm of the Cheka finally reached them . General of the NKVD Walter Krivitzky , Resident Director in the Netherlands , su . vived until 1939 , when he was put to death in a Washington hotel . Alexander Orlov , formerly chief of the Economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1936 to advise of counterintelligence , has survived and recently published an ac- count of Stalin 's Secret Crimes . The Cheka 's traveling executioners accounted for most of the others . It would be impossible to mention all the executions at home carried out by the Cheka , but that of Slutsky , chief of the Foreign Department of the secret service , is worth noting . Slutsky was considered too important to " disappear " like many other chiefs , at least until the important task of replacing the foreign agents with new , " reliable " men had been carried out . On February 17 , 1938 , Slutsky 's deputy was called to a room where he found Slutsky slumped on a chair . On a table in front of him were half-empty tea glasses and cakes . A circular to all the Resident Directors abroad told them that their chief had unfortunately suddenly died of heart failure . The use of poison had apparently been introduced by Yagoda when he became Menzhinsky 's deputy . In his younger days Yagoda was a pharmacist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section for Special Tasks , installed in a well-equipped laboratory in the Lubianka . Yagoda himself liked to carry out experiments there . During their trials Yagoda and his secretary Bulanov " confessed " to murdering Kuibyshev , Gorky , and Peshkov by supplying the poison the doctors administered on their orders . Trotsky commented in his life of Stalin : 6 The confessions of poisoning ... seemed fantasmagoric to me . Subsequent information . . . forced me to alter that judgment . Not everything at the trials was a lie . There were poisoned and poisoners .... Not all the poisoners were sitting in the prisoners dock . The principal poisoner was conducting the trial by telephone . . . . Yagoda would not have taken it upon himself to kill Gorky and still less would he have dared to entrust such a plot to a Kremlin physician . . . . All the details bear Stalin 's ineradicable imprint . . . . It is only Yagoda who disappeared ; his poison chest remains ... . The evidence of Khokhlov makes it clear that Yagoda 's poison chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1938 the Cheka had eliminated all serious opposition . Only one account remained to be settled , that of Leon Trotsky himself , then living in exile near Mexico City . The task was entrusted to Beria , with the proviso that it must be carried out with no chance of the crime being brought home to Moscow . Two and possibly three plans for the murder of Trotsky were prepared . One of these , a pure gangster attack , was carried out in May , 1940 , by Spanish and Mexican Communists led by three Cheka agents , wearing Mexican Army uniforms secured by Marteo Martinez , leader of the Mexican Communist Party . Trotsky 's American secretary , Robert Sheldon Harde , was kidnaped and his body later found in a shack . On the night of May 23 the gang stormed Trotsky 's villa , throwing incendiary bombs and firing submachine guns . Trotsky and his wife survived the volleys poured into their room by diving under the bed , but their 11-year-old grandson was wounded . The attackers were eventually driven off by Trotsky 's bodyguards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified . Trotsky now fortified his house so that direct attack with anything less than tanks would be useless and Moscow ordered the alternative plan , prepared 18 months before , to be put into action . The world was preoccupied with the holocaust in Europe , so that both the fantastic attack in May and the subsequent more subtle and successful murder received little space in the newspapers . On August 20 , 1940 , Trotsky took into his study a man called Jacson , who had been introduced to him by Sylvia Agelov , a fervent supporter and a friend of his wife . Trotsky had promised to help the young man with an article . As Trotsky pored over the manuscript , Jacson standing behind him took a short-handled ice pick from the pocket of his raincoat and struck him on the back of the head . The point of the pick entered Trotsky 's brain . He screamed , and his wife and bodyguards came running . Trotsky cried , " He must not be killed , he must talk . . . the GPU sent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the bodyguards seized Jacson he made a strange remark : " I had to do  | it , they have something on me . . . they are holding my mother in prison . . . ! " Jacson gave the Mexican police the name of Van den Dreschd and said he was a Belgian . There was much mystery over the man 's name and he was officially called Mornard . He claimed he had killed Trotsky because he was horrified to find that he was really an enemy of the working classes and actually tried to persuade him to go to Russia to assassinate Stalin . It . was a fantastic and unbelievable story . After protracted investigations which showed that both Jacson and Van den Dreschd were false names , the murderer was tried and sentenced in April , 1943 , to 20 years ' and one day imprisonment . The world was then torn by war , and only afterward , with the aid of the police of half a dozen countries , was it possible to discover the true identity and movements of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . When in 1939 Beria looked for a suitable man to penetrate the protective screen with which Trotsky had surrounded himself , he was given the name of Cardidad Mercader , a Catalonian woman who had been a Cheka agent since Iwo , had received espionage training in Moscow , and had headed an espionage cell in France . She had been one of the Cheka 's important agents under Mihail Shpiglglas in the Spanish Operation and now , in 1939 , lived in Paris . She was ordered to find a suitable man to become friendly with some Trotskyites in Paris who had the leader 's confidence . Repulsive as the idea seems , Cardidad Mercader chose her own eldest son , Ranson Jacobo del Rio Mercader , then working for the Comintern in Paris . He succeeded in making friends with Sylvia Agelov in Paris under the name of Jacson . She went to New York early in 1939 , and Jacson followed her in September , using a Canadian Passport No. 31,377 issued to Antoni Babich in 1937 . Babich was a Yugoslav naturalized in Canada in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain in 1936 . The passport was one of the hundreds filched by the Cheka during the Civil War . Although he was now Babich to the U. S. immigration and  | police authorities , Mercader lived in New York as Jacson and was briefed by the Cheka Resident Director whose cover name was Roberts . He told Miss Agelov he had business in Mexico City ? later police investigation showed that the address he gave her was one of a man involved in the first attempt on Trotsky 's life . He arranged that when she came to Mexico she would introduce him to Trotsky from whom he wanted advice about his writing . Trotsky was extremely cautious in meeting strangers , knowing that he was a marked man . But eventually on a farewell visit , Sylvia Agelov brought Jacson with her , introduced him , and Trotsky promised to give him advice . Sylvia returned to New York . Jacson followed her and wrote to Trotsky , thanking him for his kind reception and hoping to have his advice when he next visited Mexico . This was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times when he returned , but always when others were present . He appeared to have ample funds , bought an expensive American car , and gave Sylvia $3000 , telling her he had made a large , unexpected profit on a business deal . Then came the fatal visit of August 20 and the murder . It is now clear that during the last months Jacson showed some signs of restiveness about the murder , perhaps because he realized that he had no chance of escape and would almost certainly himself be killed by Trotsky 's bodyguards . This was Moscow 's plan ? there would be no danger of a dead Jacson telling who had sent him . To make sure he went through with it , Moscow recalled his mother and his younger , consumptive brother , and Jacson was told they were being held as hostages . This was the explanation of his strange cry , " They have something on me . . . they are holding my mother in prison ! " In the Mexican prison after his conviction , Jacson was almost pathologically terrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected poison in his food , and generally regarded the walls and prison guards as protecting rather than incarcerating him . He knew only too well that orders had probably been given for his liquidation to make sure he would n't talk . In 1945 Moscow released the aged Cardidad Mercader and she  | went to live in Mexico , paying frequent visits to her son . The death of Stalin perhaps gave Jacson more confidence , for in July , 1954 , he applied for parole , but his application was rejected . These cases of murder committed abroad by the Cheka 's agents and its Mobile Groups are only examples from a very long list . It is doubtful whether any complete list can ever be prepared . The solutions to scores , if not hundreds , of " unsolved murder mysteries " in many countries probably lie in the records of the Cheka . I need quote only a few more examples . There was the mysterious " suicide " of Walter Krivitzky , Major General of the NKVD and one-time Resident Director in Holland , who broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel Bellevue , Washington , D.C. , on February 10 , 1941 , two days before he was to testify before the Dies Committee of the United States Senate . There was the discovery of a terribly mutilated body in a French forest a few days before the fall of France in 194o . It was identified as that of Willy Muenzenberg , a former leader of the German Communist Party , who had been followed by Cheka agents ever since his break with Stalin . There was Carlo Tresca , the well-known American labor leader who openly accused the Cheka of the murder of Juliet Stuart Poyntz , an American schoolteacher who had been a prominent Communist . Tresca even named George Mink , a former Philadelphia taxi driver , as one of Moscow 's traveling executioners , who had carried out liquidations in Germany , Denmark , Spain , and the U.S.A. Tresca paid for his boldness with his life , being murdered on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Fifteenth Street , New York City , in 1943 . The assassins were never found , although the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheka agent , who worked in Spain under the cover name Kontralas . He was arrested by FBI agents but released for lack of evidence and later vanished , to reappear as a leader of Italian Communists in Trieste , a center of Soviet secret service activity against both Italy and Marshal Tito . Since the war , the Mobile Groups and Cheka agents have  | been particularly active in Germany and Austria and many kidnapings and murders suggest the old tactics continue . The Khokhlov affair was only the most recent and flagrant example . It may be that since the death of Stalin the Cheka has had orders to show more restraint in the West , but the use of murder and terror as a weapon continues in the lands bordering the Iron Curtain and if there has been any change , it is one of tactics and not of principle or conscience . Stalin has gone , and murders are no longer required to insure his undisputed power , but as I show in the next chapter , the executioners are turning their attention to refugees and emigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusing to collaborate .  | In the chapter on recruitment I mentioned the use of open or subtle threats to people with relatives in Soviet or Communistcontrolled territories as a method of suborning them into espionage . This aspect of the Soviet secret service activities deserves to be described more fully . During 1945 advertisements began to be inserted in Canadian newspapers , particularly in those published in the Ukrainian , Polish , and Lithuanian languages , stating that persons who came from areas incorporated into the Ukrainian and Byelorussian Socialist Soviet Republics as a result of the war were required to register at offices opened by the consular department of the Soviet Embassy . It is astonishing that such advertisements were permitted , since it was not within the power of the Soviet Embassy to order anyone in Canada to do anything . But Pavlov , the head of the Cheka in Canada , who carried out the operation , relied on the good will extended by the Allies toward the U.S.S.R. to carry off this bluff . The Canadian Royal Commission was presented with no concrete evidence of sinister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no doubt about its purpose . " Soviet officials are working on the Canadians of Russian and Ukrainian origin , " he said . " They try to develop those people as a Communistminded population . They use the fear that their relatives will be persecuted in the home country . That is no joke . It is the real thing . They may say to a man , If you do not agree to work for us , your sister or brother may be liquidated . ' " The Soviet secret service learned this technique from the Nazis , who before the war went to great trouble to get into touch with the hundreds of thousands of Germans and persons of German birth scattered over the world . Relatives in Germany were traced and their well-being used as a threat if there was any reluctance to cooperate with the Gestapo agents and Nazi spies abroad . Only a small percentage were actually pressed into espionage by the Nazis , but all were on tap for use if required . The exposure of this registration in Canada , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territories , was not sufficiently noted in other countries . The use of exiles , emigrants , and refugees by the Soviet secret service ? and even more so by the secret services of the satellite countries , which the Cheka controls ? has continued and has been systematically developed , as the Petrov inquiry in Australia confirmed . The increasing importance of Australia as an industrial power , as a key nation in Far Eastern defense , and as the scene of secret tests of atomic weapons and guided missiles , led to a special effort being made by the Cheka to use immigrants for its purpose . Tens of thousands of East Europeans had come to Australia since 1948 from Displaced Persons camps in Germany , most of them people who had been deported by the Nazis from Poland , the Ukraine , and the Baltic provinces for forced labor in Germany but who were not inclined to return to their homes after having seen life in the free world , even from the squalor of the camps . Many of them founded clubs and societies in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-Communist leaning . When appointed in 1951 Petrov was given as one of his  | major tasks finding recruits among the anti-Soviet organizations in Australia . He was appointed third secretary at Canberra and put in charge of the consulate so as to gain the diplomatic immunity essential in making the necessary contacts . Sooner or later an immigrant may have reason to make a simple inquiry at the consulate of the country of his birth . This inquiry immediately makes him a marked man for the Soviet secret service . In 1951 a Colonel Gordeyev was sent from Moscow to Australia for the specific purpose of developing contacts among immigrants from East European countries . In 1953 one Pavlov arrived to work with Gordeyev ? whether this was the same Pavlov who was the MVD man responsible for the Canadian activities in 1945 has not been made clear . Gordeyev and Pavlov toured the country and Petrov said the stated purpose of helping immigrants was merely cover for espionage . The importance attached to these " repatriation officers " by Moscow was shown by the fact that they were paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presided over by Stalin and later by Malenkov . In 1953 the repatriation committee was dissolved , but this did not end the activity . Platkais , who replaced Pavlov , was simply placed on the Cheka payroll and continued to make contact with immigrants whose addresses were sent him by Moscow as having possibilities . The Cheka obtained the addresses by opening all letters from Australia before delivery . The Soviet secret service thus discovered the whereabouts of thousands of men and women who had emigrated to Australia . The possibilities lay in the fact that they had relatives behind the Iron Curtain who could be treated as hostages . As with so much Soviet secret service work , there is a double intention . Only a small proportion of the immigrants are likely to have knowledge of , or access to , secret material , since in most democratic countries , apart from other qualifications , immigrants are automatically barred from many official positions or secret work . There are few recorded instances of the Soviet secret service obtaining anything of value by this method . But the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secondary dividends they secure . The immigrant feels he or she has a " hostage to fortune " and is encouraged to take a conciliatory attitude toward the U.S.S.R. or , as Gouzenko put it , to become " Communist-minded . " They become , in the course of time , full citizens and electors of the country of their adoption and can , to that extent , influence policy trends . There is the further object that in the event of the situation becoming revolutionary , pressure could be brought to bear on them and they could be given the standard military tasks ? many are employed in transport and public services where they learn no secrets but hold positions that would be important in the event of actual uprising . At worst there is the hope that producing a sense of insecurity , distrust , and anxiety in these now very large groups , a feeling that the all-powerful hand of the Kremlin stretches even across thousands of miles of ocean into the heart of democratic countries , serves the general purpose of weakening the capitalist countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relatives still in Russia being used as pressure by Soviet agents occurred in 1944 . One of the persons questioned by the Royal Commission in Canada in 1946 was Hermina Rabinowitch , born in Lithuania . She was a highly educated and indeed brilliant woman , speaking five languages . She had found employment at the International Labor Office in Geneva in 1929 , and in 1940 went to live and work in Montreal . Documents from the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa mentioned her , and some were in her handwriting . She was a reluctant witness , taking the position that she had been innocently used as a tool . The Commission 's examination showed that on the instructions of a Soviet agent in Geneva ( " Sisi " ) connected with the I.L.O. , she went to the Soviet authorities in Canada and eventually was in touch with " Gisel , " code name for the Red Army Military Intelligence organization . From the Soviet MI she received $10,000 , which she managed to get passed to this agent in Switzerland through New York , for use by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , needless to say , quick to appre- ciate the advantages in war time of the uncensored I.L.O . mailbag , which may have been the reason for the first approach and the search of the Central Index for a suitable person . Miss Rabinowitch later supplied " Leon " ( Sergey Koudriavtzev , Soviet Embassy first secretary ) with information about the I.L.O . " Anybody was entitled to this information , " she told the Commission , but could not explain why , in that event , she had handed it over at secret street meetings arranged each month , instead of posting it . The Commission appreciated , even if she did not , that apparently " harmless " biographical information about people in the I.L.O . and their political sympathies might be of great value to the Soviet secret service . However , the interesting point about these episodes was her explanation : " I was very happy about being in Canada and I never had the slightest thought to do anything against the hospitality which I received here , or which could do any harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities ; and when I had certain contacts with the Soviet Embassy , there were certain ideas behind it which have nothing to do with being an agent or no agent .... As I said before , I had seen my family at that time in Russia , and I once already had a visa for them to come to this continent ; but they were not released out of Lithuania and perished there later on . But at the time I still had reason to hope they were still there and still alive , and as a matter of fact I learned only much later that they died just at the end of the German Occupation . . . . I had perhaps the foolish idea that with rendering services to A  --  and to Rachel I might have some kind of possibilities in helping my parents and relatives who were in very great danger there , in Lithuania . My parents were already old at that time . I thought mainly of my father and mother . As I said before , I was used just like a tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did not get anything from them , because the small service I asked for they did not render it to me , even when I asked for my parents . . . . I did n't feel that I was doing any harm in contacting these people . Only later , when I saw all this secrecy and all that business , I disliked it very much .... "  | " I did n't feel that I was doing any harm in contacting these people .... " For how many skilfully drawn into the net would this serve as an epitaph ? In this case the promise made to help relatives could not , in any case , be kept because they were already dead . Generally it is not a promise to help , but a threat to hurt , and the refugee from Russia knows that the threat is no empty one . In the last five years the pressure on refugees and emigrants has steadily increased . The methods vary . In some cases the refugees have received letters , accompanied by literature . These appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugees could have been discovered only by snooping . Ukrainian textile workers in Lancashire began receiving letters correctly addressed to their new lodgings although they had only just moved . No matter how often a man changed his address , the letters followed him and in at least one case letters were addressed to men from Lithuania , bearing their works numbers at their factory . This was not only testimony to the efficiency of the spy service the Russians had secured , but also no doubt intended to give the impression that the Cheka was all-seeing . Letters were followed by calls . To the ordinary man brought up in a democratic country , a knock on the door means a friend or tradesman calling . To the refugee from a land of secret police a knock on the door , especially at night , has a sinister sound . The callers were from the Soviet Embassy , making inquiries about nationality , next-ofkin , and so on . The calls were perfectly legal . The necessary notice had been given of visits to areas outside London , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent visits to these textile workers , who did not realize there was no compulsion to answer questions and that any molestation would entitle them to police protection . The atmosphere of fear spread among the foreign workers in Britain and questions were asked in Parliament . But there is no law against propaganda and only in cases where the secret service agents went too far was it possible to take action . There were some typical cases , illustrating the technique .  | Stanislaus Bajder , a staff sergeant in General Anders ' Polish Forces , settled in Britain after the war . He became an official of the anti-Communist union which looked after the interests of Polish workers in Britain . But his wife and child were still in Poland . He was contacted by agents and threatened with reprisals on his family by the Warsaw government if he did not help to build up dossiers on his fellow refugees . He had spent 12 months in a Russian prison at the beginning of the war and knew what that meant . He agreed to cooperate and through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered to set up headquarters in Manchester . It was there that Special Branch officers found him ? and he was deported . The knocks on the door dreaded by so many refugee workers in Northern England stopped . But only for a few months . Within a year the Cheka had established another " pipeline " to Warsaw supplying names , addresses , and personal details , and the letters and knocks on the door began again . Since 1950 the Special Branch of Scotland Yard have found at least 13 Poles ? since deported ? engaged in espionage . They secretly met Polish Embassy officials , the favored meeting place being a taxi . In some cases they were recruited as a result of open or implied threats to relatives in Poland , but in others the Soviet secret service took advantage of the fact that the West has thrown open its doors to refugees to " plant " skilled agents posing as refugees . These activities are carried out in all countries where there are substantial numbers of immigrants or refugees . Often where cases are brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal charges but simply deportation proceedings , carried out with a minimum of publicity . In J95i3 as a result of complaints by East European immigrants who had been pressed to give secret information on the defense industries , the police in Canada found that Soviet agents had secured admission to the country as bona-fide refugees . They settled near defense industry plants and sought to force into espionage genuine immigrants with relatives behind the Iron Curtain .  | The weapon of blackmail has been made more powerful by the fact that under the Yalta Agreement Soviet subjects in Germany at the end of hostilities could be forcibly repatriated when discovered . To avoid this thousands of Russians and satellite citizens ? some of whom had collaborated with the Nazis ? adopted false names and identities , so that they could remain abroad , and were helped by the " blind eye " of sympathetic Allied officials . As the years passed , a search in the Moscow Index turned up the true identity of some of these exiles and made them ideal material for blackmail , since they were technically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cases , if the true facts were known to the British , American , or other authorities concerned , the refugees could have the position rectified , but many are understandably fearful of coming forward and telling the truth to get rid of the blackmail . The Soviet secret service and its creatures in the satellite countries are not likely to relax their pressure on the millions of refugees and immigrants . From those who have lost everything , even their relatives , or have managed to bring them out with them , secret agents get a cold and hostile reception and have little hope of success . Such hopes as they have will grow less with the passing of the years as the immigrants learn their rights as citizens in a free country and the instinctive fear of the knock on the door grows less . But with those who have left behind hostages , the pressure is a strong one and the fear that going to the police will bring the very reprisals it is desired to avoid is real . There are indications that the Soviet secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and counterintelligence organizations of the Anglo-Saxon countries have decided it is not sufficient to wait for complaints to be made but that with many workers from abroad engaged in vital industries , they must take the initiative in protecting them from attempts at terrorization . The Soviet secret service is finding it more difficult in 1954 to carry out what had become almost a routine ? first , the literature and newspapers from the home town , then the knock on  | the door to ask whether they would not like to be repatriated with free passage and the certainty of a fine job , and finally the invitation : " No doubt you prefer to stay because you are truly patriotic and realize you can serve the country of your birth better by supplying us with information . . . . " The British police have photographs of some of the Soviet or satellite agents and ask immigrants if they recognize the faces in their " Rogues ' Gallery . " Knowledge that this is being done is in itself a deterrent to agents active in this form of espionage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful are the ties of the family to the exile , and they may feel confident that in many cases agents will deliberately not be recognized by those questioned out of fear of reprisals . Until a year or two ago Moscow did not take seriously the various " free " organizations formed by men and women from behind the Iron Curtain in the countries of the West . But the Cheka has begun to realize that some of these organizations have attracted determined men who have taken up the offensive . The N.T.S. ( Society of National Unity ) , formed by antiCommunist Russians in Western Germany , with groups in Britain , the United States , and other countries , has become a really big worry to Moscow , since it started to publish pamphlets and newspapers which are smuggled into Eastern Germany , distributed among Red Army soldiers , and even find their way into the Soviet Union . The decision to send a " murder gang " to Frankfurt to assassinate the chairman of the N.T.S. , Mr. Okolovich , shows that the Cheka has recognized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Cheka has now a special section whose task is to counteract the propaganda of these anti-Communist Russian societies . The Soviet government appears to be less keen now to accept refugees who want to return . They suspect that repatriations may result in receiving as many Western agents and antiCommunists as " penitents . " Not only Soviet agents seeking information but also executioners are working amongst the immigrants and refugees .  | There are at least seven unsolved murder mysteries in Britain alone , where the victims were Poles , Ukrainians , Czechs , or Lithuanians and in which all the circumstances point to the work of traveling executioners . They include Michael Bazyock , found hanged in a field near Reading in 1949 ; Waclaw Silko found hanged in the same area in 1950 ; and Mrs. Irena Tolloczko , who was killed under mysterious circumstances , after receiving a visit from a stranger . At the time of writing it is a year since Father Henry Borynski , 42-year-old chaplain to the community of about 1500 Poles in Bradford , disappeared without trace from his lodgings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorkshire , and Father Borynski was fearless and outspoken in urging his flock to resist them and not to be afraid . He is listed in the file of " missing persons " and , as in other cases , the police admit that unless a new lead is given by someone , their inquiries have come to a dead end . No one who knows the methods and record of the traveling executioners can have much doubt that the facts are known in Warsaw and Moscow .  | Intelligence for world revolution requires world espionage . There are about 20o countries enjoying varying degrees of sovereignty in the world , ranging from the United States of America to the Principality of Monaco . Whether a country covers half a continent or is a mere speck on the map , there are Soviet agents at work in it , generally sustained by a well-organized Communist fifth column . However remote or peaceful the place , it may hold importance to Moscow for one reason or another . Sparsely populated sub-Arctic regions are today the lanes of long-range air communications . Equatorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American republic becomes important because of its neighborhood to the Panama Canal . In all such places Soviet agents are not less active than in the capitals of great countries ; and Soviet submarines , fishing trawlers , and whaling ships roam the oceans carrying agents who contribute their part . The targets of the Soviet secret service are unlimited and in a short chapter it is possible to give only a sketch showing that the examples quoted could be multiplied with variations in  | any part of the world . Starting in the high north , we find six Finnish nationals being tried in July , 1954 , at Vaasa , the second major spy trial in Finland in six months . In both cases the accused were fishermen and reindeer shepherds from Lapland who had sold information about frontier defenses to the Cheka . They were encouraged with vodka and big meals to cross into Soviet Karelia . But these were only two cases of many concerning Soviet espionage in sub-Arctic regions . Asbjoern Sunde , a well-known leader of the anti-German Resistance in Norway during the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norwegian Army officer , three years . Sunde had worked for the Soviet spy network since the war , and on one occasion before his arrest in December , 1953 , had escaped from the police in a motor car registered with the Soviet Embassy . Moscow 's regard for Sunde was shown by the money lavished on his defense and by the efforts made by the Soviet secret service to plant false evidence to secure his acquittal . A commentary on the methods of the Soviet secret service was the discovery that one of the Soviet networks in Norway worked behind the front of the Commission for the Care for War Graves . Some 200 Soviet citizens died in Nazi concentration camps in Norway during the war and a few Red Army men were killed in the liberation of the most northern province . As a gesture of friendship the Norwegians allowed a Soviet commission to care for the Russian cemeteries inside Norway . This was used as cover for espionage . Security considerations have prevented full publication of the known exploits of Soviet agents in Norway , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of a series of trials between 1951 and 1953 . Admiral Helfe Stromback , Commander-in-Chief of the Swedish Navy , stated the damage done was irreparable . All the secrets of Sweden 's defenses had passed to the Soviet agents during the previous ten years . At least five parallel networks were shown to be in existence , working undisturbed since 1941 . On September 12 , 1951 , Ernst Anderson , an officer of the Swedish Navy , obtained five days ' leave from his duties in  | Stockholm to attend to some urgent family matter . But instead of going to his home town of Nassjo , he traveled to Karlskrona , Sweden 's chief naval base . He returned to the capital on September 20 and went to an ice-cream parlor where he took a bicycle left for him by Nicolai Orlov , an official of the Soviet Embassy . He rode to the Southern Hospital , and left the bicycle in the entrance hall , after placing some papers in the tool bag and in the tube of the pump . Anderson had been followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the papers were copies of secret documents ? written in invisible ink ? relating to the equipment of Swedish warships based on Karlskrona . At Anderson 's trial it was shown he worked for a spy net under the control of the Resident Director , Victor Anissimov , chief correspondent of Tass . Anderson had joined the network in 1946 , being recruited by a Swedish Communist , who introduced him to Vinogradov , then second secretary of the Soviet Embassy . Among information obtained by Soviet agents from Anderson were copies of secret documents of the armament , disposition , and state of readiness of the Swedish Navy , the defenses of all naval bases , details of possible landing points and defenses on the east and west coast , and details of the fortress of Boden , Sweden 's bastion against invasion . With money given him by the Resident Director , Anderson had bought an expensive camera and photographed airfields , notably at Sweden 's main air bases at Lulea . A parallel network accomplished even more in the political , industrial , and military field . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stockholm . They were members of the spy ring directed by Arthur Karlsson , who nominally held the humble job of a doorman at the office of the Communist newspaper Ny Dag . Chief agent of this network was Fritjof Enbom , a 33-year-old journalist and former officer of the Swedish Army . For ten years ? since 1941 ? he had been organizing a nation-wide spy web and had recruited a large number of novators and informants . The targets given him by the Moscow directorates were : ( a ) . To provide a force of 200 saboteurs , able in the event  | of war to blow up the central arsenal and the power station at the fortress of Boden , disrupt railway transport , and spread confusion among Swedish troops and civilians by broadcasting misleading orders from a clandestine radio station . ( b ) . To organize among Communists and Communist sympathizers an " activist group " in north Sweden to prepare Red Army invasion of the country , and ( c ) . To provide detailed information about iron-ore fields and industrial plants . Enbom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gjersfold , a former army sergeant . The plans provided for the fifth-columnists , armed with weapons sent from Russia , to seize certain frontier fortifications along the invasion route and , hiding in trees , to report on the movements of the defending Swedish forces . When the agents were arrested , police found a radio transmitter already supplied through the Soviet Embassy to Enbom , as well as general staff maps , charts , military photographs , detailed drawings of frontier defenses , and much other material , and an arsenal of small arms . A railwayman , Fingal Larsson , had a complete plan for sabotaging the railway system in northern Sweden . Other agents had collected highly secret information on the heavy and medium guns sunk into granite platforms , the pride of Sweden 's defenses in the frontier and coastal regions , automatically loaded and radar-controlled . Enbom and Gjersfold received life sentences and other agents prison terms ranging from two to eight years , but the damage had been done . Sweden had always maintained that in any future world conflict , her policy would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the complete information Moscow had received about Sweden 's defenses had not destroyed the military basis of that neutrality . While the trial was in progress four members of the Soviet Embassy and 22 members of the consular and trade mission staff and their families embarked aboard the Soviet steamer Beloostrov from Stockholm to Leningrad . Several of them had , been accused at the trial , but the Swedish government was un- able to proceed against them , because of their diplomatic status . With the Soviet officials went Seth Persson , a leader of the Swedish Communist Party , Gustav Johansson , former editor of Ny Dag , and a Swedish employee of the Tass agency . Turning to the other side of the world , we find Soviet agents active in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of Siberia and Alaska , which have become of immense importance . Strategists regard the North Pole route as the major lane for atom bombers in a future world war . The United States has been spending enormous sums on the development and defense of Alaska , which is uncomfortably close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in turn , has established secret air bases . America and Siberia are separated by only 58 miles of water , and midway in the Bering Strait lie two islands , the American Little Diomede and the Soviet Great Diomede , only two miles apart . Soviet bases now exist not only in northern Siberia but also in the Kuril Islands and the Komandorskiye Island north of Japan . Soviet agents have been trying to penetrate Alaska and the Aleutian Islands . That they make imaginative use of any opportunity was shown when General Walter Bedell Smith , then chief of U. S. Central Intelligence , received a strange report from one of his agents . An Eskimo team had crossed the Bering Strait to play football against a team of Alaskan Eskimos . Among the Siberian players were several Russians ? their " make-up " as Eskimos rather obvious . They carried miniature photographic cameras ! Returning to Europe , we find there is no country in which Soviet agents have not been successful in recent years . The discovery of a large network in the Low Countries was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left a cigarette package containing secret messages in a streetcar shelter at The Hague , which was used by the Soviet agents as a post box . The couriers who delivered and collected the messages were watched , and Oldrich Neumann , who worked nominally as an accountant at the Czech Embassy in The Hague , was unmasked as one of their chiefs . It was discovered that assignments were being given on micro-film transmitted in split picture post- cards bearing conventional holiday greetings from Scheveningen and other seaside resorts . The hoary method of sticking messages under cafe tables with chewing gum was used in Brussels and Antwerp . The information supplied to Soviet agents in Belgium included descriptions of airfields used by British and U. S. airplanes , the deployment of troops , details of dikes and coastal defenses and supplies received from the U. S. for the Dutch and Belgian forces . Espionage in Western Germany has been so continuous and extensive that it would be impossible even to list here the many exposures . Since the discovery in 1946 of the first big network of the Cheka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been a month without a spy case in the three Allied zones . A notable case was that of Michael R. Rothkrug , a 52-year-old former U. S. intelligence agent , who was tried before Judge Dewitt White of the American Control Commission in January 1953 , accused of stealing top-secret documents . Rothkrug , a resident of Westport , Connecticut , had an excellent record with the U. S. intelligence during the war . After resigning in 1952 , he opened a business in Berlin with a German partner . But this was merely cover for his activity as a Soviet agent , so successful that it was necessary to give the evidence at his trial in camera . The exploit of an agent who in 1951 apparently managed to photograph the private diary of Major General Robert Grow , U. S. military attache in Moscow , when he visited the U. S. headquarters in Frankfurt , made front-page news . There was no suspicion that the diary had been tampered with until six months later quotations and pictures appeared in a book published in East Berlin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by Major Richard Squires , a British officer who vanished in Germany in 1947 . In Frankfurt the Soviet secret service appears to have worked the " beautiful woman spy " trick with great success . Maria Knuth , an attractive German actress , entertained British and American officers at her luxurious flat in a Cologne suburb . She was caught by M.I.5 agents in the Central Post Office in Cologne with documents that are said to have shocked Allied  | commanders . She had for several years kept Soviet agents informed of military dispositions , airfield construction , the development of West German police and frontier forces , and plans for the new German Army . Inspector Hermann Westbold of the Frankfurt police , regarded as particularly trustworthy by the Allies , confessed that he had been a Soviet agent for several years . He was paid ? 45 a month . Four other members of the network were arrested , but the chief agent was never caught . The spies had operated a portable radio transmitter . Whatever view is taken of the crossing into the Soviet zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret service , in July , 1954 , it was clearly a triumph for the Soviet secret service and more than compensation for the defection of Khokhloy and other Soviet agents , who had come over to the Allies in Germany earlier in the year . These are only a few instances from scores . The existence of some 5,000,000 Communists in Western Germany means that the Soviet secret service has little difficulty in obtaining information or smuggling agents and contraband . The position is similar in Austria where , as I have mentioned , the Cheka has a branch office of its Section for Terror and Diversion in a former imperial residence at Baden , some 15 miles south of Vienna . One of the recent big espionage cases in Austria concerned a network directed by two former U. S. army officers , Otto Verber and Kurt L. Ponger , who had joined the Soviet secret service after being recruited by Yuri Novikov , second secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Washington , in 1947 . Both had gone to the U.S.A. as refugees and , after naturalization , joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intelligence Corps . They worked as interrogators in the Nurenberg War crimes trial of Goring , Hess , and other Nazis . Later they returned to New York , applied for GI grants to study at Vienna University , and thus became Soviet agents at the expense of the U. S. taxpayer , who even paid for their families to join them ! Their work for the U. S. Intelligence Corps during the war made it easy for them to mix with Allied officers . Their indictment before a federal grand jury in Washington in 1953 listed  | 14 major charges , each punishable by death . Security prevented the full extent of their activities from being disclosed . A third member of the network , Walter Lauber of El Paso , Colorado , fled to the Soviet zone of Austria while on bail . Nearby Switzerland , traditionally neutral , had been a hunting ground and meeting place of spies of all nations in two wars . But Switzerland , while joining no alliance , had made clear her resolution to defend herself if attacked and is therefore of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Lucerne Nova Vita publishing house of Dr. Xavier Schmeisser , specializing in Christian literature and even publishing anti-Communist pamphlets . This was an effective cover for espionage . After years of successful operation as publishers of religious literature , Schmeisser and another agent , Rudolf Roessler , aroused suspicion , and a police raid on their offices brought to light 16o micro-filmed espionage reports . Investigation showed that this Avanpost originated at the Soviet spy center at 192 Route de Florissant in Geneva , where during the war two radio stations operated with remarkable success , keeping Moscow informed from a source in the German high command . The Resident Director , Hungarian-born Alexander Rado , spent 300,000 Swiss francs in 1946 setting up a new network . The Swiss federal president has openly charged the Swiss Communists with being in the pay of Moscow . One of its leaders , Leon Nicole , was a Pravda correspondent and represented the Tass agency . In France and Italy Communists have substantial parliamentary representation and the Soviet secret service is well entrenched , with agents in every government office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cheka misses no opportunities was shown in May , 1952 , when it was announced by the Vatican that Father Alighieri Tondi , professor at the Gregorian Academy of the Vatican , had been found to be a Soviet agent , " deliberately planted in the Jesuit Order . " The raids ordered by the French government in 1952 produced a great number of secret documents relating to NATO and France 's own defenses . With 800,000 actual and 5,000,000  | potential Communist Party members in the country , Soviet agents find espionage in France comparatively easy . The exposure of two Soviet networks in Paris and Lyons in 1952 provided as much material as the discovery of the Canadian spy ring . The French counterintelligence and the NATO headquarters were confronted with the fact that virtually all French defense secrets had been betrayed . Among maps found by the French authorities in the possession of Soviet agents was one showing almost all NATO installations in France , identifying the location of seven army camps , 13 bulk fuel depots , 15 munitions dumps , 12 air bases , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 Allied air bases , seven military test ranges , two rocket sites , four mine areas , and two munitions factories in the Western German zones adjoining France . A list contained the names and positions of 244 American officials and organizations in Paris , apparently prepared for the Moscow Index to be used on some future occasion . In Toulon it was found that Cheka agents had formed a cell within the ranks of the police and the naval security forces and had been receiving detailed accounts of military convoys passing through the port on their way to Indochina . Branches of the networks were discovered at Lyons and Clermont Ferrand , the important industrial centers . At Lyons a number of genuine official seals , which had disappeared from government and military offices , were found being used by the agents for forging identity papers and credentials to enable them to enter secret armament plants and military depots . Officers of the Suretes Special Security Branch declared the networks exposed were " only a few cogs in an espionage organization with much bigger ramifications . " And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet agent , identified by his code name " Mayen . " Others claimed diplomatic privilege or simply disappeared , leaving the Communist dupes and novators to their fate . Successive French cabinets have been reticent about publicizing either the spy trials or the investigations of counterintelligence organizations . This has been due not only to anx- iety to avoid conflict with Moscow , but also because general appreciation of the vulnerability to espionage would make Britain and the U.S.A. reluctant to share secrets and weapons with France . A French politician , speaking of the " catastrophic extent of espionage " in France , estimated there were 200 Soviet networks using more than 20,000 full-time agents . I do not know the evidence on which this was based , but I am certain that the Cheka agents in France today , with the Communist fifth column , could provide an alternative government administration and an alternative army without difficulty in the event of an uprising in a future war . If I needed corroboration for this contention , it was provided by the events in Paris when these lines were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Committee of National Defense of the French government , M. Jean Mons , was charged with " damaging the security of the state , " after two of his high officials , M. Rene Turpin and M. Roger Labrusse , were arrested on charges of treason . They were accused of having supplied top-secret documents concerning French defense and military plans relating to NATO to a Communist agent , Andre Baranes . Only two high officials had the right to attend and take notes at the secret meetings of the National Defense Committee . One of them was M. Mons whose two chief aides , Turpin and Labrusse , were able to see these notes and minutes , and who transmitted them to the Communist emissary . Already during the initial stages of the interrogation it came to light that these " leakages " had been going on for more than 15 months , at least since July , 1953 . There can be no doubt that the Soviet secret service as well as the French Communist Party are now in the possession of some of the most closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French Republic but also of NATO , as far as these have been made available to the French National Defense Committee . In spite of the suppression of Communism in Spain and General Franco 's totalitarian regime , the Soviet secret service has never ceased to be active there . This activity was immediately increased when the United States began to rearm Spain and  | develop bases . Three agents were uncovered at Bilbao in 1953 They had been sent to Spain by a roundabout route from the Berlin-Karlshorst Cheka center , apparently charged with sabotage at the new factory where prototypes of a new jet fighter were being built by Hitler 's famous aircraft designer , Professor Messerschmitt . It was stated that a high Franco government official , Fernando Mondala , was a Soviet agent , which shows that the Cheka is able to infiltrate not merely the governments of democratic countries but also totalitarian ones . In the Balkans after the war the Soviet secret service had serious setbacks with the crushing of the Communist EAM rebellion in Greece and the breakaway of Marshal Tito . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far too extensive to describe here . Interested readers can find the astonishing details in the 48o closely printed pages of the White Book issued by the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs . That the attack continues is shown by the periodical arrests and trials of agents . With the defeat of open revolution in Greece , the Soviet agents concentrated on discovering the details of NATO installations and American bases . The trial of Nicholas Beloyannis and 28 others in Athens in 1952 disclosed the amazing efficiency of the networks operating under difficult conditions . Two powerful radio transmitters had been installed at Villa Avra , eight miles from Athens , and in a building in the Kallithea slums of the capital . Messages in cipher were sent regularly to Bulgaria and on to Moscow . Typical messages quoted at the trial were : On . . . island between Rhodes and the Turkish coast big installations for U.S. superforts and submarines . Deep underground tunnels and depots . Only reliable Turkish labor employed under strict American supervision . At Goudi American ammunition depots are four meters below ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosive depots . Between Megara and the hill is a secret airfield , where training aircraft land .  | One of the transmitters had been assembled from brandnew accessories of American origin which the agents and their Communist helpers must have obtained from U. S. stores . The other transmitter was Russian and the mystery of how it was smuggled into Greece remains . Even after the exposure of three networks between 1951 and 1953 , the Greek authorities believe that other parallel networks still exist . In the Middle East the Cheka has been able to combine espionage of military secrets with the exploitation of nationalist movements to discredit the British and American imperialists . In Persia , after the Tudeh Party , controlled by Soviet agents , was outlawed in 1949 , Cheka agents in great numbers entered the country to set up fronts , such as the Society for Freedom of Iran and the League Against Imperialist Oil Companies . Mullah Kashani , spiritual head of the most fanatical nationalists , admitted his connection with Communist agents , and links between the Moslem Brotherhood and Soviet agents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1954 ) governments in Teheran and Cairo and the smaller Arab states are strongly anti-Communist , but they are militarily weak , while on the frontiers of Turkey , Persia , and less than 200 miles from the Iraqui oilfields is a well-disciplined " army of liberation " under General Mustafa Barzani , leader of the Soviet Kurds . There are 4,000,000 Kurds in the Soviet Caucasus , Turkey , Syria , Iran , and Iraq , and Moscow has promised them the establishment of a sovereign Kurdistan . Documents found on Soviet agents in the Middle East in 1954 showed that the invasion routes into Turkey and to the oilfields of Iraq through Kurdish territory have been carefully mapped . In the Far East the number of Cheka agents engaged as " instructors " and espionage organizers may have been comparatively small , but they played a key part before the outbreaks . Today there is no place of importance in Asia outside the " Bamboo Curtain " where the Soviet secret service has not an Avanpost , and conditions make it possible for them to work without being unduly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony than many people believe . It seems that Peking , aware that its own agents are not sufficiently trained and experienced , is willing to accept the guidance of Cheka emissaries and Chinese agents are often subordinate to a Soviet Resident Director . This appears to be particularly the case in Indonesia where Western counterintelligence has found some of the best organized and most efficiently run Avanposts in the Far East . The key man is Wang Jen-shu who led the Communist bands in the revolution in 1948 against both the Dutch and Indonesian authorities . He later went to Moscow and returned in the autumn of 1951 , nominally as a diplomatic representative of the Chinese People 's Republic , in fact as the chief representative of the Far Eastern Otdyel of the Soviet secret service . With the liquidation in 1954 by President Magyaysay of the Communist Huk guerrillas in the Philippines , Moscow suffered a severe setback , but there is evidence that action was taken immediately to replace the losses with new Soviet and Chinese agents from Jakarta in Indonesia . The chief Communist agent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but an American , William Joseph Pomeroy , born at Rochester , N. Y. After a good education Pomeroy joined the Young Communist League of America at the age of 18 , in 1938 . He served with the U. S. Fifth Bomber Command and took part in the liberation of the Philippines . After the war he studied at the University of the Philippines under the GI Bill of Rights , and married a Filipino girl . Just when he joined the Soviet secret service is unknown , but eventually his activities led to a price of $30,000 being put on his head when he fled to the Sierra Madre . Upon capture he was charged not merely with being a Communist spy but also with several murders , arson , and kidnaping . Documents and notes found on him referred to Pedro de la Pena , a high official in the Republic 's Ministry of Defense and chief of its intelligence service , an ardent anti-Communist who wrote bitterly against Russia and China in the paper Free Asia , owned by his friend , millionaire Antonio Chua Cruz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both  | involved with Soviet and Chinese espionage networks and that the money with which they had been lavish had been raised by blackmail and extortion . Chinese in Manila had been mulcted of 10,000,000 pesos under threats to their relatives in China . The unmasking of these networks showed how the Communist secret services combine legitimate intelligence work with extortion rackets . Similar methods have been used against the Chinese in the U.S.A. , particularly in San Francisco . Japan has a strong Communist fifth column which , in spite of General MacArthur 's confident assertion that it had been " decisively defeated " four years ago , now virtually controls some powerful trade unions . There is no doubt that infiltration of government and police offices has resulted in an efficient organization for espionage . Turning south we find that the defection of Petrov and inquiries of the Royal Commission on Espionage in Australia showed that this continent had been the target of a determined attack by Soviet agents . It is clear that Petrov knew only part of the Australian story and that there are parallel networks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another network which attempted to get information about the uranium deposits on the Edith River and near Radium Hill . Petrov 's defection did not mean a vital blow to Soviet espionage in Australia except to the extent that it roused the Australians to the danger . New Zealand of all the countries in the world has probably proved the most difficult for Soviet agents to penetrate . The attempt to recruit Maoris for Communist agitation was a failure . The general lack of Communist success in New Zealand may be due to the fact that it is a small and prosperous country with a homogeneous population . The Western hemisphere is regarded by Moscow as the " heart of capitalist encirclement of the Soviet Union . " Both North and South America represent the " young and vigorous power of capitalism " ? in the south in its cruder form ? not yet affected by disintegration evident in the economic structure  | of the European continent . Until the last world war the Soviet attitude to South and Central America was based on the worldrevolutionary doctrines of Communism . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the government for its Communist avant-guards in Latin America , rather than to aim at immediate Communist revolution . This change of policy explains the more subtle activities of Communist leaders , Moscow emissaries , and agents of the Soviet secret service south of the United States . Guatemala is a good illustration of these tactics . In 1952 the Communist Party of Jose Manuel Fortuny was a small organization composed largely of intellectuals and students . There also was the large Workers ' Party , led by Victor Manuel Gutierrez , member of the Guatemalan Congress , boss of the 50,000-strong trade unions federation . Gutierrez was invited to Moscow , received by Stalin , and treated as a very important guest . Soviet agents gave orders to the handful of " official " Communists in Guatemala to treat the Workers ' Party and Gutierrez as allies . When he returned home the two parties were fused . Guatemala had a strong united Communist movement , which soon became the strongest political force in the country , influencing and often dictating the policy of President Jacobo Arbenz 's government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ espionage networks , important because of the proximity of the Panama Canal , undisturbed until Arbenz and his government were overthrown in the summer of 1954 . Similar tactics have been tried in other Latin American countries , though with less spectacular success . Communist propaganda and the activities of the Soviet agents make use of the nationalist resistance to American capital and " Yanqui imperialism . " Recruits are looked for in nationalist , liberal , and intellectual circles , rather than among the underprivileged . Any attempt to describe the world-wide ramifications of the Soviet secret service in a few thousand words must be inadequate , but even this glimpse of the world-wide web suggests its great size and extraordinary ramifications . It remains to glance at Soviet activities in the United States , now Moscow 's most  | important target . The publicity that accompanied the exposure of the " atomic spies , " the confessions of Whittaker Chambers , and recent Congressional investigations whose reports fill many large volumes , has undoubtedly given the impression in Europe that Soviet espionage in the U.S.A. has been important only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spy nets originated in 1919 when the " Red scare " which swept the United States as a result of near-revolutionary industrial strikes resulted in Communist organizations being declared illegal . They were driven underground and the Comintern took advantage of the conspiratorial atmosphere to set up its networks for the Cheka . The two American Communist parties united in 1922 , and Moscow 's emissaries took control of the 16 foreign-language federations and groups in the new party organization . The first important Soviet agents were Ludwig Karlovich Martens , a Russian of German origin , and Joseph Pogany , better known under his alias of John Pepper , who had been war commissar in Bela Kun 's " hundred days " Soviet regime in Hungary . Martens was deported in 1921 with his lieutenant , " Adams , " a young man whose antecedents and identity had remained a mystery , but who returned in 1942 an experienced Cheka agent to assist in atomic espionage . From the beginning there was closer liaison between the Communist Party and the Soviet secret service than in any other country . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Moscow was not so much interested in America 's military secrets as in weakening her capitalist structure . Infiltration of unions and industrial organizations and even government departments to influence policy rather than espionage was the aim . It is worth recalling the instructions given by Stalin to American delegates to the congress of the Communist International in 1929 . I consider the Communist Party of the United States one of the Communist Parties to which history has given decisive tasks from the point of view of the world revolutionary movement . The revolutionary crisis has not yet reached the United States , but we already have the knowledge of numerous facts which suggest that  | it is approaching . It is necessary that the Communist Party of the United States should be capable of meeting the moment of crisis fully equipped to take direction of the class war in the United States . You must be prepared for that , comrades , with all your strength and with every means . You must forge real revolutionary cadres and leaders , who will be capable of leading the millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ambiguity about the " tasks , " and the Comintern and the Cheka agents in the U. S. went on the offensive together with the leaders of the American Communists . The importance Moscow attached to the United States at this time can be shown by the quality of the chief agents it sent . The political angle was entrusted to Sergey Gusev , who with Alfred Tilton shared the rank of Resident Director . Gusev , who used Green , Drobkin , and other aliases , held the rank of major general and was one of the highest officials of the Cheka . The Cornintern sent Sirola , former chairman of the Finnish Communist Party , under the code name " Miller . " Much of the work was based on Soviet trading missions and " commercial firms " such as Prodexco , Inc. , and the Amtorg Trading Company , on the same pattern as Arcos , Ltd. , in London . Some of the finance was supplied by the sale of Tsarist jewels smuggled in by sailors of Wollweber 's International Seamen 's Union . At one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lydia Stahl , one of the Cheka 's most experienced agents in Western Europe , who figured in the Switz spy ring . She was given the task of making contacts with government officials and service officers . These contacts proved valuable in later years and are believed to have been the basis of the Ware Group , the first spy cell in the administration of which ? Whittaker Chambers and Nathaniel Weyl alleged ? Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White were members . The financial and economic troubles of 1929 provided great opportunities for spreading the network . It was in this year that Pavel Mikhailov , mentioned in connection with atomic espionage much later , arrived in the U. S. He held the rank of deputy chief of the Foreign Division of  | the Cheka , and Congressional investigations suggested that with Gerhard Eisler he established the first cells in the U. S. Treasury , the Department of Agriculture , and even the State Department . Eisler has been mentioned many times and the only point I make here is that , having been known for years to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless allowed to land again in the U. S. in 1941 as a refugee and worked unhindered until 1947 , when sentenced for contempt of Congress and ? released on bail ? was still allowed to escape . This seems to be typical of the inexplicable tolerance of the U. S. authorities in dealing with Soviet agents . Again , whatever may be the truth about the activities of Alger Hiss , there is no doubt that the notes of Assistant Secretary of State Adolf A. Berle on his conversation with Whittaker Chambers remained locked in the State Department 's safe for years until they were turned over to the FBI in 1943 . The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and entry of the U. S. into the war gave Soviet secret agents a new lease of life . Because America and Russia had become allies it became easy to place new agents and , as Elizabeth Bentley revealed when she broke with the Communists in 1945 , she alone had contacts with 8o , 37 of them in government employment . During the war the Soviet secret service worked its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other places of importance . In a single raid on the offices of the Communist magazine Amerasia in New York , agents of the OSS and FBI seized 1700 documents , ranging from top-secret to confidential , coming from every department of the administration and the Pentagon . Six arrests were made but only two persons went on trial on charges of " stealing government property . " They paid fines of $3000 and were released . The astonishing cases of Adams being allowed to escape and Golos being fined for a technicality when both were known as master spies , I have already mentioned . The United States has been for three decades subjected to a determined attack by the Soviet secret service . This attack has been as successful as in any other part of the world and it seems  | clear that , even though the nation 's leaders must have been aware of it , there was incompetence , inefficiency , and sometimes , we must feel , downright stupidity . Compared with the many major cases in the U.S.A. , the " escape " of Burgess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given any secrets to Russia ? was a triviality . Even the mistakes that allowed Fuchs and Nunn May to slip through the British security net were no more glaring than hundreds of similar ones on the other side of the Atlantic . Some failures of the British counterintelligence have been the subject of much criticism in the United States and were cited as one of the reasons for the decision not to share atomic secrets , a decision which did much to impair Anglo-American relations . Yet the heart searching that America has done in the last few years shows that damage inflicted by Soviet agents in Britain means nothing compared with that they have inflicted in the U.S.A. Moreover , this damage continues . Representative Clarence Canon , when chairman of the Appropriation Committee of the House of Representatives , said there were at least 4500 Soviet agents working in the U. S. known to the FBI . How many more were unknown and therefore the more dangerous , we can only guess . The United States has been no more successful than Britain in countering the attack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its extent until recent years . Then , rather suddenly , came the awakening . The reaction was so violent that it may yet result in another triumph for the Communists , because it has created distrust both among American citizens and between the U.S.A. and her natural allies .  | Soviet secret agents and Cheka officials followed immediately in the wake of the Red Army in 1944 as it advanced into Poland , Czechoslovakia , Romania , Hungary , and Bulgaria . With the help of the Communist resistance groups which had fought the Nazis , they organized the political police and secret services of the liberated countries while battles were still raging . Even during the period when there was some pretense at democratic government in Prague and Warsaw , the Cheka , " the sword of the revolution , " was firmly established as a government within a government . It insured that whatever motions were gone through with ballot boxes , power was wielded only by those who looked to Moscow for orders . Later , the heresy and breakaway of Tito resulted in the Cheka taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the satellite countries of Eastern Europe . Today the secret police and espionage departments of the five satellite countries in Europe are either supervised by Soviet officials of the Cheka , or as in Eastern Germany and Albania , run by officials appointed by the Cheka . The Ministries of  | State Security and Interior Affairs in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary , Romania , and Bulgaria are modeled on the pattern of the MVD , and the Ministers are veteran agents of the Cheka who worked for the Soviet Union for many years and not for their own countries . Men like Bierut and Radkiewicz in Warsaw , Nosek in Prague , Chervenkov in Sofia , and Draghici in Bucharest were appointed by Moscow eight years ago , and it is noteworthy that they have survived the splits and purges which have torn the Communist parties of Eastern Europe since 1945 . Many of the " national " Communist leaders who had important positions during the liberation period have fallen and been executed . But the Cheka men remain . This has been possible because , as with all Cheka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loyalty to their country or even their party comes a long way behind . The skill of Moscow in picking and training these men has enabled the Soviet secret service to add to its own networks abroad a great number of agents . Even though Russians enjoying diplomatic privileges abroad have always been more numerous than the corresponding number of foreign diplomats and trade delegates in Moscow , there has been a limit to the number of Soviet diplomats that any country would entertain . Through control of the secret services of the satellite countries Moscow was able to expand the number of its agents working abroad under cover at many more embassies , consulates , and trade missions . In addition to the Soviet Embassy in many countries there are now Czechoslovak , Polish , Romanian , Hungarian , Bulgarian , and even Albanian legations or diplomatic missions , whose members enjoy special privileges . Moreover , every front can be increased sevenfold . The possibility of " friendship societies " and " cultural organizations " is not limited to the U.S.S.R. but can be duplicated with each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to record that in 1954 Britain had three military attaches accredited to Moscow , but there were 22 military attaches from Iron Curtain countries in London . The combined number of all-Communist diplo- mats enjoying full privileges in London was nearly 20 times as large as the number of British diplomats in Moscow . True , Britain also maintains embassies in Warsaw , Prague , and other satellite countries , but the 20o Communist officials are concentrated in a single city , while the British diplomats are spread through Eastern Europe . The same conditions apply to the United States and many other countries . Instances of Soviet espionage by proxy through satellite agents have been given in previous chapters , notably in connection with the " knock-on-the-door " spies . In 1952 the U. S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee , inquiring into subversive activities , reported that " the Czechoslovak Embassy and its consulates in New York City and Pittsburgh were bulwarks in the espionage network operated by Moscow . " The subcommittee had evidence from Matt Cvetic , an agent of the FBI , who had succeeded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was accepted as a novator and was able to pass information to the U. S. counterintelligence . He testified that the Soviet secret service in the United States controlled a " nationality commission " composed of agents in the espionage service of several of the satellite countries , led by from 12 to 18 Cheka agents . Zdenek Palma , the Czech consul in Pittsburgh , was named as a secret agent who had played a prominent part in the nationality commission . Another case revealing the close link between Soviet and satellite agents was that of Christache Zambeti , first secretary of the Romanian legation in Washington , who was involved in one of the many cases of attempting to recruit informers by blackmail . Mr. V. C. Georgescu , a Romanian who represented an American oil company before the war , had to leave behind in Romania his two young sons . He tried to get permission from the Romanian government for his sons to join him in the U.S.A. for many years , but was always refused on the ground that the boys were Romanian citizens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Georgescu was approached by secret agents who put it to him that if he provided certain secret information about U. S. security , he would be rewarded by his sons being  | allowed to go to America . Mr. Georgescu refused and informed the FBI . As a result the first secretary of the Romanian Embassy was forced to leave the U.S.A. He was the fourth Romanian diplomat declared persona non grata by the U.S. State Department . Two counselors , Gregore Protesea and Alexander Lazareanu , and a clerk , Dimitru Sterian , had already been unmasked as secret agents and expelled . The cooperation of the Iron Curtain secret services might be taken for granted as quite natural and usual between allies . Britain , the U.S.A. , France , and other NATO countries also exchange their intelligence information . But the evidence suggests that there is not so much collaboration as command by the Soviet secret service . The results of espionage work conducted , for instance , by Czech agents , would be passed to Moscow , but Warsaw or Budapest might not be told . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on direct or indirect orders from Moscow , would not benefit any other of the satellite governments , except through Moscow . In one way this gives the Iron Curtain secret service an advantage over the secret services of the Western Powers . While collaboration between the intelligence agencies of the British Commonwealth and the United States may be close , it has no single direction . The evidence suggests that the Soviet secret service has wide control of all the agents of the satellite countries abroad . This is the result of the Cheka 's control of their headquarters , so powerful that governments of the satellite countries have delivered their own citizens to the Cheka , a feature of life behind the Iron Curtain that the average man in the West finds particularly repulsive . While the nominal top officials of the satellite security organizations may be nationals , the Cheka has its own centers in all the Eastern European capitals , gives orders to the Ministers of the Interior and the police , and has inspectors and agents in all police , security , and intelligence organizations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Communist parties in the satellite countries in 1947 , the Cheka bosses behind the scenes appoint and dismiss officials in all ministries and departments concerned with security . Moscow is  | better informed on decisions and activities concerned with espionage by Czech , Polish , Hungarian , Romanian , and Bulgarian agents than the governments in Prague , Warsaw , Budapest , and Bucharest and Sofia who pay them . Cheka agents spy on the citizens of the satellite countries , intercept their mail , tap their telephones , and arrange arrests and deportations without interference from the various Democratic People 's Governments and often without even their knowledge . That Moscow was able to establish rule by the Cheka in the satellite countries was the result of a policy decided upon long before the end of the war , and it is worth recalling the mistakes made by the West at Yalta and Potsdam which enabled this policy to be put into practice . All the countries which are now ? satellites were subjugated by Hitler . At the Potsdam Conference it was agreed that " free and unfettered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In different ways what seemed fair governments were set up . Moscow knew that it was of little importance what form of government was set up because in every case the Ministries of Interior and Justice , controlling the police and prisons , went to its nominees and because Cheka emissaries or national agents sent from Moscow had infiltrated the police and armed forces . The non-Communist politicians were soon in prison and Cheka men took over . The first country " liberated " on this principle was Poland , where the government was taken over by Bierut , Amsterdam , and Radkiewich , all three for many years top agents of the Cheka . Bierut , now president of the Polish People 's Republic , was born Boleslaw Rutkowski . Bierut was for many years his code name , made up of the first letter of his Christian name and the first syllable of his surname . From the Polish Communist Party , which he joined in 1920 , he went to the Moscow Cheka at the time when it was dominated by Poles . He was Resident Director in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland and using various disguises and aliases , including Krasnodembski and Binkowski , for his underground work . During the war he was made deputy chief of the Polish section of  | the Innostranny Otdyel , under Stanislaw Radkiewicz , and when he became president of Poland his former chief was made Minister for State Security . Saul Amsterdam worked for many years for the Cheka under the code names Dunski , Sandecki , and Henryk . He disappeared during the 1937 purge in Moscow , but must have been forgiven , as he emerged as one of the chiefs of the Cheka in Poland after the liberation . In Romania the coalition government lasted for five months before , under the threat of civil war with the Red Army in occupation , Peter Groza , noted for his Communist sympathies , was made premier on Moscow 's orders . A pseudo-democratic regime continued for two years , until in 1947 the Communists took over . Similar tactics were used in Hungary with a supposed plot to assassinate Matyas Rakosi , leader of the Communist Party , as the excuse for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists in 1947 . In Bulgaria , Georgi Dimitrov , an old Comintern agent and " hero " of the Reichstag fire trial , was maneuvred into power , and his namesake but political opponent , Dr. G. M. Dimitrov , who had become premier as the leader of the Peasant Party , was saved by being flown out of the country in a U. S. bomber . His deputy premier , Petkov , was not so fortunate and a few months later was executed as a Western spy . Czechoslovakia was neither ravaged by the war nor a backward Balkan country ? in prewar days it had the most democratic regime in Central Europe . The Cheka 's work was more difficult and took longer . President Benes was accompanied from London by experienced ministers , and after the general election the Communists , although winning 114 seats , faced a coalition of 186 non-Communist members in the Prague parliament . Moscow decided the revolutionary situation was not yet ripe and must be produced by stages . With the help of Social Democrats and splinter groups , wholesale nationalization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textile , and other major industries , was passed by the Prague parliament . The Communists succeeded in gaining control of all large trade unions and through the Revolutionary Workers Movement ( URO ) set up armed workers ' cadres in every factory and mine . The representatives  | of the URO were given a share in the management of all industries and soon they were in control of 75 per cent of Czechoslovakia 's nationalized factories . Mass demonstrations and parades of heavily armed URO members through the streets of Prague and other cities exercised pressure on the coalition government , already headed by the Communist leader , Klement Gottwald . When in July , 1947 , Jan Masaryk announced that the government would consider sending observers to Paris with a view to participating in the Marshall Plan , Gottwald countermanded the move on Moscow 's order . It was the beginning of the end . Masaryk was openly accused by the Communists of being an agent of the Western capitalist powers and before Czechoslovakia finally passed behind the Iron Curtain in the spring of 1948 , he was liquidated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the Cheka exercised power in the satellite countries and is worth describing in detail , as I have had access to documents which show the part Moscow 's agents played in Masaryk 's strange suicide . After the great purge trial of the Czech Communist leaders in November , 1952 , 11 of the 14 accused , including Rudolf Slansky , the secretary general of the Communist Party , Vladimir Clementis , former Foreign Minister , and General Bedfich Reicin , former Deputy Minister of National Defense , were executed by hanging . The trial followed the pattern of the great Moscow trials in the late 1930 's . Slansky , who as boss of the party organizations had been for years the Czech pocket-Stalin , suddenly confessed that not only had he " spied for the police since 1924 , had been a Trotskyite since 1927 , an agent of bourgeoisie since 1937 , and a spy of the Western Powers since 1944 , " but also that he had murdered Jan Sverma , the Czech Communist hero of the anti-Nazi resistance , and plotted to murder President Klement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same vein , with one exception . The accused " Andre Simone , " described at the trial as a " journalist , " formerly on the Rude Pravo , the Communist organ , was the only defendant who had never held high government office . Simone admitted  | his guilt but said little else . Before sentence was passed he expressed his hope that " some of his previous services will be considered as mitigating circumstances . " When the executions were announced later the name of Andre Simone was given last , following those of the ten high officials , ministers , and generals , and it was added that his real name was Otto Katz , an agent of " Jewish bourgeois nationalists . " There was no reference to any mitigating circumstances , yet Katz-Simone had done good work for the Communists and the Cheka . I knew him well through my work as special correspondent of British and American newspapers between the wars . He was a man of great charm and intelligence , with many appetites and a great liking for intrigue and conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheka agents , probably not for ideological reasons but from an almost pathological desire for power . The charges against him at the Prague trial in 1952 were more likely than not " framed " by his former Cheka colleagues . But for the role he played in the liquidation of the great European Masaryk he deserved to end on the gallows . He has been accused by some students of the secret history of the Cheka , including Trotsky 's widow , of having been involved in the murders of Leon Trotsky and of the German Communist leader . Willi Muenzenberg , who was once his employer . I have no evidence to support this , but it is not unlikely . Otto Katz was 52 when he was hanged , and he had been a Cheka agent for 22 years . He was the son of a wealthy textile manufacturer in Prague , was brought up in luxury , and received an excellent education . His formative years were in the " wild period " that followed World War I , which , particularly in Central Europe , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katz 's friends in Prague was Franz Kafka , the author of The Trial , the morbid phantasmagoria which made him a famous figure in European literature . Katz decided he too must be a famous writer , but his talent was limited . With his father 's money he started a high-brow literary magazine , paid for the publication of a volume of his  | bad poems , and in the end succeeded in being accepted as the leader of a literary band who flattered him in order to scrounge . In the early 1920 'S he made friends in Berlin with a postwar millionaire , Louis Katzenellenbogen , whose wife , Tilla Durieux , rieux , was a famous German actress . Katz talked his rich friend into backing plays which were invariably failures , but achieved his ambition to become a " figure " in Berlin 's theatrical circles . With his friend 's money and the collaboration of Erwin Piscator , a gifted producer , he started a new " left-wing theater , " the Volksbuehne , which became famous . Piscator introduced the " stairs set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real railway engine and the first underwater scene on the stage . He invited a troupe from the Moscow Theater to Berlin and thus for the first time got in touch with Communist circles . Soon the Volksbuehne became a Communist theater , putting on revolutionary plays . Herr Katzenellenbogen lost 2,000,000 marks on these ventures and withdrew . By the end of 1928 Katz was penniless ? his father had lost his fortune during the inflation . For the first time in his life , at 29 , he had to look for a job . He contacted his Communist friends and through them received an invitation to visit Moscow . He returned to Berlin as an agent of the Cheka , after a short training at one of its spy schools . At that time the German Communist leader , Willi Muenzenberg , a brilliant organizer , was head of the Communist pub-lishing house in Berlin and controlled all the Party 's newspapers and magazines in Germany . He made a large personal fortune out of this party work . Muenzenberg was regarded by the Cheka with suspicion because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been guilty of " deviations " from the official party line , and Katz was assigned to watch , him . He became a director of Muenzenberg 's publishing house and did quite well for himself . Then came 1933 and Hitler , and both Katz and Muenzenberg went to France , where Katz was attached to the Soviet secret service network watching Communist emigres from Germany . In 1936 he was given an assignment with the Cheka in Spain . It is here , and later in  | Moscow , that he is said to have taken part in the preparations of the plot to murder Trotsky . The Cheka managed to smuggle him into the service of the Spanish Republican government and , under the alias of Andre Simone , he became director of information at the Republican Spanish Embassy in Paris . Traveling between Paris and Spain , Katz was the chief contact man of the Cheka between the various networks . Katz was one of the Soviet executioners employed in the liquidation of the POUM leaders in Spain , selecting the victims and sending them to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he returned to Moscow in 1937 , during the great purges of the Old Bolsheviks , he was rewarded with the honorary rank of a colonel in the N KVD . Before the outbreak of war he was in Paris again , not as Colonel Katz but as M. Andre Simone . He distributed millions of francs to French newspaper proprietors to influence their editorial policy in favor of the Soviet Union . When France was overrun by Hitler 's panzer troops , M. Simone became Colonel Katz again , a Soviet citizen , safe from German molestations , because Herr von Ribbentrop had signed a friendship pact with Mr. Molotov , guaranteeing protection to all Soviet citizens under German jurisdiction . Katz was probably the only Jew who felt secure in Nazioccupied France . Muenzenberg had broken with Stalinism before the war , was interned by the Vichy government , but escaped with two fellow prisoners and tried to reach Switzerland . His body was found hanging from a tree in France . Muenzenberg 's widow made the following statement after the war : Everything was ready to bring Willy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered within two hours of his escape from the camp . He had a large sum of money on him . Two comrades took all his money and Otto Katz brought these two men to safety . . . . When the situation in occupied France became less comfortable Colonel Katz , now M. Andre Simone again , managed  | to travel via Spain and Portugal to New York . That he could enter Franco Spain , where he was known as a Cheka agent , is testimony to his skill . From New York , where he produced a Czech passport so that U. S. immigration authorities treated ; him as a deserving refugee from Nazi oppression , he went to Hollywood and organized Communist cells among film actors and producers . When at last the FBI became suspicious , he escaped to Mexico . From Mexico , probably in 1943 , Katz went to Moscow . He must have got special facilities , traveling with a Soviet diplomatic passport . When in February , 1945 , the Red Army entered Bohemia , it was accompanied by a large mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NKVD , Otto Katz . Many regarded him as the real power behind the uneasy truce between the Communists and the " bourgeois " parties . In September , 1947 , three leading non-Communist ministers were sent time bombs . The police never discovered the senders , which was not surprising as the Minister of Interior and the Prague police chief were both reliable Cheka men . It was widely believed Katz was responsible . On March 9 , 1948 , Katz , who had become chief of the Government Information Service , announced : The Minister for Foreign Affairs , Jan Masaryk , was found dead this morning in the courtyard of the Czernin Palais , his official residence . He had committed suicide by falling from a window of his study . He had suffered for some time from a nervous breakdown . Next day Dr. Vladimir Clementis , a former agent of the Soviet secret service , was appointed Masaryk 's successor at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs . But neither Katz nor the Cheka could completely suppress the truth of Masaryk 's death . This is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before 5 A.M. the telephone rang in the home of Dr. Vaclav Teply , police surgeon for the Mala Strana district of the capital . The caller , an official of the Ministry of Interior ,  | told Dr. Teply to go at once to the Czernin Palais , where a serious accident had occurred . Fifteen minutes later , the doctor was led by officers of the " Special National Police " ? the Cheka troops of the Prague police ? to a corner of the palace yard where a body lay covered by a blanket . In his statement , which Dr. Teply later dictated to a trustworthy friend , and which he signed in the presence of three other persons , the police surgeon said : A security agent pulled back the cover and I recognized with a shock the pajama-clad man as Jan Masaryk . I ordered one of the policemen to open the pajama jacket , and noticed all over the body traces of bruises and scratches that appeared to be marks of violence . I saw in the nape of the neck the mark of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7.65 mm. - caliber . I thought , this is infamous , a bestial assassination ! A brief examination in the dim light showed that Masaryk was dead . Dr. Teply asked that the body should be carried upstairs so that he could examine the body more thoroughly . The body was carried into the building , and Dr. Teply followed . As he entered , he noticed among the group of police officers and officials , the Minister of Interior , Vaclav Nosek , the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs , Vladimir Clementis , and a civilian who was giving orders . This man was Colonel Otto Katz . They were standing in a group whispering . Then they hurried into the building to the lift , in which Masaryk 's body was taken upstairs . Dr. Teply was told to wait . A few minutes elapsed before the lift came down again , and the doctor was asked to go to Masaryk 's apartment on the third floor . As he entered the room , Dr. Teply noticed that the Minister of Interior , Katz , and other officials were hurriedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picking up from the floor various articles , including a heavy jug and a bottle . Masaryk 's body was laid on the bed . As Dr. Teply began to examine it under the electric light Nosek stepped forward  | and said , " Do n't make so much fuss . This is a clear case of suicide . Write your death certificate . " The doctor was taken aback by the abrupt tone of the minister and said that he must establish the injuries which caused the death . " All right , make it quick , " Nosek ordered , " but it is obvious that it is suicide . " When the doctor tried to disagree , Nosek angrily ordered him ; to go to the next room , Masaryk 's study , and wait there . Before ' he left he noticed " the civilian " ( Katz ) carrying a towel on hi . arm , talking in a low voice to Nosek and Clementis . Dr. Teply heard him saying in Russian , " Do n't be stupid fellows ... After 20 minutes Nosek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body was lying , and where now several other officials ' had assembled . He warned them they must not talk about any ' thing they had seen . " You simply have n't seen or heard a thing . . . 1 " he said . In his statement Dr. Teply said that even the perfunctory , examination he was allowed to make left him in no doubt that ' Masaryk had been shot . Around the wound were traces of scorching . The shot must have been fired with the weapon held at the neck of the victim . The bruises and scratches could only , be explained by a desperate attempt to keep the assassins away . The fracture of the heel and the bruises on both legs and feet ; might have been caused by the fall , when Masaryk was thrown ' out of the window after having been shot , but Dr. Teply be lieved that they had been caused by kicking . The drop from the window was not a long one , and although the courtyard was cobbled , the fall would probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a broken skull , although Dr. Teply could not be certain . Dr. Teply made these depositions in order , as he stated , to ease his conscience . He had no doubt at all that this , was a case of murder . But he obeyed the order by the Minister of the Interior and signed a death certificate saying that it was suicide . Three months later , on June 6 , 1947 , a short notice in , a newspaper personal column announced that Dr. Vaclav Teply had died . His death was later explained as an accident . He had ; taken an injection to relieve a severe attack of lumbago , but he had made a mistake and injected a highly poisonous sub- ,  | stance . As Beria once said : " Any fool can commit a murder . It takes an artist to make it suicide or accident ... " Dr. Teply 's deposition , which had been left in the safe keeping of three trustworthy friends , was smuggled out from Prague in 1951 , and was published on December 29 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. C. L. Sulzberger , stated that he has no doubt about the authenticity of Dr. Teply 's deposition , having made careful investigation in Prague as to the circumstances in which it was made . Jan Masaryk had no illusions as to the fate which awaited him . On March 7 he had asked Marcia Davenport , the wellknown authoress and one of his oldest friends , who visited him in Prague , to travel immediately to London and to see Winston Churchill . She was to tell Mr. Churchill that Masaryk considered his life in danger and to ask whether Mr. Churchill would help him to escape to Britain . Masaryk also asked Miss Davenport to contact Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart and Sir Orme Sargent of the Foreign Office , whom Masaryk knew well when he lived in London during the war , and to request their assistance . Masaryk knew that he could leave Prague alive only by escaping with the help of British secret agents . But before any assistance could be rendered from London , he was dead ? three days after Miss Davenport had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masaryk of planning his escape and that his liquidation was hurriedly arranged . After Masaryk 's death , Katz suddenly disappeared from the limelight . He was " relieved " from his government office and for almost a year nothing was heard of him , until he re-emerged in the modest position of a leader writer for the Rude Pravo . His absence had a simple explanation . After Masaryk 's death , Klement Gottwald ordered his arrest . Whether he was afraid that he was himself next on Katz 's list , or whether he intended to silence the man who knew too much , will probably never be known . During the trial of Slansky and Clementis in 1952 , it was mentioned that Katz " plotted to murder Gottwald , " but further remarks were cut short by the presiding judge . However , Katz was soon freed on Moscow 's order . His services to the  | Cheka ? he was the man who " unmasked " William Oatis , the correspondent of the Associated Press , as an " American spy " ? were obviously appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in office , and Katz was given the job on the Communist organ by his friend Rudolf Slansky . Soon after Dr. Teply 's story was published in America in 1951 , Katz was arrested again , and tried with Slansky , Clementis , and the other " traitors . " After the executions in 1952 , only one eye witness of the Masaryk incident , Vaclav Nosek , survives . At the time these lines were written , he still holds the post of Minister of Interior and nominal head of the Cheka in Prague . Most of the Communist leaders who helped to " liberate " Eastern Europe in 1944 did not last as long as Colonel Katz . As soon as the Cominform , the Communist Information Office ? a Comintern in miniature , controlling the Communist parties in seven satellite states and in France and Italy ? was sufficiently firmly established by the end of 1947 , most of them were ousted or liquidated . By disposing of the " national " Communist leaders , some of whom may not have been as completely servile to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that in none of the satellite countries could anything like a Titoist heresy of national Communism take root . The Cheka stays in the countries behind the Iron Curtain to safeguard Moscow 's rigid control . Its instrument is the widespread web of Soviet secret agents , who report to Moscow on all events , watch industrial production , political education , the behavior of the military leaders , and every aspect of social life in the satellite countries as carefully as they do it in the countries of the free world . In many ways the Soviet secret agents and their helpers in the satellite countries conduct their activities with no less secrecy than outside the Iron Curtain , with the difference and advantage that they do not have to worry unduly about exposure . The spying is done surreptitiously because the Soviet secret service knows that a large part of the population ? particularly in Czechoslovakia and Poland ? is strongly opposed to the Communist re- gime , and because Moscow never trusts even its own friends . By frequent switches of power from one group of Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heresies . The Soviet secret agents are at hand to conduct the periodical purges and to put into power new men , who for the time being are regarded as more trustworthy or at least more servile . The Soviet secret service controls a number of strong espionage networks in Communist China , and particularly in Manchuria and Sinkiang . I believe the assumption that a break between Moscow and Chinese Communists is only a matter of time is based on wishful thinking . But the Cheka has orders to keep a close watch on the Chinese allies . The two main departments of the First Directorate , the foreign division and the division for allied countries , control between them the Chinese Section ( Kitaysky Otdyel ) of the Soviet secret service , which employs a number of Chinese Communists , whose loyalty to Moscow is greater than their loyalty to Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai . Mao Tse-tung has not always been held in such high regard by Moscow as he is now . During Mao 's 20 years of struggle for power , after he became chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switched support to another Communist leader , Li Li-san , the " hero of the Canton insurrection " against Chiang Kai-shek , only to join Mao again , when Li Li-san did not come up to expectations . But Li Li-san was a real Cheka man and would never have indulged in the nationalist heresies of the present leaders of Chinese People 's Republic . Therefore , the Soviet secret service remains vigilant . The Soviet networks in China also provide a number of important links in the Asiatic mesh . From the Avan posts in Canton and Yunnan Soviet agents , in cooperation with their Chinese colleagues , can easily reach the capitals of Southeast Asia , can assist the new Communist state in partitioned Vietnam in Indochina , penetrate into Siam , Laos , and Cambodia , and help the Communist rebels in Burma . The Chinese bases of the Cheka are vital for keeping up the links with " observers " among the terrorists of Malaya , and provide convenient jump- ing-off grounds for Indonesia , which has been regarded for some time as the most promising revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet secret service has a long tradition . It has been used for 3o years as headquarters of Soviet espionage in the Far East and is today one of the centers dealing with espionage against the United States in the Far East . From Foochow , where Soviet agents watch Formosa , Shanghai , Nanking , and Vladivostok , come the reports of the networks , the material collected by agents in Tokyo and on Kyushu about the United States air and naval bases in Japan for transmission to the Moscow headquarters . Whether in occupation of its enemies or its friends , there is no place in the world where Cheka agents do not carry on espionage .  | Whether a particular piece of work by any secret service organization is judged a success or a failure must depend upon the point of view . To take a much-debated case , it has been held to the credit of the British secret service that it detected Klaus Fuchs , obtained a confession from him , and ended the activities of a man of great value to the Soviet secret service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Fuchs was one of their great successes and a British failure , since they permitted an agent to have access to the most important secret information , to make contact with the agents of a foreign power , and to pass information to them undisturbed for many years . That many of their major informants were eventually caught and imprisoned or executed did not make Soviet atomic espionage a failure . For obvious reasons cases of completely successful espionage , where an agent obtains secret information and is never detected , are never revealed , at least for many years . Bearing these limitations in mind , I give in this chapter some examples of the successes and failures of the Soviet secret  | service . In the whole history of espionage , it would be difficult to find a more brilliant success than that of Dr. Richard Sorge , and it is of particular interest not only for its fantastic features , ' ' rarely paralleled in fiction , but also for its demonstration that in spite of the weaknesses and clumsiness of the Soviet secret service resulting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent of great individual brilliance and allow him initiative . On November 7 , 1944 , Richard Sorge , the press attache of the German Embassy in Tokyo , and Ozaki Hozumi , his chief lieutenant in his capacity as Moscow 's chief spy , were hanged three years after their conspiracy had been discovered . But although Sorge 's career as a spy ended before Pearl Harbor and four years before Russia entered the war against Japan , he was described by Stalin as " the man who saved our lives . " Although he was 7000 miles away when the German Army suffered the crushing defeat at Stalingrad from which it never recovered , Sorge was the architect of the victory . The story of the Sorge spy ring in Japan has been told in great detail by General Willoughby , General Douglas MacArthur 's Chief of Intelligence , who was able to include in his book full documentary evidence . Another more dramatic if less documented account has been given by Hede Massing , the divorced wife of Gerhard Eisler . Here it is possible to give only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1895 at Baku . His father , a German engineer , was manager of an oil company and had married a Russian girl . When Richard was still a child the family returned to Germany and lived in Hamburg . In 1914 he volunteered for war service , was three times wounded , and left the Kaiser 's army at the revolution in 1918 to become a student at Kiel University , where , like Klaus Fuchs years later , he became a Communist . He made his pilgrimage to Moscow and in 1924 , after training in the spy schools , was given his first assignments by Pyatnitzky , the Comintern spy master . Sorge had private means ? his father was a well-to-do man ? and he suggested that he should go to London at his own expense . As an agent in  | Britain and Scandinavia during the middle twenties , he did so well that in 1929 he was promoted to a high post in the then Fourth Bureau of the Military Intelligence , a department of the Commissariat of War . But his close connections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorge was one of the few spies who worked for many years for both the Cheka and the military intelligence . In 1934 he was promoted to lieutenant general . He was one of Moscow 's leading experts on Asia and had been in control of the Shanghai network . He was fluent in both Chinese and Japanese , had visited Tokyo many times , and had made many friends among prominent Chinese and Japanese politicians . When Hitler came to power , Sorge suggested he should go to Germany and establish contact with the leading Nazis . In the Soviet secret service Sorge had been known as " Ika , " and he had been away from Germany for eight years , so that the chance of his being identified seemed small . As a Volksdeutscher , a German living abroad , his return would probably be welcomed . The plan was for him to obtain a post in the Gestapo or another Nazi organization where he would be able to obtain information valuable to Moscow . This startling proposal was submitted to Stalin , who knew of Sorge 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reiss , the Cheka 's Resident Director , and through third parties was introduced to the editor of the Frankfurter Zeitung , Dr. Geissenberg , a German nationalist of the old school who had many friends among the Nazi leaders . Sorge told Geissenberg he had shunned the fatherland for eight years because of the " rotten democratic regime " of Weimar and now wished to serve the reborn Reich . Herr Geissenberg was impressed by the brilliant man and offered him a post as foreign correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung . He introduced him to Goebbels and other Nazi leaders . The Gestapo should have had a dossier on Sorge 's Communist past , but it was preoccupied with persecuting the Jews and failed to find any flaw in his faked documents which showed he had worked in China for a number of German business firms . Sorge  | was " passed " as reliable . He quickly joined the Nazi party and a few months later was off to Tokyo as an accredited German correspondent . When he next visited Germany , he was approached by one of Admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the German government with his work as the correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung . Sorge pretended to be taken aback and expressed his anxiety that not knowing anything about intelligence work he might be of little use . Admiral Canaris ' agent promised to advise and instruct him in intelligence work , and the lieutenant general of the NKVD must have had some difficulty in repressing a smile . From 1934 onward Sorge was a German agent , coming and going at the German Embassy in Tokyo , with the highest credentials . He became friendly with Lieutenant Colonel Eugen Ott , a German artillery expert with the Japanese Army , who later became military attache . They became so intimate that Ott showed Sorge the most secret reports he sent to Berlin . All this material Sorge passed on to Moscow . He also opened a small office and took as his assistant 35-year-old Ozaki Hozumi , a journalist and cousin of Prince Konoye , the Japanese prime minister . Hozumi had " progressive leanings " and by careful conditioning and development over many months , Sorge made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was promoted to ambassador and his first official step was to make his friend Sorge press attache at the German Embassy . This had obvious advantages , but meant that Sorge could no longer keep his contact with Moscow through his office . The Cheka sent a trained radio operator , Max Klausen , and Branko de Voukelitch , a correspondent of a French illustrated magazine , to act as cutouts . The spy ring was completed with a Japanese journalist , Miyagi Yotoko , who had lived in the U.S.A. since 1919 and was a secret member of the Communist Party of America . It was natural for Herr Press Attache Dr. Sorge to mix with journalists from Paris and New York , and no one suspected two of them were conveying Sorge 's material to Klausen who ,  | with the help of other Soviet agents , radioed it to Moscow using relay stations in Harbin and China . Ironically , the Nazi Nachrichtendienst paid most of Sorge 's espionage expenses for the Soviet secret service . Sorge planted on the Nazis material fabricated at the Moscow headquarters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of inside information that he was congratulated more than once by Admiral Canaris and even by Himmler and Goring . Some of Sorge 's great achievements were discovered after the occupation of Japan in 1945 . Here I can only mention one of them . When Hitler 's armies had occupied the whole of the Ukraine , reach the Crimea , and begun the siege of Moscow in the late summer of 1941 , the situation looked desperate . Stalin feared that the Japanese would at any moment invade Siberia , forcing a war on two fronts . Stalin had an army of between 400,000 and 500,000 men , well equipped and rested , guarding the Siberian frontiers . The fate of Moscow , indeed the fate of the war , depended on whether he could move these troops to the Western front . Sorge set out to discover with certainty Japan 's intentions . He realized that any mistake might destroy Russia 's chance of survival . Through his agents in the government , particularly through Prince Konoye 's cousin , Ozaki Hozumi , a young official at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two private secretaries , Ushiba Tomohiko and Kishi Michizo , Sorge secured photographic copies of cabinet minutes and of the most secret government documents . He was able to assure Moscow that the Japanese would , at least for the time being , honor the neutrality pact they had concluded with the Soviet Union in April , 1940 , and that their designs were against Britain and America , rather than against Russia . Indeed , Sorge was able to send to Moscow the plan prepared by War Minister General Tojo , which outlined the strategy of the Japanese general staff for the attack on Burma and the Philippines . It is likely that Sorge had advance knowledge of the Japanese plan for the attack on Pearl Harbor . In August , 1941 , when the German armies were nearing  | Kerch , Rostov , and Stalingrad , Sorge was again able to tell Stalin that at a secret war council attended by the Emperor , it was decided " Japanese expansion should be directed southward . " At the beginning of September he reported the withdrawal of 30 Japanese divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indonesia , and the Philippines , and stated the Siberian frontier was manned by only a few secondrate divisions . His last message to Moscow , on October 15 , after several of the members of his spy network , including Hozumi , had been arrested ? and when Sorge must have known his end was near ? concluded : " Japan is to attack America and Britain , the danger for the Soviet Union has passed . " Three days later Sorge was arrested , his unique spy ring , which had for years obtained all its information directly from government sources , was broken . Altogether 34 of his agents and informants were captured , among them many high government officials and Max Klausen , with his excellently equipped radio transmitter . But Stalin , with complete faith in Sorge , had moved his troops from the East and the beginning of the end of Hitler had started in Stalingrad . Sorge and Hozumi were finally hanged , five of the agents died in prison , others received prison sentences from three to 15 years . Of the five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only Klausen , the radio operator , survived and was freed by the Americans in October , 1945 . Eight weeks after Sorge 's arrest , the Japanese Air Force attacked Pearl Harbor , the British battleships Prince of Wales and Repulse were sunk off Singapore . Sorge was right to the last . Japan never went to war against the Soviet Union . It was Moscow who declared war on Japan the day after the Americans had dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima , 11 days before Japan surrendered . Moscow never acknowledged publicly Sorge 's unique achievements ? there are no monuments for Cheka agents . But in the Kremlin his memory is honored as that of a hero , and Stalin paid him the highest tribute when he  | said , " It was Sorge who won the battle of Stalingrad , and saved our lives ! " In Germany and Nazi-occupied Europe the Soviet secret service succeeded , for a time at least , in establishing an equally formidable spy web , whose agents were fed with information by " roast beef " ? outside brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the networks from neutral Sweden . After the war he was rewarded for his excellent work . In the building of Hitler 's former Luftwaffe Ministry in Berlin , which the Communists have rebuilt for the seat of the East German government , is a well-appointed suite , with a brass sign on its main door : " Ernst Friedrich Wollweber , Stoats-Sekretdr fur Verkehr and Schi fahrt " ( Secretary of State for Transport and Shipping ) . Behind the big desk once used by one of Giiring 's deputies , now sits a short man , with a flabby , pockmarked face and a teutonic and completely bald head . Herr Wollweber , the Secretary of State , looks like a caricature of a blustering , provincial German kaufmann . But his looks are deceptive . For 3o years he has been one of the Soviet secret service 's most brilliant spies . He learned all Hitler 's secrets except one ? the invasion of Russia in June , 1941 . Wollweber has been described as " the first violin of the Red Orchestra , " the name Rote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nazi-occupied Europe , perhaps the most effective espionage web ever organized in a war . The Red Orchestra had at its disposal 14 powerful radio transmitters in the cities of Europe . Messages were relayed every night to Moscow . About 20o agents were in the Red Orchestra , but only a handful knew of the radio stations and their positions . One of the centers was in Brussels , the network being known as the Bordo Group . It was directed by NKVD Captain Konstantin Pavlovich Yefremov , who had come to Belgium in 1939 as a student of engineering . When finally discovered by the Gestapo , it had 19 full-time agents . Also operating in Belgium and headed by two Cheka agents , Mihail Makharov and Pavel Danilov , was the Kent Group .  | A third network was the Hilda Group , with headquarters in Amsterdam , controlled by Yefremov from Brussels , but directed by Maurice Wintering , a Dutch Communist . In Paris the Gilbert Group was directed by a top agent of the Soviet secret service , whose identity has never been established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of towns in France and for three years sent information about the movement of German troops from the West to the East . The Rado Group in Geneva , and the Roessler Group in Lucerne have been mentioned . The network even extended to Portugal , where the Soviet secret service maintained a radio transmitter linked with others able to relay to Moscow . The leader of the Red Orchestra was playing the first violin in Stockholm , directing the networks by radio and couriers . His agents , who hated the Hitler regime , were ready to risk their lives . Among them were Dr. Arvid Harnack , a high official in the Nazi Ministry of Economic Affairs under Dr. Funk ; Captain Harro von Schultze-Boysen of the Luftwaffe , and Dr. Adam Kueckhoff and his wife Margarete who translated Goebbel 's speeches into English at the Nazi Propaganda Ministry . These and other intellectuals and even some Junkers insured that their information came from the highest sources . Most of the members of the Red Orchestra inside Germany were caught and executed by the Gestapo , but for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enemy territory . British and American agents also , of course , worked behind the enemy lines , and many brave men and women volunteered to be parachuted into the continent . But the point to be stressed with the Red Orchestra is that it was planned long before the outbreak of war and was complete with radio transmitters and operators even at the time when Mr. Chamberlain was still talking of peace in our time . Wollweber not only helped to direct the Red Orchestra but organized and directed a campaign of sabotage probably unequaled in war time which did more damage to the Axis war effort than a fleet of submarines . The son of a Silesian miner , Wollweber joined the German Communist Party as a youth  | when it was formed , and grew up with it . He attracted the attention of Moscow at the end of World War I when he organized mutinies in Hamburg . He reached Moscow , then cut off from Germany , in characteristic fashion . Signing on a North Sea trawler , he smuggled four comrades aboard and hid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five Communists held up the ship with pistols and forced the captain to sail to Murmansk . After training with the Cheka , Wollweber was sent back to organize a world-wide system of couriers for the Comintern , as secretary of the International Seamen 's Union . There followed years of service in different parts of the world . He became an expert in marine sabotage and is credited with the destruction or damage of 21 German , Italian , and Franco-Spanish ships carrying arms and food to the Franco forces . From 1933 he worked at Copenhagen , ostensibly as manager of A. Selvo &; Co. , Architects and Engineers , with large offices in the Vesterpoort ? only one of nine offices of the Soviet secret service in Denmark , all operating as private firms . In the war that was seen to be coming , Wollweber was assigned the task of sabotaging Germany 's sea-carried supplies . To train his men and harm the Nazis , he had one or two dress rehearsals . The catastrophe of one of the " Strength through Joy " liners , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag ship Hapag-Reliance , the sinking of Klaus Booge in Hamburg harbor , the explosions on board the Nordeney and Philas , were all the work of Wollweber 's agents . But this was only a rehearsal for Wollweber 's carefully planned campaign during the war years , for which the Cheka gave him unlimited funds . A Swedish shipping expert told me after the war that Swedish authorities estimated Wollweber and his agents and saboteurs must have spent at least ? 1,500,000 during this campaign . Wollweber had orders not to allow any Swedish ships carrying iron ore from Lulea to reach Germany from Stockholm , Malmo , or Goteborg . Sweden was neutral and regarded her supplies to Germany as quite legitimate , though they were , of course , a vital help to German war effort . When several cargo ships had been set on fire or destroyed by time bombs hidden in their  | hulls by Wollweber 's men before they left Swedish ports , the Swedish authorities pounced on Wollweber , whom they had long suspected . Moscow delivered a sharp protest in Stockholm , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . But while he was in prison , his agents delivered his reply : three modern destroyers of the Swedish Navy were blown up in the port of Stockholm . The cargo ships which Wollweber destroyed included the large vessels Vaasa , Ada Gorthon , Lilje , Gustavus Adolphus , Malmo , Galeon , and Lulea . He had wiped out a good part of the Swedish merchant fleet and Swedish insurance companies refused to give cover . To stop shipments of iron ore to Germany , Wollweber decided to attack at the source . He sent his dynamiters to the rail junction of Krylbo on Dalaly Lake in Vastmansland , northwest of Stockholm . They blew up the marshaling yards , with scores of goods trains carrying German tanks and ammunition from Norway to the Eastern front and raw materials from Norway and Denmark to Germany . So thoroughly was the sabotage carried out that the town of Krylbo was almost wholly destroyed . But Wollweber 's saboteurs did not limit their effort to Northern Europe . He planned and directed sabotage against the Italians in the Adriatic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Greek ships requisitioned by the Axis powers puzzled British naval intelligence , who knew nothing of Herr Wollweber . As well as organizing this sabotage , Wollweber had , with Captain Walter Ulbricht , worked out the organization of the Red Orchestra in Germany . Ulbricht had offices in the Danish capital in the chambers of a firm of " lawyers " in the Vimmelshaktet district , and was known under the aliases of Sorensen and Urik . Today he is the Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic , the East German Communist state . Wollweber is one of the few members of the Red Orchestra to survive both the Gestapo and the purges in Moscow , and today in Germany retains all his skill as an agent , in a different way sabotaging the Western defense efforts as effectively as he sabotaged the German ships . His position as Secretary of State  | for Transport and Shipping is only cover for his real work , which is to insure that Western Germany , controlled by Britain and America and financed by the United States , shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty and being admitted to the Western defense community . The new masters of the Ruhr industry are quite prepared to do business with Wollweber , a little surreptitiously for the time being , because of the British and American " interference , " but no less profitably . In 1950 West German industrialists sent 74,000,000 dollars ' worth of strategic materials to the Soviet zone . During the first six months of the Korean War , West German trade with Communist China alone increased by 2700 per cent . Iron and steel exports from the Ruhr during 1951 to the Soviet Union , through Herr Wollweber 's good services , amounted to $2,500,000 . In 1952 the figures almost doubled , and in 1953 ? 54 the illegal trade in strategic materials between Western Germany and the Soviet Union and China was estimated to be worth little short of $500,000,000 . By using faked invoices and false customs declarations , by bribing customs guards , or by using devious routes through Belgium and hence by sea to Polish ports , West German industrialists have shipped complete smelting and foundry plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of precision machine tools , to the East , where they have been used to equip armament factories in Poland , Russia , and China . The British and Americans have tried to stop this trade , but the Germans have always managed to get round the bans and regulations . Moscow has every reason to be satisfied with Wollweber 's postwar work . One of the few successes ever publicly claimed by the Soviet secret service was saving the life of President Roosevelt , an episode in which counterintelligence was used for political gains . When President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill arrived on December 2 , 1943 , in Teheran for their conference with Stalin , it was arranged they should stay in the embassies of their countries . Persia had been occupied by British and Soviet troops and  | there were also some United States units guarding supply routes . No sooner had Roosevelt and his aides arrived at the lofty and barely protected building of the U.S. Embassy , a mile and a half outside the Persian capital , than an excited Soviet general , accompanied by two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embassy demanding to see the President . The general handed Mr. Roosevelt a handwritten message from Stalin , which read : Dear Mr. President : There is a Hitlerite plot to do away with the three of us . This city is teeming with German undercover men . Please come and stay with me in the Soviet Embassy . With respects , yours sincerely , J. V. Stalin . After hearing the story which prompted Stalin to send this message from the Soviet officers , President Roosevelt ordered his trunks to be packed again and , with his personal staff , he moved next morning into the Soviet Embassy . This had been converted into a fortress , surrounded by barbed wire and mines , and guarded by a brigade of heavily armed MVD security troops . The dramatic move of the President was later described by the American press as " the kidnaping of the President of the United States by the Soviet Cheka . " But at the time it appeared a wise decision to avoid risks . Mr. Churchill had received a similar message from Stalin , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British secret service had rendered the main Nazi plot harmless and that the Cheka was shying at what had become a shadow . However , there was a certain danger that some of the German agents might still be at liberty and the claim that the Soviet secret service " saved Roosevelt 's life , " later made by Moscow , was not entirely without foundation . The German spy net in Turkey had somehow learned that the Allied statesmen were to meet in the Middle East . Himmler ordered a group of SS " killers " to travel to Ankara and to wait there for orders . The leaders of the group were SS Major Bert- hold Schultze and Gestapo Sturmfiihrer Willy Merz . With them were six other Gestapo men of the Sicherheits Dienst . After a stay in Turkey they were ordered to Bulgaria . A Luftwaffe bomber then took them across the Black Sea , and they parachuted near Tabriz in northern Persia . Other Nazi agents had been sent to Persia from Afghanistan , where Dr. Fritz Grobba , the German minister in Kabul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These would-be assassins reached Persia by way of Shiraz in July , and , disguised as Kurdish tribesmen , waited for the Allied statesmen . But by August the British secret service had a fairly complete list of the Nazi thugs in Persia , including some late arrivals . One of the Nazis , apparently frightened by Rommel 's defeat in Tunisia and the reverses of the German armies in the East , had contacted British agents and brought a bulky file , including a diary he had stolen from SS Major Schultze . Most of the German spies and Gestapo men were rounded up while Roosevelt and Churchill were still in Cairo meeting Chiang Kai-shek . However , the Soviet secret service had not been idle either and its agents had taken steps to frustrate the assassination plot . It is significant that the Cheka chiefs did not inform the British secret agents about these measures . Apparently on Stalin 's order , they waited until the arrival of the President of the United States and the British Prime Minister to stage the dramatic " lifesaving . " Stalin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture of friendship . Judging from the cordial atmosphere at the conferences which , on the insistence of the Soviet secret service men , were held at the Soviet Embassy building , he was right . Stalin obtained almost every political and military concession he hoped for from the American government . This may , therefore , be credited as a considerable triumph of the Soviet secret service and illustrates the fact that with Communism everything is looked at from the point of view of political advantage . In contrast to these great successes we may take a case in which Moscow completely failed for many years to detect an agent planted in the Cheka .   In the winter of 1932 a Cheka agent was in front of the Polish Embassy in Moscow , engaged in shadowing diplomats , a routine job for the Cheka . When the second secretary of the embassy left the building , the agent followed him without much enthusiam . The Pole strolled through many streets , made a few purchases in various shops , and finally entered a cafe , where he took some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until he stopped at a newspaper kiosk . The interest of the Cheka agent was suddenly awakened when he noticed that the Polish diplomat bumped into another man . Both politely raised their hats and exchanged apologies , but the Cheka agent thought they had spoken more than necessary to beg each other 's pardon . He intelligently decided to follow the stranger rather than the Polish diplomat . The stranger behaved suspiciously . He walked for a while , then boarded a streetcar and alighted at the Kazankiy Railway Station . He went into a waiting room , strolled along the platforms . Apparently satisfied that he was not being followed , he left the station , walked some distance , took a streetcar across the center of Moscow to Twerskaya Street . Finally , after more zigzag walking , he entered the Hotel Lux , then used by the Comintern as the official guest house for distinguished foreign Communists and agents . The agent asked the doorman , who was also a Cheka man , the name of the man who had just entered . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " That 's comrade Sochatzki , a big noise of the Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party and a friend of Menzhinsky and Triliser . " The agent was in doubt whether he should report his observation , since it was dangerous to meddle in the affairs of the great , but he finally decided he must do his duty . His report was brought by the chief of the internal supervision department to Triliser , one of Menzhinsky 's deputies , just as a " routine inquiry . " Triliser was amused . " What , my friend Sochatzki observed in surreptitious conversations with a Polish diplomat ? Well , if Sochatzki is a spy , then I am one tool " he exclaimed .  | But he had second thoughts . Why had Sochatzki , a trained and experienced Cheka agent for many years , acted so strangely , why did he walk the streets , why had he made all the detours ? This was the normal technique for shaking off a possible shadower . Triliser decided the matter must be brought before Menzhinsky and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comintern departments dealing with foreign Communists . Sochatzki was given an assignment outside Moscow , and in his absence his rooms at the Hotel Lux were thoroughly searched . But nothing compromising was found . Then a trap was laid . Menzhinsky called the Pole to his office and told him excitedly that the Polish secret police had discovered the identity of one of the Cheka top agents in Warsaw and that the man was in dire danger . He told Sochatzki that the code name of this agent was " Wojtek " and asked him for advice . The whole story was made up , the name of the nonexistent agent fictitious . But a few days later Menzhinsky received a message from the Cheka 's network in Warsaw that the Polish secret police were looking everywhere for a Soviet agent called Wojtek . There was only one explanation . Apart from Menzhinsky , Sochatzki alone knew the fictitious name . It was clear that he was a spy of the Polish government and that he had reported Menzhinsky 's disclosure to Warsaw . But the Cheka was still not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for weeks . They discovered that he had regular meetings with contact men of the Polish Embassy . Slowly the grim truth was apparent that the famous Polish Communist was an agent provocateur which the Polish government had planted in the heart of the Cheka . The discovery caused panic in the Cheka headquarters and was one of the reasons why later its Polish bosses , Menzhinsky , Triliser , and Unshlikht , as well as many other high officials and department chiefs of Polish origin , were ousted and why Stalin sent Yagoda to take over . Many of them perished in the great purges of 1936 and 1937 , unable to completely exonerate themselves from the Sochatzki case . The case had fantastic features . Sochatzki had joined the  | Polish Communist Party in 1921 , coming from the PPS , the Polish Socialist Party , of which Josef Pilsudski was one of the leaders . After the Polish-Soviet War in 1920 , when the Poles suffered humiliating defeats , Pilsudski ordered Sochatzki to become a Communist and to try and join the Cheka . Sochatzki played his part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most trusted men of Moscow . Although all the time a spy of the Polish general staff and the secret police , he was ostentatiously arrested and imprisoned several times as a leader of the underground movement of the Polish Communists , after the party had been outlawed by Pilsudski . He supplied all the secret decisions , which he often himself proposed , to the Polish authorities and delivered scores of his comrades to the police . Finally , he was called to Moscow because his life seemed to be in danger in Warsaw , and became one of the top agents of the Cheka . For ten years until he was unmasked in 1932 , through the vigilance of a little Cheka shadower , he had access to most of the secrets of the Soviet secret service . Another , if less spectacular , failure concerned the head of the British section of the Comintern in the late thirties , the Cheka agent Petrovsky , who for his visits as an inspector to London used the alias of " Bennet . " Petrovsky joined the Cheka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Yagoda and the other Cheka chiefs . He had come from the Ukraine , where he appeared to have fought during the civil war again the White Army of the Cossack leader Petlyura . It took 15 years for the Cheka bosses to discover that Petrovsky had been not the adversary of Petlyura but the chief of his department in Kiev which dealt with captured Bolshevik leaders . Petrovsky in 1918 and 1919 had been responsible for the hanging of scores of captured Bolshevik officials and Red Army leaders . When Petlyura was finally defeated and fled first to Berlin and later to Paris , Petrovsky went into hiding for a time , but later appeared in Moscow , with cleverly forged papers showing that he had been a revolutionary fighter in the Ukraine . He did not even trouble to change his name , was accepted as a genuine  | Communist , and made an official of the Soviet secret service , gaining rapid promotion until he was assigned to the control of the British espionage networks . When his antecedents were discovered he suffered the same fate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lubianka . In contrast to failures of this magnitude , the periodical detection of a Soviet agent in a comparatively minor act of espionage which makes headlines is , in fact , of small importance . It would be a great mistake to underestimate the skill and efficiency of the Soviet secret service because of the occasional choking of the bureaucratic machine or the clumsiness of agents . Examples of failure through sheer clumsiness were afforded recently by Major Ivan Pupyshev and Major Andrew Gudkov , the two assistant military attaches at the Soviet Embassy in London early in 1954 . On May 7 the Soviet ambassador was called to the Foreign Office and informed that the two attaches had abused their diplomatic status by engaging in espionage in the United Kingdom and were consequently no longer personae gratae . Major Gudkov had apparently been given the target of obtaining designs of four British military aircraft of the latest type . Short of straightforward burglary of the aircraft factory concerned , which was out of the question , his only possibility was to discover some British employee with access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this case the Index apparently failed to reveal anyone . Major Gudkov therefore decided to approach the problem through a Communist contact man employed at the factory in a position where he had no access to secret information . The contact man was told to find one of the workers in the drawing office and suggest a meeting at which he would hear of something to his advantage . This meeting eventually took place at a public house nearby . Exactly what passed is , of course , impossible to say , but Major Gudkov apparently offered a substantial sum of money , believed to be ? 600 , for copies of certain drawings . He seems to have thrown caution to the winds and jumped to the conclusion that agreement to meet him again meant the offer was  | being accepted . In fact , as an intelligent agent might have suspected , it meant he would be under observation . The worker went to the police and , at the next meeting , detectives of the Special Branch and M.I.5 officers were watching in the public house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was introduced to Major Gudkov as another worker in the factory , and for nearly six months these meetings took place in public houses and cafes , always with M.I.5 watching , unknown to the major . Gudkov was given some meaningless drawings , for which he gladly paid , and the farce continued until the time came when the major was confronted red-handed and told that he had been making a fool of himself for months ? only his diplomatic status protected him from arrest . Major Pupyshev , working independently on a similar assignment , approached an R.A.F. officer with a proposal to sell him certain information relating to jet aircraft ? he had apparently met the officer when receiving hospitality at the Farnborough aircraft display . The officer reported immediately to his superiors and from then on acted on the advice of security officials , meeting Pupyshev until counterintelligence felt they had all the information they were likely to get about the agent . It is difficult to believe that agents making such clumsy mistakes could belong to the same service as Richard Sorge , but it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the point of view of the Soviet secret service , the exposure was of little importance ? no " networks " were uncovered and the diplomatic expulsion of a couple of attaches who could be easily replaced caused no great excitement in Moscow . This case was the subject of a good deal of mockery in the popular press , but the lesson to be learned is rather that this crude technique was used not so much out of ignorance as because it had succeeded many times before , at any rate in other countries . The failure was due to overconfidence which was at the bottom of another failure in Britain . In July , 1952 , a 24-year-old clerk in the British Foreign Office , William Martin Marshall , was sent to prison for five years for an offense under the Official Secrets Act , and Pavel Kuznet- zov , third secretary of the Soviet Embassy in London , was declared persona non grata and recalled to Moscow . Marshall was sent in i 950 to work in the cipher department of the British Embassy in Moscow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish friendly relations with Russian people although he was interested in them . Someone suggested ? and however " innocent " Marshall may have been , we may suspect the suggestion was made on orders from the Cheka ? that when he returned to London he might get in touch with Kuznetzov at the embassy , who would discuss life in Russia and " cultural " matters with him . He was given a letter , and this he presented to Kuznetzov at the London embassy on his return from Moscow early in 1952 . He had a friendly reception and there were discussions over expensive dinners in Mayfair about Russian life and culture and sometimes politics but , according to Marshall , only with reference to Germany and the war in Korea . Kuznetzov may have suspected that Marshall had been " planted " by the British counterintelligence , but apparently after a time was satisfied , and the meetings became less formal and more clandestine . The two men met at Richmond Park and King George 's Park in Wandsworth . Kuznetzov , of course , was aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work may well handle the same confidential information as the highest official , and possibly the apparent simplicity of everything made him overconfident . He overlooked the possibility that British counterintelligence knew he was a secret service agent rather than a diplomat and would be interested in his movements and telephone conversations . He was caught red-handed at one of the park meetings . Kuznetzov showed his diplomatic credentials and was allowed to go free , but his dupe was found , according to the solicitor general at his trial , with a copy of a Foreign Office document containing highly secret information in his wallet . In this case the failure was probably the result of Kuznetzov ignoring the general principles and techniques used by Soviet secret service agents when dealing with dupes or innocents .  | I quote these minor instances of failure only to emphasize the danger of considering them important in the grand scale of Soviet espionage . The Cheka works on the principle that a big net must catch some fish and it would be a mistake to assume , as some experts appear to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , Petrov in Australia is typical . It is , after all , only the failures we hear about . The successes , like Sorge , are unknown until years later , and then perhaps only by accident . Looking back over nearly four decades of Soviet secret service work , it is possible to conclude that the really disastrous failures have been concerned not with obtaining information but in interpreting it . I hope this book has made clear the extraordinary and generally consistent success of the Soviet secret service in getting information ? if it was not obtained in one way , it was obtained in another . But facts , however secret in themselves , are only half the story . The correct interpretation of them to decide on policy and action is equally important . The Russians have been less successful in interpretation than in espionage . The reasons for this are too complex to discuss here , but basically are due to the rigidity of the Marxist training and to lack of understanding of the character and way of life of peoples outside the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the belief that the attack on Finland would be a pushover and the refusal to believe that the Germans would invade in 1941 . In both cases the Soviet secret service had supplied the essential facts ? in the case of Hitler 's invasion they had also been supplied by the British intelligence . But these facts were wrongly interpreted because of prejudice . Stalin insisted , for instance , that the British evidence and warning of Hitler 's intention to invade Moscow in June , 1941 , given by Sir Anthony Eden as early as March or April , 1941 , was designed to trap Russia into precipitate action that would ease Britain 's own situation . The result was that the German attack caught the Russians unprepared , and this mistake alone cost millions of lives .  | There is , unfortunately , little consolation to be derived from this weakness in interpretation at the highest level , since it always carries the danger of precipitate action as a result of unjustified fears .  | The account I have given of its organization , methods , and activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet secret service is a formidable force , unique in the history of civilization both in its technique and its size . Many of the facts have been known for two decades or longer . Yet the greatest single asset of the Soviet secret service in the last 30 years has been the refusal of the ordinary citizens of democratic countries to face the facts about it . Many books have been written by men who actually served the Cheka , but their disclosures appeared unreal to readers in the English-speaking countries . The " confessions " of these converts ? who admitted of having been Chekists or at least militant Communists for many years ? were met , perhaps understandably , with caution and sometimes with doubt or even contempt . The Soviet secret service has also at times been greatly helped by the desire of governments and influential people to hush up matters for the sake of international good will , political expediency , or tolerance . The methods of the Cheka can not survive in the light of day . They breed and flourish in secrecy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure hampers the So- viet secret service , and trials and inquiries such as those conducted in Canada and Australia serve purposes beyond those of justice . In contrast , sensational denunciations , built up precariously on uncorroborated or doubtful evidence , only assist Moscow to discredit the hotheaded accusers and to create confusion among the citizens of democratic countries . Indeed , I am convinced that the self-advertised Communist-bailers in the United States , whose personal conduct does not inspire particular trust , have caused greater damage to the defenses against the Soviet secret service attack than we can assess at present . They have probably driven thousands of people into " neutralism , " or even made them into " sympathizers " with Communism , because to them the witch-hunters ' methods and behavior were as repulsive as those of the adversary against whom the " crusade " was mounted . One would , of course , expect high moral obligation , unbought candor , and integrity from crusaders against " Communist savages , " but just these qualities were often lacking and caused these " crusades " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relate the facts rather than to suggest policies or tactics by which the attack of the Soviet secret service can be blunted . On the one hand , this is a matter of politics , bound up with the whole problem of dealing with Communism or , more correctly , with Stalinism . On the other , it involves consideration of detailed security techniques . But any account of the organization and methods of the Soviet secret service would be incomplete without some suggestions of the ways in which it might be countered , bearing in mind the overriding obligation of democracies , in contrast to Communist regimes , that they can not make the end the justification of the means . To attempt defense by using the methods of the Cheka would be to lose the battle before it was joined . As I hope this account has made clear , the Soviet secret service relies on the systematic and often cynical use of innocents and dupes . Without hundreds of thousands of amateurs who work for it because they have been induced in one way or another to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own country and even their own friends and relatives , the professionals of the Soviet secret service would be relatively ineffective . A certain number of the traitors know exactly what ' , they are doing and understand and approve of the methods of their masters . But many , even after betrayals , remain comparatively innocent . They are bewildered to find what they have let themselves in for , and not all the excuses offered by defense counsel at spy trials involving traitors can be dismissed as mere efforts to secure mitigation of sentence . Spreading knowledge of the methods and work of the Soviet secret service should , therefore , receive first place in our defense . When the revelations of a Petrov or a Khokhlov no longer come as a " surprise " and we accept that the purpose of the Soviet secret service is to build up fifth columns or blackmail citizens into espionage in our own and every other country in as matter-of-fact a way as we accept the fact that the Soviet Union is building tanks or assembling atom bombs , then we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts , as related in this book , will make it not only more difficult for Soviet agents and native Communists to recruit informers , but will also insure that the spies and traitors will be exposed earlier in their careers than heretofore . This is , of course , a long-term view and in the meantime the great damage that is being inflicted by the Soviet secret service has to be limited by constant vigilance on the part of the authorities . It must be obvious to readers of this book that the counterintelligence of the democracies has for years been lamentably ineffectual . At any rate until the exposure of the atomic traitors , there appeared to be little appreciation of the principles , purposes , and methods of Soviet espionage . There was a complete failure to adapt security and counterintelligence techniques to new problems presented by the periodical reorganizations and expansions of the Soviet secret service . The counterintelligence organizations were often hampered , too , by politics ? both party and international ? so that even notorious Soviet agents , like Eisler , repeatedly outwitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterintelligence organizations , they  | were only too liable to be disheartened by the lack of purpose and will of those who controlled them . Even the series of shocks administered by the trials of the atomic spies , the startling disclosures in the United States , or the disappearance of Professor Pontecorvo , and the " missing British diplomats , " did not immediately have the necessary salutary effect . If only a fraction of the allegations disclosed at the many hearings of the U. S. Senate committees were true ? particularly if it was correct that high officials of the U. S. administration were Soviet agents ? then those in control of the U. S. counterintelligence must have been guilty of staggering dereliction of duty . There was a tendency on the part of some authorities to whitewash the security organizations , while the press and the public tended to concentrate on the psychology of treachery rather than on its mechanics . Millions of words have been written explaining and analyzing the motives of Fuchs . It is a fascinating subject , but there is the danger of concentrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extent that the detection of their deeds comes to seem unimportant . For instance , hundreds of thousands of ordinary , decent people who were certainly not Communists were ready to sign petitions on behalf of the Rosenbergs , because their personal fate appeared tragic and aroused compassion . But how many gave a thought , not vindictively but objectively , to what the Rosenbergs had done and to how they were able to remain undetected for so many years ? The official position is now changing . In Britain a new section in the Special Branch of Scotland Yard has been established to compile dossiers of those men and women who are known or suspected of being engaged in espionage . The work was started , perhaps a little late , at the end of 1951 , when the Special Branch entrusted a comprehensive check-up to a group of ten police officers led by Chief Inspector Wade . This check-up almost immediately produced good results . I am not giving away any secret when I say that the Directors in Moscow would have an unpleasant surprise if they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in   Britain . In 1952 , within a few months of the check-up , ten aliens were deported from Britain . The figures of deportations in 1953 and 1954 were very much higher . Immigration authorities , too , prevented a considerable number of suspects from entering Britain . And although the policy of the British government not to prosecute every person suspected of espionage still holds good , a roundup could be carried out , if necessary , in a matter of hours . In the United States the new security drive took more dramatic forms and led to many arrests of leading Communists , who were charged with conspiring to overthrow the government . Anyone even remotely suspected of sympathy with the Soviet Union was in danger of being apprehended , and some measures appeared to be rather exaggerated , caused much crit-icism , and created widespread fear of endless " witch hunts . " Far from being a remedy , such witch hunts , by promoting discord inside a country and producing distrust among its allies and friends , only mean another victory for the Soviet secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of insecurity and suspicion created inside the United States by the followup of the exposures of Soviet espionage and subversive activities may be judged to have been more damaging than the information gained by the Soviet agents about the atomic bomb . The outlawing of a national Communist Party has always proved of doubtful value . Espionage is , in any case , carried out secretly , and fronts enable recruiting to continue . Nazi Germany outlawed Communism more effectively than any other country by actions that no democracy could tolerate . But the Gestapo , in spite of its concentration camps and mass executions , could not prevent the Soviet secret service from having its agents in key positions when war came , as I have described . At the same time it is obvious that state secrets must be kept from those who may betray them . The word " screening " is now used to describe the process of preventing potential traitors from having access to places and information that might be considered targets for foreign agents . The present-day battle of  | ideologies has probably resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount and range of sensitive technical , military , and political information mean that screening has to be applied to an ever-growing number of persons . Each discovery that agents or traitors have slipped through the screen must result in the mesh becoming smaller and smaller . Screening is thus becoming so elaborate that there is some danger of its defeating its own object . It was stated , for instance , that after intensified screening of men engaged in atomic production had been ordered , only 2000 had been interviewed after two years . A considerable number of personnel remained unscreened , while those screened by the end of the two-year period had ample time to commit every felony of which they might have been suspected at the beginning of the campaign . On October 9 , 1954 , the British government announced that another 7000 civil servants are to be " investigated by a special security procedure as to their reliability in employment on exceptionally secret work . " The announcement added that " the estimate that outside the atomic energy field not more than 3000 posts would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that further posts would have to be included . " The new official estimate is that about io , 000 posts will be subject to the screening procedure . We may wonder whether screening has not become too much of a routine matter of dates , places , and biographical items , and whether , in this age of ideological conflict , it should not be more imaginative and designed to discover a man 's mental stability as well as his past . If potential or actual ideological traitors are to be detected , something more subtle than the usual routine will have to be applied . The screening of Professor Pontecorvo was described as " particularly satisfactory , " but did not discover his Communist associations . 1 ) r . Otto John had been recommended by the allied counterintelligence organizations as the ideal man to head the Intelligence Office of the West German Federal Republic ? only after the damage was done was it stated that he was " mentally unstable and given to drink . "  | Counterintelligence in the West has generally been in the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the problem of detecting and preventing subversion may now have become too subtle for them . The days when they could " spot a Red a mile off " are gone , and counterintelligence might well seek the aid of men in other walks of life , especially psychologists trained in assessing mental stability . Some beginnings have been made in this direction , particularly in the United States , and may produce good results . Some of the failures of British and American counterintelligence during the war insofar as the Soviet secret service was concerned , could be attributed to lack of coordination between the various intelligence agencies inside each country and between the two countries . Internally the position now appears to have been improved ? in the United States by the setting up of the Central Intelligence Agency , and in Britain by a closer cooperation of the various security organizations . But continued recrimination between the two nations about their failures suggests that there is scope for improvement in their mutual relations in the sphere of political and military intelligence . Neither intelligence organization has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preach sermons to the other . The real answer to the Soviet secret service is not so much the unmasking of spies ? which remains a police matter ? as the prevention of potential spies from having access to important information . In carrying out this task , injustice may sometimes be done in that men and women of integrity are unnecessarily barred from sensitive positions . But this price we must be prepared to pay . After all , we do not hesitate in refusing a motor driving licence to a person who is liable to have an accident because of some physical or mental disability , although in fact he might be quite capable of overcoming the handicap . The recruiting methods of the Soviet secret service make it necessary to bar completely innocent persons from employment where security risks are involved when there is a well-founded reason to assume that they would be obvious targets for recruitment by Soviet agents . Thus while it may not be an offense  | to be a Communist , it may be necessary to bar the wife of a Communist from such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pressure or blackmail . While genuinely liberal people are rightly concerned to preserve freedom and to avoid witch hunts , we must not play into the hands of an adversary . The plea of being persecuted , like the plea of being an ardent patriot , can be the last refuge of a scoundrel . The problems posed by such methods as screening , witchhunting , and purging will continue to arouse controversy and will need subtle and thoughtful handling . But there can hardly be any controversy about the suggestion that if the democracies are to counter the attack by the Soviet secret service effectively , they must be prepared to spend very much more money and energy on counterintelligence . Compared with the size of the Cheka , even the present expanded counterintelligence forces of the West are ludicrously inadequate . Quantity is , of course , not everything , but it does count . A certain minimum of manpower is required , and this minimum number is far above anything that , for instance , Great Britain has ever used . Relentless surveillance is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scientists whom Yakovlev never met because he could never shake off the shadows , or the Polish agent caught at last in Moscow because he was followed as a matter of routine . No one from the West who has passed through the Iron Curtain , from ambassador to businessman or journalist , has ever been left unwatched . I do not suggest that surveillance on this scale is necessary or desirable in the West . But the resources of the counterintelligence agencies should be such that shortage of manpower or shortage of money need never prevent them from leaving such persons as interest them unobserved . We still think of our own secret services as auxiliaries of the fighting services rather than as a fourth arm in their own right . Such an attitude can result in io , 000,000 being spent on an aircraft carrier that may be sunk in its first battle because half that sum was begrudged for all counterintelligence for a whole year . In every field first-class intelligence is an economy . Reluctance to spend has cost thousands of times   the sum saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on men . The Soviet secret service spends millions a year in paying for information or in distributing bribes . Distasteful as it may be , the West must be prepared to match banknote with banknote , as it matches army division with army division . There is evidence that during the war great opportunities were lost because the official attitude was that while ? 500,000 was a trifle to spend on a weapon , ? 500 was a large sum to spend on buying information . It may be taken for granted that the systematic abuse of dip-lomatic privileges and the use of " cultural " organizations and trade delegations for espionage and subversion by the Soviet Union will continue . From the time that diplomatic missions were first received by Bolshevik Russia , every member from the ambassador down to the humblest clerk was treated in Moscow as if his real purpose was espionage . The inclination in the West was to treat this as xenophobia , spy mania , or merely something to laugh at . The simple deduction that foreign diplomats in Moscow were treated as spies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved much damage . The West had to adjust itself to the association of diplomacy and espionage , not by discouraging diplomatic relations , but by insuring they are confined to diplomacy . Members of the Western defense community took a step in this direction when they insisted that Iron Curtain diplomats should be subjected to the same restriction on their movements as their own diplomats in Moscow . It may prove necessary to have the same surveillance , not merely of diplomats , but of all the officials that experience has shown are used for espionage . Surveillance can not stop all espionage , but it makes it more difficult , especially the establishing of contact with native informers . But surveillance is extremely expensive in manpower . There are some 4100 diplomats from 26 countries in London and obviously it would be impossible to watch the goings and comings of all of them . But given the necessary manpower it should not be impossible to keep an eye on the 200 or so from behind the Iron Curtain .  | As I have shown by many examples , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to further espionage . If we believe , as we must , that the greatest hope of diverting the Russians from their set course is to give them every opportunity of seeing and understanding the democratic way of life , then to cut off these contacts would be foolish . The decisive factor in many defections may be fear and unwillingness to return home or the fear of being purged ? some of the recent converts , for instance , admitted to having been Beria men ? rather than any admiration of the democratic way of life or a sudden falling-out with Communist ideas . But there can be no doubt that a certain number of defections were genuinely due to preference for democratic ideology and our way of life . At the same time we have to remain aware that every man who comes through the Iron Curtain , whether as a Soviet diplomat or a visitor , has been carefully " vetted " by the Cheka , and that he may be a secret agent who regards accepting hospitality as no barrier to preparing the discomfiture of his host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics are something apart and it is difficult for him to grasp that for a Communist everything , whether it is a film show or a cocktail party , a rent strike or a peace petition , is a means to an end , a political means to be used for a political purpose . Wider understanding of this will provide a strong weapon against the activities of the Soviet secret service , because it will deprive its agents of a means of infiltration . In the English-speaking democracies the Communist parties have been so discredited politically that they now make only the feeblest efforts to get parliamentary representation , and concentrate on infiltrating trade unions , cultural societies , and social clubs . Time and the cooperation of the public will result in their being equally discredited in these activities , with a consequent shrinking of the opportunities for subversion . In spite of the almost unbroken success story of the Soviet secret service recorded in this book , and the evidence of its great power , it would be a mistake to paint a picture of unrelieved gloom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent years , show that in spite of the careful selection , training , and conditioning of its agents , the Soviet secret service is vulnerable . Each trial or inquiry discredits its methods and also its fifth-column helpers within the Communist parties , and serves as a lesson to those among us who still remain gullible . Nor should we assume that all the successes have been one way . It would be unwise to publicize those which have been won by the Western intelligence organizations . But it may be as well to record a statement , made not so long ago by a high-ranking Cheka agent , who had come over to the West , Lieutenant Col. ' onel of the MVD , Burtlitsky , who stated : I believe that agents of the Western intelligence have penetrated the government , the army , and the Communist organizations of the Soviet Union , and probably on the highest levels . We were taught at a Moscow college for MVD officers that British intelligence is particularly experienced and effective
