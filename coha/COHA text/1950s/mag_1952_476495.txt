IT Is embarrassing to admit , for it was not at all a customary family greeting , but I distinctly remember saying , " Hi , Toots , " when my wife leaned over the hospital bed as I regained consciousness . I did n't know the doctors were hidden behind the head of the bed to see if I could speak at all . They had not expected me to live and had told my wife that if I did , the chances were that I would neither move nor speak again . But that morning , as they drilled two small holes in the back of my head for an X-ray study , the drill , quite by accident , punctured a brain abscess , and consciousness returned . That was the beginning of six hard-months of intensive work , just to regain elementary skills that most of us take for granted . My right vision was blank , my hands would not co-ordinate to use a knife and fork , and it was impossible to read or write . Numbers on telephone dials baffled me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems in arithmetic or use the typewriter which had been my companion for years . Such handicaps were so intolerable that I became obsessed with a grim determination to overcome them somehow , no matter how great the effort . The doctors told me that my faculties would return , but that I would have to work at it . They did return , but the way was long and hard , and without guide posts anywhere . In January of 1949 I was a regular army colonel , fifty-two years old , in excellent health , and in command of an army post on the island of Eta Jima in Japan . Near the end of May a series of severe headaches , chills , fever , and spells of dizziness led to my evacuation by air to Walter Reed General Hospital in Washington , D. C. Because of a mistake in the initial diagnosis , the streptococcic infection that caused my illness progressed without treatment for twenty-three days . Before leaving Japan my right vision had become blank , and during the trip two large abscesses developed and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , I was in such bad condition that an accurate diagnosis was impossible . I wavered between excruciating headaches and unconsciousness , and when the doctors asked me how I felt , my stock answer was , " Fine . " It exasperated them because they had to learn my true condition from my wife , who had accompanied me throughout the evacuation flight . I did not expect to die , but she told me later I was depressed because my military career seemed ended . In spite of her best efforts to keep him from alarming me , a chaplain came to my room during one of my few lucid moments . He grasped my hand and told me to be brave in meeting my Maker . When I told my wife about the " sky pilot 's " visit she was furious . But I said , " It does n't matter . I humored him , for he was doing his duty as he saw it . " The next day , when the drill punctured the brain abscess , my headaches stopped . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluid from my brain to examine it , I was amazed , for I did n't know they had drilled the holes . For a few hours afterward , when I moved my head , it sounded like an empty watermelon , but I could n't feel it , for there is no sensation in the brain itself . Large quantities of penicillin and other drugs killed the infection , and ten days later Dr. Hugo V. Rizzoli performed a long and delicate operation which removed the capsulated abscess from my brain . WITHIN a week I was able to sit up and look at the world around me , but it was not the clear , sharp world that I had known . It was a frustrating place , hazy and dreamlike , with unexpected pitfalls and stumbling blocks everywhere . Doctors came frequently to my room , asked my name and where I was . T knew my name , but told them I was in Tokyo . From their reactions I sensed that something was wrong , but I did n't know what it was . They wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tried to jot them down and memorize them , but would lose my notes , and when I found them later I could n't read them . My wife brought a diary for recording names and events . The first entry , several days after the operation , read , " Sat ypin claim , " and four days later , " mi coldar pain in highs . " I had attempted to write : " Sat up in chair , " and , " Muscular pain in thighs . " Even greater confusion came from vision . The doctors told me frankly that my right vision would not return , yet with my left eye closed , I knew that I could see a little with the right one . But what I saw did n't make sense . When I looked squarely at someone a few feet away only half his face would look back at me . The other half would just not be there . It took several weeks for me to learn that " right vision " means the right half of the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw only the left half of whatever my eyes focused upon . To understand the difficulty was of great help later on , but in the meantime many problems in daily living had to be solved . At mealtimes the ward man placed a tray so that I could sit on the edge of the bed to eat . The simple operation of cutting a piece MAGAZINE of meat required intense concentration . My right hand , which had been paralyzed before the operation , was very weak . To use it 1 had to turn my head , adjust my field of view to include both knife and fork , and use my eyes to co-ordinate the action of both hands . When I did n't keep my right hand in view it would knock over a glass of milk , or come to rest in a bowl of hot soup . After the meal , when I wanted to light a cigarette , the lighter and the cigarette would seek each other in vain . These problems raised a question for immediate decision . Although I had used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which hand should I use ? With my right hand weak , and my right vision blank , perhaps it would be easier to use the left hand ; but on the other hand , if I forced the use of my right hand , maybe it would strengthen my ability to do so . I decided the harder way would produce better results in the long run . I used the right hand . That first decision started a chain of events that led to my recovery . I asked my wife to bring something to represent Chinese walnuts . We had learned in China how people there gain strength and suppleness in their fingers by rolling two old walnuts in one hand without allowing them to touch each other . I practiced daily with two golf balls , rolling them in one hand , and frequently passing them from one hand to the other for co-ordination . A few weeks later a young surgeon , who had insisted that my right vision would not return , saw me light a cigarette . He stared and asked , " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't explain , because the use of my right hand had again become an unconscious act . But in the meantime , and before any success followed my effort , new pitfalls presented themselves . My physical condition improved steadily , and nine days after the operation the doctor suggested a trip outdoors in a wheel chair . My own motion , and the movements of people and vehicles along the way , threw me into complete confusion . Lawns and trees were meaningless blotches of green . I saw trunks of trees and patches of foliage , but could n't tell which were close and which were far away . There was nothing on which to fix a conscious fear , yet I was terrified . I could not tell where the hospital was , how far away , nor in which direction . Actually , we COMEBACK FROM A had not gone over three hundred feet , and had turned only two corners , but I was lost and bewildered in patterns of color and movement my mind could neither analyze nor accept . When people or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked again they would seem to have disappeared , and I could not find them . Everything moved too fast for me to follow with my eyes . I was glad to get back to the security of my room , and reluctant to go outdoors again . That first trip into the outer world caused more mental anguish than any other phase of my illness . Two weeks after the operation the doctors stopped administering the huge quantities of drugs . Nurses no longer awakened me every two hours for penicillin injections , I began visiting clinics for tests and X-rays , and one of the surgeons invited my wife and me to dinner at the officers ' club . This created new problems ? to dress completely for the first time since my illness , and to find my way about . In the small hospital room , when I wanted to hang up a coat , I made false starts toward several pieces of furniture before finding the single wall locker . It made me furiously angry that more often than not I got my underwear on backwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clinic my upset vision gave me the choice between avoiding collisions in the hallways or finding the clinic , hut I could n't do both at the same time . When I concentrated , on the moving traffic of people , litters , and pushcarts , I would miss corners and the signs on doorways ; and when I concentrated on the route and the signs , I would suffer all kinds of disaster along the way , bump into people , trip over the extension cords of waxing machines , and be sideswiped by passing equipment . To ask directions was of little help , for north and south , and left and right , had a strange way of registering by opposites in my mind . The frequent recurrence of such experiences made me uncomfortable about being with other people , for I was all too conscious of these idiosyncrasies , yet powerless to master them . II 0 NE day I tried to write a letter , but the result was shockingly illegible . My thoughts seemed clear enough , but somehow the wrong letters appeared on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word , my hand felt paralyzed , the pencil made meaningless jagged marks , and then visualization of the word became impossible . Writing was slow and laborious , and impatience only increased the difficulty . Alarmed , I asked the doctors about it , and it was then that they said my abilities would return , but that I would have to work to help restore them . The doctors offered no advice as to how to proceed . They could bring about my physical recovery , but in the complicated fields of motivation , mentality , and skills , it was up to me . To be unable to write rapidly and freely was intolerable , so I started methodical practice . Several times a clay I wrote and printed the alphabet , and the familiar sentence with all the letters : " The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog . " The work was hard and tiring , and I had to rest between practice periods . When I practiced too long at a time errors increased , and I became frustrated and discouraged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first , but on the fourth day I completed the exercise once without error . Encouraged , I continued to practice alphabets but added an exercise which required composing sentences as I wrote them . That was more difficult than writing memorized sentences , for When my thoughts were on the sense of a statement , instead of on the letters my hand was forming ; many errors crept in . Perhaps the difficulty of co-ordinating mind , hand , and narrowed vision would have discouraged me completely if I had not corrected and scored my daily work . The scores gave conclusive proof that my work was improving , in spite of the inner feeling that it was not . In addition , the papers enabled me to pinpoint recurrent errors . I discovered that many of them followed a consistent pattern . Somehow my hand avoided letters with loops below the line , and readily substituted " b 's " for " p 's " and " I 's . " I discovered that these same letters caused the feeling of paralysis when I tried to write them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks I knew which letters troubled me the most , and from then on confined my practice to writing tongue twisters which contained them . Once I had mastered such sentences as : 72 , HARPER 'S MAGAZINE " Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer is the perfect beer for the berry picker 's prefecture , " I was satisfied that I had recovered the ability to write . By the end of six weeks my handwriting had resumed its normal appearance . Although I had succeeded in my efforts to regain manual dexterity and ability to write , an increasing list of disquieting handicaps faced me . After a month of recuperation my physical condition had improved to the point where I could get around quite readily , swim in the pool , and visit stores near the hospital . But as I became more active , I found new disabilities . I could not read newspapers or magazines . Even when I wrote a telephone number on a piece of paper and held it before me , I could not dial it correctly . I remembered mathematical formulas and felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dream was shattered one day when a doctor asked me , " What is a thousand less seven ? " My mind went into complete confusion as zeros , nines , and threes chased each other around in space without falling in line with an answer . At the end of the first month I tried to typewrite and produced such garbled results that I postponed further effort on it . Names and dates continued to escape from memory within a few moments after hearing them . If I wrote three letters on the same day I had to look up the date three times . One day I went shopping and bought a sport coat , but when I took out my check book I realized I did n't know how to write a check . After intense study and concentration , and three attempts , I finally got the words and figures in the right places . T HERE was hardly a moment in the day without its reminder of some incapac- ity . Although I was free to go where I pleased , when I moved around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its pleasure . Restricted vision and " head consciousness " following the operation on my skull bothered me when I got in and out of vehicles ; and the difficulty of merging and focusing my eyes on people and vehicles in busy streets made me dizzy and exhausted after a very few minutes . My judgment of distances was not good , and after many years of driving without accident , I felt unsure while crossing an ordinary street on foot . Two months earlier I had been overflowing with quick energy . Every day had been a round of meeting people , supervising training , leadirg conferences , making decisions , and handling the many activities that fill the life of a commander of a large military establishment . There had been no time to think of myself . But now , although I had recovered physically from my illness , each day was filled with personal problems that were part of an intense struggle to bring back the ability to do things which formerly were spontaneous and required no thought at all . Underlying all the problems was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the element that I could not accept . My sense of pride in personal efficiency , and my professional record at West Point and in the Army , would not tolerate a collapse of the abilities I had acquired over the years . I wanted to return to active military duty , and I was determined that somehow I would . As an instructor in horsemanship in my earlier army days , I learned the principle that when a man falls off his horse it is of utmost importance that lie get on and ride again at once , in order to dispel any fear . The positive aggressiveness of that principle appealed to me , and I followed it . But it was not easy . Over and over during my convalescence I repeated the pattern of hesitating fearfully before doing something , then forcing myself to do it and thus eliminating the fear . That approach saw me through many small problems as the days went on , but it did n't seem to work for the recovery of skills . My concern about the many handicaps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see just what the problems were . The tests for , aphasia were simple , and I felt they were too elementary to indicate the extent of my handicaps , but they did show that my reading was extremely slow and jerky . More than anything else at that time I wanted to be able to read easily , but I didr. ' t know how to start working at it . That most of my handicaps centered in vision was becoming obvious , and it was in that area of the brain that the abscess had developed . But vision , in the brain , is more complicated than just seeing with the eyes . Vision involves directing and focusing the eyes , merging them at a single point , and interpreting what they see . I did not understand the mechanics of COMEBACK FROM A vision , but I knew it was impossible to keep my eyes on a line of print and move them easily along it to catch the thought . Often , before my eyes traveled the width of a newspaper column , there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all directions and become hopelessly scrambled . Sometimes a thought entirely foreign to the subject would come to mind , and later I would discover that my eye had picked up a word or two of heavy print from somewhere near the bottom of the page . Reading about Chiang Kai-shek , I would learn that he had the ball on the ten-yard line ? then realize my eyes had jumped to another column . As a result , I could not read more than a paragraph at a time , and even that required exhausting concentration . I thumbed through magazines restlessly , trying to read small items that looked easy . One day I struggled with a short poem in the " Post Scripts " column of the Saturday Evening Post . It shocked me to realize that my mind could n't grasp it . A second attempt was no better and , discouraged , I got back in bed to rest from the effort . Later I returned to the poem , determined to master it word by word , and line by line , by copying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a ' ' nonsense rhyme " that made no sense at all . T HE doctors had planned to let me go on sick leave about two months after the operation , but when they realized my determination to recover reading skill they arranged for me to take a course in rapid reading given to Air Force officers on duty at the Pentagon , in Washington . During the course , which lasted six weeks , my span of vision doubled in width , and my reading speed increased from 160 words a minute to over 350 . Tests at the hospital showed that during the course some vision returned in the right upper quadrant of my visual field . I am very sure that the intense effort for an hour each day , six days a week , stimulated its return . Daily trips from hospital to Pentagon required considerable effort . I declined transportation by automobile , because I felt there was more to gain by learning to find my own way . It turned out that catching busses , transferring , and timing my activities provided perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of orientation with regard to distance , direction , and spatial relationships had been shattered , and I needed practice in re . membering streets and directions , planning and following routes to get about the city , and mingling with crowds of people . Such things were not easy at first , for I had to stop in order to read signs or see what was in store windows , and I had to keep a sharp lookout to avoid collisions with other people . On the way through downtown Washington I visited the shops . Shopping in large stores had never been a pleasant task for me , and now I dreaded it . Moving through crowded aisles , searching for departments and the things I wanted , and describing them to clerks upset me almost to the point of panic . So I practiced by going into five- and ten-cent stores with definite objectives in mind , and making projects of finding specific things . It is difficult to explain what a severe discipline this was . It involved simultaneous use of vision , to find my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind what I wanted ; and poise in dealing with the clerks , for it was a fixed rule neither to explain nor excuse my handicaps , but to concentrate on overcoming them . In the Pentagon I met old friends , felt ashamed of my incapacities , but did not let myself follow the inclination to withdraw from people . I forced myself to meet them , talk with them , and arrange to see them again , for experience was beginning to teach me how to overcome the timidity that followed my illness . In the old army days of the horse we said , " When you come to a hurdle , if you throw your heart over it , the horse will go along , too . " It made sense , and when I forced myself to do things that were uncomfortable , it was not long before they became comfortable . When I threw my heart into them , the rest of me went along . For two to three months after the operation my schedule was full from morning to night , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each day started with physical exercises in the gymnasium , I made the trip to the Pentagon for reading practice , and in the evening my wife and I took long walks or kept social engagements . In every spare moment in between I practiced typing . I had used the typewriter for over thirty years and had become quite dependent upon it for work and pleasure . When I tried to type after my illness the garbled results had discouraged me . Then my wife analyzed my typing and found that most of the trouble came from striking too low and one space to the left with my right hand . The difficulty seemed simple enough to overcome , so I began typing at every opportunity , struggling to regain speed and accuracy while watching my right hand and using my old seven-finger style . As a result it took weeks of frustrating effort to restore my skill . In retrospect I know that it would have been better had I started anew with the orthodox touch system . wHEN I finished the rapid reading course the doctors suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hospital atmosphere and try my hand at the outside world . My wife and I decided to take a short trip to Cuba and Jamaica , then spend the rest of the time near St. Petersburg , Florida . We started out gaily from the hospital and taxied to the railroad depot in Washington , where the cab driver unloaded our bags and trunk locker on a sidewalk near the railroad station . Union rules did not permit the cab driver to carry baggage into the station , and Red Caps were not allowed to leave the station to get it , so I dragged the trunk into the station myself ? a little weak in the knees , but out in the world and on my own , and no mistaking it , Yet without my wife to handle time tables and itineraries we would have been badly off indeed , for numbers , schedules , and maps still confused my vision . Traveling , and directing my thoughts toward strange countries and people , instead of dwelling inwardly on my incapacities , had a most stimulating effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba , and Jamaica before moving into a small apartment overlooking the ocean at Pass-a-Grille Beach in Florida . Once there , however , I was ready to settle down to the final grind ? a review of arithmetic and mathematics . The doctors had told me that skill in mathematics would be the last ability to return . I had tried earlier to regain it and had failed . It had been during the summer whenthe temperature and humidity in Washington were at their worst . In spite of the heat by day and the sleepless nights , and in spite of a severe rash from the huge quantities of penicillin I had absorbed the month before , I had tried my hand at eighth-grade arithmetic . A young woman psychologist had offered to /1 , Ip me . I struggled with columns of figures , adding them over and over , but never getting the samc answer twice in succession . One day I had a particularly hard time getting the right answer . After my sixth attempt psychologist added her total again , blushed , and admitted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that was the exception rather than the usual result , for when I worked with numbers strange things happened that neither of us could understand . As soon as my wife and I were settled at Pass-a-Grille I tackled mathematics systematically . I found a second-hand book which reviewed aritimetic and mathematics , and included a section with answers to the problems . Progress was slow at first and required all the concentration I could muster . I found it useless to work after mental fatigue set in , for that only increased my errors . It took ten periods of daily work for me to solve the problems designed for the first three days . Two days and five separate attempts went to one complicated problem in factoring before I had the right answer . Nothing less than correct solutions seemed satisfactory , because my West Point training had stressed the importance of conscientious accuracy in thinking , as had my thirty years ' experience as a field artilleryman , in which accuracy meant the difference between success or failure in target firing , and life or death in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of three weeks I realized that the mathematical processes were not stumbling blocks at all , but that all my troubles came from misreading or misusing single numerals in simple arithmetic . It was vision again . Sometimes I read 30 and wrote 33 , and sometimes I added a number in a column , then added it again without realizing the duplication . In afternoon shuffle-board games I noticed that other people had trouble adding up scores , so I decided to relax about arithmetic and let my gradually improving vision correct the residual difficulties . THE course of my recovery had been marked by periods of hard work , often accompanied by discouragement and depression , followed by a sudden feeling of accomplishment and success . In the same week that mathematics came under control , my typing returned to normal speed and accuracy . I composed a long and difficult letter , found the first draft wholly satisfactory , . and typed it in final form without error . I felt a surge of confidence in all departments of living . " Lefts " and " rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straighten out , and to top it all my wife and I , as a team , took second place in a shuffle-board tournament , beaten only by the smallest possible margin . We returned to Walter Reed General Hospital , where I went through a final round of X-rays , examinations , and tests . The doctors found My physical condition excellent , my vision widened , and improvement all along the line . They told me I was qualified to return to full military duty . My goal was realized , and the six months of hard work repaid in full measure . During the month of tests , and while awaiting reassignment , I wrote . The doctors had encouraged me to keep a diary and to preserve the records of my methods and progress in recovering skills , so that they could studythem . In Florida , for typing practice , I drafted the material . Now , in Washington , I rewrote the 24,000-word manuscript in ten days , and my wife typed the final copies . Our inspiration in the effort was the skill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put me back on my feet as an effective member of society . My experience in the hospital had taught many lessons that I wanted to pass along for the benefit of future patients , for the effect of a brain operation is not all in your head . It involves the total personality in a bewildering complex of wishes and motives , conflicts and frustrations . But recovery of mental powers , physical co-ordination , and self-confidence is possible , if one will work at it . It takes motivation and self-discipline to overcome lethargy , but if the patient will accept discomfort as a stepping stone toward his goal , he can overcome handicaps and disabilities , and sometimes come out better than he was before . Each handicap is like a hurdle in a steeplechase , and when you ride up to it , if you throw your heart over , the horse will go along too . I came out from my long hours indoors over the typewriter , completing the case history and records , with a beautiful head cold . But what 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to duty after a brain operation ?
