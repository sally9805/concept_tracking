All week long , the whereabouts of the bulk of the U.S. Eighth Army , along the Seoul-Taejon axis , was obscured by censorship . For all that news readers in the U.S. knew to the contrary , the Eighth might have been retreating pell- mell toward Taejon . This week news of an allied counterattack in the Osan sector made it clear that the Army was no longer in retreat . <P> The Chinese had halted , after the fall of Osan , for what Eighth Army spokesmen said was a huge buildup of strength . Also , they seemed to be shifting strength laterally to the east , either to reinforce the hard-pressed North Koreans in the central mountains , or because they were unwilling to make a frontal assault along the Seoul-Taejon road . Since allied rear-guards had lost contact with the Chinese , they were ordered to turn around , push north until they encountered the enemy . <P> Tank-led infantry teams of the U.S. 3rd Division ( evacuated from Hungnam in December ) jumped off at 7 a.m. , five hours later slogged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns northeast of Osan , and finally , after an advance of twelve miles , ran into Chinese artillery and automatic weapons ' fire from high ground positions . <P> The Eighth Army seemed to have no fear that its supply line to Pusan &shy; and its possible line of retreat &shy; might be cut off , especially since U.N . forces in the central mountains were bravely and skillfully holding the Reds back from mountain passes that meant access to the plains north of Pusan . Below Wonju , the U.S. and Division , aided by French and Dutch battalions , held on . In the first counterattack since the fall of Seoul , they fought back briefly into the town , withdrew under small-arms fire . <P> For the rest of the week the battle below Wonju was a seesaw . Several times Hill 247 , a half-mile-long crest two miles south of the town , changed hands . One day , 6,000 screaming North Koreans drove the doughfeet off the hill , set up mortars on it and poured fire on nearby U.S. positions . After artillery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retook the hill . They abandoned it again after dark , without a fight . <P> At week 's end , some 30,000 Reds had poured around the right flank of the 2nd Division 's horseshoe position , and were setting up roadblocks several miles to the south . The 2nd Division fought back , showing no fear of entrapment.
