txt UNITED NATIONS , N. Y. , Oct. ** Dwight D. Eisen. - rower 's demand today that South Koreans , rather than Americans and other United Nations forces , defend their own front lines was received with amazement band incredulity by a number of United ? Nations . delegate 's . ' ? .. One delegate , whose country has troops fighting in Korea , said-philosophically that he had-now grown accustomed to American campaign oratory - and. that ' he - believed that if General-Eiaenhowe  --  were elected the duties df the PreSidency cyanid produde ' a more responsible sttitude . Other delegates , however , were very Critical . Col. Ben C. ' Limb , the Republic of South Korea 's observer at the United Nations ( the republic is not a member ) , said he was " in. hearty accord " with- General Eisenhower . However , he emphasized that he was thinking only . of the eventual withdrawal of United Nations forces from Korea or into the reserve and that it would be " unthinkable " to do so now . Colonel Limb explained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training program for Korean forces and that his Government was well pleased with the program . Other Korean sources estimated that 100,000 are already in training , in addition to the 150 , - 000 Korean ground troops now deployed . Says South Korea Is Grateful Colonel Limb declared that the people of South Korea were grateful to the United States and other United Nations members for helping to defend them , and that his Government had been pressing for the training program because it assumed other countries would not be willing to maintain troops there indefinitely . Assuming that 10 per cent of the population are able-bodied men of military age , South Korea could put a maximum of 2,000,000 men into the field , but they would be dependent on the United States for training and equipment , he said . According to latest estimates , United States ground troops in Korea total 250,000 , and an additional 48,000 have been provided ) by fifteen other United Nations members . In addition , aviation and , and several other United Nations members are also in action , American casualties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle deaths : According to month-old figures , casualties of all United Nations forces in Korea , including the United States and South Korea , totaled 384,609 . South Korean casualties include 37,167 ' dead and 112,427 wounded : British casualties , ? which ' were , third highest , were 3,250 , includ- , ing 513 dead . It has always been the expectation here that after an armistice had been reached.it would-be possible to ' start the gradual withdrawal of United Nations forces from Korea , but that their complete withdrawal would depend on , how much danger there was of the Commtiniste reopening the fighting . After more than a year of negotiation no one here knows whether , or how soon , an armistice , can be obtained . United Nations delegates lased some of their objections to General Eisenhower 's // EISENHOWER STAND AMAZES U. N. AIDES // statement on the commonly ac .. 1 *opted belief that all the United Nations forces now available , plus those of South Korea , would , barely be able to turn back another Communist offensive , Apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Korean forces for support would be imperiled if the latter were not available in sufficient quantity and quality . Another objection arises from the fear that the Soviet Union and Communist China might interpret General Eisenhower 's statement as meaning that under his administration United States support of the Korean war would fall off and that this interpretation might lessen the chances of an armistice . The Soviet Union repeatedly has demanded the withdrawal of " foreign troops " from Korea as the basis for an armistice . This demand , if taken at face value , would mean that the tooth Koreans and North Koreans would be left to fight out what the Soviet Union has always insisted is a civil war andsthArefore , not within the jurisdiction of the United Nations . - In view of the deadlock in the armistice negotiations , the United States ttiw is conferring with other ' UniLtd Nations members on the proposals it will offer in the Genkral Assembly , which will open its 1952 session on Oct. 14 . . Although Dean Acheson , Secretor/ of State , denied yesterday that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates said the following procedure Was planned : gldr . Acheson , who wants to be the first speaker when the opening ' debate begins about Oct. 15 or 16,1 will propose that the President of the Assembly appeal to Communist China and North Korea to accept an armistice . It is believed that at the same time he will threaten further action by the United Nations if they do not comply promptly . cThe Secretary of State will press for the immediate adoption of a resolution authorizing the President of the Assembly to makei the appeal , but omitting any threat . tiFurther debate on the Korean question will be postponed until after the United States election . q At that time , if there still is no armistice , the United States will press for a resolution which , among other things , would endorse the stand taken in the armistice negotiations by the United States as the agent of the United Nations , and would appeal to member nations to supply more armed forces . If sufficient support is found , the United States also would propose additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been disclosed .
