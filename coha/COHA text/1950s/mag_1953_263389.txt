An unprecedented crisis hit the Pentagon last week . A post belonging to one Air Force command had just moved under its own power into territory assigned to another command . What to do ? The Air Force paper-pushers had nothing in their files to guide them . <P> The post was an eight-man weather station on Fletcher 's Island , a great mass of ice floating in the Arctic Ocean . It was discovered more than two years ago by the Alaskan Air Command , and colonized last March with assorted weathermen , scientists and communication experts . Then , moving eastward at 2 miles a day , it floated into the jurisdiction of the Northeast Air Command . <P> The Alaskan airmen did not put up much of a fight . After a tricky deployment of Pentagon charts of organization , the ice men became naturalized employees of the Northeast Air Command ( headquarters : Pepperrell Air Force Base , Newfoundland ) . If Fletcher 's Island continues to creep far enough eastward , it will eventually enter the territory of some Soviet air command . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a trickier problem .
