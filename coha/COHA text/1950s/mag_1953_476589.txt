AN ACQUAINTANCE of mine , who joined the Communist party at an early age and wrote for its publications under his own name , left the party in 1939 . A year or so later he was drafted into the Army . Toward the end of the war , when he had achieved fairly high rank and was in a responsible position , a newspaper reporter exposed his erstwhile party connections , and he was flown to Washington to be interviewed by an important government official . " Is it true , " the official asked him , that you once wanted to overthrow the government of the United States by force and violence ? " " I guess so , " X said , and then added , " but that was only one of a lot of foolish ideas I had when I was young . " As if wondering what Further depths of iniquity were to he revealed , the official inquired apprehensively , " What ideas ? " " Well , " X said , " for a good many years I was perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garbo . " A fetch for a movie star , like many other indiscretions , can be easily forgotten , but not , as things are today , membership in the Communist party . Some of the leading citizens of the town in which I live were members of the Ku Klux Klan in the nineteen-twenties . Personally I think it is more honorable to have belonged to the Communist party than to have belonged to the Klan , but I quite understand that that is n't the issue . The Klan is dead , and the party , unhappily , is n't . No Klansman has been exposed as an agent of ahostile foreign power , and the wearing of a white sheet has come , with the passage of time , to seem as ridiculous and innocuous as a passion for Greta Garbo . The irreducible facts behind the present turmoil over communism are the danger of a war with the Soviet Union and the proven activity of some American Communists in the Soviet cause . Some liberals , in their dismay over the rise of McCarthyism , seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been losing their fight against McCarthy . The majority of Americans are determined , quite rightly , to defend themselves against . the Communists , and if they have accepted the leadership of McCarthy , that is in - part because liberal leadership often seems blind to fundamental realities . When , however , the reality of the Communist danger has been admitted , we must go On to say that the nature and extent of that danger are being grossly misconceived . For four or five years the basic misconception , as Alistair Cooke pointed out in A Generation on Trial , has been the equating of communism , 1935-39 , with communism , 1948-53 . At bottom , I now have no doubt , the party was the same in the thirties as in the forties and fifties , but what most Communists and fellow-travelers thought about the party in the earlier period was very different from what most people , including most of those who were members and sympathizers at that time , arc thinking about the party today . In the first hearings on communism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I listened to the testimony of Robert Gorham Davis , while waiting my turn , and I confess that I felt amazement ? arid some slight nostalgia ? as he talked about the little band of Harvard Communists to which he and I had belonged in 1938-39 . Even I had forgotten the way it was . TODAY that qualitative misconception , if I may call it such , is being compounded by a quantitative misconception . A year or so ago Commentary published an article on civil liberties by Irving Kristol , now executive secretary of the American Committee for Cultural Freedom , an anti-Communist organization to which I belong . In the course of the article , which made many valid points , Mr. Kristol asked : Did not the major segment of American liberalism , as a result of joining hands with Communists in a Popular Front , go on record as denying the existence of Soviet concentration camps ? Did it not give its blessing to the " liquidation " of millions of Soviet " kulaks " ? Did it not apologize for the mass purges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials of the Old Bolsheviks ? Did it not applaud the massacre of the non-Communist left by the GPU during the Spanish Civil War ? I know that the answer is supposed to be , " Yes , " but to each of these questions I am obliged to reply , " No . " Some liberals did some of these things , but I think it can be demonstrated that " the major segment of American liberalism " never did any of them . Mr. Kristol , I imagine , is not old enough to have taken part in the events of the thirties , and I think he is being misled by a group of individuals who ought to know better . These persons were anti-Communists , or at any rate anti-Stalinists , in the later thirties ? i.e. , at a time when Stalinists were in a position to talk back . There may have been some excuse then for their exaggerating the influence of the Communists , for they were on the receiving end . As the years have gone by , however , it seems as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have piled exaggeration upon exaggeration , until a myth has taken shape . To be specific , I will quote from an article by John Chamberlain in the Freeman : Long before Communist Harold Ware . . . planted his cell in the Department of Agriculture in Washington . . . the Communists were busy with Objective No. 1 , which was the capture of New York , the word capital of the United States . This job was pulled off in the thirties . . . In time , the infiltrees achieved a wide amount of power to give and withhold jobs , to accept and to refuse manuscripts , and to exalt or to sabotage books and articles . . . By their oblique control of writing in the thirties and early forties , the Communists managed to poison the intellectual life of a whole nation ? and the poison has lingered on . This is now what might be called standard opinion in certain anti-Communist circles . I have heard a prominent Socialist speak of " the Red stranglehold on the moving pictures and radio . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system has not yet recovered from the way it was debauched when dominated by the Communists . " Again and again the assumption is made that the Communists did in fact dominate American intellectual life for a period of ten or fifteen years . And this myth has spawned another myth : the myth of the persecution of the anti-Communists . W. H. Chamberlin , also writing in the Freeman , gave it definitive expression : It is highly probable that , if a fair , honest count were made of persons who were victimized during the war and immediate postwar period because they were " premature anti-Communists " and of those who have been called to account for real or alleged pro-Communist leanings , the number of cases in the first category would exceed the number in the second . The basic document in the creation of a distorted view of the thirties is The Red Decade , which Eugene Lyons , another disillusioned sympathizer with communism , published in 1941 . So far as facts go , the book is largely reliable , but the impression it gives is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my distaste for the names Lyons calls me ? for those I deserve even more than for those I do n't . This is all part of my past , and my attitude- is likely to be biased . But when I summon to mind all I know about communism in the thirties , I can not square my recollections with Lyons ' picture . II s A Communist in the thirties , I felt , and - rejoiced to feel , that I belonged to a movement that was growing in power . Thanks to the Depression , the party had greatly increased its membership and , even more greatly , its influence , and its influence continued to grow during the entire period , 1935-39 , in which I was a member . Yet as a writer , a publisher 's adviser , ? and . a teacher , I was never conscious of the kind of power in the intellectual world that John Chamberlain attributes to the- Communists . Far from capturing " the word capital of ? the United States , " we won only small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , beginning with the publishing business . I suppose that in the thirties almost every publishing house in the country had at least one Communist or Communist sympathizer on its staff . In many instances the political views of these men and women were known to their colleagues and superiors ; in others they were suspected ; in others they were more or less successfully kept secret . It is also true that many books sympathetic to communism were published in these years , and frequently , I am sure , it was a Communist editor who brought in a Communist book . It is fatuous , however , to conclude that these hooks were always , or even as a general rule , " put over " by these editors . What some people are able to forget is that there was a market for left-wing books in the thirties . One need not postulate a Communist conspiracy , for example , to explain why Covici Friede published John Strachey 's The Coming Struggle for Power ; in the atmosphere of 1933 the book was bound to be popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Masses in offering a prize for the best proletarian novel , was a victim not of a conspiracy but of an illusion that proletarian novels would sell . When Harper &; Brothers published the early books of Richard Wright , when Harcourt Brace published Ella Winter 's Red Virtue , when Doubleday Doran published Red Medicine by Sir Arthur Newsholme and John A. Kingsbury , when Random House published Angelo Herndon 's Let Me Live , when Knopf published Agnes Smedley 's books on China , these eminent firms were simply behaving like publishers . The Macmillan Company published my book , The Great Tradition , in 1933 , with full awareness that it purported to be a Marxist study of American literature . In 1935 they not only brought out a revised edition that was even more explicitly Communist but brought it out in co-operation with International Publishers , the official Communist publishing house . In 1936 Macmillan published my John Reed , a biography of a Communist by a Communist , and were happy to have it selected by the- Book Union , a book club whose Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the president of the company was an outspoken conservative , and none of the editors , so far as I ever discovered , was a Communist or a Communist sympathizer . I know something about the situation at Macmillan in the thirties , for I was one of the firm 's literary advisers . Naturally my judgments were influenced by the fact that I was a Communist , and this was taken for granted by the editors . It was so definitely taken for granted that I could n't have put anything over . I recommended a certain number of books that were sympathetic to communism , but I recommended them for what they were and on the grounds that they would sell . I also recommended , on the same grounds , some anti-Communist books , including Arthur Koestler 's first novel , The Gladiators On the other hand , the company published at least one Communist book -- Henri Barbusse 's Stalin ? that I never saw until it was in print . The policy that I followed in my work for Macmillan was , I like to think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common sense . After all , an editor or adviser who recommends a series of unsuccessful books , whether out of bias or out of bad judgment , does n't last long . For that reason , Communists in other publishing firms were obliged to adhere generally to the same policy , whether they liked it or not . " Infiltrees , " as John Chamberlain calls them , were probably responsible for some of the pro-Communist books published in the thirties , but they accomplished less than he thinks ? and less , 1 am sure , than they thought at the time . s PEOPLE forgot then and forget now , it is one thing to get a book published and another to get it read , as the fantastic story of Modern Age Books shows . This firm , which was founded to publish both reprints and original books in paper-bound editions , was financed by Richard S. Childs , who , to the best of my belief , was not a party member but vas scarcely a militant anti-Communist . Its pioneering experiment in publishing paper-bound books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , proved a failure , partly because there was n't sufficient study and preparation but also because the Communists took the firm over . Modern Age did a lot for the Communists . Heaven knows how many it employed in one capacity or another , and some substantial advances fell into Communist hands . Moreover , many party-line hooks were published . Some of these , including my own I Like America , did fairly well , but the majority were flops . Even when the party pushed them for all it was worth , they would not move . Childs poured in money , but the firm tottered and fell , and a lot of loyal Communists went looking for jobs . The story of Modern Age is in some ways comic , but it has , in my nostrils , a bad odor . When I think of the indignation that would have convulsed me in the thirties if there had been a publishing house staffed by Fascists and devoted to Fascist books , I can not feel complacent about Modern Age and the part T played in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence today , I would denounce it as promptly and as heartily as I would have denounced a Fascist concern in 1939 ? or would denounce one today . Yet it would be easy to exaggerate the evil that Modern Age was able to accomplish . If some of its books may have had a wide influence , most of them , I believe , were bought almost exclusively by people who were already convinced Communists . And the company was ruined , in no great length of time , by its Communist activities . Tn The Red Decade Eugene Lyons has a chapter called " Intellectual Red Terror , " in which he argues that pressure was used to prevent the publication of anti-Communist books and that such books , if they appeared , were attacked and vilified . I know of only one attempt to suppress a book , and Mr. Lyons mentions only one , and they happen to be the same : a concerted effort , in which I refused to take part , was made to try to persuade Viking Press not to publish Benjamin Stolberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were other attempts that succeeded , but the fact remains that many anti-Communist books were published in the thirties , none more successfully than Mr. Lyons ' Assignment in Utopia . All the writers he mentions as victims of the intellectual red terror ? John Dewey , Max Eastman , Ben Stolherg , James Farrell , John Dos Passos , William henry Chamberlin , etc. ? found publishers in the thirties . Nor was Lyons the only writer who was able to express his disillusionment with the Soviet Union ; he himself speaks of Andrew Smith , Fred Beal , Jan Valtin , Freda Utley , and the Tchernavins. 0 F COURSE these books were attacked in the Communist press , in language as virulent as that employed by Mr. Lyons . And in the heyday of the Popular Front there were , as he says , strategically placed reviewers who , if not Communists , tended to reflect the Communist line . But it was not my impression then , and it is not my impression now , that the Communists had things their own way . I wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1934 , in which I argued , with considerable evidence , that the New York Times Book Review assigned almost all books on Russia to anti-Communists , usually Russian enemies of the Soviet regime . I further pointed out that the editor and several of the principal reviewers consistently went out of their way to sneer at and belittle American writers known to be sympathetic to communism . Mr. Lyons can call my article part of the " intellectual red terror " if he wants to , but no one will deny that the Times had more influence in the world of hooks than the New Masses . Some time later ( December 7 , 1937 ) I wrote an article on the book reviews in the Nation . Both the Nation and the New Republic had played -a part in the leftward swing of the intellectuals , and in the later thirties both adopted editorial positions that were in general agreement with the Popular Front line . The Nation 's book section , however , was under the direction first of Joseph Wood Krutch and then of Margaret Marshall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large share of her reviewers from the rapidly expanding group of men and women who , after some contact with Stalinism , had grown disillusioned . A number of them were Trotskyites . Pro-Communist books , I pointed out , were given to such reviewers as Abram Harris , Edmund Wilson , Ben Stolbcrg , Louis Hackcr , Sterling Spero , Suzanne LaFollette , Anita Brenner , James Rorty , Philip Rahv , Sidney Hook , and James Burnham , all of whom could be counted on not to like them . The Nation 's book review section was an organ for those anti-Communists who , according to Mr. Lyons , had such a bad time . We felt ? make no mistake about it ? that we were the victims , that we were the ones who were being persecuted . The big magazines , those that paid good money , were notoriously hostile not only to communism and the Soviet Union but to virtually all the ideas advocated by the Popular Front . An individual writer for one of these magazines might be a Communist sympathizer , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any propaganda . Kyle Crichton , for instance , a staff writer for Collier's. saved his radical ideas for the articles he wrote for the New Masses under the name of Robert Forsythe ; he did not try to put them over in Collier 's . III I N FACT , communism scarcely made a dent on any of the mass media ? the popular magazines , the movies , the radio . Congressional investigations have revealed that some Hollywood writers and actors were Communists or fellow-travelers at one time or another . The investigations , however , have not shown that these Communists influenced in any significant way the content of the moving pictures . I remember back in the thirties how excited we were over advance reports on " Blockade , " which , we were told , was going to strike a great blow for the Loyalist cause in Spain . But when the picture appeared , it did not even indicate on which side the hero was , fighting . During the - war a couple of pic tures appeared that were favorable to the Soviet Union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . The Hollywood Communists have no doubt been useful to the party , to which they have given large sums of money and which they may have helped in other ways , but I am still waiting for someone to point out to me an American movie that actually contains Communist propaganda . And if there ever has been any propaganda , it has been a tiny drop in a large bucket running over with traditional American sentiments . The same thing is true of radio . There were commentators in the thirties who seemed to accept the Popular Front ideology , but most of them were exceedingly cautious . As a rule , the Communists in radio who have been exposed have been actors or script writers ? as unable to influence policy as their Hollywood brethren . The Communists in the radio industry may have exerted a malign influence , particularly in the unions , but they have not been able to get away with much propaganda . The black picture that Lyons paints has n't much relation to the reality that I recall . Speaking of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It could bar you from house parties on Park Avenue , jobs in Hollywood , places on the relief rolls of your city , fair treatment in the columns of great conservative papers , a hearing before supposedly broad-minded public lecture forums , access to federal projects . " Perhaps Communists did all these things at one time or another in one place or another , but the suggestion that they could do them all the time and everywhere is ridiculous . If we need further proof that Lyons exaggerates the Red influence , he furnishes it for us . In the spring of 1939 a group of nip and women , calling itself the Committee for Cultural Freedom , endorsed a statement that Lyons had prepared , denouncing totalitarianism as it existed in Germany , Italy , Spain , Japan , and Russia . " More than HO men and women in intellectual pursuits had signed this statement by the time it was made public in May , " Lyons says . " Scores of additional adhesions to this basic formulation of free men 's faith came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of the intellectual red terror ! There was , of course , a Communist counterattack ? an open letter protesting against " attempts to bracket the Soviet Union with the Fascist states . " Mr. Lyons gets a good deal of understandable amusement from the fact that this letter appeared just nine days before the Soviet-Nazi nonaggression pact , which made a lot of those of us who signed it feel silly ? and worse than silly . But perhaps the important thing to notice about the pro-Soviet letter is that its signers seem rather less distinguished than the signers of the anti-Soviet statement . Comparing the two lists , one gets the impression that anti-communism ? and this was anti-communism , not just non-cornm unism ? was the dominant intellectual force . If it was not on August 14 , 1939 , it certainly was a fortnight later . It is also important to observe that five of the signers of the Committee for Cultural Freedom statement had been among the fifty-two intellectuals who had endorsed the Communist candidate for President back in 1932 , and that at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even in the thirties , when communism seemed to be so powerful , it was constantly losing adherents among the intellectuals . The party used the intellectuals for all they were worth , but it was aware , as most people today are not , that there were limits beyond which most of them could not be used . To say this is no kind of defense of myself or anybody else , nor is it intended as one , but the fact has to be taken into account . IV T ins fact is particularly important when we turn to another field , the teaching profession . Many teachers , especially college teachers , were Communists or sympathizers in the thirties . Like other intellectuals , they saw the Great Depression as proof of the collapse of capitalism . They had , moreover , some special grievances against the status quo . Not only had they been badly paid even before the Depression ; many of them had been considerably pushed around by the business men who dominated the boards of trustees of the private colleges . Teachers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speech , but in practice they discovered that discretion was essential to professional advancement . In an article that I wrote after being dismissed from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , I called teaching " the timid profession , " and the phrase still seems apt . But if most teachers conformed , a certain number rebelled . Again it is hard to remember how much the atmosphere has changed . Today Communist teachers are charged with disloyalty to the government , with conspiracy in the interests of a foreign power , and with the surrender of intellectual integrity . In the thirties , however , Communists were charged , quite simply , with being anti-capitalists . Week after week in the spring of 1935 Acting-President Edwin C. Jarrett of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute maintained to all corners that my dismissal was purely a matter of economy . But in speaking to the alumni at Commencement time , Jarrett said : " We were founded by a capitalist of the old days . We have developed and prospered under the capitalistic regime . The men we have sent forth and who have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of the youth of the country , richly endowed us . . . . If we are condemned as the last refuge of conservatism , let us glory in it . " That same June Silas H. Strawn , former president of the American Bar Association , was the Commencement orator at Middlebury College in Vermont . After saying , " One of the guarantees of the federal Constitution is the freedom of speech , " he continued : " Recently we have heard much about ' red ' activities in the colleges and universities of the country . I am unable to sympathize with the elastic conscience of those who inveigh against the capitalistic system while on the payroll of a college or university whose budget , or whose existence , is due to the philanthropic generosity of those whose industry and frugality have enabled them to make an endowment . " No member of the Middlebury faculty was likely to miss the point , for earlier that spring each of them had received a letter from President Paul D. Moody , significantly headed , " Do n't rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students to be thoughtless , " President Moody informed his teachers , " nor do we want to tell them what to think . But we do not want them to go off at half cock . Least of all do we want them to go out of class quoting us as anarchists , Communists , atheists , free-lovers , as , I regret to say , now and then some student does . In all that is said about capital and labor , public utilities and government ownership thereof , marriage and divorce , social customs , the liquor question and a dozen and one other matters , we can not be too guarded . " He concluded : " I should fee/ justified in requesting , in these days as I might not in others , the resignation of any who are unwilling or unable to subordinate their private views to the interests of the College . . . . I hope that what I have said will not be regarded as in any way a desire to dictate what you shall think , or to interfere with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not justify the acceptance of a system that denies to teachers even a vestige of freedom and that punishes even accidental divagations not with dismissal but with execution ; but they help to explain why sonic teachers were in a mood to adopt desperate remedies . Most of the teachers who turned to communism refused to admit the extent of Soviet - tyranny , but , whatever excuses they invented to salve their consciences , they did know that academic freedom was sharply restricted in Russia . What they told themselves was that academic freedom was also restricted in the United States , and that one had to choose between communism and real or incipient fascism . The second proposition was false , but the truth of the first gave it a certain plausibility . The number of teachers who were Communists or fellow-travelers was never , of course , more than a tiny fraction of the teachers in the country . The vital question , however , is how much influence they were able to exert . The other day , speaking at a college for teachers , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would permit Communists to teach . I replied that this was a problem on which my views had changed more than once . At the moment , I said , I was inclined to feel that . I would retain , or even hire , an avowed Communist who was competent in his field , but that I would fire anyone who had concealed his Communist affiliation . I put this forward not as a solution of much practical importance but as a way of indicating that T saw little reason to be afraid of communism when it was in the open . My answer shocked a young woman , who drew a startling picture of a Communist teacher , luring his students on with his pleasant manners , winning great popularity among them , and seducing vast numbers to their eternal damnation . When she had finished , I could only say , " You do n't have much faith in the other teachers . " Her kind of argument , which I have heard again and again in a variety of forms , always assumes that Communist teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My own situation at RPI was not unlike the situation the young woman and I conjured up . My position as fellow-traveler was well known , for , writer-fashion , I had recorded my conversion , step by step , in the public press , and from January 1 , 1934 , on , I was on the editorial staff of the New Masses . Because my position was known , I had to behave in my teaching job as I behaved in my Macmillan job : I leaned over backward to keep my biases out of the classroom , and I called attention to them when they forced their way in . But even if I had done my level best to convert my students , how much headway could I have made against the several hundred members of the faculty who were thoroughly committed to the capitalist system ? The exponents of capitalism , moreover , felt perfectly free to express their views in the classroom ? this was not at all the kind of thing Acting-President Jarrett had in mind when he deplored the raising of " controversial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be restrained . T ATER , for one year , 1 was a Counsellor in American Civilization at Harvard J College , and I was a member of a Communist party branch made up of faculty members . It was this branch that was investigated last February by the House Committee on un-American Activities , and testimony indicated that its maximum membership was fifteen . As I pointed out to the committee , fifteen Communists , all in the lower academic grades , is not an impressive proportion of a large faculty ? I , 87g teachers , according to the World Almanac for /939 ? especially at a time when the intellectual atmosphere was favorable to communism and the party 's Popular Front line was supposed to be especially appealing to teachers . After I had been subpoenaed by the House Committee , I tried to recall as much as I could about the meetings of that branch . We discussed many different subjects : Marxism , the Soviet Union and the way it was maligned in the capitalist press , the dangers of Fascism , the Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our plans for the Teachers Union , and the manifold and exhausting activities that were part of the Popular Front movement . But I could not remember that we had ever talked about how we could carry on Communist propaganda in the classroom . The testimony of the other witnesses completely confirmed my impression . The point is , I think , that , although we were or believed ourselves ' to be convinced Communists , and were anxious to win converts , we knew there were limits . Some of us felt there were limits beyond which we should not go ; all of us felt there were limits beyond which we could not go . Many Communist teachers , I am sure , went just as far as they could in presenting the Communist view of their subjects , but few of them were so situated that they could go very far . How much influence they had on their students is anybody 's guess , except that it was much less than is supposed by those who , like the young woman I just mentioned , have swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seduction . There were many students in the thirties who joined the Young Communist League or belonged to one or another of the party fronts . Some of them , I am sure , were influenced by Communist teachers , but for the most part they were responding to the same influences as the teachers were . Communism was in the air , and a certain number of people were bound to catch it . And again one must take account of the operations of disillusionment . Of the Communist teachers I knew , the majority broke with the party a long time ago . The others , I may say , have-mostly been driven out of academic life , some because they were exposed as Communists , others because their dogged fidelity to the shifting party line rendered them obviously incompetent as teachers . Disillusionment is a phenomenon that has not been sufficiently examined . As I have pointed out , most of the men who are responsible for the myth of the Red Decade ? andmost of the highly articulate anti-Communists in general -- were themselves , for at least brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so did a larger proportion of their associates than they are willing to admit . I have already observed that five of the fifty-two signers of the 1932 Manifesto for Foster and Ford were ardent anti-Communists even before the Soviet-Nazi pact . Many of the others joined the anti-Communist ranks shortly thereafter . When the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace was held at the Waldorf-Astoria in 1949 , the list of sponsors included nine of the names that had appeared on the 1932 Manifesto . To me it is appalling that there could be nine so-called intellectuals who could follow the party line for seventeen years . But , statistically speaking , nine out of fifty-two is n't much of a showing . The significance of disillusionment , moreover , is not merely statistical . The fact that so many intellectuals have been disillusioned suggests that a lot of them were not very good Communists to begin with . The public has been educated by extracts from the writings of Lenin and Stalin to an understanding of what membership in the Communist party is supposed to mean , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bentley , who tried hard to be good Communists , have helped to create a picture of the perfectly disciplined party member , ready to obey without hesitation any command his superiors may give him . That is unquestionably the party ideal , but it is an ideal to which many Communists do not measure up , and in the later thirties , when it was seeking a respectable facade , the party did not even attempt to impose this ideal upon the intellectuals . Therefore , even if it can be shown that there were so many party members at such and such a time in such and such an institution , it does not follow that there were that many docile agents of the Soviet Union . Some of these people , if the party had tried to use them as agents , would have quit on the spot , and the party knew it . To SAY all this is not to extenuate the mistakes made by the intellectuals , myself included , who swallowed communism . I am saying that we were suckers , and to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever for an intellectual to say that he was duped , since that is what , as an intellectual , he should never allow to happen to him . We were taken in by ideas we should have seen through and people we should have suspected . And , being writers and publicists , we proceeded to take in other people , which is why the party was willing to bother with us in the first place . There is no telling how much damage I may have done , and though I have tried hard in the past fourteen years to undo it , I am by no means sure that I have succeeded . Nor am I suggesting that communism should be taken lightly today . Communism has never been so thoroughly discredited in the United States as it is right now , and if we could think purely in national terms , it would be nothing to worry about , but we have to think in terms of the world situation , and Communists as actual or potential agents of a hostile power arc a danger not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert to meet their propaganda , and , as a nation , we must be able to combat their espionage and sabotage . If the danger is sometimes exaggerated , it is nevertheless a danger . All I am trying to do is to destroy a myth . In his contribution to Socialism and American Life , one of the most careful students of the subject , Daniel Bell , writes : " Although communism never won a mass following - in the United States , it did have a disproportionate influence in the cultural field . At one time , from 1936 to 1939 , through the fellow-travelers in the publishing houses , radio , Hollywood , the magazines , and other mass media , it exercised influence on public opinion far beyond the mere number of party members . " That , I think , is absolutely true , but although the influence of the party undoubtedly was disproportionate to its membership , it was not unlimited . The notion that communism dominated American culture in the thirties is false . The notion has to be corrected , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage the myth of the Red Decade is doing to our national morale . Every time somebody says , - Boy , the Reds nearly got us in the thirties , " his listeners shiver , thinking , " It might happen again . " The significant , the hopeful point , as Frederick Lewis Allen suggests in The Big Change , is that it never did happen . Even in the early thirties , when millions of people were hungry and desperate , the Communists barely polled 100,000 votes . Even in the later thirties , when the Popular Front had captured the allegiance of many intellectuals , they made little impression on the solid anti-communism of the great majority of the American people . Even when it tried to disguise itself as twentieth-century Americanism , communism could not count more than a few hundred thousand sympathizers . A hundred thousand disciplined Communists might be something to think twice about , but most sympathizers were as far from the Leninist ideal as most churchgoers are from the Christian ideal , and they soon found plenty of reason for backsliding . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural enough . What is encouraging is that it seemed highly unattractive to all but a handful fifteen and twenty years ago , when our system appeared to be on the skids and when much less was known than is known now about Communist tyranny and aggression . Fifteen years ago I would have asserted that the American attitude towards communism was a result of misinformation and prejudice , and certainly it was n't a purely rational thing . But it was n't wholly irrational either . Most people felt that , however terrible the crisis was , we could figure out some way of meeting it . They did n't see any sense in tearing up the system , no matter how badly it was working , and trying one that looked good on paper . And they viewed with what turns out to be fully justified suspicion the Russian denial of national self-interest . In short , if we were suckers , most people were n't , and it seems to me that that happy fact deserves to be publicized .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
