THE PRESENCE OF GRACE ( 191 pp. ) -J . F. Powers-Doubleday ( $2.95 ) . <P> J. F. ( for James Farl ) Powers , 38 , likes to explore a placid world that stirs with life only after some trifling event breaks up the humdrum of routine . It is the parochial world of pastors , curates and their parishioners . The mocked and pitied heroes of Powers ' short stories are usually worldly U.S. Roman Catholic priests who have mislaid their sense of vocation in the hubbub of parish politics , bingo socials and Legion of Decency campaigns . Illinois-born and Catholic-reared . Author Powers brings an unsparing eye and a spare style to the subject of priestly frailty , but writes with enough basic compassion to avoid mere anticlericalism . He shares the front rank of present-day U.S. short story writing with such writers as John Cheever and J. D. Salinger , and he surprisingly evokes the same sad dilemma that plagues Cheever 's disenchanted Upper East Side Manhattanites and Salinger 's poor little rich boys with fractured psyches . The Presence of Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter 's Pence . In the lead story , Dawn , Father Udovic finds a packet of trouble in the collection plate . It is an envelope addressed to " The Pope , " marked " Personal , " gathered up in Father Udovic 's campaign " to personalize Peter 's Pence " by having the bishop , who is going to Rome , " present the proceeds to the Holy Father personally . " For days the innocuous-looking envelope ticks like a time bomb in the bishop 's " In " box . Father Udovic finally sends for the letter writer , a laconic little woman who grudgingly reveals that the envelope contains a dollar with her name and address on it in ink . " I mean I do n't want somebody else takin ' all the credit with the Holy Father ! " she explains . Father Udovic recognizes that the woman and he are caught alike in the sin of pride : " It seemed to him , sitting there saying nothing , that they saw each other as two people who 'd sinned together on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only blaming each other for what had happened . " <P> Death of a Favorite and Defection of a Favorite are sardonic studies of ambition in the hinterlands . A Midwest farm-country curate itches for his aged pastor 's post as rabidly as if it were a cardinal 's red hat . Only after he trips over all his political guide wires does the curate acquire a saving measure of humility . The two tales are notable not only for Powers ' quiplash irony ( " Scratch a prelate and you 'll find a second baseman " ) but for being told in the first person by the parish house cat , an unlikely but effective observation post from which the humans frequently appear the more feline . <P> Lampooning the Vulgar . Powers ' talent reaches also outside the rectory . In Blue Island a young suburban housewife 's get-acquainted coffee pour turns into a cruel social fiasco when an older woman who has posed as a friend suddenly does a commercial spiel on furniture polish in mid-party , and later presses a collapsible mop on the sobbing hostess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
