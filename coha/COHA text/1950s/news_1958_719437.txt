txt KUD , Kashmir , Jan. 10 ? Sheikh Abdullah returned . to political life in Kashmir today . He charged that India had " smashed the confidence of the Kashmir people " and established an illegal Government supported by bayonets . Running through charges by the Sheikh , who was released from prison Wednesday after four and a half years , was the most serious accusation any Moslem leader could make in India : mistreatment of Moslems by Hindus . The Sheikh said it was that mistreatment that had turned the people of Kashmir against India , led him to complain to New Delhi and finally resulted in his removal as Prime Minister of Indian Kashmir and his arrest on Aug. 9 , 1953 . Charges Betrayal by India " I did not betray India , " he said . " It was India that betrayed me . " The Sheikh sat in a small whitewashed room in a travelers ' rest house . He spoke of having to get in touch again with the Kashmiri people , but he made it quite clear that he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Lion of Kashmir . " Several times the Sheikh said he was not bitter and was not an " enemy of India . " But the word " betrayal " came again and again : into his conversation . It was a strange interview the Sheikh gave to a group of Indian correspondents and two foreign correspondents . It was almost &; like two interviews , given by two different persons . Supports a Plebiscite For the first hour the Sheikh dodged most questions with the answer that it was too early to say just what he would do . He made it clear that he supported the idea of a plebiscite to determine Kashmir 's future but would not say definitely whether he would prefer rule by India , or Pakistan or independence . To New Delhi , which regards Kashmir 's accession to India as final and a plebiscite as virtually unthinkable , this will De the final proof that the Sheikh has turned away from Kashmir 's union with India , which he himself forged in 1947 . The Sheikh enjoyed himself that first hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old days of the struggle for independence . He said mildly that he had been called a traitor and would go ' // back to his people to see what they thought of him . Then a second Sheikh Abduliah seemed to take over . He stopped toying with the buttons on his black tunic , stopped , toying with questions and suddenly became a man full of passion and anger . He spoke with flashes of scorn of his old disciple , Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed , now Prime Minister of Indian Kashmir . He said he had known for months that Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed had intended taking power . " One day I called a confidential meeting of the party and said that if they wanted a new leader in whom they could have unqualified trust I would be the first to welcome him , " said the Sheikh . " Bakshi said right away , ' Who is the man who wants to take over from you Sheikh Sahib ? ' and I said , ' You Bakshi , ' and Bakshi wept . " He said neither Bakshi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , former Maharajah of Kashmir and now head of state ( " We put him there " ) had the power to arrest him and made it clear 1he blamed most of all his old1 mrade Jawaharlal Nehru . , He charged that some of his assistants who had been imprisoned were treated . like captives in a " Nazi concentration camp . " He said he would not recognize any decisions taken by the Government of Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed since it had usurped power and was supported by force . But the most important and potentially the most dangerous charges made by the Sheikh were those about discrimination against Moslems , who form a majority of the populatithi in Kashmir , by the central Govern-1 ment of a largely Hindu . India . " It Was Sheikh Abdullah , remember , who was mainly instrumental id- bringing the link between India and'Kashmir , " he said . " I told the MussitImans that they would find safety in India , would be treated with justice , better than justice , treated generously . " At another point , coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribesmen from Pakistan attacked in 1947 , he said : " The Moslem feels ' if I join with India I 'll be drowned in a sea of Hinduism . ' " But my answer was no . A nation that could produce Gandhi can not be false to you . Only Gandhi could purchase , me in him I saw that flicker of light . Blood of my coreligionists flowed , but I saw that light and I came to Gandhi and I fell at his knees . " The Sheikh said that at one time he had told Mr. Nehru not to fear " a thousand plebiscites " but that as time passed New Delhi 's actions made it impossible for him to live up to his promises to his people . The Sheikh detailed some of his complaints . He said the Indian Government had discriminated harshly against Kashmiri Moslems in the army and state militia , had refused to give jobs to Kashmiri Moslems in the postal service , had established a central intelligence bureau in Srinagar to bribe and corrupt his officials , had forced some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforms under which land was taken from large holders without compensation . The Sheikh said he had complained to New Delhi but , getting no redress , had let hints of his dissatisfaction creep into his speeches . It was then he said that a plot was laid to jail him on charges of having conspired with foreigners including ) " that man  --  what 's his name ? Stevenson . " He evidently meant Adlai E. Stevenson , who visited Kashmir in May , 1953 , on his world tour . " Stevenson is alive . " he said . " Go ask him if I conspired with him . " The Sheikh leaned forward then to the Indian correspond- ' ents . He accused the Indian ) press of feeding the Indian people lies about him . The Sheikh said he did not know when he would go to Srinagar . When the Sheikh does return he will find the two largest parties  --  the National Conference 14 founded and the new leftist Democratic National Conference  --  firmly tied to union with India .
