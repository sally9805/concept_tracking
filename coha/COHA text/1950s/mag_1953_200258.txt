During 15 years of work with the police and with insurance companies , William Wirich Harper of Pasadena , physicist-consultant on auto accidents , has investigated 3,000 smashups . He has come to a basic conclusion : " We have spent too damn much time worrying about the cause of accidents . It 's time we started worrying about the cause of injuries . " <P> Fifty to 60% of injuries are due to people being thrown against the inside of the car . Twenty to 30% are due to people being thrown out of the car . Only ten to 20% are caused by actual crushing of the passenger space . <P> The simplest way to avoid injury , Harper says , is to wear a safety belt , which at the very least will keep the passenger from being thrown out . He should usually escape serious injury unless the car is crushed . <P> Auto manufacturers , Harper insists , could easily reduce the killing effect of accidents . One simple improvement would be to attach the seats so firmly that they can not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be to pad the dashboard properly and remove its projecting knobs , which Harper calls " fangs of death . " Even at very slow speeds a person can die of a punctured skull if his head hits a fang of death . <P> With safety belts and a few improvements in car design . Harper believes , " we can have a world where there may be accidents , which are normal when you put men in machines , but where there will be only rare injuries . "
