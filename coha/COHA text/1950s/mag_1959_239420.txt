As readers of TIME 'S Letters section ( and , indeed , of the daily newspapers ) well know , TIME has been hotly criticized in recent weeks for its coverage of unpleasant news in some countries friendly to the U.S. , notably for stories of the economic crisis in Bolivia , the aftermath of revolution in Cuba , and government corruption in the Philippines . Replying to this criticism has given us the opportunity to restate some truths about TIME , and I thought you might like to see where we stand . The following is the text of one reply to a critic : <P> IT is your contention that American journalists generally-and TIME 'S most particularly-are doing a disservice to the cause of freedom by reporting the news with too much freedom . <P> You repose the old question : What is truth ? Fine . That is what good journalism is all about-the pursuit of truth . But a less elusive and more pertinent question might be : What is news ? For some reporters , news can be simply what the government spokesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a given question , or what the official press release says it is . For many this is not enough . <P> You say that " isolated facts , true in themselves ' ' are not necessarily the truth . Agreed . We believe that isolated facts are far from enough ; we are very much committed to amassing the facts and , if we can , isolating the truth . " Truth , " you say , " is wholeness , balance and harmony . " These are three good words , and we work by them . <P> There can not be-as you seem to be suggesting-shifting standards of reporting from country to country , depending on its coloration in the political spectrum , its alignment in the East-West struggle , its degree of neutrality or friendliness . There is only one way to report it , and that is as you find it . <P> You alluded disparagingly to our coverage of the Philippines and Bolivia . I could burden you with documentation on the painstaking job of professional reporting that backed up the stories in question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no evidence that we were wrong in either case . <P> IN countries the world over , the press struggles in the toils of one I form of oppression or another . Of course , in the Communist world , where press control is traditionally total , there is no perceptible struggle . But in freer countries there are subtler means of entrapment . There are the subsidized newspapers ( and editors ) , the " guided " press , censorship , newsprint allocations , and more . All operate in the same direction-away from the people 's right to know . <P> Our job at TIME is to try to get at the facts and their meaning , to find out what 's really going on-in the U.S. or in Bolivia , in art or in politics . As responsible journalists in a free society , we take our job with the utmost seriousness , and I know of no publication that devotes more effort to covering the news and , indeed , to the uncovering of it . Thus , we are likely to be singled out among journals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will mean that as practitioners of responsible journalism we shall be dealing-fairly and accurately , I hope-with unpleasant subjects from friendly lands . But how could it be otherwise ? Unless , of course , you are calling for a guided press .
