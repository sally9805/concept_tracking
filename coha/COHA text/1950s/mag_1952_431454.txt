I know now where we first met , you who read this and I. It was on the Tagus River , near Lisbon , Portugal , the night of February 22 , 1943 . You wo n't recall being there ; at the time I did n't know you were there either . It seemed then that there were just the fifteen of us who , by some miracle , were to live through that nightmare crash of the huge sky clipper . But surely that was where our friendship began . And yet the Jane Froman writing this was n't really there either , because there are two Jane Fromans . One I used to be . One I am today . Perhaps you 've heard about the patriotic Jane , who set out to sing to the GIs in Europe ; the unlucky Jane , whose body was so badly smashed when the plane fell ; the brave Jane , who went through twenty-five operations rather than let the doctors amputate a leg . Whenever I think I ought to be impressed by all this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubborn Jane , whose ego made recovery twice as hard ; a too-proud Jane , who hated to be stared at or pitied ; a foolish Jane , who took far too long to learn the difference between pity and sympathy , between mere curiosity and sincere interest , between winning success and winning approval . And I see a lucky Jane , who found you , as she found herself , by accident . I believe that today I have neither false pride nor false modesty . I have had a wonderful success and a miraculous recovery . But I am still crippled ? there , the horrid word is out and it may be that I always shall be . Perhaps for that very reason I can help others who are crippled , like me ; perhaps I can also help those who are full of sympathy and good will , like you . Suffering did not make a saint of me . Neither did it make me a hypocrite . Sometimes I ache like the devil ; when I do , I act like the devil . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around me if once in a while I behave like a crotchety human being . Today I can answer your questions frankly , though once I might have thought them none of your business . What did I think of when the plane struck ? Some ask me this in the hope of an inspiring answer ; some would like to know how it feels to face death . My reply is valueless.  | We had no forewarning of disaster . One moment we were flying ; the next , we had crashed . There was n't time for anything but a heart-stopping instant of fear . All the other things came later . Among these later things was hate . For three years I hated you . Hated you for staring at me because I was a crippled freak ; hated you for pitying me . Of course , these were my own thoughts , turned against myself , but I blamed you for them . Like an injured animal , I tried to hide ; and I hated you the more because I could not . I was burdened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I paid for passage home from Lisbon . on a little Portuguese freighter , and it was to continue until the total reached an unbelievable $350,000 . My earnings had been high , my savings substantial . They melted away in a matter of months . I could n't walk , I could n't even stand ; yet in order to finance still more operations , I had to go back to work . And for me , working meant appearing in the spotlight . I know now that if I had n't had to work , I might never have recovered ; but at the time I could only pity poor Jane . I hid as best I could . Skirt hems and sleeves were lowered to conceal scars , casts , braces ; curtains were lowered while I was lifted on and off stage ; lights were lowered while I was chained upright aboard the mobile piano that lugged me around night-club floors . You were so kind ; yet bitterly I charged your attendance to curiosity , your applause to pity . I tried to hold you off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial a young woman can face : I was convinced that no man would ever find me attractive again . It was typical of my attitude during those three years that off stage I went around in sackcloth . Pretty clothes ? Not for me , I thought While I believed this , I could not begin to get well . BUT WHEN the great day finally came that John told me he loved me , I went on a wild shopping spree . That trip downtown to the stores was my first real step on the long road to recovery . I met so many of you along the way . There was the nurse who never smiled . " What a sourpuss , " I used to think . But one day something made her grin in spite of herself . Even as I caught a glimpse of two sadly overlapping front teeth , I thought , Why , she 's quite pretty when she smiles ! I had learned something . It was n't the crooked teeth that were spoiling her life ; it was the way she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer seemed so necessary for me to hide my scars . There was Don Saxon . That first September , seven months after the crack-up , I was in Artists and Models . Men carried me on stage , propped me up so my cast was hidden , and made me look as graceful as possible . Then Don and I sang a duet ? accompanied by the appalling smell of putrefaction that went with osteomyelitis , the bone infection in my leg that simply would not heal . It is hard to describe the- agony of my embarrassment when the heaviest perfume proved useless once the heat of the footlights began to get in its work . There was poor Don , singing me a love song ; how could he pretend to ignore that poisonous reek ?  | He did n't try . Instead , right in the midst of my part of the song , he bent lovingly toward my ear and breathed , " Mmmmm ? leg smells pretty powerful tonight . " I gasped , but managed to go on singing . Then when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stinker ! " The impossible had happened . I was able to joke about something it was n't even polite to mention ? and I was no longer embarrassed . Then there were those wounded guys I met when I went back to Europe in 1945 ( by boat this time ) to do what I 'd started out to do two years before . If it cheered them up to be entertained by someone as battle-scarred as me , you ca n't imagine how it boosted my morale to see men so cheerfully determined to overcome handicaps much worse than mine . A case of misery loving company ? I do n't think so . I saw boys much stubborner than I ( they had to be ) who had learned the hardest lesson of all ? how to accept help from somebody else . That was what I was having such difficulty learning , and until I did , I could n't get well . E VENTUALLY the time came when it got too tough to go on alone ; I had to admit to myself that nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help even of God . Now , when I was ready to give up , there was nothing left to do but call on some greater Power . Thus it was that in my weakest hour I found my greatest strength . It was a strength you had tried to tell me about from the very beginning when you wrote your messages of encouragement . The letters , from people of all kinds and creeds , each echoed the same loving words , " God bless you . " Indeed He has blessed me ; blessed me so much I find it difficult to answer that toughest of all questions : " Jane Froman , would you go through it all over again ? " There I am in a plane . In front of me are two buttons , one marked " Land , " the other " Crash " ; which would I push ? How can I be sure I 'm answering correctly ? Maybe when the actual moment came , I would n't have the courage of my convictions . But if mine were the only life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Crash . " Because , against everything bad that has happened , there are these things on the right side of the balance sheet : My husband , John , and our wonderful life together . My profoundly deeper faith in God . My career and the new honors it has brought me . And finally , the very different Jane Froman I have become . Will I ever be able to discard the brace I wear on my right leg ? I do n't know , and neither do the doctors . The leg 's still mine , and I can now hobble about ten feet without the brace . But osteo is almost as stubborn as I am and bursts out anew from time to time . Still , I do n't believe I 'm kidding myself if I say that I 've come round to the doctors ' first opinion that the leg itself is n't so important . I 'm glad to have saved it ; but I have an idea that if I ever lost it , I could learn to do a pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I can do on the leg I 've got . However , I could n't be nearly as good a weather prophet as I am now ; I 'm a regular whizbang when it comes to predicting snow . That leaves one last question I 've often  | wondered about : " Do I sing better than I used to ? " Several years before Lisbon . I recorded eight songs . Not a single one of them became even a moderate hit . This year an album of songs I sing in the picture With a Song in My Heart became- a best seller before the picture was released . Did this mean I was singing better , or was it just that you were being sentimental ? A reissue of the old records gave me a chance to find out . I listened to them critically , and I had to admit that Jane Froman 's voice would never excel that earlier performance in technical perfection . But the delivery was ice-cold ! Even to myself , I sounded like a stranger . Those records tell my story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vacuum world like that of the recording studio in which I was alone with a cold metallic mike . Today , though the muffling door swings closed and shuts me from the outer world , it is no longer a mike I clasp ; it is a friendly hand . Then 1 know it is not to an empty studio that I sing . I am singing to someone I know well , though it was only by accident that we met.  |
