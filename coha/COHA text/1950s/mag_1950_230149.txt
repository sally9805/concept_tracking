TIME ( Dec. 26 ) had reported that the French army 's Chief of General Staff Georges Marie Joseph Revers had been relieved of duty because of a leak of French political secrets to IndoChina 's Communists . For three weeks after the report was printed , the French government said not a word . A few French newspapers hinted at serious charges against Revers and his friend , retired General Charles Emmanuel Mast . In the cozy Chez Albert , where France 's deputies dine in the shadow of the grimy Palais-Bourbon , hushed conversation turned more &; more to I'affaire des gnraux . Then the scandal burst into open flame , and Premier Georges Bidault hastily summoned Defense Minister Rene Pleven back from London to attend a special night cabinet session on the matter . <P> Last week Premier Bidault stated the facts of the case before the Assembly . " The country , " he said somewhat belatedly , " has a right to know the truth . " <P> Bidault told the Assembly that the Paris police had picked up a young Indo-Chinese after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report on Indo-China written by Revers . Police traced the report back to a " double or perhaps triple " informer and onetime embezzler named Roger Peyre , who said he had gotten the report from General Mast . Revers meanwhile had admitted giving it to Mast . Peyre , said Bidault , then sold the report for 2,800,000 francs to another agent who then turned it over to the Indo-Chinese Communists . Peyre intended to use the money as a campaign fund to support the candidacy of General Mast for the post of High Commissioner to Indo-China . <P> The Ministry of National Defense examined the report in an effort to appraise the damage done by the leak . It concluded that the report , " while of a confidential political character , could not be considered as national defense secrets . " Peyre and the other agents with whom he had dealt were released , and Peyre reportedly set sail for South America . Meanwhile , General Mast had retired , and General Revers remained " at the disposition of the Prime Minister . " That was all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France 's own Communists leaped enthusiastically into the ensuing fray , seizing the occasion to sling more mud at Bidault . Accusations , denials and counteraccusations were scattered like shrapnel . After three hours of stormy debate the Assembly voted to form a committee to investigate the whole affair .
