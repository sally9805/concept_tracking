Question : How to make an airplane or missile fly farther and faster . Answer : Give it fuel that packs more punch . <P> Last week a super-secret conference met at Dayton 's Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to discuss high-energy " exotic " fuels , the hottest subject in the air propulsion business . The conference issued no public report , but it is well known that all major engine and rocket-motor manufacturers are experimenting with the new fuels , and that chemical plants are being built to produce them in quantity ( TIME , March 18 ) . <P> High B.T.U. When engineers speak of fuel , they mean any material that yields energy as a result of chemical reaction . This definition excludes nuclear " fuels . " e.g. , U-235 , but it includes thousands of lesser energy-yielders . Petroleum hydrocarbons ( gasoline , kerosene , etc. ) are the commonest aviation fuels only because they are plentiful , convenient and relatively cheap . Many other chemicals yield more energy . Hydrogen has the highest heat of combustion ( 52,000 B.T.U.* per lb. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lb . ) . Hydrocarbons , which contain both carbon and hydrogen , are therefore intermediate . Kerosene burned in jet engines yields only about 18,500 B.T.U. per lb . <P> It would be nice to use pure hydrogen , but this is impractical because hydrogen is a gas that can not be kept in the liquid state without extreme difficulty . Next best is to " liquefy " hydrogen by making it combine with some other element to form a conveniently liquid compound . Kerosene is such a liquid , but it contains too much low-energy carbon . <P> Fortunately , nature has provided a chemical element , boron , which can be forced with some difficulty to improve on carbon 's performance . Boron has a high heat of combustion ( 25,000 B.T.U. per lb. ) , and it forms compounds that contain more energy-rich hydrogen than most hydrocarbons do . The heat of combustion of diborane ( B2H6 ) , for instance , is 31,000 B.T.U. per lb. , almost twice as good as kerosene . <P> Cloud of Poison . But boron hydrides are bad actors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spontaneously for no apparent reason . This disadvantage may have been overcome , but it is more likely that the best boron-containing fuels are compounds of boron with carbon , hydrogen and perhaps other elements . There is a long list of such compounds to choose from . A boron-carbon-hydrogen compound would not be quite so powerful as a straight boron hydride , but it might be a pleasanter playmate . <P> Boron fuels , with their higher energy and higher temperature of combustion , will come close to doubling the range of airplanes . In long-range missiles , they may make the difference between success and failure . They will be expensive ( at least $1 per lb. ) and probably highly toxic . They will burn with a bright green flame , and their exhaust , a white cloud of solid boron compounds , will be so poisonous to vegetation that tests will have to be run in deserts .
