One defense witness was called ( before the trial was adjourned until Monday morning . Moretti is charged with the slaying of Arthur Gamino , 15 . A jury of six men and six women is hearing the evidence . In spite of the snowstorm , the courtroom in criminal courts building was jammed with spectators . They listened in rapt attention as the special prosecutors , Harold A. Smith and Richard B. Austin , wound up their case by reading three statements Moretti had given shortly after the shooting , about 3:30 a. m. , Aug. 24 . Two Slain in Parking Lot In the statements the jury heard for the first time that Moretti , assigned to the state 's attorney 's office , was on furlough at the time.of the shooting . Eddie Salvi , 21 , was killed with Gamino , and Leonard Monaco , 21 , was wounded . Moretti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking lot at 819 Blue Island ay . Monaco , the state 's star witness , completed his testimony on crossexamination during the morning session . A medical expert also was called to testify that samples i of blood from the bodies of Gambino and Salvi would not indicate they were drunk . Earlier a state - witness had testified that in his opinion they were intoxicated . The first defense witness , Len O'Connor , a radio commentator , was on the stand only a few moments . Refuses to Tell Identities Allan R. Bloch , defense counsel with Michael Romano , tried to force O'Connor to divulge the names of two witnesses who had been mentioned in a broadcast arranged by O'Connor . " I am not free to disclose their identities , " said O'Connor . When the defense attorneys requested the court to direct him to testify , Austin objected to the wrangle with the attorneys ' own witness and the court sustained the objection . O'Connor was excused . The afternoon session closed early because Judge Marovitz is going to Washington to attend a wedding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romano said he expected to put in the defense testimony in about three days . He said he expected to call about 10 witnesses . The prosecutors took five days to put in their case . Outlines Own Defense A capsule view of the defense was contained in the statement : : read by Austin . In them Moretti pictured himself to his interrogators as a policeman who loved his work and felt deep remorse that his duty required him to kill . The three statements were taken from Moretti on Aug. 25 , the day after the shooting , and on Aug. 27 , three days later . The first one taken in St. Azthony 's hospital by James A. Brown , an assistant state 's attorney , contained a succession of such answers as : " I do n't remember nothing , " " I do n't remember what happened , " and " At this time I do n't remember . My mind is hurting me . " The second , taleen.in the Bridewell ' hospital the morning of the 270 , drew similar answers . Mow etti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as he felt better he would make a statement . Later that day Moretti gave Brown a 34 page statement describing his activities fully on the night of the shooting . The statement concluded with a passage in which Brown told Moretti he was being held on suspicion of murder because he had shot three men on Thursday and had made no state , ment to authorities until Monday , three days later and then only after talking to Atty . Bloch . In the early part of his statement Moretti had told of going to Tito 's Hacienda , 738 S. Halsted st. , to look for a dope peddler named " George . " Tells of Tavern Fight " I walked Into Tito 's with Sharkey I Alphonso Toribio , a prosecuthni witness who had testified Moretti was drunk and abusive and asked for coffee , " the statement read . " I looked around and I said to Sharkey , ' Do you see a fellow named George ? ' " A fellow three stools away got up . He said , ' That 's my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head . A fist hit me in the mouth . and that 's all I remember until I was out in the street . " Moretti said that he found that he lad been robbed of his gun , his wallet , and his money . It was while he was looking for his gun that he came upon the three young men . They also had gone to the lot to look for the gun because the owner of the tavern had been threatened with loss of his license unless it was returned . They had not been in the fight . Morettl 's Version of Shooting Moretti told of the shooting as follows : " As I was walking by the empty lot . I saw three men stooping over looking for something . One had a flashlight and just then I saw tha flashlight on one of their hands . I saw the gun in the hand . " I hollered , ' stop , police . ' They ran for the car parked in the lot . I ran after them . They got in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was hollering ' police , get out . ' Then ... bing , I hear a shot . I started firing . I reached in and grabbed the gun from the f ell ow in the front seat and started firing with both guns . I saw a yellow handled knife flash at me . Then I went out to the street to try to stop a motorist so I could report the shooting . " Several times in the narrative Moretti asserted that he felt " all right " and was in full possession of his faculties after his beating in the tavern . His delay in making the statement has been attributed by the defense to his injuries in the fight . Moretti also denied that he drank on the night before the shooting and said that he never did drink . To Capt . Patrick Groark and other Policemen with Brown when the statement was taken Moretti said : " I hope you never have occasion to shoot anybody : I had to do my duty as a police officer , but I hope it never happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of my life . It 's a lesson for all of you . " Told of Murder Suspicion After he finished his statement , the transcript showed that he asked Brown what his status was : " I 'd like to know if I. am being held or am I going home , " he said . Brow n 's reply was : " You 're being held on suspicion of murder . Three men were shot Thursday and this is Monday . This is the first time you 've made a statement , and your lawyer came in and talked to you ; I do n't know how long . " The August grand jury failed to indict Moretti by one vote . After the special prosecutors were appointed the October grand jury indicted him for murder in both slayings and for assault upon Monaco . Hammers at Story of Witness In the cross-examination of Monaco , Bloch continued to hammer at his credibility as a witness . Since Moretti and Monaco are the only witnesses to the shooting , the jury ultimately will be faced with deciding whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bloch asked if Monaco saw and could identify the man who " frisked " searched the three young men before they were ordered into the car . " He was standing right in front of you , did n't you see him ? " asked Bloch . " I turned my head , " said Monaco . a Why ? a " I always turn my head , " said the witness . " You always turn your head when you 're frisked , " pounced Bloch . " Yes , " said Monaco . Bloch Repeats Answer " What was his answer , Mr. Bloch , " asked Romano , so the jury would not miss it . " He says he always turned his head when he 's frisked , " said Bloch . The court sustained an objection when Bloch attempted to pursue this line of questioning . Bloch and Romano have attempted to create the impression that the three young men were unsavory characters interested in the dope racket . At one time Monaco stepped down to show Bloch how Moretti was standing in the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration was made on the replica set up in the courtroom . Monaco placed his left hand on top of the back of the seat . He had already testified on direct examination that the policeman 's hand was below the top of the seat and invisible to him where he was sitting in the back seat. , One or Two Guns ? The prosecution is hopeful the jury will believe Moretti had a gun in each hand when he opened the door of the car . Moretti 's , story is that he had one gun in his right hand and that he grabbed a gun from Salvi after Salvi , seat ' ed in front , fired at the policeman . Bloch , apparently hoping to emphasize that Monaco could see Moretti 's left hand and that it did not hold a gun , asked Monaco to demonstrate the policeman 's position a second time , This time Monaco kept his left hand below the seat so it was invisible from the rear . Testimony about the significance of the amount of alcohol found in Salvi 's blood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's toxicologist . He said that in his opinion the alcoholic content of the two blood samples would not produce intoxication . Expert Witnesses Disagree At Thursday 's session , Dr. Augustus C. Webb , coroner 's physician . testified that a sample of Gamino 's blood contained 70.3 milligrams per cent of alcohol 70.3 parts alcohol , in 100,000 parts of the sample . Salvi 's blood , he said , had 665 milligrams per cent . Dr. Webb had said this would indicate to hint that the two were intoxicated . Dr. Camp said it would take at least 150 milligrams per cent of alcohol to produce intoxication . Monaco had testified that Salvi was sober .
