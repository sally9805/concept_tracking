TV last week showed early foot , then fell off the pace , finally closed strong . It was away from the post with The Taming of the Shrew , a brisk Shakespearean gallop which showed Maurice Evans at the top of his form as the impetuous Petruchio . while Lilli Palmer gave smouldering life to the imperious Kate . Staged with wit and imagination by The Hit Parade 's William Nichols and costumed brilliantly by Rouben Ter-Arutunian , Shrew was one of the best of Maurice Evans ' productions . <P> ABC lapsed from its usual pattern of filmed shows to try a live hour-long Spectacular , Springtime , U.S.A. It is a Broadway truism that Helen Hayes is so gifted that she could even make the reading of the Manhattan phone book an exciting experience . ABC confounded Broadway and Helen by handing her a script as heavy as the phone book and twice as dull . <P> A flag-waving salute to America past and present . Springtime was also bedeviled by flubs , as when the actor playing George Washington proudly announced the surrender of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to ignore the script , there was some reward in the singing of Patrice Munsel and Rise Stevens and in Paul Whiteman 's conducting of Gershwin 's Rhapsody in Blue . <P> Armstrong Circle Theater created some excitement with Five Who Shook the Mighty , a sympathetic rendering of last year 's capture of the Red Rumanian legation in Bern . Switzerland , by a band of anti-Communist exiles . Although taking considerable dramatic license with the facts ( e.g. , the Red charge d'affaires , played by Gregory Morton , is shown as a captive , but actually escaped ) , the play had far more realism and bite than the usual run of TV 's anti-Communist dramas . Climax ! failed with its version of Katherine Anne Porter 's 1939 novel . Pale Horse , Pale Rider , a story of love and loss in World War I. Dorothy McGuire , looking at moments remarkably like Grace Kelly , flung herself into the role of the lovelorn girl with more abandon than heartbreak , and John Forsythe as her man had the air of a man looking desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up again with a battery of good shows . Camera Three dealt sensitively with the imagist poetry of Dylan Thomas ; Omnibus approached the end of its best TV season with a technically superb visit to Harvard University that featured a strong supporting cast of such alumni as Massachusetts ' U.S. Senators Leverett Saltonstall and John Kennedy , Johns Hopkins ' Vice President Dr. Barry Wood , and Composer Leonard Bernstein . Later Max Liebman contributed another of his spectaculars , Heaven Will Protect the Working Girl : it had a fine satiric idea ( U.S. career girls , past and present ) , a talented cast ( Bert Lahr , Nancy Walker , Helen Gallagher , Tammy Grimes . Janet Blair ) but an often hackneyed script .
