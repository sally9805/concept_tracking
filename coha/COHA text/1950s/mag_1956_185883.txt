When her husband died eleven months ago , Mrs. Charles Ulrick Bay , widow of the former U.S. Ambassador to Norway , found herself with 71% of the stock in Wall Street 's venerable ( since 1865 ) brokerage firm of A. M. Kidder &; Co . Inc . But the New York Stock Exchange requires , in effect , that a stockholder who owns more than 45% of a member company 's shares must either 1 ) sell the stock , or 2 ) take an active part in the firm . Since she always had an active interest in her husband 's business and philanthropic dealings , Mrs. Bay had no trouble making her choice . This week , at 56 , she becomes Kidder 's board chairman and president , the first woman to hold such posts in the Stock Exchange 's 164-year history . <P> <P> Broker Bay has other substantial holdings , including a controlling interest ( 282,000 out of the 1,200,000 shares ) in American Export Lines , where she is chairman of the executive committee . " After my husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit back and cut coupons . I like a man 's world . " She also finds time to care for three adopted Norwegian children , try new recipes ( out of 50 cookbooks ) , follow the fortunes of a stable of racing thoroughbreds , sail a 12-meter racing yacht , oversee a score of philanthropies ( brain tumor , cerebral palsy , other medical research ) . Since women control an increasing amount of the nation 's wealth , says Mrs. Bay , she feels that they ought to take a greater part in the financial world . Says she : " Times have really changed on Wall Street . I 'm the first woman who has ever done this . Why not others ? "
