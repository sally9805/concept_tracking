" Personally , I think Sid Caesar is the greatest , but ... " The line has been echoing all season in Radio City and on Madison Avenue , in the top-level shoptalk about NBC 's Saturday night Caesar 's Hour , TV 's best comedy show . TV bigwigs have not let their tribute to Caesar keep them from rendering unto the sponsor what is the sponsor 's : the right to expect that so costly a show ( $223,000 a week , including time charges ) will pay off in a far bigger audience than its sagging ratings have reflected . Last week Caesar and NBC announced that his nine-year reign on the network will end with this week 's show . <P> The end of Caesar 's reign also closes a TV era in which the comedian was king , and leaves supremacy to a new breed of blander favorites-the Perry Comos , the Lawrence Welks. the Tennessee Ernie Fords ( see below ) . Almost all the comics have surrendered or compromised in the face of TV 's terrible challenge of keeping both material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackie Gleason will take a sabbatical , and NBC 's George Gobel will try to salvage his popularity by cutting down his exposure . Such perennials as Bob Hope , Jack Benny and Burns &; Allen have taken refuge in limited appearances or filmed situation comedies that produce greater mileage for less material . Next season Red Skelton 's half-hour CBS program will be the only full-fledged weekly live appearance by a network comedian . <P> No comedian , even the TV Pleistocene Age 's Milton Berle , has matched Sid Caesar 's staying power or his grip on the loyalty of hard-core fans . More than that , by common show-business consent , he is one of the truly great clowns . Apart from sheer technical mastery of pantomime , dialect , timing and the ad lib , Caesar has a creative gift for spoofing the stuffy and the phony and for finding endless fun in universal human foibles and frustrations . His career , which began as a $10-a-week saxophonist on New York 's borsch circuit , has made him a millionaire . It has brought him a $100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a duplex Manhattan penthouse office suite that boasts a rehearsal hall and a Rouault ; seven years of psychoanalysis , and such possessions as 50 broad-shouldered suits , a $4,000 **25;11621;TOOLONG ring and a solid gold lighter for his long , fat cigars . The last time he was on somebody else 's payroll ( in 1954 when he split with Imogene Coca and Producer Max Your Show of Shows Liebman ) he earned $25,000 a week . Since then , as his own producer with a payroll of 60-odd employees and other show costs , 34-year-old , Yonkers-born Caesar has been collecting $106,000 for each show .
