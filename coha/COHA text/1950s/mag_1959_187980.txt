THIRTEEN years ago the U.S. was at the peak of history 's biggest demobilization of armed men . In a twelve-month period , no fewer than 10 million soldiers , sailors and marines charged through U.S. discharge centers , gleefully but uncertainly eyed themselves in civvies ( which seemed ungainly , loose ) and tried to pick up the tricky cadence of life in a competitive society . The homecoming was fraught with misgivings : never before had so many been away from normal life for so long . Could they ever catch up ? Could they ever repair their " interrupted lives " ? <P> Economist Sumner Slichter wrote that " in the opinion of many persons " millions ( perhaps 8,000,000 ) would find no jobs in an economy which , like the service veterans , had to reconvert to peacetime production . Afraid that federal subsidies would lure idle vets to campus , the University of Chicago 's Robert M. Hutchins warned that vets would breed " educational hobo jungles . " Sociologist Willard Waller , recalling that World War I Veterans Hitler and Mussolini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written many a bloody page of history , and those pages have stood forever as a record of their days of anger . " <P> By now , 15.3 million veterans of World War II , followed by 4,500,000 from Korea , have gone back into civilian life with hardly a ripple . They have , in fact , become the main stream , in many ways changing the course of U.S. life itself . Though only one in ten ever traded fire with the enemy , most grew to understand men and machines , brought back technical and supervisory proficiency that encouraged and staffed the postwar technological revolution-from TV repair shop to nuclear lab , from farm to Ford Motor Co . They coupled a broadened outlook with a conservative , down-to-earth manner that is reflected in the nation 's growing calmness before cold-war threats . Many absorbed a sense of order , organization and responsibility that became the lifeblood of corporations , unions , colleges , etc . <P> Now an average 40 years of age , they are moving front and center to key posts of their companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potter Stewart , 43 , a lieutenant aboard a Navy tanker in the North African invasion , became the World War II vets ' third U.S. Supreme Court Justice , after Brennan and Harlan . ( On the bench they sit with five veterans of World War I : eight of the nine Justices have seen wartime military service . ) <P> Bonus in Advance
