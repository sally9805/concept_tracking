The most cheerful thing about last week 's All-Star Game in Milwaukee was the city of Milwaukee itself . The city named each year as the site of baseball 's big game is chosen according to a rather ramshackle order of succession and not , usually , for any particular merit in the actual year of selection . Baseball players are chosen that way , but not cities . Nevertheless , Milwaukee managed to convey the impression that it was picked as host for this year 's All-Star Game because it was , on its record , the best of all possible choices for the honor . // For Milwaukee is a baseball town , by far the best in the major leagues . Baseball there is part of the civic personality , just as theaters are in New York , and motion pictures are in Los Angeles and culture used to be in Boston . It 's as personal a part of the town as beer , and the Milwaukee Braves are , with the breweries , part of Milwaukee 's civic pride . // Milwaukeeans do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fond of them . And there are some things that ring of midsummer madness : a fan or two with a clanking cowbell or a shrieking siren , an occasional automobile with " Milwaukee Braves " written in reflecting tape across the bumper , an advertisement in a gasoline station with a postscript : " Go get ' em , Braves ! " There is also at least one big welcome-to-the-city sign that refers to Milwaukee as " the land of the free and the home of the Braves . " // But this is just fun . Under it and over it and beyond it is the impressive fact that everywhere you go people talk baseball . Baseball , like the weather , is part of the atmosphere . It serves to make going to a baseball game a real pleasure . // You could feel this in County Stadium during the All-Star Game . There was red-white-and-blue bunting on the fences , and a band playing , and hundreds of reporters and photographers assembled from all over the country . Here and there were celebrities hanging on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first game of a World Series , but with one major exception : the crowd knew its baseball . // You know how a World Series crowd is . Tickets seem to find their way into special hands . Many of the people who end up at the game are pleasant enough , but they tend to be sedate and neither knowing nor excited . They act as if all this were interesting and probably important , but they never seem quite sure what to cheer for . // Well , at Milwaukee last week the crowd was pleasant enough too , but it was not sedate ( it was loudly pro-National League and anti-Baseball Writer , particularly those writers who were blocking the view of home plate during batting practice ) . It knew precisely what to cheer for and did so vigorously . You 've probably heard that Milwaukee crowds are " Ladies Day crowds , " meaning that they 'll cheer wildly and indiscriminately at anything , even foul balls . Do n't be misled . This crowd yelled with unrestrained enthusiasm but , except for some disproportionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right places and for the right things . It was a knowing , enthusiastic baseball crowd and it certainly helped to make the game the success it was . // Perhaps it was the crowd that was responsible for another cheerful thing : the fun the players themselves seemed to get out of the game . Many respected authorities , including our own Red Smith ( SI , July 11 ) , hold to a theory that the All-Star Game is a dreary duty for everybody but the fans , that the ballplayers just go through the motions and ca n't wait for the thing to be over . This has been true in the past and may be true again in the future , but it was n't last week . // " I tell you , they were like college kids , " Leo Durocher said in the clubhouse after the game . " Yelling and jumping up and down the bench . They wanted to win . They were n't fooling around . " He spoke for the National League , but the American League was equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around before the game like the small boy he always seems to be when he has a bat in his hands . When he was n't hitting in batting practice himself he was watching others hit , never missing a thing . Surrounded by reporters , holding six conversations at once , Williams moved his head like an ever-alert bird , here , there , everywhere , talking , smiling , nodding , but always , whenever the batting-practice pitcher threw and the ball approached the plate , turning to watch the batter follow through on his swing . // He batted against Steve Gromek in practice , with poor success . // " Man , I never could hit him ! " he growled . He paced around behind the batting cage and glinted his eyes in at broad young Mickey Mantle . Mantle fouled one into the dirt . // " He 's tough to hit , hey , Mick ! " Williams gibed. // Mantle swung again and drove the ball high and far into the right-field seats . He came out of the cage and walked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Williams like a little boy at his big brother and smiled cockily . Williams grinned . Later , in the first inning , after Mantle had hit his immensely high and long home run over the center-field fence , Williams , who had been on base , waited for him and gave him a delighted little poke in the ribs , as if to say that 's the way to do it ! // When Stan Musial hit his game-winning home run in the 12th inning Willie Mays , who was waiting to bat next , went high on his toes in anticipation as the ball sailed towards the fence . When it cleared it he gave a little leap and then turned to greet Musial at the plate . The rest of the National League players flowed off the bench and up to the plate to join him . Leo Durocher leaned way over until his face was only inches from the ground , watching home plate intently until Musial , his quiet face split into a great , wide smile , stepped on it . Musial was surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and escorted gaily off the field . // Willie Mays , who seemed just a little disappointed at the loss of another turn at bat , followed wistfully behind . Don Newcombe , the Brooklyn Dodger pitcher who had worked the seventh inning for the National League and who had since showered and was now dressed in slacks and a sport jacket , put a huge arm around Willie , hugged him and ran with him after the crowd . // Inside the clubhouse , as they dressed slowly after the initial excitement had died down , the players rehashed the high points of the game : Mantle 's homer , Musial 's homer , Pierce 's pitching , Nuxhall 's pitching , Conley 's pitching , Kluszewski 's fine all-round play , Mays 's catch , Schoendienst 's great play on Berra. // Schoendienst , listening to the talk , said to Gil Hodges , " Why ca n't we have a team like this in the league ? " // Hodges smiled quietly . // " Boy , if we did , I 'd sure like to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
