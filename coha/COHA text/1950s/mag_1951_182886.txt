When scholarly , bush-haired Harold Walter Stoke took over as president of Louisiana State University in 1947 , he came as a man with a mission : he wanted to raise L.S.U. 's academic reputation to the level of the lavish $41 million campus that Huey Long had helped to build . For a while , it seemed as if he might succeed in doing just that ( TIME , May 9 , 1949 ) . <P> But in 3-3-years , Harold Stoke found that his reforms did not always win applause . From the start , he aroused some of his deans by taking away their arbitrary right to hire &; fire faculty members , and by giving the faculty a louder voice in university affairs . Some Louisianans disliked him because he was a Yankee ( his last job : president of the University of New Hampshire ) , and because he tried to hire professors from outside the state . <P> In trying to rid L.S.U. of what he called its " candy and cake " atmosphere , President Stoke found himself bogged down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus traffic regulations and cutting down the number and speed of student convertibles ( " We must decide whether we want to be a university or a country club " ) . He fought with Athletic Director T. P. ( " Red " ) Heard , who wanted to enlarge the football stadium , while Stoke aimed to put football in its place as " just another university activity . " <P> Last week Harold Stoke , at the end of a failing mission , announced that he was fed up , would resign as of Feb. 1 . With brisk efficiency , the board of supervisors picked a new president : Mississippi-born Lieut . General Troy H. Middleton , 61 , able wartime commander of the VIII Army Corps in Europe , since 1939 ( with time out for war service ) L.S.U 's comptroller . Harold Stoke 's new mission : to take " some time out for battle fatigue , " then look for another job .
