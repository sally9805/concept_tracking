txt A great university celebrated the other day its anniversary and many words were uttered of praise , of hope of increasing knowledge and of the part such higher institutions must play if education is to serve free men . But no one , we think , put it quite an well as Dr. Grayson Kirk , the president of Columbia University , when he said : " We must maintain the greatest possible opportunities for the free clash of opinions on all subjects , trusting th. innate good judgment of men and %. - omen to reach decisions that are beneficial to society . " The ends of education are not the learning by rote of knowledge already established , but the testing of that knowledge and the extension of it into new learning . It was no discovery of new knowledge that gave Archimedes the way to test the purity of Hiero 's crown , but the application of knowledge he possessed already . Just so when the apple dropped onto Sir Isaac Newton 's head it provided him with a clue to extended knowledge useful only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple was a lever to further knowledge . The purpose of education is therefore to test one idea against another idea , one method against another method , to inquire into and to examine until men can know the true from the false . Most of the great educators know that to fail the test of full inquiry end examination is to become an advocate and thus no longer a true educator , and that to so fail leads to inquiry into what is being advocated and by whom and for what purpose . This is , and should be , the responsibility of the educators themselves . And we know of none who , in meeting that responsibility , believes that there is any place in education for those who advocate a system that plans to overthrow the government by force or violence , or of a dogma that abolishes free inquiry itself . But because these dogmas and systems do exist and do threaten our government , others than educators inquire into what colleges and universities teach . This in turn leads educators to express fears that are magnified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole educational system is under attack . This is not so but neither is the saying of these things new . Nor should they be disproportionately feared . We have only to point out that Columbia University the other day was 200 years old .
