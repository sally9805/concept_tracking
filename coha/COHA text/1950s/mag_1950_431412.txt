 | Do You Know What 's Been Happening South of the Border JUST SOUTH of Monterrey , Mexico , nine shining college buildings stand on a landscaped campus that only recently was a rocky goat pasture . This is Monterrey Institute of Technology where 1400 youths are becoming the engineers and technicians needed by Mexican industries that have doubled in number since 194.0 . Tourists over the nearby Pan-American Highway should give the place a long thought as well as a quick look . A decade ago , few young Mexicans got such education , and they went abroad for it . The Tecnologico , built by Monterrey capital , is a $2,500,000 symbol of an industrial-social revolution that is remaking Latin America from Mexico to the tip of Chile . In ten years of reporting its affairs , I have seen the whole region surge forward until today it is the most rapidly developing quarter of the globe . The . impetus of wartime necessity and postwar opportunity has transformed whole nations . Levels of health and education are rising . New categories of skilled workers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landowners and an impoverished peasant mass is crumbling before a complex modern society in which a growing , potent middle class lessens the gap between rich and poor . A spirit of optimism and imagination is leading men like those of Monterrey into ventures for the common good . All this can mean the building of strong modern nations and a further shifting of world power to our side of the Atlantic . An ambitious , homeowning middle class and better-fed laborers mean stronger bulwarks against Communism , which thrives on mass poverty . To see this phenomenon clearly ,  | look at a map and imagine yourself flying southward from Texas : Veining Mexico 's mountain maze are 10,000 miles of new highways . Irrigation has turned 12 million desert acres into croplands . Industrialization has all but engulfed old Mexico City with skyscrapers , miles of new apartments , manufacturing plants , workers ' suburbs ; its population has shot up by one million since 1940 . On the Gulf , near the Veracruz coast , a primitive area larger than Holland is being remade by four huge dams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1954 , this tropical TVA will produce more power than all Mexico used ten years ago . In this decade the Central American lands ? Guatemala , El Salvador , Honduras , Nicaragua , Costa Rica , Panama ? have made more progress toward becoming healthy , prosperous farming countries than in the ' previous century . The first highway to link them is , except for two short gaps , in daily use . Airliners whip from one capital to the next . The menace of malaria , which once sapped the vitality of six persons in ten , has been cut as much as 8o percent by modern spraying , drainage and medical techniques . Scores of towns have reduced dysentery and typhoid rates as dramatically . Two new centers here are spreading an agricultural revolution . At the United Fruit Company 's big school in Honduras the brightest teen-age farm boys from a dozer tropical countries are given , free , liberal education and the finest agricultural training . After three years they go home with but one obligation to set an example to their neighbors . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for centuries relied on the ox-drawn plow . In Costa Rica , the InterAmerican Institute of Agricultural Sciences farms , experimentally , the most potent 3000 acres in the Americas . Supported by ten countries , the Institute is a research center developing new crops , breeding better cattle and solving soil problems for all tropical America . It is also a postgraduate school turning 50 young Latins a year into agricultural scientists of the highest caliber . That tropical boomland , Venezuela , is the world 's second oil producer . But oil is not all . Two U. S. companies are making vast investments in its fabulous iron deposits . With an income of $500,000 a day from oil alone , Venezuela is pushing a huge public-health and school-building program , driving highways deep into the interior , planting remote colonies of DPs and natives to boost food production . More than 1oo,000 European refugees have found homes here . In 1940 Caracas , the capital , was a drowsing town of 150,000 , hardly changed since 184o . Today  --  three times as large and transformed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern base for the building of a modern nation . Condensed from La Prensa Michael Scully  | Next-door Colombia is nearly twice the size of Texas and potentially as rich with its mineral wealth , power sources , world 's finest coffee slopes , fertile valleys and great cattle lands . Modern transport , much of it by air , has helped to remake Bogota , the capital , and turned Medellin from an isolated coffee and mining town into a model industrial city . In the newly opened ranchlands east of the Andes , packing plants are planned from which meat will be flown to the outside world . Peru , with its dramatic mountains , ancient cities and Indian civilization , is the prototype of travelposter countries . But if you expect nothing more , you 'll be amazed . Two modern ports , at Chimbote and T'lollendo , have been built since 1940 . Inland from Chimbote , a tunnel bored for five miles through a mountain diverts the Santa River , dropping the water 1400 feet to provide power for industry and irrigation for a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one man 's initiative . Five years ago Fcfrnando Belaunde , a young architect , found workers in a new factory district living in squalid , disease-breeding shack-towns . At his suggestion a housing corporation was financed almost entirely by the sale of low-interest bonds to employers . Public-spirited architects working at nominal fees created a model apartment colony of 55 buildings housing 6000 people ? highest rental , $16 a month . With its own park and playgrounds , shops , church , schools and post office , this colony is the first of 15 that are growing from Belaunde 's idea . You will see the most intensive transformation in South America along the half-bleak , half-beautiful length of Chile . Four rivers have been harnessed with power plants , the first of two new rail links with Argentina has been built , a $90,000 , - 000 steel mill was opened recently , a rich oil field has been discovered . Forest and fishing industries , equal in resources to those of Scandinavia , are being developed . The hemisphere 's most thrilling flight is over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America 's greatest mountain , just ' off your wingtip . When you learn that the topsoil of the vast pampas stretching below you is ten feet deep , you understand how meat and grain of this area ? the richest on earth ? enabled the Argentines to bank two billion dollars in profits , during the war . Buenos Aires : More than three million people live in this greatest city south of the equator , third only to New York and Chicago on the hemisphere . You land at Ezeiza , perhaps the most modern airport in use today . This is no simple terminal , but an air-age resort suburb that , with $6o,000,000 already invested , will cover 25 square miles when completed . Three swimming pools take up 3o acres . Here are hotels , amusement centers , model villages . In 25 minutes you will be whisked over 20 miles of superhighway to Buenos  | Aires ? with shining new factories on every hand . Buenos Aires has the hemisphere 's widest avenue ( 400 feet ) , covering blocks of underground parking space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's seem obsolete . Calk Lavalle is as bright as Broadway , with theaters set door-todoor for blocks ; Calle Florida is packed with luxury shops second only to Fifth Avenue 's . The waterfront is home port of a merchant fleet that has grown from 45 to more than 200 vessels in ten years . Down the river there 's little Uruguay , most valiantly democratic of South American lands , with its rich , rolling cattle lands and magnificent beach resorts . It has doubled its electrical power by harnessing the Rio Negro and is making more of its household wares , food products , clothing and other essentials . Now northward to Brazil . Here is man 's great opportunity to build a major civilization in the tropics , and the Brazilians are finally doing just that . To gauge Brazil 's new power , you must see Sao Paulo , an industrial dynamo of a town which has doubled all statistics in a decade . Population is up to two million , production to one and a half billion dollars a year . Among thousands of factories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Ford , General Motors , International Harvester ; as many more represent European interests . Foreign capital and immigration from almost every European country has made it South America 's only true cosmopolis , a world city resembling New York both in the fusion of races and its influence on its country . The new architecture of Rio de Janeiro not a few buildings , but miles of them ? is probably the finest mass of modern design in the world . In the heart of the city a square mile of granite hill was blasted to earth , and debris dumped into the bay , to form the site for the ultramodern Santos Dumont airport . Of Brazil 's 50 million people , 8o percent still cling to the coast . But the " March West " has begun over a huge front . The conquest of the hinterland promises Brazil an adequate , balanced food supply for the first time in recent history . In this quick tour I have skipped some countries and I have cited only examples of change . There are a half dozen technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great TVA-like project in the Sao Francisco valley will equal Mexico 's at Veracruz . Lima 's low-cost housing program is matched , although with public funds , in Mexico City , Panama City , Caracas , Buenos Aires . The growth of Argentina 's merchant marine is paralleled by that of Brazil . The picture is not all bright . The badly housed , ill-clothed and underfed are still far more numerous than those who have benefited . Millions are still untouched by health programs . One half of the people are still illiterate . Vast numbers of exploited Indians and peons remain .  | You will continue to read of political and economic crises . But the important point is that a , great historic upturn has come . Just as conditions impelled our own expansion iii the 1800 's , conditions today have given Latin America the facilities and momentum for solving its problems and moving abreast of the modern world . To the United States , this means more trade , of course . Excepting Canada , the southern countries are our best market and the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winch had about 1oo,000'motor vehicles in 1940 , has almost 300,000 on its new roads today ; Brazil bought 50,000 trucks for $ioo , 000 , - 000 in a single deal and Argentina spent $22,000,000 for 90 Diesel locomotives . Farm and road and hydroelectric machinery bought by Latin America translates into jobs in Pittsburgh , Detroit , Youngstown , New Orleans . But Latin America 's upsurge means something infinitely more valuable than dollars . industrialization has set up a powerful counterforce to the feudal system which for centuries has been a drag against progress . New enterprises need highly paid technicians , educated clerical staffs , literate skilled workers . The productivity of these creates new means of livelihood for thousands of professional men , merchants , clerks , for transport and construction workers , all of whom are independent ? economically , hence politically  --  of the old order . A healthy , potent class of thinking voters ? and a big political balance ? is being created for the first time . This influence extends to the hinterlands . Masses of farm workers are going into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Result : Farm hands are receiving increased pay , getting better housing . Many are rising from the status of peon to that of tenant farmer , some are becoming small landowners . Here is the most important result of the quickening pulse-beat in Latin America ? the growth of a vigorous , informed middle class with the ambition and the opportunity to improve its lot , to educate its children , to own its piece of earth . It is on the broad base of such people that strong democracies are built . When tiny El Salvador recently decided to build a $17,500,000 hydroelectric system , the International Bank agreed to lend it $12,500,000 if Salvador would raise the other $5,000,000 by a bond issue . As an experiment , only $400,000 of the bonds was allotted to the wealthy men of the country . The rest were put on public sale . Within a week the issue was oversubscribed by people of small and modest incomes who had savings , ambition and faith in their country 's future . The impact of this new middle class is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars of the 182o's.
