THE SELECTED LETTERS OF ANTON CHEKHOV ( 331 pp. ) - Edited by Lillian Hellman-Farrar , Straus ( $4 ) . <P> " Why do you always wear black ? " " I am in mourning for my life . I am unhappy . " <P> - The Seagull <P> The Anton Chekhov of the Selected Letters wears his rue with a difference : it is not black , only charcoal grey . No one mocked his low spirits more high-spiritedly than Chekhov . While he put his genius into his short stories and plays , he put his complaints into his letters . But deftly introduced and edited by Playwright Lillian Hellman , Letter-Writer Chekhov emerges as a sweet , kind and amiable grouch , and his correspondence as a thoroughly engaging testimonial to the power of negative thinking . <P> Noah Had Three Sons . In 1880 young Anton was 20 and all but the sole support of a threadbare clan of eight . His grocer father was too broke to keep his family in staples . His two older brothers were swaggering Moscow bohemians . No prig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk all the time that I took bottles for girls , and girls for bottles . " <P> Chekhov put himself through medical school , but he was a doctor only by chance and a writing man out of inner necessity . Before he was 30 he had churned out some 400 stories , sketches and one-act plays , and the first version of Uncle Vanya . He believed that a writer had to be an irritated oyster before he would produce any pearls : " He who does n't desire anything , does n't hope for anything and is n't afraid of anything can not be an artist . " Damning his own as a literary generation of " lemonade " dispensers , Chekhov makes a telling diagnosis of Chekhov : " We paint life such as it is-that 's all , there is n't any more . . . We have no politics , we do n't believe in revolution , we do n't believe in God , we are n't afraid of ghosts , and personally I do n't even fear death or blindness . " <P> His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its model , life . " Noah had three sons , Shem , Ham and , I think , Japheth . The only thing Ham noted was that his father was a drunkard ; he completely lost sight of the fact that Noah was a genius , that he built an ark and saved the world . Writing people ought not imitate Ham . " <P> Portable Sickroom . To avoid Hamyopia , Chekhov traveled widely . But the Russian hinterland rarely sent Chekhov into those flights of mystic brotherhood common to 19th century Russian intellectuals . He approached it with a clothespin ever ready to clamp to his nose , as when he described a provincial sausage : " The odor was as if you had entered a stable at the moment the coachman was unwinding his leg puttees ; when you started chewing the stuff you experienced a sensation like sinking your teeth into a tar-smeared dog 's tail . " Yet he spent a heroic overworked year heading off a cholera epidemic in a west Russia country district , all the while grumping unheroically.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
