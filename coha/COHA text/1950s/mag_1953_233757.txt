I Am a Camera <P> Sir : I was delighted to find my portrait , done under the skillful brush of Artzybasheff , on the cover of TIME , Nov. 2 . It was an abstract rather than realistic portrait , of course ; for clear realism would have shown an Omnica bag , Norwood light meter , Exakta VX , and three photo-all lenses with including travel a stains from being logged 95,000 miles through twelve countries and four Pacific islands . But as a symbolic portrait it was superb . . . W. NORWOOD BRIGANCE Crawfordsville , Ind . <P> Sir : Your story features the progress of U.S. photography . Is it significant that the cover is a painting of things photographic rather than a photograph of same ? <P> BART . A. GREENE Riverdale , N.Y . <P> Sir : Again Artzybasheff seems to show us to ourselves , his myopically candid-eyed character beautifully portraying the recent , rather revolting development within our ranks . . . of a whole group of souls who do n't know what they 've been looking at until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but so frequently met guy who 'll " tell you about my vacation when the prints are developed .

There were the usual fenced-off views . . . and each time as we obediently halted to look , we met the same happy couple , simple tourists like ourselves , but with movie camera attached . Roaring into the parking spot , they slammed to a halt , leaped out , and whirrilling like some great electronic brain , focused their mechanical eye . . . Then , whoosh ! - into the car and off , one driving alone with an eye for the next stop , the other busily twiddling gadgets and sorting film . . . Granted that picture-taking is fun and that pictures are nice . . . good heavens ! Let us remember to look around our camera lens occasionally and see something ourselves . . . <P> JACQUELINE GOODCHILDS Ithaca , N.Y . <P> Sir : The article saluting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken root in America . Retrospectively , while a half century ago photography was little more one than a curiosity , its society was contemplating converting itself into a bicycle club . I wish to thank the editors of TIME for the comprehensive review . . . The title and " Two that Billion pictures Clicks " points to the amateur photographer in a crowning report on the camera subject and an inclusive history of the medium . <P> T. Anthony Caruso Curator of Photography The Brooklyn Museum Brooklyn <P> Atlantic Schism ( Cont 'd ) <P> Sir : Fair-minded TIME-readers , rereading my Oct. 12 article and Malcolm Muggeridge 's reply Nov. 2 , may note that his is much more general ( and rhetorical ) , mine more specific . He answers few of my concrete arguments . He does n't even say if he agrees with the British or the American view on recognition of Peking , but he seems to accept the American view . If so , he is to that extent less representative than I of British opinion - though TIME , correctly , did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole .
