If anyone wants to build a low-power nuclear reactor , the Atomic Energy Commission will tell him how . Last week the AEC , jointly with Britain and Canada , announced a new " Declassification Guide , " which permits the release of such information . Still restricted , of course , is information about large-scale reactors ( which make plutonium ) and about atomic weapons themselves . <P> " The three governments , " said the AEC , " have determined that the release of information . . . will speed the training of nuclear reactor engineers and technicians and will hasten atomic energy development in these countries , particularly for peacetime applications . It was determined that this information would not aid rival nations in the development of military applications of atomic energy . Low-power research reactors can not be used for producing atomic weapons or power . " <P> The data released will not be up to date . The newest reactor to be described in detail is HYPO ( for High Power ) , the Los Alamos " Water Boiler " which went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fissioned since then . In the guarded centers of the AEC 's " technical areas " are more advanced reactors . But HYPO is effective enough , comparatively cheap and simple . <P> Its essential part is a spherical stainless steel tank one foot in diameter . Inside is a water solution of uranyl nitrate which contains 1.9 lb. of fissionable U-235 . Water running through a coiled tube keeps the reactor cool , and another tube piercing the sphere gives access to its interior . One big advantage of HYPO is that it is self-regulating . If the chain reaction gets going too fast , the solution heats up and expands , reducing its density and therefore its reactivity . So the reaction slows down automatically until the solution has cooled off . This built-in stability makes HYPO a safe and easy basic trainer for future atomic engineers .
