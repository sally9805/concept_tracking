Lurking among the flowers and vegetables in many a South African garden patch is an innocent-looking weed called dagga . Dried and smoked like marijuana , a close relative , it induces a dreamy recklessness that can spur men to acts of terrible savagery . Nearly one-fourth of the rapes , murders and maulings that occur in the slums of South Africa 's great cities are blamed on dagga . <P> The illicit dagga traffic has been on the rise recently , and local police have long suspected the existence of some great new source of the drug . On patrol of the foothills lying beneath the great , rugged Drakensberg Mountains a fortnight ago , a party of seven policemen discovered one such source-a vast valley planted solidly with the grey-green weed . They sent a messenger to the nearest police station to report their find , then began tearing out the plants one by one . Suddenly from the mountain above there came a fierce Zulu battle cry . Down the hill raced a horde of black savages , maddened with the drug and furiously waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . The other two escaped badly battered after a three-hour chase . <P> By the time reinforcements arrived , the Zulu dagga planters had fled to the impenetrable , distant mountains . Unable to pursue them , police returned to the dagga valley with a fleet of trucks . At week 's end they had harvested and destroyed close to 200 tons of deathly dagga.
