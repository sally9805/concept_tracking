Edouard Fankhauser , president of the Swiss Nudist Club , regards the Helsinki Olympics as a " travesty . " Said he last week : " The ancient athletes performed in the nude . . . It would be so much better if the youth of the world . . . remained faithful to the old ideals . " So saying , Nudist Fankhauser stepped back inside the barb-wired camp on the shore of Switzerland 's Lake of Neuchatel , where some 50 naked men &; women from six European countries were competing in " the real Olympiad . " U.S. nudists ( TIME , Aug. 25 ) were invited , but decided not to take off for Europe . <P> Barred spectators , shivering in a cold rain , tried to follow events with binoculars from distant trees , but caught only glimpses of the sniffly athletes as they jounced and bounced through shoeless track and field contests . The peekers noted that even bathing caps were ruled out of the 50-yd. breaststroke event . But until President Fankhauser saw fit to announce the results , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even programs would help , because it was difficult to tell one unnumbered performer from another .
