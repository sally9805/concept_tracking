In the state where it was hatched , the Charter of the United Nations fluttered home to roost last week . A California court of appeals used it to throw out a California law . The opinion , if upheld , might scatter confusion through the laws of the 48 states . <P> The opinion was delivered in the case of Sei Fujii , a sad-faced little Japanese who had bought a piece of Los Angeles real estate , but could not get legal title because of California 's Alien Land Act . Under the act-which has been regularly attacked and just as regularly upheld by both state and federal courts for almost 30 years-aliens who are ineligible for citizenship may not own California land . Los Angeles Attorney J. Marion Wright argued that the Alien Land Act conflicted with the Charter of the U.N . The three appeals judges pondered , and decided , in fact , that Wright was right . <P> Wrote Judge Emmett Wilson in the court 's opinion : " The position of this country in the family of nations . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the U.N. Charter according to its plain language . " In plain language the Charter declares it the intention of the U.N . " to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights " and pledges all the signers to respect such rights " without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion . " <P> The Charter ( the judges argued ) , like any other treaty made by the U.S. , has become " the supreme law of the land . . . paramount to every law of every state in conflict with it . The Alien Land law must therefore yield to the treaty as the superior authority . . . "
