Emanuel Swedenborg was a physicist ; in 1716 King Charles XII of Sweden appointed him assessor-extraordinary to the Royal Board of Mines . He was also perhaps the most versatile genius-of-all-trades since Leonardo da Vinci . <P> For the Swedish army he devised a method of transporting ships overland . <P> He drew plans for a one-man submarine and a " flying carriage . " In Sweden 's House of Nobles he spoke brilliantly in favor of trade , liquor-control laws , and the decimal system . He was a physicist who anticipated Kant and Laplace in the nebular hypothesis , and a paleontologist far ahead of his time . His contributions to science included a modern theory of molecular magnetics , a system of crystallography , a mercury air pump , and a method of determining longitude at sea from the moon . <P> As a physiologist , he made many discoveries , including an anticipation of the functions of the ductless glands . <P> Then , one April night in 1744 , when he was 56 years old , he had a vision of Christ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Extrasensory Perception . In a series of writings that now add up to some 30 heavy volumes ( some of them in " automatic writing " dictated to him , as he believed , from the spirit world ) , he evolved a new Christian theology centered in a merging of the orthodox Trinity into Lord Jesus Christ and the belief that the Christ 's Second Coming had already occurred-in the form of the Word , revealed to Emanuel Swedenborg . The afterlife and spirit world were as real to the new Swedenborg as his native Stockholm . He made Sweden 's Queen Louisa Ulrica blanch with a secret message from her deceased brother , and he titillated his contemporaries with reports of new marriages made in heaven between noted persons long dead . <P> Clairvoyance was another talent of Swedenborg 's . It has led Duke University 's famed Extrasensory Perceptionist Joseph B. Rhine to call him " the pioneer in the work I am doing . " At about 6 o'clock one night in 1759 , Swedenborg , who was visiting a friend in- Goteborg , suddenly turned pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Stockholm , 325 miles away , and as it spread , he gave out bulletins like a mental radio station . <P> The house of one of his friends was already in ashes , he reported , and his own was threatened . At 8 o'clock he exclaimed : " Thank God ! The fire is extinguished , the third door from my house . " Two days later a messenger arrived from Stockholm , confirming all details . <P> " A Colossal Soul . " At Swedenborg 's death , in 1772 , there were no plans to form an association of his followers . But 16 years later a group of British Sweden-borgians formed the first Church of the New Jerusalem at Great Eastcheap , London , and as early as 1784 a London Scot named James Glen was preaching Swedenborgianism in Philadelphia and Boston .
