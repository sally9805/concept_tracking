What kind of man was Frank Kierdorf , Jimmy Hoffa 's friend and business agent for Teamster Local 332 in Flint , Mich. ? For a reading , a TIME correspondent tracked down a Flint businessman ( " For God 's sake , do n't mention my name " ) who had had labor dealings with Kierdorf . The answer raises other questions . What kind of city is Flint ? And what kind of nation is the U.S. when it lets Hoffa-type racketeering stand astride U.S. businessmen and workers ? The report : <P> THE first time I met Kierdorf was in 1956 . He laid down a union recognition form and asked me to sign . He came right in here and laid it on my desk . We never had had a union before , and we never had been approached . If our employees wanted a union , we had no objections . We asked for a vote . <P> Kierdorf said there would be no vote . Just like that . Within a week we had a Teamster picket line . All truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the union . Kierdorf was our man . We did n't deal with anyone else . <P> We took it to the state mediator-we were n't big enough for the National Labor Relations Board-and Kierdorf said no . Just like that . He would n't agree . <P> So he 's still picketing . We 're using the railroad . We send our men to be in business . But then the boys start getting run off the road and threatened . They threw two stink bombs in my house . The house still stinks . <P> They attacked one of our drivers at the station . Our drivers were supposed to go in pairs . That 's what I told them to do for protection . They waited until one of our men was in the warehouse . The other was getting in his truck to move the truck over to the dock . Kierdorf 's Cadillac pulled up behind the driver just getting in the truck , and four fellows jumped out , beat him over the head with a pipe , beat him to the ground . Twenty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Cadillac turned around to leave , they got the license number , and it was Kierdorf 's . <P> That blow licked us . I gave up and we were unionized . First he signed the drivers and the outside men . Then Kierdorf let me rest for three weeks . Then he came back and said , " We want your secretaries . " So , finally , we went to George Kamenow the Detroit bagman for Labor Relations Associates Boss Nate Shefferman , great and good friend to the then Teamster President Dave Beck and paid off $2,000 and agreed to pay a monthly retainer of $75 . That was that ; no secretaries were organized . But two weeks after the McClellan committee began sniffing around , Kierdorf came around and organized our secretaries . <P> The police are afraid . They know Kierdorf 's men are bigger than they are . Oh yes , they are too . I 'd ask them for help-I 've known most of the people around here most of my life-and they 'd say , " We ca n't enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy .
