. My Husband , Arthur Murray My husband , Arthur , has been the giant in his field for thirty-five years . As far back as 1927 , when a British dance instructor wanted a description of a new American craze , he telephoned the world 's foremost authority on ballroom dancing . In his quiet , rather hesitant voice , Arthur asked the Londoner to hold the phone . Then he moved the receiver close to a phonograph , and as an Arthur Murray girl stamped out the black bottom , my husband gave instructions and the heat . He 's been setting the tempo of the nation 's 5150,000,000-a-year dance-lesson business ever since . Transatlantic : calls were rare in those days . It is typical of Arthur 's talent for promotion that the Englishman picked up the tab fur the fifteen-minute call  --  it came to $375 ? while Arthur made the news headlines . I came into Arthur 's life during the flapper era and , shortly after our marriage , began to enjoy dancing at his mid-Manhattan studio on 4:3rd Street . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today there are sots ) teachers in 450 studios in this country and in England , Canada , Bermuda , Puerto Rico , Mexico , Australia , South Africa and Germany . But in the beginning we had one ballroom with a brightly waxed floor curtained into private cubicles , and one large phonograph that needed attention after every record . Our teachers ran to the machine after each number and squabbled over whether to play a fox trot or a waltz . Arthur never taught the Charleston until it had been accepted by the best people , and he did n't hurry to teach Latin-Arderican dances either . But after he gave them the nod our studios were teaching the rumba to five Argentine millionaires at once . Society people liked to take their lessons at ten in the morning and usually came three mornings a week . Forty-third Street was choked with our pupils ' limousines . I remember one fashionable matron who came in a Rolls-Royce with chauffeur ; an hour later , her daughter came in another Rolls with her own chauffeur . Arthur roamed the studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure they 'd been dusted , adjusting windows , emptying ash trays and , in emergencies , running the elevator or the switchboard . One day , passing a dance cubicle , he was startled to hear a girl squeal , " Catch me , Mr. Ginzberg ! " He flung open the curtain just in time to sec an Arthur Murray girl land in the outstretched arms of a surprised-looking shoe salesman . She had been an adagio dancer ; Arthur told her no acrobatics were permitted , and she soon left us . I can remember the consternation when Mrs. Merriweather Post Davies , of the Post cereal millions , found that she could not book her usual teacher one afternoon . Being a gracious , charming person , she consented to dance with another instructor . But feathers flew when she discovered that her favorite iipartner had been booked by her cook . Mrs. Davies brought her daughter Eleanor to the studio and told Arthur she wanted him to teach her personally , explaining , " I want her to be a heavenly dancer . " Arthur had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be persuaded . The lessons would be charged at four times the usual rate . Arrangements for a daily lesson were made , and each day Eleanor appeared in a different outfit . Arthur notices clothes , and after the twenty-fourth lesson he remarked , " You know , I 've never seen you in the same dress twice . " Three days later the lessons came to an end ; Eleanor had run out of changes . Bradley Martin , the banker , began taking lessons in the ' 20 's and still comes regularly , although he is now in his seventies . The late Robert Young , of the New York Central , and his wife came , and the Kennedys of Boston , and Harvey Firestone , an inveterate dancer . Later , beautiful Eleanor Searle was our receptionist before she married Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney . Vincente Minnelli , the DeWitt Wallaccs , of Reader 's Digest , and Lowell Thomas were faithful students . Philip Wylie , the author , is one of our most satisfied customers , and after an evening jitterbugging with him I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables . During the years we have greatly improved our teaching techniques , but in the 1920 's we had no training classes , as such . Experienced teachers taught the newer ones when they had time . Now our trainees put in 400 hours of instruction before they face a pupil . One of dur first teachers was Ethel Fistere , a petite flame-haired girl just out of college . One night Arthur stepped into her cubicle and watched her doing a slow tango with Michael Lerner of the Lerner stores . When they had finished , he said to Mr. Lerner , " Now dance that alone . " As he expected , the clothing-store magnate shifted helplessly from one foot to the other . Arthur stuttered badly in those days , especially when he was vexed . " Mr. L-L-Lerner , " he sputtered , " you-you 've b-b-been wasting your ti-ti-time and money . Miss Fistere has been 1-1-leading you . " He offered to give the clothing-store magnate another teacher and free lessons . Mike Lerner , who knew Arthur well , just laughed and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our students dance alone frequently , and are tested on their ability to dance without the aid of a partner . Arthur has always believed in handsome , attractive studios , decorated by experts . In the ' 20 's , when Spanish and Italian palaces were springing up at Palm Beach , our New York studio became a Florentine show place decorated with heavy walnut furniture , red velvet seats , gold fringe and massive carved doors . In the late ' 30 's , Arthur switched to Early American , and then , in the ' 40 's , to Dorothy Draper modern , which we have today . Real doors replaced curtains on the private-instruction cubicles , but Arthur installed portholes so he could cruise about the studio and keep an eye on lessons . He still does that , although most of our instruction is given now in big , open ballrooms ; Arthur can spot a good teacher by the way he watches his pupil instead of himself in the floor-to-ceiling mirrors . One of my first teachers was I lerb Richards , who now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to be a stockbroker , but after the market crash in 1929 there were few openings on Wall Street . I le had been the best Charleston dancer at Harvard , so he came to us for a job . He gave lessons to Mr. and Mrs. John D. Rockefeller , Jr. ? " darling people , " says Herb  --  and once , with six-foot-three Winthrop Rockefeller , formed a conga line of people who were watching a Fifth Avenue parade , leading them through the lobby of Rockefeller Center and up to the roof , where his parents were giving a party . One of Herb 's pupils was Jessica Ogilvie , of the Ogilvie hair-preparations family , a strong , big-framed woman whom Herb found exceedingly difficult to lead . She could not seem to take a step more than twelve inches long . After trying a tango , Herb knew what was wrong ; from bust to knee Miss Ogilvie was encased in a heavy corset . They stumbled through another phonograph recording . Finally Herb wiped his brow and suggested as politely as he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her corset . Miss Ogilvie fixed the Harvard boy with an icy stare , spun on her heel and left . Returning , she had the corset neatly wrapped in paper , and from then on lessons proceeded splendidly . If Arthur had been within earshot , however , I do n't believe Herb would today be netting 580,000 a year as a branch manager , with franchised studios in England and Australia and on the West Coast . In those days I did n't share Arthur 's business life , as I do now . We lived in Mount Vernon , and I busied myself with the concerns of a suburban housewife . I drove to the market , the P.T.A. , Red Cross meetings and bridge parties ; I chauffeured my twin daughters , Jane and Phyllis , to swimming and skating lessons ; I took lessons in gardening . And every night I fed the twins and waited for Arthur to come home for dinner . As the studio did n't close until ten o'clock , I sometimes waited a long time . Arthur often held teachers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train leaves from Grand Central at eleven o'clock , so we 'll have to finish by then . " Still engrossed at the end of an hour , he would say , " Well , I 've missed that train . We 'll talk until 11130 . " Sometimes the meeting would continue until the last train left  --  at midnight . It never occurred to Arthur that some of his teachers lived an hour 's bus ride away in Jersey or Long Island . Ethel Fisterc lived in South Orange and frequently went home boiling mad because Arthur was so critical of her teaching technique . " But I kept on working for him , " she said the other day . " I knew I could learn more about the dance business from Mr. Murray than from anybody else in the field . " Ethel now holds an Arthur Murray franchise and owns five studios  --  four in the Washington , D.C. , area and one in Frankfurt , Germany . There is something about Arthur 's dancing , a certain smoothness , grace and style , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've watched thousands and danced with hundreds . Even more important , he can analyze dance steps and communicate this knowledge . When we first heard about the rumba , Arthur and I sailed to Cuba to study the native dancers . We spent weeks there ; then Arthur diagramed the steps for our staff . But he was n't satisfied with the results  --  too much hip movement , by far . In an attempt to solve the problem , we invited a group of dancers from the interior of Cuba to come to the studio and give a demonstration . With his usual sense of publicity , Arthur also invited the newsreel people and the press . An hour before the demonstration was to begin , Arthur feared that none of the guests would show up . After the dance started , he was sorry that they had . The Cuban women wore long skirts slashed open in front and tied at the waist ; as they began their sensuous gyrations to the beat of a Cuban band , Arthur saw the reporters ' jaws drop . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored skirts the women wore absolutely nothing . It was several years later , after we had retired ( or so we thought ) to Beverly Hills , that Arthur perfected his analysis of rumba motion . " Forget about the hips entirely , " he told me . " The whole trick is to step weightlessly , as if you were going upstairs . " We tried it together and knew we had it ; Arthur had reconstructed what the Cubans had done but could n't explain . Back in New York , lunching at a popular restaurant with student Mary E. Dillon , president of the Brooklyn Borough Gas Company , Arthur could n't wait to demonstrate his new knowledge . Up and down the crowded restaurant aisle they rumbaed , Arthur humming happily and oblivious to the stares of hundreds of lady shoppers . Another dance that gave us trouble was the cha-cha-cha . At first we taught it by counting out " one-two-cha-cha-cha . " This worked in practice , but was impossible to diagram ; it looked like five beats to a measure . Arthur retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged with a solution , He changed the name of the dance to cha-cha and the count to one-two-three-cha-cha . The two " cha-chas " are said very quickly , making one beat , or a total of four beats to the measure . Of course , Arthur 's talents go further than analyzing dance steps . There were no big dance schools when he opened his Ncw York studio in 1924 . He pioneered his own teaching methods , wrote his own advertisements , and through some unique methods of personal publicity mode the name Arthur Murray world-famous . Once a letter came to New York with nothing on the envelope but the name of the city and a sketch of a rising sun . The post office was n't fazed ; the sun must mean morning or A.m. ? who else but Arthur Murray ? But all this was obscurity compared with what happened after we went on television in 1950 . When I am asked how to break into television , I say that the surest way is to marry a sponsor , which is what Arthur was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my sponsor a husband who loves to show off what he calls my accomplishments . In the beginning , however , being M.C. on my husband 's variety show was no joy ride , for his career was one of the stormiest in TV history . During our first year on the air four directors , five producers and an advertising agency threw in the towel , shouting , " Sponsor inter-ference ! " For our first TV show , a fifteen-minute spot on Monday evenings , I simply left my desk , walked around the corner to the C.B.S . studio on Vanderbilt Avenue and , without a script or any special make-up , picked some man out of the studio audience and gave him a dance lesson . The only good thing that came out of this brief series was an ad lib I made one day signing off : " To put a little fun in your life  --  try dancing ! " Arthur liked it and made it our TV signature . Then he picked up the tab for time and talent for a half-hour spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began . Television was in its infancy , and Arthur felt , often rightly , that the industry was riddled with incompetent amateurs . " Sponsor " was a dirty word to TV production men , and the fact that a dancing teacher was willing to pit his showmanship and know-how against theirs was infuriating . Arthur wanted to create on TV the effortless gaiety of the Saturday-night studio parties we give for students  --  dancing , games , prizes , contests . But nothing in TV , we discovered , is achieved effortlessly . For our first half-hour show , the A.B.C . network assigned as director an easygoing fellow whose experience lay chiefly in musical comedy . His idea of an Arthur Murray party was a bare stage and plain curtain and me sitting at a desk making announcements . His camera shots included the whole stage , even when a magician was doing tricks that called for close-ups . He was also concerned about showing everyone 's feet in the dance numbers . Most television sets had ten- and twelve-inch screens in those days , so the dancers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closer ! " Arthur shouted to the cameramen . " Show the dancers ' faces ! The audience wants to see personalities , not feet ! " Television lighting was crude then . For our early shows , an electrician would place a few powerful floodlights in the balcony , turn on all the stage lights and then go home , hours before the show began . On the screen my face looked gaunt , with hollows in my cheeks and bags under my eyes . Arthur sought advice from Hal Phyfe , favorite photographer of society women , and studied other TV shows where the lighting was better . He learned that some lights should be placed well behind the performer , with a bright spotlight in front , two feet off the floor , to wash out lines and shadows . It was incredible what a difference good lighting made in my appearance . Arthur 's do-it-yourself tactics sometimes had stage crews tearing their hair . He thought nothing of racing up a ladder to rearrange one rose in a background urn , or adjusting a fold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . As I turned on a welcoming smile for the cameras , I was usually frantically gesturing Arthur out of the way . Even today Arthur is inclined to look toward the Ifonfinued from Page 41 ) effect he wants , turning a blind eye on gritty details . The director must think of costume changes , camera positions and the spacing ofstation breaks , acts and commercials ; a l must be planned down to the split second . But when Arthur decides to eliminate a performer or cut down on a song , in his mind these are trivial points to be worked out , perhaps onlyan hour before showti me . He met his match , though , when I introduced him to my father . Arthur and I were on our first date  --  this was in December , 1924 ? and he had already banked 5100,000 . My father , who was advertising manager for the old Hudson Observer in Hoboken , New Jersey , asked Arthur what he did . Arthur said he danced . My father remarked , 1 do , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like most people , my father thought of dancing as a silly occupation with no future  --  until he caught sight of Arthur 's car , a $12,000 Rolls-Royce . It was a lovely open phaeton with a little bonnet top in back , which Arthur had bought from movie siren Theda Bara . He soon traded it for a United States-made sedan , after he decided that everyone overcharged a Rolls owner . Although my husband is now a wealthy man , he still hates to be cheated . With Arthur it is n't the principle , it 's the money . Over the years , he has been involved in a number of lawsuits over money . He has been sued by stage stars , TV writers , even by his dentist . The dentist sued him for $850 ; Arthur retaliated by suing for $100,000 for inferior work . This is his favorite sum for lawsuits ? " A nice , round figure , " he says happily , He can be extremely generous , and a great penny pincher too . At hotels Arthur always leaves a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he insists on knowing what 's in a doctor 's prescription , because he might get the same formula in a patent medicine at half the price . He ca n't abide waste . His digestive system may be kicking up , but if he has bought the table d'h  --  te dinner , he cats every course . He ca n't bear to throw away razor blades , and uses a rather expensive device to keep them sharp . One time he met at a party two presidents of competing blade companies , Samuel Stampleman of Gillette and Joseph Mailman of Pal . Arthur told them brightly , " I get thirty shaves from every Pal blade . " Mailman turned to Stampleman and remarked sourly , " Such a customer you can have . " When he was well on the way toward his second million , Arthur found undershorts on sale in a cigar store for nineteen cents a pair . He bought several dozen , only to find that the Sherry-Netherland , where we were staying , charged twenty-five cents a pair for laundering . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When collars and cuffs on his custom-made shirts get ragged , he has new ones sewn on ; once he could n't get a match for his blue and pink shirts , so he had white collars and cuffs sewn on and said that he was launching a new style . Chuck Harris , who has been with our studio for thirty-two years , once impressed Arthur by working very hard during a week of emergency . As a special reward , Arthur told Chuck that he could have his pay check on Friday that week instead of Saturday . That 's my Arthur , the same man who gives 50 per cent of his income to charity . Since 1952 he has given more than 2000 TV sets to hospitals for the use of patients with chronic diseases , and he has paid heavy medical bills for a great many employees . Arthur 's looks are deceptive ; he appears to be a mild man . His olive skin , usually deeply tanned , is smooth and un lined , and except for his loss of hair he looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has always weighed the same , 150 , and his posture is so good that he seems taller than his actual height  --  five feet nine . His smile , I think , is charming . He stuttered when he was courting me , but that passed . Now he speaks in a soft , hesitant voice  --  his secretary says he summons her by clearing his throat . But when he looks at you it seems as if he were reading your innermost thoughts . When I first met Arthur he was teaching dance lessons by mail . He had rented a loft at 67th Street and Madison Avenue and employed thirty girls to open his mail and shake out the one- , five- and ten-dollar bills . His brother Dave , an attorney , supervised the office . Arthur usually checked in about noon , wearing riding clothes , and stayed an hour : he spent the afternoon on horseback in Central Park . During one of those noontime working hours , Arthur must have felt that all should be equal , because he suddenly offered a gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail addressers , most of whom had never been within a mile of a riding horse . Some arrived for lessons in overalls , while others wore black velvet jockey caps . The first lesson was a deep-seated success  --  the girls stood on their feet the next day to open the mail . During the second lesson , one of them fell from her horse . The next day the girl sued Arthur for her downfall . Thus ended the philanthropic riding lessons . Arthur does n't ride any more , but he still spends the morning at home . Our 450 branches send voluminous weekly reports ; these he reads with passionate concern while he putters around fixing his own breakfast . He eats it in installments , beginning with custard or rice pudding , which I bake myself , followed by a dish of conage cheese with honey . A bit later he may stir up a coffee-flavored milk shake . He 's generally through breakfast by I I : 30 and does not eat another sit-down , regular meal until eight or nine P.M. Until recently he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nibbled them all afternoon . In his childhood , poverty denied him the sweets he craved . His office at our 43rd Street studio is a very small room , paneled in redwood . Most of the space is taken by upholstered chairs for relaxing and a coral leather couch . Presiding over staff meetings , if a A I u n DA Y V. V t. r , t NI/ I , 0 9'I Arthur is sometimes stretched out full length like a Roman emperor , He ! Rinks lest when lying down with eyes closed . He sutlers from insomnia , but he does n't mind it , as some of his best ideas have come when he 's awake at night . When we lint met , I thought Arthur was sophisticated and Inciting , but too old for me . I was a giddy , flapperish eighteen ; Arthur was a hadielor of twenty-nine . My family , the kohnielderx , were what you might call middle middle class , I guess ; we lived on two floors of a big two-fainily house in Jersey City , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My father , Abraham Lincoln Kolinfelder , earned a good salary as a newspaperman and was adept at making money on the side in real estate . We lived on Booracm Avenue in Jersey City . It was a pleasant street , with lots of big trees , and most of our neighbors were German or Irish . Our dining room had a green glass dome hanging over the table , and the living room had an oriental rug , a settee upholstered in green silk  --  of which my mother was very proud  --  and a player piano in an alcove . What fun we had around that piano ! My father had once spent six months in vaudeville , flourishing a straw hat and cane ; he was a natural buck-and-winger and knew the words to hundreds of songs . He was gay and charming , and I adored him . My mother , Lenore , still a very pretty woman , was strikingly good-looking in those days , with auburn hair , white skin and china-blue eves . Mother was very devoted to my handsome elder brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been hard to love ; I was very homely , and for the first five years of my life suffered from eczema . Our mother 's helper , Helen Edclbach , who now takes care of my grandchildren , says that I used to lie in my crib and scratch my face and arms and legs until the skin bled . Doctors found that milk disagreed with me , and I was put on a diet of barley and lime-water . I guess that 's why I 'm only live feet one ; my bones just never had a chance to grow much . By the time I started school , however , my skin had cleared up . School was a snap , and I skipped two grades , entering high school at eleven . There l discovered that only squares got high marks , so I let my work slip , sassed the teacher and tried to ape the glamour girls of the school . I was a skinny little runt with no looks to recommend me , but I concentrated on being peppy and gay and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen I had droves of beaux , including some of my brother Norman 's classmates at Columbia . I had the perfect flapper figure and saved and saved for my heart 's desire , a Bramley . This was a short pleated skirt with a long overblouse and a belt that hit my hips . With it , I wore striped barber-pole stockings and unbuckled galoshes , a costume that stopped traffic . After my graduation from Dickinson High School in Jersey City , I landed my first real job : summertime file clerk in a telephone company on Wall Street . I earned fifteen dollars a week , out of which I was supposed to pay for my own lunches , clothes and transportation , and contribute five dollars a week toward my board . The money was not needed at home , but my mother wanted me to acquire a sense of responsibility . I learned a valuable lesson when I splurged ten dollars of my first pay check on a hat I could n't resist . It was a turban of sapphire-blue velvet , suitable for a matron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and had to borrow lunch and carfare money from my brother . It took me forever to pay him back . My parents thought I should he a Schoolteacher , and I went along with the idea , provided I could attend Cornell , where I had heard that boys outnumbered girls by len to one . I was graduated from high school at fifteen , which my parents considered far too young to leave home for college . So we compromised ; in the spring of 1922 I entered State Normal School in Newark , New Jersey . Two years later , when I started practice leaching , I was assigned to a so-called " continuation " class of behavior problems and roughnecks . They were all a lot bigger than I was and scared me to pieces . To keep them quiet , I gave them compositions to write , like , What I Would Do With a Hundred Dollars . They loved that one . Then I asked them to do A Description of My Teacher . One boy wrote , " We have a substitute teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least her chest sticks out further than her chin . " One of my friends at Normal School was a girl named Peggy Muller , who was going with a boy who was director of radio station WOR in Newark . A popular jai. hand , named The Californians , was playing on WOR , and Peggy and I decided to go to the studio to see their program . On our way over in a bus Peggy remarked , " By the way , you 'll meet Arthur Murray tonight . " " Who 's he ? " I asked . " Have n't you seen those big dancing ads in the magazines and newspapers ? " " Oh , " I replied , " you mean the man with the footprints . He 's real ? " Peggy and I sat in the studio and listened to The Californians play that lovely tune , The Man I Love . Presently a thin young man came out and spoke hesitantly into the microphone . " This is Arthur Murray , " he said . He spelled it out , letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . Then he did an exhibition dance step , describing it into the microphone for the benefit of the radio audience . I was fascinated by the way he moved . After the dance lesson he came over to be introduced . I was wearing a dress which a loving neighbor had run up on her sewing machine from a remnant of green cluvetyn . It was cut Russian-tunic style and hugged every inch of me , right up to my chin , When Arthur invited me to dance , I sprang to my feet and threw open my arms , whereupon the skintight dress unsnapped in front completely . I hurriedly snapped myself together and again held out my arms  --  cautiously . As we danced , I waited for the compliment I 'd had so often ? " Wow ! Arc you good ! " But Arthur merely asked me , with a pained expression , to please remove my hand from his back and put it on his shoulder . At the end of the dance I said brightly , " Now I can tell my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims he thought at the time , but was too shy to say , " You mean our grandchildren . " The following week Arthur phoned me for a Tuesday-night date . At eighteen , I was not allowed to have midweek dates , but having given Arthur the impression that I was twenty , I was too embarrassed to tell him the house rules . So I pretended I had another date , and he hung up . After a couple of days he phoned back to make a Friday-night date , and I arrepted . But during that week I developed an ingrown toenail which became so painful I could hardly walk ; so I phoned and said I was sick . I could tell by his voice that Arthur was annoyed by this second brush-off . Besides , he had decided that Jersey City was too far from New York , where he lived , for dating purposes . When a week of silence passed , I swallowed my pride and wrote Arthur a penitent little note , explaining truthfully about the toe and saying that I certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and invited me to a Broadway show . But he expected me to meet him in New York , and I knew my parents would never allow me to go into the city alone to meet this celebrity . Several of the neighbors had told my mother they were sure he was married . I accepted the invitation with great enthusiasm and then , speaking very quickly so he could n't interrupt , gave him directions for getting to Booraem Avenue in Jersey City . There was a pause at the other end of the line , and I had the feeling that Arthur was going to develop a cold . But he finally agreed to call for me . At six o'clock on a January evening of 1925 , Arthur drew up to our house in his open Rolls-Royce , imposing if chilly . He greeted me with a slightly amused expression . Mother was wearing one of her best dresses and looked very pretty . Dad generously offered Mr. Murray a glass of gin from a crock in the basement , this being during prohibition . Arthur detests alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he made a wry face and asked for sugar . Dad hurried me out to the kitchen . " It 's O.K. , baby . Anybody who puts sugar in a drink is safe to go out with . " Arthur took me to dinner at the Hotel Vanderbilt on Park Avenue , then popular with members of the Southern aristocracy . He told me that he had lived in Asheville and Atlanta almost ten years . noticed a lot of pretty young girls were bowing and smiling at him from all sides of the dining room . 1 ca n't remember what we ate . Arthur started to tell me about the dancing business , and the more he talked the more fascinated I became . He went on and on . We missed the opening curtain . He talked . We missed the entire play , for which he had tickets in his vest pocket . I listened to him for four hours , and I hardly said ten words . As he reached for the check , Arthur remarked , " We have such a good time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
