In New Jersey 's teeming ( pop . 700,000 ) Hudson County , where annual county and city elections are among the liveliest in the U.S. , newsmen who are willing to turn out speeches and publicity for political candidates have long found a rewarding short-term market for their talents . Reporters on Sam Newhouse 's Jersey Journal ( circ. 98,565 ) have enjoyed a virtual monopoly as political pressagents . The opposition Hudson Dispatch , the county 's only other comparable pool of literary talent , has traditionally barred its employees from participating in political campaigns , while the Journal 's policy has been to grant staffers leaves of absence . <P> With luck and an appreciative candi date the interlude can even become permanent . After Democratic Boss John V. <P> Kenny defeated the Hague machine in 1949 eight Journalists landed full-time propaganda jobs on city and county pay rolls ( cost to taxpayers : more than $60,000 a year ) . Eight other Journal staffers have since taken publicity leaves and returned to their newspaper jobs after elections . <P> In recent weeks political prosewriters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever before . With countywide primaries as well as Jersey City and Hoboken elections set for April and May , <P> an all-time record number of candidates ( total to date : 150 ) are running for 54 jobs . But last week , when veteran Court house Reporter Haig Anlian , 38 , asked for a twelve-week leave from his $104-a-week newspaper job to work as a candidate 's pressagent for $300 a week . Journal Editor Paul A. Tierney refused . " I wo n't stand for a wholesale raid on my staff , " snapped Tierney , 62 , who transferred from Newhouse 's Long Island Star-Journal to the Jersey Journal only eight months ago . <P> Up on the city-room bulletin board went a warning to staffers that " disciplinary action " would be taken against any reporter who accepts even a part-time job from a candidate . Tierney also sent out letters to every office-seeker in Hudson County , pointing out that it would be " manifestly unfair " to allow reporters to work for some candidates but not others . <P> " An even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conflict of interest arising from such employment of members of our organization . " For the first time in Hudson County history , it looked as if many politicians will be left to their own devices and/or speechless at election time .
