" Mr. Attlee confirmed that Mr. Mao had asked for British Labor party support to get the United States to withdraw its Seventh Fleet from Formosa Strait and halt the rearming of Japan and West Germany . But the Labor leader said he also had told the Communist leader there were " certain things " he would like the Russians to do . In addition to a reduction of ' arms by the Soviet Union , which he called " the most heavily armed country in the world , " Mr. Attlee , head of a touring Labor party delegation that arrived here yesterday from Red China , said he had told Mr. Mao at a three-Iour talk in Peiping : " We believe in the freedom of people to manage their own affairs and we should like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the point that the Russians should " give up their intrigues in other countries .

Mr. Attlee is scheduled to remain in Hong Kong two days before leaving for Singapore Saturday en route to Australia . In reply to a question on Formosa , Mr , Attlee noted the Chinese Communists had shown a " strong determination " to " liberate " that Nationalist-held island . He told another questioner he thought it would be a " useful thing " to neutralize Formosa for a " small period " before a final settlement of the island 's status . The Labor party leader said his group had discussed trade and the question of Chinese-British diplomatic relations with Communist leaders . He said he had expressed the hope it would soon be possible to " have a Chinese Embassy in London , " but did not disclose what the response was . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic relations have not yet been established . A Brit ' ish charg ? d'affaires has been stationed in Peiping and Peiping is reportedly preparing to send a charg ? d'affaires to London . However , there has been no mention so far of any move to exchange ambassadors . Asked whether he had brought up in Peiping the question of Americans imprisoned in China , Mr. Attlee said that specific point was not discussed . He added , however , that he had told Peiping Government leaders it // was a " great mistake " to hold persons in China against their will and that this was having an adverse effect on British opinion . The Labor party leader said his group had seen " smile representatives of ? the churches " in China . He said the group had the impression that the antipathy being shown toward foreign Christian missions in " China , sprang more from nationalism than communism . In summarizing his general impressions of Red China , Mr. Attlee said one " does not come tol final judgments " after a short visit to an unfamiliar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his group consisted of democratic Socialists who did not agree with the Communist principles on which China was now being governed . He said the delegation recognized that China was a Communist-run country and was not surprisea to find , for example , that the trade union movement was a Government instrument to " insure more production . " Nevertheless , he declared , the mission had been impressed by " certain very definite reforms , " which he said appeared to " mark a new departure for China . " " The second thing that struck us all was that this Government is tackling tasks of immense magnitude and that there was no pretense that everything was all right , " Mr. Attlee continued . " There were frank statements by the Chinese that they had a long leeway . That is in contrast with Russia where we are always assured that the whole world is lagging behind Russia . " Mr. Attlee told the correspondents he had seen no overt examples of Soviet control in China . He said that while Peiping depended on the Soviet Union for supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned to specific jobs in China went home after the Chinese had learned " all they could . " He said he felt that , generally speaking , there was " less rigidity " in applying Marxist ideology in China than in the Soviet Union and also a " tendency toward greater tolerance . " " The evidence we have everywhere is that you have here a Government that is incorruptible , that is genuinely working in accordance with the principles believed , and that has done some very remarkable pieces of work , " the Labor party leader said . " Take one thing that struck us all  --  the amount of work being done from the point of view of public health . " Mr. Attlee said his mission had seen " practical evidence " of Chinese Communist accomplishments in Peiping and Mukden and else'where had noted " extraordinary activity " in the educational field . " I believe the Government is doing something for the prosperity of the peasant and that the Chinese peasant thinks the Government is concerned with the welfare of the peasants , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the evidence we had seems to show you had here a Government which is based on the goodwill of the peasant population .
