Two CHEERS FOR DEMOCRACY ( 363 pp. ) -E . M. Forsfer-Harcourf , Brace ( $4 ) . <P> <P> As any visitor to the untidy London flat might guess , it houses an old bachelor . In the sitting room , a hastily thrown coverlet drapes an obviously unmade bed . A litter of books , manuscripts and knick-knacks lines walls and floors like the twigs of a nest . Amiably at home in this cozy mess flutters a rare old bird , the dean of English letters , Edward Morgan Forster . <P> Seventy-two-year-old E. M. Forster is almost as rumpled and untidy as his rooms . The tweeds he wears are worn and baggy , his thinning grey hair unruly , his bushy grey mustache in need of a trim . Bony and angular , with pale , piercing eyes , he looks , as one American interviewer put it , rather " like a spare , intelligent , ruffled heron . " <P> Nibbling the Cheese . These days , the heron is hobbled , too . In a fall last June , Forster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and limps about painfully . But the flashing intelligence and humane spirit which gave the 20th Century one of its finest novels , A Passage to India , are as unhobbled as ever . <P> A Passage to India appeared in 1924 . After it , Forster unaccountably banked the creative fires which had blazed through five crackling good novels , beginning with Where Angels Fear to Tread in 1905 . Fireside chats took their place . Mostly contemplative , critical essays and reminiscences , these were first collected in Abinger Harvest , published in 1936 . Two Cheers for Democracy brings the collection up to date . <P> In his new chats , Forster roams freely from Beethoven 's Symphony No. g and Eliot 's Cocktail Party to a laughing description of how a South African houseboy once dumped a juicy platter of chicken in his lap . While demonstrating the range of his mind , he also files a minority report on the direction in which he thinks civilization is moving . Skeptical , urbane , relativistic , Two Cheers for Democracy is the report of a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open mind . In an age of anxiety , he implies , more &; more men are nibbling at the tempting cheese of " absolutes " and " certainties . " To Forster , the only certainty is that too much certainty leads to intolerance , and intolerance leads man into bloody traps . <P> Judging Brutus . In his tilt with the absolutists , Forster employs one absolute of his own : moral courage . " I hate the idea of causes , and if I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend , I hope I should have the guts to betray my country . Such a choice may scandalize the modern reader ... It would not have shocked Dante , though . Dante places Brutus and Cassius in the lowest circle of Hell because they had chosen to betray their friend Julius Caesar rather than their country Rome . . . Love and loyalty to an individual can run counter to the claims of the state . When they do-down with the state , say I , which means that the state would down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
