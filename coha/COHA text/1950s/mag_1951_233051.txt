When school opened in Tucson , Ariz , this fall , Superintendent Robert D. Morrow had reason to feel uneasy . He had never wanted to be " either a heel or a hero , " but heel or hero he was destined to be . Morrow had been trying to get rid of Jim Crow in the city 's public schools for the past six months-ever since the state legislature passed a law leaving the decision up to local communities . <P> Some parents protested hotly against the Morrow campaign , and some even called him up to tell him what a " Communist , " " nigger-lover , " or " Fascist " they thought he was . None of that bothered Morrow much . What did bother him was what Tucson 's parents would say when they found out what he had done with the 19 Negro teachers from the city 's Negro schools . <P> He had scattered them all through the school system . He left Morgan Maxwell , Negro principal of the junior high school for Negroes , where he was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under him . And Morrow had hired another Negro teacher , plus two Chinese , and a Navajo . <P> On opening day , Superintendent Morrow sat back and waited . For the first time , " African and Caucasian " pupils filed into classrooms together . For the first time , so did " African and Caucasian " teachers . Books were distributed , assignments given out , and the year began . By last week Superintendent Morrow , flummoxed but happy , knew how his campaign had come out . " Why , it 's working ! " he cried . <P> Elsewhere , the case against Jim Crow ran into some snags . On opening day in San Antonio , ten Negro boys &; girls showed up at five different white schools , asked to be admitted because their own schools did not have equal facilities . The principals all refused . The University of North Carolina 's first Negro students found that they were free to eat and study with whites , but not to cheer . At football games , they were barred from the cheering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
