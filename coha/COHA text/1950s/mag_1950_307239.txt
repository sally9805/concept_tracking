Nevertheless , Dwarka Nath , a young shopkeeper , set off gaily , with his cousin Madan Mohan , for a wedding date with the lovely Uma Vanti in a village 50 miles away . After they had traveled 45 miles the young men came to the turbulent river Devak Nullah and found that the bridge had been swept away . As there was no boat available they plunged into the water . Madan Mohan , a strong swimmer , made the other bank . Bridegroom Nath spluttered , choked and turned back . With only one hour left before the time fixed by the astrologers for the ceremony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nath 's absence . <P> Uma 's father knew it was bad luck for the bride if a wedding is postponed . Thinking fast , he asked Madan Mohan if he would take his cousin 's place . One glance at the fair Uma , and Madan grinned consent . <P> The next day when Dwarka arrived he found the wedding had taken place on schedule . <P> <P> *Hindus can only marry in three of the twelve months .
