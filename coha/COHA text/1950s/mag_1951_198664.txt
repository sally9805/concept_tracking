In two of the biggest moments of last year 's winter track season , boggles by the officials blurred the results to the point of farcical anticlimax . The two big questions : 1 ) Did Don Gehrmann or Fred Wilt win the Wanamaker Mile ? 2 ) Did , or did not , the Rev. Robert Richards become the second man in history to pole-vault 15 feet ? + <P> It took the wrangling authorities ten months to declare , beyond further appeal , that Gehrmann had won the Wanamaker ( TIME , Dec. 18 ) . It took an admission of grievous error ( the crossbar had been too low ) to convince Robert Richards , and the crowd , that he had vaulted only 14 ft. 11 in . <P> In successive one-night stands in Philadelphia and Boston last week , Gehrmann and Wilt went after each other again , and Parson Richards went after 15 feet . With the officials behaving impeccably this time , there was no doubt whatever about the results . <P> Fred Wilt , 30 , a Manhattan FBI man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inquirer Mile in advance : to set a fast pace in order to tire Don Gehrmann as much as possible , take the edge off Gehrmann 's famous last-lap sprinting . <P> But Wilt 's timing was way off . He ran the first three-quarters in a stodgy 3:11.6 , leaving 23-year-old Gehrmann plenty of finishing kick . Gehrmann scooted past in the last 70 yards , won by a clear seven . The time ( not fast , not slow ) : 4:12.4 . In Boston next night , Gehrmann repeated the lesson , won by ten yards in the time of 4:11.5 . <P> Parson Bob Richards , 24 , a philosophy teacher at La Verne College , Calif. , had his hands full keeping up with Illinois ' Don Laz , 21 , in Philadelphia . They wound up in a tie at 14 ft. 9 5/8 in . It was good pole-vaulting , but still not within breath-holding distance of 15 feet . The breath-holding came in Boston . After clearing the bar easily at 14 ft. 9 in. , Richards tried for the elusive 15 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the crowd on seat-edges , he went over beautifully , only to flick the bar off with his fingers as he let go of the pole . <P> <P> + The first and only man to clear 15 feet : California 's Cornelius Warmerdam , who did it 43 times .
