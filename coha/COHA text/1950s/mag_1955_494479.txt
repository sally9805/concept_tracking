IN THE IMMENSE and garish convention hall of the Sheraton Park Hotel , Neil MtElroy , President of Procter &; Gamble , delivered his Chairman 's Ad ? dress to the 1,826 delegates who came to Washington on November 28 to attend the White House Conference on Education . " This is a conference , not a convention , " he reminded them gently . We are here to confer , not to vote . " In a passage enlivened by unconscious irony , Mr. McElroy continued , We are meeting not as legis lators or representative ? ' but in an honorable capacity : that of adviser to the President of the United States . " The delegates sighed , earnest , responsible , and content . But some time later Louis Hollander , a grizzled veteran of the CIO , was heard voicing , a mock complaint . " I wait to eat , I wait to sleep , I wait to speak , and no one seems to care what I say . Is that the way to treat an honored adviser of President Eisenhower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ com ? plaints about the White House Conference on Education . They chafged , with some justification , that it was set up as a stall by the Eisenhower Administration to conceal its own inability to come to grips with the desperately urgent question of federal action to save our deteriorat ? ing public school system . They charged , with no justi ? fication , that the conference was stacked against the supporters of federal aid . Fifteen hundred of the dele ? gates were chosen , and their positions influenced , in the course of preliminary conferences held in 48 states , and in the territories . And the entire process belied labor fears . For in these preliminary meetings , and in the conference itself , attention was fotused on a critical problem , and constructive energies were set in motion that can not fail to do good . The White House Conference , of course , was far too large to fulfill its advisory role . No free expression of sentiment was possible in a plenary session . No clear directives could be drawn from a final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization chosen worked against policy making , and yet no other method was ' possible . The basic work of the conference was done by groups of 11 delegates , meeting over three , days around 166 round tables . Each group chose a chairman who presented the session report to 18 conferences of nine tables apiece ; these in turn prepared a consensus which was presented at two more conferences ; then the chairmen of the two conferences drafted a final report . This was called distillation , and one of the chairmen at an intermediate conference , Lewis Waldman of New ' York , spoke sadly of " the disabilities of distillation , " For any divergence from the established items for discus ? sion was ruled out at once , while strongly voiced dissents by minorities , together with novel ideas and fine drafts manship , were lost . Instead sharp definition and clear thinking were sacrificed as group chairmen chosen at random searched for lowest common denominators . And yet this was inevitable in a conference of 2,000 " ad visers . " The delegates listened quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to inspire each discussion . They trooped off to their round tables to state their views on the lists of questions prepared by the directors of the Conference . They remembered Mr. McElroy 's plea to help the President by " clear thinking , careful analysis of fact and reasoned expression , " and so they labored over words and commas in the struggle for precise meaning and good style . Then they watched their reports rise through layers of " distillation " until like DECEMBER 12 , 1955 , ascending balloons they grew tiny and disappeared . " Vice ' President Nixon had congratulated us upon be ? ing able to talk directly , in this way , to the President of the . United States , " reported one participant , Dr. Joel Hildebrand , to his organization , the American Chemical Society , " but I must confess that it seemed to me a little like trying to deliver a bottle of good California bur ? gundy to a friend in ' Edinburgh by pouring it into San Francisco Bay , and letting him dip such of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had had time to diffuse thither . " ' But the delegates did not lose heart . They understood that it was not likely that the President would be listen ? ing to their advice in the manner outlined by Mr. Mc ? Elroy . They concluded that the worth of the conference was in what they learned from each other in their own small groups . And what they learned was important . Manufacturers from the deep South listened quietly while Negroes gained acceptance for their claims for integrated schools . Californians heard New Yorkers complain of raiding , and agreed that their school superintendents are sent on roundabout routes to conventions , to entice away promising teachers and school administrators wherever they find them . The diversity of viewpoints frequently frustrated and sometimes paralyzed serious discussion at the round tables . And yet wildly improbable combina ? tions of individuals were thrown together whose convic ? tions and prejudices , might have been shielded forever from exposure and debate . Around table 89 for example , there were gathered as equals a grade school . teacher from Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schools from Missouri and a rancher from Idaho ; a life , insurance executive frOm North Carolina and , an official of the League of Women Voters from New York ; a municipal court judge from Minnesota and ' a state legislator from Idaho . Governor Allan Shivers of Texas , and Mrs. Agnes Meyer . ' ' ' You must have had one hell of a time ! " commented one man at a chairmen 's session , after the rancher had attempted to summarize the many separate and conflicting pOsitions of table 89 of the subject of federal . aid . " Brother , " the rancher groaned : We sure did ! " " Let us do what we can to help the President , " said Mr. McElroy in his opening address to the White House Conference . " That is what we are here for . " ? But this was by no means true . The conference was assigned five . topics to consider and an equal amount of time was allotted to each . Of these five only one was for the President a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This one topic " How can we finance our schools ? " was fourth on the list for discussion . In a White House Conference , called to guide the federal government , this was the key subject for which the second topic on local administration and the sixth on public acceptance were barely peripheral . And yet all six were awarded equal attention . The fourth topic , which concerns the gravest needs , which raises the pro ? foundest issues , and which today is embedded in cliches , misunderstandings and oversimplifications , was given so little time that disorder was the predictable result . T HE White House Conference in fact was a meeting of educators and citizens called to consider every aspect of the schools . As such it was logical that the dele ? gates should be instructed first to consider " What should our schools accomplish ? " This was the first topic , and it is the great question from which all others follow . It raises sharp and unre solved issues today. ; Are our schools primarily agencies of intellectual training , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills ? Is concentration upon the funda ? mental intellectual disciplines appropriate only for the one-fifth of our school population that is destined for college , and should the remaining four-fifths be pre ? pared for good citizenship by vocational training or " life adjustment " courses ? Or will we re-emphasize the im ? portance of the liberal arts in the belief that the times require higher standards of general knowledge , perspec ? tive and intellectual capacity ? These questions are urgent . For since 1900 the percentage of students enrolled in a given subject in high school has declined from 84 to 54 in the sciences , from 86 to 55 percent in mathematics , and from 73 to 22 percent in foreign languages . And while the total number of college graduates has increased , the percentage who gain degrees in the liberal arts and sciences has fallen from 70 percent to 40 percent since 1920 , while vocational courses have risen from 14 to 40 percent of all degrees . This drift , moreover , seems cer tain to continue for as long as the basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system credits in home economics and history are on a par in our colleges and universities . The pamphlet called " Suggested Home Work " which was given to the delegates did indicate that the question is one around Which controversy rages today . And it did indicate that this controversy extends to issues such as racial integration , juvenile delinquency and religious instruction . In the course of two hours of discussion it could not be hoped that the round table could seriously consider all these issues . Their burdens were made heavier , unfortunately , by the inept phrasing of the questions they were instructed to discuss . Consequently it was a groiip of rather disheartened chairmen that settled down on Tuesday evening to mesh their reports for the first day . " I 'm used to hearing lay people criticize lawyers for quibbling over words , " said Gordon Johnson , an attorney from San Francisco . " How I wish my asso ? ciates could have been here today ! " The trouble centered in the first question to the round tables by the Conference directors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide a free opportu ? nity to all for an education . Do we affirm this commit ? ment made by our forefathers ? If so , why ? In this inept phrasing , all sides ' gmelled a trap . No delegate could , answer no . But many feared that if they answered yes , the ' answer would be interpreted as an endorsement of local responsibility for free education and therefore as an implied repudiation of federal and state responsibility . Moreover , did " a free opportunity to all for an education " imply a sanction for the current assault on the right of all citizens in the South to at ? tend public schools ? These questions took an hour to resolve in every round table . And , after the majority of worried citizens at each round table had made it clear that the responsibility is shared , the Catholic participants pressed to win acceptance of their belief that the shared responsibility extends beyond public to parochial schools . So the intent of the first topic was largely missed . The final statement reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for " a full opportunity for a free public education regardless of physical , intel ? lectual , social or emotional differences , or of race , creed or religion . " It added , " No level of government , local , state or national should be relieved of its appropriate responsibility in fulfilling this commitment . " This was a meaningful statement , but its impact was lost on the nation . It was meaningful also to the Negro delegates , who interpreted it as an endorsement of ultimate inte ? gration . But that was the extent of the first day 's work . The delegates had been asked : and what should every pupil ' learn in school ? Beyond this basic education which everyone should receive can we list in order of their importance other things the schools should ; try to accomplish . To these over-generalized but important questions the conference report had little to offer . Dr. Adam Bennion , one of the two chairmen who presided at the final layer , of distillation , solemnly informed the delegates that they had affirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fullest development and enrichment of the NEW REPUBLIC individual . " This sentence in the final report was fol lowed by the still more startling news that " Education is a sound and necessary investment in the future well ? being of our nation and its citizens . " Most surprising of all was the assertion that the round tables had agreed that ' " schools are doing the best ' job in their history " in teaching " The fundamental skills . " There followed the consensus of the Conference on the purposes of education ; the first . being " the funda ? mental skills of communication " and " the arithmetical and mathematical skills . " Next history crept in under the didactic cloak of " appreciation for our democratic heritage . " Eleventh on the list , after " social competency " and " ethical behavior , " was " physical and mental health . " The list , then , was preferable to one compiled in 1944 by the National Association of Secondary-School Prin ? cipals which placed " saleable skills " at the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and physical fit ? ness " in second place . But the scale of priorities in edu ? cation demanded the conference was missing while the points that were listed were a jumble of attitudes that must be acquired and subjects that can be taught . From table 40 , Dr. Hildebrand and five associates filed a vigorous protest , claiming that the list of purposes was meaningless , that the complacency of the report was wholly unfounded , and that their own insistence that the schools concentrate upon their fundamental intellectual disciplines was altogether ' lost . T HE SECOND topic of the conference was In what ways can we organize our school systems more efficiently and economically ? It had next to no part in a confer ence ? called to advise the President . It did point to one extremely important question for the future of public education in America : how far is the curriculum of our secondary schools to be controlled by a narrow group of administrators and educationists , and how can scholars , . scientists , parents and citizens generally contribute in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools ? But this question was lost . The discussions at the round tables were generally de tailed and frequently lapsed into the " Here 's how we , do it in St. Louis ; what do you do in Little Rock ? " variety . The third topic once again was disappointing in its concentration upon detail . It asked : " What are our school building needs , exclusive of financing them ? " and it led to a languid discussion , the third of the day among weary delegates . The keynote speaker , William Preston Lane , Jr. , of Maryland , referred to a 1953 survey conducted by the US Office of Education in which out of 41 states replying to a questionnaire , 19 main ? tained that they were losing ground in the struggle to keep pace with classroom needs . The conference report was more pessimistic and declared , that only two or three states have been quoted as ' stating that they can meet their building needs for the next five . years . " The delegates listed the traditional list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statewide basis . " They anticipated federal aid in school , construction and naively added : " The federal govern ? ment should have no control whatsoever over school building plans and specifications . " 0 N Wednesday morning the delegates turned to the first vital topic of the conference : " How can we get enough good teachers ? and keep them ? " Here , as the keynote speaker , Ethel Brown , remarkeci : " Each of us is a specialist . " For those who were not teachers the " Homework " presented the facts , affirming these figures in terms of immediate demands : For , our elementary schools 60,000 teachers to replace those who quit each year . 25,000 to Serve increasing enrollments. 30,000 to relieve overcrowding and eliminate half-day sessions. 10,000 to restore teaching in neglected subjects .. 40,000 to replace unqualified teachers . For our high schools 35,000 to ' replace those who quit . . 5,000 to serve increasing enrollments . The immediate elementary school demand for an addi ? tional 165,000 qualified teachers can be compared , the " Homework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 690,000 . The immediate demand for an additional 40,000 high school teachers can be compared to a present force of 376,000 high school teachers . In terms of the supply of teachers the " Homework " provided these figures : 35,000 Americans became qualified to be elementary ' school teachers in 1955. ' 51,000 became qualified to teach in our high schools . The total number of college graduates has dropped from 434,000 to 285,000 since 1950 . The total num ber of graduates . prepared to teach has fallen from 115,000 to 87,000 .. A further reminder of the , problem was contained in an elegant blue pamphlet , distributed among the dele ? gates and published by the Fund for the Advancement of Education of the Ford Foundation . It declared : About one-fifth of all 1954 graduates of four year colleges entered school teaching . But during the next 10 years more than half of all college graduates of every variety would have to enter school teaching in order to fill our needs entirely from this major source . Confronted by this chapenge the delegates gathered to thrash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join one circle ? the mild-mannered , middle-of-the-road group that met around table 90 . . First the group heard a brief report from Monsignor Frederick Hochwalt , Secretary General of the National ' Catholic Educational Association . He had representedtable 90 at the chairmen 's conferences on the previous topic . He noted now that some issues that the group had considered at great length were passed over quickly because all agreed upon them , while others were dis ? carded because table 90 stood alone . " They could not plumb the depths , " said Hochwalt without rancor . The chairman for this session was the writer , John Hersey . Met us then conclude , " he said , " that the im-. portant thing is the discussion we hold among ourselves and the reports which we take home . Let us strive for creative thinking to meet the basic challenge we face . " The first question assigned to the ' round tables was " What do we mean by ' enough , ' ' good ' teachers ? " Table 90 skipped this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we increase the supply of good teachers ? " " I suppose I 'm qualified to answer that , " said Mrs. Harold Worden of Illinois . " I 'm a high school teacher . I was recruited as a high school student . I was drawn to the profession , but I have to admit that today 's Stu dents are not The reason , I suppose , is that our teachers themselves are dissatisfied . Their attitudes show , and the students draw the condusion . " Next , the analysis and recommendations of the pre ? liminary state conferences of New York and New Jersey were presented by Foy Cross , Professor of Education at New York University . The conferences , he reported , had pointed to public badgering , to low pay , and to the working conditions ' of teachers that are so markedly inferior to those in business and other professions. , " Well , " said Charles McCrary , a hosiery manufac turer and school board chairman from Ashboro , North Carolina , " maybe the need is to glamorize the profession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why should n't teachers do the same ? " But Mrs. Worden interrupted , " The youngsters are n't in the hos ? pitals , but they are in the schools . They have their eyes open and they see . " T HE recorder for this session was George Connell , a lean Southerner who is President of Mercer Univer ? sity in Macon , Georgia . He laid down his pen . " One reason why children are no longer attracted to the teach ? ing profession , " he said , " is the attitude of the profession itself . " " The professional , " Connell continued , " is one who has achieved such competencY in his work that the lay public no longer feels qualified to pass on his authority , I 'm not fool enough to challenge the competency of my doctor ? and yet 90 percent of the public think they can teach better than the teachers themselves . The public must recognize that teaching is a profession that demands respect . " " Well , " answered Cross , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations , remember , have fought to prevent even the worst teachers from being fired for incompetency . They must establish and enforce minimum standards for their profession to win respect . " " I train teachers , " Connell persisted , " and the fact is that the folks that choose teaching are far from the brightest . " " And yet , " said Hochwalt , " you ca n't tell them that they 're not bright . " " Or that they must be happy , " Hersey added . " You know , " said Dr. John Whinnery , a superin ? tendent of schools from Montebello , California , " it always annoys me to think that teaching is the profes ? sion that has first whack at recruiting the children in order to perpetuate itself . And yet it fails . It has n't the spirit today . " " And why not ! " added Whinnery . " In my district we have 750 teachers and principals-64 of them are gradu ? ates of our own high schools . In five of our schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in junior high , and when they get to senior high they spend one day a month helping our teachers with the younger children . Our communities were influential in pressing the state to grant scholarships of $600. a year for teacher training . And seven years ago , our teachers , out of their own , pockets , established one scholarship each year . " " Our teachers have prestige , " Whinnery added later in the discussion . When we announce 80 positions in teaching we have 500 applicants . It reflects the warm - relationship established between teachers and parents through the interviews that we provide on the kids . " But President Connell held to the opposite view , " There 's an expression down my way that you hear every NEW REPUBLIC Wednesday morning in the classroom , " he remarked . " It 's ' Two more days , CFTG ' ? Come Friday thank God ! " Still the problem of ? the teacher shortage remained . " If a man did not have a doctor 's degree , " ventured Mrs. , Worden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a need . If we refused to allow substandard teachers in our schools , if we left the rooms vacant , then maybe that would start something . " " I 'm afraid that this is intoler ? able , " said Hersey sadly . " Society would n't stand fot , it . " " When we get salaries in line , " suggested Milan Ryder , Chairman of the Board of Education of Weiser , Idaho , " then we will recruit . " And table 90 's report af firmed , " It is axiomatic that in the minds of young people financial remuneration determines their respect for a par ticular profession . " ? And yet table 90 , like the other 165 tables , conceded that salaries are not the sole answer . Whinnery spoke of the poor working conditions of teachers , the lack of freedom after school hours , the ex hausting indignities of menial work . " On , weekends , " he remarked , " teachers gravitate to metropolitan areas ? to lose their identities . " He concluded , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Later , in the chairmen 's conference , ' Hersey rephrased the thought . " It all comes back , " he said , " to the living image of the teacher in the classroom and the changes that are de manded in her life and her work . " The chairman 's con ferences agreed . The final conference report began with Hersey 's phrase , " The American public must be re awakened to the fact that teachers work with our most precious resource -- our. children . " It called for new pres tige and status for teachers , for a salary structure , " high enough and flexible enough to compete effectively with ' other fields bidding for quality manpower . " It endorsed the Future Teachers Clubs , the extension of scholarships ( without specifying where these might come from ) , the enlistment of all community agencies in the recruitment . of high-school teacher candidates . It insisted that teach ? ers show enthusiasm . All these no doubt are desirable . But they are ' all within the framework of existing con ? cepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let alone the qualitative needs of our schools . tcT HAVE a sinking feeling , " Hersey remarked toward the end of table 90 's discussion , " that we are not doing the creative thinking that is demanded of us . " It was a fair comment . The fault in part lay with the conference directors . For in asking " How can we get enough good teachers ? " they ignored the essential addi ? tion " ? and fully use their talents . " One sentence in the conference report pointed to the problem : " The teacher 's job must be so defined as to challenge and attract the interest of talented people . " But Of this novel idea no more was heard . Our present standards of ? public education are plain ly intolerable . And yet , when the enrollment prospects of competent teachers , are checked against the demand , the teacher shortage seems insoluble today . It can be met only , if 51 percent of all college graduates go into teaching for the next 10 years , and obviously neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the White House Conference are going to achieve this result . If the present methods of training and using teachers are continued , a progressive deterioration in educational standards must follow at every level of our schools . The alternative is a re-examination of the broad ques ? tion of the utilization of manpower in education . It points at once to the paradoxical contrast between teaching and every other profession in American life . In every profession but teaching , the productivity of skilled professions is rising . In medicine , for example , we had one doctor for every 600 citizens in 1900 ; we have one doctor for 800 citizens today . And yet our standards of medical care have risen sharply . The reason , as in most other professions , is that training and ability are more productively used . ProTessional nurses have taken over the less skilled tasks of the doctors while the less skilled tasks of nurses have been taken over by nurses ' aides . In education , in contrast , the teacher serves 25 percent fewer students than in 1900 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their school day on house ? keeping and clerical tasks that require little or no pro- fessional , competence . In every profession but teaching ; moreover , produc ? tivity and ability are closely related . In any high school , in contrast , the best teacher and the worst will be found using the same textbooks , following the same methods , reaching the same number of pupils , and receiving the same rewards . In his cavalier manner , Dwight Eisen ? hower mentioned three years ago that teachers ' salaries should be doubled . And Vice President Nixon reminded the delegates to the White House Conference that col ? lege graduates who enter teaching in New York earn substantially less than the drivers of trailer trucks , while in Detroit , carpenters make $4,846 a year in. contrast to the $3,862 received by beginning teachers . Interesting as these contrasts are , however , they miss the point . It is that 41 percent of doctors and surgeons work up to in ? comes of over $10,000 , while less than one percent of school teachers earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are acutely aware of the necessity for rewarding ability . And some of the sharpest ex ? changes among the round tables concerned the problem of merit increases in teachers ' salaries . No consensus was reached and ? the best that the final conference report could do was to attach an endorsement for " further studies or research on merit increases for teachers " at the very end of its catalogue of needs . The reason for this evasion is plain . For generations educators have fought for uniform salary structures in the schools ? regardless of the size of the schools and of classes , and of the sex of teachers . They have succeeded only too well Today teachers ' salaries are uniformly based on two rigid stand ards : the years that the individual has taught , and the number of college credits he or she has managed to accumulate . The ambitious and able teacher who needs more income has one place to go in education ? to get out of teaching altogether and to move over to school ad ? ministration . Obviously teachers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason debate upon merit increases is futile . The alternative is to reorganize the salary structure , creating a series of classifications that begin with teachers ' aides and move on through appren ? tice to master teachers . For the best teacher , of course , pay ' is not the final incentive . The obstacle to recruiting individuals of ability is that the radius of impact of all teachers , good and bad , is the same . The full utilization of available ability points to broadening the radius of impact of outstanding teachers through co-operation between schools and by the use of open and dosed circuit television . And edu ? cation which has been so lacking in experimentation is exploring these methods of conserving and utilizing teachers ' skills . The White House Conference , however , was not intended or equipped to do creative and bold thinking in this field . 12 ? to state hands . It agreed further that restrictions should be removed on taxing , and eased ( but not removed ) on borrowing authority . It recognized however that none of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Con ? nell , " 82 cents in every tax dollar goes to our universities and schools . The state has taxed itself up to the limit of its powers . " " Should the federal government increase its financial participation in school support ? " Connell had a written answer ready for that question in the Conference agenda , " If equal educational opportunities are to be made avail ? able , " he read , " the federal government must provide some'of the resources . " At once Frank Balcerzak , a builder and member of the Board of Education of Mankafo , Minnesota , intervened . " I do n't go along with that ! " he declared . " Yes , you do ! " answered Connell , " or rather , your state does ! You 're taking 50 cents from the federal gov ? ernment right now for every 50 cents you spend for vocational training iii agriculture and for trade schools under the George-Deen Act and the Smith-Hughes Act ! " " Well , not in secondary education ! " insisted Balcerzak . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Morris Shapiro , a member of the Mayor 's Ad ? visory Committee on Education from New York City , read out -a statement endorsing federal aid without fed ? eral control . Balcerzak broke in again . " It just is n't work ? able ! " he cried . " What Senator or Representative in New York is going to go back to his ? constituents and say ' Friends , I 've achieved the ultimate ? through my efforts we 're sending our tax money out of our state with no strings attached . ' What 's the reaction of New York going to be to that ! " " Pretty good , pretty good , " said Mrs. Shapiro and Hersey together .. " I ca n't see it , " said Balcerzak , " not beyond the areas where the federal government has great landholdings or where it 's disrupted communities with atomic plants . " So table .90 recorded its inability to agree on the terms of federal aid and passed on . " If federal funds are provided , " the conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all states or only to the less wealthy states ? " " To areas of proven need , " suggested Mrs. Shapiro , but Monsignor Hochwalt shook his head . " I 've lived for many years in Washington and spent more time than I care to remember in the Capitol . Every state has to be eligible ; every appropriation bill has to have a pork barrel feature or it wo n't go through . " Mrs. Shapiro explained , that New York has " proven needs . " For operation ; for building construction , or for both ? " asked the Conference agenda , speaking of federal funds . " For whatever is necessary , " answered Connell . He read the statement of the preliminary state confer ence held in Georgia . " Federal aid without strings at ? tached should be provided . " " No strings attached , " replied Connell serenely . " I ca n't go along , . with that ! " cried McCrary . " Nor I , " echoed Ryder . " There 's not a state in the union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum effort ! " Mc ? Crary cried . For a moment the calm spirit of table 90 seemed in doubt . " Perhaps , " said Monsignor Hochwalt , " this is the time to make our position dear . " " We favor legislation for school construction without conditions . We are leery of the pork barrel feature , but we are perfectly sure that if aid is given it will be with ? out discrimination among the states . We would favor federal aid for school operation on the condition that where aid to non-public schools is legal it be made mandatory for bus rides , for medical services , and per ? haps for text books as well . " Some time later Mrs. Shapiio recorded the view held in New York that aid should be limited to states corn-plying with the Supreme Court 's ruling on segregation . " That , " muttered McCrary , " will kill it for sure ! " " It has three times , " said Monsignor Ho , chwalt who , when asked , replied that he would not press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when federal aid failed in Congress on the ' segregation issue , Catholics had been falsely held to blame . Connell disagreed . " I 'm a descendant of Roger Williams , " he declared grandly , " and a strong advocate of the absolute separation of church and state ! " " I agree , " said Hochwalt , smiling ; he voiced his support of the plan proposed by Beard sley Ruml , which allocates federal aid to qualified schools , on a per capita basis for each child . HERE was little argument in the group , and no ran ? cor . Granting the divisions , it came at last to a show of hands . The group favored federal aid for construc ? tion in areas of proved need . Three members supported school-operation aid . " Now , " said Connell , " those who favor aid on Monsignor ? Hochwales conditions should vote accordingly . " " We shall do that , " said Father Ap ? plegate , and the two priests . held up their hands . " Have you got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorder for this session . " Yes " said the school super ? intendent , " except that I ca n't spell unanimity . " . " And you a product of the ' old system ! " remarked Connell . At 7:30 on Wednesday evening the chairmen of the round tables met to combine their reports on the after- noon 's discussion . And here the disorder caused by the poor scheduling became apparent . The chairmen met in the third-floor bedroom suites of the Sheraton Park , and down the length of . the green-carpeted corridbrs cries of bafflement and confusion ? came from the open , doors . " We were split down the middle .. we divide five ways ' .. . six favored . . . three opposed . . . Mr. Chair ? man , ca n't we . . At . 9:30 the chairmen chosen at DECEMBER 12 , 1933 each of these sessions were due to move on to the semi ? final chairmen 's conference with their reports . But at 10 the din was undiminished . " Five tables said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it this way ? . . let 's start all over . " It was 10:30 before the two groups of chairmen that made up the second to last conference met . Edgar Fuller , Executive Secretary of the Council of Chief State School Officers , was elected Chairman of the first group . He swallowed an aspirin and went to work . The group labored over local and state financing , and at 11:55 Fuller asked : " Shall we go on to federal aid ? " ' I dare you ! " said Bice Clemow , a Connecticut pub ? lisher , laughing . Slowly , the chairman tabulated the votes from each table and weary reporters huddled on the floor , half-asleep , as deadlines came and passed . At last , at 2:15 the stand of the conference was deter ? mined on federal aid . The final report declared : The participants agreed by a ratio of more than two to one the proposition that the federal government should increase its financial participation in public edu ? cation . Of those favoring such increase the overwhelm- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building construction . On the issue of federal funds to the states for local school operation the par ? ticipants divided almost evenly . A very small minority was opposed to federal aid to education in any form . So through the cumbersonie procedure of the confer ? ence , a demand for a new course in education made itself felt . No such firm conviction had been expressed at the preliminary state conferences , where the educationists were in a small minority . Eyen at this conference , set ? ting aside the 600 educationists and the 100 trade union delegates who were already committed , the lay delegates who voted were evenly divided even on federal aid for construction . In their messages to the conference the President and Vice President had phrased their endorse ? ment of federal aid in weasel words . And influential Re ? publicans on the White House Committee insisted that the President still does not favor action . But now the course seems set . the White House Conference has a trend that is historically inevitable . In 1954 we spent $9.5 bil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . By 1964 we will have to spend four percent of our national income , or $20 billion a year , on educa ? , tion simply to prevent a further deterioration of our schools . Two billion dollars of the extra $10 billion that is required may be found through local reassessments and state sales taxes . But the rigidity of local restrictions , and the limits of taxation on local property mean that Con ? congress must vote the largest share . In the last session of Congress the Kelly bill , provid ? ing $1.6 billion in federal aid over four years , passed a House committee . In the coming session a comparable bill may well be supported by both parties . The paro ? 13 thial school issue is unlikely to prevent the enactment . Nor must the segregation issue mean its death . For the Southern delegates at the Conference were instructed to press for aid . And the . Negroes were moderate and far ? sighted men Who are patient , believing that time is on their ' side , and that executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From now on then , the pressure for federal aid is likely to increase until it becomes a key issue . in American politics . The formidable clich ? " federal aid with no federal con ? trol " remains . Obviously the federal government is not going to pour its tax money down the drain of schools that are poorly built and run. - Nor is it likely to pour federal funds into a school system in the South that is constructed to keep white and Negro pupils apart . And yet the experience of social security indicates that the federal government can serve the individual without shaping his thoughts and . actions . The conference in which 500,000 citizens participated amounts to a call for hard thinking on the responsibilities and limits of federal participation . And perhaps one section in the conference report on Topic 5 , drafted by Bice Clemow , is the kernel of its success . " The delegates , " it declares " almost un ? animously opposed any federal control over , the educa ? tional use of funds in . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the federal government for fiscal pur ? poses was not interpreted ' as federal control - of educa ? tion "
