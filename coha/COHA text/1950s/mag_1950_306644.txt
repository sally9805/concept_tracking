London still waited eagerly for T.S . Eliot 's verse play , The Cocktail Party , now in its tenth sold-out week on Broadway . Meanwhile , it was busy doing homage to a meteoric new playwright , who , like Eliot , had turned the trick of making poetic drama a sizzling box-office hit . A year ago , few even in London literary circles had heard of Christopher Fry . Last week the name was marquee magic that packed two theaters with customers of all brow heights . The plays : Fry 's Venus Observed , produced , directed and acted by Sir Laurence Olivier , and his <P> Ring Around the Moon , which Fry adapted from the French of Jean Anouilh . <P> Fry 's work , which earlier this year kept four London theaters busy at once , had driven critics close to poetry themselves to do him credit . After seeing The Lady 's Not For Burning , with which Actor-Manager John Gielgud introduced Fry to the public last spring , the Sunday Times 's Harold Hobson wrote : " It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jests with Stardust , and is witty in iambics . . . He is a master jeweler . " <P> All of Fry 's plays are witty and rich in imagery , scant of plot , roundly romantic in temperament ; some are medieval in setting and steeped in the religious quality of his Quaker 's faith . <P> The Lady 's Not For Burning will be brought to Broadway next fall by the Theatre Guild . A Phoenix Too Frequent , a one-acter , now rehearsing in New York for a late April opening , will be his first to reach the U.S. <P> London intellectuals are carrying on a running debate as to whether they have a new Shakespeare in their midst or just a particularly brilliant writer to be rated somewhere between Noel Coward and T.S . Eliot . For his part , 42-year-old Fry is taking his success with the same equanimity he has shown through slim years as an actor and schoolteacher . With his wife and twelve-year-old son , he still lives in a 6s. - a- week cottage in a Cotswold village , 28 miles from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He works through the night by kerosene lamp , drives to London , only when he has to , in a small , secondhand car . <P> Like Eliot , to whom he acknowledges a great debt , Fry believes that verse in the theater should sound like colloquial conversation and " still rise to the dramatic occasion when you need it . " In discussing poetry in a recent broadcast , he also displayed some off his gift for it : " Poetry is the language in which man explores his own amazement . It is the language in which he says heaven and earth in one word . It is the language in which he speaks of himself and his predicament as though for the first time . It has the virtue of being able to say twice as much as prose in half the time , and the drawback , if you do not . . . give it your full attention , of seeming to say half as much in twice the time .
