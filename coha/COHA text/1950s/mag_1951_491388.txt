Lightning Joe , the GI 's General By HAROLD H. MARTIN " Moving fast saves lives , " says Gen. Joe Collins , Army Chief of Staff , who demands a force that can win battles without sacrificing men . He likes to see Arlington Cemetery from his window  --  it reminds him he 's responsible for the safety of our sons . O N Ernest Hemingway 's novel Across the River and Into the Trees , Mr. Hemingway 's hero , the colonel , is talking to his girl friend , the contessa , whom he calls " Daughter , " about the last war and the generals who fought in it . The colonel , who had been a brigadier himself once , was not pleased with some of the generals and spoke of them with asperity , causing the contessa to ask : " Were there no good ones ? " . " Yes , many , " the colonel said . " . . . Give you Lightning Joe as a good one . Very good . . . very sound . Rapid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loftier brass alike who have read this passage concede that Mr. Hemingway , in his staccato style , has done a fine thumb-nail sketch of the character and the talents of four-star Gen. Joseph Lawton ( Lightning Joe ) Collins , once the spectacular battle leader of World War II 's famed 7th Corps , now Chief of Staff of the Army . As a corps commander , Collins did , indeed , consistently outguess , outmaneuver , and outpunch the best generals of the Wehrmacht , a tribute to the soundness of his tactics . As for rapidity of action , the nickname " Lightning Joe " ? " Joe Lightnin " ; to the troops  --  was fixed upon him for the speed by which the forces under his command rolled back the Japs on Guadalcanal and New Georgia in the Pacific war , and on t he European side belted the Germans bowlegged from the Normandy beaches to the Elbe . " Moving fast saves lives , " Collins says . " Stopping to dig in gives the enemy a chance to dig in too . " Collins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically . If anything , his driving sense of urgency has increased . Old war horses who have served their country well are sometimes apt to look upon the Pentagon as a quiet pasture where they can browse pleasantly through the years until they retire . Collins , instead , still moves at a spanking gallop , ceaselessly sniffing the battle afar off . He runs his office like a front-line command post . He is vastly impatient of sloppiness and inaccuracy , as one young officer learned who , when asked a question , began his answer with " Sir , I presume ? " " Dammit , " said Collins testily , " when you come in here , you do n't ' presume ' anything . You either know the facts or you do n't . " A silver-haired Irishman with a bright blue eye and a smooth , unlined countenance , which in repose looks more like the face of a contemplative priest than that of a fighting soldier , Collins at fifty-four is not only the top administrator of the Army , he is its foremost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to have a stronger Army , with deadlier weapons , if we are ever to live in a peaceful world . Most military men , no matter how profoundly they know their jobs , are relatively inarticulate . Collins is not only a voluble conversationalist but a compelling speaker ? there is no case on record where he has ever been at a loss for a word . Showmanship , Collins knows , is an essential part of leadership . Though he has never had the flamboyance of a Patton or a MacArthur , he has never sought to make himself inconspicuous . The infantry , as the stepchild of the armed forces , needs a spokesman willing to stand up and be seen and heard . Collins is entirely willing to fill that role . He is a verbal artilleryman who is always ready to lay down a barrage of facts , figures and apt illustrations in support of the foot soldier . Around the Pentagon , where the Indians of the lower echelons spend much of their spare time analyzing the character of the chiefs  --  in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Collins is a man who vastly piques their interest and tests their sharpest insight . There is no room for argument about his pre-eminence as a leader . The admiration felt by the men who have served under him in battle attests to that . Partisans attribute his rapid rise ? he was a " boy major , " a " boy colonel , " and one of the youngest men to hold the office of Chief of Staff  --  to his thoroughgoing preparation for his job , his energy , and his insistence on thoroughness in himself and all who serve under him . Associates , groping for a word , always end up by describing him as a perfectionist . They illustrate their point by recalling the way he rehearsed the wedding of his daughter , Gladys May , to Jerome Joseph Stenger , Jr. , until the complex ritual of the nuptial mass went off with the precision of a military drill . Detractors would add to his obvious virtues certain other attributes  --  brashness , a vaulting ambition and ability to walk with surefootedness the tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less admiring alike , though , sum him up roughly thus : He has the iron integrity of Secretary Marshall without Marshall 's august and retiring dignity , the political acumen of Eisenhower without Ike 's suavity , and the forthrightness of Bradley without Bradley 's humbleness . He is also an outspoken optimist , a man stout of heart in the face of military disasters . When the UN Forces in Korea were backed against the Pusan beachhead he flew to the battle zone and came back with the unqualified declaration that they would hold and not be driven off . In December , when hordes of Red Chinese were driving our divided armies toward the sea , he flew again to Korea and came back to announce publicly that the retreating forces could take care of themselves , and that the days of serious losses were over  --  the only cheering word uttered by a high official during that grim retreat . The talents he possesses he utilizes to the utmost . Each morning at 8:25 his black limousine pulls up to the Mall entrance of the Pentagon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his secretarial staff with a formal " Good morning " ? rarely a warmer inquiry into the state of their health ? by 8:30 he is at his desk , a monumental mahogany antique , heavily carved , which once was used by William Tecumseh Sherman . On the lightgray-green walls hang penciled sketches , not of the high brass , but of the gaunt and muddy soldiers of World War II . Through the windows at his back he a can see the green slopes and white gravestones of Arlington , the National Cemetery . " I am glad I can see it there , " he says . " It reminds me that I am dealing with men 's lives and that the burden rests on me to see that in time of war they shall go into battle so well armed , well trained and well led that loss of life will be as low as it possibly can be . " Concern for the welfare of his men is particularly strong in Collins . An associate who was with him in Germany recalls his conversation with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quoted as saying , " These men are in Your hands . Their fathers and their mothers , their wives and their children want them back . War is war and we cz n't take all of them back alive and unhurt . But I wo n't have them thrown away . If a man handles his troops badly , I 'll relieve him in a minute , no matter how close a friend he is . " Collins is brusque with officers who fail to come up to his standards , but deals gently with the erring enlisted man . In Europe he was violently opposed both to looting and to fraternization . When he would catch a soldier carrying off some Hausfrau 's feather bed , he would n't order him punished . He would give him a lecture on how everything destroyed or stolen would eventually have to be paid for by the American taxpayer  --  that meant money out of the soldier 's pocket , and his dad 's pocket . Then he 'd make him take the mattress back . " When he 'd catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subordinates recalled , " he 'd take their names and then go chew hell out of the division commander for the sloppiness of his discipline . " Collins ' first task in the morning is to read the many dispatches that have come in from overseas during the night . After he has gone through the dispatches on a Monday morning , members of his staff come in to brief him on the matters to be taken up at the Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting , which starts at two o'clock that afternoon and ofttimes lasts until well after dark . Tuesday he has a meeting of the Army Policy Council at 8:30 A.m. , followed at ten o'clock by a meeting of the Armed Forces Policy Council . At 1:15 P.M. all the secretaries and the Chiefs of Staff meet with Secretary Marshall at a luncheon which often goes on until well up into the afternoon . Collins usually does not leave his office for lunch , but has a trz6 , brought in , so that he can continue with his paper work as he eats . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toasted sandwich of bacon , lettuce and tomato , and a chocolate milk shake . Standing five feet nine and a half , and weighing in at 167 pounds , Collins shows no signs of developing either jowls or a paunch , though he is a good trencherman . He is very fond of sweet desserts , and at home takes saccharin in his coffee , believing that by denying himself sugar he can take a second helping of pastry without damage to his figure . On Wednesday at nine o'clock he is briefed again on the agenda of the JCS meeting , which begins at 10:30 and lasts for two hours . Wednesday afternoons he hopefully sets aside for golf at the Chevy Chase Country Club , where his eighty-five to ninety-five score is usually good enough to win or lose him a few small bets with Maj. Gen. Floyd Parks , the Army Chief of Information , Lt. Gen. Ed Hull , Chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project , and Lt. Gen. Ray McLain , Army Comptroller . Since the Korean war , he has rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Thursdays , after another session of the Army Policy Council , where a raft of detail is considered , he calls in the General Staff secretariat for a meeting . These are rough sessions for the hired help . When a specialist makes an error in a fact or figure , Collins barks at him sharply . Friday begins with a short meeting with Secretary of the Army Frank Pace , but most of their get-togethers are less formal . Both are voluble talkers . When they hold a joint press conference , the newspapermen lay small bets as to which one will steal the limelight . These meetings , of course , are only the bare bones of Collins ' routine day , and free moments are filled with special conferences and with a tremendously heavy mail . Some days it seems that every wife and mother who has a loved one in the armed services has a problem she must take up with the Chief of Staff . Collins can not personally dictate an answer to all these letters , but he insists on seeing the replies prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the average day he gets away from the office around 6:30 , but Mrs. Collins never lets the cook start dinner until she hears by phone that the general has left the Pentagon . It takes about fifteen minutes for M/Sgt . Ed . Davis , his wartime jeep driver , to drive him to the two-story brick house that sits beside the Potomac on the officers ' line at Fort McNair . Once home , Collins showers , slips into civilian slacks and , if it is not too dark , goes with his wife for a stroll along the river , watching the sunset on the water and striking up casual conversations with ( Continued on Page 121 ) ! ) I LIGHTNING JOE , THE GI 'S GENERAL ( Continued f Page 21 ) beauty-loving soldiers he may encounter engaged in the same pursuit . Back home while waiting dinner , he sips one Scotch and water  --  never more  --  and plays with a fourteen-yearold tabby cat named Muffy , a valiant feline warrior of whom Collins is extremely fond . Shortly after dinner Collins climbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has brought home and works until midnight , dictating into a wire-recording machine . He often shows up at the office the next morning with enough dictation to keep four secretaries busy for half a day . Until recently Collins went regularly to his office on Saturday and Sunday , but not long ago Mrs. Collins persuaded him to build a neat but unpretentious hide-out on Chesapeake Bay  --  at a place called Scientist Cliffs because learned scholars of the Smithsonian used to dig there for relics of a prehistoric race . Collins digs for no artifacts , but works prodigiously at landscaping , transplanting both trees and shrubs , and he chops wood with great earnestness . He is handy around the house , touching up the paint here and fixing a loose screen there . He tries to get away every week end and sometimes leaves the Fort McNair house full of guests when he takes off on Friday afternoon . He is , of course , on call . But the only standing order he leaves is that the sports section of the Sunday New York Times shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available on Saturday night . At the cottage , , which is called both Jayhawk Rest and Jayhawk Roost  --  Collins ' Headquarters code name in Europe was Jayhawk  --  he finds the leisure to prepare , in his mind , the many speeches which he delivers both to the public and to the troops . He is convinced that the public should be told all that it can possibly be allowed to know . Some people in the Defense Department sometimes feel that Collins talks too much , revealing secrets that an officer of lower rank would be court-martialed for spilling . Collins ' mention in a radio interview that we are deeply interested in developing artillery weapons that would shoot a projectile carrying fissionable materials caused a great flap in the Pentagon . Collins also travels widely , lecturing , giving the troops a comprehensive view of where they stand in the defense picture . " You ca n't kid the troops , " is one of his favorite phrases . Unlike some members of the high command , who have a staff of brilliant young ghosts to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fact-finders and figure-gatherers . Usually he speaks from only rough notes , and even when he is appearing before the House Armed Services Committee on Capitol Hill his prepared report is for the record and his testimony is largely extemporaneous . He is an extremely self-assured witness . Congressmen are notorious for their habit of interrupting with long , obscurely phrased questions which often throw witnesses into confusion , but Collins will not permit himself to be sidetracked . " Wait a minute , " he will say firmly to the honorable gentleman interrupting . " Let me finish what I started to ( Omit it on Page 123 ) ( Continued from l'age 121 ) say . " He will then pick up his testimony and go on with it , unperturbed . This does not seem to exasperate the members of the committee , for they have publicly commended Collins for the calmness , the logic and the reasonableness with which he has presented the Army 's point of view in the B-36 squabble , the unification fight and many budget hearings . Collins is particularly effective in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , science and industry are the three equal bases of our national security . He has a sharp grasp of the political , economic and military factors in international problems . On a trip to the Middle East he rendered great service to our foreign policy by explaining to King Ibn Saud that the amount of the help this valiant and battle-scarred old warrior wanted from us needed re-examination . Though Collins lives , breathes and dreams the problems of the foot soldier , his mind is many-faceted , and he is probably the only top military leader in this country who genuinely loves and understands good music . He is a consistent attendant at the Whittall and Coolidge chamber-music concerts at the Library of Congress , where some of the loftiest long-hair music in America is played , and he still possesses a love for poetry . He carried a small volume of Keats with him through the campaign in Normandy and in idle moments restored his sense of values by rereading the Ode on a Grecian Urn . " When he was a little boy , he would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about saying it over and over , greatly boring us all , " his sister , Mrs. Allen L. Vories , of Washington , recalls . " When he got into mischief , mother would punish him by taking away his library card . " Mrs. Vories , a distinguished-looking elderly lady noted in Washington for her work for the prevention of blindness , believes that Collins ' personality is a curious blending of the diverse character of his father , Jeremiah , a military-minded Irishman who joined the Union Army in Cincinnati as a drummer at the age of sixteen , and his mother , who was a Lawton of Louisiana , the Lawtons being a gentle , philosophical , music- and book-loving family . Collins was the tenth of eleven children of Jeremiah , who came to Algiers , Louisiana , shortly after the Civil War and over the years built up a prosperous country store there . Young Joe 's Collins aggressiveness and his Lawton love of beauty were in evidence early . He was always glad to fight boys larger than himself . At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streak uncommon in small boys . " He used to summon us all to the back gallery to see a lovely sunset , " Mrs. Vories recalls . " ' Come out here , all of you ! ' he would shout peremptorily . ' Come see the sunset ! It 's glo-o-o-o-r-r-r-rious ! ' " Collins also revealed an early aptitude for assuming a position of author ' ity and then finding the words to back up his decisions . Sisters of the Holy Name of Mary School , where the Catholic youngster got his early education , remember him , at an age when most small boys knew no words of more than two syllables , umpiring a baseball game and bellowing firmly , " That 's three consecutive strikes ! You 're out ! " May Collins Vories , who feels an elder sister 's warm affection for Collins and still refers to him sometimes as " my little brother , " believes that she was in a measure responsible for his enduring love of music and for his choice of the military as a career . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano , he would sit entranced . Collins had already gone to Louisiana State University when his sister decided that he should follow in the footsteps of his older brother , James Lawton Collins ? now a retired major general  --  and go to West Point . She went to see their congressman about an appointment , but was told that the principal had already been named . He would , he said , be glad to appoint young Joe two years hence . May pondered this , " said a quick little prayer , " and asked for the first-alternate . Miraculously , the principal appointee failed , and Collins was accepted at West Point . Collins did well enough in his studies , but he was not a paragon of virtue , disciplinewise , taking punishment several times for " turning out " upper classmen , a process requiring him to creep into their rooms at night , roll them from their sacks and douse them with cold water . As an underclassman , he had a leaning toward the artillery , but was converted to infantry in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spoke eloquently of the satisfaction of working with men instead of horses or cold machinery . Graduating in 1917 , the baby of his class by reason of having been born four hours later than beardless Classmate Mark Clark , Collins asked for duty with the 22nd Infantry Regiment , on the hunch that this outfit was soon to be shipped overseas . The guess proved wrong , and Collins sat out the first World War training troops in this country . Later he went to Germany to command a battalion of the Army of Occupation at Coblenz . There , at a dance , he met a beautiful , black-haired girl of English lineage named Gladys Easterbrook , the Phi Beta Kappa daughter of the occupation-forces chaplain . Love bloomed apace on long horseback rides beside the Moselle and the Rhine , where Collins and Miss Easter-brook would ofttimes draw rein to read poetry to each other . But since Collins was Catholic and his fiancee was Methodist Episcopal , their marriage was delayed a year and a half while religious obstacles were ironed out . Finally , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage has produced three offspring , Lt. Joseph Easterbrook Collins , a paratrooper , and two daughters , Gladys May and Nancy Katherine Collins . Collins returned to the States and began the long course of technical and advanced schooling that officers undergo in time of peace  --  Infantry School at Fort Benning , Field Artillery School at Fort Sill , Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth , Army Industrial College and Army War College at Washington . On summer leave , he added to his slender pay by teaching horseback riding at a fashionable girls ' camp in North Carolina . The time he spent at Benning he regards as the most profitable of his career . Marshall was there , a colonel then , and Omar Bradley and Vinegar Joe Stilwell , and the four used to get together at Marshall 's quarters and talk of the high art of leading men in battle . Marshall , who had a way of asking questions that stimulated thought , led the discussions . When World War II broke out , Collins was as ready as a man could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first duty was at Pearl Harbor , where , as chief of staff to Gen. Delos Emmons , he reorganized the defenses of the Hawaiian Islands , earning himself a brigadier 's star and a Distinguished Service Medal . A year after Pearl Harbor , a major general now , he went to Guadalcanal as commander of the 25th Division , his old mentor , Marshall , by now Chief of Staff , reportedly Haying he did n't care what division went , so long as Collins was in command . Collins ' division relieved the 1st Marine Division , and spearheaded the final assault that overwhelmed the Japs . In the process he proved that American troops could maneuver in the jungle as well as the Japs , and that tanks could be used away from the beaches . The speed with which his troops operated earned the 25th the name of the Tropic Lightning Division , and Collins himself , who drove about in a command car marked with a jagged streak , became known to his men as Joe Lightnin ' . Here too he earned his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , machine-gun and mortar fire on the front lines . His later exploits in Europe have been widely publicized . His VII Corps took Cherbourg and spearheaded the 1st Army 's breakthrough east of St. LO and blocked the German counterattacks at Mortain while Patton poured his 3rd Army through the gap and ran wild with his tanks . Driving north into Belgium with infantry , armor and airborne troops , Collins broke through the Siegfried line to take Aachen . The corps then drove with the 1st Army to the Rhine , crossed at Remagen , and led the attack that enveloped the Ruhr . Collins then drove on to the Elbe to link up with the Russians . He was fighting much of this time under his old friend Omar Bradley , who was often heard to complain , " Collins is a good man , but I am afraid I am going to lose him . He crowds the front too much " ? a complaint that Eisenhower was also making about Bradley . During one narrow brush with death , Collins ' thoughts were far from war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cottage where he and Mrs. Collins had spent their honeymoon . He was standing there looking at the rubble of the war-wrecked cottage with tears in his eyes when the Germans across the river opened up on him and his driver with machine guns . He left the scene in great haste , with bullets whanging past his head . Collins came out of Europe with oak-leaf clusters added to his Legion of Merit and his Distinguished Service Medal , and with another Silver Star for gallantry for exposing himself to fire while directing a river crossing . His first peacetime job was as chief of staff of Army Ground Forces , where he could do little but sadly watch as the world ' s greatest army melted away in what Collins still calls " that dreadful demobilization . " He then moved up to a job he did n't want , but for which his flair for public speaking made him well suited  --  Director of Information of the War Department ? the Army 's press agent . Collins was Chief of Information at a time when there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obstructionist tactics her diplomats pursued . His speeches reflected the Defense Department thinking of that day . He bore down strongly on the fact that we must not be stampeded into setting up a military establishment that would wreck our economy . Since that time the Korean war has come , the threat of other brush-fire wars has loomed , and the clouds have darkened ominously over Western Europe . While he still feels it essential that we maintain the strength of our economy , Collins ' speeches now reflect less concern over the economy and instead stress the fact that we must build , train and arm powerful ready forces if we hope to survive . Three problems , as he sees it , face the Army today ? manpower , weapons and morale . Before Selective Service went back into operation we were able to maintain an Army of only 594,000 men by volunteer enlistments , though our authorized strength was 630,000 . Since the present situation makes it imperative that we maintain far larger forces than that , Collins says bluntly that Selective Service , tightened up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in force for many years to come , and that the training of the men selected must be far tougher than we required before in peacetime . Selective Service has taken one great burden off the Army . It no longer has to wheedle and cajole to get men into uniform , and it can make its training as tough as necessary . Before Korea great stress was laid on the pleasant side of Army life  --  the neatly tailored uniforms , the good chow , the movies and PX 's , the Old World courtesy of the new-type noncom . Security , not soldiering , was the theme song of recruiting posters . Collins , whose concern for the enlisted man is boundless in war or peace , did not object to this softening of the foot soldier 's life , for he feels that the best the country can provide in the way of creature comforts in time of peace can not compensate the infantryman for the misery , the pain and the danger that he must undergo in battle . And he saw no reason why the lures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfere with a rugged training program , once he was in . On this point he was soon disillusioned . The volunteer soldier wanted the emoluments all right , but he did n't want to do much crawling around on his belly in the rain and the cold , learning his trade . Outfits that trained hard in the field soon found their re-enlistment. rates dropping alarmingly . Those days are over , to Collins ' great relief . With Selective Service keeping the hopper full , the training is as tough as it can be made  --  as tough ( Continued on Page 126 ) ( Cont . I from Page 121 ) as it has to be if men are to go into battle able to take care of themselves . " The troops we are calling up now are n't going to have it easy , ! ' Collins says . " They are going to have the most thorough combat training we know how to give them . We wo n't just bang them over the head with it , though . We 'll tell them why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world today , and what might happen , and the part they must play if it does happen . You can lead an American , but you ca n't drive him , as old Von Steuben found out when he came over here to train Washington 's troops . " The tougher training program is well under way . Troops now go through infiltration courses with machine guns firing close above their heads , artillery shells falling near them and bombs dropping close to their lines . Two men have already been killed in these realistic exercises , but so far there has been no violent public protest , as there has been in the past when such methods were used . " People must understand that we are in a dangerous business , " Collins says . " Inevitably there will be accidents . We provide every possible safety device , but there 's always human error that ca n't be foreseen , and one little mistake can cause a tragedy . Despite its hazards , though , this type of training eventually will save many lives . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest danger of wounds or death for the longest period of time , Collins has long felt that the foot soldier of the line battalions should receive the same extra pay for hazardous duty that the airman receives . He sees no reason why the branch of the service which , in any war we 've fought so far , has suffered more than 90 per cent of the total casualties , should not receive some extra reward . The problem , of course , is money . The Army at the moment needs all it has , and all it anticipates getting , for the procurement of new weapons it sorely needs . Great advances have been made in the weapons field since the last war , but until very recently the Army has been using the same guns , tanks and projectiles it used in World War II . Some new stuff , such as the 3.5-inch bazooka and a new tank-killing projectile , came along just in time to save us from early disaster in Korea , but much we could have used over there was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons has caused some tankers to mutter that he has lost his faith in armor . Collins says this is nonsense . " Russia , " he says , " is reported to have 40,000 tanks . This makes it absolutely imperative that we should have the finest antitank weapon we know how to make , and I 've done all I can to push it . But that does not mean that the Army has lost faith in the tank itself . In the last war I commanded two of our great armored divisions in combat  --  the Second and the Third  --  and I know what they can do . I 'm just as enthusiastic about the tank as I ever was . " The tables of organization of a postwar infantry division call for 150 tanks . That 's as many as we had in a light-armored division during the war . We are developing a new light tank , a new medium and a new heavy . We are getting some of the new lights now . We 'll have some of the mediums at an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them against the Pattonswhich is really anew tank using the old Pershing hull  --  and see which is the best . We 'll get some of the heavies also at an early date . Some people said we did n't have any good tanks in Korea . We did have only lights there at first , for the bridges of Japan would carry only light tanks . But when the mediums got into action , with their guns firing a new armor-piercing projectile , they knocked out every Red tank they came up against . " Collins says that the Army is making further improvements in its antitank weapons , even in the 3.5 , which , rushed to Korea by air , stopped the Red tanks . New antitank ammunition for the 105-mm. howitzer is being developed , and we are working on an antitank projectile for even larger calibers . These are fin-stabilized projectiles which spin slowly , for a shaped charge does not work in a fast-spinning shell . These projectiles , he thinks , will be particularly effective against distant tanks that are massing for an attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also being developed as an antitank gun . Collins is particularly enthusiastic about the 3.5 bazooka . " That thing , " he says , " is deadly , just deadly . If you can infiltrate men using this weapon into a tank park at night , they can just play hell . I think it would prove effective against any tanks in the European theater . The good thing about antitank weapons is , they are cheap . The bazooka is cheap , the recoilless weapon is relatively cheap , the new ammunition for the standard artillery is cheap  --  easy to manufacture , no trick to it . This holds great promise for the people of Western Europe . It means that with a reasonable expenditure they can have forces ready to meet a great number of tanks . Of course , they 'll have tanks too . And we are confident that the tanks we can provide them will be a match for any they 'll ever come up against . " Collins believes the Army needs to develop far more than it has the techniques of transporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been made in this field , for we now can haul 105-mm. guns and jeeps by air and drop them ready to go into action . But paratroopers need both heavier artillery and heavier transport . They particularly need an air-transportable tank , and we now have the prototype of a plane which can carry our new light tank . Collins knows that the Air Force will probably never be able to tie up millions of dollars in a great fleet of transport planes . For that reason he believes that the Government may ultimately have to subsidize the commercial air lines in their cargo operations . If this were done , he thinks , there would be a thousand or so big freight-carrying planes that could be converted to military use in the event of war . Collins is particularly concerned with the Array 's need for antiaircraft guns with which to defend the continental United States against atomic attack . During the last war we had some 500 antiaircraft battalions . At the end of demobilization , all but fifteen battalions had gone into moth balls . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves are good , but they need new radar-controlled firing and pointing mechanisms if they are to be effective against the faster planes of today . Hurriedly , the Army is equipping the larger calibers  --  the 90 's and the 120-mm. ' s ? with the faster-acting control mechanisms , and a new family of smaller-caliber AA guns is either on order or under development . One of these is a quick-firing 60-mm . Stinger for use against low-flying planes , and the other is the 75-mm . Skysweeper , already under procurement , which goes after planes at higher altitudes . And because some modern bombers may fly beyond the range of guns , we 'll soon be testing an antiaircraft rocket that will go above 60,000 feet , Collins says . We are also working on guided missiles of great range and altitude , some of which can be used as antiaircsaftweapons , and others against troop concentrations and supply dumps . Used as ground-to-ground weapons , Collins sees these electronically controlled devices as an important addition to the arsenal of Western Europe , should the relatively small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onslaught of masses of men and tanks . Collins is also convinced that the atomic bomb can and will be used as a tactical weapon against ground troops . " We are greatly interested in the possible application of atomic warheads to guided missiles , " he says . " We are also interested in developing an artillery piece that could fire a shell carrying fissionable materials . We are working on both these things and they show great promise . Against the great concentrations of men and armor that we might have to face in Europe someday , they should be devastatingly effective . " Collins believes that the guided missile , either with or without the atomic warhead , may become an important adjunct in extending the range of artillery support of ground troops , taking over at night or in bad weather when planes ca n't fly . He is also ready to lead a move on Capitol Hill to obtain for the Air Force more money with which to build up their strength in support aircraft , the fighter bombers that work with the infantry . Complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the close support from the Air Force which they needed were justified , Collins believes . The reasons were simple . There were not enough close-support aircraft to go around . For this he feels that the Army , as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , must bear its share of the blame . " What I 'm hoping is that we can get at least one group of fighter bombers in the Air Force for every combat division in the Army , " he says . " That will give us a reasonable proportion . We know the techniques of close support . In the last war my troops got excellent air support all the way from Normandy to the Elbe . " The Army , contrary to the opinions of some nervous Air Force partisans , has no desire to have its own organic close air support , Collins says , but he does believe that the ground forces ought to have some say-so in the kind of plane used for close support , and the method of use . The present jet may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time over target and weight of bombs , and the jet as it is today does not fulfill those requirements , " he says . " Yet I do n't agree with those who say that the slower , prop-driven job is the answer . The prop planes could n't live if the enemy was using jets . Somehow , we 've got to work out with the Air Force a plane that meets both our requirements  --  a plane that can carry a heavy load and stay over the target a long time , and still can take care of itself in a fight . " ' Whenever Collins speaks of the other services , he is always quick to inject the idea that there is no quarrel between them and the Army . As an infantryman at heart , he sincerely believes that the ultimate decision in war . . . the imposing of our will upon an enemy . . . can be gained only by a ground army , supported , of course , by tactical aviation and with supply lines guarded by a navy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " And no Air Force can win . But neither can a ground Army win without their powerful , specialized support . A man 's loyalty to his country should transcend his loyalty to his branch of the service . There is no quarrel between us . We are all one team . "
