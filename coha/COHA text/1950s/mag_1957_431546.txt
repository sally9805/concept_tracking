 | THREE DAYS OF SILENCE THAT SAVED A LIFE @# At the San Francisco Chronicle that Saturday afternoon , January 16 , 954 , we were in the lull between editions . The day city editor leaned back , his feet on the desk . Two reporters played chess , with kibitzers . I waited for the nod to go home . Then a phone rang . The editor reached lazily over : " City desk . " He listened , scribbled on a pad ? then his feet hit the floor . " We 've got a kidnaping ! " he shouted . The place came alive in seconds . Soon I was pounding out a bulletin for an extra : Leonard Moskovitz , 36-yearold realtor , was kidnaped shortly before noon . A ransom note demanding $500,000 reached the home of his father , Maurice Moskovitz , prominent civic leader , 2900 Lake Street , by special delivery . The note said he was being held by five men . No Chronicle subscriber read that bulletin . Nor , for three incredible days , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | progress . Before our presses could roll with the extra , Capt . James English , chief of police inspectors , had called our city desk and every news agency in the city . " Call off your men , " he entreated . " A man 's life is at stake ! " The ransom note , he explained , warned that Leonard Moskovitz would be killed if the police or press were notified . How that voluntary news blackout held became the most amazing story I have handled in a quarter century of newspapering . The Moskovitz brothers , Leonard and Alfred , were familiar figures in San Francisco . Identical twins , just five feet two inches tall , they lived in adjacent identical houses in Burlingame , ten miles down the Peninsula , and their San Francisco realty office was called The Twins . Leonard had left the office at 11 that Saturday morning , telling his father , their business associate , that he was going to see a Mr. Lund . He had another appointment at i p.m . Around t : 3o this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His father worried for an hour or two , then called the police . At 5:30 Leonard 's mother phoned the real-estate office : she had just received a special delivery . . . some men were holding Lennie . . . they wanted $500,000 ... . At police headquarters a routine kidnap bulletin was prepared . But when Captain English , who was off duty , heard the ransom note 's contents , he roared , " Cancel that bulletin . We 've got to keep this quiet . " " The Chronicle 's already on it . " That was when English talked to Abe Mellinkoff , our city editor . Mellinkoff agreed that the Chronicle would hold off ? on condition that every other news outlet pledged to do likewise . There are 21 radio and seven TV stations in the Bay area , three news services , five major newspapers and a dozen small dailies . English managed to contact them all that night and exact a promise from each to cooperate . The Chronicle 's extra was dismantled , and all media in the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalism . Captain English promised to keep the press fully informed on every development . " I 'm really sticking my neck out , " he said . " But I have faith in the press . " To avoid suspect activity around the Hall of Justice , he set up kidnap headquarters in his own home that night ; one room was given over to the press . There the father , twin Alfred and intimate friends were questioned , with reporters as silent witnesses . The elder Moskovitz , aghast at sight of the press , protested , " But the ransom note . . . " " It 's all right , " English reassured him . " We have an agreement . ' fell the boys anything they want to know . " Moskovitz did . Under the cover of a storm , which luckily raged that night , inspectors set up a radio transmitter in the family home at 2900 Lake Street , in Seacliff , overlooking the Golden Gate . Similar transmitters , tuned to  | walkie-talkie frequency , were installed in the twins ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters for prowl cars . At the Chronicle we had saved the type on our bulletin ? just in case there should be a leak . We had to stay constantly on top of the story . I fattened the bulletin with the ransom note , relayed from English 's home . In Lennie 's own hand on cheap ruled paper , it read : " Dear Dad ? I am being held prisoner by five men and they want $100,000 each . Get it for them right away or you wo n't see me again . Do not let the police know or they will kill me if it comes out in the newspaper . As soon as the money is ready put an ad in the Examiner personal column : L. Ready to conclude sale . Please advise when and where to deliver . ' They want $$100,000 in 20 's , $200,000 In 50 'S , $200,000 in Loo 's . All bills must be old . They must not be marked and not in sequence .... I drove across the Bay Bridge to my Berkeley home late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story written but untold . Sunday was a day of developing mystery . That afternoon , with the number of newsmen on the story multiplying hourly , Captain English was forced to move his headquarters to the Hall of Justice , where a special press room could be set up . But for once , on a major story , no free-ranging reporters were poking around in search of angles . English assigned too picked officers to the case . The rest of the 1800 - man police force were unaware of the kidnaping . Even the men pounding beats had no inkling of the crime as they canvassed their districts that Sunday with photos of Lennie Moskovitz . All they knew was that this man was " wanted . " Others checked garages and parking lots for Lennie 's car . They found it in Union Square Garage in the heart of San Francisco . The timecard was stamped 12:31 p.m. , an hour and a half after Lennie had left his realty office . In the middle of the night police towed the car to headquarters where they scoured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car as stealthily to the garage and an officer took up duty to nab any claimant . That afternoon I wrote a complete new story for the Chronicle 's first edition on Monday . A rewrite man hammered out " sidebar " stories : a biographical sketch , the mechanics of the news blackout , a chronology of historic kidnap cases . Two full pages , complete with photos , were stereotyped into plates and hidden near the press under a pile of rags . We were all ready for a big splash ; all that was needed was a bulletin on the capture . Only a half dozen of our printers and a dozen of our 120-man editorial staff knew . Similar precautions were being taken in other news plants all over the city . On outer Lake Street that day a Sabbath calm prevailed . No sign of untoward activity distinguished No.  | 2900 from its neighbors . Inside , inspectors manned their post . Throughout the area plainclothesmen with walkie-talkies cruised unobtrusively in private cars . Then , in the early evening , a brief flurry occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. mail truck is entering the block . It 's stopping out front . The driver is getting out . He 's going up the walk . " The inspectors waited , ready to pounce if the driver proved to be in disguise . But he merely handed over another special delivery letter . It was the second ransom note , also in Lennie 's handwriting . Minutes after its delivery , our reporter at the Hall was dictating the contents to me : " Dear Dad ? It 's Sunday morning and I 'm still alive but please hurry . . . . Remember please they know all the tricks and have assured me that if we play square with them they will let me go unharmed , but if you tell the police before the money is in their hands or try in any way to trap them they will kill me . Nothing has yet been reported in the newspapers for which I thank God . " Down at the Hall , English thought hard . As a lure , and a delaying tactic , he dictated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unable to raise sale price . Wish to negotiate . Please contact us . " He needed a telephone contact ? phone calls can be traced . " It 's a big chance , " he said , " but we 've got to take it . " Doug Hayden , chief special agent for the telephone company , worked out an elaborate detection system . In each of the exchanges serving the three Moskovitz hones and the realty office , a bell was hooked up to ring at a call to anv of those numbers . Twenty technicians , on round-the-clock duty , traced every call and immediately notified Hayden , now constantly at English 's side . Monday forenoon the suspense of the blackout grew suddenly taut . The New York Herald Tribune , on an anonymous tip of a kidnaping " somewhere in California , " telephoned its San Francisco part-tine correspondent , Jack Foisie , a Chronicle staff man . " A kidnaping out here ? " he replied . " Hold the line . " He checked with Mellinkoff and answered , almost whispering , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secrecy . A man 's life is at stake . " Several hours later a major New York radio network picked up the rumor and called its San Francisco outlet . " You ca n't keep a thing like that quiet ? we 're going to put it on the air , " the network representative argued . Frantic , the local station manager had English call New York at once . " If you break the story and this man is murdered , " English said , " you will be held personally responsible . Not by the police . The press here has a stake in this ? they will hold you responsible . " Tempers became increasingly edgy . Would some other paper or station , less scrupulous , smash the story ? What was happening to the kidnaped man during - these tense  | hours ? From details pieced together afterward we learned that he had met Mr. Lund at City Hall that Saturday morning ? a suave , husky gentleman who had called at the realty office earlier in the week . Lund asked Lennie to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realtor obliged . They stopped at a small house in a modest neighborhood . " I 'll wait out here , " Lennie said , but Mr. Lund urged him to " come on in . " Once they stepped inside Mr. Lund 's smiling mask dropped . He shoved Lennie sprawling onto a sofa and another man appeared , flourishing a knife . Mr. Lund , as it later developed , was Harold Jackson , 57 . His confederate was Joseph Lear , 43 , equally husky . There were only two men , not five . Both had once been private detectives , wise to the ways of the police ? and the press . Lear held the knife blade at Lennie 's throat : " One peep out of you and you 'll be dead . " Jackson fettered his ankles and wrists with chains . From that moment on Lennie lived a diabolical nightmare . He lay on a bed , shackled , blindfolded , ears stuffed , mouth taped . At mealtime they chained him to a table ; one of the men always accompanied him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning over Lennie 's shoulder , watching as he formed every letter . The kidnapers spun the radio dial constantly for news and made periodic trips for the papers . After each newscast and newspaper edition Jackson would sneer at Lennie : " Damn lucky your old man 's playin ' ball with us . " He would slide a finger across his throat , while Lear ominously snipped paper with his keen-bladed knife . Lennie was scared . Was his father really playing ball ? He felt sure , once they got  | the ransom , they would kill him anyway . The more depressed he became , the more confident his kidnapers grew . Jackson had been dead set against a telephone contact : " That 's how they always pick you up . " Not Lear : " How can the wires he tapped ? The police know nothing . " The continued absence of news bolstered their confidence . And after they read English 's ad in the morning Examiner , they decided to take a chance . At 12:25 p.m. on Monday Lear phoned twin Alfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hello , 011ie . How much can you raise by midnight tomorrow ? " Alfred tried to stall , but Lear was too cagey : " Get $300,000 . You will receive delivery instructions this evening . Run that original ad in the Examiner . No tricks . The kid 's sick . We want to get rid of him . " He hung up . The call was too brief to trace . English now summoned Lennie 's father to the Palace of the Legion of Honor , an art gallery near Land 's End . " Make sure you 're not followed , " he said . Already assembled were Maurice Moskovitz 's closest friends ? his doctor , a judge , the sheriff , a bail bond broker . No other cars were present . A drizzly fog shrouded the statuary in the parking circle . It was no day for tourists . Moskovitz drove up . English slipped in beside him . " About the ransom ? I 've talked to the others . We are all agreed on a dummy drop . " Anguish sharpened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's love beat back the lob ; i r : " No . If something happens to no ' boy because I did n't follow instructions ... " English became stern . " Maury , if they get their hands on that money , you will never see Lennie again . Who could identify them ? Who could testify against them ? Only Lennie . ' They will have to get rid of him . " But Moskovitz was too fright ened to take a chance . " Please , " he begged , " no phony drop . " So the doctor , judge , sheriff and bail bondsman drove to the Bank of America with Maurice Moskovitz and forthwith pooled their assets , even mortgaging their homes to raise the $300,000 . Kindly bankers , sensing the urgency , readily initialed loans , and tellers ? without knowing why ? started at once the long job of sorting and counting the old bills specified for the ransom . The third ransom note ? most alarming yet ? was waiting when Moskovitz got home : " Please , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I swear to God they mean business . They say they will castrate me if there is any further stalling . Please , Dad , do what they want or they will send my vital parts to show the whole deal is over and I am dead . " I felt a chill as I heard this from our man at the Hall . I prayed the blackout would hold . English called a huddle . Sweat glistened on his bald head as he ordered the specified ad into the Examiner : " L. Ready to conclude sale . Please advise when and where  | to deliver . " He then alerted Hayden that the kidnapers would certainly contact twin Alfred again sometime that night . Hayden in turn alerted all chief phone operators . Alfred 's home number ? Diamond 4-8020-was Scotch-taped on switchboards at eye level throughout the area . " If a call is made to that number , stall ? trace it ? notify me at once , " Hayden said , then added : " This is probably the most important call you will ever handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightened . Would the secret , so well kept for almost three days now , hold ? Slips occur in the best-laid plans ? and some newsmen are as gabby as other people . Early that Monday evening an Oakland reporter telephoned his father in Salt Lake City to wish him a happy birthday and mentioned that the San Francisco papers were sitting on a big kidnap yarn . His father , a newspaper publisher , failed to understand that the message was confidential and phoned his managing editor for details . The surprised editor asked the AP to check . Its query to San Francisco appeared on AP teletypes in newspaper offices along the way : " We have report of $500,000 kidnaping in SF . Anything to it ? " The San Francisco AP bureau manager hit the phone , explained to Salt Lake the need for leakproof secrecy . It was impossible to reach all those who might have seen the inquiry ; we could only hope they would let it pass , Not long afterward a similar query came through from Los Angeles on the United Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was becoming intolerable . A moderate smoker , I was consuming cigarettes by the pack . It was after i a.m. when I got home . Around four my phone rang . It was Mellinkoff : " There 's a break ? get over here fast ! " The Bay Bridge , creeping with traffic by day , was all mine at that hour . I made the 12 miles to the office in as many minutes . The Chronicle local room was cold , cheerless . Regular editions had gone to press hours ago . Only eight of us had been called in . The reporter at the Hall rattled off flash-facts . I wrote a fast paragraph to lead the long-held story for the first extra . Then more facts : Shortly before i a.m. ? now Tuesday ? Lear had called Alfred Moskovitz ' home and put Lennie on the phone . Alfred stalled for time . " What do you think of when I say one , two , three , four , five ? " he asked . " Why , that 's the date we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied ? " December 3 , ' 45 . " Lear , nervous , broke the connection . But thanks to Hayden 's efforts the call could be traced to the Sunset district . At once English deployed prowl cars to that area . At 2:45 a.m. a light flashed on Claire Moon 's board in one of the district telephone offices . She plugged in and said , " Operator , " then stared fascinated at the Scotchtaped number in front of her , " It 's  | that Diamond number ! " she whispered to the chief operator , clamping her hand over the mouthpiece . Then , while the chief operator alerted Hayden and tracers went to work , Miss Moon asked , " What number are you calling from , please ? " Then , stalling again : " I 'm sorry . What number did you say , please ? " Then she put through the call . It was Lear . He instructed Alfred on the ransom drop : ocean beach near the old windmill , Golden Gate Park , 8 a.m . W hen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Get him back ? quick ! " shouted the chief operator , hoping to gain time . Miss Moon 's cord was still plugged in . She rang back . Amazingly , Lear answered . " One moment , please , for overcharges . " Abruptly she heard scuffling , then an urgent voice came on : " This is the police . Get me headquarters ! " Miss Moon 's delaying action had paid off . Inspectors Al Nelder and George Murray , cruising the Sunset district , had chanced to spot Lear 's shadowy figure in an outdoor curbside booth . Why Lear stopped to answer the phone no one knows , unless he was one of those people who automatically answer a phone ring . But that was all the time the police needed to nab him . Nelder realized that any delay in Lear 's return to the kidnap house would arouse suspicion ? and mean curtains for Lennie . When Lear refused to talk , Nelder put it to him cold : " It 's bad enough now . But if this turns into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lear talked . Nelder radioed English , who , it ranged a rendezvous a block from the hideout . Three carloads con verged on the spot . Approaching t he house on foot , in the cemetery still ness of the hour , they sounded like an army on the march . English called a halt , whispered hoarsely : " Take off your shoes ? all but Lear ! " As they surrounded the house , Lear 's footsteps echoed on the porch . Nelder , gun drawn , crouched low at his back . Lear rapped the code knock . Jackson opened the door . Nelder kicked it wide , jabbed the pistol in Jackson 's ribs ... . My heart sang as I wrapped up the story for our morning extra : " San Francisco 's biggest kidnap case ? a tightly guarded secret for three days ? broke wide open early today .... " Soon the news was flashing across the nation in newspaper headlines , radio , TV . It was to be followed later by a report of swift justice for the kidnapers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty , subsequently commuted to life . Meanwhile , at the jubilant predawn reunion with his son at the Hall of Justice that Tuesday morning , white-haired Maurice Moskovitz exclaimed through unabashed tears : " I love all you wonderful people ? the police ? the press ! " Said Captain English : " This was true freedom of the press ? the freedom to withhold news . "
