txt There is an obvious link between the unusual amount of time Khrushchev has recently devoted to satellite affairs and the resurgence of dictatorial forms in Eastern Europe . Plainly there is no gathering crisis within the Soviet empire . But just as plainly , Khrushchev intends that there shall be no such crisis as a result of next year 's summit meeting . In 1955 , when the Big Four chiefs of government last met , they accomplished little of a concrete nature . The division of the Continent remained unchanged . There was not even a glimmer of agreement on Berlin or Germany . And , if Khrushchev pretended to be serious about reducing tensions , this was largely sham . For , while he talked with his Western colleagues , his agents were negotiating the first secret arms , deal with Nasser . The 1955 summit more or less affirmed an armistice in the war that no one dared to fight . Nevertheless , if that first summit produced only a zero with a rim on it , this halo was the appearance of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union of the Stalinist type of dictatorship , this inspired a wave of popular optimism among the Soviet satellites . And that optimism eventually led to explosions in Poland and in Hungary . The Polish and Hungarian upheavals almost destroyed the Soviet. , empire and almost cost Khrushchev his job . He managed with ruthless efficiency to restore what he considers order . But , in so doing , he exposed the blatant fact that no matter how much his interpretation Hof communism might seem to differ from Stalin 's , it was built on the same foundation of force . This was a damaging admission for Moscow to make just as it sought to persuade other lands of Russia 's benign new look . Obviously Khrushchev intends to take no risks this time that a second summit conference might inspire a second wave of troubles in Eastern Europe . Therefore he is not only traveling about his satellite domain but he is bolstering the position of that domain 's political regimes . Khrushchev 's Pragmatism This does not mean either that bosses one might label " Stalinist " are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Khrushchev 's is a pragmatic approach . He wants merely to strengthen existing administrations , check up on their internal security arrangements , and make certain that the lids are firmly clamped on any simmering pots of trouble . As a result we can see certain related developments in Eastern European lands . Gomulka is slowly smothering the remarkable freedom of thought and opinion that had been permitted in Poland during the past three years ; and he is restoring to high position party lieutenants known as tough disciplinarians . In Hungary , where Khrushchev attended the first party conference since the 1956 revolt , he took pains to bestow public approval on Premier Kadar . But he coupled this , approval with the assurance that Soviet troops would not be withdrawn . This scotched a wave of hopeful rumors that the Russians might get out . Even in Bulgaria , a loyal and supine ally of the Soviet Union , pre-summit preparations have seemingly made it necessary to restore to some degree the position of that unpopular Stalinist boss , Chervenkov . No changes seem to be needed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the satellites , these are the two least likely to express political sentiments by violence . The process of tidying up the administration of an empire has grim implications for the citizens of that empire . But it is , from Khrushchev 's point of view , a wise precaution . It will enable him to speak with even more than usual assurance next April when he presses once again for formal Western recognition of his position in the East . One may be confident that Khrushchev 's diplomatic bargaining strength will be at a peak when negotiations start . We , in the West , on the other hand , have no imperial problems to settle . But we do have a restive alliance to be recomposed and harmonized before its leaders meet the Soviet boss . And it is far less certain that such harmony can be restored than it is certain Khrushchev will have insured against the slightest chance of trouble in his European realm when he goes to Geneva in the spring .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
