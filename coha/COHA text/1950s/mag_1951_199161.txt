Shortly after Evensong one evening last week , a man in an overcoat climbed to the lectern of St. Paul 's Cathedral and pointed a pistol toward the great dome . No one made a move to stop him . Two shots , shattering the gloom of the church , made a noise like an artillery barrage booming across nave and transept . For twelve seconds the reverberations echoed . <P> The man with the pistol was an engineer , demonstrating with blank shells what London churchgoers have known for generations-that St. Paul 's acoustics are abominable . Sir Christopher Wren 's imposing structure , completed in 1710 , has never been right for psalms or sermons . Fine phrases bounce off the high stone walls , sound in some spots like garbled incomprehensible Latin . " Acoustically , St. Paul 's is the worst cathedral in Europe , " admits the Archdeacon of London , the Venerable O. H. Gibbs-Smith . " Except , of course , St. Peter 's in Rome . " <P> In times past , various public-address systems have been tried . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest contribution of science to the celebration of religion . He spoke into the pulpit microphone and his words were carried to the crypt , where they were recorded on a magnetic disk . After appropriate delays ( 1/10 , 1/20 and 1/40 of a second ) , they were rebroadcast from strategically located loudspeakers . The timing was such that the recorded speech reinforced rather than interfered with the words that came straight from the pulpit . Echoes were all but drowned out. * The result was faintly hollow and mechanical , but intelligible . <P> Although there are still troubles to be ironed out ( e.g. , too much amplification feeds sound from loudspeakers back to microphone , causing a loud , cacophonous howl ) , churchmen were favorably impressed . Now congregations should be able to listen to historic chants , sermons will sound as if they actually come from the pulpit , not from the older loudspeakers that were spotted under seats and in other improbable locations . The engineers , said Archdeacon Gibbs-Smith , have been clever enough to preserve " the sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine worship . " <P> <P> *St . Paul 's most famed echo , in the Whispering Gallery , still echoes .
