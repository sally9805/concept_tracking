Over rutted Brazilian jungle trails last week jounced a task force of clay-spattered , green-and-yellow jeeps , carrying as incongruous a crew as ever penetrated the steaming wilderness . They were securities salesmen , hardy young men carrying briefcases , who were on their way to sell a 208 million-cruzeiro ( $1.6 million ) issue of stock in Willys Overland do Brasil to back-country natives who had never even heard of Wall Street . <P> Fighting dirt , dysentery and distrust , the salesmen are specialists in a unique investment operation known as Deltec S.A. Founded by a hard-driving Princetonian ( ' 35 ) , Clarence J. Dauphinot Jr. , 44 , Deltec has pioneered in raising investment capital in Brazil to develop new industries for the country and set a pattern that others are copying . Dauphinot , a onetime Wall Street foreign-bond trader , got interested in the project during trips to South America for Kidder , Peabody &; Co. during World War II . He found that while Brazilian industry was starving for capital , money was stagnating in savings accounts and sewn-up mattresses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know-how , " says Dauphinot , " except a very basic one-the formation of capital-marketing techniques . " <P> <P> Sign the Mayor . Dauphinot left Kidder in 1946 and formed Deltec S.A. in Rio de Janeiro . Initial capitalization : about $2,500 . His first deal was to sell a 15,000,000 cruzeiro ( $750,000 ) stock issue for an American &; Foreign Power Co. subsidiary . With a sales crew of 25 , Dauphinot began a door-to-door selling campaign . But after six months , only about half the issue had been sold , and all but one salesman had quit . The undaunted survivor , Paulo Quartin , son of a Brazilian diplomat , doggedly kept at the job and succeeded , by year 's end , in selling the remainder of the issue . <P> Dauphinot sold a new American &; Foreign Power issue , took on the job of selling stock of other companies . He found that often the trick was to get the most prominent citizen in a village to buy . For example , when the mayor in one town bought , 17 others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , became Brazil 's most active stock underwriter , was doing business in New York , Colombia and Venezuela . All told , Deltec has sold stock to some 50,000 Brazilians , 80% of whom , Dauphinot estimates , had never owned stock before . The buyers put their money into such Brazilian subsidiaries as Squibb , Dunlop , Willys , General Tire , Lone Star Cement , I.T . &T.; and Brazilian department-store , telephone , textile , cement and steel companies . Dauphinot 's salesmen also sell investment trust shares for as little as 100 cruzeiros ( 77 ) . <P> Dividends : 25% . Most Deltec issues have paid the average Brazilian dividend or better-10%-25% of par value plus stock splits . Though its expenses are high , Deltec has found the operation profitable . The fees for underwriting a stock issue in Brazil average 15%-20% of the value of the issue ( U.S. average : 2%-3% ) .
