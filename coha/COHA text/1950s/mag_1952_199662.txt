The million-odd Basques in northern Spain are Spaniards mainly by geography . As one of Europe 's oldest national minorities , *they have fought for centuries to keep their identity distinct from their Spanish neighbors , who had conquered the Basque provinces by the 16th century . During the Spanish Civil War , the Republican government granted the Basques autonomy , and thereby got most of them on its side . After the war . Generalissimo Franco returned to the older <P> Spanish policy of trying to stamp out Basque culture and traditions . <P> Politically powerless , the stoutly Roman Catholic Basques have rallied around their church as the last champion of their national rights . Their clergy , unlike the Spanish church , was overwhelmingly anti-Franco in the Civil War ; the Franco government , in reprisal , executed 1.7 priests , imprisoned many others , and exiled the Basque Bishop of Vitoria . Although new Spanish bishops were sent to three Basque dioceses , the local clergy remained rebellious , went on teaching the catechism in the Basque language and talking about Basque national traditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's government . <P> Mountain Monastery . Two years ago a group of Basque pastors began to publish a semi-clandestine mimeographed magazine called Egiz ( Basque for " truth " ) , in which nationalistic as well as moral problems were openly discussed . It was highly successful . Each laboriously circulated issue found its way to some 50,000 readers . When the three Spanish bishops told the priests to stop publication , they ignored the order . The bishops then decreed that any priest connected with Egiz would be suspended . Reluctantly , some weeks ago , the priests yielded . <P> Last week hundreds of Basque parish priests gathered for devotions and conferences at the mountain shrine of Our Lady of Aranzazu , by tradition the patroness of the Basque nation . For more than 500 years Aranzazu 's monastery has been a wellspring of Basque culture . It remains so today . Its 128 cloistered Franciscan friars are outside the jurisdiction of the Spanish bishops . Although armed civil guardsmen are posted around their monastery , Franco 's government has never dared to invade it . <P> Cassock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monks still turn out books and magazines in the Basque language . In their trips through the countryside , they work quietly to preserve the Basque consciousness of their people , as well as certain moral freedoms generally overlooked in the rest of Spain . A year ago , during serious anti-government strikes in the Basque provinces , Spanish bishops were warning priests to tell the people that such striking was a mortal sin . One of Aranzazu 's Franciscans , speaking from the pulpit , countered : " The right to strike without violence is a right granted by God as one of man 's natural freedoms . "
