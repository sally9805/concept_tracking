Pennsylvania 's Hugh Scott Jr. , 52 , is a sixth-term Congressman whose 1948-49 stint as Republican National Committee chairman was marked by more noise than victory . Once a Tom Dewey partisan and more recently a member of Eisenhower 's personal campaign staff , Scott last week complained that some Republicans in Congress are acting like " quarreling old women , " and a few are " old fuds , " * blocking the Eisenhower program and thus endangering G.O.P. election prospects . Writing in the American Magazine , Scott named to his " fudocracy " : in the Senate , Wisconsin 's Joe McCarthy , 43 , Nevada 's George W. Malone , 63 , Idaho 's Herman Welker , 46 ; and in the House , Illinois ' Noah Mason , 71 , Michigan 's Clare Hoffman , 77 , and New York 's Dan Reed , 78 . <P> More noteworthy than Scott 's by-name attack was the mildness of the retorts . Like cows flicking off summer flies , Scott 's " old fuds " answered back . Said headline-grabbing Joe McCarthy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to do is call McCarthy a name and you get your name in print . " Hoffman said he had merely " attempted to protect the President from some bad advice that would have led him down the path blazed by New Deal Democrats . " Malone advised Scott to " settle down " ; Mason said he opposed Eisenhower 's program only " where I thought it was wrong . " And from his home in Dunkirk . N.Y. , old Dan Reed , who lost a slugging match to the President on excess profits taxes in July , said of his relations with Ike , " We are very close friends . " Of Scott 's grumble , Reed chuckled : " Well . Hughy 'll say darn near anything for publicity . " <P> <P> * Webster defines " fud " as : 1 ) the buttocks ; also , tail of a hare , cony , etc. ; 2 ) woolen waste , for mixing with mungo and shoddy .                @ @ @ @ @
