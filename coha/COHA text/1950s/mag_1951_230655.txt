When Adventurer Thor ( Kon-Tiki ) Heyerdahl and his comrades visited Papeete , Mrs. Arlette Reasin , a Tahitian planter 's wife , welcomed them with a hula , later sued Heyerdahl for $150,000 because he included pictures of the dance , without permission , in his book 's movie version . Last week a Los Angeles judge dismissed the suit , decreeing that Mrs. Reasin 's artistic efforts were " in effect , a gift . "
