Nine nations-Cambodia , Nationalist China , Indonesia , Japan , Korea , Laos , the Philippines , Thailand and Viet Nam-got $767 million in U.S. economic and technical assistance in fiscal 1956 , the International Corporation Administration reported last week . South Korea , which maintains 20 army divisions , got the biggest slice : $327 million . <P> The figures underscored a dramatic eastward shift of U.S. economic attention . In 1953 Europe got 66% of the nonmilitary aid and Far Eastern nations only 12% . In fiscal 1956 , Asians received a whopping 58% . Non-Communist Europe , with its technical and economic houses clearly more in order , was down to 8%.
