txt Rudolph Halley as President of the City Council and a member of the Board of Estimate is enlivening the summer scene with some critical comments on city policy as to its transit system . Nowhere has Mr. Halley spoken a truer word than when he says , of the transit problem , that " what is necessary is leadership . " The Mayor 's own approach to the problem has been faltering and indecisive . Mr. Halley , while deserving good marks for exploratory ideas and the independent examination his staff has made of a segment of bus operations , has remained adamant in his position against a fare rise . He thus makes sure , politics being what it is , that the Mayor too will continue to support the ten-cent fare , no matter what damage it does to city I solvency . One basic trouble is that there are too many bosses in transit . It is absurd to say that the Board of Transportation is " autonomous . " The fact is not a single important change of policy would be considered without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Mayor 's signature on a fare rise . The Board of Transportation would not even think of hinting at the need of a fare change without getting the signal from City Hall . Wages , hours , other labor policy , new construction all wait on the Mayor 's say-so or , in some cases , that of other city agencies . The result is that public transportation in New York is run not as a business but with an eye on election returns . City-owned transit is presided over by a committee , the Board of Transportation . Col. Sidney H. Bingham is an operating man ; his colleagues on the Board are not . The question may fairly be asked at times whether the Board is really running transit ? sometimes the fransport Workers Union seems to be in charge . Civil service considerations are also a factor limiting exercise of authority . It is a curious fact that nobody in authority now rises to declare that municipal operation is more efficient than private operation . Chairman Bingham was the motivating influence behind the stalled effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Board of Estimate , including the Mayor , was willing to go along . Mr. Halley wants to shear the Board of Transportation of operating power , and farm the operation out to private management on an incentive basis . We have lost one vital , compelling force for efficency and solvency in transit by abandoning the principle that the city transit system must meet operating costs out of fares . Paying debt service of over *70,000,000 a yeas out of taxes can be defended . But when you toss away the yardstick of a balanced budget on operations , then there is no standard to strive for . The present ferment of discussion is healthy . Perhaps it will find a solution . One question raised , the policemg of the subways , is getting immediate study . Logic and public interest suggest that this function should be vested in the Police Department . Expert study has said so before . This is just one more instance where the city hires experts and then largely ignores the advice paid for .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
