FORTY-EIGHT years ago young Luigi Salzarulo left the village of Bisaccia , high on the mountain spine of Italy . As he departed for America the gentle ringing of the church bell seemed to say , " A rivederci ? Till we meet again . " Later , however , an earthquake cracked the bell in Bisaccia 's campanile and the people were too poor to have it recast . In the summer of 1953 a grayhaired American arrived in Bisaccia to attend a festa . Life had been kind to Louis Salzarulo . Over the years he had advanced from a penniless immigrant to freight-train master for the Pennsylvania Railroad in Richmond , Ind . He had sent all six of his sons through college . At 70 , retired on a pension , he still kept busy in civic affairs . Now Bisaccia 's 7000 people had gathered in the piazza to hear the Archbishop of Conza bless the bell that Salzarulo had had recast for them in memory of one of his sons , an American major killed during World War II . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed that the ceremony was over . But his townspeople ? on both sides of the ocean ? had a surprise in store for him . In the town hall the  | parish priest drew back a drape of Italian and American flags and . asked his guest to translate the English wording of a bronze plaque . Choking with emotion , the onceilliterate immigrant read : " From the people of Richmond , Indiana , to the people of Bisaccia , Italy , in recognition of the high esteem in which we hold your native son and our fellow citizen , City Councilman Louis Salzarulo . " In all but details , the story of Councilman Salzarulo might well be the story of most of our citizens of Italian birth or descent . Italians formed the last , and largest , of the great waves of immigration that broke upon our shores ; four and a half million of them entered our doors before the tide finally ebbed in the early 1920 's . These ItalianAmericans have given their muscles and their hearts and their sons to their adopted country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and song , in cuisine and customs ? that has made all Italy a little bit American and given all Americans some share in the great Italian heritage . Ever since Columbus , sons of Italy have played a large and continuous role in the history of the United States . Italian explorers serving under foreign flags were frequently recorded , mistakenly , as Britons , Frenchmen or Spaniards . Thus John Cabot , who first planted the British ensign on American soil , was born Giovanni Caboto , in Genoa . Giovanni da Verrazano , who explored New York harbor 85 years before Henry Hudson " discovered " it , was a Florentine sailing for France . Cofounder of Detroit and its commandant for ten years was Alfonso Tonti , whose daughter was the first white child born there . At least eight of the priests who founded the Spanish Missions in California were Italians . As early as 1622 the Virginia Company sent 16 Venetians to Jamestown to set up a glass works " for the making of beads for trade with the natives . " The Dutch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Castle , Del . Other Piedmontese came to Georgia in the early 1700 's to set up mulberry plantations and a silk factory . In Revolutionary days William Paca , believed by many authorities to be a great-grandson of one of the early Italian settlers of Maryland , was a signer of the Declaration of Independence . Philip Mazzei , a native of Florence who migrated to Virginia in 1773 , wrote a series of ringing articles in the struggle for independence . " All men , " he declared , " are by nature created free and equal to each other in natural rights " ? words later used by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration . Over the following seven decades Italian artists designed and executed hundreds of bronzes , marbles and murals for public buildings in Washington , D. C. Most renowned was the fresco painter , Constantine Brumidi , who spent 25 years creating the historical murals in our Capitol .  | Jefferson turned to Italy when he suggested the recruitment of Italian musicians to expand the Marine Corps Band . Ever since , most of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art was Luigi Palma di Cesnola , a Civil War general who had won the Congressional Medal of Honor . When he took the post in 1879 the Museum was little more than a grandiose paper project . When he died in 1904 its collections were among the world 's finest and it : influence had led to the founding of other art museums in almost every major American city . With the 188o 's the artists and craftsmen coming from Italy began to be outnumbered a thousand to one by peasant farmers , anxious to leave the overpopulated , eroded regions of Sicily and the lower half of the Italian boot . By the time they arrived , the free land of the U. S. frontier had been almost entirely taken up . Too poor to purchase established farms , they gravitated into teeming colonies in our industrial centers , the natives of the same oldcountry region or village clustering together out of sheer loneliness , often following the same occupation . Thus almost all Italian icemen and coal dealers in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met an Italian knife-grinder , he probably came from the town of Campobasso . Most of these immigrants could qualify for only the humblest kind of labor ? ditch-digging , asphaltlaying , hod-carrying . Their poverty and their numbers ? up to 15,000 arrived in a single day at the immigration peak ? disturbed some Americans who doubted whether this country could absorb such vast hordes of seemingly ill-equipped peasants . They need not have worried . In the free air of the New World unsuspected wellsprings of adaptability and talent were released with explosive rapidity . In a single generation millions of Italian-Americans have come to occupy positions of distinction in every field of endeavor . In sports they first broke through to prominence in boxing , where even the unlettered might succeed if they had enough brawn , coordination and drive . About 1910 a fiery little featherweight named Joe Carrora began making the rounds of the fight clubs . " Who ever heard of a fighter raised on spaghetti ? " roared the matchmakers , who were used to Sullivans , McCoys and McTigues . One manager finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on condition that he change his name to Johnny Dundee . After his first bout the name did n't matter ? Dundee won by a knockout . He ended his long career the undefeated champion of his class . Soon other ambitious kids emerged from the Little Italics of our cities to follow the same trail . Among them were Cannonball Martin , born Vittorio Martino ; Lou Ambers , whose neighbors knew him as D'Ambrosio ; and Packey O'Gatty , whose birth  | certificate read Pasquale Agate . In recent years many Italian fighters , such as Tony Canzoneri , Fred Apostoli , Rocky Graziano , have won championships without benefit of pseudonym . The current heavyweight champion , a division where experts long predicted that stocky Italians would never excel , is Rocky Marciano . It took Italian-American youngsters only a few years longer to reach the top in big-league baseball . By 1932 Tony Lazzeri of the New York Yankees made the annual All-Star team selected by the Baseball Writers ' Association . Soon fans were discussing the relative merits of Vic Lombardi , Dolph Camilli , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 30 major leaguers of Italian origin , representing seven and a half percent of the bigleague roster ? twice the proportion of Italian-Americans in our total population . Distinction in college . football came as another milestone . It measures both the eagerness of young halo-Americans to acquire higher education and the increasing ability of their parents to afford it . The first Italian names to appear on the AllAmerica rolls were those of Getto of Pittsburgh in 1928 and Carideo of Notre Dame in ' 29 and ' 30 . During the 1954 season such outstanding players as Ameche , Guglielmi , Varrichione and Consentino sparked their teams on college fields . Meanwhile other Italians were revealing a genius for enterprise . These were the padrones : interpreters , employment agents , contractors , politicians and labor leaders all rolled into one . They supplied labor gangs to railroads and road-builders . On pay days they accepted small savings deposits , and some graduated into banking . Outstanding was A. P. Giannini who , amid the ruins of the San Francisco fire , set up his Bank of Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank was financing vineyards , truck farms , coal routes and restaurants for Italians in California . Today it serves non-Italians as well . and is known as the Bank of America , with more branches than any other bank in the country and among the top four in deposits . loans and assets . Thousands of other business ventures started in the same way , by meeting the needs of fellow Italians . Small eating places in Italian neighborhoods , for instance , were soon discovered by non-Italians with appreciative palates . More and more American mouths watered for chicken cacciatore , minestrone , cannelloni. ravioli , scaloppina , veal parmigiano and a host of other Italian specialties . There are now more than 15,000 such restaurants , some in communities where other Italian influences have scarcely penetrated . Importing firms bring in olive oil and cheeses . Supermarkets carry scores of varieties of Italian foods . from antipasto to zucchini . Pizza pies , recently put out in quick-frozen form , have been popped into the ovens and onto the dinner tables of  | millions of American homes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits of its Italian citizens . As their consumption of milk and meat mounted , the children grew taller and more slender than their parents ; the grandchildren are turning out to be taller still . In music the " new " Italian-Americans literally surged to success . Song burst naturally from their untutored throats , and this gift they passed along to their children . To the children also they gave the best musical training they could afford out of scanty and irregular earnings . And again , in one generation 's span , the youngsters rose to the top . Just to recite their familiar names is to tell the story : Rosa Ponselle , Mario Lanza , Frank Sinatra , Perry Como , Liberace , Guy Lombardo , Ted Fiorito , and literally hundreds of others . Teaching , singing , playing and writing music , they have rocked the rafters of the Metropolitan and set the teen-agers dancing to a million juke boxes . Small wonder that the president of the Musicians Union is named James Caesar Petrillo , and that in fully a dozen recent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Shoemaker " ? the lyrics are sung in Italian . The college-educated children of the " new " Americans have gone on to distinction in the professions . In New York City alone , for example , there are more than 2500 lawyers of Italian descent . A number of them serve as judges . Some 15,000 Italian-Americans have become physicians and many are leaders in their fields . Among New Haven 's Italian-American physicians , for example , ten percent hold professorships at Yale . And last October Dr. Antonio Pisani , son of an immigrant Italian shoemaker , was designated " outstanding general practitioner of the year " by the Medical Society of the State of New York . In the academic world ItaloAmericans have spread beyond the teaching of Italian or art or music . One of our foremost authorities on the English language is Professor Mario Pei of Columbia . Professor F. J. Bruno is Professor Emeritus of Washington University 's School of Social Work . Pietro Belluschi is Dean of the School of Architecture at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . These are but a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sordid activities of a small segment -- the underworld racketeers -- have too often shifted public attention away from the real achievements of the great body of Italian-Americans . Studies have shown that our citizens of Italian origin do not have a peculiar propensity for racketeering , mayhem and murder . Arrests and convictions of Italians are no more frequent , per hundred thousand in the same age and sex brackets , than for any other immigrant group , and they are slightly less than for our citizens of native stock .  | If our country has had its Capones and Lucianos , it has also had Mayor La Guardia of New York and Mayor Rossi of San Francisco . John Pastore , Governor of Rhode Island , went on to become the first U. S. Senator of Italian descent . Currently ItalianAmericans head the city governments in Cleveland , Baltimore , Meriden , Fitchburg , Mount Vernon and at least two score smaller cities . Far from being swept into office on a bloc of Italian-American votes , these men won primarily on their platforms and their records . Twice in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a major trial . The first test began with the coming to power of Mussolini and his blackshirts . Il Duce spent large sums cultivating Americans of Italian descent , and after our entry into World War II , 600,000 Italian immigrants who had not yet completed their naturalization were required to register as enemy aliens . Only about 200 , however , had to be interned . The rest were so obviously loyal that , by Columbus Day of 1942 ? only ten months after Pearl I-Harbor -- the Government relieved them of their enemy-alien status . More than 550,000 Italian-Americans served in our Armed Forces and played an invaluable role in the Italian campaign ? by convincing the Italian people that America came not to conquer but to liberate . The second great test came when postwar Italy was in the throes of the election struggle of 1948 . The Communists , well-heeled and well organ- ized , seemed on the verge of coming to power . Many Italian-Americans had relatives and friends in Italy who had gone violently over to the Red side . Spontaneously , from a poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans with Italian names wrote to their relatives in Italy . By March 1948 thousands of missives , expressing the hope that Italy would retain its new-won democracy , were on their way ; and by April the New York post office was handling a million letters a week . Whether the Communists would have won , instead of losing as they did , had the letters not been sent , no one can say . But never again need anyone doubt that the Italian immigrants and their offspring have become fully American in the best sense of that word . Today , a great and growing part in bringing American literature , art , movies , styles and techniques to Italy is being played by ItalianAmericans , thousands of whom ? like Louis Salzarulo ? have revisited the towns of their birth or the places where their fathers or grandfathers came from . And , in return , all America is today receiving and gladly accepting the product of Italy 's new renaissance , from Necchi sewing machines to the movies of Mangano and Lollobrigida .
