For G.l.s who like jive and pin-up girls in about equal proportions , the Armed Forces Radio Service hit upon a neat solution : wrap up both and deliver them in a single package . The package is a pretty ex-movie starlet named Rebel Randall , the disc jockey of Jukebox , U.S.A. , whose face and statistics ( 36 in. bust and hips , 24-in. waist ) are every bit as appealing as her throaty voice . <P> By last week , brunette , green-eyed Rebel Randall ( who was born Alaine Brandes 29 years ago in Chicago ) was a top radio and pin-up attraction on such far-flung military networks as the Mosquito ( Guadalcanal ) , the Far Eastern ( Japan and Korea ) , the Jungle ( New Guinea ) and the Bedside ( military hospitals ) . Her five-day-a-week show is beamed to more than two million members of the armed forces and some 80 million foreign listeners-in . She gets 1,000 letters a month from G.l.s , asking for pinups , making requests for favorite records and offering her everything from marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Japan called her in Los Angeles to say he was sending an oil painting for her bedroom . Another soldier wrote that she reminded him of " a marshmallow in a cup of hot chocolate . " <P> Rebel knows enough music to play the piano and sing passably , but she has had to learn or invent a whole new vocabulary while spinning records for hep soldiers . Now a saxophone is always a " goldenrod , " playing a trumpet is " scraping the ceiling , " drums are " kettles " and violins are " angel music . " When not talking about hot &; sweet records , Rebel tries to strike a fine balance between sentiment and bathos , because " our purpose is n't to make them lonesome , it 's to make them happy . " <P> Though she still makes an occasional movie ( her most recent is a quickie called Danger Zone ) , Rebel hopes that the Armed Forces Radio will let her keep her disc jockey show on the air as long as there are U.S. troops overseas . Adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service : " I guess that will be a long time . "
