Without fuss or strain , Adlai Stevenson last week proved that he is in charge of the national Democratic Party . His followers had little trouble , at the Democratic National Committee meeting in New Orleans , in putting over their candidate to succeed Stevenson 's friend , Steve Mitchell , as national chairman . <P> They thus bested the Northern city bosses : Tammany Hall 's Carmine DeSapio , Chicago 's Jake Arvey and Pittsburgh 's Dave Lawrence . The bosses ' candidate , Philadelphia City Councilman James A. Finnegan , was absent , recuperating from gall-bladder surgery . Lawrence explained with the sincerest form of flattery : " Why , he just had the same operation that Adlai Stevenson had . " Later , at a meeting of committeemen from the Western states , Lawrence tried again . Said he : " I wo n't ask you to raise your hands , but I just wonder how many men in this room have n't had gallstones . " <P> Harry Truman 's candidate was fat , witty Michael DiSalle , former mayor of Toledo and Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting , and it was apparent that his influence was weak and that neither DiSalle nor Finnegan had close to the 53 votes needed to win . <P> The third candidate was Indiana Committeeman Paul M. ( for Mulholland ) Butler , a 49-year-old South Bend attorney , a faithful Stevenson backer , and a long-time enemy of Truman 's friend , former National Committee Chairman Frank McKinney . Like DiSalle , Finnegan , and all Democratic chairmen since 1928 , Butler is a Roman Catholic . <P> Sam Rayburn arrived late at the meeting , found Butler in the lead , and urged that the election be postponed for two months . DeSapio , Arvey , Lawrence &; Co. applauded this suggestion . But the committeemen , feeling their oats , resented it and pressed for a vote . <P> On the first ballot Butler won easily , rolling up 70 votes . DiSalle got 18 votes , Finnegan 16 . <P> At the $100-a-plate dinner after Butler was chosen , Adlai Stevenson told the Democrats he planned to devote more time to earning a living* and less to politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to work hard to stay in front of rival Democrats . His man Butler had won despite the fact that Butler was almost unknown to some leading Democrats . At the dinner Georgia 's Congresswoman-elect Iris Blitch rose to praise the new chairman and said : " Mr. Paul-what is your name ?
