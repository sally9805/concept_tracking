NOT BY BREAD ALONE ( 512 pp. ) - Vladimir Dudintsev-Dutton ( $4.95 ) . <P> <P> No less a literary critic than Nikita S. Khrushchev has called this book " wrong at the root " and misrepresenting life " as through a crooked mirror . " Before the Russian censors caught on to this view , the Moscow magazine Novy Mir published the novel in three installments last year . At the time , the world jumped with astonishment : a Russian novelist had not only written critically of the Soviet regime , but had done so bluntly , sarcastically , rudely . With Poland and Hungary threatening to tip the boat , Not by Bread Alone had a special menace because 1 ) it roused wild excitement among both intellectuals and ordinary citizens in Russia , 2 ) its blows against the order established by Stalin went a lot farther and deeper than even Khrushchev desired . <P> Soon the machine went into action , and both the Communist Party and Writers ' Union denounced Author Dudintsev as a talented , well-meaning fellow who had fallen victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a preface to this translation Dudintsev dutifully supplies a mitigating explanation of what his novel is all about . But no explanation is necessary . The book is a major , fascinating document of life in Soviet Russia . <P> The Forgotten Man . It is a plain tale with an ancient theme . A young schoolmaster , Dmitri Lopatkin. invents a machine for making drainpipes . He sends the drawing of his new centrifugal pipe-casting machine to the responsible bureau , receives friendly encouragement and has his project submitted to " expert " opinion . Promptly things start going wrong . Lopatkin , who has given up schoolteaching and is now wholly dedicated to the cause of drainpipery , falls victim to a mysterious bureaucratic runaround . Months and years pass in a silence punctuated only by official notifications : " It is not considered possible . . . " " Your complaint has been forwarded to . . . " Occasionally Comrade Lopatkin is summoned for discussion , is shunted from one official to another . Repeatedly he comes close to success only to be tossed into the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , ignoring hints and muttered warnings , until one day he finds himself sentenced to eight years in a labor camp . " It was as though he had been thrown overboard into the sea at night , while the brightly lighted ship . . . sailed on , leaving him behind . ' ' <P> From the start of his novel Author Dudintsev describes , side by side with Lopatkin 's progress , what is happening behind the scenes in ministries , bureaus and industrial institutes . All the timeservers and Organization Men in high places are aware of one thing-that a big shot in Moscow has a pet scheme of his own regarding drainpipes , and that no Soviet citizen should ever , if he values his security , " get in the way of influential people . " As Bureaucrat Drozdov , the novel 's villain , tells Lopatkin : " Your mistake consists in being an individual on his own . The lone wolf is out of date . " To his wife Nadia . Drozdov is even franker . " Whenever Lopatkin came to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head like this " - and Drozdov throws his head up in a proud , arrogant gesture .
