Letters to The Times Work of Byrd Committee Forming a European Union Senator Byrd Explains Scope of Its Activities in Reply to Criticism To THE EDITOR OP THE New YORK TIMES : The record of the Joint Committee of Nonessential Federal Expenditures , accurately stated , needs no defense . But the Junior Senator from Minnesota , Hubert Horatio Humphrey , persists in broadcasting misstatements about the committee and its work . He did it in the Senate , but his statements were completely refuted in the Congressional Record of March 2 . Yet a letter to you , published March 21. was an abridged version of . his Senate speech . He introduced a bill to abolish the committee ; but Congress would not want to act on misstatements any more than you would want to mislead readers by innuendo . The Humphrey letter said there were " two main arguments in support " of his proposal to abolish the committee : ( 1 ) The " committee violates the spirit and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ( 2 ) the " committee has ceased to funcCion since 1946 . " Arguments Answered As to " main argument " ( 1 ) , Congress deliberately excluded the status of joint committees from application of the Reorganization Act . This particular committee was established by law five years before 1946 ; it was subject to review when the 1946 act was considered ; and it has been reviewed by Congress since then . There are other joint committees , and those who think they violate the Reorganization Act are in disagreement withethe views of Congress recorded to date . As to " main argument " ( 2 ) , the committee , along with routine worlet currently is engaged on numerous formally approved projects , and more have been formally directed for the coming fiscal year . Previously there have been thirty-five formal committee hearings , twenty-five reports containing some seventy-five economy and efficiency recommendations , and personnel statistics have been compiled monthly since 1943 . In more than fifty instances legislative or administrative action has been taken in fields pointed out by committee recommendations . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know that federal statistical agencies use the committee compilations , or that the committee started compiling personnel data when it found figures from other sources were unreliable . For instance , Civil Service reports showed a January reduction of 23,000 in Post Office employment . Actually , there was a 675 increase . The committee has found excessive employment usually indicates inefficiency and waste . The Humphrey letter suggested that the Senate Committee on Expenditures in Executive Departments was " established " by the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 and that since then the Joint Committee has been intruding on this legislative committee 's prerogatives . The chairman and the majority of the members of the legislative committee have . indicated that they do not share the Humphrey views . Actually , Legislative Committees on Expenditures in Executive Departments were created in both the House and the Senate long before 1946 . Between 1933 and 1946 chairmen of the Senate committee included Senators Lister Hill of Alabama and J. Ham Lewis of Illinois , and chairmen of the House committee included John J. Cochran of Missouri , James A. O'Leary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Committee Jurisdiction of these respective committees was expanded some by the Legislative Reorganization Act , but their general purposes are now about the same as they were in 1941 when the Joint Committee on Reduction of Nonessential Federal Expenditures was established . There is a marked . distinction between Congressional joint investigating committees and the standing legislative committees in the respective houses of Congress . The nature of this Joint Committee , which was originated at the suggestion of former Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau , is especially distinctive because its membership embraces in one body not only members of the Tax and Appropriations committees of both houses but also the heads of the executive fiscal agencies . The work of virtually all committees of Congress affects expenditures in executive departments but Senator Humphrey finds that only this joint investigating committee overlaps the legislative Committees on Expenditures in Executive Departments , Even if the allegation were valid , I would not quarrel with any committee of Congress which urges economy and efficiency . In his letter to you , Senator Humphrey mentioned that Congress has continued to " appropriate funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exaggeration that the committee was the " number one example of waste and extravagance . " In eight and one-half years the committee 's expenditures have averaged $14,000 a year . During Senator Humphrey 's first year in the Senate his speeches and insertions covered about 250 Congressional Record pages . At more than $80 a page , the printing cost was approximately $21,000 , or 50 per cent more than the committee 's average annual expenditures . He was chairman of no committee and therefore was speaking for himself . Joint committee reports are factual and advisory . If Senator Humphrey calls them propaganda , how would he describe his 400,000-word initial contribution to the Congressional Record ? HARRY F. BYRD . Chairman , Joint Committee on Reduction of Nonessential Federal Expenditures . Washington , April 7 , 1950 . Technique Considered to Lie in the Division of All Participants To THE EDITOR OP THE Nsw YORK TIMES : The principle of working with instead of against Germany in a new Europe was advanced , as your editorial of April 6 points out , as early as September , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our statesmen are still talking about the principle , asserting it every day with greater unanimity . It seems that at last the question of method should be tackled . How can Germany be brought into a union with Western Europe ? Here , our peace planners are at a loss because of their contradictory awareness that Germany is both a necessary as well as an impossible member of a future union . Necessary , because she is too big to be left out , and impossible because she is too big to be drawn in . Thus , in whatever direction the Allies move , the result will be nothing but a new problem . In their search for a way out of this dilemma our statesmen frequently study the Congress of Vienna , where a similar condition seems to have existed . However , the aims were then quite different . No European union was then contemplated . To find truly similar situations our statesmen must go back to the creation of a unified France or Great Britain out of dissimilar , hostile and conquered nations . Prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as thoroughly as the Germans hate the French , and vice versa . Like Germans and French , they fought each other in a succession of furious wars . As in the case of Germany and France , one of the partners of the planned union was disproportionately powerful and , it was feared , would dominate the union . ' Yet the union was effected with relative ease , and has proved most successful ever since . Why ? Because England and Scotland were never united in the first place . As political entities of unequal size they were destroyed . They were cut into innumerable and equally small counties which alone were the political entities of the new union . The elements which were thus united were the small insignificant counties , not the large nations . This kind of union succeeded because , while the nations were laden with irreconcilable historic hatreds , the counties had no quarrel with each other . Exactly the same procedure was applied by France . Half a dozen historically hostile nations were obliterated and replaced by over ninety departments whose mutual relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united . England and France have thus given us superb examples of the technique that must be applied if previously hostile nations are to be absorbed in a new structure . This technique is the division of all participants .. Applied to the present European problem this means that , as nations , neither France nor Germany can be successfully brought into a European union . Their historic hostility would render such a union unbearable even if technically it could be brought about . But Bavaria , Hesse , Alsace , Saar , Burgundy , Picardy , Navarre , Normandy can be united . While Germans and French will always be suspicious of each other , no Bavarian ever hated a Basque , and no Burgunder ever hated a Brunswicker . The secret of union , indeed of all government and organization , has always been in the art of division . LEOPOLD KOHR . Assistant Professor of Economics , Rutgers University . New Brunswick , N. J. , April 6 , 1950 . Memorial Fence Queried TO THE EDITOR or , THE NEW YORK TIMES : A fence around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women who gave their lives in World War II , seems a poor idea for a " memorial . " Fences and walls , whether they be real or in the mind , may seem to protect property or ideas , but they also keep out . people and ideas that are needed if our moral education is to be accelerated and not stunted by holding and excluding simultaneously . Some of us whose sons were killed in the war are trying to augment the belief that they died for people and ideas that are growing toward " beauty , truth and goodness . " Must we build fences to preserve such beliefs ? Let us rather help to improve the moral standards of all sorts and conditions of men . Can we not persuade the memorial planners to turn to building an educational or wholesome recreational building that will include , not exolude , any human being and thus extend , not bar , the influence for zood of the U. N. ? MARGARET S. SPEERS . New York ; April 2. 1950 . Late Corners at " Parsifal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I attended the Good Friday performance of " Parsifal " and , along with the great majority of the audience , was annoyed by the many late corners . A horde tramped down the aisles attended by the flashlights of the ushers all during the first half of the opening scene , and a few even interrupted the matchless second scene . " Parader is more than a beautiful opera , it is a religious experience , especially the Good Friday performance , and the reverent attitude of the audience attests this . Why should the late comers not be compelled to wait until the break between scenes ? At the Philharmonic the doors are closed as the conductor mounts the podium and not opened till the end of the first number . I wish the practice could be extended to all opera and theatre performances , but at the Good Friday " Parsifal " it should be obligatory . PHEBE L. GILL . Englewood . N.
