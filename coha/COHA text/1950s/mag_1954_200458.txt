Marine on Trial <P> Sir : <P> My sympathies go out to Colonel Frank Schwable , who . . . was tortured by the Communists and . . . put on trial in this country for falsely confessing that the U.S. had used germ warfare on the Chinese Communists TIME , March 22 ... As for the value of such a confession to the enemy , I have seen no proof that it cost us any lives , or friends . . . After all , we were the first and , so far , the only nation to drop atom bombs on civilians , so we should n't be too squeamish about being charged with germ warfare . . . <P> <P> GLENN WHEELER East Orange , NJ . <P> <P> Sir : <P> . . . General William F. Dean said that he would never go to war again without a suicide pill as insurance against captivity . . . I shudder to think of the situation that would exist within the armed forces ... if it became commonly acceptable for all military men to gulp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying around with them in their watch pocket for use when in danger . . . <P> JOHN P. LEONARD JR . Lieut . Colonel , U.S.M.C. Quantico , Va . <P> Sir : <P> I served under Colonel Schwable in World War II , and if the occasion should arise , I , for one , would be proud to serve under him again . What is expected of the American fighting man of today ? Is he expected to follow General Dean 's suggestion and carry some deadly poison to take if capture seems imminent ? Are the quartermasters to issue cyanide pills along with other combat gear ? Are we , a Christian nation , now to become devoted to harakiri ? Ridiculous ! But that is the only logical sequence if Colonel Schwa-ble is not completely exonerated and restored to a full-duty status . . . <P> NATHAN BEDELL Major , U.S.M.C.R. ( Inactive ) Jacksonville , Fla . <P> Sir : <P> The armed services could learn a lesson from Colonel Schwable 's experience . Wars from here on in will be fought over ideological issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of torture ... My son is in the service , and I have told him : if ever captured , confess if you must . Do n't give away positions or troop movements , but subjects such as germ warfare and the like are absurd . The facts will be brought to light later regardless of what they make you say about it . You have a gun at your head ... Be practical , and stay alive . . . <P> <P> LIONEL ORMSBY Los Angeles <P> Underwater Photographer <P> Sir : <P> The sport of spearfishing is really just coming into its own , and its future is almost unlimited . Congratulations on your timely and excellent pictorial feature on it TIME , March 22 . <P> Your readers might enjoy a picture I took of the photographer , George Leavens , in action under water see cut . He is using a special case that he constructed himself and that houses both his camera and light meter . <P> <P> STANTON A. WATERMAN Sargentville , Me . <P> <P> Refreshing <P> Sir : <P> How refreshing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 29 , after a double dose of McCarthy and his brash young rogues , Cohn and Schine ! . . . <P> <P> ( THE REV . ) GEORGE W. GOODLEY Wilmington , Del . <P> <P> Dum Du Dum Dum <P> Sir :
