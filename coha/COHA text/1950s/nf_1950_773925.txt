txt It was regular visiting hour . Each of the twelve visiting stalls was occupied . There was a clamor of Italian , Spanish , Yiddish and English . Everyone felt he had to shout to be heard above the din . " Madeline , " I said through the telephone , " let me see you , step back from the glass . " She smiled quizzically , stood so . I could see her . I motioned , she came up to the glass . We grinned , we were happy , happier than we 'd ever been . Every now and then we became aware of the din around us . We could hardly hear each other . " Tell me again what it 's like . " I told her something of the prison , of my work in the officers ' mess , how I resented being forced to do work I did n't want to . Shortly we were discussing the possibility of my getting out of jail . " Is n't there something you can work so you can get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . " There must be some way . " If there is , I do n't know of it . " Then she asked very seriously : " Why do n't you go into the army , Lowell ? . . . We could see each other then ... . They wo n't declare war . You know what Roosevelt said . Just go in , you wo n't have to kill anybody ? just go in . " Her face , her eyes , looked up at me through the small pane of glass . " You can beat it other ways . Why not just join the army ? Why sit in jail ? " " Madeline ! Madeline ! " I broke in excitedly . " Do you know what you 're doing ? Do you realize ? why ? whyyou 're actually trying to get me to go against myself ! .. . Why ? you 're trying to get inc to support the draft and the idea of war . You 're supposed to be working for me , not against me ! " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 30 small square glass . I hardly knew what to do . I felt like leaving . Madeline had changed ? her ideas , everything it appeared , had changed . I jerkily , hesitatingly pushed out the next words : " Just forget about everything ? forget everything . I think it would be better if you did n't come to see me any more . " I waited a bit , then slowly repeated : " I think it would be best if you did n't come again . " I hesitated a bit , then waved goodbye to her through the glass , hurried from the visiting stall . The next day , on off-work hours , as I lay on my bunk thinking of Madeline and the day before , I heard a soft " Hey you . " I turned around . Outside the bars of the cell block stood a guard . " You 're Naeve , are n't you ? Lowell Naeve ? " The guard looked down the corridor . " If I were to give you a letter you were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you read it ? " " If you think that 's best , I will . " " Well , it 's from Madeline Marks . I read it first to be sure I could pass it on . I think you 'll want to read it . " He looked cautiously up and down the corridor , passed me an envelope . The letter read beautifully . Madeline told me how miserable she felt about letting me down . She ended by saying she would wait for me if I asked her to , even if I got five years . On June 16 my name again appeared.on the Court List . We were taken in the same van , sat in the same bull pen , were taken to the same court room . As I was led into the court room , I looked up , puzzled ? another new judge ! The court clerk read off the indictment . Assistant U. S. 31 Attorney Mr. Friedman explained the case to the judge . The judge asked me several routine questions . To avert my previous outbursts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? they sounded hollow and mechanical . The judge spoke of his son in the navy , and how proud he was of him . When he finished with this , he sentenced me to imprisonment for a year and a day . I was just about to say something ? but my mechanical , stumbling answers to the judge had been worse than nothing . I stopped myself short of more words .. The two marshals were at my side , escorted me out . Outside the court room waited the jaws of an elevator . I could hardly gather my feelings . We walked into the elevator , the jaws closed , the elevator went slowly , slowly down . It seemed we were descending into a deep welldown , down , down . The elevator stopped . The jaws opened . Hardly thinking , I followed the marshals out , went as directed into a bull pen ... I could only feel a sickening disgust with myself . I had clone far worse than I had thought possible . At the very moment when I should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low . A little later a marshal came to the bull pen , asked : " You know a Miss Madeline Marks ? " " Yes ? I know her . " " Well , she told me to tell you that she was there . " " Is that all she said ? " " That 's all she said . " I sat , head in hand , hardly able to think . I kept seeing the court room . 1 kept visualizing Madeline sitting out front , hoping her letter had given me a boost , hoping and pulling for me . I saw her , looking on , wondering what had happened when I spoke so disappointingly . I kept seeing 32 her standing in front of the marshal , saying : " Tell him I was there . " I had no ill-feeling toward Madeline for her brevity . I could not have any . I had fallen miserably short , and knew it . 6 . June , 1941 . D 1NBURY is supposed to be for short-timers , some of the men at West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ya got killers , pimps and everything else . It 's only sixty miles north of New York . It 's a new place , it 's supposed to be a pretty good can . " The government car rolled steadily forward . Two pistol-hipped marshals sat in front . We three prisoners sat in the rear , handcuffed together . The prisoner next to me wanted to smoke . I was glad to oblige him by moving my hand up and down with his . Trees were exceptionally green . The hills in the distance were a vibrant deep blue . The white strip of highway .... What would Danbury be like ? Three miles beyond the city of Danbury , Connecticut , high on a hill overlooking the countryside , the government Chevrolet came to a stop . The reardoors were opened . We stepped out . One of the marshals pointed to a shack where we could see a guard holding a machine gun . " It 's hard to believe , " 33 he said confidingly , " but that guy up there is an acs lnll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prison was shiny , streamlined , newlooking , a light cream in color . There was nothing to suggest bars , cells or cages . Danbury did not look like a prison . We were being led toward a small green door . I felt a rising excitement , my curiosity reached a nervous peak . A Danbury guard opened the door , we were ushered in . The green door was locked , our handcuffs were removed . The guard , as if on a time-schedule : " Take off your clothes . Lay then ' on the counter . " The three of us reluctantly took off our clothes . " Want them sent home or burned ? " I stared at my trousers , shirt , shoes . Sent home or burned ? The words stood up before me like a flash on a movie screen . I could n't imagine myself getting out of prison . My release date , June 16 , 1942 , felt like it was many years away . " Sent home or burned ? " stopped my mind , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'd just as well burn them . " An impatient doctor arrived , put blue ointment under our arms and legs , to kill the crabs . We were handed bluegrey coveralls , brown shoes , white socks ; a toothbrush , a small tinny metal comb . The coveralls were baggy and ragged , hung limply on us . The three of us looked at each other dejectedly , said nothing . The guard standing in a doorway motioned with his hand , " In here . " Disinterestedly we moved ahead . The curiosity , excitement we had experienced before the green door had given place to despondency . In the adjoining record office we were finger-printed , our numbers given us , our pictures very carefully taken by a Mr. Kunkel . While we waited somewhat impatiently for each pro-34 cess , I followed with my eyes the sunspots on the cement floor . The sun shone into the cold sterile room from an outside window . It was hard to believe that the sun could and did shine into the prison . The sunspots busied themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times there was a brilliant gay gem-like glitter , the spots glittered . the spots sparkled and danced . Shortly , like dogs on a leash , we were following a guard down a very narrow corridor toward a large green door marked " Quarantine . " The door was unlocked , we were led in . Quarantine cell block was a big hollow place with two tiers of cells on each side . Some fifty prisoners were moving about on the ground floor . They wore baggy ragged blue-grey coveralls like our own . I recognized some of the men as prisoners I had seen at West Street . We were turned over to the quarantine officer . " Here 's what 's expected of you during your stay . You are always to address an officer as sir ' ? answer Yes , sir ' . " ( It soon proved that when he spoke to me he just growled out " Hey you over there " ; if I hesitated to respond : " Naeve , hey Naeve 786 . " ) " You are always to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys will show you how it is done . " " You get up at six o'clock , lights out at ten . You are given the privilege of writing two letters a week . In your letters you are not permitted to say anything about the prison . " We had to fill out papers , cards , report to the guard in charge several times . It was evening before I got a chance to talk to some of the men . They were quick to relate : " They 've got about a dozen guys that believe like you out in die regular part of the prison . " At 9:30 when we were told " It 's lockup for the count " wc : went to our assigned cells , the guard to " the lock box . " C1'e caauld hear him adjusting the levers that closed the 35 doors . He yelled : " Keep your fingers out of the doors . Keep your heads in . " The solid steel doors , one row at a time , slammed shut in unison ? CRASHED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It emphasized the hollow space between the opposite tiers of cells . I glanced out of my small cell-door window . I felt oddly separated from the man across the way . The crash of the doors made me , as it probably did most men , go to the window at the other end of the cell , peer out . The crash of the doors , peering out , made me feel that Danbury , where I now was , was a very very strange place . A man 's first night where he is to do his first time ? a night full of many reflections mountain stream a small wooden bridge I saw the water swirl about Madeline 's ankles as she waded only a month ago we had gone on a picnic in Van Cortlandt Park mountain stream I saw the swirling Missouri River , widely scattered white houses , brick buildings SIOUX CITY the folks at home New York Foley Square the court house the judge who sentenced me I thought : the right of one human to imprison another what a strange assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts stuck in my mind . . . . I inhaled , the smell of fresh concrete seemed to penetrate ? saturate me . I wondered what the rest of the prison was like . I 37 wondered if the men in the other cells were looking out like myself . I undressed , went to bed . I thought of many things , kept turning over in my mind the impressions of the outside . I lay and lay , so it seemed , just thinking and thinking . It was a long while before I could go to sleep . July , 1941 THE days in quarantine ? the first , the second , the rest ? went very much the same ... . The first thing we heard in the morning was a bugle sharply calling out reveille . ( I envisioned a row of army tents , a row of soldiers , disgruntedly standing at attention . ) Next there were sounds of keys ? a key opening the quar-antine door . There were sounds of a guard shuffling about inside the cell block , laying his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coat . We stayed in our bunks , waited . We heard more jangling of keys , then a key turning the lock of a lever box . The door squeaked as it opened . I imagined the guard peering into the box to see that all the dials and levers were " just right . " He took ahold of a lever ; the long steel arms above our doors scraped , fell into place . The moment was near ... . ? A shrilling piercing whistle . It entered every cell , filled the void between the opposite tiers . The echoes of the shrill died out , leaving the cell block cold and hollow . A curt command : EVERYBODY UP ! Our cell doors slid open simultaneously . Like everyone else I looked through my open door at the tiers of cells across the way . Every-one was getting up . We did n't want to get up , but we did . Why ? We did n't know . . . . We just got up . Behind me and behind every man hung one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were 39 told , what would they do to us ? There was the " hole ; " various stories and descriptions of it were going the rounds . If the authorities put us in the hole , in solitary , for a couple of months , would we be able to take it ? There was this big question mark . So ? everyone got up , everyone did as he was told . When the guard said , " O.K. , boys , let 's mop up , " we mopped up . If the guard said , " Let 's clean the brass , " we cleaned the brass ; it made no difference if the brass was clean and we felt it could be made no cleaner . If the guard said " O.K. , line up , " we lined up . That 's all there was to it . Dictatorially prisons are run ; by threat the men are ruled . The only thing that kept each individual , including myself , from feeling completely stupid and ridiculous was that he saw everyone doing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went to eat we were made to line up to get our food , told where and how to sit down . After breakfast , which was very poor , we were sent out to work on the yard gang . The yard was the square that the surrounding dullyellow buildings enclosed . The prison had no walls as such ? the smooth-faced buildings were themselves the walls ; they looked high and unclimbable . Danbury was only a few months old . The yard was a good deal the way the construction company had left it , barren and bleak ; uneven broken mounds of yellow clay . The yard gang was already at work . The yard-boss , a tall sturdy guard , dryly motioned us over to a pile of wellworn picks and shovels . We were lined up , told what to do . Very shortly the other prisoners informed me that picking was , for the most part , " just to keep us busy . " As I went through the motions of working , following 40 the mind and wishes of the guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use my time constructively . I disliked being pushed around but I decided to say nothing for awhile ? maybe something would happen . At times it felt as though my growing disgust was going to rise out of my stomach and speak of itself . We picked till noon . We were taken to eat . We picked all afternoon till 4:30 , then we were , with the rest of the prison , locked up and counted . Shortly after the count we were given food again . The rest of the evening and the night we were kept in quarantine . Each day the prison 's dictatorial regimentation was grinding into me more and more . We were n't supposed to think , just supposed to do and obey . Each command was a threat ? we did as told , or else ! After breakfast on the fifth day I was given a new assignment . They did n't ask me , just told me ? " Go with the guard there . " It was assumed I would go . 41 I went , said nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing I could hardly suppress . With some other prisoners I followed the guard across the yard . I was completely dis gusted with myself for obeying . I knew as 1 followed the guard that sooner or later I would have to balk at being dictated to . I looked ahead at the walk . Twenty feet forward was a spot . I looked at the spot , and I knew l was going to stop . I grew warm all over . I felt a gathering ol my loose emo tions . I reached the spot , stopped . The guard and the other prisoners reached the green door they were headed for . The guard turned , counted his men . He noticed inc standing iii the walk about forty feet back . " Hey , you ! " lie yelled , " Come on ! " I said nothing . " Hey ! " he yelled , " What 's the matter ? " He waited a bit , then walked towards inc . " What 's the matter ? " " I ca n't go any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wo n't go any f:u tlicr . " He broke in : " You mean you refuse to work ? " " You can call it whatever you want , I do n't care ... . It 's just ... I want to have some say how my own life is to be run . I 'm tired ol being dictated to . " He acted as though he did n't hear me . " Are you com ing along ? " " No . " " Well , we 'll see about that . " He took me over to a cell house in the corner of the yard . I wondered what was going to happen , but I did n't particularly care . With another guard , he marched me up past three tiers of barred cells , locked me in a top cell . The burning growl inside of me was gone . I had op- 42 posed what I thought wrong . For the first time in a month I felt sure and collected . In a few minutes a young prisoner came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bars , and in a very friendly voice said : " You 're Naeve , the new war objector ? " I said yes . He enthusiastically extended his hand through the bars : " I 'm one , too ; Schoenfeldt 's the name . " In a soft voice he asked me what had happened . We talked awhile . He left , saying : " I 'll be back . It there 's anything you need , tell me . I 'll get it for you . " An hour passed . Then a guard marched me over to the prison hospital , locked me up in an observation cell . There was nothing in the cell but a bed , nothing to read or occupy my time . ... The thought came vividly to mind : They were trying to frighten me with being put in the hole or being shipped to Springfield , Missouri . " Springfield " was , I heard , the federal prison-hospital where prisoners were often intimidated and roughed up . If you are sent there , it implies you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cell ? How long could I stand it ? I walked up and down . From time to time I noticed faces peering in through the cell-door 's small shatterproof window . The large window opposite the cell door had no vent . The July sun shone in . By 10:30 the cell was stifling hot . At twelve o'clock the cell door was opened and a tray of food set in . Then from time to time in the afternoon there would be a knock at my cell door . A prisoner would motion in the little glass window , then talk to me through the crack between the door and the door-jamb . They all said pretty much the same . " Take it easy kid . You 're right to buck ' em , but you ca n't beat the system . " Then in a friendly 43 way : " Why do n't you give it up ? Why do n't you do like everybody else ? You 're doing it the hard way . " I contrasted their feelings with mine . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing what they did n't want to do . 1 felt comparatively free . Two days passed , I took to walking back and forth , to facilitate my thinking . Doing nothing but thinking was , I discovered , amazingly enjoyable . 1 thought a good deal of Madeline , those I knew hack home . 1 thought a good deal about equality ? that I , as a human being , had a right , an inalienable right , to equality . No man was above me , no man was below me. 1 thought about the right to run my own life . I had occasionally thought of these things when free . Now I thought of them a good deal . The third day nothing happened . On the fourth day at 7 p. m . I heard a key in my door . Surprised , I looked up . A short pear-shaped man in carefree tennis slacks walked briskly into the cell . He smiled , made motions he wanted to shake my hand . We shook hands . " Hello , Naeve , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How are you getting along ? " He moved over to the low cell-window , sat on the windowledge , adjusted his dark-rimmed glasses . In a serious tone : " What 's the matter , Naeve , what 's the matter ? " " I think I ought to have some say about how my own life is to be run . . . . I want to do some physical work three or four hours a day to keep in good shape . But the rest of the time I want to study and paint .... I 'd just like to be left alone to paint my own things . " He looked out of the window awhile . " I think that can be arranged . We can probably set aside a fund of fifty dollars or so for art materials . " 44 I did n't want to feel obligated to Mr. Gerlach . I told him that I preferred to have paints sent in from the outside , pay for them myself . He agreed . " Would you be willing to go back to quarantine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said I would . " Is there anything else you want ? " " I 'd like to get out of jail . " He laughed , the conversation shifted . After twenty minutes of casual talk , he left . He seemed pleased with the visit and the bargain he 'd made . The next clay , back in quarantine , I began thinking about the warden 's $50 proposal . It puzzled me . Most of the men in quarantine did n't even have socks to wear . The warden 's cry was , the institution did n't have funds . In the remaining three weeks of quarantine I came to know many of the prisoners . Two were new war objectors , One of whom , Gene Garst , was a tall sharp-featured merchant seaman from Philadelphia . Gene , in a long speech in court , had advocated everyone leaving the army , to curb the trend toward war . For this he was given the limit ? five years . The other objector , " Scotty , " was a very cheerful insurance salesman , married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . A month passed . For some of us , the quarantine period was over . We were given regular prison clothes ? white undershirt and shorts , white socks , one pair of light-blue trousers , an army belt , one light-blue shirt . " You 'll get a change of clothes once a week . " At the same time my paints arrived . The warden , enthusiastically : " I 've arranged it so you can use one of the dressing rooms in the auditorium as a studio . ' It 'll be a good place to paint . " 45 8 . July-August , 1941 I WAS moved to close-custody ( 75 cells ) , the largest cell house in the prison . I was put on the second-tier . On the top tier , above Inc , in a screened-off section , was " the bing " ? " the hole . " The " bing " cells had no windows . At their entrances were regular barred gates plus solid steel doors . When the doors were closed , the cells were dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the men who were most likely to try to escape . It became clearly visible that the prison had distinct divisions . One cell block housed a crew of German sailors who with their captain had scuttled their ship at the outbreak of the war in ' 39 . Another housed a crew of Italians who with their captain had done the same . Negroes were kept in a Jim Crow cell house . One cell block was pretty well filled with bootleggers . The rest of the cell houses held letter c l-riers , car-theft cases , check-writers , border-jumpers , army sodomy cases , income-tax violators . The only other sizeable group was the war objectors , some thirteen or fourteen men who were very popular with the other prisoners . One , 1 ) on Benedict , pitched expert softball . He set several strikeout records against visiting outside teams . He was by far the best known prisoner . Eight of the war objectors were divinity students , of various denominations , who had refused to register . This group went on strike every now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only section of prisoners not afraid 46 to protest an act of the authorities . The other war objectors included one fundamentalist ; two men not attached to anything ; and two Socialist Party members . These were the first Socialists I 'd ever met . These fourteen men were the first I 'd known who held what I 'd call genuine anti-war ideas . I enjoyed talking with them . They spoke of James V. Bennett , the head of the Bureau of Prisons . Several had met him ? " a very slick and evasive politician . " They talked of Scotty , the cheerful war ob-47 jector I had met in quarantine . He had suddenly become very melancholy . He had no more than entered the prison when his wife 's new-born baby died and she became very ill . Scotty began to look worried and gaunt . He was beginning to stay pretty much to himself . Among the other prisoners , I came to go around with a fellow who had previously clone seven years in Dannemora ; a Negro prize fighter called Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ den once said : " Some of the best people you ever meet , you meet in jail . " From the bootleggers I learned how stills are set . up , from others the different angles to passing bills . I learned how to steal a car , how and where to get rid of it in Baltimore , Maryland . I was told how narcotics ( " junk " ) was run into New York City . Much to my surprise I found the prisoners just as honest as the average businessman . Prison officials were on the other hand frequently underhanded . Often they would coax a man into conformity by making out he had a chance to make parole when he did n't . They would tell outsiders that the food was good when it was abominable . They would refuse to let us write in our letters what was going on in the prison in a roundabout way forcing us to lie that everything was O.K. If a man was thrown in " the hole " or had been banged around , I wrote my parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these occasions I was called down to the front office to explain . On one such trip the censor read my letter aloud to me : " But ? how can you say such things ? ! " I told him flatly : " It 's all true and you know it . " A pained look on his face asked that I not accuse him if anything . " But we ca n't let you send anything like this out . Why do n't you take it back , write the letter over ? " 48 pleadingly ? " omit the objectionable parts , so we can send it on to your parents . " I told him I would not change the letter . They filed it away ? refused to send it out . As I ate in the mess hall each day , I came to notice , as everyone else did , that the food was very very lousy . There was flour in most everything ; the soup had few vegetables in it , was mostly flour . We had macaroni , more macaroni , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little meat we received was frequently nearly uneatable . The men talked and grumbled steadily about the food . Often on Saturday night before the movies Warden Gerlach would get up and say : " Boys , we 're having trouble with the budget , we are 49 trying to get you better food . We 'll see to it that you get better food , " etc . This went on nearly every Saturday night . One noon there was very poor liver . To show their feelings , the men spread the liver all along on the yard walk from the officers ' mess , where Mr. Gerlach ate , to the front office . The liver became dusty and dirty , lay like thick pieces of twisted tough leather . The idea was , Warden Gerlach would have to walk through the liver to get back to his office . At the evening meal extra guards were posted outside the mess hall , waiting for something to happen . Apparently Mr. Gerlach had deemed it more sensible to pay out for more guards than to pay out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of guards on watch was lessened , the walk was covered with hotdogsthe same idea : Mr. Gerlach would have to walk through them to get back to his office .. Visible discontent over the food occurred off and on . Nearly every Saturday Mr. Gerlach made his speeches , kept saying the food would get better . It never did . The warden 's plea that he was having trouble with the budget made me think about the fifty dollars he had offered me for paints . I began to see why he had done it . He wanted to use the paintings as a false front , give outsiders the impression that the way he treated me was the way he treated all the boys . He intended to exhibit my work . He was extremely enthusiastic : " We could have a regular show , have everybody up from town . " 50 9 . August-September , 1941 ONE afternoon while I was painting in " the studio , " Warden Gerlach came to visit . We began talking about an idea I had for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mankind . It ended up with Mr. Gerlach telling me that there was some decorating he would like me to do in his home . He hinted he wanted a portrait of one of his children ? and later possibly one of himself . The other prisoners had warned me this would happen . So I explained the procedure I had in mind . I told him I believed in equality . Prisoners had also asked me to do portraits . I suggested that we might put cards for the prisoners and others interested , in a hat . We could draw a card ? whosever card it was , I 'd paint their portrait first . The warden seemed taken aback a little by his request having to await its democratic turn . The warden came to " the studio " several times . Guards frequently stopped in for a chat . Their ofttimes long visits took up much of my time . After a few weeks I decided I would have to do something about the visits so I could get some work done . The warden had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't working out that way . One day after I entered the workshop I put up two easles to bar the entrance , put a sign on the easles , went to work . An hour passed . . . . I heard the voices of Mr. Gerlach 51 and several elderly women coming toward the workshop door . He had brought the women up from the city of Danbury to show them the prison ( I was part of the exhibit ) . Mr. Gerlach and the women were approaching the door . I somewhat froze . I tried to keep on working just as before . The door began to swing open . Mr. Gerlach was opening it in a very patronizing manner . He gestured toward me , not quite looking , and said : " And here we have a young man , Mr. Naev e. who is ? " IIe paused . The five elderly women were reading the sign . The sign read : " I want to work . Would you please leave me alone ? " And then down below in small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . " The latter was jokingly put in so that Mr. Gerlach and the guards would know I was n't referring just to prisoners . 52 The old women finished reading the sign . They looked up at me through the easles that barred the door , giggled , stopped short their giggles , looked at the sign again . They did n't know what to do . They turned to the warden . Mr. Gerlach looked at me . He seemed puzzled , he seemed confident , then he seemed embarrassd . Half-confidently he said , peering through the easle bars : " Would you ? would you , Mr. Naeve , like to show us some of your paintings ? " I felt a little uneasy . I hesitated to answer , thought it over , then said , slowly and seriously : " No , I do n't believe 1 'd care to . " Mr. Gerlach , not looking too perplexed , nor too confident , closed the door , escorted the women away . I felt I had said the right thing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how I treat all the boys . I began to pack up my things . I thought to myself , This is the end of the painting . But nothing happened . A day or two later Mr. Gerlach left on his vacation . While the warden was motoring the scenic west , I carne to know one of the other war objectors well . Al Hurling had been set up with a piano in the auditorium next to the workshop . Al was an exceptional pianist . He was the first half of Mr. Gerlach 's exhibit . The month Mr. Gerlach was gone , Al and I did considerable work . Al practiced and composed , I painted . But with Mr. Gerlach 's return , the prison took on its previous tension , it was back on needles and pins . Captain Thieman , a guard and myself were immediately called into Mr. Gerlach 's office . My eyes enjoyed the plush soft rug on the office floor , the comfortable upholstered chairs , the cheerful curtains at the windows . We no more than sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not care to get into a discussion with them about it . " I sent in a note of explanation to Mr. Gerlach , the rest is up to him . " Then one of the guards repeated the question . I said nothing , it was no use . It would only lead to ridicule . When the guards saw I was n't going to argue with them , they went down to the end lock-box , released the lever-lock on my gate . A chill went down my spine . I decided to concentrate all on creating one impression ? that I just wanted to be left alone . I could hear the guards and doctor coming back down the tier-walk . They would soon enter the cell . I took the most casual position I could . I sat on my bunk , legs crossed , and began looking at some reproductions of paintings I had clipped from old magazines . The cell was very small ; the guards were right on top of me when they entered . They asked me more questions . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept turning the pictures . The air appeared to be full of a guard-anger that could n't find a way to turn itself loose . They kept questioning , trying to get me into an argument . I said nothing . " O.K. , Naeve , come along , we 're taking you out of here . " I had decided to refuse to do everything . It was the only way to eventually being left alone . I remained sitting on the bed . Finally one of the guards grabbed at one of my hands . I drew it away from him . Then two grabbed at my arms , began pulling me out of the cell . At that moment I had only one thought ? RELAX . I crumpled to the floor . The guards , fearing something had happened , stopped where they were . The third guard looked at the drooped body from out-56 They came into the cell a second time , grabbed . I RELAXED . Two guards took hold of my limp legs , the other grabbed me below the shoulders from behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold sickening feeling came into my stomach . There is something disgusting about someone taking your body and against your will carrying it off . side the cage , gasped in : " What 's the matter with him ? " Doc Sturgell : " I do n't know . " Then he took a good look at me , said , seemingly surprised at the thought : " I think he 's doing what they call passive resistance . Let go of him ; let 's see . " The two guards let go , stepped back . I got up and sat on the bed , began looking at the pictures again . The guards went out of the cell , conferred . I overheard : " Guess we 'll have to carry him . " 57 I felt like four separate parts . Each leg-end and arm-end seemed very far out from me , unattached . One guard took fairly short steps , another relatively long . Each part moved in a different rhythm . When they reached the head of the stairs that led to the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry the relaxed body down . They discussed it a bit . It was getting heavier , they decided to start right away . After the difficult turning in the narrow stairway , we came to the nearby cell-house door . The guard in front put my legs down , grabbed for the door . It was locked ! The guard who held my arms from behind set me down , went forward with his key . I was free . I got up and , at a fast walk , started down the floor for the stairway and my cell . When I was halfway down the floor to the stairs , the nervous concentrated-on-the-door guards looked back ? I was gone . One spied me forty feet away , walking for the stairs , called out : " There he goes ! " I walked along , at the same speed . I heard the guards break into a run , heard them getting closer and closer . As they grabbed , I relaxed , slumped to the floor . . One of the guards , whose last name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let me handle him . ... Let me handle him . I can make him walk . " He took my right arm , put it up behind my back , be gan twisting and pulling it upward in sharp little jerks . " O.K. , now , " he said with each upward jerk , " Walk . Get up and walk . " I remained motionless . He pulled up on my arm , my weight hung on it . B000000 B0000000000 .... Loud boos descended from the tier-walks above us , B00000 . . . then came loud catcalls. 58 I looked up . It was four-thirty , the men were coming in from work . They stood at the railings of the upper tiers . " What 's the matter down there , ca n't you handle him ? What 's the matter with you four big guys ? ca n't you handle that little ole boy ? What arc you trying to do , break his arm ? " More prisoners were coming out onto the tier-walks to boo . I said to Mr. Berkosky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Go ahead . " Mr. Berkosky continued to twist and pull up . The Doctor , Mr. Sturgell , watched for a moment more , then shouted : " Do n't ! You 'd better stop , you 'll break it . " Mr. Berkosky let go of my arm . The other guards rushed forward to pick me up . The men up on the tierwalks above continued to boo and shout . The guards took me quickly out of the cell house through the now open door . They carried me down a short corridor , then up a flight of stairs . At the top of the stairs I found I was in the hospital ? again being put into an observation cell . I was placed on the floor . A guard attendant immediately entered . " Strip , we 'll give you a pair of pajamas . " As the guards began to leave I got up . They went out , there was the expected click in the door . 59 o . September-November , 19-11 . TIE next day Doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overly courteous . It appeared they were lying low , hoping I would not bring charges against them for a possible arm injury . My clothes were returned , the cell door left open . I was told not to go out of the building . I did n't feel obliged to be my own jailer , so whenever I felt like it I went into the yard to walk or play football . About the fourth day a guard discovered that I had gone to the library to read . He " rang " the front office . Abruptly I was back in the cell , the door locked . Doc Sturgell came into my cell once a day , asked : " How are you , Naeve ? " They put in food , gave me books and old magazines . I found I would have to beg to get anything else , so I did n't ask for anything . A few days passed . They did n't care , apparently , whether I had a bath or not . A week , then nine days , went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally I decided to make my own bath . I stripped , filled the cell 's small washbowl with water , splashed the water onto me with one hand , rubbed with the other , when the bowl became empty , I refilled it , repeated the process . As I was drying myself , feeling much cleaner , I heard a key in the door . A guard shouted in : " What 's all this water doing out in the corridor ? " 60 " I 've just taken a bath . If you were as dirty as I am , you 'd take a bath out of the bowl , yourself . " Later the guard returned , told me they were putting me on the schedule for a shower every two days . The days the first week , the second , went pretty much the same . I enjoyed walking up and down , thinking . I thought of Madeline . Should I write her ? Somehow it did n't make sense . If I wrote , the question of her coming up for visits would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would take up a whole day , cost considerable . I 'd only be putting her on the spot to come up once or twice a month .. maybe she would n't come . I thought constantly of the folks at home , recollected scenes of the city . But more and more I was spending my time trying to put together the why 's of the prison . Why was the food so bad ? Why were some prisoners given better treatment and quick parole ? How had the expressions the prisoners used come into being ? In the presence of guards , prisoners had to address themes " officer " or " sir . " But among themselves prisoners alwa 's used " hack . " Hack tended to belittle rather than dignify ? at the same time it seemed to describe the job . Guards seldom guarded us . The building walls made that unnecessary . " Hack " implied that our keepers were , for the most part , errand-runners for the higher officials . At this time , as I talked to the other prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had come to accept , without thinking , many of the prisoner-expressions . A guard was a hack , prison the " can , " solitary the " bing . " Release was " hitting the street , " dying in prison " making box parole . " .. I could talk to the men through the crack ? walk up and down ? think ? or make some drawings . One day bl I noticed a drop of water on the cover of a Life magazine . When I brushed the water off , a light spot appeared where the water had been . I immediately covered the entire page with water , carefully rubbed it . The ink came off ! After a week or so of experimenting , I found that Life magazine 62 paper could be washed to a very clean white ? used for drawing paper . 1 never got a chance to see Al Hurling , Schoenfeldt , or any of the other friends I made . I was anxious to talk to them , as I had heard that so-called Civilian Public Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pacifist churches and the military ( Selective Service ) . The camps were , we heard , non-paid compulsory-labor camps ; so I was opposed to them . Scotty , Hurling , Schoenfeldt had applied to go . I hardly ever saw them except when they passed in the yard below on their way to eat . I was anxious to make a last contact with them before they left the prison . I asked one of the prisoners in the hospital to get me some heavy paper . He shoved it under my cell door . With an old razor blade I cut out large letters . That night when Hurling and Schoenfeldt passed by on their way to the mess hall , I wet the letters so they 'd stick to the glass between the window bars . I pasted up H-E-L-L-O and waved . They waved enthusiastically back . I took the letters down , waited for other friends . When they passed , I put up G-R-E-E-T-I-N-G-S and waved . While in the hospital I made friends with a prisoner called Mercier . He worked at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell . When there were no guards around , he would come to my cell door , talk " through the crack . " Mercier was soft-spoken , courteous , had- a good mind . He worried , though , about his wife and kid on the outside . He had been brought directly to Danbury from a state prison . He had n't seen the outside for four or five years . I never noticed anything out of the ordinary about him 63 until one day it appeared he was walking up and down the corridor a little more than usual . The next day he did it again . A few days later I thought I observed the walking growing . He went slowly , leisurely , but he was doing more of it . A week later I thought I saw that he was not only walking more , but he was going a little faster . Mercier just walked up and down , said as little as always . But I was beginning to see he was worrying and probably not sleeping well . The guards began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercier , take it a little easier ? " Mercier usually answered : " Oh , maybe 1 just need a change of jobs . " Meanwhile I sat in my cell , watched . He was walking quite rapidly now . Every so often at regular intervals 1 would see the flick in my cell-door window as he passed . I could hear his thump , thump , thump as he went down to the end of the corridor and back again . A few more days passed , the flicks of his passing my window became more frequent . The thump , thump , thump of his heels became more determined and stepped up . The hospital doctors appeared to be paying no attention . I was literally frozen in a way . I could not feel it wise to interrupt him ? I wanted to do something but did not know what to do . Mercier was obviously walking a little faster each day . Then one day he began to talk about parole . Why had n't they given it to him ? The next days he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why do n't they give it to me ? " In a few days more he was calling out : " Why do n't they give me my parole ? " He would very naively say : " It 's downstairs . " He was nearly crying . He was pacing up and down almost fiercely now . He was shouting out , bawling out , pleading for his parole which he thought was downstairs . 64 me when I called out . They continued to the other end of the hall , put Mercier in a cell . There was a hurried click of a key in his cell door . Then quickly , steadily in heavy thump , thump , thumps the guards were coming back down the corridor . I heard a voice say : " This one here . . . it came from this one here . " Click swish ? my cell door was open . At the entrance stood the goon squad , their faces smeared with sweat ; they glared at me . I stood still in front of them . Fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked at them . One , the biggest guard in the prison , six-four and 240 pounds , stood , legs apart , clenched fists on hips , iii the middle . Another guard stood to the left , glaring . To the right of the big man stood one of the hospital guards ; his head was literally shaking ; in his mouth was a forgotten battered cigar . He trembled as he stared at me . The big man said : " It 's none of your goddamned business what goes on here ? you know that ? " There was a long silence . Then the red-faced hospital guard with the battered cigar in his mouth said slowly , with his head trembling even more : " Naeve , " he said , " you 're too goddamned smart . " He paused awhile , glared at me . " Just mind , " he went on , " just mind your own goddamned business . " They waited a bit , we just looked at each other . I looked at them . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hanging silence they closed my cell door , locked it , went away . I could not lie down on my cot , I could not sit still . I paced up and down , wondered about Mercier . That night I could hear Mercier calling out : " Leave me alone , leave me alone . I want to go home . I ai n't bothered nobody , I ai n't bothered nobody . My parole is down- 67 stairs , I know it , it 's down there , I know it . " In a crying , pleading voice he kept crying out : " I want to go home . " I thought to myself , as I lay in bed , why beat the man up ? I could see no sense to it . It would only make him worse . Two days later , the boys came to my door , told me : " They 've got him on the floor .... He 's in a straitjacket . " He 'd gone completely wild . I imagined and wondered how it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mercier lying in a straitjacket , lying on the floor . Then a few days later the boys told me : " Some marshals or somebody carne after him . lust jabbed him in the arm with a needle , knocked him out , took him out on a stretcher . " Some prisoners said he was taken to a private sanitarium , some said he was shipped to the federal prison hospital at Springfield , Missouri . Nobody really knew . On several occasions after that I heard prisoners ask : " Where did they take Mercier ? " We kept asking . We never did find out . 11 . November , 1941-February , 1942 . A FEW days after lIercier 's removal , I was moved back to close-custody , given a cell on the first floor . The authorities informed me they would leave my cell door open if I conformed they were giving me a last chance . I told them I would not obey their orders , so they again locked me up . 69 In my " new " cell , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The space beside the bunk was nearly as long as a ping-pong table , half as wide . I spent most of the afternoon walking abruptly back and forth . In the evening the other prisoners came to the front of the cell , told me : " You 'll go nuts in there . Hell , you 'll never be able to finish your seven months that way . " That first night after lights out I lay on my bunk thinking : What a strange thing to be sitting in a prison objecting to a war that had n't even started ! November , 1941 ? As many times before , I asked when would the war begin ? The first , the second day ? At meal-times a tray of food was slid under the locked cell gate . I washed the ink off Life magazine paper , looked into my small cell mirror , did self-portraits for practice . The days were well-filled , going quickly . Occasionally other prisoners stopped by , passed me the latest prison news . The divinity students ' time had expired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The menu for tomorrow I hear is .. . But one thing more than anything else began to occupy my time . The cell house was n't heated in the day-time . I had to walk up and down to keep warm . I put my jacket on , and began ? Four up , four back , four up , four back ? I was beginning to get the steps just the right length . Then I discovered that by doing one sideways on one end I could go rhythmically in a circle . Four up ? one across ? four back ? and repeat . This was the best . After two days I got so I could walk up and down nearly without looking . On the third morning a guard came down and announced that the gate would be opened each morning so I could go over to the mess hall . If I did n't go over , I would n't get breakfast . I felt they were only baiting me , try-70 ing to get me back into the regimentation . I never went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do anything for the authorities , stayed in my cell . The prisoners who had ridiculed my bucking , slowed up , took me more seriously . The breakfast baiting continued . One morning at the end of the third week a short fat officer named Fenton approached the front of my cell . " Ya know , Naeve , I could give you breakfast if you would just be a good boy . Three meals are better'n two . What do you say ? " I had been extremely agitated by the daily baiting . I hesitated to speak , growled inside , then answered : " I do n't care , Mr. Fenton , if you do n't bring any meals at all . " Mr. Fenton waited , as if he was thinking of something to say . Soon he was phoning the " front office . " " Ya know , " he said in a slow casual drawl , " I was just talking to this fellow Naeve , just kidding him about the meals . I mentioned the fact we could give him breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't bring over any food at all . " There was a silence , he was listening to the other end of the line . " O.K. , O.K. , " he concluded , and hung up . The next morning and the mornings after , I received breakfast . It appeared the needling by the officers was over , that for the rest of my time I 'd be left pretty much alone ... . One evening I showed a friendly officer called Holmes some of my landscapes , including an off-hand sketch of Warden Gerlach . The next day my cell was " shaken down , " literally every piece of drawing material was taken out . The order : I was not to have pencil or paper in my cell . When I wanted to write a letter , I had to ask a guard for paper and pencil ; when the letter was finished , the guard asked me to give everything back . With no materials to draw with , my disgust reached a 71 new low . Prisoners had offered to slip me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw or paint . I was weary of argument . Things that were taken from me before did n't seem to matter too much . But I had pulled into a cell , the last place I could go , and still they refused to leave me alone . Somehow at this point my loathing for the prison and the way it was run enveloped me . DECEMBER .. . As snows fell and the wind blew outside , the cell house became very cold . In the daytime I had to put on my coat and walk , or stay in bed . I would walk up and down till I got tired , then crawl into bed . When I got tired of lying down , I 'd walk some more . 72 December 7 . . . . A prisoner came rushing down to my cell : " Did you hear the news ? They 've bombed Pearl Harbor . It just came over the radio . " Shortly Gene Garst , whom I 'd met in quarantine , came to tell me the same thing . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's finally begun . Prisoners kept bringing the latest news flashes . In the evening a guard dropped by and asked : " I suppose you fellows will be joining the army now the country 's at war . " I told him it appeared to me that now was the most important time to object to the war ? the killing had begun . In two or three days everyone in the prison was making wild guesses . " The war will be over in six months . " Some said two years , some said " It 'll last ten years . " I felt miserably depressed . Two years , four years , ten years , seemed a long endless time in jail . The six months I had left had little meaning . I was sure I would not be set free . I expected several marshals to meet me at the green door as I went out . They would probably ask me to register , I would refuse . In a few days I would be right back in jail somewhere . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially among the war objectors . I had expected a patriotic wave to develop among the other prisoners , but nothing of the sort occurred . The men talked about the war , but mostly , as before , they looked forward to their release , worried about their time . The news of the war carried our interests till Christmas . With the exception of the improvement of the noon meal , Christmas Day went the same as all the rest . A few days later I received a letter from my mother , telling me she had sent a guitar for Christmas . The authorities refused to let me have it , had returned it to her . 73 There was the new year 1942 to look forward to . New Year 's Eve passed . The war news slipped into a regular place in everyone 's mind . Books were the only thing I was allowed to have . I began to do a lot of reading . This reading was almost the first I had done . On the outside I had gone into libraries many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the particular books I found were extremely dull . Gene Garst brought me Walden by Thoreau , Leaves of Grass by Whitman , Essays by Emerson , Toward Freedom by Nehru , and others . Through these authors I found my first real interest in books . I was always finding something . In Toward Freedom I found a poem by Blake that sort of fit in at the time : To see a world in a grain of sand , And a heaven in a wild flower , Hold infinity in the palm of your hand , And eternity in an hour . The grain-of-sand part fitted into what I had for some days been thinking . A cell wall faced me as I sat on my bunk . " My wall " was roughly finished concrete . There were millions of sand particles visible ; each grain of sand did appear like a world . There were planets here and there . Where the cement worker made his last swiping stroke , there was a swirl of sand particles that appeared much like the Milky Way . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I looked very closely there was an infinite amount of color ? grey , blue , blue-grey , a soft chill grey-yellow . I spent much time looking at the wall . It appeared to be subtly slowly changing . In January , in the daytime I had to put on all my clothes and get into bed , or walk briskly up and down to 74 keep warm . It did n't make much sense . There were cell houses that had heat all day . So I asked Captain Thieman through a note for a change to another cell house . The request was ignored . " My " cell was on the busiest corner of the cell house . I was put there , possibly , so the other prisoners might razz me and con me ? " Ya ca n't beat the system . " This did occur at first . But when the authorities baited me with the meals , would n't let me have pencil and paper to draw with , refused to move me to heated quarters , all this changed . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's the way , kid , " they would say , " it 's good to sec somebody make a chump out of ' em . Just stick to your guns . By the way , if there 's anything you need , just tell me . " The men smuggled me food from the officers ' mess ! ? officers ' eggs , officers ' cheese . They slipped me pastry , candy . On several occasions a guard smelled the odor of strong cheese and shook the cell down . A built-in shelf under the table-top held the cheese . The perplexed guard sniffed , hunted . The hidden shelf and the cheese were never found . One guard ( an antique ) was going in reverse . " They ought to allow you to paint . " He offered to smuggle a set of water colors into the prison ! In the evening the cell house 's sixty-five prisoners would be in from their work gangs ; the cell house would be full of activity , would swell with noise . I could hear a mandolin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreak of prisoners razzing each other . I could see , standing near my cell , the lookout for " the queers . " There was considerable homosexuality . If a man was known to be homosexually inclined , he was kept in a certain 75 section on the other side of the cell house . Since the men were n't locked up till ten o'clock , several of them stood lookout , while two others carried out the act in one of the third-tier cells . If the hack on duty started up the stairs , the man standing lookout on the first floor would wave up to the third-tier lookout ; he would warn the two who were having intercourse . In this way no one was ever caught . On one occasion a hack brought up the subject while standing in front of my cell talking to Inc . " What the hell can I do ? I go on one side of the house , and they do it on the other . " We agreed that if they permanently locked the men up it would only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if only partial , was to set the men free . At the end of January I began to look forward to spring . Like everyone else I hoped for warmer weather , pulled easier time . By February I knew most of the cell-house prisoners . 1 spent a good deal of time talking to two of the prison 's seven new war objectors . Paul , a tall large-handed young man , liked to stand in front of my cell and talk about religion . I told him how I could understand people praying in private , but I could n't understand people doing it in public out in front of everybode . Paul agreed , then read from his bible : " It says in Matthew , chapter six verse five , And when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are : for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seen of men . Verily I say unto you , they have their reward ' . " Paul always managed to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lloyd Shear , a Methodist minister , would sometimes conic for a talk . Lloyd had refused to register for the draft , 76 as he felt it was an act to promote war and killing . He was able to point to innumerable sections in the bible to support his anti-war point of view . " The scripture says , just plainly and straightly , Thou shalt not kill . ' Also it says , Do unto others as you would have done unto you . ' It seems pretty clear to nie . Christ meant for us to be anti-war . " In the middle of February , after 97 clays in the cell , just as I was looking forward to warmer days , a guard much to my surprise opened my cell gate , informed me : " You 're going to be moved . Get your mattress . " I never hesitated to leave , as it was nearly certain I would go to a warmer place , that the change would be for the better . 1z . February-June , 1942 . THE Segregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a two-story cell house projecting out into the prison yard . As the guard led me through the segregation door on the first floor , and we ascended the dusty stairway to the second floor , our each step echoed . The guard led me clown a short corridor , showed me into a cell , closed its solid steel door , left . I stood motionless for a minute , listened . The guard had informed me I was to be locked up with Harry Little , another war objector . It was very quiet ? sounded as though I was alone . 77 I might make a little noise , hum or something . If he 's already up here in one of the other cells , maybe he 'll make a little noise or something or say hello . I hummed awhile , whistled a bit unsteadily ? stoppedwaited ? decided to call out . I got down on my hands and knees , yelled out through the crack beneath my cell door : " Hello ! Anybody else up here ? " The words echoed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement somewhere . . . . ! " Hello ! " an answer came back . " Hello , where arc you ? " I yelled back excitedly : " I 'm in cell Q. I think . " " We must be next to each other , I 'm in P. " " Do you suppose we can talk out of the window ? Wan na try it ? " " O.K. " From window to window we could hardly hear each other . We next tried the ventilators over the toilet bowls . " Are you over there ? " " Ya . " " Boy , this works swell . By the way , are you the war objector I-Iarry Little ? " " Ya , and who are you ? " I told him . 78 " This is verrry , very good . Flow long have you been here ? " " About two minutes . And you ? " " I 've been up here about ten . " Harry 's voice was soft and mellow . I tried to visualize his features . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever get a chance to see him ? After we had talked through the ventilator about an hour , Harry queried : " Is your cell door open ? " " I think it 's locked . " " I believe mine 's open . Have you tried yours ? " " No . " I paused , turned enough to bring the green door into focus . " I 'm pretty sure mine 's locked ? It must be. ? Wait a minute , I 'll try it . " I got up and gave my cell door a slight push . It gave way ! I hurried back to the ventilator . " Hey , Harry , mine 's open ! " " Open ? " " Ya , open . It 's been open all the time . " We began to laugh . " Hey ? Hey , Harry . I 'll meet you out in the cor ridor . " I pushed my door open , stepped into the corridor . Simultaneously Harry stepped out of his cell . We grinned , enthusiastically shook hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow with long wavy blond hair . His eyes were fiery and deep-set ? they sparkled as he talked . As we walked down the corridor to the end room , he gestured slowly , measured long steps . That afternoon and evening we stayed in the end room . Harry told me of his wife Elizabeth , his four-year-old son Bronson . They lived on a farm near Tunbridge , Vermont . Harry unrolled the story of meeting his wife on an ocean 79 freighter , his trip to Europe to study the co-op movement , his working for the government in the Department of Agriculture . He told the story of the three of them leaving Washington , D. C. , for the farm in Vermont . " How come you left Washington and a good job ? " Harry explained he hated the cities . " They 're dirty filthy places , you ca n't get any sun . The city 's an awful place for kids to grow up in . People only live in the smoke , the dirty streets , because they have to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back out into the sun and fresh air . People have first to be healthy , live healthy and robust lives , to be happy . Tolstoy had the right idea ? away with the big dingy dirty unhealthy cities , back to the land . " It 's easy to leave the city , " he explained . " Anybody can do it . We did it on $200 . " Harry did n't believe in killing and war . When the draft came , he refused to register . For this he was sentenced to three months . At Danbury Harry objected to being dictated to . He was confined to segregation . Segregation contained five cells , a large end room , a shower-and-sink room , a small locked closet . The end room looked out over the prison yard , was very gloomy . The walls , the ceiling , the floor , were bare grey cement . In the center stood a lone object ? a large wooden table . When we spoke , our words echoed . Harry often walked up and down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in nay cell I could hear him going back and forth , thump , thump , thump . Sometimes as he 'd walk he 'd hum Finlandia . Our day was interrupted only for meals and for cell lockup at ten p.m . When Gene Garst was let in to bring us books , we considered it an occasion , as he was the only out- so side prisoner permitted to see us . We had no papers to read ; we heard very little about the war . We spent most of our time walking in the end room . Harry did considerable reading , writing . He was working on a book that dealt with the fun of moving from the city to the country on $200 . He called it " The New Peasant . " Talk revolved around several topics ? one , should we leave the country ? Harry : " I 've been thinking for some time of moving to a different country , as I figure things are going to get tighter and tighter here . " Then in glum resignation : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in jail , when we might go elsewhere and be free . " Harry would seldom look up ; he knew I felt pretty much the same . We spent much time looking out of the end-room windows . Segregation afforded an excellent view of the yard and all that happened in it . Watching the men take yard period on weekends and after work-hours was very interesting . We could somewhat tell a prisoner 's rap by watch-81 ing who he went around with . When we 'd spy a new prisoner , we 'd wonder what gang of men he 'd migrate to . We followed each little change in the weather . We could detect a shift in the wind by watching the direction the steam vapor took from the power house . We daily eyed the yard pick-and-shovel gang . They were still leveling the yard off , carrying off the stones . Whenever a truck would pull into the yard ( which was rare ) , we would wait to see what it was to unload or pick up . Occasionally when we 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " It 's hard to believe , but maybe in two or three hundred years this place will be a crumbling ruins ? sparrows will live in it , and people will come and look at the curious old place . " He 'd pause and reflect : " Nature has a way of continually tearing down the things man builds . If they leave this prison for a couple of hundred years , nature will tear it down and restore the top of the hill to grass and green trees . " At meal time , at the call of the bugle we could watch the other prisoners rush out of their cell houses . Two long lines like streams of black ink would race across the yard for the mess-hall door . The men would walk very rapidly . Hacks would watch them so they would n't run . The two long black lines rushed forward , grew longer , hit the messhall door . I would imagine the two long lines that formed inside . I could see the hacks patrolling the lines . I saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed , sitting down as directed . Each time I thought of these things , I was glad I was not in the regimentation . In twenty minutes the men would come out of the mess hall , go to their cell houses , rest for a few minutes , wait for the work whistle . When the whistle commanded , the men 82 gathered in a long dark line and moved in a semi-circle below the smokestack toward the work gate . The line crawled , moved slowly , ponderously , unwillingly . As we watched , Harry would often comment : " Look at that , just look at it . There they go , every day , every day the same . They 're slaves . Literally slaves . " Aside from the lines there were no big things to see , so the small things around us became magnified . The gloomy walls , the smell of the concrete , the being held in all the time , would irritate us . We would growl , occasionally our growls would turn to bitter argument . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the middle of March , the snow of winter began to thaw . Signs of the war began to appear . War planes en route to Europe were flying over the prison . Frequently we would see Warden Gerlach in the company of army visitors . Air-raid tests and blackouts were held frequently . The prison 's lights would go out , the prison 's escape siren would wail at an earsplitting pitch . In the latter part of March , I 'd finished nine months . 83 Harry and I began to wonder what would happen when my " good-time release " date came . The federal law reads that if a prisoner has done his time in " good conduct " he is entitled to 72 clays a year off his original sentence . If a prisoner smuggles something illegal , beats an officer , etc. , he loses the 72 days " good time " ; otherwise he automatically gets it . The terms of good-time release are very similar to the terms of parole . You have to report to a probation officer ( an outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the probation officer for permission to travel out of his district , get his O.K. before you can take a job . You have to ask him for permission to marry , etc . Re-imprisonment is his threat . To wit ? you are being dictated to . On April first I was told I could go home if I would accept a conditional release . My answer was no , I did n't want to live under a dictatorship on the outside . The next day a guard notified me : " They 're having a good-time trial for you . " When he said " trial " I knew what that meant , for no trial is held in prison for the benefit of the prisoner . I responded : " I prefer not going . " Then Captain Thieman made his appearance : " Are you coming to the trial ? " I told him I did n't want to go . " If you wo n't come voluntarily , I 'll have to send some men up after you . " I said nothing . Almost immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneasily about , pulled up hesitantly before me . It appeared they did n't like approaching me any more than I liked being approached . They stood before me , talked uneasily . Finally one of them pulled up 84 closer to take hold of me . I sat down quickly on the floor to emphasize that I was n't going to give them a battle , that I just wanted to be left alone . The four guards surrounded me . There was a nervous tension in the air . None wanted to be the first to grab , none the Iast . I was excited , but I managed to relax . Harry stood nearby , his eyes keenly focussed , angry . Slowly seconds seemed to pass . Finally after much stalling one guard made a motion to grab me ; all grabbed at the same time . They lifted me up . Harry called out words of criticism . The strong-arm squad reddened with embarrassment . I was carried downstairs . As the procession moved through the adjoining hallway , one of the minor prison employes stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sight , forgetting himself , he cheered out " Ataway , Naeve . " He gave a spirited wave of his hand ; he was extremely happy somebody was opposing " the system " ! At the end of the corridor we turned into one of the small front offices . I was carefully lowered onto a centrally-placed chair . Four guards stood outside ready to replace me should I leave where they had put me . At one end of the room sat three guards " jurors , " a stenographer , Captain Thieman , all appeared very ill at ease . The proceedings began with Captain Thieman asking me to sign and agree to the good-time parole restrictions . They asked me many questions , but it always came back to the point that I did n't want to be dictated to . I wanted complete freedom . After fifteen minutes , and nothing having been gained by the questioning , I was told the trial was over . Guards whose eyes avoided me were waiting to carry me back into segregation , but I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do the 85 72 days good time , that my release date had been moved from April to June 16 . I was gloomy and disappointed ? not for having to do 72 days more , but for speaking at the trial . The " trials " were , most prisoners knew , held to give a democratic front to the dictatorial decisions already made by higher officials . By cooperating with the trial I had made it appear like a trial . I told Harry : " I made a mistake by answering their questions . I should have said nothing . " Little by little the news trickled in that war objectors released from prison were n't being resentenced immediately . This , along with the fact that Harry and I had little time left , made us think about getting out , getting out into the country among hills and greenery . Harry talked of going back to Tunbridge , Vt . I was going to Jamaica , Vt . Each day we constructed our plans . I began to think a good deal about Madeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . I decided to write a letter . I worked most of two days , composed several ; none seemed appropriate . Finally I composed one telling her of my desire to get out into the country and live in sur-roundings of hills and trees ? how I wanted to build a small cabin , have a small garden . I ended by asking her to come to Vermont with me . Three days passed . For ten months I had spent a good deal of my time thinking about her , projecting in my mind all the things she might be doing . Now it became intensified ? for three days I thought of nothing else . Would she get the letter ? When would she get it ? Would she answer ? On the fourth day I received a very neatly written answer . She was going to get married . She ended the letter , " I wish you all the luck in the world . " Harry watched me very closely . I think he expected me 86 to go completely in the dumps , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural that in ten months she had come to work other things out . The desire to get away from Danbury was too persistent ; soon again I was looking forward to release . The days filled with plans for the first , the second , the third days in Vermont , etc . At the end of April Harry 's sentence expired . I missed the sound of his walking back and forth , our talks , our watching the work line together , his humming of Finlandia . By May , the days became sunny , the cell house warmer . Prisoners were beginning to walk in the yard after work hours in large numbers again . The new war objectors now and then stopped at the bottom of the segregation building , when hacks were n't around , to talk up . As it grew warmer I wanted very badly to get out into the fresh air and sun . I sent a note to Warden Gerlach and Captain Thieman . I told them I had not been outside in eight months , that I would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other prisoners . My request was ignored . The last two weeks . . . I nervously anticipated my release date . What was the outside like now that the war had begun ? I had heard stories of World War I hysteria . Would it be the same in this war ? How long would I be left free ? Seven days .... I could hardly wait . Each day seemed endless . The past year of " time , " the 97 days in the cold cell , shrank to unreality , the whole prison was already on the way to becoming an image in the past . It seemed at times I was already out . On June 13th ( two days and a get-up remaining ) I learned I was to be taken to the barber shop . It was to be my first time out of segregation . It felt like I was about to 87 make a big journey , equal if not greater than crossing the continent . When the time arrived and I was escorted down and out of segregation across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It felt as though I were down very low , walking in the bottom of a pit . The buildings surrounding the yard loomed tremendously high . The grass in the now-sodded yard looked greener . I could smell the ground . The air was unbelievably fresh , the sun unbelievably warm upon my back . As I walked along , other prisoners stopped in twos and threes , stared at my long hair . It had not been cut in months , it nearly touched my shoulders . In the barber shop I felt very conscious that I was talking to men I 'd never spoken to before . The individuals around me were at ease and casual , made me realize I was extremely tense and jumpy . When I spoke , I heard each word as a separate piece , was very conscious of each individual syllable . As the other men spoke , I could hardly keep from watching their facial , lip expressions . I told the other prisoners about segregation . One of them made the comment : " I did n't even know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16th . . . . I was standing at the top of the stairs that led out of segregation . I was waiting to be called . This was my day to go home . As I stood at the top of the stairs , I thought of Madeline ? the promise to wait she had made a year ago . I saw the court-room trials ? the first judge , the second judge , the third . I thought of West Street , Madeline 's visits , the first night in West Street Jail , the first night in Danbury . I recalled these things in a quick flash . I thought of the other war objectors ? Harry , Gene , Al , Scotty , and Schoenfeldt. 88 . . . I heard a key in the door before me . It went C-L-I-C-K . . . . C-I-i-c-k startled me . The key turned the lock . I waited for the door to open . As I waited for the door to open , there was a feeling as though the moment for me to leave had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My nervous emotions began to turn , whirl . I felt the excitement within me rise . 13 . June , 1942 , to February , 1943 . FOR a year I had been in nothing that moved . To be sitting still , yet moving , was a fantastic feeling . The train raced ahead . Trees flashed by , whipped back , nearly uprooted by the gust of wind . It felt like I was sitting in the tube of a long rocket being shot forward at terrific speed . The hills at this first impression appeared unbelievably green , a lush rich velvety green . I looked and looked at the green and its endless variations . I could hardly believe what I saw . I noticed numerous men in army uniform . There were none on the trains a year before . The headlines in the paper ahead of me ? they were the first war headlines I had seen . As the train rushed ahead , it felt as though everything was becoming newer and more different ? that the train was headed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrow to the target . I felt very uncomfortable , " Dear ole Morn , " I thought , 89 The day he began shouting , the guards were instructed to lock him up . Mercier did not understand when a guard told him to get into his cell . Twenty minutes passed . Several guards began collecting in the corridor . It was the " goon squad , " the biggest guards available . They had come to put Mercier in his cell . Expecting a struggle and possibly a scene , the " goon squad " made all the other prisoners in the hospital get out of view . 1 thought to myself : when a man started going insane , why did the authorities most always get tougher , lock the man in a cell , when confinement was the direct cause ? Why did n't they give mental cases greater freedom ? Mercier did n't have too much time left . Why did n't they rush a parole through for him ? Why call out the goon squad ? My face was against my small cell-door window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercier had stopped pacing up and down and shouting . He had evidently sensed something was up . I saw the guards move down the hall toward him . Soon they were past my angle of vision . The rest was sounds . The goon squad neared the end of the hall . Mercier was trapped . I imagined his bewilderment , the glassy look in his eye . There was an extreme quiet in the hospital . Word had evidently got around what was going to happen . It was very quiet . Suddenly , sharply " Stay away from me . Stay away from me , you goddamned son of a bitches ! " ? Bam . . . bam . . . slap . . . The guards were lashing out at Mercier . ? Bam ... Bam . . . Crack .... I had my ear to the door . I went breathless . My body chilled , went weak at the sound of each blow . There was a loud growl : " You goddamned bastards , 65 you goddamned motherfuckin ' bastards , that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Take it easy , take it easy . " ? Barn . . . Barn ? Wham ? There were little seconds of quiet , then another series of Barn-Barns and cracks . At each attack I became more chilled , sickened . There was a muffle of sounds , of many feet shuffling in desperation , a confusion of dull thuds and sounds . Then a long groan . Oh-000000 ? Oh-000000 Then in a crying voice : " You goddamned fuckin ' bastards , you son of a bitches , you goddamned son of a bitches , leave me alone ! " Then tiredly , hoarsely : " You goddamned bastards , you bastards . " At each outbreak I could feel my emotion building up more and more ... feel myself go completely hollow . I kept thinking : Why did n't they leave him alone , just wait till he got into the cell , and then lock the door ? I could hear a kick of feet now and then . Sometimes a desperate groan and a flurry of muffled sounds amid deep breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . The guards passed my cell , their hands clamped on Mercier 's arms and legs . His clothes were torn and dragging on the floor . Three weeks before he weighed 170 pounds , now no more than 140 . His thin face was sweaty , smeared and waxen . He twitched and turned , still trying to free himself . My emotions rushed upward . Without thinking , I got quickly to the floor on my hands and knees , and yelled out under the cell door : " Hey , you out there , do n't you know how to treat a human being ? " It echoed , re-echoed in the hall . I paused , then slowly : " You ought to be ashamed of yourselves . " The guards with their burden were just a little past 66 " you 've sent my brother 's clothes . I look like Charlie Chaplin ! " It was hard to believe that Gene Garst and the rest were still back in Danbury . . . . I pulled close to the window to avoid the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to anyone . I only hoped that I would soon get to where it was quiet , to Vermont , into the hills and green . High in the Green Mountains of Vermont , fou miles up and above the small village of Jamaica , there is a place called the Jacob Farm . The locale is very bountiful , beautiful . The mountains are well covered with timber , the fields with berries , flowers , the streams full of trout . I had about $400 in savings . For a long time I had wanted to build a cabin up in the mountains somewhere . I decided that since the cabin was the uppermost adventure wanted to have , now was the time to have it . I might soon be back in jail . I wanted the interim to be as bright and different as I could possibly make it . Mr. Jacob gave me permission to build on the corner of his eight hundred acres . I bought an ax , shovel , brace and bit , and a few other things , began assembling sod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a view of over thirty miles . Below and in front of the cabin lay a tremendous valley . Every morning as I would leave the neighbor 's where I stayed and start out for the cabin over the fields and up onto the hill , I wondered what I would find out over the valley . Some mornings it would be misty ; all I could see was the hazy delicate profile of the big , lonely elm , midway down the field . On some mornings the valley appeared like a fantastic lake . It would be full of clouds . Sometimes the air would be tense , clear , glassily fresh , thunderheads would assemble to the north , the mountainsides would be dark 90 grey and solemn , the trees would stand awaiting for the storm to break . Some days the shadows of the clouds like great wandering carpets would just lazily coast over the mountainsides . On any day and every day , it was something new , something different , to me amazing . Watching the valley , being in it , I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no tension , where it was quiet . After working on the cabin two months , finishing the exterior , I decided to go where there was more social life . I wanted to cure my feeling ill at ease among people . In New York City I visited some of the war objectors I 'd met at Danbury , went to see some of the " older men " ? those who had objected to World War I in 1917 . They told me 91 of being in prison during the last war ; we exchanged experiences . Restlessness , uncertainty set in . After visiting friends in Massachusetts , New Hampshire , and earing some money , I decided to go home for Christmas . In Sioux City I visited old school friends , some of my former school teachers . Most of them did n't seem to mind my being a war objector and having been in prison . They treated me as always , listened with interest . While in Sioux City , I worked in one of the downtown cafeterias . On off-work hours I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had plenty of time to think and look about . I discovered that Sioux City and the river were extremely beautiful , as beautiful as anything I 'd ever seen . I enjoyed the walks , enjoyed seeing the town and old friends . But I was becoming irritable , impatient . More and more war objectors were being put in jail . I heard that one or two had been resentenced to a second term . Everything was war ! Killings ! Prison Why paint ? I no longer wanted to paint , saw no purpose in painting . The people in the world were destroying all that was good in it . They were destroying the best in it . Themselves . On the visits to my mother 's house I frequently took out the paintings I had stored there , looked at them . They looked dead , lifeless , meaningless . One afternoon in a mood of despondency I put them in a pile , set fire to them . After six weeks in Sioux City I decided to go to Colorado and visit my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver by train , by bus , by auto , but each time , the train or bus went ? whiz ? and there I was . I never got a chance to really see the country . For a long time I had 92 thought about going on a long travel-hike . It was an adventure I wanted to have some day . A friend was driving from Sioux City to the Kansas-Oklahoma line . From there I could begin , walking due west . I could proceed toward the New Mexico line , then go north till I came to Denver . I imagined the country I might see , the adventures I might have . I had warm clothes and walking boots , so it was again why not go now , I might soon be in " the can . " On the first of February , 1943 , I went with my friend to the Kansas-Oklahoma line , started to walk due west on a narrow dirt road . The farm lands , the green winter wheat just coming up , went on and on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land mass as never before . The country I walked through seemed much vaster than the country I was used to riding through . I got to see the little things that made up the big things I used to see as I went by in a car . It was a completely new way of travel . The more I walked the more I felt that I was really on the biggest adventure I 'd ever undertaken . I could see the various farm houses with their cluster of buildings around them . The contrasts were as varied and numerous as the houses . Some of the farms were stately and well-kept . I 'd see a big new but mud-spattered auto in the yard . The chickens would be all white , there would be all Hereford cattle grazing in the green of the winter wheat . The next distant farm would be a cluster of old buildings . There would be parts of old autos and tractors in the front yard . The chickens would be of all colors , the fields would be half-plowed . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the plow rusted into the ground . Farther on down , a house close to the road ? it would be battered and broken , abandoned . I would go into the house , look around . 93 I talked to the people , played with dogs , looked over the sage hedges , watched the rabbits , walked across eroded waste lands of red clay , followed a small river for a while . I stayed purposely off the highways , went on the little back roads . On the second day , in the afternoon , after I 'd covered about forty miles , I walked into a little town whose hl t ) . - foot rise commanded the naked plains around . It had no sign on the slowly rising outskirts saying you are now approaching Anthony , Kansas , such and such a population . It was just there . The town was larger than most of the towns I 'd seen . It had a library . I decided to spend the afternoon in ' tnthony , then walk out of town a ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange for the night 's lodging . In the morning , start walking again . I bought a few things to eat . Because of the poor food , I immediately became ill . I decided to take a room in one of the two hotels in town . I inquired the price ? the price was very high . While I was making up my mind what to do , a townsman suggested to me that Bart , the sheriff , who kept the county jail , was a very nice fellow . He said that when men wanted a place to stay , Bart gladly let them sleep in " the clink . " I thought of all the stories I had heard others tell of shacking up at night at this or that county jail . I decided to give it a try . When I arrived at the place in the center of town where 1 was to find Bart , I came upon the other two town marshals . I asked if they knew where Bart was . I told them that I wanted to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old man of the two told me that if I wanted , he 95 would take me over , but I would have to wait awhile . The old marshal was very friendly : " I do n't know why somebody should n't use the place ? it 's clean , the heat 's on , and no-body 's in it . " The other marshal , a man about thirty-five , was a mus tached drug-store sharpie . His cigaret hung from his upper lip , his hat was cocked at a sharp angle . As the old man talked , the younger marshal nudged him : " Ask him if he 's got a draft card . " The old man hesitated . " I 'm supposed to ask every body ? got a draft card , son ? " " I do n't carry one . " There was a short pause . I told hint I was anti-war , that I did a year in prison , for refusal to cooperate with the draft . The old man listened carefully , believed me , told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " If you still want to spend the night in the jail , O.K. If not , O.K. It 's up to you . " The young marshal , however , appeared suspicious . I could see that he was plotting to turn the old man against me . As a last-minute gesture to avert this , I told the old man that I would go to the library and read for an hour or so ; then I would come back and go with him to the jail , spend the night . The old man seemed satisfied . I went to the library , sat down , began to read . Ten minutes later , the two marshals rushed in . The old man had a pained look on his face , a sweat on his forehead . I could see the young fellow had talked to him . The old marshal wiped his brow , said regretfully : " I guess , son , we 're goin ' to have to take you over and lock you up . " The young marshal with his hairline mustache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fact that he had been the cause of my arrest . 96 14 . February-April , 1943 . I WAS locked into the Anthony , Kansas , county jail . As I walked around inside , saw the open gates , the many empty cells , I felt alone . I was the only prisoner . I heard every little sound I made . I wondered if I would be set free doubt it ? no ? neverfelt despondent ? miserable " County jail " was very quiet . It seemed it was void of all life , always had been . I looked forward to the visits my keeper paid me . The sheriff , " Bart , " was big , good-natured , boyish-looking . Bart would come once a clay , would always say the same : " If there 's anything you need or want , ask me . I 'll get it for you . " Then he 'd say : " I 've got a very clean jail here . I 've learned it pays to keep a clean jail . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to myself ? time to think , speculate , time to hope . Outside of the regular prison works , there were just three things of interest . One , scribbled on the walls of each cage were jingles , rhymes , pictures of girls , tirades against Anthony 's most prominent citizens . Two , there was a large spotlessly clean , victorian bathtub in one of the cells . Three , the only reading matter , an old battered bible which had many of its pages missing . I had seen all , so to speak . The only other thing to do was look out the monster 's huge ribs , the barred windows . 97 North of the jail one block away was the business section of town , main street . Between the jail and the backs of the stores that lined main street was a vacant lot . Then , surely now and forever , two young girls come there to play . Sometimes they pitch horseshoes , sometimes they play catch with a ball . From the east windows the houses of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brown , drab ; like the houses in the paintings of Burchfield . The town looked as though it had been built up in 1899 and nothing had been added . To the south , from the only other exposure with windows , stood the town 's most prominent landmark  --  the county court-house . The court-house was a very old brick building . It had a high Paul Revere tower in which were both an illuminated clock and a bell . It was a very " solitary " feeling to stand at night , look through the bars and the bare limbs of the huge trees in the court yard , read the illuminated clock , hear the bell toll . 98 After sitting a week , I felt sure I was going to be resentenced and imprisoned a second time . I came again to have a growing disgust for the government and those who were putting me in jail . The government , that nebulous thing made up of money interests and politicians , was imprisoning me , trampling , trying to destroy part of my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see that it is a crime to refuse to kill and that I should be put in jail for it . Each day I was more certain I 'd be resentenced . My disgust grew , swelled in me . I felt like I wanted to fight back ? but how ? It seemed ridiculous to think of fighting back . The cards were stacked . I could be imprisoned at the movement of a pen . Just as I was getting used to the jail and listening to myself walk in it , getting used to looking out of the windows and hearing the bell toll , two federal marshals came . They put handcuffs on me , put Inc in a Chevrolet , drove northward out of town . I wondered if I was going to be ' 99 tried . It appeared I might have to do time in the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth .. . After a few hour 's drive , we arrived in Wichita . In the heart of town : a tall dirty brown building . We entered . Rough hands pawed all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Keep your hands off of me . The rough hands roamed all over my back , my foreparts , through my pockets , then carefully patted my legs to be sure there was nothing there . " Got anything on ya ? " the deputy sheriff asked . " Pens , knives , papers . . . ? If ya got anything on ya , put it on the counter . " As we left the office I noticed on the other side of the counter all the other Wichita deputies . They hardly noticed me . They were more aware of their cigars ; they filled the air with cigar smoke ; they leaned back comfortably , their hats were back , their feet up on the desks . We ascended three flights of steel stair-works , passed through several barred gates . On the third floor I was locked foe into a long extremely narrow bull pen . Its inhabitants were sitting on blankets and pails , playing cards . The floor was grimy with dirt , strewn with scraps of old newspaper , blackened matches , flattened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dump , most of the men looked up from their poker hands , but ignoringly . I looked for a face that seemed interested . After a bit one of the men wandered over . " Hello , just come in ? " Soon we were talking about most everything . He told me how he was picked up at his folks ' farm , how he had been treated coining in , how long he 'd been locked up . I learned that we got two meals a day ; that someone had escaped the week before ; that upstairs was an old couple who were being held for the murder of a child who died from a spanking . " Every once in awhile , at night , they take the old man downstairs , probably to grill him . We 've seen them bring him back , looking awful tired . Maybe they punch him around a bit . " From talking to the men , I found that more than half of the eighteen men in the bull pen were Jehovah 's Witnesses , objecting to military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . I sat in on several of their meetings . They talked about the Millenium and the Coming of Christ . They declared they 'd fight in a war in which Christ was their leader , but would not fight for worldly powers . The other men in the cell row were being held for whiskey , gambling . One had escaped from the federal prison at El Reno , Oklahoma , one from an Arkansas road camp . The young escapee from El Reno said : " I was tired of sittin ' in the can . I wanted to see my girl friend , and that was all there was to it . " The older man from the Arkansas road camp put it : " Boy , down there they beat a man , treat a man something awful . So I got out of there . . . . 101 Boy , will I get a beating when I get back . " ... At ten o'clock the night marshal locked us up , two in a cell , turned out the lights . I waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'he marshal had given us cheese to bait the traps . The traps were out in the corridor , tied by cord to the bars . There was a whisper .... " Here comes one . " I strained to see the rats crawling along the windowed building wall just outside the bull pen bars . A second whisper : " Here comes another . " The rats moved slowly along the wall . The air was quiet , stilled , no one stirred , all watched . A rat darted from the shadowy wall , hesitantly ran behind the bars between the wall and the cells . One of the men threw something . The rat , leary , held back . The men knew the rats would be there all night , so they went to sleep . The rats waited . Soon there was snoring and quiet . I could see a rat or two dart into the cells . I could hear the rats in the men 's cells , going through the food , fruit or peanuts that some friend had brought them . After awhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snap ; the rats stayed away from them and the cheese that was in them . I went to sleep . . . . In the morning we got up . There was little soap , we washed as best we could . We could look out of the windows beyond the bars . All we could see was a small court . It was full of police motorcycles . As the days proceeded and the newness of the place faded , the idea of others imprisoning me again began gnaw- 102 ing away at me , making me irritable . With each succeeding day I became more convinced that I would not be set free . I expected I would be tried in Wichita along with the rest of the war objectors and sent with them to Leavenworth . Most of the men were getting five years . To occupy my time , I talked , watched the card games . I gathered all the pencils I could , drew two huge neaps of the world on my steel-grey cell walls . Most of the prisoners had some sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wichita prisoners , I began to wait for Saturday to roll around . We hoped and waited for Saturday . The Salvation Army came then and sang for us . " It 's crazy , " was the general comment , " but it breaks the monotony . " At fourteen days , just as I was beginning to take it for granted I would be resentenced in Wichita , two marshals came . They put handcuffs on three of us , put us into an auto . " Where are you taking us ? " " We 're drivin ' you boys to Kansas City . " On the outside the Kansas City , Kansas , jail is of clean brick , modern and streamlined . It has the taste , the design , the dignity of a public building . The beauty of the jail goes as far as the facade , which is as wide as the building is wide , as high as the building is high , and as deep as a layer of brick . We no more than passed through the prisoners ' gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirtiest jail I 'd ever seen . It looked as though the building behind the facade had been abandoned for many years ; then , without cleaning it up , the officials had moved the prisoners hack in . The cell block ? or granite box as I thought of it that I found myself in was the filthiest , the most crowded yet . Papers , cans , cigaret butts , rubbish ? just like Wichita 103 ? littered the floor . The bars were greasy and handworn . The men were tired-looking ; some had tried to wash their clothes but for the most part their shirts and trousers were WOrn and soiled . Aside from the pitiful uneatable meals ( mostly oatmeal , bread and . potatoes ) there were only five things to look forward to : reading , joking stories of jail , cards , checkers , and dominoes . I took more to conversation . I was finally getting over the self-consciousness I had developed in segregation at Danbury . I talked and played dominoes with most of the men ; one , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one other possible thing to do . We might answer the kid , " the juvenile , " who kept calling out from his nearby isolated cell block . He was tough , maybe a lot like Dillinger , he thought . He had stolen a car ; he had his women , this babe and that babe . " I was doin ' all right even in jail , " so he claimed , " but somebody squealed on me that I was carrying an automatic in my jockstrap . " One of the other things we could do , we could talk to the " juvenile . " One thing different about Kansas City : The men had gotten tired of being locked up in their cells at night and had clone something about it . They had torn open the long housing above the sliding cell doors , and jimmied the lever works . The doors would n't close any more . One night , to everyone 's delight , two young AWOL soldiers began yanking the levers out of their housing ( the guard on duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the one that closest resembled a sledge-hammer , and began pounding on the wall . The army " engineers " pounded , swore , pounded , swore , then pounded some more . The boys worked themselves into a terrific sweat but they hardly dented the granite . 104 : 1 slow week passed . Then one morning I was told to get ready . Two marshals took me by auto to the Kansas City train station . There we boarded a stream-liner , with state room accommodations to New York City ! The marshals , holsters on their hips , watched over Inc . At night when I wanted to sleep I was given one of the stateroom 's beds . Leg irons were put on me to prevent escape . The second evening we were pulling out of a town just outside of Chicago . To the left of the train ? a prison . It looked like an old castle ; the walls were of grey brownstone blocks . Very high , the corner towers , the sentry was keeping watch pacing back and forth . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too good , it seemed , for Citizen Naeve . Upon arrival in New York City , just as we were leaving Grand Central Station . we passed a soldier-prisoner coming in with a Military Police escort . He was handcuffed to one of his guards . I wondered what they had arrested him for . Were we thinking and feeling the same things ? Where were they taking him ? The two Kansas marshals took me to Foley Square and into the U. S. Court House . I was locked into the courtroom bull pen , same as two years before , put in the same van , taken to Test Street Jail . Lepke was still in his cell . He looked just as calm and cool as ever , just a little older , a little more worried-looking possibly . Louis Capone , Hymie Weiss , had been moved to Sing Sing . They were in the death house awaiting the electric chair . After being processed , I walked around to the different cages , inquired : " Any war objectors around ? " There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four were 105 locked up for refusing to take orders , etc . I tried to make contact with them . Shortly , for the same reason , I was locked up myself . One of the locked-up objectors was in the next cage ? his name Mat Kauten . There was a steel wall between us ; we could n't see each other , but we could hear one another very well . Mat told me that before imprisonment he had painted covers for the Saturday Evening Post and other magazines . Mat had several intense interests . He played violin in the New Rochelle Symphony . He was studying to be an architect . He talked of building an experimental low-cost house , of rammed earth , for $1,000 . " The lumber interests wo n't like it , they wo n't be able to sell any lumber , " he 'd laugh . " I 've read up on it . The government has put out some good scientific data on it , and they not only say it can be done , but they show it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some very good examples . Why , down in Washington , D. C. , there 's a two-story job , as good as any house , and it 's 178 years old . " Occasionally Mat would send over a sketch for me to look at , as an illustration of how a good thousand-dollar house could be built . One Saturday night we were let out to go to the prison 's movies . Mat was about my height , but huskier ; around 36 , with greying hair around the temples . His face was one of moving expressions , easy to read . He grinned , joked , was full of an extreme enthusiasm that drew others to listen . As I passed Mat 's cage on the way to the movies , I took a special look in to see Clarence . Clarence was about 35 , medium size , pleasant-looking . I had talked to him frequently . His story everyone in the jail knew . He had plotted to kill President Roosevelt . He wanted to walk 106 up to the President wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going to set the bomb off . He was willing to lose his own life in the process . Clarence had been battered around so much in his life that what he wanted was to get near what he thought was the source of his misery ? strike back , get even . After a month in West Street I had been in jail over two months , and still no trial . I felt I could do much more for myself on the outside . I could see people , speak to them , try to stop my being sentenced again . Through a prisoner who was going out , I got in touch with an organization called the War Resisters League , asked them to provide my bail . Since I was not a member , I wondered if they would help me . Two days later over the loudspeaker : LOWELL NAEVE TO THE RECEIVING ROOM . . . LOWELL NAEVE TO THE RECEIVING ROOM . My cell gate was unlocked . My civilian clothes were given me . I nervously put then on . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon to the federal court house , in Foley Square . There I met my bondsman , signed with him a $2,000 bail-bond , was set free . 107 1S . April-May , 1943 . Two war objectors , Stan Murphy and Lou Taylor , had been on a hunger-strike at Danbury for sixty days . ' Their demand was the release of war objectors from the camps and prisons . While out on bail , I stayed with some ex-Danbury war objectors on a New Jersey farm . Each day as I walked on the railroad tracks from the farm where I stayed to the one where I worked , I got a chance to think about Murphy and Taylor . Murphy and Taylor had entered Danbury after my release ; I did not know them . I first heard of their hungerstrike at West Street . In the beginning . I could n't see any sense to the idea , but the more I thought about it the more I became convinced that their hunger-strike was doing more for the men in jail than anything else . The extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war objectors were being sent to prison . It was stirring a few anti-war people to thinking that something ought to be done . There loomed , however , two big questions : What could be done ? Why did n't somebody help them ? Each day as I walked to and from work , I turned over in my mind what I might do . I was going to be put in jail soon , that seemed certain . I could then join the hungerstrikers , others might join . It appeared to me Ave had in a group of hunger-strikers our only way to freedom and being left alone . 108 I thought it over carefully . The strike was getting near the seventy-five day mark . I thought of giving up bail , joining the strike ? without support , Murphy and Taylor might give up . I decided to take a week to think it over . The week passed . I still felt that joining the strike was the thing to do , so I quit my job . The next morning I got up early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went enthusiastically to my bonding company , asked them to withdraw my bond . The company representative told me he would n't remove the bail . He insisted I go see the U. S. Marshal . I went to the U. S. Marshal 's office . When I told him I wanted to give up bail and go back to West Street , he became suspicious . He hesitated , told me they would n't take me back . I was determined to join the strike somehow . Why not do the hunger-strike on the steps of the federal court house , where I could talk to people , and explain to them why I was doing it ? I might not only give momentum to the Xfurphy-Taylor strike , but I might be able to stop my own resentencing . I decided to visit a friend who worked at the War Resisters League nearby . I thought it would be best to tell him what I was going to do , so he could explain to others if necessary . While I was talking to him the news came over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hours earlier , the eighty-second day . I had waited too long , as everyone else had waited too long . I felt painfully disturbed at the thought . There was still my second sentence to stop . Since I was one of the first to be put in for a second time , I still felt I should hunger-strike on the court-house steps . I might be able to bring to people 's attention the fact that men 109
