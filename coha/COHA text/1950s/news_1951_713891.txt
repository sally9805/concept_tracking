LOUNSBURY , ROBERT g. 27 Letters to The Times Council Presidency Discussed Parties ' Choice for City Election- in November Criticized , Praised To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : At the very moment when the governmental administration of the City of New York is at the lowest moral ebb since the days of Boss Tweed , and when through public investigations a minor portion of this political cesspool has been exposed to the public , the leaders of the Liberal and Republican parties continue to fiddle while New York burns . They have played every conceivable form of hide and seek with each other , interspersed with occasional pious pronouncements , and their behavior to date indicates only that the cause of good government again will be sacrificed for the sake of pettifogging politics . The writers of this letter are , and always have been , committed to the cause of good government . They will continue to bend their time and efforts in its behalf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halley for the presidency of the City Council , thereby reversing its original position in favor of coalition on the candidacy of Congressman Jack Javits , jeopardizes the cause of good government . Congressman Javits has been and will remain the choice of this body for the presidency of the City Council in next fall 's election . He is the only man upon whom the Republican and Liberal parties cbuld and would , and still can , coalesce . And under any circumstances he is the best man to drive an entering knife into the cancerous administration now infecting this city with bankruptcy and despair . We vigorously urge that his designation as the coalition candidate be effected without further delay . CHARLES T. STEWART , Chairman , The Board of Governors of the New York Young Republican Club . New York , June 9 , 1951 . Mr. Halley 's Qualifications To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The unholy alliance between the politicians and criminals uncovered by the Kefauver Crime Committee  --  always suspected and now definitely proven at the televised hearings in New York ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The question is : What's. to be done ? It needs the right man to lead a campaign in the spirit of Mayor La . Guardia . In my humble judgment this man is Rudolph Halley , recently designated by the Liberal party for the second highest position in the city government , the PresideRcy of the City Council . Halley has achieved a. reputation for his probing tenacity , his legal skill and a very wide knowledge of the evil forces influencing our city government . I can not understand the hesitancy of the Republicans in not fusing their resources with the Liberals on the election of this man , Is it simply because , it is said , the Liberals " jumped the gun " in being first to endorse Halley ? Surely it is time that picayune politics were subordinated in the superior issue of good government . Representative Javits is needed more than ever in Congress in these tense national and international upheavals , and it would be a crime to take this exceptionally intelligent and able man from his important duties in the nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the City Council as proposed by the Republican party . And should he lose the race in New York his prestige in Congress would not he enhanced by any means . Rudolph Halley offers New York City its greatest opportunity since La Guardia days to bring back good clean government . JOHN LYONS . New York , June 9 , 1951 . Teachers ' Advantages Cited To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The interesting comparative study of teachers ' salaries by the White Plains Board of Education bears out my convictions of long standing that teachers in this area do not know how well off they are on present salaries . If anything , the report was certainly weighted in favor of the teachers . It is difficult to believe that teachers anywhere work on an average 451/2 hours a week . That would be from 9 to 6 or from 8 to 5 . It is also apparent that a comparison of the teachers , 74 per cent of whom are women , with a group of professional people who are mostly men is hardly fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered their services in business , would find themselves in the stenographer class . Nor apparently was the liberal pension arrangement of the teachers taken into consideration , and the long vacations which they can turn into extra money if they desire . Even so , your headline , " Myths of Teaching Upset by Analysis , " is very I refreshing . THEODORE 0 . SMITHERS . New York , June 8 , 1951 . Federal Economies Asked TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In THE TIMES of June 7 I find a report on the speech made by Secretary John W. Snyder before the State Advisory Committee to the New York Savings Bond Division . Mr. Snyder is reported to have criticized persons who have blamed " Government spending as a came of inflation . " He is reported to have said that because Government receipts during his five years in office have exceeded Government expenditures by seven billion dollars , Government spending could not be charged with adding to inflation . Inflation is essentially caused by faster increase in the money supply than in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money spent by the Federal Government produces no goods and services of any value , I think it is obvious that much of the Government spending increases the money supply without increasing the supply of goods and services . The hundreds of thousands of people on the Government payroll who put in time in the manner reported by the Hoover Commission , many doing . nothing 75 per cent of the time , others producing useless reports , others filing papers which were not only of no value but cost business men time and money to prepare  --  all received spendable money for their time . That money then competed with the money of those who actually produced , and undoubtedly furnished a part of the inflation . The Federal Government could help avoid further depreciation in the buying power of the proceeds of " E " bonds by transferring at least a half million Federal civilian employes to productive work of almost any character .

Geography Survey Findings Value of Commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your examination in geography suggests that the reason why colleges and high schools do not teach more geography is because so much of the geography taught by geography teachers is of so little value to anyone but a geography teacher . Why should any normally intelligent , average college graduate waste his time and clutter his mind with such trivia as a difference of 0.2 million in the populations of Philadelphia . and Detroit , or the relative size of the Indian and Arctic Oceans , or the principal exports of Honduras ? Who hut a meteorologist cares , whether the a , erage January temperature in Miami is 67 degrees or 66 degrees Fahrenheit ? We know Miami is warm and Minneapolis cold and we do n't need a. three-semester hour course in geography to tell us which way to go for skiing or swimming . So I do n't know that one degree of latitude covers seventy miles . I 've lived for forty-nine years without suffering any great , pain from my ignorance of that fact , and I can not recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been of the slightest value to me . Maybe in your business you need to know that . the , Indus River is in Pakistan . I do n't . Nor do millions of other contented , prosperous ard useful American citizens . An educated man Is a man who knows where to find such facts a.s these when and if he needs them ; lie is not a. walking encyclopedia of useless information . Do you think any college graduate would not have sense enough to go to a library if he needed any such facts as these above ? ROBERT HoPPOcK . Professor of Education , New York University . New York , June tl , 1951 . Repeal of Subversives Bill Urged To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : We have noted with interest TM , NEW YORK TIMES editorial of May 28 entitled " Richardson and Nimitz , " in which reference is made to the recent dispute in the Subversive Activities Control Board hearings which resulted in the temporary resignation of Charles M. LaFollette as presiding officer of the panel . In THE TIMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoard is operating " stems from what ran only he described as the vindictiveness of the Senate Judiciary Committee and its chairman , Senator Pat McCarran , author of the very law under which the board was set up . " It is our feeling that situations such as occurred with reference to Mr. LaFollette will continue to occur as long as any attempt , is made 1.6 enforce the un-American McCarran Act , Such repressive , unconstitutional and unworkable legislation as the McCarran Act can only result in confusion . What happened last week in the hearings in Washington is additional evidence of the need to repeal this act . Congressman Adolph J. Sabath of Illinois , dean of the House and chairman of the House Rules Committee , has introduced H. R. 3118 for this purpose . H. R. 3118 deserves the support of every American . Dr , E.
