In Detroit , Hudson Motor Car Co. last week gave its dealers their first look at a new low-priced car to compete with Ford , Chevrolet , Studebaker and Plymouth . So far unnamed and unpriced , the car is 60 in. high , weighs 2,800 Ibs. , midway between a Ford and a Henry J , has a new 100 h.p. engine which will get about 20 miles per gal . A one-piece , curved windshield and a large rear window give it more glass area than most low-priced cars . Hudson hopes to get a four-door model into production by Thanksgiving , will add a two-door version later . Estimated production : 200,000 of the new cars next year , in addition to Hudson 's standard line ( current annual output : 125,000 ) .
