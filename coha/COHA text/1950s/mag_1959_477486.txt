A backstage portrait of " the greatest craftsman in his profession , " as lie goes about the sweaty , imaginative , and complex business of creating a new work of art . ANYONE bewitched by the notion of theatrical life as a giddy phenomenon nourished by champagne and midnight suppers might do well to take a look , as I did recently , at the bulletin board that hangs backstage at the New York City Center . One notice , posted among congratulatory telegrams , casting information , and rehearsal schedules , read : " Memo from Lucy Brown . If enough people are interested I should be glad to give a class in elementary fundamentals of music , especially as related to body movement . All those interested sign below . " In the midst of a ten-week season calling for five to six hours of rehearsal a day to prepare for eight performances every week , during which as many as twenty different ballets might be alternated , ten members of the New York City Ballet , including an internationally celebrated ballerina , signed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were strictly on the level , it was pointed out by Miss Brown , who is a rehearsal pianist for the company . In fact , " she said , ' ' two of the names are ringers . But it 's still a nifty response , do n't you think ? " I agreed and asked for an explanation of the rehearsal schedule posted nearby . It was filled with fairly cryptic messages . The top line , forexample , read : " Monday , 3-5 P.M. , Nuts . " This , Miss Brown explained , meant that all the dancers involved in the company 's production of " The Nutcracker " had been required to report on-stage that afternoon . Below " Nuts , " another line read : - Monday , 7-10 P.M. , Rieti , entire cast . " " Rieti , " Miss Brown told me , was the working title of a new ballet I had been invited to observe in rehearsal ; it was scheduled to open in two weeks . On-stage , fourteen dancers ? the entire cast of " Rieti " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them passed the time by shuffling listlessly about in the dim yellow lights , stopping occasionally to stretch their muscles or complain matter-of-factly about fatigue . One dancer had found a solution : he lay curled on his side , asleep . Another , munching graham crackers , leaned against Lucy Brown 's upright piano . Patricia Wilde , one of the two leading dancers in the new work , sat on the floor , sewing ribbons onto her toe shoes ; her partner , Jacques d'Amboise , rested alongside her , reading a paper-backed anthology of horror stories . Up front , a member of the company 's corps wondered aloud when she would get a chance to dance a solo role in " The Nutcracker . " Ask Mr. B , was Lucy Brown 's advice . The young dancer was not at all sure that this would work . The pianist would accept no nonsense in the matter ; if the young dancer would n't ask Mr. B , whom would she ask ? Before this suggestion could be given proper thought , Mr. B himself had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he was on time . The napping dancer was awakened ; Mr. B clucked sympathetically . With his back to the vast , darkened auditorium , Mr , B faced his dancers and nervously sniffed the air a few times . Then he called for work by placing two fingers in his mouth and producing a lame parody of a traffic cop 's whistle . One of the dancers wanted to know if it was true that costumes were being designed . " Cos-Entries ? " Mr. B asked in surprise . " Yes , there will be costumes . The boys will he dressed as jockeys . " This set off a minor hubbub ; everyone was pleased . " The girls , " he went on , ' ' will wear some things we already have upstairs . " What about a set ? Mr. B shrugged off the question as though it were the strangest point in the world to raise about a new production . " No sets , " he said . After a moment 's thought , he suddenly brightened and added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some old costumes . " Then Mr. B proceeded to the business at hand . Mr. B , of course , is George Balanchine , a short , compactly muscled , patrician-faced choreographer of fabled reputation who retains the posture and energy of a dancer , which he once was , and the manners and wit of a gentleman born and bred in Tsarist Russia , where , in fact , he grew up as Gheorgi Melitonovich Balantchivadze . The company he is working with is his own , and he serves it under the tide of Artistic Director , a fact which audiences discover only by digging deep into the New York City Ballet 's programs . There they find Balanchinc 's official position listed somewhere around Page 35 in the same type size as the company 's wigmakers , scenery painters , and physician , among others . The audience will not , however , learn anything about Balanchine beyond the correct way to spell his name . This kind of billing ? or lack of it ? is no accident . Over the years , Balanchine has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will stand on his work or nothing at all . To get him to take a bow after the premiere of a new work can be a chore , his dancers say , and once out in front of the New York Cit . Center 's golden curtain he is likely to appear both surprised and bashful . CRAFT , IMAGINATION , GENIUS B ALANC II I N E has been choreographing ballets in almost every theatrical medium for more than three decades , and fellow choreographers and musicians speak of him with profound respect , if not downright awe . Agnes de Mille , for one , has described him as " the greatest craftsman in the profession , and in many ways the most poetic and evocative , " and Jerome Robbins , whose name is probably known to awider public than Balanchine 's , is satisfied to function , in part at least , as Balanchine 's Associate Artistic Director in the company . Composer Morton Could , now at work on a major score for Balanchine , has said , " Balanchine has the capacity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is beyond fashion and the transient elements in art . No matter what he chooses to do , he offers a sense of the truth . This is the gift of genius . " Naturally , there is a certain amount of grumbling to be heard , mainly from abroad , about the exact qualities Balanchine 's " genius " happens to he displaying at any particular moment . The chief complaint is that much of his work seems mechanical and even soulless . Among the charges brought against Balanchine and his company when they visited London for the first time in 1950 was the complete absence of ' ' mystery or sentiment " in everything they danced , while a second critic found a " cold , impersonal quality " in Balanchine 's work that chilled him . Others agreed , and in stronger terms . " He is a diamond with only one facet , " wrote one , " the geometric glitter of abstract ballet . " A French critic later claimed that " George Balanchine seems to be always ready to sacrifice the humanity of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these comments , which attack the very qualities Miss de Mille considers " poetic and evocative , " nettle Balanchine , who , like most men , is not prepared to think of himself as ready to sacrifice the humanity of anything . Apropos of some of the English critics in particular , he has been heard to ask , " Who the hell are they to decide what is poetry and what is n't ? " For Balanchine , who enjoys chewing the American vernacular , the question is pure rhetoric couched in colloquial comfort . It is true , though , that under his direction Balanchine ballerinas rarely assume that expression of secret romantic yearning and perfect unattainability once described as " the faintly constipated look . " They are more likely to appear either totally impassive , tongue-in-cheek , or joyous in action . Nor do they go mad on-stage in the style of a demented Giselle or dance under a pale moon like a Sylphide . Their style is open , free , and extroverted , and their bodies are always lighted so that , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unnatural to them and sentiment embarrassing , in the place of both they offer controlled vigor , a heightened lyricism , and exuberant spirits that are no less attractive to American audiences for sometimes appearing corn-fed . It is just as true that most Balanchine ballets St. Petersburg to New York B ORN in Russia in 1904 , son of a widely-known musician , George Balanchine was admitted to the Imperial School of Ballet in St. Petersburg at the age of tell . He was graduated four years after the Revolution in 1921 , and he set to work choreographing small works in an experimental style . His experiments , however , did n't hold the stage for long . Startlingly different , somewhat brash , and sometimes " erotic , " they brought forth the wrath of Soviet artistic authority , which was just as simple to trigger then as today . Soon afterwards , Balanchine and six friends ? among them Alexandra Danilova and Tamara Geva ? decided it would be wise to set sail from Leningrad for a season 's tour of Western Europe . They billed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonofficial : their mission ? to show the world what Soviet dancing was like ? was pretty much a fake . They had escaped . Balanchine and at least four other members of the group have never returned to Russia . Within a short time . Balanchine found himself in Paris and , at twenty , became ballet master of the Diaghilev company . During his tenure , he choreographed at least two major works that are still being danced today : " Apollo " and " The Prodigal Son . " After Diaghilev 's death , he moved on to other companies , worked in revues and operettas , and in 1935 became choreographer of Les Ballets 1933 . Out of Les Ballets ' single season came " Seven Deadly Sins " to Kurt Weill 's music ( an outstanding success in its recent revival by Balanchine for the New York City Ballet ) and an invitation from Lincoln Kirstein , a brilliant , single-minded young man from Boston , to come to this country and create a native ballet company . With only a little time off for Broadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Balanchine has been associated with Kirstein ever since . While they have shared the responsibility for many projects since 1933 , their most important successes have been the School of American Ballet and the New York City Ballet Company . the latter founded just ten years ago . The school is officially connected with the company , providing rehearsal space when needed , instruction , and , most important , a steady stream of graduates to fill the company 's ranks . This , of course , is Balanchine 's old Imperial School tradition . As for the company itself , under Balanchine 's artistic direction and Kirstein 's administration , it has acquired its own home theater in New York at the City Center of Music and Drama and an ever-increasing audience ? noted for its taste and adventurousness ? whose enthusiastic box-office response has encouraged the company to try a nineteen-week season this year in New York alone . Along with Russia 's Bolshoi and England 's Royal Ballet , it is now considered one of the world 's three most important dance organizations . are " abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matched to the scores Balanchine has chosen to work with , these " abstractions " range from the buckeye humors of " Western Symphony " through the light-hearted disciplines of " Symphony in C , " on to the elegance of " Serenade " and the more formal energy of " Concerto Barocco , " ending finally way to the left ? or far out in front , depending upon one 's affinity for the avant-garde ? with an excursion into outer space called " Agon . " In " Agon , " some feel , Balanchine and Stravinsky , the composer of the piece , have flown straight into the twenty-first century without so much as a backward look at the members of their audience , who , to nearly everyone 's surprise , remain perfectly content to cheer this strange , agitating venture as a marvel at every performance . His work on Broadway during the ' thirties remains an active influence today , although Balanchine himself no longer has much interest in musical comedy , considering himself , at fifty-five , " too old . " More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first danced , its tart , pseudo-tough rhythms , along with its narrative of a gangster and his moll , reappear wearily on the stage and particularly on movie and TV screens . IL is not an unheard-of experience to find actual bits and pieces of its choreography used in another choreographer 's work , with no credits assigned to Balanchine 's original . In a sense , his work in the classic ballet has had the same experience : what were daring Balanchine adventures twenty-five years ago are today 's conventions . Balanchine himself could hardly seem to care less . Clearly , what is important to him is what he is doing now . If it takes twenty-five years for the rest to catch up , let it . ONE , TWO , THREE , FOUR O N-STAGF at the City Center , Mr. B got the rehearsal under way . " All right , " he called . " Let 's do it from the beginning . The whole thing . " " The whole thing , " in this case , meant the introductory bars to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " which Mr. B had already choreographed at a rehearsal several weeks before ; it had not been danced since . Mr. B counted " One , two , three , four , " Lucy Brown began to play the piano , and the dancers made their entrance , counting . They continued to count aloud , a little breathless as they danced . Above the piano came Mr. B 's Russian-accented voice : " One , two , three , four . " At the rear of the stage , the six understudies found room as best they could . They followed the steps tentatively , feeling their way along , shadow-dancing much as boxers shadow-box ; sooner or later , they would all get a chance to dance the work in performance . As Patricia Wilde made her entrance , eluding d'Amboise 's grasp coyly , two of the girls collided head-on and broke into giggles without losing the count . And so it went , with no one , least of all Mr. B , paying any attention to a finished , elegant gesture ; they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon keeping up with the count , which was allegro . Suddenly the music stopped . - Did it come out ? " Lucy Brown asked , looking up . Her answer stared her in the face , for the dancers had ended on her beat , precisely . Mr. B was pleased . Mildly , he asked her for a repeat , and then another . The work continued like this for another seventy minutes or so , when the company 's union representative called for a five-minute recess . While the dancers broke , Mr. B reviewed the score at the piano . " I just want to make sure , " he said , putting on his glasses . " I never believe my ear . It always gives me the melody but sometimes forgets the rhythm . " When the five minutes were up , Mr. B headed back to the front of the stage . Calling for the six couples , he announced that he would start work on the third movement . Patricia Wilde went hack to her sewing , d'Amboise to his book . Slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening bars , showing each member of the six couples what he was supposed to do . " One , two , three , four . One , two , three , four , " he said , rising on the ball of his left foot and turning . " You go on this leg . " He came down hard ; his movements were neither graceful nor clumsy , merely trained . Bcat by beat , his dancers followed , counting aloud , trying what Mr. B had demonstrated almost before he had finished demonstrating it . At one point , he stopped to try a movement alone ; shuffling warily , he looked like a blind man testing for obstacles in his path . " Boys , " he decided , " you go around , one , two , three , four . " He showed them , taking one of the girls by the waist . Step by step , the work continued . At the end of fifteen minutes Mr. B had choreographed perhaps thirty seconds of the third movement , and the dancers had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he let the group dance the whole thirty-second sequence without a stop , slowly to the count . Then they did it again . At last , Mr. B nodded to Lucy Brown and the six couples repeated the passage to the music played in the correct tempo . A knot was discovered ; somehow , one of the couples had found itself with an extra beat . Mr. B had them count and dance slowly , the piano silent . The extra beat was found and thrown away and the group repeated the passage once again : " One , two , three , four . " Where would they be without simple arithmetic ? " Lost , " Mr. B said , " outside the music . " ARE YOU COMFORTABLE ? 1V1 I D W A Y through rehearsal the follow- ing evening , it became clear that the movements Mr. B had devised so far for Patricia Wilde and the six girls were meant to suggest those of skittish colts , whom d'Amboise and the boys were out to capture and tame . At no point had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps revealed the whole story . By this time , he had divided the six couples into two equal groups , each with its own set of entrance and exit cues . He wanted to see one short passage repeated " Will the first couple of the second group and the second couple of the first group come in on the second beat of the second couple of the first group ? " he asked blandly . The dancers looked at each other , bewildered . " My God , " one whispered to her partner , " you 've got to be a calculus major to figure this out . " Mr. B was unperturbed . " Like Abraham Lincoln said , " he went on , " you can fool all the first people the second time and all the second people the first time and . . . " The dancers interrupted with laughter . While Mr. B called for work with the soloists , the six couples took a break . Several went out for a cigarette ; they do their smoking out of sight of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-righteously needling those who remain unredeemed . Others began to practice at the rear of the stage , reviewing material with their understudies . The Marzipan problem came up again ; the girl who wanted to dance the role in " The Nutcracker " was still concerned about how to go about asking for it . This time , though , Lucy Brown had no time for her . She was busy waiting for cues from Mr. B and the soloists . Mr. B was describing a new step to d'Amboise , his directions thick with the French words that help to form the classic ballet vocabulary : coupe , briae , Unbound , tour en Parr . Mr. B tried the step ; it did n't look very good . Watching him , d'Amboise seemed doubtful . Finally he tried it himself , turning fast in the air , making consecutive landings on one foot as he moved diagonally down the stage . His alternate , Edward Villella , followed right behind him . It worked for both , and the company applauded . " Are you comfortable about doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait to try it again . An hour later , he returned to the six couples and the Rieti symphony 's third movement . " Noch einmal , " he said . " Vom Eingang . " Mt . B cued Lucy Brown . " Vom where ? " one of the girls whispered . The group began to dance the movement 's opening measures , the piano setting the pace . Mr. B clapped his hands to the beat , presto . " That 's right ! " he called as the dancers rushed on , counting under their breaths . Suddenly one of the girls began to cry for help ; she was hopelessly tangled in her partner 's arms . Dodging them , the remaining five couples finished out the sequence . " Not bad , " Mr. B commented . " Now all together . Again . " CALLUSES AND HULA HOOPS W I T H two weeks to go before the premiere of " Rieti , " Mr. B had the choreography for the first movement and part of the third ? the finale ? completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was to be a long as de deux for Wilde and d'Amboise . As he continued to create steps for the six couples in the finale , he began to add , for the first time , suggestions on how to attack phrases . At one point , he showed the girls exactly how he wanted them to move . " Do n't run timid , " he said , imitating their mincing gait . " Run . " Later , to a dancer who was beginning to show signs of aping Eddie Arcaro , he said , " Do n't act ? dance . " Another night , rehearsal was interrupted by out-of-town guests who wanted to say good-by , get some autographs , and take a few snapshots of Mr. B. " I 'm not so pretty , " Mr. B protested amiably . He struck a pose , hand on hip , chin up , aristocratic nose proudly twitching . " This , " he joked , " is known as a Batista complex . " As soon as the guests had left , he picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the interruption . An hour later , the question arose as to just how much new material he had choreographed that night . Lucy Brown counted it out for him on the score . " Twenty-two bars ? " lie said . " It 's not much . It 's not little . Not satisfying . Yet sufficient . " The finale was completed nine days before the opening , and Mr. B had the cast run through it from beginning to end three times . " It 's busy , " he filially decided . " But it will be freer . " Fatigue and nerves were beginning to show on the dancers . Some worried aloud about keeping the count on opening night ; they were afraid the audience would see their lips moving . Others had developed midwinter colds and spent much of the time wearily passing Kleenex boxes among themselves . There was foot trouble too ; corns , calluses , and ingrown toenails were under steady treatment . At the end of the three-hour session , one dancer slumped to the floor , head between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " You think you can keep on working forever without getting tired . " Like the rest of the company , he had about an hour 's time in which to eat and get ready for the evening 's performance . Finally , Mr. B got down to work on the ballet 's middle section , the pas de deux ; in it , Wilde and d'Amboise were to he supported by the six jockeys . Mr. B began by handing out three hula hoops and showing the buys how and where to hold them so that Wilde could be lifted through by d'Amboise . First they did it one hoop at a time . The effect was of a thoroughbred horse jumping in slow motion . Then Mr. B arranged the hoops in combinations of twos and threes , until at last an intricate set of tricky variations had been worked out . The dancers were grim and on edge ; one hoop an inch too high , or low , and Wilde could suffer a nasty fall . D'Amboise encouraged his partner patiently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , passing her through one hoop and into another . " Take our time . Take our time . " The hoops were not coming together the way Mr. B wanted . He stopped the pianist and the dancers . It should look like that thing on television , " he explained . " Like that Bromo Seltzer ad or something . " " Right , " one of the boys answered , " purity , body and flavor , " and the three hoops immediately interlocked in the Ballantine beer pattern . A few minutes later the girls ' costumes arrived . Calling a break , Mr. B had Miss Wilde try hers on ; it turned out to he wrong in every way . Quietly , Mr. B ticked off answers to questions of color , fabric , fit , and cut , emphasizing that he did not want the whiteness of d'Amhoise 's tights to dominate the stage . This reminded him that he wanted the girls to wear pony-tails on their hair opening night . Would someone see to it that they had headbands made of tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit . Forgetting the hoops , Mr. B continued with the two soloists , setting the opening of the pas de deux . As they repeated each newly learned phrase ? once , twice , five times ? Wilde and d'Amboise hummed the long , romantic melodic line . Lucy Brown watched from the piano , her hands in her lap . " It 's very beautiful , " she admitted , " but I do n't know where any of it goes . " Mr. B stopped his dancers and whistled the melody for them ; then he traced it silently upon the air with his forefinger . Finally he checked the score . There was a problem . Wilde and d'Amboise were snagged in the middle of a difficult step in which , supported on one arm by d'Amboise , the ballerina was to leap , twist in mid-air to face the opposite direction , and return to earth becalmed and serene on one leg . The question was precisely when to twist in mid-air . Mr. B offered to try it with Wilde . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll hurt your back . " He took her arm . " Let 's go , " he said . They tried it together , Mr. B explaining the timing as they moved ; it worked . The two soloists took it up again . It worked , it did n't work , it almost worked . . Just before the end of the rehearsal , Mr. B remembered that lie had something to tell them all . He had a title for the ballet . It would be advertised in the papers the following day as " Native Dancers . " It was then one week to opening night . * " Native Dancers " ? whose title is taken from the name of a great American race horse ? is being produced again this season at the City Center . The ballet was finally complete ; rehearsals in the conventional sense could begin . Unlike the actor , who can memorize his lines in private ; the dancer memorizes and creates simultaneously ; he is both script and performer and there is no alternative . Although a system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been " scored " on paper during its creation . If Mr. B and his dancers had vanished before opening night , the new ballet would have vanished with them . Two days before the premiere , there was a sudden upset . One of the six girls had to withdraw from the cast because of illness . She was replaced by an understudy with whom Mr. B worked alone for two hours on details . SNEAK PREVIEW FOR THE ANGELS A SP E C I AL audience of several hundred attended a run-through of the new work the day before the premiere . Most were invited as patrons of the City Center ; their annual contributions to the theater give them the right to attend all previews . Upstairs , visiting students from Columbia University partially filled the balcony . While they waited , Mr. B offered to some of the girls backstage a little critique of Russia 's Beryozka Dance Troupe , which was then performing in New York . " Such precision , " he said , waving his hands enthusiastically . " So nice . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ticket and go . " He went on to tell his dancers that the Beryozka girls averaged only sixteen years . " Such little things . You know , they are all married and have one child already . " His girls looked at him in dismay . " No , no , " lie said . " Do n't misunderstand me . That is why they are allowed to leave Russia . They are sure to go back . " Jockey shoes for the boys arrived and a pair was handed to Mr. B. He examined the soles , flexed the insteps , peered inside , and finally slammed the shoes down on a table . ' This is a foot ? " he demanded of the shoes . He asked one of the boys to try his pair on ; the shoes were loose in the wrong spots and tight in the others . " This is what they send us ? " Mr. B asked , pointing at the dancer 's feet . Someone suggested that the shoes would be all right once they were broken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can make an atomic bomb . Why ca n't we make shoes ? " " He 's getting nervous for us , " Miss Wilde said . " He always worries about his dancers . " The scene reminded her of the time , years before , when Balanchine had choreographed " Concerto Barocco " for another company . " Before Mr. B agreed to do it , " she said , " he stipulated that all the dancers , including the corps , had to have new shoes for every performance . And he made the management pay for them , too . There 's more dancing in one Balanchine ballet than in any twelve others put together . " Almost everything that could confirm the ancient theatrical tradition of pre-opening-night disaster happened on-stage at the City Center in the quarter-hour that followed . Almost before the ballet was a minute under way , the orchestra and dancers were half a beat apart , and the distance between them was steadily growing . As the performance continued , there were frequent memory lapses that left some of the dancers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simple steps were crudely executed , difficult ones slurred . The newly rehearsed alternate made an entrance propelled by enthusiasm , anxiety , and tension and landed flat on her back ; she was up in a second , horrified . During the pas de deux . Patricia Wilde 's foot was repeatedly tripped by the hula hoops , and at one point it was even money whether she and d'Amboise would be able to extricate themselves from the Ballantine beer pattern . At the finale , everyone was visibly counting and out of breath , each going his or her own way , intent only upon getting through to the final exit . One girl came off with her face hurled in her hands . " That 's the end of me as a Balanchine dancer , " she moaned . Another was angry . " It 's bad , had , " she cried .. " Mr. B must be dying . " At that moment , Mr. B was heading backstage after some politely tepid applause from the audience , which was settling back to see what might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " You are all too relaxed . Dig in . This is a stamping-piece . " He asked them to repeat the finale with the orchestra ; as they danced , he counted aloud for them , clapping his hands . He had them do it again . " When you go around , go around . " To one dancer , he said , " Do n't try to out-blast the trumpet " ; to another , " Not too much force . Just clear . " Mr. B gave the beat , carrying the rhythm along ; he clapped his hands , slapped his thighs ; everyone watched him for cues . A pair of horn-rimmed glasses went flying across the stage from the momentum of a dancer 's movement . " Up , up , up , " Mr. B called to the cast . ' ' Not the legs , the body . Up ? " Mr. B worked with individuals , couples , groups of six , the entire cast . " Mr. B , " Lucy Brown said , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is flourishing . " After two-and-a-half hours of unbroken work , Mr. B called a recess . The City Center patrons and the students from Columbia applauded him . He was surprised to discover that they were still in the auditorium . " Let 's get the curtain down , " he said . " Enough is enough . " Hours later , Mr. B thanked his cast . " It 's almost ready , I think , " he said . Then , as the dancers headed for their dressing-rooms , he turned to no one in particular and offered an opinion in a barely audible voice , as though he had to get the words out into the open air , stated if unheard . " I do n't think we can have much more improvement , " he said . " The thing is not so good anyway . " EASY FINISH N ATIVE DANCERS " went on the next night , with a simple set that had been held back almost until the last minute as a surprise for Mr. B. The opening-night audience gave it an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up intermission with its bravos . In his review the next morning , John Martin of the New York Times seemed to agree in part with Balanchine 's own opinion . " Out of Balanchine 's second drawer , " he wrote , nevertheless adding that the new work offered " wit and invention " and a pas de deux that was " quite wonderful . " Walter Terry of the Herald Tribune felt considerably better about the whole thing . Among other things , he described the ballet as being filled with " a fantastic array of choreographic challenges " and " spectacular movements " ; all in all , he felt that the company had danced like " champions " and that " Native Dancers " was " a delight . " All the other papers agreed . The Post thought it " daring and tinged with the unexpected " and shared Mr. Martin 's feelings about the hula-hoop pas de deux , which it found " stunning . " The News , colloquial as ever , headlined its review " Native Dancers in Easy Finish " and called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a choreographer who " can do almost anything with any piece of music . " As for Mr. B , he finally took a single curtain call alongside his two soloists . Standing on the apron of the stage as he bowed , he could be seen smiling at Vittorio Rieti , who was seated in the orchestra . Still smiling , Mr. B offered him a shy , schoolboy 's wave that started a surge of applause in the direction of the composer , and , as it built , quickly retired behind the curtain .
