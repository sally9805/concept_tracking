Has the artist any obligation to weigh human values or to communicate through his art a vision of spiritual truth ? <P> <P> That simple question , to which almost any layman would answer yes , gets a fast and furious no from many of today 's esthetes . Even to ask it in arty circles is to sound like a hick or a troublemaker . Selden Rodman , who is neither , uses it to kick off one of the most provocative art books in years ( The Eye of Man ; Devin-Adair ; $10 ) . His own **26;14582;TOOLONG the lattices of a hundred ivory towers . <P> Rodman 's thesis , in brief , is that modern art has turned its back on content , and therefore on the public-and that it 's a great pity . " Content " Rodman defines as " a projection through tangible symbols of the artist 's attachment to values out side art itself . " To draw the shutters on all values except formal ones , and paint pictures of nothing at all , demeans art to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demeaned , right and left . <P> Critics who deplore this trend and hope for better things are often laughed at . Laughter , in turn , can make for bitter or even bigoted criticism . Rodman , aware of the danger , does not hesitate to belabor some people in his own party . Among others , Rodman sideswipes A. &; P. Heir Huntington Hartford , who last summer took full-page ads in six Manhattan dailies to exhort against modern art and supine art critics ( TIME , June 20 ) . Hartford , he complains , " was asking that art define truth rather than express it-and then defining it himself in the narrowest terms . . . To demand of art a specific ' moral answer ' is just as unreasonable as to insist , as some formalist critics do , that the artist have no morals at all , that he create in a vacuum . " <P> The main contribution of The Eye of <P> Man lies not in such blameless refereeing but in Rodman 's heartfelt reinterpretation of art history , past and present . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art has always been two-faced . Giotto knew how to make the two faces-form and content-merge into one . So did Rembrandt and every other great painter . But artists who try to get around the problem by sacrificing form to content ( like the academicians ) or content to form ( like the most extreme of the moderns ) have always fallen flat between the two . <P> <P> To profile the two faces . Rodman organized a loan exhibition at Manhattan 's Gallery G last week . One side of the gallery was devoted to pictures emphasizing form , and the other side to those in which content came first . Leaning over backward to be fair , he made abstractions the show 's better half . Actually his thesis was better illustrated by other works currently showing . Items :
