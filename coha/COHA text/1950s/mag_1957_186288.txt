Prosperity , the Washington experts were finding out last week , is something like a wife . If you tell her she is beautiful , she glows . But if you tell her that she should pat here and retract there to keep her beauty enduring , she breaks into tears , convinced that she is sagging all over . <P> Treasury Secretary George Magoffin Humphrey , for example , has some pretty strait-laced ideas about balanced figures . Testifying last week before a crowded session of the Joint Congressional Committee on the President 's Economic Report . Humphrey warned : " If we retain our present high tax rates over a sufficiently long period of time , we wo n't be able to maintain the activities necessary to provide jobs for our people . " But he turned down committee invitations to suggest ways of trimming President Eisenhower 's $71.8 billion fiscal-1958 budget ( TIME , Jan. 28 ) . Urged Wyoming 's Democratic Senator Joseph O'Mahoney , pointing to a display of budget charts on an easel : " Take your scissors right now and point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit wistfully , Humphrey replied : " If I knew , I would have done so long ago . " <P> The Road to Inflation . When Humphrey had finished , Federal Reserve Board Chairman William McChesney Martin Jr . took the stand , and without even noting that Prosperity was beautiful , grimly defended the Administration 's " tight money " policy as an indispensable weapon against inflation . With the economy booming , he explained again , demand for credit tends to outrun supply , so interest rates push upward . For the Government to try to hold the rates down would be to follow " the road to inflation . " The oft-raised claim that tight money presses unfairly on small business and local government is " debatable , " Martin argued . Furthermore , frustrated borrowers " would suffer infinitely more from further inflationary bites " than they do from temporary postponement of borrowing . In fact , said Martin , if he had it all to do over again he would have laced up bank credit even tighter , beginning back in late 1954 , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hint of relenting : " The balance between savings and investment can change completely in three to four months ' time . " <P> There was nothing to alarm anybody in Martin 's testimony , taken by itself ; like Humphrey he was just suggesting that it was time to think about the future . But at a Washington dinner given by the Citizens ' Committee for the Hoover Report came a candid , grandfatherly rumble from a man whose very name has been used by Democrats for years to frighten Prosperity 's babies . Warned ex-President Herbert Hoover : " Secretary Humphrey says that unless we change some of our ways , we will see ' a depression that will curl your hair . ' Mine has already been curled once , and I think I can detect the signs . . . Unless we curb inflation on its way up , Old Man Economic Law will return with a full equipment of hair curlers . " <P> <P> That did it . Next day stock prices sagged ( see BUSINESS ) .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
