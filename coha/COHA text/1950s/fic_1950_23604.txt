 - -  Look out ! " I felt a violent push . In the same instant something zipped past my head and crashed against the car behind . " My God ! Went right at you ! " gasped the agent . It had shattered a window of the car and gone through the open door opposite . Wefound it in the road beyond , sizzling on the Tarmac . A heavy steel nut , white-hot . " I do n't know about you , " the estate agent said , " but I 'm rather in favor of getting out of here . " And we did . Quickly . Curphey 's Follower T BEGAN one night in the gradual quietness that follows closing-time . Lot Cur- phey was on his way home from Ballaroddan village , not quite solid on his feet , and with little crumbs of song still coming out of his mouth ; too cheerful to swear at the faintness of the starlight . He was a small man , chiefly from shortness of the legs , with a tufty hairiness about the face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him by John James Quilleash , his employer . Under its long skirts his left leg limped from an injury by a plowshare years before ; now and then the thick cloth dipped in the dust . About half a mile from his cottage he was chilled by the night air and beginning to notice things . He felt that he was being followed . He stopped and turned . There was sound but a sheep 's cough far away on right . He scraped his foot sharply in loose surface . A few yards away something slithered . Curphey could see a black patch against the lighter darkness of the road . Too small for a dog . - " Shoo , cat ! " he said loudly . For a second his back tingled at the odd stillness of it . Possible horrors bobbed in his mind . He stamped towards it with a hollow-feeling foot . The thing moved ; and as it moved , it flapped . And spoke unmistakahly . " Quaal " That was how Lot Curphey met the duck . It followed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along behind at a respectful number of small paces . Twice he tried to chase it home , taking it to be a stray from the yard of old Skillicorn , who was unpleasantly litigious . Each time it scuttled close again as soon as he turned his back . He came to the cottage where he lived alone , and went straight in and lit the oil lamp . An eye glittered in the flare , low down on the threshold . He stooped , lamp in hand , and the duck grew clear . The creature was amazingly ugly . It stood on the rough slate step boldly , but with its right leg oddly twisted , like a bored corner boy . One eye looked in his face ; the other was closed and hollow . Its feathers lay many ways ; in patches there were none . Those that remained were a shiny black . After a moment he picked it up , careful about where he touched it , and it was quiet in his hands . Thin , with skin loose in his fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg was old , and no treatment needed . And it was too skinny to eat . I N TILE half-light of the next morning , Curphey found the black duck among the seedlings in his front garden patch . He shouted and flung his hat at it . Having to clamber sleepily after his hat , he trod on three Brussels sprouts . He swore , loud in the clammy air , tried to restore them , and swore again ; threw a handful of gravel at the duck with seeming effect , and set off up the side path that pointed to Quilleash 's farm . The duck came behind , running crookedly . It trailed him as determinedly as in the darkness , using its wings when the man gained . Curphey came into the farm street hurriedly , ready to be embarrassed , with a glance behind and a nervous dab at his hat . At his limping heel scrambled the duck . It ignored the other birds that watched curiously from the midden . " It 's taken a fancy to me , " said Curphey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable when their laughter turned safely on to the duck . " Mus ' think I 'm a  --  a charity for oul ' twisty ducks ! " That day it followed him everywhere . When he went on the plow , a black head bobbed down the furrows a couple of yards behind , puzzling the hovering gulls and crows . He was uneasy . His mind ran vaguely on catnip and aniseed , and once , feeling uncomfortably traitorous to Quilleash , on the properties of his yellow coat ; he stood , in a quiet moment , among the farmer 's fat , preening Aylesburys to try its effect on them . But they seemed immune . During the break he gave the creature a half bun that had fallen in a puddle . At dinner-time it waited outside the kitchen door , menaced by a striped cat . It accompanied him to the stables and pigsties , and was chased by a dog as ragged as itself . And in due time it trailed Curphey home . By the end of the second day he had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had also been made familiar , to the point of exasperation , with the habits of Mary 's Little Lamb . People would come to cottage doors as they passed , grinning slowly . He discovered small audiences at crossroads . Boys sniggered on the hedges . A carter reined in his horse and raised his hat ironically as the ugly bird twitched along the roadside . Some were alarmed : an old woman pulled a shawl over her head , and hid in a field clutching a charm-herb , till they passed ; a pair of small girls on a garden patch were pulled suddenly indoors . Dogs barked . Nobody claimed the duck . Lot Curphey found a habit of waving his yellow-coated arm broadly , with a certain fluttering of the fingers and jerk of the thumb ; meant to convey a bright humor , rich with enjoyment of the situation , and the duck as a witless butt . A new , exciting self-consciousness ran through him . His limping foot felt as if it danced . N THE evening of the fourth day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was timid among the houses , and used its wings to keep a safer , crooked course ; but never far behind . At the door he stopped , winking and waving to the sunlit loungers . He stooped over the bird , picked it up , and went into the pub with a conscious air of making an entrance . Inside , he stood , duck in hand . The place was bright , with smoke deadening the mellow beeriness . The bar had half a dozen round it . One turned , wiping his frothy mustache pleasurably . " Well , it 's himself ! An ' will ye look what 's at him ! " They swung round . Big Moughtin the smith prodded a too-absorbed drinker . " Take y'r face out o ' that ! The man 's brought his duck ! " Curphey approached , pleased . " Is that the one they 're all on about ? " Kermit Kermode , behind the bar , drew Curphey a pint on the house and screwed up his eyes . " It 's an ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg or what ? Come on , stick it down here an ' let 's have a sight . " And the duck stood among the wet rings left by glasses , leaning on its crooked leg , the one eye fixed on Lot Curphey . " I had a book of ducks ' illnesses , " said little red-faced Quirk , looking round the bar . " By the look of it , she has n't left many out , eh ? " " Who are you , insultin ' me prize bird ! " said Curphey . Amused , they treated him to a second pint , then another , and he warmed inside the yellow coat . The room grew still brighter . The others watched him , letting their interest ripen . " Did ye train her up , " said big Moughtin , " to follow ye ? In the place of a dog , like ? " " Hardly at all , " said Curphey , and winked . The power o ' the human eye , it was . Me havin ' two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage . " He stretched out a hand and chucked the bird 's black bill . It scarcely moved . " Aw , its the funniest thing y ' ever seen , " he said , " when it gets goin ' . " He giggled . He put the duck on the floor and let it follow him round the room , jerking among the iron table legs , past the spittoon . Moughtin began to laugh , slowly at first , then deeperand more painfully , without stopping . Round and round they went , Curphey twisting and dodging , and urging the duck on . He was beginning to enjoy the act . In a tiny , false voice lie called , " Come on , then ! Who 's an ugly funny bird , then ? Come to daddy an ' have y'r oul ' neck screwed ! Where 's the pie-dish , then ? " He began to pull faces . Quirk gave little amused barks . Moughtin was shaking . Curphey went faster , glass in hand . He pretended anger at the duck 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have no effect . " Put a move on ! Ye one-eyed insect ! Left , right , left , right ! Do n't ye know which is y'r left ? Me handsome man-eater disgracin ' me ! " Moughtin had tried to drink , and was being thumped on the back . " Halt ! " Curphey thrust his head out at the duck . It stared at him without expression . " What are ye lookin ' at me that way for ? Eli ? O-o-oh , I see ! Well , I 'm sorry , but I ca n't do it . Ye see "  - -  a stage whisper ? " y 're not realty strong enough to be killed . An ' I have n't the time just at the present , though I 'm sorry to disappoint ye ! " He turned to the bar , and from his pocket brought a handful of ripe corn , rattling on the varnished wood . ? " Will ye dip some o ' this in a drop o ' gin , Kermit ? " Big Moughtin , grasping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced among the glasses . In front of it was the doctored corn . Curphey offered a few grains in his hand . After a moment 's hesitation , they went quickly . " Aw , she 's used to it ! " said somebody . The duck was nuzzling after the grains among the slopped beer . " A bit more , Kermit ! An ' I 'll have another pint meself . " They placed the duck on the floor again . It waddled a few steps after Curphey , then staggered on its sound foot . There was a howl of delight . " Whassa marrer ? " Curphey shouted at it , with a sham hiccup . " You shay I wash drunk ? " The duck 's bill opened and shut . Its eye blinked . One wing drooped . A gray foot groped , slipped back to safety . It could not walk . Curphey grabbed it by the neck and swept it high . " By yer leave , Kermit ! " he giggled , and stuck its head into his own beer mug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They clustered round to watch , laughing . Two or three fresh customers stood in puzzlement . " Drinks f'r both of them on me , Kermit ! " shouted Moughtin . " The bird can down it like a right fella ! " For the rest of the evening , Lot Curphey tormented his duck . It was soon helplessly drunk . Set on the bar counter , it could only gaze into his eyes with a lovelorn fixity , while its head swayed and its legs slid . For a long time he addressed it in mono-logues , pretending sometimes to listen and to receive offensive answers . " What did you say ? Did you say that ? Ye wicked ungrateful creature , I wonder ye can look me in tit ' eye ! Stand up straight when ye speak to y'r elders , will ye ! Now , as I was sayin ' , strung drink is detrimental to the soul an ' the linin ' of the gizzard --  " They treated him again and again , keeping him going . " Ye sorry fowl ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can read ye like a hook . Ye want me to learn y ' how to swim . " More laughter . " So I will , so I will , have no fear ! Ask , and it shall be given unto --  Wait a minute , though ! " A doubtful scratch at his chin . " Ye might drown ! " The audience responded . Curphey frowned at the ceiling through the bottom of his glass . He swung round with a secret whisper . " I 'll tell ye what ! Did n't y'r mothers once tell ye about th ' Ugly Duckling ? " A nod at the dozing duck . " This must he himself ! He 's passed the time to change into a swan an ' he wants help  --  forgotten how to do it ! Here , give me strength , Kermit . Fill up ! " Gradually the sense went out of his talk . " Aw , y'vc had enough , " said Kermode at last , " or ye 'll never get home tonight man . " " Li'l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now  --  listen , li'l duck --  " " Ye 'd better take y'r clever duck away now , Lot ! " said Kermode loudly in his ear . " Let her sleep it off . It 's hard on closin ' time . " The comedian brought him into focus . " I will , Kermit , I will . " He picked up the cluck and buttoned it inside his coat . Once again , Moughtin began to laugh , wheezily now , at the two heads looking muzzily out of the yellow coat . " ' Night , boys ! " said Curphey , and moved unsteadily towards the door . It was then that big Moughtin did a tactless thing . He named the cause of all their laughter . " Look at it ! " he said . " The thing is ; he he 's the bloody spittin ' image o ' the duck ! " And wheezed enormously . His own joke pleased him most of any during the evening . Curphey stopped , suddenly quiet . There came a stillness in every part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the bar . His lips made a movement , then closed . He turned , and went from the pub , leaving the door swinging . His steps were quick and unsteady in the darkness . He went faster , hot-faced and limping . In a few minutes he was above the village . His breath came tightly . Against his chest he felt the warmth of the duck . Curphey stopped , dragged it savagely from his coat . Its bill gave a little guttural sound . " By God ! " said Curphey . He shook it . In a sudden fury he flung it from him . Its wings opened before it hit the road , and it fluttered crazily in the darkness . He raised his foot to kick . It dodged drunkenly . He began to chase it . First in clumsy , set rushes , then snatching here and there ; tripping over the heavy wings of his coat , swearing and growling . He could not see it , and listened fur its pattering . Once he trod on it , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonlight they came to where the hedge was low . In a frenzy , the duck scrambled aside over ditch and hedge , into rough open turf . Curphey splashed after it , clawing fiercely . He could see it in the dimness , exhausted . As he sprang , his foot gave under him . With a great smacking squelch , he fell flat on his face . He lay quietly on the boggy earth . The bird crouched , still , in a patch of reeds , until the tiny bubbling and sucking noises ceased . The moon rose higher , and whitened the stone that had stunned him . His face lay in a puddle of brown mountain water , so shallow that it barely covered his nostrils . W HEN he did not appear for work next day , Quilleash sent to his cottage and Found it locked . Seaching down the road to the village , they sighted his boots among the rushes not far away on the other side of the hedge . They turned him over , and were shocked , and curious at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'll have to be , " said one . Presently he was wrapped in two gray blankets and carried to the road . A hand-cart waited to take him down to the village . It set off , soaked blankets flapping heavily in the smart spring wind . A short distance down the road ahead , something moved at the ditch 's edge . " There it is ! " said a man . The duck looked up as they came near ; leaning sideways . Its black eye ignored the cart and stared past , up the empty road . When they were far down the hill , one glanced back . A tiny shape , the duck was still standing there . Its head seemed to jerk from side to side , looking for something . The day after the inquest , it was stabbed with a long-handled pitchfork , by the son of the old woman who gathered charm-herbs . He wore a bunch round his neck .                    @
