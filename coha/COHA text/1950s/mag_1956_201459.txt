As the two major TV networks , NBC and CBS are locked in a permanent war for talent , ideas , advertisers and listeners . This season one of the war 's major campaigns is the battle of Sunday night at 8 ( TIME , Oct. 17 , 1955 ) . Thus far , CBS has won . With the Ed Sullivan Show consistently rated one of TV 's top two most popular shows , CBS has had little trouble with NBC 's mediocre Comedy Hour . Last week NBC announced its newest strategy . Beginning June 24 , it is throwing Comedian Steve ( Tonight ) Allen , 34 , into the Sunday night breach . <P> Said NBC Chairman of the Board Sylvester L. ( " Pat " ) Weaver : " Some people ask us , ' Why do n't you try to beat Sullivan with drama , something other than comedy ? ' We 've really looked into it , statistically and every other way , and everything we 've learned shows that on Sundays from 8 to 9 we get largely family audiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will tune in on comedy . So we are going to give them what we think they want-a souped-up , slicked-down version of Tonight . " <P> To show that Weaver meant business , NBC last week put the Bob Hope Spectacular , with Allen as narrator , against Sullivan . Said Allen : " I do n't want anyone to think I 'm rushing in with my sleeves rolled up to beat Ed Sullivan . It 's a free country , and there 's plenty of room in it for both of us . " <P> <P> At week 's end , it was not plain that Sullivan agreed . To discourage viewers from looking at Allen 's opening show this Sunday , Sullivan , no man to stand still while being shot at , was celebrating his show 's eighth anniversary with a dazzling array of 43 guests , most of them from Hollywood .
