If it 's too impossibly difficult to track down and recapture an escaped criminal ... there 's a worse thing one might do .... Illustration JULY 18 , 1949 A.D. The fugitive lay face down in the fetid undergrowth , drawing in spasmodic lungfuls of air through cracked and swollen lips . Long before , his blue workshirt had been ripped to ribbons and his exposed chest showed a spiderwork of scratches , where branches and brambles had sought to restrain him in his frenzied flight . Across his back from shoulder to shoulder ran a deeper cut around which the caked blood attested to the needle-sharp viciousness of a thorn bush a mile to the north . With each tortured breath he winced , as drops of sweat ran down , following the spiderwork network and burning like acid . Incessantly he rubbed his bruised torso with mud-caked palms to dislodge the gnats and mosquitoes that clung to him , gorging shamelessly . To the east he could see the lights of Fort Mudge where the railroad cut through on its way to Jacksonville . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were stopping every train and searching along every foot of the railroad right of way . In the distance he heard the eerie keen of a train whistle , and visualized the scene as it was flagged down and searched from engine to caboose . Directly before him loomed the forbidding northern boundary of the Okefenokee Swamp . Unconsciously he strained his ears , then shuddered at the night noises that issued from the noisome wilderness . A frenzied threshing , then a splash , then ... silence . What drama of life and death was being played out in that strange other-world of perpetual shadows ? In sudden panic he jerked erect and cupped his palm round his ear . Far off ; muted by distance , but still unmistakable ; he heard the baying of bloodhounds . Then this was the end . A sob broke from his throat . What was he , an animal ; to be hunted down as a sport ? Tears of self-pity welled to his eyes as he thought back to a party and a girl and laughter and cleanliness and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was so long ago  --  so long ago  --  and now .... He looked down at his sweating , lacerated body ; his blistered calloused palms ; the black broken nails ; the cheap workshoes with hemp laces ; the shapeless gray cotton trousers , now wet to the knees . He pulled back his shoulders and resolutely faced west toward the river , but stopped short in horror as he heard the sudden cacophony of barks , yelps and howls of a pack of bloodhounds that senses the beginning of the end . He turned in panic . They could n't be over half a mile away . In a panic of indecision he turned first east then west , then facing due south he hesitated a moment to take one last look at the clear open skies , and with a muffled prayer plunged into the brooding depths of the Okefenokee. * * * * * JUNE 13 , 427th Year GALACTIC ERA The building still hummed and vibrated with the dying echoes of the alarm siren as the biophysicist hurried down the corridor , and without breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . The Director shuffled the papers before him and sighed heavily . His chair creaked protestingly as he shifted his bulk and looked up . " Well ? " " He got away clean , " said the biophysicist . " Any fix on the direction ? " " None at all , sir . And he 's got at least a two hours ' start . That takes in a pretty big area of space . " " Hm-m-m ! Well there 's just a bare chance . That experimental cruiser is the fastest thing in space and it 's equipped with the latest ethero-radar . If we get started right away , we just might  --  " " That 's just it , " interrupted the biophysicist . " That 's the ship he got away in . " The Director jumped angrily to his feet . " How did that happen ? How can I explain to the board ? " " I 'm sorry , sir . He was just too  --  " " You 're sorry ? " He slumped back in his chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower lip with his teeth . He exhaled loudly and leaned forward . " Well , only one thing to do . You know the orders . " The biophysicist squirmed uncomfortably . " Could n't we send a squadron of ships out to search and  --  " " And what ? " asked the Director , sarcastically . " You do n't think I 'd risk a billion credits worth of equipment on a wild-goose chase like that , do you ? We could use up a year 's appropriation of fuel and manpower and still be unable to adequately search a sector one-tenth that size . If he just sat still , a thousand ships could n't find him in a thousand years , searching at finite speeds . Add to that the fact that the target is moving at ultra-light speed and the odds against locating him is multiplied by a billion . " " I know , but he ca n't stay in space . He 'll have to land somewhere , sometime . " " True enough  --  but where and when ? " " Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know better than that . He could be halfway across the galaxy before an ethero-gram reached the nearest planet . " " Suppose we sent scout ships to the nearer planets and asked them to inform their neighbors in the same way . We 'd soon have an expanding circle that he could n't slip through . " The Director smiled wryly . " Maybe . But who 's going to pay for all this . By the time the circle was a thousand light-years in diameter there would be ten thousand ships and a million clerks working on recapturing one escaped prisoner . Another thing ; I do n't know offhand what he 's been sentenced for , but I 'll wager there are ten thousand planets on which his crime would not be a crime . Do you think we could ever extradite him from such a planet ? And even if by some incredible stroke of fortune one of our agents happened to land on the right planet , in which city would he begin his search . Or suppose our quarry lands only on uninhabited planets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the search for just one man . " " I know , but  --  " " But what ? " interrupted the Director . " Any other suggestions ? " " N ... no  --  " " All right , he asked for it . You have the pattern , I presume . Feed it to Fido ! " " Yes , sir , but well ... I just do n't  --  " " Do you think I like it ? " asked the Director , fiercely . In the silence that followed , they looked at each other , guiltily . " There 's nothing else we can do , " said the Director . " The orders are explicit . No one escapes from Hades ! " " I know , " replied the biophysicist . " I 'm not blaming you . Only I wish someone else had my job . " " Well , " said the Director , heavily . " You might as well get started . " He nodded his head in dismissal .

" Closed for us , but  --  " He hesitated a moment , and then sighing once more , signed his name in the space provided . * * * * * AUGUST 6 , 430th Year GALACTIC ERA Tee Ormond sat morosely at the spaceport bar , and alternately wiped his forehead with a soggy handkerchief , and sipped at his frosted rainbow , careful not to disturb the varicolored layers of liquid in the tall narrow glass . Every now and then he nervously ran his fingers through his straight black hair , which lay damply plastered to his head . His jacket was faded and worn , and above the left pocket was emblazoned the meteor insignia of the spaceman . A dark patch on his back showed where the perspiration had seeped through . He blinked and rubbed the corner of his eye as a drop of perspiration ran down and settled there . A casual look would have classified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found at the bar of any spaceport ; i.e. if space pilots can ever be classified as average . Spacemen are the last true adventurers in an age where the debilitating culture of a highly mechanized civilization has pushed to the very borders of the galaxy . While most men are fearful and indecisive outside their narrow specialties the spacemen must at all times be ready to deal with the unexpected and the unusual . The expression  --  " Steady as a spaceman 's nerves "  --  had a very real origin . A closer look at Tee would have revealed the error of a quick classification . He gripped his drink too tightly , and his eyes darted restlessly from side to side , as though searching , searching ; yet dreading to find the object of their search . His expressive face contorted in a nervous tic each time his eyes swept by the clock hanging behind the bar . He glanced dispiritedly out the window at the perpetually cloudy sky and idly watched a rivulet of water race down the dirty pane . He loosened his collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then irritably flung it to the floor . " Hey , Jo , " he yelled to the bartender . " What 's the matter with the air-conditioning ? I 'm burning up . " " Take it easy , " soothed the bartender , consulting a thermometer on the wall behind him , " it 's eighty-five in here . That 's as low as the law allows . Ca n't have too much difference in the temperature or all my customers 'd pass out when they go outside . Why do n't you go into town ? They keep it comfortable under the dome . " " Do n't this planet ever cool off ? " asked Tee . The bartender chuckled . " I see you do n't know too much about Thymis . Sometimes it drops to ninety at night , but not too often . You ought to be here sometime when the clouds part for a minute . If you 're caught outside then , it 's third-degree burns for sure . " He glanced down at the nearly empty glass . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in you , you wo n't notice the heat  --  you wo n't notice anything . " He laughed uproariously at the hoary joke . * * * * * Tee looked at him disgustedly and without answering bent to his drink once more . He felt someone jostle his elbow and turned sideways to allow the newcomer access to the bar . After a moment he wiped his forehead on his sleeve . The bartender placed another rainbow before him . " Hey , I did n't order that , " he cried . The bartender nodded toward the next stool . " On him . " Tee turned and saw a barrel-chested red-haired giant holding up a drink in the immemorial bar toast . He raised his own glass gingerly , but his trembling hand caused the layers to mix and he stared ruefully at the resultant clayey-looking mess . The redhead laughed . " Mix another one , Jo . " " But  --  " Tee 's face got red . " I came in here to talk to you anyway , " said the giant . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , what about it ? " " Like to get her out of hock ? " " Who says she 's in hock ? " " Look , " said the redhead . " Let 's not kid each other . Everybody around this port knows you blew in from Lemmyt last month and ca n't raise the money to pay the port charges , much less the refueling fee . And it 's no secret that you 're anxious to leave our fair planet . " He winked conspiringly at Tee . " So ? " The redhead glanced at the bartender who was busy at the other end of the bar . He leaned closer and whispered . " I know where the Elen of Troy is . " " The Elen of Troy ? " " Oh , that 's right , you would n't know about her . Eight months ago she crashed on an uninhabited planet somewhere in this sector . So far they 've been unable to find her . " He leaned closer . " She was carrying four million in Penryx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The redhead looked around briefly to make sure no one was in hearing distance , then whispered softly , without moving his lips . " I told you , they ca n't find her , but I know where she is . " " You know ? But how  --  " " Look , " said the giant , frowning , " I did n't ask you why you 're so anxious to leave . " " Well ? " " I 'll clear your ship and we can pick up the crystals for the salvage fee . A million each , and all nice and legal . We can leave by the end of the week and be back in probably six months . " " Six months ! " Tee stood up . " Sorry ! " The redhead grabbed his arm in a hamlike palm . " A million each in six months ; what 's wrong with that ? " Tee jerked out of his grasp . " I ... I just ca n't do it . " " I do n't know what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a million credits you can fight extradition for the rest of your life . This is your big chance , ca n't you see that . Besides , this planet has some interesting customs . " He winked at Tee . " I can introduce you  --  " " I ca n't stay here , " interrupted Tee . " You just do n't understand . " " Look , " cried the redhead exasperatedly , " I 'm offering you a full partnership on a two million credit salvage deal and you want to back out because it 'll take six months . On top of that you 're broke and stranded and your hangar bill gets bigger every day . If you do n't take me up on this deal , you 'll still be sitting here six months from now wondering how to get your ship out of hock  --  if you do n't get caught first . What do you say ? What 've you got to lose ? " What did he have to lose ? Tee gripped the edge of the bar till his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do it . Why do n't you get someone else ? " " The slow tubs around this port would take years for the trip . I can see the Starduster has class . " " Fastest thing in the galaxy , " said Tee , proudly . Then earnestly , " I 'm sorry , you 'll just have to find some other ship . " " Think it over , " said the redhead . " I 'll wait . When you change your mind look me up . Name 's Yule Larson . " He slapped Tee heavily on the back and swaggered toward the door . He turned and looked back . " Better go along with me . After six months they can auction off your ship to pay for the port charges , you know . " The door swung shut behind him . * * * * * Tee sat down again and bent his head , nursing his drink . His eyes darted nervously around the room and came to rest on the clock . A shudder ran through him and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes returned to the clock continually , as though drawn there against their will . As he watched , the minute hand jerked downward and an involuntary gasp escaped his lips . The bartender turned quickly . " Anything wrong ? " " N ... no , nothing . " As he spoke , the minute hand moved again and Tee started nervously , upsetting his drink . He sat for a moment watching the bartender mop up the spreading liquid , then abruptly got up and tossed a half-credit piece on the bar . He hurried outside , steeling himself to keep from running . He paused just outside the door . Stand still , he told himself . Must n't run ! Must n't run ! No use anyway . If I only knew when . If I just could stop and rest . If I had the time ... Time ! Time ! That 's what I need . Light-years of time ... But when ? When ? If only I could be sure . He looked up slowly at the murky canopy of clouds . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the field , then squaring his shoulders resolutely , set out for the administration building . At this hour the office was deserted except for a wispy-haired little man who sat at a desk fussing with some papers . He looked up questioningly as Tee came in . " Is my ship re-charged and provisioned ? " asked Tee . " Uh , what 's the name please ? " " Tee Ormond . I own the Starduster . " The clerk pulled a card from a file on the desk and studied it . " Ah , yes , the Starduster . " " I 'd like to pay my bill and clear the Starduster for immediate departure . " " Uh , very good , Mr. Ormond . " He consulted the card again . " That 'll be fourteen hundred and eleven credits . " He beamed . " We included a case of Ruykeser 's Concentrate , compliments of the management . " He handed a circular to Tee . " This is a list of our ports and facilities on other planets . Our accommodations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parts . " He smiled professionally . " What about my key ? " asked Tee , pulling out his wallet . " Uh , let 's see , number thirty-seven . " The clerk started for a numbered board hanging on the wall . He never got there . Tee whipped a stun-gun from inside his jacket and waved it at the clerk 's back . It caught him in mid-stride , and unbalanced , he crashed heavily to the floor . Tee glanced briefly down as he stepped over the paralyzed form , avoiding the accusing eyes , and snatched the magnetic key off the hook . He forced himself to walk calmly across the field toward the hangar that housed the Starduster . A uniformed guard stopped him at the hangar door . " May I see your clearance , sir ? " he asked , politely . Tee hesitated for a moment . " Oh , I 'm just going to get something out of my ship , " he said , smoothly . " The clerk said it was roj . " " The clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tensed . " Mind if I check , sir ? Orders , you know . " He bent his head slightly as he pressed a knob on his wrist radio . As his eyes turned downward , Tee swung the stun-gun in an arc that ended on the back of the guard 's head . As he leaped into the Starduster he was sorry for a moment that he had n't had time to recharge the gun , and hoped he had n't struck too hard . Illustration * * * * * OCTOBER 11 , 433rd Year GALACTIC ERA Tee stepped out of the hangar and surveyed the twin suns . The pale binaries sat stolidly on the horizon , forty degrees apart . Their mingled light washed down dimly on the single continent of the planet , Aurora . He started , as a man walked around the corner of the hangar . The man looked at Tee searchingly for a moment , then asked , " Anything troubling you , Tee ? " " Why ... why , no , Mr. Jenner . You just startled me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything coming ? " " Right on schedule . We 'll be ready for the final test by the end of the week . " " By the way , " asked Jenner , speculatively , " how come you ordered the ship stocked and provisioned , for the test ? " " Why ... why I think she should be tested under exactly the same conditions as she 'll encounter in actual use . " " We could have done it a lot cheaper by just using ballast , " said Jenner . " After this , I want to personally see any voucher for over a hundred credits before it 's cleared . " " Yes , sir , but I just did n't want to bother you with details . " " An expenditure of over two thousand credits is n't just detail ; but let it pass . It 's already done . Anyway , on the drawing board she 's the fastest thing in the galaxy . " He smiled . " If she lives up to expectations , she 'll make your ship look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her so far , so she 'd better check out roj . " He put his hand on Tee 's shoulder . " You 're not worried about testing her , are you ? You 've been jumpy lately . " " Oh , no , nothing like that , Mr. Jenner . I 'm just ... well , I 've been up all night watching them install the gyroscopes . Think I 'll get some sleep . " He yawned . Jenner cupped his chin in his palm and stood staring after the retreating figure . As Tee turned and looked back nervously , Jenner entered the hangar office . He spoke softly into the visiphone and in a moment the screen lit up . " Is this the prison administrator ? " asked Jenner . " What can I do for you ? " " My name is Jenner ; Consolidated Spacecraft . " " Yes ? " " Suppose an escaped prisoner from Hades landed on Aurora ? " " No one escapes from Hades Prison . " " Well , just suppose one did ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you 're the administrator here . " " My job , as the title implies , is purely administrative . I merely arrange transportation for our annual shipment of prisoners to Hades , and see that the records are kept straight . " " But whom would they contact in the event of an escape ? " The administrator pursed his lips in impatience . " Hades has six billion prisoners at any given time . If one did manage to escape , they could n't very well alert a million planets . " " You mean you would n't do anything ? " " As I said before , my job is purely administrative . Out of my jurisdiction entirely . Each planet has its own police force and handles its internal crime in its own way . What 's legal on Aurora might very well be illegal on ten thousand other planets , and vice versa . " " I see . Thank you . " Jenner cut the connection slowly . He flicked the switch open again , hesitated , and then closed it . * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was parked , and in a few minutes set it down on the roof of Tee 's hotel . Tee was just entering the lobby as Jenner came in and they went up to his room together . " I 'll come right to the point , Tee , " he said , as soon as the door had closed . " I just talked to the local prison administrator for Hades . " He looked closely at Tee . " What 's that got to do with me ? " asked Tee , belligerently . " Wait until I finish , " said Jenner , curtly . " I hired you to test-hop our new ship because you were the best pilot available . I 'm not interested in your past , but most of the company 's resources are sunk in that ship . If something goes wrong because the test pilot is disturbed or nervous , the company will be bankrupt . I 'm not saying you 're an escaped prisoner , but if you were , you 'd have nothing to worry about . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has no jurisdiction over escaped prisoners , so you see , if you had escaped , you 'd have nothing to fear here . You 're out of their jurisdiction . " Tee began to laugh wildly . " Out of their jurisdiction ! Out of their jurisdiction ! So that 's the way they put it . Out of their jurisdiction ! " " Stop it ! " said Jenner , sharply . " Do you want to tell me now ? " Tee drew in a gasping breath and sobered . " What would I have to tell you ? So I 'm the nervous type . So you hired me to test-hop your new ship . So I 'll test-hop it . That 's all we agreed on . What more do you want ? " Jenner sighed . " Roj , Tee , if that 's the way you want it , but I wish  --  " The visiphone buzzed , and when Tee flipped the switch , the worried face of the chief mechanic sprang into focus . " Oh , there you are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've run into trouble . " " Well , out with it , " barked Jenner . " What is it ? " The mechanic cleared his throat nervously . " We were testing the main gyroscope when it threw a blade . " " How bad is it ? " asked Jenner . " Pretty bad , I 'm afraid . It tore up the subetherscope unit so bad we 'll have to replace it . We ca n't get any on Aurora either . We 'll have to send to Lennix , and that 'll take close to a month . " " Roj ! Knock off until I get there , " barked Jenner . He slammed over the switch , viciously . " Of all the rotten luck ! " " Ca n't you get some plant here on Aurora to hand tool one for you ? " asked Tee . " No , that 's just it , " replied Jenner . " It 's a special alloy . The owners of the process would n't give us any details on the manufacture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't duplicate it without their special machine tools . " " Does that mean  --  " " I 'm afraid so . The ship wo n't be ready for a month , now . " " A month ! I ca n't wait a month . " " You ca n't wait a month ? We 've got four million tied up in that ship and you tell me you ca n't wait a month . " " Look , Mr. Jenner , I 'll test it without the unit . " " That 's impossible . The ship would vibrate into a billion pieces as soon as it went into subspace . No ! We 'll just have to wait . " " I ca n't wait , " cried Tee . " You 'll have to get another pilot . " " Just a minute ! You ca n't walk out on your contract . If it 's a matter of credits  --  " Tee shook his head . " That 's not it at all . I just ca n't stay that long . " Jenner looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up till the end of the week anyway . We 'll see what we can do about a replacement then . " * * * * * After Jenner had left , Tee sat smoking in the darkness . He placed his elbow on the couch arm and cupped his chin in his palm . Then restlessly , he snuffed out his cigarette and rubbed his hands together . They felt moist and clammy . He jerked nervously as a click sounded out in the hall . Only a door opening across the way . He bit the fleshy part of his middle finger and then began to worry his ring with his teeth . He lit another cigarette and dropped it into the disposal almost immediately . He got up and began to pace the room . Six steps forward . Turn . Six steps back . Turn . Six steps forward  --  or was it five this time ? The walls seemed to be closing in , constricting . His head felt light and his tongue and palate grew dry . He tried to swallow , and a feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he felt as though he were choking . Rubbing his forehead with the back of his hand it came away wet with perspiration . He rushed to the window and struggled futilely with it , forgetting it was sealed shut in the air-conditioned hotel . He flung himself at the door , wrenching it open and took the escalator three steps at a time falling to his knees at the ground floor . A surface cab was sitting outside just beyond the entrance . He flung himself in , breathing heavily and fumbling to drop a coin in the slot , pulled the control lever all the way over . Twenty minutes later , the Starduster hovered for a moment over Aurora , then shimmered and vanished as it went into subspace. * * * * * OCTOBER 2 , 435th Year GALACTIC ERA The Starduster materialized just outside the atmosphere of the planet Elysia , and fluttered erratically downward , like a wounded bird . A hundred feet from the surface , the ship hesitated , shuddered throughout her length , then dropped like a plummet , crashing heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long period of blessed darkness , of peace , of non-remembering , then his mind clawed upward toward consciousness . The fear and uncertainty were with him again  --  nagging , nibbling , gnawing at his reason . He fought to close his mind and drift back down into the darkness of peace and forgetting , but contrarily the past marched in review before his consciousness : The twin worlds of Thole revolving about each other as he fled down the shallow ravine before the creeping wall of lava , while the ancient mountain grunted and belched , and coughed up its insides . The terrible pull of the uncharted black star as it tugged at the feeble Starduster . The enervating heat and humidity of perpetually cloudy Thymis . Pyramids of gleaming penryx crystals piled high as mountains , and Yule Larson towering above the landscape , draining gargantuan rainbows at a single gulp ; striding like Paul Bunyan across the land in mile-long strides and kicking over the pyramids of crystals , laughing uproariously at the sport . And Jenner , grinning idiotically , pointing a thick finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their jurisdiction ! Nothing to fear ! Nothing to fear ! Nothing to fear ! Noth  --  " " Stop it ! Stop it ! " cried Tee , and a brilliant burst of light like a thousand sky-rockets seemed to go off in his head . He shrieked like an animal in agony , then fell back sobbing , bathed in perspiration . Something cool touched his forehead and he pulled away violently , then as his head cleared he opened his eyes slowly . A blur of shadows and light shimmering indistinctly , then suddenly like the picture on a visiphone the blurs coalesced and formed a clear image , and everything was normal again , the fear still hovering close , but pushed back for the time being . A girl stood before him smiling rather uncertainly . The sweetness and cleanness of that smile after his recent ordeal washed over his tortured mind like a cooling astringent , and he smiled gratefully up at her . She put a cool palm on his forehead and as she started to withdraw it he clutched it in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smiled down at him and smoothed back his damp hair . She pulled up a chair beside the bed and continued to stroke his hair until his eyes closed in sleep . He awoke ravenous and thirsty , but lay quietly for a time , luxuriating in the feel of the clean soft sheets . He was in a simply but tastefully decorated room . Three of the walls were made of transparent glass and the warm golden rays of a type G sun bathed the room . Outside he could see green rolling meadowland , broken here and there by sylvan groves . A brilliantly colored bird swooped down and preened itself for a moment , then raised its head and flooded the silence with melody . Faintly from a grove of trees came an answering treble . The songbird cocked its head to the side , listening , then swooped upward on wings of flashing color . A small squirrellike creature bounded nervously up to the transparent wall and sat on its haunches , surveying the room with bright beady eyes . As Tee 's ears attuned themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistles , and from somewhere in the depths of the grove , a deep-pitched ga-rooph , ga-roomph. * * * * * A chubby little man with a round face and alert twinkling eyes entered the room . He seemed to radiate happiness and contentment . " Well , I see the patient 's finally come around , " he said , cheerfully . " What happened ? " asked Tee . " Your ship crashed just beyond that grove . " Tee clutched at him . " The ship ! How bad is it ? " " I think you were in worse shape than your ship . You must have had it under control almost to the end , though how you stayed conscious with space fever is beyond me . " " Space fever ? So that 's it . I remember getting sick and light-headed and just before I passed out I flipped out of subspace and the automatic finder , of course , took the ship to the nearest planet . I must have landed by reflex action . I sure do n't remember anything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I have seen better landings , but not when the pilot had a temperature of one-o-five . Anyway , you 're safe now . Welcome to Elysia . " There it was again . Safe ! Safe ! Tee raised up , then fell back weakly . " Is anything wrong ? " asked the little man , alarmed . " N ... nothing , I just ... nothing ! " The man was looking at him questioningly . " Elysia , " mused Tee . " I seem to remember an old old myth brought from the original Earth . " He waved toward the sylvan setting , outside . The little man smiled . " Yes , the old settlers named our planet well . " He caught himself . " Oh , I 'm sorry ; I 'm Dr. Chensi . This is my home . " Tee smiled . " Well at least you 'll have to admit I showed good judgment crashing next to a doctor 's house . " Then more seriously , " Thanks , doc , thanks for everything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Chensi . " I 'm afraid I had little to do with your recovery . My daughter 's the one who nursed you . Oh , here she is now . " He raised his voice . " Come in , Lara . " Since Dr. Chensi was using the only chair she sat down on the edge of the bed . " Here , " said the doctor , teasingly , " what kind of nurse are you , mussing up your patient 's bed ? " She pouted prettily . " He 's my patient . " Then looking down at Tee with a smile , " You 'll be up and around in no time now . " " Time ! " cried Tee , raising up . " What 's the date ? I 've got to know ! " " You 've been delirious for two weeks , " answered the doctor . " Another two weeks of convalescence and you ought to be as good as new . " " But two weeks , I ca n't  --  " " Ca n't leave before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew you 'd want your ship repaired so I had it hauled to the port . Wo n't be ready for two more weeks .

" Nothing else I can do , I guess . Thanks , anyway . And by the way , there 's enough credits in the ship 's safe to pay for the repairs , I 'm sure . " " I think we should start the patient walking tomorrow , " said Lara , in a mock-professional voice . She punched the ends of Tee 's pillow . " Now you 'd better get some sleep . You 're still very weak , you know . " * * * * * The days that followed were like an idyll for Tee . With Lara he wandered through the parklike wooded groves . They sat near shaded pools and ate wild berries while she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and ran exuberantly across the grassy meadows , and waded like children in the clear brooks . A thousand times , a word , an endearing term , sprang to his lips , and each time the fear clamped his tongue in a vise of steel . A thousand times he wanted to touch her , feel the silkiness of her hair , the warmth of her lips , but each time the fear and uncertainty stood between them like twin specters of doom , pointing and saying , " Fool ! Why torture yourself ? " In the daytime when Lara was with him it was n't so bad , but at night the fear and uncertainty crowded to the fore and blanked out everything else . It was then he prayed for the courage to kill himself , and despised the weakness that made him draw back from the thought . If only he could stop thinking . Make his mind a blank . But that was death , and death was what he feared . How long ago was it when he 'd first realized that hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lied , and held out vain promises only to prolong the torture ? Then one day the word came that his ship was repaired . As though the word were a catalyst the terrible fear overwhelmed him , drowning out every other thought , and he knew he had to leave . When he had no means of leaving the planet he could partially close off his dread and wait resignedly . But now that the ship was ready , every moment he remained was an agony . He led Lara to their favorite spot by a quiet pool . She looked radiant , and smiled to herself , as though at a secret . He steeled himself and finally blurted out , " Lara , I 'm leaving tomorrow . " He hesitated and bit his lip . " And ... thanks for everything . " " Thanks ? " She choked on the words . " I 'm sorry  --  " he trailed off , lamely . " But ... but I thought  --  " She looked down . He reached out and gently touched her cheek . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pleaded . " Then why ? Why ? " She was crying now . " I ... I just ca n't . It 's no good . " He stood up . She reached out and caught his hand . " Then take me with you . I 've heard you at night pacing in your room . I do n't know what it is that drives you on and on , but if space is what you want , let me go with you . I can help you , darling . You 'll see . And some day when you grow tired of space , we can come back to Elysia . " She was babbling now . He pulled roughly away . " No ! It 's no good . I 'm  --  If only I could stay . " He brushed her hair softly with his palm and as she reached out toward him he turned and walked swiftly toward the house , pitying and hating himself by turn , while Lara sat forlornly by the pool looking after him . He began to sweat before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , he had to stop for a moment , to keep his balance . Determinedly he started forward again and continued on past the house to the highway that wound by half a kilometer away . There he hailed a passing ground car and rode to the spaceport , where a few judiciously distributed credits facilitated his immediate clearance . Before the ship had even left the atmosphere he rammed in the subspace control . * * * * * MAY 4 , 437th Year GALACTIC ERA Tantalus lay far out on a spiral arm , well away from the main stream of traffic that flowed through the galaxy . It was a fair planet boasting an equable climate , at least in the tropic zone . But as yet the population was small , consisting mostly of administrative officials who served their alloted time and thankfully returned to their home planets closer to the center of population . Tee entered the towering building and after consulting a wall directory stepped into the antigrav chute and was whisked high up into the heart of the building . He stepped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel fluoresced briefly with the printed legend  --  GALACTIC PRISON AUTHORITY , Ary Mefford , Administrator for Tantalus . He hesitated for a moment , then squaring his shoulders stepped forward , and as he crossed the beam the door swung open before him . The gray-haired man sitting at the desk studying a paper , looked up and smiled politely . He indicated a chair with a nod then bent his head again . After a moment he shoved the paper aside and looked questioningly at Tee . " I want to give myself up , " blurted Tee . " I 'm the administrator for Hades , " said the man calmly . " I think you want the local authorities . " " You do n't understand . I escaped from Hades . " " No one escapes from Hades , " replied the administrator . " I escaped ! " insisted Tee . " Ten years ago . You can check . I 'm tired of running . I want to go back . " " This is most unusual , " said the administrator in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten years ago you say ? " " Yes ! Yes ! And I 'm ready to go back , before it 's too late . Ca n't you understand ? " The administrator shook his head pityingly . " It 's already too late . I 'm sorry . " He bent his head guiltily and began to fumble with the papers on his desk . Tee started to say something , but the administrator raised his head and said slowly , " It was too late the day you left Hades . Nothing I can do . " He looked down again . Tee turned and slowly walked out the door . The administrator did n't look up . As Tee walked aimlessly down the deserted corridor , his footsteps echoed hollowly like a dirge . A line from an old poem sprang to his mind : " We are the dead , row on row we lie  --  " He was the dead , but still he chased the chimera of hope , yet knowing in his heart it was hopeless . * * * * * JUNE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pitted from innumerable collisions with dust particles , sped out and out . The close-packed suns of the central hub lay far behind . Here at the rim of the galaxy the stars lay scattered , separated by vast distances . A gaunt hollow-eyed figure sat in the observation bubble staring half-hopefully , half-despairingly at the unimaginable depths beyond the rim . * * * * * JUNE 12 , 437th Year GALACTIC ERA On and on past the thinning stars raced the patient electronic bloodhound ; invisible , irreversible , indestructible ; slowly , but inexorably accelerating . It flashed by the planet Damocles at multiples of the speed of light , and sensing the proximity of the prey on which it was homed , spurted into the intergalactic depths after the receding ship , intent on meshing with and thereby distorting the encephalograph pattern of its target . It was quite mindless , and the final pattern its meshing would create would be something quite strange , and not very human . THE END               @ @ @ @ @ @
