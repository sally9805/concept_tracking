TWO things struck me when I sneakpreviewed the 1951 Pontiac ? a smoothed-out Hydra-Matic and a fine rough-road ride . Basically , Pontiac looks the same as in ' 50 . It has the lines of a dependable family car that the Missus drives to the grocery . Only the de luxe models have the color and extra chrome associated with " flash " styling . It is still a car for America 's Main Streets . For all Pontiac Division 's style conservatism ? incidentally something that can save an owner bucks on depreciation ? they 've made plenty of small mechanical changes . For instance , they 've put a bumper pad near the timing chain to keep it from whipping as wear occurs . They 've put a new carburetor on the six . The cooling system has been changed for faster warm-up . Compression stays comparatively low at 6.51-to-1 . Pontiac is n't a car that wo n't thrive on regular gas . I drove the new jobs last fall at the General Motors Proving Ground near Milford , Mich . It 's unquestionably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have 25 miles of roads , including one " Belgian block " stretch so rough it could wreck anything that took it too fast . They have a fine " Loop " with separate speed lanes . In fact , the 1,225-acre setup is so big , that wildlife is actually a problem . Although the whole place is fenced in , deer  | occasionally jump the fence and recently one animal bashed in a glistening sedan . When I showed up , the Pontiac Motor Division had two tuned-up ' 51 mounts waiting for me in the garage . One was a six with Hydra-Matic , the other a straight eight with a manual shift . The eight looked slick , but I was more interested in the six , which kicks out 96 hp. at 3,400 engine revolutions . Here 's the playback from a recording of my reactions : The hold-open on this door is the best I 've ever seen . . . it 's positive in engagement . . . and quiet . They tell me there are four speeds in the drive range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Firing up still seems to be a two-handed job . . . you turn the switch with your right hand and press the starter button with hour left . Why do n't more manufacturers follow Ford and put the two together on the left ? This car is nicely proportioned , though it is n't as wide as some of the others . . . at least you can reach the door handle on the opposite side without lying down flat . . . Let 's see how this baby picks up . Light throttle now , and we shift into second gear at 6 miles an hour . . . there 's third at about 12 miles an hour . . . fourth at about 30 . You can delay these shifts with harder throttle . I was disturbed by something , or a lack of something , that I had n't quite figured out yet . At this point we rolled onto the Belgian block pavement . It was rough , no doubt about that . They 've done a job on these rear springs . I 've driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept wallowing until they thudded on the bumper blocks . There was the same load in the rear seat that there is in this Pontiac . but there are no hits here . . . we have n't touched a bumper block yet . I do n't like this visor . . . they 've put an accessory visor on the front of this car like a bill on a cap . . . it gets in my way .. . You do n't get a sharp downshift as you decelerate .. . All of a sudden , I had it . I knew what had been bothering me . It was the absence of the klunking , in shifting from one gear to another , that I had always associated with automatic mechanical-shift transmissions . The transition from one gear to another was so smooth that it was hardly discernible . I began to experiment . Try as I might , I could n't regularly catch the shift into fourth gear . They 've made a ride , all right . . . you wo n't get a better ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low spring rate . . . I ca n't get over how this car keeps its feet on the ground on rough going . . . there 's no hopping . I do n't like the position of the brake pedal . It 's too close to the accelerator .. . on automatic jobs , they ought to put the pedal over where you can work it with either foot . . . the tires give a normal amount of squawk on tight turns . . . lower tire pressure and you get more squeal . . . that 's the penalty you pay for a soft ride . The seat arrangement is good . I like the steering ... a pretty good-sized man could  | get under this wheel comfortably . . . the backup is smooth . . . there is n't that shudder you get with some of the torque-converter transmissions . The steepest hill on the proving ground is a 27-percent grade . It 's so tough I wanted to try this six on it . On the way I rounded some curves a little fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve on that , considering tread and ' height , with better stabilizing . . . There were four people in the car . As I approached the foot of the hill , I had an impulse to get a run to make the top . Instead , I braked to a stop to make it really hard on the engine and transmission . She starts easily enough . . . but what will she do with this load ? We 're gaining  | speed . . . she 's in Drive , too ... gaining . I called over my shoulder to Hubert Luckett , a POPULAR SCIENCE photographer in the back seat , that I 'd bet him a buck the car would shift into second before we got to the top . He covered me . Still gaining speed . . . it 's a shame to take your money , Lucky . . . there 's the shift . . . over the top . Going down the hill , I was agreeably surprised to find that the Hydra-Matic gave me more engine braking power than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll the six with the throttle floored . The speedometer needle stood at 95 m.p.h. as I eased off . Even allowing for instrument error , that 's pretty good with 96 hp . Next I took a brief turn in the eight . It felt like its 20 additional horsepower . What interested me more was its appointments . There were no bright surfaces to reflect sunlight in your eyes . The heatingventilating system was so well-labeled you did n't have to be checked out to run it . The body was roomy but Pontiac has n't wasted sheet metal in enclosing dead air that you carry around just for looks . As I braked the eight to a stop , a mechanic in coveralls strolled over . " What do you think ? " he asked . " Wrap it up , " I replied , " and I 'll take it along with me. "  |
