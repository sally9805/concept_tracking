Washington last month checked on the acceptability of Charles E. Bohlen as U.S. Ambassador to replace George F. Kennan , declared unacceptable by the Russians . The Russian reply : Bohlen is persona grata . Then , where the Administration did not expect it , trouble arose . <P> Some Senate Republicans , studying Bohlen 's record , had doubts . Handsome , Harvard-bred " Chip " Bohlen has made Russia his special field ever since he entered the Foreign Service in 1929 . State assigned him to study Russian , sent him to Moscow ( along with Kennan ) in the ' 30s . Russia fascinated Bohlen ; he even became an expert balalaika player . By 1944 he was chief of Eastern European Affairs ( Russia , Poland , the Baltic countries ) in Washington . At Teheran and Yalta , Bohlen served as interpreter and aide for Franklin Roosevelt . He sat with F.D.R. and Averell Harriman , facing Stalin , Molotov and their interpreter , Pavlov , when the secret agreement on Manchuria was finally worked out . He subsequently became Counselor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acheson . <P> When Bohlen appeared early this month before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , he was hard pressed by Republicans . They questioned him especially about Yalta . Bohlen could have replied that he was merely an interpreter at Yalta ; instead , he defended the secret deals , although he blamed the Russians for violating their terms . While the Senators pondered Bohlen 's defense of past policy , Stalin died . The Administration wanted Bohlen confirmed quickly . But a strong Republican bloc refused to hurry . Last week their opposition came out into the open . <P> New Hampshire 's Styles Bridges let it be known that the withdrawal of Bohlen 's name had been urged on " top " Eisenhower aides . " We had an election , " said Bridges , " and the Acheson-Truman policies were repudiated . Bohlen is an architect and part of the team determining those policies . I do n't see why we should send such a man to one of the most delicate spots in the world . We should have a man in whom we , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostility ranged in degree . Michigan 's Homer Ferguson and California 's William Knowland were not really happy about the nomination . Nevada 's crusty Democrat , Pat McCarran , joined the GOP opposition ; Bohlen 's link with Yalta , he said , is " enough for me . " Ohio 's Robert Taft , in his role of Republican pacifier , thought the Moscow ambassadorship not important enough for a big intraparty battle . " Our Russian ambassador ca n't do anything . He is in a box at Moscow . All he can do is observe and report . He will not influence policy materially . " <P> That was a better argument before Stalin died than it is today . While the Kremlin has not changed , Western opinion is far more susceptible to the suggestion that the Kremlin might change . Conceivably , Bohlen 's reports could have an effect as misleading as those of Ambassador Joseph E. ( Mission to Moscow ) Davies . <P> This week Chip Bohlen was down with the measles just when he was scheduled to undergo another round of questioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed , but not without a fight .
