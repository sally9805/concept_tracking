No U.S. President has worked harder than Dwight Eisenhower to maintain friendly and constitutionally proper relationships with Congress . But last week , in the sharpest words he has yet addressed toward Capitol Hill , the President showed that his cooperative attitude does not extend to letting the legislative branch take over the functions of the executive . <P> In Section 638 of this year 's $31.8 billion Defense Department appropriations bill , Congress stipulated that the Secretary of Defense must get permission from the Senate and . House Appropriations Committees before he takes the armed forces out of such nonmilitary activities as cake-baking , dry cleaning and coffee-roasting . The section was tacked on to the bill by members of the House and Senate whose districts vare graced with such federal activities , e.g. , Leverett Saltonstall. the Senate G.O.P. whip , who was protecting the rope-twisting installation at the Charlestown , Mass , navy yard . President Eisenhower had a hard label for the Capitol Hill handiwork : " An unconstitutional invasion of the province of the executive . " <P> " The U.S. Constitution divides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the executive and the judicial , " wrote the President in an unusual message to Congress , " and establishes the principle that they shall be kept separate . . . The Congress has the power and right to grant or deny an appropriation . But once an appropriation is made , it must , under the Constitution , be administered by the executive branch of the Government alone , and the Congress has no right to confer upon its committees the power to veto executive action or to prevent executive action from becoming effective . Since the organization of our Government , the President has felt bound to insist that executive functions be maintained unimpaired by legislative encroachment , just as the legislative branch has felt bound to resist interference with its power by the executive . " <P> The President said that he signed the appropriations bill for the sole reason that the Defense Department urgently needed the money . Then in a rare but not unprecedented step , * he announced flatly that the executive branch would pay no attention to the section that it considered invalid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its $140 million cut in Atomic Energy Commission funds , which the President said would disrupt work on atomic weapons and impede the development of nuclear propulsion and peaceful uses of atomic energy . Democratic Senator Clinton Anderson , Joint Atomic Energy Committee chairman , agreed that " the cuts did go too far , " called a meeting of his committee to consider reinstating the AEC funds . <P> Visited Democratic Senate Leader Lyndon Johnson at the Bethesda ( Md. ) naval hospital , where Johnson is still confined after his recent heart attack ( TIME , July 11 ) . <P> Nominated Solicitor General Simon E. Sobeloff to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Maryland ( Sobeloff 's home state ) . West Virginia , Virginia , North and South Carolina circuit . <P> Studied and signed 65 congressional bills , thereby clearing his desk for Geneva . <P>
