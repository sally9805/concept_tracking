All through the 25,000 green and watery square miles between the Cascade Mountains and the Pacific Ocean that constitute the Episcopal diocese of Olympia , Wash. , people knew last week that the bishop was back . And in Seattle , Bishop Stephen Fielding Bayne Jr. , 50 , just returned from a trip to Russia and five weeks at London 's Lambeth Conference , climbed into a U-Drive-It Chevrolet , set out on a fast 2,000-mile trip to tell his Episcopal flock what he had seen and heard . Somewhere , between the spaghetti-and-meatball church suppers , busy Bishop Bayne knew he would have to fit in a few other chores , including the preparation and delivery of three sermons each Sunday , a meeting of the State Child Welfare Advisory Committee , the christening of a minister 's baby , the welcome for the Presiding Episcopal Bishop of Japan , the 50th anniversary celebration of the Episcopal Church in Seattle 's Japanese community , and the annual meeting of Diocesan Women . <P> Then he would be off again-to next month 's Episcopal General Convention in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates to succeed retiring Henry Knox Sherrill as U.S. Presiding Bishop , top office in the Episcopal Church . <P> Bishop Bayne himself played down his chances : " For a week I was the golden boy at Lambeth , + and people get ideas .

" <P> Naval Hitch . Manhattan-bred , Amherst-educated Bishop Bayne is not happy at the possibility of leaving what he calls " God 's Country " - the diocese that was one of the smallest in his church when he came to it eleven years ago , has since grown from 18,000 to almost 40,000 . He came to Washington from a slum parish in St. Louis , a town-and-gown parish in Northampton , Mass .

" If I had lived in the 18th century , " he once said , " I would probably have been a Methodist . " <P> Joy in Battle . Bishop Bayne wades into the big picture-race relations , social reform , international affairs-with the kind of joy in battle that has given him a reputation as one of the most outspoken churchmen in the U.S. Sample blasts : <P> On the Dave Beck labor union scandals ( for which he coined the term " beck-adilloes " ) : " Irresponsible power-power wielded by labor tycoons as well as by management tycoons , wielded by cynical men who are above any moral law except the income tax . . .
