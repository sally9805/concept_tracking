" What a day ! What a battle ! A fireworks , an explosion , six hours of relentless fighting , six hours of violent breakaways , of frantic pursuits , of spectacular escapes ! " This had nothing to do with Korea or Indo-China . It was a French sportwriter just wanning up to the famed <P> Tour de France , the month-long bicycle race that attracts the world 's largest crowds . <P> Flanked and followed by 360 cars , trucks and ambulances , containing doctors , managers , officials , timekeepers , mechanics , journalists , wives and mistresses , 123 racing cyclists of eight nations last week began the 2,900-mile marathon that started in Metz , will cut through a corner of Belgium , down the middle of France to Marseille and the Riviera , back through Geneva to the finish line in Paris . Along the route some 20 million fans will shout themselves hoarse with cries of " Allez Bo-bet ! " , " Vas-y Barbotin ! " ) " Bonne chance , Louis ! " <P> Last year emotion ran so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dirty Fascists ! " at the Italian team , and one superheated patriot knocked veteran Gino Bartali off his bike . The outraged Italian team withdrew , and the French Foreign Ministry sent formal regrets to the Italian ambassador . Tempers have since simmered down , but this year 's route bypasses Italy , just in case of reprisals . <P> At the end of each day 's lap , the panting winner is warmly bussed by the local beauty queen , wined &; dined by the citizenry and allowed to wear the coveted yellow sweater ( le maillot jaune ) . The eventual winner of the yellow sweater stands to gain some 5,000,000 /rancs ( $15,000 ) in prize money and commercial premiums . When Italy 's Bartali won in 1948 , the Pope himself sent a telegram of congratulation and blessing . <P> <P> *The eight : France , Italy , Belgium , Luxembourg , Switzerland , The Netherlands , Spain and North Africa .
