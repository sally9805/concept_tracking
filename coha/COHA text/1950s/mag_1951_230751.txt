Although Hollywood 's top moviemakers are confident that they can hold TV at least to a draw without having to join their mushrooming rival , two more independent studios last week followed the lead of the profitable Hal Roach TV film operation ( TIME , Oct. 29 ) . Republic Pictures cleared its throat , announced that it had set aside $1,000,000 to enlarge its sound stage space for TV film production and to finance its first pictures for television ( one character already on tap : Commando Cody , Sky Marshal of the Universe ) . Next day , Monogram Pictures fell in line , announced that it had set up a wholly owned subsidiary to make movies for TV . Still to be heard from : any of Hollywood 's major studios , now riding the crest of a new movie box-office boom .
