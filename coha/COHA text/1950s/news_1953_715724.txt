Durkin resigned as Secretary , of Labor today , protesting that the White House had backed down on an agreement to send to Con. gress nineteen proposed amendments to the Taft-Hartley Law . . Mr. Durkin said that the agree : , ment had been made with members of the President 's staff , and that he had believed they had powr er to represent President Eisen. : hower and that the President was being kept informed . President Eisenhower , after con : ferring with Mr. Durkin for half ail hour , accepted the resignation , ef : fective immediately . The President 's letter to the first departing member of his Cabinet was one of warm , personal friendliness . It pressed his regret but did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Durkin 's letter , which was made public later at the President 's vacation headquarters in Denver , was friendly , too , and did not mention any dispute . He said that words failed him in attempting to thank the President for appointing him . Mr. Durkin wrote that he was resigning because it was " necessary " for him to return to his post as president of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry , A. F. L. Two Issues Are Stressed He told a news conference that his desire to return to his union post was one of the reasons for his , resigning , but the emphasis was Ilput on two other reasons : the White House refusal to honor the lagreement that he said had been made , and the failure of the Administration to take any position on Taft-Hartley Law amendments . Mr , Durkin said that he had written his letter in longhand at home on Aug. 31 and had consulted no one about it .

The draft was attacked as too pro-labor and politically unwise , Vice President Richard M. Nixon , who was a member of the House Labor Committee in 1947 when ibis Taft-Hartley Act was written , was chiefly instrumental in killing the proposed message , but he had help ' from others , including the commit -- tee chairmen . Criticism of Draft Voiced The critics of the draft said that it undermined two fundamentals of the labor law : the bans on the , closed shop and on the secondaili boycott . A White House spokes , man , commenting on a draft thetgot into print at the time , insiged that work on the message was no. where near complete .

SECRETARY DURKIN QUITS CABINET POST // - ? ler of persons who had sat in on : Meetings for the purpose of reachatig an agreement on Taft-Hartley 1. , aw amendments . The White House ; - Ataff members who attended were tBernard M. Shanley , special cotmrel to the President , and Gerald -D . Morgan , a special assislant . " Did they have full power to : represent the President ? " Mr. Durkin was asked . " I was n't informed to the conIrary , " he replied . - President Eisenhower attended none of the meetings , and Mr. ) urkin said : " It was our belief that the Presldent was being kept informed . : We believed he had agreed to them " the amendments . " it . The draft of a message preTared ed for the President to send to ' Congress just before adjournment ' Was weighted heavily with concessions to labor . The draft did not contain the major changes urged py management spokesmen . - The main proposals in the draft Were : gThe National Labor Relations Board would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts for injunctions in secondary boycotts , which rare strikes against one employer to put pressure on the primary employer in a dispute . Some secondary boycott activities would be legalized. flUnions and employers in the building construction , maritime and entertainment industries would be permitted to make agreements before any employes were hired and the agreement could require the employes to join a union after Oven days , instead of after thirty days as provided in the union shop section that is now applicable to industry generally . ? cSupervisors whose duties consisted only of giving directions to employes or assigning work to them would be treated as employes subject to the law , but front-line management supervisors would remain exempt . 11Unions would be subject to the common ? law definition of an " agent " so that they would not be held responsible for the acts of an individual member solely because of membership . clUnions could expel a member and demand his discharge if - he disclosed confidential information of the union or ' if there . was reasonable cause to believe he nad subversive intentions against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a union to cause an employe 's discharge Only if he refuses to pay his dues . IThe injunction provisions in the law , including the national emergency section , would remain , modified only to the extent that the injunction would be discretionary , not mandatory , in boycotts . Another factor may have figured in Mr. Durkin 's resignation , but to what extent could not be determined ' He had objected to the proposed nomination of L. E. Gooding to be a member of the National Labor Relations Board on the basis of opposition from organized labor in Wisconsin . Mr. Gooding is chairman of the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board . If the President intended , nevertheless , to appoint Mr. Gooding to the N. L. R. B. , it would have been a blow to Mr. Durkin , who as recently as Aug. 11 had defended the Administration and had said that . he occupied a more " realistic position " as Secretary of Labor than any of his predecessors because he was consulted on all proposed appointments having to do with labor in the Government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Durkin had great difficulty getting a team together in the department , because of political difficulties at the White House and in Congress . Ironically , he wrote his resignation on the day he completed his team . Harrison Hobart was sworn in as Assistant Secretary on Aug. 31 . Mr. ' Durkin said that the Under Secretary , Lloyd A. Mashburn , would become Acting Secretary when he left . Mr. Mashburn would not say how long he would remain . He , like Mr. Durkin , is , an American Federation , ' of Labor building tradesman , a member of the International Union of Wood , Wire and Metal Lathers . The Durkin resignation is not only the first of a Cabinet member in the Eisenhower Administration but also , in the opinion of competent observers , is an indication of a partial failure of a policy to woo organized labor support . He also was the only Roman Catholic member of the Cabinet . Mr. Durkin is a Democrat , and he supported the Democratic candidate for President , Adlai Stevenson , in 1952 . His selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line with President Eisenhower 's expressed belief that the views of the Republican leadership and labor leaders on the Taft-Hartley Act could be reconciled on a law that would be fair to all . The late Senator Robert A. Taft , Republican of Ohio , termed the Durkin appointment ? " incredible , ' ) because . Mr. Durkin had stood for outright repeal of the labor law and had supported the ' Democratic candidate . His resignation , ? it is believed , will intensify the criticism that most labor leaders have directed at the Administration . This is expected to be demonstrated in. the American Federation of Labor convention , which opens on Sept. 21 in St. Louis . Mr. Durkin said that he would attend as a delegate , but did not plan to speak because he would no longer be Secretary of Labor . It would not surprise many , however , if he changed his mind and decided to speak . George Meant ' , president of the A.F.L. , commented on the resignation as follows : " The background of this matter is quite familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labor movement that once an agreement has been reached the parties abide by it . Mr. Durkin is schooled in this tradition . He resigned because he could not continue serving on a team where agreements are not kept . " I Many in Washington shared Senator Taft 's view that .. the appointment was " Incredible " and , continued to believe so , as reports filtered from official circles of conflicts in views between the Secretary and other Administration officials . There were other evidences that ) Mr. Durkin did not fit on the team . He was . reported to have told a friend that when he walked into a room " everybody stopped talking . " At one of his infrequent news conferences it was noted that he referred , quite unconsciously , to the Administration and Administration groups /as " they , " rather than as In his letter to Mr. Durkin President Eisenhower said : " I deeply regret the necessity expressed in your letter of Aug. ' 31 compelling you to return to private life . You will be both missed and remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a career of renewed distinction " ' in whatever Mr. Durkin undertook . Mr. Durkin , answering questions , today , made no direct criticism of , the President personally and , in fact , refused again to agree with the criticism of Peter J. Schoemann , who has teen the acting president of the Plumbers union Mr. Schoemann wrote an article in the union magazine entitled , " Pattern of Plunder , " that sharply attacked the Administration . Mr. Durkin , who publicly assailed that article on Aug. 11 , was asked about his own publication plans when he resumed the union presidency . " There will be no articles on plunder unless I find plunder , " he replied . " So far I have n't found any . "
