txt The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis has contracted to purchase enough Salk polio vaccine to immunize 9,000,000 children and pregnant women next , year . Basil O'Connor , president of the foundation , who made the announcement yesterday at a luncheon at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel , said that the " foundation is taking a calculated risk in purchasing vaccine before it has been found effective . " However , he added , " we have every reason to hope and believe that the vaccine will be effective " . The purchase , to cost about $9,000,000 , he explained , will enable pharmaceutical manufacturers to retain specialized personnel and facilities and thus be prepared to produce promptly a substantial quantity of vaccine to be available through usual commercial channels . Before the vaccine can be placed on the market , it was pointed out , it will have to be licensed by the Laboratory of Biologics Control of the National Institute of Health , United States Public Health Service , Washington . The scientific evaluation to determine the effectiveness of the vaccine , said to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is now being carried out at the University of Michigan under the direction of Dr. Thomas Francis Jr. , worldfamous epidemiologist . The results are not expected to be known until about April 1 . The vaccine purchased by the National Foundation , Mr. O'Connor said , will be made available to all children who participated in the field trials this year and did not receive the vaccine , to pregnant women and to the chil- , dren who will be in the first grade of school next year . Thus , he pointed out , if the vaccine is licensed , these highly susceptible groups would be offered protec tion before the next polio season . If the evaluation of the vaccine shows it to be effective in protecting against paralytic polio , Mr , O'Connor said , the six pharmaceutical houses producing the vaccine will have enough to vaccinate 9,000,000 additional persons , and could meet a demand to protect up to one-half of the 60,000,000 of the age group up to sixteen years . The foundation has contracted to purchase 25,000,000 cubic centimeters ( about 25,000 quarts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters now on hand from the nation wide vaccine trials , will provide 9,000,000 vaccinations of three " shots " each . The price paid by the foundation is $1 for three " shots " , said to be the cost of production . The 9,000,000 injections , Mr. O'Connor said , will be made avail . able , free , to the following groups : 1,390,000 children who participated in the tests this year , who received only an inactive injection or were not vaccinated at all ; an estimated 4,275,000 women expected to become prep nant between April 1 and Sept. 30 ; and 4,825,000 children in the first grade of school next year , While these add up to 10,490,000 , only 75 per cent of the total could be expected to ask for the vaccine , Mr. O'Connor said . The vaccine program , he added , is one of four big programs to be undertaken by the foundation in 1955 . These , he said , will require a gross total of $64,000,000 to be raised in next January 's March of Dimes . Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pointed out , polio cases must be expected in 1955 . Not only will there be thousands of patients from previous years who depend upon the national foundation for financial assistance , but also new patients . " We must be prepared to assist approximately the same number of patients in 1955 as in 1954 , " he said . " Therefore we shall need $29,900,000 to take care of patients , new and old . " The Emergency March of Dimes , held Aug. 16-31 , raised half of the $20,000,000 needed for 1954 commitments , it was reported . The foundation was able to cut back its gamma globulin purchases by $4,000,000 , leaving $6,000,000 due on that commitment , which is included in the $64,000,000 to be raised . Other needs include $2,700,000 for scientific research , $2,900,000 for professional education , $2 , 300,000 for respirator and treatment centers , $6,200,000 for assistance to chapters , public information , medical treatment services and administration at headquarters and 3,100 chapters , and $6,000,000 still due on 1954 gamma globulin contracts .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
