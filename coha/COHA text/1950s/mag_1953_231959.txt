THE DARK ISLAND ( 312 pp. ) - Henry Treece-Random House ( $3 ) . <P> <P> As if to muffle the din of the Thermo-Nuclear Age , some British authors in the last 16 months have pulled the blanket of history over their heads and burrowed in the warm , dark bed of the past . H.F.M. Prescott 's The Man on a Donkey was a skillfully done period piece about England under Henry VIII . In The Golden Hand , Edith Simon told a leisurely tale about an English cathedral town and the faith that sustained it ( 14th century ) . In The Little Emperors , Alfred Duggan made diverting entertainment out of the fall of the Roman Empire in Britain ( sth century ) . Now , in an almost equally engaging yarn , Henry Treece reaches back to the time ( ist century ) when the Romans had just conquered Britain-an era when proper Britons worshipped the sun and painted blue marks on their foreheads to show their rank . <P> Author Treece 's is the story of how Rome clamped the vise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the eyes of the losing side . Caradoc , proud and restive young King of the Belgae , dreams of uniting all the tribes of Britain and driving the Roman occupation forces , left by Caesar , into the sea . But the Picts , the Cantii , the Iceni , jealous of their individual little sovereignties , do not want to be united . Caradoc decides to go it alone with his Belgae . The Emperor Claudius himself limps ashore , and in two decisive battles , the short Roman swords cut the Belgae down to serf-size . Fleeing west and hiding out for years , Caradoc is finally betrayed by rival tribesmen , and ends his days under a kind of villa arrest in Rome . <P> Author Treece 's story , which gallops along at the pace of a western movie , is full of soothsayers , blood oaths and hoary legends . Its best scenes catch the rude vigor of the times , e.g. , the annual ceremony of a human sacrifice to the sun god , in which a red-haired youth chosen by the druids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' surprise weapon , a cavalry of elephants and camels , stampeding the horses of the Celtic charioteers into snorting , neighing chaos . <P> The Dark Island poses an interesting question for Author Treece 's writing colleagues : Are there any earlier British sagas that remain to be told , short of the Piltdown man ?
