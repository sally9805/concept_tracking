A bug that flaps and stings , Manhattan 's Communist Daily Worker raises the biggest welts when assisted by its enemies . Thanks to such help last week from an army that advanced too quickly and a general who retreated too easily-the Worker raised a big welt . It had smeared a Republican candidate for Congress right off the ballot . Brigadier General Elliott R. Thorpe ( ret . ) , General MacArthur 's wartime counter-intelligence chief ) announced that he was " shocked and depressed , " and as a result withdrew as a Republican candidate for Congress from Rhode Island . <P> A year ago , before General Thorpe was nominated , the Daily Worker picked up a speech he had made before the Rhode Island Turkey Growers and Poultry Growers Association . The Worker distorted the speech to make it sound as if he were supporting the Communist party line on the Far East . Agents of the Army 's Counter-intelligence Corps ( which Thorpe himself helped organize in the Pacific ) descended on his home town of Westerly , R.I. , a small community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors and friends about his loyalty . The agents based the questions on the Worker 's version of Thorpe 's speech . Instead of standing his ground , Thorpe withdrew as a candidate for fear he would embarrass his party . Last week the Army announced there was no question of Thorpe 's loyalty and wrote to him apologizing for " the unfortunate inconvenience and embarrassment . " But by that time the damage was done .
