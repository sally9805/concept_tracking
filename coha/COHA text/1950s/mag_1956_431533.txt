@#  | It 's Easy to be the Parents of the Groom On the night your son gets you out of bed to tell you he 's engaged , you 'll feel some rather mixed emotions . You 'll be happy and thrilled because he 's happy and thrilled . You 'll be a bit apprehensive because he 's " so young . " ( All sons and daughters are " so young " when they decide to marry . ) You 'll he secretly pleased at the prospect of a wedding . And then , if this is your first experience along these lines , you 'll begin to wonder just exactly what you 're supposed to do . Actually the parents of the groom have all the fun of the wedding with very little of the responsibility . But a few questions of etiquette will almost certainly arise , and since you 'll naturally be eager to play your role to perfection , you 'll want to have the answers at your finger tips . The Question of a Call If you live anywhere within visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband should call on them within a few days after you 've learned the good news . It does n't matter whether they are close friends or people you 've never met ; this visit , which indicates your approval of the marriage , is your responsibility . So do n't wait for an invitation , but telephone the bride 's mother and ask whether it would be convenient for you and your husband to call some weekday evening or Sunday afternoon ( or any time that the men of both families are available ) . Of course if the bride 's family lives three states away , an immediate call is probably out of the question . In that case you should write a warm letter of welcome to your daughterin-law-to-be ( usually inviting her to visit you as soon as she can ) and a cordial note to her mother saying that you 're looking forward to meeting her and her husband . Even if you have never met your son 's fiancee . it 's nice to express approval . For example , you might say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know we 're going to love Marian . "  | The Question of an Engagement Present Engagement presents are always entirely optional , but a little gift of some sort is a very charming way to make the bride-to-be feel that you are happy about your son 's choice . Of course you may buy her something small ( engagement presents are seldom large or lavish ) , but if you have a pretty little family heirloom ? a small piece of jewelry or silver ? it 's particularly gracious to give her that , with an explanation that it " belonged to John 's greatgrandmother " or " was one of my own wedding presents . " The Question of a Party It is n't necessary , but the chances are that if it 's feasible you 'll want to entertain for your son 's fiancee . This can take the form of almost any sort of party you like . You may want to make it a tea to introduce your future daughter-in-law to your friends . or you may prefer a cocktail party %here you have an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two families is perfectly proper and a nice way to get better acquainted . Or if your budget can stand it , you may want to play host at a fairly formal bridal dinner for the whole wedding party . There are just three kinds of party that the groom 's parents can not have for the bride ? her announcement party and her wedding reception , which are traditionally given by her parents , and a shower , which neither your family nor hers should give . The Question of Invitations As the weeks of the engagement pass . you 'll find that you and the bride 's ( Continued on page 166 ) @# 166 mother have a number of things to confer about . When the bride and her family have decided just how large the wedding and reception are to be , the bride 's mother will ask you for a list of friends of your family whom you 'd like to have invited . And here a little special consideration is in order . Technically your family is entitled to half the total guest list . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you may certainly feel free to ask as many people as you like to the church . But remember that each guest at the reception adds to the cost of the party , and since the bride 's family pays all the expenses of the affair , it 's a good idea to try to keep your list of guests down to not more than a third of the total . It 's also a great help if you give the bride 's mother your list , either typed or very legibly written , with complete names ( no initials ) and addresses , as promptly as possible . The Question of What to Wear Naturally you 'll want to wear the prettiest , most becoming dress you have or can find . ( If you already own something suitable , there 's no reason why you should n't wear it . ) But remember that your costume will be on display beside others in the receiving line and should harmonize with them both in degree of formality and in color . So it 's best to take your cue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length dress to wear and whether to wear a hat , etc. , even if her choice is not exactly what yours would have been . The Question of WeddingDay Procedure On the wedding day itself you and your husband are guests of honor . At the church you and he are seated in the front pew on the right-hand side , just before the bride 's mother is seated , and escorted out immediately after she is . At the reception you ( and your husband , if the bride wishes ) stand in the receiving line and meet every guest . And if a sit-down meal is served , you are placed at the " parents ' table " with the bride 's mother and father and often the clergyman and his wife . Your only two obligations are to be prompt at the church and to have a wonderful time at the reception . The Question of Expenses When it comes to the matter of money , you can rejoice that it 's your son and not your daughter who is being married ! As parents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pay for whatever costumes you wear ; and if you come to the wedding from out of town , you 'll have railroad fare and perhaps a hotel bill . And of course you 'll want to give the bride and groom the nicest present you can afford or the biggest check you can manage . But beyond that you will have no expenses , and you can dance at your son 's wedding without worries about paying the piper . THE END @#
