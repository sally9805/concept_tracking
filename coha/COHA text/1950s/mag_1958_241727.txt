From the gin mills of Tijuana and the cotton gins of Mexicali , a green stain of prosperity is spreading south from the U.S. border through Mexico 's newest state , Baja California Norte ( the 29th , established in 1951 ) . Along the northern half of the mountain-spined peninsula , water is flowing from new wells through new irrigation ditches , turning deserts where the Colorado enters the Gulf of California into fields of cotton , plots of tomatoes and the purple traceries , of grapevines . Mexican and U.S. farmers , industrialists and businessmen are laying out factories , hotels , lawns , streets and truck gardens with assembly-line speed . The citizens of Baja California ( estimated pop . 550,000 ) proudly argue that the new state 's standard of living is Mexico 's best , a boast bolstered by the fact that its minimum legal wage is the country 's highest . <P> Throne Room . Baja California 's economic importance lies in the northern one-tenth of the 780-mile-long appendix , in the area between Mexicali , the capital , on the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is king there , and Mexicali , its population nearly tripled ( more than 160,000 ) in five years , is its prosperous throne room . It has U.S.-style real-estate developments , with hundreds of houses in the $10,000-to-$1 5,000 class . Last year 55 gins , six cottonseed-oil mills and four compresses-the world 's biggest concentration of ginning facilities-swallowed the 400,000-bale output of the 1,650-square-mile Mexicali valley , brought in more than $68 million . <P> Mexicali 's cotton prosperity is the offspring of a convenient marriage of U.S. capitalism and Mexican socialism . Between 1936 and 1938 President Lazaro Cardenas expropriated foreign-held cotton land in the valley , doled it out to Mexican peasants . Too poor to buy seed , fertilizer and equipment , the farmers turned to the Mexican subsidiary of the giant U.S. firm of Anderson , Clayton &; Co. , which branched out from ginning into financing the growers . Since 1939 , production has climbed ten times . <P> Fleshpots &; Long Shots . The contribution of Tijuana ( pop . 140,000 ) to the new prosperity is , as always , tourist dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the arched gates at the border , dropped an estimated $70 million at the Hipdromo de Tijuana race track and in curio shops , restaurants , hotels and brothels . Tijuana also boasts flourishing new residential sections of costly ( $20,000 to $25,000 ) houses . <P> Down a good highway , 67 miles south of Tijuana , Ensenada ( pop . 35,000 ) closes Baja California 's boom triangle . Shucking off the maana tradition , Ensenada laborers are working seven days a week to finish a $15 million deepwater port , a $3,500,000 cement factory and acres of new houses . Close to 4,000 workers are employed catching , cleaning and canning plentiful white sea bass , sardines , rock lobsters . A new cannery packs tomatoes and chili peppers grown on farms to the south . White-painted boats chug in and out of the harbor , carrying the guests of 44 new motels to sport-fishing grounds .
