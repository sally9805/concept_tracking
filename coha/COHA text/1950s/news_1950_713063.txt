txt BIG CORPORATIONS probably will have their tax bills hiked if Congress enacts ? new tax law  --  despite the reluctance of the senators to slap bigger burdena on business . With the Korean crania , there 's more reap ? son to believe the Senate will go along with a corporate tax increase . The fighting in the Far Mist adds to the pressure for bigger government spending and higher taxes . If the situation worsens greatly . Congress might , of course . junk all proposed tax cuts and hike taxes much higher . Meantime . the senators are under other pressures to raise big company taxes . The business boom has Congress and the Administration thinking larger corporations can afford to pay more taxes . The senators . even more than House members , yearn to give small concern a tax cut , and they ca n't do that without taking more from the big boys . And lastly , the House-passed tax bill is tailored to make it easy for the Senate to " compromise . " ? . . THE HOUSE VOTED to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all above that at 41% . The maximum rate now is 311% . The House schedule would not change taxes for companies . earning up to $5,000 a year . Concerns getting from 35.000 to $164,667 would have their taxes cut , to the tune of $273 million a year . But corporations earning over 3166,667 would pay $708 million more a year  --  a net gain for Uncle Sam of over $400 million annually . There 's a good chance the Senate may vote a smaller increase  --  the tax would be 21% on the first 325.000 of income and 39e1 on all above that The net effect of this would be a slight loss to the government . The smaller companies would get ? tax cut of more than $275 million . and the increase for upper bracket companies would n't quite make that uP . A top 39% rate would lead to more horsetrading when House-Senate conferees draft a final measure . The Senate could go up one percentage point and the House could come down one , to agree on 40 ? e . EMPLOYERS DO N'T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for New York State 's new disability insurance . Employes wo n't like it either . Neither will folks in other states having similar disability laws , since they 'll presumably be affected . too . New York 's new law . effective July-1. requires that 5aS withhold igrora their workers one-half 's of ' 1% of their paychecks. but no more than 30 cents a week . This , along with a contribution-from " the employer . will be kept in an insurance fund to pay workers when they 're ill or disabled . Some employers prefer to pay the workers ' contrioution out of their own pockets . But the federal Treasury has ruled that when they do this , they must withhold federal income taxes on the amounts paid and the traployes must include the payments in their tax returns as added pay . That will mean a lot of complicated accounting for employers who will have to figure withheld taxes on very small amounts ? unless the Commerce le Industry Association of New York succeeds in its drive to get the Treasury to change the ruling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their bosses . Under the New York plan , an employer may turn his own and his workers ' contributions over to the state and let it handle the insurance payments . or he may arrange a plan with a private insurance company , or he may keep tale money himself and set up his own insurance fund . Disability payments  --  they 'll range from $10 to $26 for a Maximum of 13 weeks  --  are tax free . Employes do n't have to report them on their tax returns . If the payments come from the state or from an insurance company , there will be no question about taxes . But if the boss himself handles the insurance . that may be another matter . Some employers have always paid full wages to ill or disabled workers , especially those who have long service . If an employer who handles his own insurance fund pays a disabled worker his regular salary , can part of this now be considered a tax-free disability payment ? Can the worker deduct from his taxable income the amount he 's entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been getting a regular $50 paycheck from the boss every week . Now he 's entitled to $26 a week disability for 10 weeks , which the boss gives him , along with the remaining $24 a week . Can the worker deduct that $26 on his tax return ? ? THE TREASURY HAS N'T ruled on this point yet , but the answer appears to be " yes . " The logic of the ' situation suggests an affirmative answer and a recent special ruling by the Bureau of Internal Revenue to the Armed Services supports it . Many veterans are entitled on retirement either to nontaxable disability pay or to larger but taxable pensions . If a veteran elects the larger amount , he might lose in the long run after taxes . The Bureau has ruled in effect that a veteran choosing the pension can deduct from it for tax purposes the amount to which he would be entitled " for disability . Government experts say the important factor in the disability insurance question seems to be that the worker has a right to the payment and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an employer can make his weekly payment to the disabled worker in one check . He wo n't have ' to make out one from the disability fund and one from himself to , make up-. the rest of the week 's wages . But . pending a ruling , Internal Revenue Bureau men suggest- that employers  --  if they handle their own disability funds and include disability in a worker 's regular weekly pay  - -  either stamp or write on each check how much represents disability insurance .
