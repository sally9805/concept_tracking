Subsequent American grain ships were properly safeguarded , but the people of Sarkhan continued to believe that Russia was their friend and provider . About a month after the grain incident Ambassador Louis Krupitzyn made his first report to Moscow . He wrote a long letter telling Moscow that the Communist activities and programswere progressing ahead of schedule in Sarkhan . The report went into details of every activity of the Communists ' coordinated effort , discussing the cultural , economic , political , religious , and military aspects of Russia 's struggle to acquirepower in Sarkhan . Near the end of his report were two short but interesting comments . " The American Ambassador is a jewel . He keeps his people tied up with meetings , social events , and greeting and briefing the scores of senators , congressmen , generals , admirals , undersecretariesof State and Defense , and so on , who come pouringthrough here to look for themselves .

" I note with concern , however , that the American press has been very critical of Ambassador Sears for his inability to counter the tricks we played on him with the grain ships . If these American press attacks continue , it is possible that in time he will be removed . It is to our advantage to have him remain here . Therefore , during the next week or two I will sec to it that editorials in the local newspapers will praise him for being an understanding American and a brave fighter . I also suggest that Pravda attack him bitterly . This combina  --  40  --  Lucky , Lucky Lou #2tion will be all that is necessary to convince the U. S. State Department and the U.

In 1952 Father Finian was ordered to Burma with the positions of Overseer of Catholic Missions and Advocate for the General of the Society of Jesus . As Father Finian read the document which ordered him from comfortable New England ten thousand miles to Burma , he smiled with satisfaction.  --  43  --  The Ugly AmericanFather Finian was a big man  --  six foot three inches ; perhaps from hunching forward to listen to smaller men , he had developed a stoop . His hands were big ; and although they were now smooth , they still looked strong . When he was a boy he had delivered ice , hauled crates at the Railroad Express , picked over tons of coal looking for the grey gleam of slate ; when he was at Oxford he had rowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke they had ever had . A man knowing the frailness of all men , Father Finian welcomedthe assignment to Burma . Although he enjoyed the scholarship of religion , and knew , calmly and without arrogance , that he was considered a promising intellectual among members of the Society of Jesus , the priest felt that a special task awaited him in Asia . With an intensity that was almost physical , he wanted to grapple with it . He knew of the terrible trouble there , the political plague which infected people who were susceptible because of hunger , poverty , or political disunity . The memory of his own experience with this political plague was bright in his mind , each detail perfect and precise . It had happened during the war when he was a Navy chaplain . He had been talking to combat-seasoned Marines who were gathered on a small hill in the Russell Islands . Below them , framed in the coconut palms and the white crescent of sand , were the blue-grey hulks of the LCI 's which would take them into battle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the priest with unusual interest . He stood quietly with his lips barely parted and his head turned so as to catch every word . Finian became more enthusiastic than usual . He talked volubly of dedication to  --  44  --  Nine FriendsGod , of the need for humility , and of the assurance of everlastinglife if one but had faith . When he had finished , filled with more emotion than he usually allowed himself , he walked quickly around the group to the attentive Marine . " May God go with you on this in-vasion . " The boy jerked his head up sharply , almost startled . The priest thought for a moment that he might be a Protestant and was embarrassed at the attentions of a Catholic . Then the Marine spat , coolly and arrogantly . Finian realizedthat he had misjudged everything . The boy 's eyes were cold and hard ; and he spoke from a tight-lipped mouth . " There is n't any God that 's going to watch me or anyone else on that LCI , father . You know it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the chaplain 's gold cross . " I 'm a Communist , father . And I 'll go into that goddamnedmiserable island and chew hell out of those Japs .. . but not for you or those fat-assed Rotarians back in the States , but because Communism is worth it . " " My son , Communism . . . . " " What you ought to be telling us , father , is why we have n't opened a second front . Tell us why a bunch of greedy capitalists do n't want to go into Europe until Soviet Russia is bled white . Do n't tell us about a make-believe god . He wo n't help . We have to help ourselves . " The hard-faced boy looked older , wiser , infinitely tougher than any man Finian had met before ; he was utterly beyond the appeal of words or logic or sentiment . Father Finian had never forgotten that incident . He had rccognized that the zeal in the boy 's eyes and the dedication  --  45  --  The Ugly Americanin his face were what made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something evil . After that meeting with the Marine , the priest oriented his energy . He began to read Communist literature . At first he merely read the speeches of Stalin and Bulganin and Zhukov as they were reported in the press , puzzling over their vulgarity , obviousness , and lack of subtlety . Their illogicality pained so well-trained a Jesuit as Father Finian ; but apparently to millions of people the logic was flawless , the appeal intense . Slowly the priest concluded that these Communist speeches were a form of secular ritual . The crude slogans were only symbols which meant much to the converted ; the incredible promises of an abundant future were as real to them as the Stations of the Cross to a Catholic . Finian learned that the faith of a Communist was no more shaken by news of a bloody purge of " right-wing deviationists " than is the faith of a Catholic by the news that the Inquisition was brutal . The discovery was decisive . The priest realized that here was the face of the devil . The Communists had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enthusiasm of the Church . There was the same emphasis upon training , the same apostolic energy , the necessity to see beyond facts to a greater truth . The only difference was that the Communists served evil . They served it so well that the priest knew that both faiths could not exist in this world at the same time . Later he read Lenin 's What is to be Done ? and Stalin 's History of the Communist Party , Engels ' Anti-Duhring , and finally , Marx 's Das Kapital , and much more . Through all the tedious reading through economics and politics , sociology and philosophy , the priest never wavered . Others might think  --  46  --  Nine Friendsthat Communism was a result of class conflict , of ' ing-aiige economic change or political fanaticism ; but Finian knew that Communism was the face of the devil , altered slyly and shrewdly , but still the devil 's face , put on earth to test again the morality of men . Finian meant to meet the test , even if he had to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thoughtful man . When he left for Burma he was well-armed . On his long trip via Manila , Saigon , Bangkok , and finally Rangoon , he crystallizedhis plan of attack . During his two-week stay in Rangoon and his journey up a thousand miles of the Irrawaddy River by slow launch , he studied the Burmans and reviewed his notes on the culture , the history , and anthropology of the country . There was nothing haphazard about Finian . Because of the Burmese heat , the windows in the residence of the Archbishop of Mokthu had no glass . Instead they were covered by fine wire screens ; at night , bamboo shades were lowered inside to assure privacy . Looking through the screens Finian saw many strange insects pressed against the wire mesh . Beyond the bodies of the insects , which by some trick of the eye seemed to fill the middle distance , Finian saw the lush green rolling of the Mokthu Valley . At the edge of Mokthu Town the tin shacks , the roads , the tiny streams of sewage ended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed as if the town balanced at the very edge of survival ; and that at any moment the eternal , powerful , lazy jungle might come sweeping over the town and bury it like a soft and tropical Pompeii . " I should like to get out into the country soon , " the priest  --  47  --  The Ugly Americansaid , quietly . " I would appreciate whatever help you can give me . A jeep perhaps ; a tent , a sleeping hammock , some food . " " You are going to stay out for more than a night ? " asked the Archbishop . " Yes . For a few months . " " Father , we have closed our three missions between here and China . The Communists burned one and threw phosphorousbombs into the other two . It is impossible to stay out there . " " Nevertheless , can you assist me ? " " Yes , " the Archbishop said , stiffly . " If that is what you must do . " " With your permission , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For three months . " Then , because he could not resist it , he added , " Nothing is really impossible . " At once he felt a stab of guilt , for he had said it only to bait the Archbishop . Finian drove north , bumping and slithering along the narrowcart road through the jungle . He knew he had to do three things very quickly . First , he had to find at least one native Catholic who was courageous . Second , he had to learn the language . Third , he had to learn to eat the food .. . which meant he might have to endure several weeks of agonizing dysentery while his intestinal tract developed an immunity to the bacteria in the native food . Five weeks later Finian stood under a fir tree in the tropical jungle of the area where the Kachin plateau joins the mountains of Assam . The giant tree flung itself out of the steam and smell and heat of the jungle floor toward the clean , in  --  48  --  Nine Friendsfinitely removed , asceptic blue-whiteness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three basic tasks . He still had a fever from the dysentery , and he was forty pounds lighter . His face was white and sweated , as if his vitality had been leached out of his flesh . His bowels were tender and painful . When he moved , his viscera came together with a roughness that was incredibly painful . His tongue was dry from fever , and his teeth felt chalky . His bones ached , and once , in his delirium , he had imagined that the marrow had been replaced by gelatin . But he could eat native food ; at that very moment his overtenderintestines were digesting two handfuls of rice , half of a mango , and a cup of very impure water . He knew that he would keep it down . He was immune . Finian had also learned the language . He had chewed into it like a cold chisel driven into granite . From the first day in the up-country he spoke nothing but Burmese . He asked the name of every object he saw , by pointing at it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk , hop , jump , down , sideways , lizard , river , sea , cloud , yes , no , fire , food , feet , nose , mouth . . . he was astonished at how few were the essential words of a language . Even while he was sick with dysentery he practiced . The grammar came quite unconsciously ; and in four weeks he was speaking simple sentences . He made no effort to learn complexor difficult expressions . He wanted complex needs to be put in simple sentences and was convinced it could be done . His Burmese was the only way he could search for dependable associates . After he had found the first Burmese Catholic , it had been less difficult to find other good men . He had not required that they be Catholic ; only that they be anti-Communist and that  --  49  --  The Ugly Americanthey be honest and have courage . " Come to think of it , " Finian said to himself , " that was asking quite a bit . " He pushed himself away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But pain or no pain , it was necessary for him to be standing when his eight new associates arrived . He thought for a moment of the difficulties he had had recruiting them . All his training as a Jesuit , all his alertness , every availabletrick and wile had been necessary ; and he had had to look for them while he was still miserably sick . The main problem had been finding the first one , a Burman who was surely and beyond mistake a dependable man . His name was U Tien . U Tien was a jeep driver on the staff of the Archbishop , and had been ordered to go with the priest . His home was in the north , in the mountains about fifty miles from the Chinese border . This was the area where the priest had decided to work . U Tien was thirty-nine years old , married , had three children and said that he was a devout Catholic . He said it evenly , without fervor ; and Finian felt he was telling the truth . But still he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U Tien while he went away on a short trip . Later , when he examined the briefcase , the thin almost invisible thread which he had twisted through the clasp was unbroken . So he knew , as a minimum , that U Tien was honest . Secondly , he had told U Tien that he was thinking of negotiatingwith the Communists so that they would allow the mission schools to reopen . Finian had told him that they could re-open the schools on the condition that they would not teach anything against the Communists . U Tien 's face showed  --  50  --  Nine Friendsno expression . Finian went on to say that Communism was politics and Catholicism was religion and there was no reason why they should conflict . Good Burmans could be good Communists as well as good Catholics , he said . There had been much misunderstanding ; it was possible to be a good patriot and a good Communist and a good Catholic . What , he asked , did U Tien think of this ? Agony showed in U Tien 's eyes . Finian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Intuitively they say what they think their listener wants to hear . Finian also knew that a Communist would have hesitated , played for time until he could check with higher authority on what he should say . For what Finian was proposing was a capitulation . U Tien wet his lips . " I think it would be a mistake , " he said , and his voice was low and dejected . " I think it would not be possible to be a good Catholic and a good Communist . Somehow , in some way that I can not tell you clearly , they are not things that can be mixed . " He paused , seeking for the right words . " To say it differently : if one way is right , then the other can not be . That is the best I can put it . I am sorry . " There had been other tests . Some of them were slight and quick , some more deliberate . Finally Father Finian had done what he knew was a cruel thing , but necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shopped industriously for a leather pouch . He had asked for such a pouch at four shops , and at each he had said , " It must be stout enough to hold a pistol and fifty rounds of ammunition . I want it for my driver so that he can guard the jeep in these troubled days . "  --  51  --  The Ugly AmericanThe next day U Tien had been late for work . When he appeared , driving the jeep , his face was covered with a long purple welt that ran across his eye and down to his lower jaw . Blood was crusted in the corners of his mouth . Finian asked him what had happened . " The Communists came last night and beat me , " he said . " They thought I had a pistol and ammunition . They said they knew it for a fact . They almost destroyed my room searchingfor it . " He paused and his eyes were bewildered and angry . " You have not been wise in what you have said , sir . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment Finian dropped his air of innocence . " It will not happen again , U Tien , " he said , placing his hand on the man 's shoulder . " This is the end of a time of testing . Now we know one another . It was necessary because there are spies everywhere . I had to find one man with whom I can trust God 's work . Now , find out who the spies are . " Within a week U Tien told him . And he also told him who the dependable men were . Some of the dependable men were not Catholics , but they hated the Communists ; and U Tien told him the reasons in each case . " Now , " said the priest , " we will start our work . " Four men , U Tien among them , came flitting through the trees , nodded at Finian , and stood quietly in front of him . They waited without talking ; and in a few minutes four more men appeared . All nine of them crouched to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole work and training of years comes to a point , as if one had worked endlesslyon a nail and now , with a few blows , were trying it  --  52  --  Nine Friendson tough wood . He felt calm . His physical weakness was enormous , a pervading and maddening softness . But the weaknesswas only something of the body , something that would yield before food and sleep and exercise . Otherwise he was strong . He closed his eyes for a moment , asked for guidance so that his strength would not be misused , and then , opening his eyes , began to talk very slowly to the eight Burmans . " This thing is hard to say , " he began slowly , speaking the words he had distilled down from twelve years of work . " But it must be said . " He paused . " In usual times the Church cares not what the State does . Each is concerned with different parts of man : one with his soul and the other with his political life . A great saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church is left free to fight sin , it will do nothing to tarnish the sword of the State . " He hesitated , wondering if St. Augustine would quite approvethis way of putting it . " But these are not usual times . The men calling themselves Communists say that the soul and the state are identical . The price of being a Communist is that you must also give them your soul and your will . They are trying to make themselves gods on this earth . " They were listening intently . These men had lived long with the threat of violence and death just at their back . They could not be deceived by soft words . They would recognize the truth , even if it were hard . " The first thing is that we must decide very surely and exactly what it is we want . Before we make the smallest move we must agree on that , " Finian said . And then he asked them , with absolute openness , " What is it that we wish to do ? "  --  53 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing , a thin tense shred of silence . About each of the men there was a tautness , an expectation that was almost palpable . " Tell us what is to be done ? " U Piu asked . He did not look up . Finian knew that this was a critical moment , a point of balance . U Piu , he sensed , was testing him . " It is not for me to say , " Finian said flatly . " It is for all of us . It is your country , your souls , your lives . I will do what we agree upon . " Subtly , so subtly that it was beyond the capacity of the eye to tell what was happening , the line of men seemed to become straighter , more firm . Their backs went straighter , their hands stopped playing with twigs and pieces of dirt ; they looked up at Finian . The tiny invisible things that make up a posture of decisiveness , Finian could not detect . He only knew that it had happened . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these men had ever been told by a white man that a big and important decision was entirely their own ... and would be followed by the white man . " The big thing ? That is what we must name ? " one of the men said softly , his mind revolving around the question . " The big thing we want is that all of our people become Catholics . " A few of the Burmans looked at Finian for his reaction , but his face was impassive . His pain had come back , but no expression crossed his face . He was taller and more clumsy than any of the Burmans , and he knew it was important that he crouch as they did . " No , that is not the final big thing we want , " U Tien said . He spoke slowly , reaching carefully for the right words . " I  --  54Nine Friendsdo not care if there are Buddhists or Anamists among us . Or if there are Methodists or Baptists , or even nonbelievers . Beforethe Communists came there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worship the way I wanted or to raise my children in my faith . But the Communists have made all worship impossible except the worship of Stalin , Lenin , Mao . In the areas the Communists control everyone must believe in one single thing : Communism . " Again there was a moment of silence , as the men thought of what had been said . " U Tien is right , " one of the Burmans said . " I too am a Catholic , but I do not require that all of us be Catholics . What this means , I think , is that the thing we want is a countrywhere any man can worship any god he wishes ; where he can live the way his heart says . That , I think , is the final big thing . " There was some more discussion , some of it heated . Once or twice the Burmans looked at Finian , but he merely stared back at them . Finally they came to agreement and they fell silent . . . their silence indicating their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will sum up what you have said , " Finian said . " The important thing , the big thing , is a country where any man may worship and live as he wishes . " Then he added , humbly , " It is not my right to approve or disapprove , but I agree with you . " The Burmans ' faces lighted , and the tiny wet clearing rang with laughter . U Piu , who was more exuberant than most Burmans , smacked his hands together with pleasure . Finian , for the first time in five weeks , was unaware of the sullen pain of dysentery.  --  55  --  The Ugly American " Now , the next step is harder , more difficult to think through , " he said quietly . " It calls for great honesty and much information and much thought . It is this : Why do we not now have the freedom to worship or live as we please ? Why is this ? " " Because the Communists do not permit it , " one of the men said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they beat men who follow the politics of U Nu ; they ridicule confession and confirmation . The Communists deny us all freedoms . " " But why do Burmans believe what the Communists say ? " Finian asked quietly . " Once the Communists were only a few . Now they are many and they control many areas . They are Burmans like you . It means nothing to say Communists deny us freedom . Why do we allow them to deny us the freedom ? " " Mostly because many of our people believe in what they say , " U Piu answered . " But why ? " Finian asked stubbornly , and his posture made it clear he would not attempt the answers . The argument became so heated that Finian could not alwaysfollow it . Several times one or more of the men were angry . One man , Toki , who was a withdrawn and silent man , stood up , walked over to a tree , and pulled off a branch in his hands as if the intensity of what he felt could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild , loud talk Finian could tell that there was a pride and a sharp sense of discovery . Finally the talk quieted . Then men looked at U Tien as if he were their spokesman . " What we think . . . and the words may offend you , Father . . . is three things , " U Tien said slowly . the Communists can deny us freedom because many Burmans have  --  56  --  Nine Friendsbecome Communists ( 4Sec many Burmans have become Communists because they think that the Communists are against the white man . . . the Westerner . I apologize , Father , for saying this . It is hard , but most of us feel that the white man has not always been just . It is a hard thing , but it is tru hirdl , many Burmans are for the Communists because they think the Communists will do good things for the people ... for the peasants and cheap-pay workers . Give us land and more food and maybe automobiles and radios and cheap medicine . That , we agree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worship . " " That seems to me sound and true , " Finian said , as if he were merely summing up their statement . " First , that what we want is freedom to worship and to live . Secondly , that we will not have that freedom again until many Burmans stop being Communists ; and they will only escape when they realize that Communism is evil for all . I am sure in my own mind that the Communists care nothing about white men or brown men or black men , but only for power . But you must not take my word for any of this . Together we will look at the facts and see what we discover . " He paused and his teeth came together sharply from the pain . " Tomorrow , if you wish , we will meet again at the same time and will read together what the Communists say they want and how they go about getting it , " Finian said . " We will read and find this from things that the Communists themselves write and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will have the truth and will know what we must do . " He stood up and the pain was suddenly so great that he felt he would faint . His face paled and the beads of sweat broke out on his face and rolled with a salt taste into his mouth.  --  57  --  The Ugly AmericanU Tien made a movement toward him , a quick gesture of support , but Finian shook his head . He slowly shook hands with each of the men and thanked them for coming . The next afternoon the Burman were back . This time they were eager to talk , full of enthusiasm and words . They had thought since they left and they were , in a quiet way , desperate to communicate their views . " Father , before we do anything we must have all the information that it is possible to have about the Communists in this area , I think , " one of the Burmans said . " It is right to know what we want in a faraway day , but first we must know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back a smile of excitement . What the Burmans were proposing was exactly what Finian was going to propose as the third step : the gathering of intelligence . The rest of the Burmans nodded agreement . Eagerly and in great detail they began to disclose the extent of local Communistpower . They told of merchants who were secret Communists , revealed which students were leaders , and which democrats , who were propaganda carriers , where the arms were cached , the extent of guerilla warfare . They talked steadilyfor two days . They drew sketches in the ground , pointed out locations on maps . They were astonished at the extent of their knowledge and also somewhat frightened  --  for no single one among them had realized that the Communists were so powerful . There was no village which did not have a shadow apparatus of Communists , no Western organization which was not spied upon .

Elsewhere they merely propagandized endlessly on the two themes of the  --  58  --  Nine Friendsevil of the Western white man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now we know all that we can possibly know of the Communistsand we know it equally . Each of us is as informed as the rest , " Finian said . " We are not like the Communists who carefully conceal information from their people . Now we must decide what can be done . What shall we do ? " The argument raged every afternoon for two weeks . Ideas , words , enthusiasm , anger , commitment , and excitement boiled in their meetings . And finally , painfully and chaotically , agreementcame . Many months later Finian summed up in his report what they had done . By then it was possible to see things more clearly . " What we discovered , " he wrote , " is that men are persuadedof things by the same process , whether the persuading is done by the Catholic Church , Lutherans , Communists , or democrats . A movement can not be judged by its methods of persuasion for , short of violence , most successful movements use the same methods . What we discovered in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We desired a community in which choice of life and religion existed. z . But this was impossible because many Burman had been deceived into believing the Communists. 3 . Therefore , we had to demonstrate to the people that the Communists had no interest in them , but were interested only in power. q .. This had to be done skillfully , but without force . It had to be by a process of persuasion . Therefore , we had to make ourselves experts in persuasion.  --  59  --  The Ugly American5 . We had to persuade in terms of events which are known to Burmans. 6 . We had to persuade in words which would be understood by everyone. 7 . Complex ideas had to be put dramatically and powerfully. 8 . The persuasion had to be done at a time when the audience would be receptive . And it had to be done on all levels . " Once the eight Burmans had agreed on this , the rest seemed almost easy . The hardest part was the waiting and the planning . We had to wait , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , for we were only nine against three thousand active Communists . " The first thing my eight associates did was publish a small , cheap , newspaper on the ditto machine I had brought with me . They called it The Communist Farmer . This was cunning , because the title could mean anything . Initially the Communists did not know whether to support or oppose the newspaper , which appeared mysteriously and suddenly in marketplaces , stores , doorsteps , village squares , buses , and streets . In each issue there was an article by a famous Communist  --  Stalin , Marx , Lenin , Mao Tse-tung , Chou En-lai , Plekhanov . One issue had an article by Karl Marx in which he attacked the stupidity and backwardness of the peasants . Another issue offered a speech by Stalin in which he justified his slaughter of kulaks ' on the grounds that agriculture must be collectivized . The rest of the issue was a simple reporting of facts about farming difficulties in Russia , the agricultural progress in the United States , hints on how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  60  --  Nine Friends " The Communist Party was confused for only two issues . Then they attacked the paper savagely in speeches , by radio , and in other papers . They pointed out that The Communist Farmer was reporting only part of Communist theory ; but they could not effectively deny that what was reported was authoritative . They roared in their own papers that Stalin loved the peasants . But this was oddly unconvincing in the light of his murder of the kulaks . ' Within a month , the Communist press was printing almost nothing except replies to The Communist Farmer . " Then they made an all-out effort to suppress the paper . But this only made the paper more desirable , and copies be- came prized . Then they threatened to kill the men who printed and distributed it ; but here , for the first time , their espionage failed and they could never discover who we were . The Communists slowly became buffoons in the eyes of the local Burmans . People actually laughed at statements made at Communist rallies . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fierce . . . but if it is antic , it is hopeless . " Communist leaders in the northern province were re- placed . Then the new leaders were purged . . . and their replacements were in turn removed . A joke began to circulate that the quickest way to die was to be made a high official of the Communist Party . " And then the climax came . The man from Moscow ar- rived in Anthkata , a Russian expert on Burma . He was tall , wiry , hard-faced , a veteran of purges , conspiracies , plots , and counterplots . He had never failed . His name was Vinich . " Vinich had made elaborate plans before he smuggled him- self into Anthkata . He had developed a thorough plan for the extermination of The Communist Farmer . And he took steps  --  61  --  The Ugly Americanto assure that his presence in Anthkata would not be known .

And each day it advertised that on June 1o , at 2:00 p.m. , there would be a radio broadcast of great importancefrom Myitkyina with a message of importance even to non-Communists . " On June to there were few people in Anthkata , if any , who were not listening to the radio . Somehow the broadcast had become a critical event . . . everyone felt that it was important . " Promptly at 2:00 p.m. on June to the voice of the announcerstated that the following half-hour had been bought by an organization called the Burmese Educational League . Then a rough country voice , heavy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Burmans of Anthkata have been badly misled by vicious propaganda directed at Soviet Russia and the Communist Party , ' said the local voice , speaking slowly . We think that this is a bad thing . So today we are allowing the official spokesman for the Soviet Union and the Anthkata Communist Party to speak . You will hear the voice of VladimirVinich of Moscow , Soviet Russia , who is living in the  --  62  --  Nine Friendsvillage of Ton Mou in secrecy . Last week Mr. Vinich called a meeting of the local Communists to discuss what Communistpolicy in Anthkata would be . To make sure that Communism is presented fairly , we of the Burmese EducationalSociety tape-recorded that conversation ; and I am now going to play part of it for you . Communists , like everyone else , deserve to be judged by their own words , not by the words of any vicious detractors . Friends , the next voice you will hear is that of Mr. Vladimir Vinich of Moscow , Soviet Russia , speaking on Communism 's aims . ' " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorder , some static , and then a loud , harsh voice speaking excellent , but Russian-accented , Burmese . " You have been arguing for three hours and I have not spoken during that time , ' said Vinich 's somewhat tired voice . It does n't matter what 's happening here . I 'm not asking your advice . I 'm telling you the facts . . . and the only conclusions that can be drawn from those facts . First , stop talking about Russian tractors and promising we will send some here . We ca n't do it . We 've got all we can do to supply military hardwareto Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam . Second , bear down on the owners of property . Do n't talk about " socialist ownership of lands . " That only scares the peasants . Peasants are backward types . They want private property , not collective farms . Later they 'll see the necessity for common ownership , but not now . ' " What about the anti-American propaganda , Comrade ? ' a voice asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped . He was obviously at the edge of losing his temper . You push antiAmericanismso far it becomes a form of chauvinism and the Burmese begin to overlook the deficiencies of the Burmese  --  63  --  The Ugly Americangovernment . Do n't blame everything on the Americans , save some blame for the local opposition . ' " It is hard to criticize our government right now ... ' a Burmese voice said . " Of course it is , ' Vinich cut in . But you 've got to remember that the worse things are , the better they are . Lenin said that . Which means that the mulberry and rice crops have to fail here . Which means that the road transport scheme has to fail . ' " The whir of the tape-recorder grew louder , then stopped . The local Burman 's voice , innocent and almost unctuous , came up strongly . " We are sure you are grateful for hearing about the principles and standards of Communism and the Russians ' plans for Anthkata from a high Russian spokesman , ' the voice said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe in the silly lies which enemies spread about Communism . ' " A day after the broadcast the nine men met in the jungle clearing again . For the first time Toki did not tear at small pieces of twig . He was a fulfilled man and he laughed softly at the joking remarks made by his friends . " What we must do now is to make the same effort in other provinces in Burma , " Toki said firmly . " And beyond Burma also . In Sarkhan , for example , the trouble is beginning . Their language is almost the same as ours . We can show them how to fight the enemy before the enemy is too strong to conquer . " IIe turned and looked at Father Finian . He was n't looking at him for approval . Toki and his friends had made their own  --  64  --  Nine Friendsdecision and their own way . The look which Toki gave was one of friendship and equality . Father Finian felt a flush of pleasure . The pain in his bowels had finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarkhan and hoping that the food was not too much different from that of Burma . Before leaving Burma , Father Finian added a paragraph to his personal diary . " It is reassuring to learn that what is humaneand decent and right for people is also attractive to them , " he wrote . " The evil of Communism is that it has masked from native peoples the simple fact that it intends to ruin them . When Americans do what is right and necessary , they are also doing what is effective . "  --  65  --  4Everybody LovesJoe BingThe best authority on Father Finian 's Burma trip was Ruth Jyoti , the editor and publisher of the Setkya Daily Herald , one of the finest independent papers of SoutheastAsia . It was Ruth who first heard and broke the story of Finian 's adventure , and who made a month 's trip into Northern Burma to document it . Ruth Jyoti was a most unusual Eurasian . Her fair skin and blonde hair were Anglo-Saxon . Her other features were Asian , and so were her attitudes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is not to say that she did not know a great deal about Europeans and Americans . Her reputation as an Asian editor brought her into contact with many foreigners . And she was attractive , single , and twenty-eight . Ruth knew many Americans . The city of Setkya , where she published her paper , was one of the important American foreign aid centers and fairly crawled with ICA technicians , USIS press agents , and cultural at  --  66  --  Everybody Loves Joe Bingtaches . Most of these Americans called upon her frequently for help and advice , so that it was inevitable that the USIS would invite her to America . In 1952 Ruth accepted an offer of a three months ' trip to learn about the press in the United States . Her first contact with America came in Hawaii . She was impressed by its beauty and charm  --  after she was finally able to see it . She was held up for hours in an Immigration and Customs waiting room for aliens . This room was neither dirty nor shabby ; but obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officials were cold almost to the point of insult . Ruth was too experienced a reporter either to waste time or to ignore first impressions . She picked up her notebook . They may not believe it , but Americans have poorer facilitiesfor visitors than Communist China , she wrote in her notebook . At every factory , village , or sports center  --  wherever you are  --  in China , there is a guest house . The house is often crude , but it is always the best one available . And this is very effective propaganda . In San Francisco she waited at the airport until her State Department escort arrived . Buying herself copies of the Chronicle and the Examiner , she sat down in the PanAmericanguest room and began to read . She went through both papers rapidly without finding the specific news she was looking for . A frown of disappointment crossed her face , and she reached for her notebook . Today , in Setkya , she wrote , the chiefs of seven major Asian nations are meeting . This conference may have profoundeffects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South Asian Bloc meeting in either of the two large San Francisco newspapers.  --  67  --  The Ugly AmericanI wonder why the American papers do not report this Asian news ? I notice that about 70 per cent of the paper space is taken up with advertising and comics . But I must read more papers in different cities before I begin to generalize . Now , about the average American woman I see here at the airport . A great many of them are wearing slacks and .. . " Miss Jyoti ? " " Yes , " she said , looking up . A debonair man of about fifty stood in front of her . Removing his black homburg , he bowed slightly . " I 'm Joseph Rivers of the State Department . Welcome to America . I very much enjoyed reading your articles on Father Finian . " " Thank you , Mr. Rivers . You are too generous . " " Of course , Miss Jyoti , as a private citizen Father Finian had a good deal more freedom of action than a person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Which might suggest that America should encourageher private citizens to do more of the sort of thing that Father Finian did . " Mr. Rivers looked at her sharply , and Ruth smiled at him . They did not mention Father Finian again . " Mr. Rivers , could you get me a copy of the New York Times ? " she asked . " You bet , " Mr. Rivers said , leading her through the busy terminal . " Say , Miss Jyoti , I was in Setkya for a few days not too long ago . You know Joe Bing there ? " When she shook her head , Mr. Rivers was genuinely astonished . " Why you must know him ! He 's chief of information for  --  68  --  Everybody Loves Joe Bingthe ICA in Setkya . Everyone knows him . There was an article on him in Life a few weeks ago . " " We do n't see much of Life in Setkya , Mr. Rivers . It 's a frightfully expensive magazine out there . " " But you have to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wears Tattersall checked vests . Lots of charm . Absolutely a male Elsa Maxwell . Knows everyone . I can remember him sitting in the cafe at the Hotel Montaigne . Nodded to everyone who went by ... " " Nodded to everyone who was European , Caucasian , western-educated , and decently dressed , " Miss Jyoti said coldly . " I know the bastard now . He drives a big red convertiblewhich he slews around corners and over sidewalks . And he 's got exactly the kind of loud silly laugh that every Asian is embarrassed to hear . " " Oh , come on now , Miss Jyoti , " Mr. Rivers said . " Old Joe is an expert newspaper man . He gives out all the copy on our aid program . " " He mails it out , or sends it by messenger , " Miss Jyoti repliedfirmly . " And he has one hell of a big party every month where he brags that every chunk of food and every drop of liquor comes from the good ole U.S.A. And at wholesale prices right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Asian at one of his parties for two years . At his first party he only had liquor , when Buddhists and Moslems drink only fruit juice or water or milk . And the word got around . " " I 'm truly sorry that you do n't know Joe well enough to understand his good points , " Mr. Rivers said lamely . He was somewhat frightened by the intensity with which Miss Jyoti spoke . Also he wondered how she could be a friend of Amer-* 69  --  The Ugly Americanica and still say such things about Old Joe . After all , everybodyloves Joe Bing . The Department loves him . The newspaperpeople love him . They chose him to set up the protocol for Nixon 's trip . Where the hell does she get off , saying things like that about Joe ? " You know , I heard about Joe Bing from Father Finian , " Ruth said sweetly as they got into the limousine for San Francisco . " Father Finian had written him to see if Joe could send him some American ballpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed me Joe 's reply : Commissary privileges are extended to American governmentalemployees and their dependents only ' with the relevantgovernment regulation . That was all . " " Well , you have to draw the line somewhere , or everyone would be piling into the commissaries , " Mr. Rivers said . " Oh , I agree . And after all , Father Finian wanted to use the pens for a private purpose  --  as prizes to the natives who did the best job of distributing their newspaper . At first it was an underground newspaper ; but lately it 's become one of the best rural newspapers in Burma . " " We could n't allow individuals to use commissary items to support private business , " Mr. Rivers said earnestly . " Oh , I agree with you , " Ruth said . Mr. Rivers sat back and began to . point out the sights of San Francisco . The San Francisco press gave Ruth a dinner two nights later at which she was asked to say a few words about Americansstationed in Asia . After a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dug into her subject with vigor.  --  70  --  Everybody Loves Joe Bing " Generally Americans in Asia are not effective . They are what I call the Intellectual Maginot Line . They feel that if the nice rich respectable people like them , they must be doing a good job . I can understand that . You look at foreign faces , hear strange languages  --  and you just feel more comfortable at the Press Club or the American Club or the Officer 's Club . Or anywhere where quiet people are wearing collars and ties and talking in English . The Asians who wear collars and ties and speak English are a special class , and most Americans have real difficulty meeting any other sort . And I regret having to say this , most of you do n't make the effort . I could stand here all night and tell you stories about one American mistake after another . But perhaps it will be more helpful if I tell you about an American who was effective . " He was Bob Maile of the USIS . Now I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it . But Bob Maile was . He did more to raise American prestige than anyone else over there  --  the ambassador included . " Bob was in Setkya for about five months before any of the editors even heard about him . Usually the first thing a new USIS official does is to come barging in on us . They fawn all over us  --  if we talk English  --  and start making big plans for our country  --  without knowing anything about it . It 's become such a pain in the neck that almost every editor has orders that no American is to be allowed in his office . And if one forces his way into my office , I just pretend I do n't speak English . " Bob was different . I met him and his wife Dorothy at a party given in his honor by the typesetters . You see , instead of barging in at the top with the air of an ambassador , Bob Maile started off by trying to become familiar with our lan  --  71  --  The Ugly Americanguage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters , the photographers , the circulation boys . He showed the photographers how to raise the ASA speed of their films so that they could take candid pictures without flash . He helped them get chemicals . He got a fan for the dark room and he made the light trap in his own home . " He did these things without asking for credit or telling anyone . In return , he wanted tutoring in our language , lessonsin our cooking for Dorothy , and help in getting his childreninto our schools . He was humble about everything , and he made it clear that he thought he was getting more than he was giving . " Now , not all of this is easy . I know enough about western standards to understand that sending an American child to a native school takes some courage . Asian schools are dirty , rowdy , noisy , and infectious by your standards . But Bob Maile 's kids did all right . They caught impetigo once , and got mixed up in a couple of fights  --  but they also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different kind of life . " Let me tell you a story that as newspaper men you 'll appreciate . About a year ago a story broke that an American soldier had raped a girl in a temple . The temple part made it the story of the century . If it had hit the headlines we would have had a religious war against the Americans on our hands . The chief American public information man in Setkya , a man whom many of you probably know , just holed up in his office . He never touched what he called native controversies . ' That meant he had n't time to buck it up to Washington for an answer . " Bob Maile , on the other hand , called on the editors of the  --  72  --  Everybody Loves Joe Bingbiggest papers and news services in Setkya . He did n't threaten anyone , or conceal information , or say that the story would be unfriendly to the United States . He just asked if we had checked it out thoroughly . " This is the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked it out  --  and it was wrong . An American had gone to a brothel , refused to pay when he left , on grounds that are unmentionable here , and got into a brawl . Not worth a paragraph in any paper . " Bob never brags about what his office does . He does n't have to . In my country good deeds are publicized all over by the bamboo telegraph . And Bob Maile is the best known American in my country . " I wish the other Americans were all like him . If they were , the Communists could n't last long in Asia .

Honest , Dex , these Sarkhaneseare really tricky . Sometimes I think they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not so sure about the loyalty of some of the Americans here , either . I guess that by now the Department 's been reading all the press lies about Sarkhan . The stories that reporter for the Times wrote are false . My relations with the Sarkhanese could n't be better , and the enclosed editorial from the Eastern Star proves it . And his stories about my neglecting that crackpotColvin because I was ignorant of the circumstances is pure hogwash . I personally saw Colvin right after he got into trouble . Also enclosed are clippings from the Sarkhanese  --  74  --  Confidential and Personalpapers published the day after . Colvin has a lot of drag in Wisconsin and may be raising hell through his senators and congressmen . Just show them the clippings . We got another crackpot here , too  --  Father Finian . This priest has to be handled with kid gloves . I do n't want to get into a beef with the Roman Catholics . But this Finian has just come from Burma where he started a small revolution ; now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local papers are beginning to raise hell . If Cardinal Spellman is for him , I can tolerate him , I suppose . But if the Catholic bigshots are down on him , I 'll get him shipped back to the States . Now Dex , aside from those two things  --  and despite the newspaper lies  --  everything is on an even keel out here . The Sarkhan politicians keep squawking that if we do n't bail them out the country will go Commie . Do n't believe it for a damned minute . I get around at one hell of a lot of social functions , and official dinners out here , and I 've never met a native Communist yet . And even though the Russian ambassa- dor screwed us for a little while on the rice deal , I had a hundred thousand handbills distributed saying that it was the good old USA who supplied the rice . In general , we 're in good shape out here . But what I need in a hurry for my staff are some people I can trust who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having to do everything myself .

He looked like a traveling salesman , Northwestern U. , a " big man on campus , " an inside dopester , a good journalist , and a man who knew his way about . . . all of which was true . Mr. Hamilton Upton spoke first with skill and dignity . His information was precise , and his audience felt that he was a worthy representative of a great power . . . a man who knew how to handle tough situations and tricky foreigners .

" I like the way he does n't call them Communists , those conspiracypeople , Marie Maclntosh thought . She was there with her three girl friends , all of whom worked in the Pentagon stenographic pool ; they shared a small apartment close to Rock Creek Park .

" Mr. Upton sat down and Mr. Joseph Bing pushed back his chair , hefted his body up , and walked around the table . He sat on the edge of the table and at once the entire audience relaxed . " My name is Bing , but I 'm a government public relations man and you can call me Joe , " he said . Everyone laughed . A few people in the audience said " Hiya , Joe , " and he waved his hand . " I work for men like Mr. Upton , and let me tell you it 's a pleasure . Foreign affairs is big business and it 's important business . You all know that .

" Mr. Upton very carefully was looking over Joe 's head at some distant speck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a smile on his face , with which everyone in the audience was pleased . They knew that Mr. Upton enjoyed what Joe was saying as much as they , and it made foreign duty seem like a family affair . Mr. Upton was the proper but protective father ; and Joe was the uncle who always shows up at Christmaswith whiskey on his breath and gifts in his suitcase . Joe went on for twenty minutes . He was expert at using the concrete example and answering the practical question . He knew about the price of alligator shoes in Brazil , the cost of Scotch in Japan , the availability of servants in Vietnam , the pension one could expect after twenty years of faithful service . He told about commissaries which stocked wholesome American food for Americans stationed all over the world . " You can buy the same food in Asia that you can in Peoria . Even , say , in Saigon they stock American ice cream , bread , cake , and , well , anything you want , " said Joe Bing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseas it 's still on the high American standard .

Two of them slept on a foldaway couch in the front room , and had to get up early so that the table could be opened for breakfast . Their only luxury was a bottle of  --  80  --  Employment Opportunitieswhiskey every Friday night which they drank with ginger ale because none of them liked the taste . Joe Bing finished his informal talk and then announced that he or Mr. Upton would be glad to answer questions . No one asked Mr. Upton a thing ; but Joe talked steadily for another half-hour . " What about learning to speak a foreign language ? " a small wiry girl asked . " I understand you have to learn the language of a country before you go there . " " Now , just a minute , " Joe said , his voice full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dope . Uncle Sammy is not crazy . How many people do you think we could round up in this country who can speak Cambodian or Japanese or even German ? Well , not very many . I do n't parlez vous very well myself , but I 've always made out pretty well in foreign countries . Fact is , we do n't expect you to know the native language . Translators are a dime a dozen overseas . And besides , it 's better to make the Asians learn English . Helps them , too . Most of the foreigners you 'll do business with speak perfect English . " " I hear everything 's expensive overseas , " said another listener . " Can we ever save money ? " Joe Bing laughed . " Look , your housing 's all paid for .

With the exception of Atkins , that engineer , every applicant will be making more money with the government than he does in the job he has now . Frankly , I think we 're getting slobs .

Her life was drab , and she knew it . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . The one hope she had for a change in her routine life was her application for overseas duty . Although Marie had interesting bosses and a responsible job , life was dull . She left her apartment at six-thirty in the morning so that she could get a seat on the bus , and also so that she could eat breakfast in the government cafeteria . Usuallyshe stayed in her office until almost five-thirty , and would then have dinner in the government cafeteria . This routine meant she avoided the crowded buses ; and it was much cheaper and easier than eating in the crowded apartment . Marie 's nights were almost all the same . After doing her share of the apartment cleaning and her own laundry , she sat in front of the TV set with her three roommates . Then Marie received a letter of acceptance to her applica. -  --  83  --  The Ugly Americantion for overseas duty . She was to go to Sarkhan . Three months later she landed at Haidho airfield . A month later she wrote her ex-roommates a letter : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Haidho was wonderful . I flew first class all the way  --  the real deluxe treatment  --  all paid for . It was great . ( Remember the time we flew tourist class to Chicago and packed our lunches in our handbags , and how we had to stand in line ? ) Well , naturally I was scared when I stepped off the plane at Haidho ( the capitol of Sarkhan ) . Everything was new and I did n't know what to expect . Well , girls , there was a chauffeur-driven car waiting for me at the airport along with a reception committee . I did n't have to go through customs or anything . When I asked about my luggage , Mister Preston ( the man who came to meet me ) said never mind , Tonki will look after it . Tonki is a Sarkhanese who works for the embassy here . Two of the girls who met me are also secretaries and they said that I should live with them if I wanted to ; and I 'm staying with them now . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each have our own bedroom  --  and there 's an extra for guests . There 's a diningroom , a living room , and maid 's quarters . And there are built-in servants ! Honest . We have three servants to look after us . It 's a family of them , father , mother , and a fourteenyear old girl . They do the cooking , cleaning , laundry  --  everything . Oh how they baby us ! When they wake me in the morning , they bring a glass of orange juice and a cup of tea . This is real living . The Americans here are very friendly . They all give parties and plenty of them ; there 's at least one cocktail party or dinner every night . It 's easy to do , of course , because everyone has help . All I have to do is check with my housemates to see if it 's okay , and then call the servant . " Ehibun , " I say , " we 're having ten for dinner next Tuesday . Can you handle it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , mum , " she says , and that 's all there is to it . And what a dinner for ten it turns out to be ! Just like in the movies . Liquor over here in the government liquor store is dirt cheap . There 's no tax on it  --  so Johnny Walker Black Label , Old Grand Dad , and Beefeater Gin are all less than two dollars a bottle . And we also have a Commissary and PX . And speaking of things being cheap , I 'm buying a new Hillman . I can get it for much less than the U. S. price . It 's duty free , and there 's some special arrangement so the government brings it over for me from England for nothing . There are only about a thousand Americans here , and we stick together . That means that we girls get asked to everything . I 've been to the ambassador 's parties several times ; and to lots of dinners at the MAAG ( Military Assistance and Advisory Group ) and the USIS and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time to go to the office  --  I see my car is waiting in front . We 're driven to work and back in a government car pool . I have to get to the office early today so I can take a long lunch hour , because I have an appointment with my dressmaker . The best thing about being here is that for the first time in my life I can save money . Of course , my rent is free . My basic salary is $3400 , but on top of that I get a $68o increase in pay because of location . You see , this is defined by the Department as a hardshippost .

The only people out were the peasants , who splashed through the muddy streets in straw raincoatsand enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odor of mushrooms  --  was everywhere . Even the airconditionedrooms of the American Ambassador were not truly dry . In the wet season foreigners wearing tight western clothes suffered from various skin irritations , mostly a kind of fungus growth . Tempers became raw . In this particular wet season occurred the incident of the Royal Sarkhanese Air Base . About fifty years before the United States government had purchased a thousand acres on the outskirts of Haidho . What the plans had been for the tract , no one remembers ; and the land lay idle until 1947 . During the rainy season of that year the Sarkhanese Air Force had requested the use of the prop  --  87  --  The Ugly Americancrty for a training area ; it was high , hard , flat ground which could be used all year round . Permission was granted and the Royal Sarkhanese Treasury spent many millions improving the land . It was only natural for fashionable suburbs to spring up around it ; and the American tract came to be one of the most valuable pieces of real estate in Sarkhan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed a rumor that the Royal Sarkhanese Air Force was to be evicted from the American property , so that American land speculators could sell it for building lots . The next day every other paper in Sarkhan picked the story up . So did the Pan Asia Press , the United Press , the Associated Press , the International News Service . So did Tass , Reuters , and Press France . The hostile paper kept the story alive in its headlines day after day . " Our tip must be true , " they wrote , " because no one at the American Embassy denies it . " The editor of the English language paper , an American , called up the USIS . " Look , " he said , " this silly story  --  which I know must be a lie  --  is hurting the United States . This afternoon I 'm going to round up the editors of the four leading dailies and bring them to see the ambassador . I 'm going to ask him point blank about the Air Force Training Area . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . Also , it will make the Commie press lose a lot of face . Okay for two o'clock ? " Joe Bing , the new public affairs officer , was on a cultural trip to Hong Kong ; and his assistant , the press attache , had to carry the ball . When he told Ambassador Sears that he would be interviewed that afternoon , the ambassador 's face got red , and his eyes bulged. .88 . The Ambassador and the Press " No , by God ! " he shouted , banging the desk , " you 're not going to foul me up at this stage of the game . You see this ? " he yelled , holding up a letter . " This is from the President . And he says that a federal judgeship will open up in four months and he would be pleased if I took it . And I intend to . And I do n't intend to get mixed up with a bunch of skunks between now and then . Tell Joe Bing to handle it ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you take care of them . " " They want to see you , sir . I 've already tried to stall them . " The ambassador flopped back in his chair and a cunning look came into his eyes . " All right , " he said . " Let ' em come . You can bring your radical friends here at two . I 'll be ready . " At two that afternoon the five editors entered the ambassador'soffice . " Sit down , gentlemen . What can I do for you ? " The American editor said , " Mr. Ambassador , there 's a story making the rounds that the United States is about to evict the Air Force from land lent them by the United States . This would mean that all their millions of dollars of building would have to go . The property is supposed to be turned over to American real estate salesmen to sell as subdivisions . " " Yes , gentlemen . I 've read the story . " " Well , sir , is it true or is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He poked the end of a pencil into his ear , then smoothed his gray hair , then looked at the ceiling . " Gentlemen , " he said finally . " I have no comment to make . " The four Asian editors looked at each other in amazement , thanked the ambassador , and left . The American remained behind . When they were gone , he shouted , " For God 's sake ,  --  89 . The Ugly Americanyou 've got to comment . This is the same as saying it 's true . I-lell , it 'll be all over the world . You know that eviction story is a goddam lie . " " Tell you the truth , son , " said the ambassador , " I do n't know if it 's true or not . " " Then cable to Washington and ask them if it 's true ! " The ambassador pressed a button on his desk . A moment later the deputy chief of mission came in . " Yes , sir ? " " Say , Charlie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darn good idea .... "  --  90  --  The Ugly AmericanOn February 13th the following message was received at the U. S. Embassy in Sarkhan . Personal for Ambassador from Dexter Peterson X This will be advance notice to you that your judgeship has been approvedby the President and will become effective immediatelyon your return X Believe your replacement will be Gilbert MacWhite X CongratulationsOnce his judgeship was assured Lucky Lou was somewhat saddened at having to leave Sarkhan . Almost at once he felt a warm glow of affection for the place . His affection was not so intense , however , that he forgot practical political matters . He did the following three things before throwing one of the most liquid parties in the history of Haidho . He refused to extend protection to one Father Finian on the grounds that he intended to " participate in the domestic politics of another power . " He again recommended to the Sarkhanese government that they refuse a visa to one John Colvin , who , having recuperatedat Johns Hopkins Hospital , now wanted to return to Sarkhan . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as this to become a part of the official record . They never did anyone any good.  --  91  --  The Ugly AmericanHe wrote a long careful report to the State Depaitnient pointing out the gains which had been made in Sarkhan during his tenure in that country . He pointed out that " there are always those who pick away at sound policies or tend to exaggerate normal internal political frictions . Sarkhan is more firmly than ever on the side of America . " O  --  92 . 9Everyone Has EarsThe Honorable Gilbert MacWhite , Ambassadorto Sarkhan , was a fit man . At the age of forty-four he weighed exactly the same as he had when he graduated from Princeton with the class of 1934  --  He had red hair ; his body was hard and muscular . When he was in the States or in Englandhe played squash at least three times a week , and in other countries he always managed to play tennis . He smoked little , and always fine , thin , handrolled Havana cigars . He held his liquor well . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he could , if he had to , drink immense quantities of vodka , sake , or Scotch ; and his tongue never thickened and his mind seldom dulled . MacWhite was , from his first day in the State Department , a professional foreign service officer . He needed no breaking in . He was competent , exact , and highly efficient . He also was courageous and outspoken , and he had imagination . Duringthe McCarthy excitement he kept his head and ran his desk smoothly . By 1952 he had served as Consul General in four large foreign cities , as Deputy Chief of Mission in two cities , and was regarded by his superiors as a corner.  --  93  --  The Ugly AmericanIn 1954 , the Honorable Gilbert MacWhite was made Ambassadorto Sarkhan . It was an assignment that pleased him deeply . He knew that the Sarkhan government was new , inexperienced , and shaky , and that the eighteen million Sarkhanesewere restless . He knew that the Communists in Sarkhan were strong , competent , and well organized ; he had not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . MacWhite 's knowledge of Marxism and Leninism , and the Titoist and Maoist versions of the faith was enormous . He was a recognized expert on Soviet theory and practice . Ambassador MacWhite prepared for his new assignment with a thoroughness in the best traditions of missionary faith . He learned the Sarkhanese language in fifteen weeks of incrediblydifficult work . He read every book he could find on Sarkhanese history and political life . He talked to anthropologists , sociologists , political scientists , diplomats , and businessmenwho had visited Sarkhan in the last several years . He read the reports of his predecessor , Louis Sears . Haidho is almost unbelievable . The city rests on a high plateau which overlooks the Pacific ; although the forest presses in around the buildings with a heavy green persistence , each of the buildings is distinct and intact . The people of Sarkhan did not erect monumental buildings . Most of the public buildings and almost all of the private homes were made of a light yellow volcanic stone , which the tropical climate and the constant jungle rainfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle , subterranean , almost a vision of a city seen under the sea . Haidho was hot , but neither Gilbert nor his wife Molly were dismayed by this . They were prepared to endure the  --  94  --  Everyone Has Earsheat of the tropics , and neither they nor their boys had ever complained of hardships . Indeed , as the Honorable Gilbert MacWhite looked from the upper window of his embassy out over the plateau and the ocean beyond , he was aware of how absorbed he had become in his job . In the six months he had been at Sarkhan he had hardly noticed the climate . In those six months Ambassador MacWhite had drawn his lines of battle against the Communists  --  shrewdly , patiently , with infiniteimagination , after almost endless consultations with nativeleaders , and , he thought , with a certainty of victory . The planning had been in absolute secret ; in fact , only three members of the U. S. Embassy staff knew about the swift , ruthlesscampaign which would soon take place . To ensure maximumsecurity , MacWhite had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MacWhite was enthusiastic about the battle . He did not underestimate the strength of the Communists in Sarkhan , but neither did he underestimate his own strengths and capabilities . In fact , Ambassador MacWhite regarded his anticipated combat with the Communists as the capstone of his career . He saw it as a battle in which the shrewdness of the businessman , the tactical ingenuity of the military man , and the intelligence and persistence of the diplomat would all be combined to achieve a victory which was , although Ambassador MacWhitewould never have said it in so arrogant a way , almost a personal victory . This afternoon he meant to cement another fragment into the wall of his strategy against the Communists . He was waiting for the Honorable Li Pang . Mr. Li was a representative of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek . Ambassador MacWhite had invited Li to come to Sarkhan to meet with the local  --  95  --  The Ugly AmericanChinese leaders . Most of the local Chinese had lived in Sar- khan for five generations . They considered themselves native Sarkhanese and highly patriotic . And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they also considered them- selves patriotic Chinese , and saw no conflict in this dual obli- gation . Li and MacWhite were old friends . They were both busi- nessmen ; and although they had left business for quite differ- ent reasons , they both left rich . They were both soldiers . And , by a curious coincidence , they were both Episcopalians . They understood one another . MacWhite was sure that Li would help commit the local Chinese to the battle against the native Communists . When he was sure of this , MacWhite was ready to move . As he looked out of the plateglass window of the Embassy Residence , Ambassador MacWhite was aware of the fact that Donald and Roger were in the room behind him . Somehow the small pitter-patter noises that they were making were a comfort to him . Donald and Roger were both elderly Chinese . The only English words they knew were the names given them by their American employers and a few necessary house- hold terms . They had been trusted servants of the Embassy since an American ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an efficiency , dedication , and kindli- ness that never failed to touch Ambassador MacWhite . They often helped Molly with the boys . They were both excellent cooks and superb butlers . They were , somehow , a symbol of the decent Asian , and they made the entire struggle in which Ambassador MacWhite was engaged meaningful and impor- tant . They represented the honor and morality which had been taught by Confucius.  --  96  --  Everyone Has EarsAmbassador MacWhite turned and walked toward the stairs as Mr. Li approached . " Your Excellency , I have prepared a pitcher of very dry and cold martinis in your honor , " MacWhite said , smiling . " Your Excellency , I am prepared to drink the entire pitcher , " Li said and smiled back . " Did I ever tell you , AmbassadorMacWhite , the story of the woman who got stuck in the lavatory on the thirty-fourth floor of the WaldorfAstoria , and who lived on martinis because they were the only things that could be siphoned in through the keyhole ? " Ambassador MacWhite laughed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They drank and talked quietly for ten minutes . In another half-hour Molly would join them and they would have a long and pleasant dinner . Before Molly came down , MacWhite had to talk to Li . When Li had finished a story he was telling , MacWhite leaned toward him . " Li , I have been frank with you and you have , I think , been frank with me , " MacWhite said . " I should like to discuss with you a subject which I think is of the utmost importance . " " If it 's anything I can do for you , Gilbert , you may be sure of it . " Li said . MacWhite paused while Donald filled their glasses with martinis ; then he spoke . " The problem is simple , Li . With your military background , you 'll understand it quickly , " MacWhite said . " It 's a matter of strategic intelligence . I should like to know which of the Chinese leaders are sympathetic to the Communists . I have an absolutely flawless plan for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Li did not stop smiling ; but in some subtle , quick way his entire expression changed . He was still smiling , he was still . 97  --  The Ugly Americansipping the martini , he was still poised . But his eyes had gone icy hard , and he was looking over MacWhite 's shoulder at Donald and Roger who were standing at the serving table about fifteen feet away . He laughed softly , but MacWhite was aware that there was a warning in the laugh . The entire mood of the conversation had changed . MacWhite , a sensitive person , knew that he was in trouble . " Now please understand me , Li , I would not use this information to hurt any good Chinese in Sarkhan , " MacWhite said . " It would be for my ears only ; but I think you can see that it would be critical in the coming struggle against the Communists in this country . " " I am aware of that , Gilbert , " Li said . " I can see at once the importance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Li finished his martini in a long slow steady sip , and put the empty glass on the table . Then he lit a cigarette , inhaled deeply , and ground the cigarette out in the ashtray . When he looked up his face was utterly foreign to MacWhite . For the first time in his life MacWhite saw a completely furious Oriental . MacWhite was shaken . " Gilbert , you are a fool . A great fool , " Li said . " I am speakingsoftly so that only you will hear my voice . But to discuss matters of such importance with servants in the room ... " MacWhite interrupted him , " Donald and Roger are old and trusted . They do n't understand a word of English . And they 're on the other side of the room behind the pantry screen . " " No one , Gilbert , is to be trusted , whether he is an old servant or not , " Li said . " Whether he is next to you or in the basement . "  --  98  --  Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth MacWhiteknew that he was not joking . " Let me reassure you , Li , " MacWhite said . " Neither Donaldnor Roger can understand a word of English . Before I hired them I had their credentials checked with the Sarkhan national police authorities . My predecessor vouched for their integrity and honesty . In 1941 , these men buried the Embassy valuables when the Japs came . After the war they came back and returned them . That silver service over there is one of the things they saved . " When Li spoke his voice was still flat and cold and the lines had not vanished from his nose and mouth . " Gilbert , I must say it again , I have just seen you do a foolish thing . " There was nothing that Li could have said that would have been more offensive to MacWhite . Li was accusing MacWhiteof being neither tough-minded nor security conscious , things that he prided himself he was . In fact , although he would not tell Li this , MacWhite had laid elaborate traps to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called peremptory commands to them in English ; when their strides never broke , and their faces never changed expression , he had been satisfied that they knew no English . He was also certain that they could not write . He had never seen either of them with a pen or pencil in his hand , nor had either ever sent a letter from the house . MacWhite scowled , his face reflecting his thoughts . These two Chinese are my friends . They have served America for almost twenty years . During the war they risked their lives for us . The expression on Li 's face did not change in the slightest . He walked up to the bar , picked up the pitcher of martinis ,  --  99  --  The Ugly Americanand refilled MacWhite 's glass and his own . Then he sat down and faced MacWhite . " You are a clever man , Gilbert , " Li said . " Now , if you wanted information from the American Embassy , where would be the perfect place to have your spy ? " " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " As his valet , " said MacWhite with reluctance . " And after that ? " " As his switchboard operator . " " Would your spy be a suspicious character , or someone who would earn his boss 's trust and confidence ? " MacWhite looked up sharply . For the first time he felt a flash of doubt , a tiny gnaw of anxiety . All of these positions in his embassy and many more  --  the translators , the messengers , the chauffeurs , the clerks  --  all were filled by Asians . And he suddenly realized that in every U. S. Embassy in the world , and in all the USIS offices , the military assistance missions , the economic missions , these vulnerable positions were held by aliens . He began automatically , but with panic , to analyze how he allowed this to happen in his embassy . " How much time do we have before Molly will join us ? " Li asked softly . " Almost twenty minutes , " MacWhite answered . Li leaned back in his chair and roared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger came trotting forward . Donald looked quickly about the room for the martini pitcher , picked it up , and splashed gin and the barest suggestion of vermouth into it . Then he stood in front of the two men and quietly filled their glasses . Li finished half of the fresh martini , placed it on the coffee-table , and stood up  --  100  --  Everyone Has Earsslowly . Something about his posture , some slight menace in his face , caused both Donald and Ambassador MacWhite to watch him closely . And as he stood up , Li changed . The smile fell away from his face , his body tensed as if under some enormous strain . Although he was six inches shorter than Donald , Donald drew back sharply as if he had been threatened . Speaking in Sarkhanese , Li ordered Roger to leave the room . Then , with eyes as black and hard as bits of chilled steel , Li turned to Donald . He spoke in Chinese , slowly , and MacWhite was able to follow the conversation easily . " The American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embassy , " Li said in a low , hard voice . " A valuable wristwatch is missing . Four bottles of Scotch whiskeyare missing . The Ambassador is determined to find the person that stole these things , and we know , you cunning scum , that you are the thief . " Donald protested shrilly . He had never stolen anything , he wailed , and he looked beseechingly at MacWhite . Li stepped forward and slapped Donald across the mouth . MacWhite was shocked . Li 's fingers left four red marks on Donald 's cheek . Donald 's old and kindly face was twisted in surprise , his jaw open . Li turned to MacWhite as if nothing had happened . He spoke distinctly to MacWhite in English . " He denies stealing the whiskey and watch , " Li said , " but he is lying . Once we establish that he has stolen them we can ask him about the typewriter and the briefcase . Those are what we really want . " MacWhite nodded , going along with Li 's deception , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in Li . Li had always struck him as Anglicized , as open and straight  --  101  --  The Ugly Americanforward . Li knew American jokes , English ballads , Irish dialects . He was as American as a tractor salesman . But now he looked menacing , hooded , tight with cruelty . Every word Li spoke was like a whiplash . MacWhite had seen interrogations before . During the war he had earned a reputation as a skillful interrogator himself . But he had seen nothing like this . It was not so much an interrogationas the deliberate destruction of a person . What Li did was like a physical assault aimed at destroying Donald . It was all MacWhite could do to keep from interrupting . With exquisite detail Li was telling Donald what the informalpenalties for lying were . He told of a Sarkhanese police sergeant who specialized in battering a single testicle to a pulp , of a police corporal who had maimed a common thief for life . He told these facts as if they were commonplace , ordinary , and well-known ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald , you know the penalties of lying , " Li said , quietly . " I have warned you . So tell me the truth . That 's all ... just the simple truth . When you have done that , you can go . " His voice ended soothingly , but then changed into a commanding harsh tenor . " You say you come from Moukung , " Li went on . " That is in Western Szechwan province . Did you ever hear of Peng Teh-huai ? Answer quickly , at once . " Donald hesitated and licked his lips . " Yes , I have heard of him , " Donald said . " Did you march with Peng and his Communists to Shensi in 1934 ? " Li asked . " No , I did not . "  --  102  --  Everyone Has Ears " Where were you in 1934 ? You have been to school . You speak with an educated accent . But you are the son of a pig peasant in Szechwan and there is nothing so poor as a pig peasant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to school ? " Li said , and his voice was heavy with loathing . Donald flushed with anger . " Even a pig peasant 's son can go to school . . . " Donald began , but Li cut in sharply . " If he is given money by the Communists to go through school ? " " I did not say that . I was trying to say . . . " " You were trying to lie . You have told Ambassador MacWhitethat you could not write , but already you confess that you went to school in Moukung . " Donald 's eyes blinked , a quick involuntary tic of surprise . Li abruptly changed the questioning and began to interrogateDonald about his family . He never allowed Donald to finish an answer . Whenever Donald hesitated , Li supplied the answer ; and each of Li 's answers damned Donald . Li insulted Donald and teased him about being a Communist ; then he suggested that any honest Chinese should properly be a Communist , interpreted Donald 's silence as agreement , and attacked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threatened that Donald 's children would be hounded to death by Chiang 's agents . Donald 's answers became more tense , more confusing , more protective . MacWhite had a first suspicion that part of what Li had concluded might be right . Then abruptly Li looked terribly tired . He seemed to shrink in size , to become more harmless . His voice became pleading . He seemed to wish the interrogation were over.  --  103  --  The Ugly American " Help us all out , Donald , " Li said quietly . " Tell us where the whiskey and wristwatch are . That 's all we want . Then you can go . " Donald straightened , seemed to grow in strength as Li weakened . MacWhite felt his confidence in Donald return . He felt a flash of admiration for the courage of the old man . Donald was even smiling slightly . " I know nothing of the wristwatch or the whiskey , " he said easily . " But I know that the typewriter and briefcase were not stolen . They are both in Ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Li wheeled , as quick and sharp as a mongoose , as terrible as a tiger about to kill . " Who said anything about a typewriter or briefcase , Donald ? " he screamed . " Who ? Where did you hear that ? " Donald 's face was stricken . " You heard that because I mentioned it in English to AmbassadorMacWhite , " Li said , and now he was speaking in English . " You understand English . And for months you have been overhearing what the ambassador says as you serve martinis and pick up trays and clear cigarette butts away . " He put his face close to Donald 's and his intensity was so awful , his presence so menacing , that Donald went rigid . " Yes , I lied , " Donald said in English . It was not flawless English , but it was English , and his voice held both horror and humiliation . " I did it only because the Communists hold my children in Moukung . They will kill them if I do not supply them with information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambassador Mac  --  104  --  Everyone Has EarsWhite 's plans to smash them in Sarkhan , " Li said , and this time it was not a question . Donald nodded dumbly . " You may leave the room , but do not leave the house , " Li said . " We will want to talk to you later . " Donald left , and MacWhite watched him go . MacWhite knew that all of his careful work , his spending of millions of dollars , his cunning strategy , were all wasted . He knew that he , the Honorable Gilbert MacWhite , had made a terrible mistake . Somewhere in his carefully trained mind , in his rigorous background , in his missionary zeal , there was a flaw . It hit him very hard . Beneath the humility he had always , consciously kept on the surface , and which he had always believed in , not only as a necessity in dealing with the world , not only as a requirement of the social human , not only as a prerequisite of the receptive mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humility there had been a rigid core of ego which had permitted him to place a fatal amount of faith in his own , unsupported judgement . He did not know where it was or how it got there or even how to remove it . But he knew that it was there , and he hated Li for showing it to him . But he was too tough-minded and analytical to remain stunned . He looked up slowly . Li was standing in front of the windowlooking out over the beautiful countryside of Sarkhan , up at the snow white clouds of the Sarkhanese sky . Li swung around and faced MacWhite . " I am sorry , Gilbert , " he said softly . " It is not an easy thing to be cruel to an old man . Nor is it an easy thing to put105The Ugly Americandoubts into a man as skilled and dedicated as you . But it was necessary . But necessary things are not always nice . This was very , very bad . " They were both standing there quietly , looking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a simple , light blue , expensive dress from Saks Fifth Avenue , and gaily called for a martini.  --  106  --  The Ugly AmericanMacWhite had learned long ago that recriminations are a kind of luxury , and he never let himself afford such a pleasure . He knew he had made a mistake , and he knew that it was a mistake both of judgment and of information . For two days he sat quietly in his office , analyzing his errors of omission , the nature of his problem , and the alternatives open to him . He recognized that he did not know enough about the Asian personality and the way it played politics . There was a strain of coldness , an element of finality , about the whole thing he had never encountered before . Politics in Asia were played for total stakes . He also recognized that he could learn from the experience of others . The evening of the second day MacWhite sent a cable to the State Department .

As the Minister of Defense , Magsaysay had led the long and fatiguing battle against the CommunistdominatedI-luks in the Philippines . Later he led a unified government that efficiently ruled the huge archipelago . Magsaysay and MacWhite talked long and earnestly , and MacWhite 's notes on the conversation became the substance of a long ( and well-ignored ) report that was sent to the State Department . But there was one point which Magsaysay made that MacWhite did not have to put in writing , and never forgot . " The simple fact is , Mr. Ambassador , that average Americans , in their natural state , if you will excuse the phrase , are the best ambassadors a country can have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are eager to share their skills , they are generous . But something happens to most Americans when they go abroad . Many of them are not average .. . they are second-raters . Many of them , against their own judgment , feel that they must live up to their commissaries and big cars and cocktail parties . But get an unaffected American , sir , and you have an asset . And if you get one , treasure him  --  keep him out of the cocktail circuit , away from bureaucrats , and let him work in his own way . " " Do you know any around ? " MacWhite asked wryly . " I could use a few on my own staff . " " I do , " Magsaysay said . " The Rag-Time Kid  --  Colonel Hillandale . He can do anything . But I hope you do n't steal him from here . " MacWhite noted the name . " What else would you do if you were I ? " MacWhite asked . " I 'd go up to Vietnam and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dien Bien Phu , " Magsaysay said without hesitating . " I know you 're a diplomat and that warfare is not supposed to be your game ; but you 'll discover soon enough out here that statesmanship , diplomacy , economics , and warfare just ca n't be separated from one another . And if you keep your eyes and ears open , you 'll start to see some of the connections between them . It 's not something you can learn from textbooks . It 's a feel for the thing . " e )  --  109  --  10The Ragtime KidIn the Air Force there is a man with the improbablename of Edwin B. Hillandale . The " B " stands for Barnum . Colonel Hillandale is one of those happy , uninhibited people who can dance and drink all night and then show up at eight fresh and rested . However , the Colonel seldom dances and drinks all night . About two in the morning he usually joins the orchestra in a jam session , playing his harmonica close to the mike , improvising like Satchmo himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds like a concerto for jazz band and harmonica . But jazz is not the colonel 's only pleasure . He enjoys eating , and he loves to be with people . Any kind of people . In 1952 Colonel Hillandale was sent to Manila as liaison officer to something or other . In a short time the Philippines fascinated him . He ate his meals in little Filipino restaurants , washing down huge quantities of adobo and pancit and rice with a brand of Filipino rum which cost two pesos a pint . Ile embraced everything Filipino  --  he even attended the Universityin his spare hours to study Tagalog . Colonel Hillandale became Manila 's own private character. 0 110 0The Ragtime KidThe politicians and the eggheads fondly called him Don Edwin ; the taxi drivers and the balut vendors and the waiters called him the Arnericano 111ustrado ; and the musicians referred to him as The Ragtime Kid . The counsellor up at the American Embassy always spoke of him as " that crazy bas-tard . " But within six months the crazy bastard was eating breakfast with Magsaysay , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1953 , Magsaysay was campaigning for the presidential election . He barnstormed the Philippine Archipelago , and was greeted with enthusiasm everywhere he went . Everywhere  --  except in one province north of Manila . Here the Communist propagandists had done too good a job . The Reds had persuaded the populace that the wretched Americanswere rich , bloated snobs , and that anyone who associated with them  --  as did Magsaysay  --  could n't possibly understand the problems and the troubles of the Filipino . The political experts predicted that Magsaysay would lose the province . One Saturday Magsaysay 's friend , Colonel Hillandale , went to this province . When he arrived in the capital about halfpasteleven , the people of Cuenco saw something they had never in their lives seen before . A tall , slender U. S. Air Force Colonel with red hair and a big nose drove into Cuenco on a red motorcycle , whose gas tank had painted on it in black " The Ragtime Kid . " He chugged up the main street and stopped at the most crowded part . He parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sauntered over near a large pool hall and sat down in the street  --  on the curb . After wavingand smiling at everyone , he took out his harmonica and be- 111 0The Ugly Americangan to play favorite Filipino tunes in a loud and merry way ; he played the first few stanzas in the classical manner , and the last two or three in a jazzed-up style . Within about fifteen minutes a crowd of about two hundred people surrounded the colonel . They enjoyed : the music , but they were suspicious of this man who represented the richest of the rich Americans . Colonel Hillandale began playing Planting Rice is Never Fun . After going through a stanza he stopped , looked around at the crowd , and said in Tagalog , " Come on , join in . " In a thin tenor he sang a few words ; then , jamming the harmonica up to his mouth , he played as loud and sweet as he could . The crowd began to sing  --  about three hundred Filipinos standing in a tightly-packed circle singing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this strange man . At twelve o'clock the church bells sounded the Angelus . The Ragtime Kid put his harmonica in his pocket and stood up . " Well , I sure am starving , " he said . " I 'd sure like some adobo and pancit . " The Filipinos looked at each other shyly . The Ragtime Kid in colonel 's uniform let his eyes go around the circle . " I 'm hoping someone here will invite me to lunch . I 'm broke . " " You do n't have any money ? " said one of the Filipinos . The colonel put his hands in his pockets , dragged out hiswallet , opened it , and showed that it was empty . He thrusthis other hand into his side pocket and pulled out some change . " Sixty centavos . " " But Americans are rich . " " Not me . " " You 're fooling. " 0 112  --  The Ragtime KidThe colonel was still speaking in Tagalog , " We have poor people in America just like you have in the Philippines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Air Force . I know you get about two thousand pesos a month . " " That 's right . And that 's a lot of money . But I have big expenses . I have a wife and three children back in America . How much does a bottle of rum cost here ? " " Two pesos . " " In America it costs six pesos . " " Honest ? " " Yes . And how much rent do you pay a month for your house ? " " Forty pesos . " " Mine in America costs two hundred and forty pesos  --  and it 's a very small house . I ca n't get any for less . " " It seems impossible . " The crowd stood silent . " This is undignified , " said the colonel quietly . " Never before have I met Filipinos who would turn down a hungry man . " One of the Filipinos thrust through the crowd . " You will eat at my house ! " " No , come to my house . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come with me . " And that 's where the colonel went , with about ten Filipinos . They ate adobo and pancit and rice , and they washed it down with Filipino rum and San Miguel beer ; and they sang many songs to the accompaniment of the Ragtime Kid 's harmonica . And when lunch was through , the Filipinos invited him to come up again next Saturday , which he did . And the next Saturday after that . And the next Saturday after that , too.  --  113  --  The Ugly AmericanAnd so , after a while , no one in that area believed any more that all Americans were rich and bloated snobs . After all , their Ragtime Kid who played sweet music on his mouth organ was one of them , and he was a colonel in the U. S. Air Force . The Communists in the hills and the barrios objected ; but the other Filipinos outshouted them . They said , " Do not tell us lies . We have met and seen and eaten and got drunk and made music with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 95 per cent of the inhabitants of that province voted for President Magsaysay and his pro-American platform in the 1953 elections . Perhaps it was n't The Ragtime Kid who swung them ; but if that 's too easy an answer , there is no other.  --  114 011The Iron of WarMAJOR JAMES ( TEX ) WOLCHEK  --  Born March I2 , 1924 , in Fort Worth , Texas .

" Major James Wolchek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2d Regiment Amphibie , Legion Ltrangere , " Major Wolchek said crisply . He drew himself up sharply in front of the French officer sitting behind the desk and saluted . Major Monet was a small man , and he was obviously tired . He looked up from his desk , and examined Wolchek . Then Major Monet smiled . " Maj or , you look like what I have heard Texans call whang  --  115  --  The Ugly Americanleather . ' I hope that 's not an insult ; it 's not intended so . " Major Monet spoke excellent English . Major Wolchek smiled . " Thank you , sir . I do happen to be from Texas . " " And , of course , your nickname is ' Tex , ' " Monet said . Wolchek nodded . They smiled at one another for a brief second and then Monet began to go through a drawer , explainingthat he had Wolchek 's orders . Tex stared out the open window while he waited . Monet 's office was on the outskirts of Hanoi , and Tex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and half-tracks moving out towards the lowlands where the Battle f , ) r the Delta was being fought . On both sides of the road , heading in the opposite direction , were lines of Vietnamese natives . They were fleeing to the city . Tex smiled as he thought of Monet 's use of " whang leather . " Tex had heard the phrase applied to himself before , though never by a Frenchman . In a way , he thought , it was ironic that he should look so much like the imaginary Texan . His parents had come to Fort Worth from Lithuania two years before Tex was born ; they were short , dark , and small-muscled people . They had always dreamed of the American frontier ; they found the American magic in Texas . Something about the sun and the food and the climate made their children grow tall and muscular , and all six of the Wolchek children were models of what Texans thought Texans looked like . Father Wolchek had invested his savings in Fort Worth real estate and had made a fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was openly proud of the fact that his oldest son was an officer and a fighter . And the knowledge of his family 's love and support6 116  --  The Iron of Warhad helped Tex through many almost intolerable situations . Tex 's body held bits of the iron of two wars . The first time he was hit had been in Normandy . He was one of the paratroopers who were dropped in the early darknessof D-Day behind the Normandy beaches . A German flare burst just over his parachute , and on the way down he caught seven machine gun slugs in his legs . By the time he hit the ground his boots were full of blood and he could no longer walk . But he could crawl ; and in the next five hours he crawled three miles . A disorganized platoon of Germans , retreating down a small road , came upon a tall American leaning casually against a tree . The American was Tex . He had a confident look on his face and a carbine in his hands . He did not speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their arms and put up their hands . The German officer attempted to bolt ; but before he had gone three steps , Tex shot him . A half-hour later the German platoon realized that their captor was leaning against a tree because he could n't use his legs , but by that time it was too late . Doctors later removed six of the slugs from his legs ; the seventh they had to leave in because it was embedded in the bone . Tex received a Silver Star for this action . He got his second wound on Pork Chop Hill in Korea , when he led a reinforced patrol over the parapets and into the misty ground between the American and Chinese lines . It was impossible to see , but Tex heard sounds of fighting . They had gone only ioo yards before he realized that the Chinese were launching a massive attack . He knew that his hilltop redoubt could not stand against so many men . He had no choice but to move ahead with his patrol and disrupt the  --  117  --  The Ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a haymowerthrough a fresh field . He cut through to the divisional headquarters ' bunker of the Chinese lines , put it under a heavy grenade attack , and captured it . They killed every man in the bunker , including one general and two colonels ; and they also killed Ito other Chinese . But a haymower can not run backward , and Tex was unable to return with his patrol . They shattered the Chinese attack ; but what was left of his patrol , including Tex , were captured . Tex had two dozen needle-sharp pieces of grenade steel in his back . He administered morphine to himself , and politelyasked permission from the Chinese officer in charge if one of his men could cut out the splinters . The American , who had been a butcher in civilian life , did a very efficient but not too delicate job . Consequently , Tex 's back was marked by a fantastic tangle of scars . Several tiny bits of Chinese steel had been left in his flesh by the amateur surgeon . On extremely cold nights they felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frantic desire to scratch them out . Tex escaped from a Communist aid station and returned to the American lines . His regimental commander had recommendedTex for the job of Observer with the French forces operating outside of Hanoi . Later , when the Korean fighting was still in the skirmish stage , Tex went to Vietnam . The French major laughed , and Wolchek turned toward him . " Tex , you must excuse me if I use your nickname from the very start , " Monet said , " but this is a pretty informal situation , and we might just as well get used to it . Also , I have some bad news for you . Your orders attach you to my  --  118  --  The Iron of Warcompany and call for you to drop into Dien Bien Phu with us . " " What 's wrong with that ? " Tex asked . " Although the newspapers do n't know it , yesterday Dien Bien Phu was completely encircled . There was some talk of relieving it over land , but this has been abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop the day after tomorrow . Even if our High Command would be willing to have a foreign observer drop with our troops , I 'm sure that under the circumstances at Dien Bien Phu , you would prefer to remain here . " " Major , " Tex said , " how many jumps have you made ? " Monet was busy with the papers , and he answered without looking up . " About two dozen . " " And how many have you made under enemy fire ? " " None . There has never been an opportunity . " " Major , I 've made over a hundred practice jumps and I 've jumped five times into enemy fire , " Tex said softly . " Maybe you 'll need an experienced hand along . " Monet looked up from his desk and his eyes went to Tex 's upper left-hand breast pocket looking for the parachuter 's insignia . There were no medals of any kind on the shirt . Over Monet 's face there came an expression which Tex recognized as a look of humiliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am very sorry , " Monet said , his voice just barely under control . " There was no way of knowing . I would be very glad if you would jump with us ; and I 'll make sure that the notification to headquarters of your jump does n't leave this office until our plane is in the air . " Tex and Monet spent the next two days together in Hanoi . In almost all ways they were opposites ; but they did have an important thing in common  --  they both saw themselves as0 119 0The Ugly Americansoldiers and as fighters . Monet came from a family in which there was always at least one son who was a graduate of St. Cyr ; in the last three centuries there had been no war in which France had fought in which a Monet had not been a general . Monet was infinitely sophisticated in the art and literature of war . As the two of them went from bar to bar looking for bottles of Hennessey , and from one munitions dump to another gathering materials for their drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tex was enchanted . They argued about theory ; and both of them worried about the drop into Dien Bien Phu . On the second day Monet took Tex to visit his company of Foreign Legionnaires . The men were lined up for inspection . Tex understood at once that this was a professional outfit ; and he also became aware that the men had an enormous respect for Monet . Like any good officer , he always saw that his men were fed and housed before he himself ate or slept ; but more than that , the men had been through action with Monet and knew he was courageous and decisive . Monet was the only French legionnaire . Among the men were middle-aged blonde soldiers who had been officers in Hitler 's army . There were also Poles , Ukrainians , Russians , Argentinians , and even a few Britons . In the middle of one of the lines stood a tall , skinny Negro ; and something about his face at once attracted Tex 's attention . He stopped and looked sharply at the man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the honor to inform you that among your troops is at least one American , " Tex said in a sharp voice . " Maybe this man told you he was an African or something like that , but I can tell you right now that he 's really an American . "  --  120  --  The Iron of WarThe tall Negro smiled , but kept his lips firmly together . Tex knew at once that he was right . " I would n't know , Major Wolchek , " Monet said quickly , speaking formally in front of the men . " All I know is that this man is a very good soldier . There is a tradition in the Legion that we do not make inquiries about a man 's back-ground . " " Well , there 's a tradition among Americans that they shake hands whenever they meet one another , " Tex said . He stuck his hand out toward the Negro , and for a tense moment the two men stared at one another . Then the Negro smiled , and his hand came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the two Americans spoke briefly and with enthusiasm . The soldier 's name was Jim Davis , and he was from Los Angeles . He had gone to UCLA for three years , and had joined the Legion just to see what the excitement was all about . Tex knew at once that he was a man who , for the same reasons that drove Tex and Monet , wanted to be a soldier . They talked for perhaps two minutes . Then the French major moved , and instantly Davis snapped back to attention , saluted , and his face became immobile . Tex and Monet continued their walk down the columns . Tex decided that it would be silly to tell Monet how he had recognized Davis was an American  --  that he had noticed that when Davis had heard Wolchek 's Texas accent , the trace of an unfriendly smile had flitted across his face . Tex had stopped to make sure that the next smile would be friendly . " Davis is a good man , Tex , " Monet said when they were back at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vietnamese natives love him , despite their hate for our French North African troops . We have a couple of Viets permanently as  --  121  --  The Ugly Americansigned to the regiment as guides , and Davis is the only man they 'll make a night patrol with . He 's never lost a Viet yet , and he always comes back with good intelligence . " The next morning the entire company drove in lorries to the airfield to load aboard the planes that would drop them over Dien Bien Phu . The moment they passed through the guard post , Tex knew that something had gone wrong . The guards were tense , officers were excited , too many planes were lined up on the hardtops , too many men were standing around . Tex said nothing to Monet , but he knew the French officer also sensed trouble . A half-hour later Monet discovered what was wrong . He came walking back from the headquarters building , accompanied by a man who was wearing khakis , but who was obviouslyan American and a civilian . His face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lorries in the shade , took one look at him , scrambled to their feet , and even came to attention . Monet walked up to his group of men and came to a stiff attention . " Last night , " Monet said flatly , " Dien Bien Phu fell . There is no possibility of relief , and all radio communication has been cut off . It is the judgment of higher command , a judgment in which I concur , that we have completely lost the battle . " Tex felt admiration which was mixed with pity . Monet had guts . Most officers would have sugar-coated the pill . Also , Monet had the intelligence and integrity to identify himself with the melancholy news which had to come down from higher command . Tex had learned that officers who dissociate themselves from higher commands are invariably poor officers . Monet walked over to Tex and introduced the tall man . " Major Wolchek , this is Gilbert MacWhite , the American  --  122  --  The Iron of WarAmbassador to Sarkhan , " Monet said stiffly . Tex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacWhite is on temporaryduty from Sarkhan to see how Communists operate . He had managed to obtain a laissez passer from our officials , and was planning to go to Dien Bien Phu . Now he would like our views on why we lost the battle . " Tex looked sharply at the ambassador . He felt a quick flash of anger , and then realized it was groundless . . . there was no way for the man to know . " Major , " Tex said , " why do n't you let me talk to the ambassador while you get the troops started back . " Monet flashed Tex a look of gratitude and spun on his heel . He started to bark out commands . The Legionnaires filed back into the lorries . One after another the lorries roared , and then crawled into the line of retreating vehicles . " Mr. Ambassador , I understand your interest . . . " Tex began . " Just call me MacWhite , " the tall man said . His voice was crisp and assured . " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know why the French are losing . Neither do they . But Monet is not the man to talk to . He 's dying right on his feet from mortifica-tion . " " All right . I 'm asking you , not him , " MacWhite said . " What are we doing wrong ? " In the next few minutes , Tex discovered that MacWhite understood tactics and fighting . He asked tough questions and expected hard answers . They stood on the side of the road , in the midst of exhaust fumes and dust , talking strategy and tactics . " There just is n't any simple answer , " Tex finally said.  --  123The Ugly American " We 're fighting a kind of war here that I never read about at Command and Staff College . Conventional weapons just do n't work out here . Neither do conventional tactics . " " Well , why do n't we start using unconventional tactics ? " MacWhite asked . " Apparently the Communists have some theory behind what they 're doing . " " Armies change slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanks and planes and cannons are n't worth a damn out here . We need to fight the way they fight . . . but no one is quite sure how they fight . " From behind them came Monet 's voice . " Well , we 're going to find out in a hurry . The Communists will keep moving in on Hanoi ; and we 'll have plenty of chance to see them in operation . " " I 'll stick around for a few weeks , then , " MacWhite said . " Do n't worry , Major Monet , I 'll get the proper orders , and you wo n't have to be concerned about my safety . " " Why do you want to watch all this ? " Monet asked . " Because it may happen next in Sarkhan and I want to be ready for it , " MacWhite said , simply . For a long moment the three men stood quietly in the sea of dust , with the smell of defeat all about them . " All right , let 's go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can overtake the lorries . We 've already got orders to occupy a defensive position for tonight . " In the next few weeks the Communists seemed to come sweeping in from everywhere . The tangled , dirty , pathetic mass of refugees grew in Hanoi . Monet and his company of Legionnaires went slashing into the attack at least two dozen times . They would get a report that the Communists were moving up on a distant village . The company of Legionnaires  --  124  --  The Iron of Warwould swoop into the village and take up a well-planned deploymentaround it . Tex , who had seen it done a hundred times , had no criticism of their communications , armament , or training . But always the deployment was a failure . And always it was a failure for one of two reasons . Either the Communists knew the defensive deployment made by the Legionnaires perfectly , and would shell them with horrible accuracy , or , even more horribly , would send squads of two or three men , armed only with knives , and hand grenades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would harass them from the rear with carbine and grenade fire . And the moment the Legionnaires turned to meet this fire , they would be fired on from another position . The Legionnaires fought with enormous courage , and Monet used them with an incredible skill ; but each time they lost . Over a period of several weeks , Tex had the experience of serving with a company of seasoned and experienced fighters under skilled leadership , who lost twenty villages to the enemy . But even more frustrating than constant defeat was the fact that at the end of three weeks of fighting , they had not once seen the enemy . The fire-fights always took place at night and were over by dawn ; the enemy always slipped away , taking his dead with him ; and the men felt they had participatedin phantom engagements . The only thing that made it real were the dead Legionnaires . Meanwhile , Hanoi had become a sick city- . It was full of confusion and hunger and swept by fantastic rumors . The worst thing of all was the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , French , and American . One day , after three weeks of desperate , exhausting patrols and futile defenses , Tex had a long and relaxed afternoon  --  125  --  The Ugly Americanwith Monet and MacWhite . The Legionnaires had been given a rest period of two days ; by the afternoon of the second day Monet had solved all his problems of supply , and was prepared to rest . Tex was cautiously and carefully beginning to talk to Monet about an idea he had had . " Monet , have you ever had a nightmare and had the feeling that it was something you 'd gone through before ? " Tex asked . " When I was a kid I remember having a nightmare about leaving a range fence open and letting ten thousand cattle get loose . In the nightmare I sat stupidly and watched the cattle escape because somehow I had the impression that it had all been planned long before and that I was helpless . " Both Monet and MacWhite turned and looked with a puzzled air at Tex . They were sitting in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very strong cognac . " Yes , I 've had a sensation like that at times , " Monet said . " For example , right now ; I feel I 'm living in a nightmare , but I do n't know what the plan or key to it is . " Tex was encouraged by Monet 's words . " You 're right this has been one long goddam miserable nightmare . It 's like trying to fight a mountain of syrup blindfolded . Look , Monet , you handle men well . You know how to deploy them and how to use fire power and how to run a real hot fire-fight . By all the rules of the classic western warfare you ought to be winning ; but you 're not . And I know why . " Monet was looking at Tex with dawning anger . " It does n't have a thing to do with the quality of the French fighting , or with your Legionnaires , " Tex said quickly and carefully . " It 's just that the Communists are fighting by a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's taken me almost  --  126  --  The Iron of Wara month to remember that I once read it . When I was in Korea , I picked up a book by Mao Tse-tung . Now , Monet , do n't kid yourself about this . Mao is one hell of a bright guy . I hate what he stands for , but he does have a kind of genius . " " I 've never read Mao 's military writings , " Monet said wearily . " But everything that can be written on war was alreadywritten long before him . Clausewitz and Jomini went over the whole thing . It 's impossible to write anything new on war . " " Maybe Tex is right , Monet , " MacWhite said slowly . " Mao is a clever man . I 've read his political things . He 's a Cotnmunistto his fingertips , and he 's also a shrewd student of men . The kind of fight he made in China may have become the model by which all Asian Communists fight . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt very much that Mao has written anything new about war , " Monet said . Tex sighed . He understood that Monet did not want to be forced to learn a new kind of warfare . " All right , " Tex said , " maybe you 're right . I have n't studied military history the way you have . Listen while I run over some of the ideas that Mao had in his book , and then tell me where he found them . First of all , take this thing of always finding some of the enemy in your rear . What Mao said to do is send a couple of agents ahead into any village in which the Communists conceivably might fight . If possible these agents should be men who come from that village . They settle down in the village and live like everyone else , except that they have a few sacks of hand grenades and a few burp guns which they keep hidden . While they 're there , they line up the villagers  --  127  --  The Ugly Americanwho arc sympathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the line : fight with us or die . It 's as simple and direct as that . " Monet was listening , and nodding occasionally . " Monet , whenever the Legionnaires go into a village , there are already a half-dozen of the enemy behind them . These enemydo n't wear uniforms ; they do n't even dig their weapons up until the critical moment has arrived . But can you imagine the advantage that just five or six people in their position give you in a fire-fight ? Imagine if you could have a half-dozen of your own men , looking exactly like the Communists , operatingback of their lines ? " " What else does Mao say ? " Monet asked . He took a cigarette from a pack and lit it . For eight hours and a bottle and a half of cognac , they discussedMao 's military strategy and tactics . Both Tex and MacWhitefelt that Monet was several times at the point of admittingthat they should try Mao 's tactics . But he always stiffened and fell back on arguments about Clausewitz and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " even though his tone of voice showed he did not fully believe them . Finally he stared at them , his face pale . " That 's enough , gentlemen , " he said in a soft voice . " Even if you 're right we do n't have time to change our tactics . We 're losing too fast . " He stared down into the glass of cognac and spoke in a voice that was almost inaudible . " Imagine a nation which produced Napoleon , Foch , and Lyautey being beaten by so primitive an enemy . " " But , Monet , do n't be a fool . . . " Tex began . " He 's right , Tex , " MacWhite said sharply . " We 've talked enough . "  --  128 - The Iron of WarTex wheeled on MacWhite , and then paused . MacWhite 's face was full of warning . Tex realized MacWhite was right . At that moment , Monet was beyond convincing . Ten minutes later a runner came in with a message for Monet . The final stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill country and plains behind Hanoi thousands of Communists were slipping over paddies , around rocks , down ravines . For Monet and Tex and MacWhite and the Legionnairesthe next three weeks were unmitigated hell . Monet tried to send MacWhite back , but he would n't go . The Legionnaireslacked munitions , food , and reinforcements ; and most of all they lacked sleep . Their eyes were redrimmed and tender , and their tempers were drawn thin . They suffered fifty per cent casualties , and then the survivors again suffered fifty per cent casualties . They fought in the thick brown mud around the paddies ; when a man was hit he simply slid under and disappeared forever . Mud-clogged rifles ceased to function , and there was never an adequate base on which to mount a mortar . The least ill of the men had dysentery ; it was a shared minimum affliction . Some of the men had fever , some hookworm , and some had huge horny scabs on their arms . There was never enough to eat , and they had long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank whatever water was available , and accepted the agonizing cramps . Both Monet and Tex were injured . Monet had taken a burp gun bullet in his left elbow ; after the bones had been set , he continued to command the company . Tex was hit by hand-grenade fragments in the buttocks ; with a sigh he told the French corpsman not to bother taking a probe to him . Tex now had the iron of three wars in his body and in some dim way he knew he had expected to all along.  --  129  --  The Ugly AmericanOne day Monet changed his mind about using Communist tactics . He changed his mind because the Viet Communists played a trick . It was not much of a trick . Things like it had happened before and would happen again , and it was , Monet knew , a trick that the French were not above using . But this was the first time it had ever happened to Monet 's men . Jim Davis and a Viet the Legionnaires had nicknamed Apache had been sent out to patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were defending . They left at dusk and were to return at dawn . They carried only burp guns and a signal flare gun . They returned at dawn , but without their weapons , crawling up to the edge of the first CP on their bellies . MacWhite , Tex , and Monet saw them suddenly stand up and start to walk into the village . Mud dripped from their clothes , and there was something about their huddled posture which indicated that something had happened . The three men walked out to meet them . Davis was leading Apache . From fifty yards they could see that there was a gout of blood on Davis 's cheek . At twentyfiveyards they could see the mangled remains of his left eye , hanging in a cluster of tiny glistening cords and muscles . The dead eye hung level with Davis 's nose , and seemed to be staring at the ground . His right eye was firm and brilliant in his black face , and was burning with rage . " What happened , Davis ? " Monet asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his voice was low and cool . " There has to be a first time for everything and this time they caught us . They let us go , but first they had to play a trick . Part of the trick was gouging out my eye . "  --  130  --  The Iron of War " What did they do to you , Apache ? " Monet asked quickly in Vietnamese . Apache 's eyes were glazed and almost shut , narrowed into slits of purest agony . He opened his mouth , wet his lips with his tongue , and made a sound which came out a subhuman , mutilated , horrible twisted moan . " Shut up , Apache , " Davis screamed , and the sound trailed off and stopped . Davis reached over and pulled Apache 's hand away from his throat . Squarely in the center of his throat there was a twisted hole . Far back in the hole the muscles and cords of his neck glistened . Blood welled out of the bottom of the jagged wound . " They cut away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost casual . " It 's a treatment they save for Victs who help the French . " " They left my right eye so that we could find our way back and show ourselves as a lesson to others , " Davis said . His good eye rolled slowly back in his head , and he pitched forward in a faint . Monet caught him , twisted him around , and laid him on his back . " Tex , send for a corpsman , " Monet said softly . " And then you and MacWhite join me in the CP . We 're going to fight tonight using Mao 's tactics against his own people . I 'm con-vinced. "  --  131  --  12The Lessons of WarThe next day MacWhite went back to Hanoi to look for a copy of the booklet on war by Mao Tse-tung , and Monet ordered the Legionnaires to relax . They biv- ouacked in a dirty little group of tents ; the Legionnaires , with- out taking off their clothes , dropped in the shade of the ragged tents and slept like men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacWhite returned with the Mao pamphlet . His method of procuring it had been simple : he had stopped at the first newsstand he saw and asked the pro- prietor to get him a copy . The proprietor , obviously alarmed , said that he knew nothing of works by Mao . MacWhite did not argue with him . He merely said that if the pamphlet were delivered in two hours he would pay the sum of 800 piasters , and no questions asked . Within an hour he had the pamphlet . The three of them gathered in Monet 's tent and MacWhite read aloud for an hour and a half . Neither MacWhite nor Tex looked at Monet during this session . The words in the pam- phlet destroyed a way of life and a tradition in which Monet believed deeply . Monet did not stir during the reading . He  --  132  --  The Lessons of Warsat with his hands together in his lap as if by holding himself together physically he could compensate for the destruction of part of his world . When MacWhite had finished there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mao is right and we have been wrong , " Monet said in a steady voice . " Please , let 's not talk any more about our traditions . Let us talk about what part of Mao 's writings we can use to our advantage . " " Most of what Mao recommends is too long-range for us to use , " MacWhite said . " It 's the kind of thing you have to accomplish over years . For example , when he recommends sending political organizers ahead of the army , he is talking in terms of years . These organizers never announce that they 're Communists ; they just keep putting the views of the Communists before the villagers . Then when the fighting starts they organize resistance behind the enemy lines and disrupt as much as possible . " " That explains why we keep getting fire from both the front and rear whenever we have a night fire-fight , " Tex said . " Also it explains why they always have perfect intelligence on the village which we are attempting to defend , " Monet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your area , gentlemen , " MacWhite said . " I suggest we forget everything that 's going to take a year to accomplish . We have only a few days . Later and in another country perhaps we can use Mao 's strategy . Right now we have to concentrate on his tactics . " For hours they argued over the pamphlet . Night came , they ate a cold meal from packaged rations , crawled under the mosquito nets , and continued their discussion until dawn.  --  133  --  The Ugly AmericanFrom the dozens of ideas which Mao had suggested , they took two . In rough terrain , Mao said , retreat and disappear until the enemy is strung out in pursuit . Then concentrate on one weak point . Time , space , and retreat are the instruments of combat victors . When fighting an enemy who has superior equipment and numbers , success lies in mobility and the use of darkness . The second idea involved guerilla warfare . Mao suggested that in a sustained guerilla action , the groups of guerillas can only be successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central command post directing guerillasin operation should never be further from the actual fightingthan a man can trot in a half hour . Monet said , " It 's obvious  --  even though we 've never used it . " MacWhite put down the pamphlet . He grinned at Monet and Tex , and they began to smooth a large detailed map of the Hanoi Plain out on the table . The village they decided they were looking for was locatedin the midst of a swamp of paddies ; two miles beyond it was a large area of firm ground on which stood a clump of bamboo trees . Both Monet and Tex nodded when they saw it . Any field commander would be insane to choose any spot for a command post other than the bamboo trees . A hardtop road ran like an arrow from the trees directly through the village . And , best of all , just before the village was a small hill behind which the reserve troops could be hidden . " All right , gentlemen , that village will be it , " Monet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days from today we 'll try to cure our illness with the hair of the dog that bit us . " It was Tex who suggested the surprise weapon . He had  --  134  --  The Lessons of Warseen it used once in Korea with great success . It was quite simple . The bed of a large truck was covered with a thick layer of sheet iron to which were fastened the barrels of twenty 5-inch rocket launchers arranged so that when the rockets were fired simultaneously they all fell in a circle roughly a hundred yards in diameter . Tex assured the other two men that there was very little chance that anyone would remain alive inside the circle . On the fourth day they made the move up towards the village . For the first time in weeks the Legionnaires were laughing and joking . Monet left with an advance guard of two lorries of men . A half-hour later MacWhite and Tex set out with the main body of troops . Tex rode on the rocket truck and was in radio communication with Monet . MacWhite was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As dusk fell , the main body moved off the highway on to a road that cut across the paddy fields . Tex called Monet on the radio to make sure he had reached his position . Monet 's voice came in clearly . " We 're deployed to the south of the village , " he reported . " Two Viets left the village a half-hour after we set up positions . They were walking north , but I 'd guess they 've circled back and are heading for the bamboo grove . It should be another hour before anything happens . " The main body of lorries proceeded as quietly as possible . Tex deployed them in a long line behind the hummock which separated them from the village , and they sat down to wait . Almost an hour later they heard thin far-away rifle fire , followed by the chatter of a heavy machine gun . Monet 's voice came up on the radio . " I think they 've fallen for the bait . They probably think  --  135  --  The Ugly Americanwe 're weak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road from the bamboo grove . Just the first patrols have hit so far . They have n't used machine guns yet , although we 've opened up with our 50-calibres . Take a weapons carrierwith a quadruple 50-calibre machine gun mount on it , and cut your way through the troops on the road . Then make straight for the command post . " " We 're on our way , " Tex said , and clicked the receiver off . Moving fast , Tex ordered the quadruple mount 50-calibre vehicle to the head of the column . Directly behind it was a lorry of riflemen . Third in line was the rocket truck . " Leave your lights off until the machine gun fires , " Tex ordered softly . " Then open up with everything you 've got . As soon as the rockets fire , get the quadruple mount turned around for the run back on the road . If we have to leave any vehicle we 'll leave the rocket truck , so I do n't want any men on it after it fires . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vehicles can move . At fifty-yard intervals Monet 's men were marking the right-hand shoulder of the road with shielded flashlights . The column did not reduce speed when it reached the village , but ground steadily past the tiny thatched houses . Suddenly they were out of the village and on the plain . Tex was sitting beside the driver of the quadruple mount vehicle , peering ahead . He saw a blur of frantic motion on the road , leaned back , and calmly ordered the machine gunner to fire straight down the road . The quadruple mount went off with an enormous racket ; four streams of tracer rows poured ahead . At the same momentTex switched on the carrier 's lights . Fifty yards in front  --  136  --  The Lessons of Warof them were a group of about fifty Vietminh troops . They froze , as if bewildered by the light ; then , in a collective rush , they headed for the right-hand side of the road . The machine gun swung with them and the bullets hit . Clots of mud , shreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . The bodies of the men pitched off the road into the ditch . Although the vehicle was moving fast , and took no more than seconds to close the gap , the action was like a brilliantly-illuminated nightmare in slow motion . Then the wheels of the vehicle bumped over the bodies of three men who had fallen on the road , and they were past the enemy group . A moment later Tex heard the rifles on the lorry begin to open up . The machine gun clicked off above his head . Tex left the lights on , and they roared down the narrow road . Ile had only two things in his mind . First , he was praying that the road would support the weight of the column . Secondly , he was calculating exactly when the rocket truck would be 500 yards from the grove of bamboo trees . The night before he had measured the distance at which headlights would first pick up bamboo trees in total darkness . It measured out at 600 yards . If he drove at twenty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the bamboo trees , the rocket truck should be 50o yards from the grove . At that moment the headlight touched the white and green stalks of a mass of bamboo trees . " One , two , three , four , five . . . " Tex counted aloud . At ten , he stood up , and at fifteen gave the signal to the rocket carrier . Two things happened almost instantly . The truck came to a shrieking halt  --  and while it was still moving slightly , the rockets let go . For a second the entire truck looked as if it were on fire , and the hissing sound was deafening . Then  --  137  --  The Ugly Americancame a cleaner sound from the zip of rockets cutting through the air . Two seconds later they hit . There were flashes of light among the bamboo trees  --  and then , in one great yellow patch of fire , the grove exploded . For several seconds the cone of flame hung over the grove , and in it the bodies of halfa-dozenmen turned like puppets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast harsh sound of things returning to earth . " All right , dammit , let 's get this carrier turned around , " Tex shouted . The driver backed and filled in quick , desperate jerks . In less than a minute he was edging around the rocket truck to get back to the road . " There 's no need to abandon the truck , " Tex said to the driver of the rocket truck as they passed . " Back it down the road with your lights off . You 'll be able to see where you 're going from our rear lights . When you get to the village you can swing around and drive out . " They rumbled heavily back down the road . The fire-fight around the village had stopped completely . Later Monet told Tex that when the grove exploded , the Viet Minhs had instantlystopped firing and had scattered . They paused in the village only long enough to pick up the advance guard ; and then the entire group headed back toward Hanoi . " I never heard such damn nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said harshly to Tex . " First you violate the rules of war by engaging in combat when you 're supposed to be a neutral observer . And then you have the gall to come  --  138  --  The Lessons of Warin here and tell a bunch of experienced general officers how to run their war . " Tex , MacWhite , and Monet were seated in three chairs at one end of a large conference table in a room on the third floor of the Citadel in Hanoi . At the other end of the table were two French Admirals , four French generals , and the American who had just spoken . " General , I was not personally engaged in combat , " Tex answered quietly . " All I did was ride along in the carrier . I did n't touch a weapon . I did n't fire a shot . What I was doing is permissible under the rules which govern the conduct of neutral observers . " " Now look here , Wolchek , do n't try to play cute with me , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and tell me that some Frenchman dreamed up that idea of the rocket truck . I 've been around here . .. " The senior French general cut in with a chill voice . " General , we are not interested in the problem of the neutralityof your observer . What interests us more is this fantasticsuggestion made by Major Monet and Ambassador MacWhitethat the French army revise its operations in accord with the military writings of a Communist bandit . " " General , as you know I was the one who requested this session , " Gilbert MacWhite said calmly . " Since December of 1946 the French have been fighting a war which has been maneuvered by the Communists precisely along the lines which Mao outlined in this pamphlet . You are a military man  --  you will please excuse my bluntness  --  but you made every mistake Mao wanted you to . You ignored his every lesson for fighting on this type of terrain . You neglected to get the po  --  139The Ugly Americanlitical and economic cooperation of the Vietnamese , even though Mao proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have one simple  --  and possibly embarrassing  --  question . Has any of you ever read the writings of Mao Tse-tung ? " There was a moment of silence . The senior French general , a man of wisdom and excellent connections , turned slightly red . The other French generals blanched . MacWhite leaned forward in his chair waiting for an answer . " If you are suggesting , Ambassador MacWhite , that the nation which produced Napoleon now has to go to a primitiveChinese for military instruction , I can tell you that you are not only making a mistake , you 're being insulting , " the senior French general finally said . " That 's not what I said , " MacWhite answered . " I asked if any of you had read Mao ? " " Hell no , they have n't read him , " the American shouted . " And neither have I. " And he bit his lips as if he were keeping himself from sayingmore . MacWhite knew that only his personal fortune and his political connections were keeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacWhite shrugged . " Apparently you gentlemen refuse to use your own eyes and ears . " Monet pushed back his chair and stood up . He was pale and his hands were trembling . " Gentlemen , I am entirely responsible for the operation which we have just described to you , " Monet said in a steady voice . " It contradicts everything that I was taught at St. Cyr and everything that this American general was taught at West Point . But it worked . I tell you , it worked . If I had the  --  140  --  The Lessons of Waropportunity , I would multiply this operation a thousand times . In the months of fighting in Vietnam , it is the only complete victory I have commanded . Multiplied a thousand times it might give us a total strategic victory rather than an unimportanttactical success . If anyone is to be punished , it should be me . But , I beg of you , do not ask me to change my mind on something that my own eyes and my own experience teach me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing to be said , and a nod from the senior French general dismissed the three of them . MacWhite , Monet , and Wolchek left , and without a word headed for the nearest bar . There they paid an outrageous price for two bottles of superior French cognac , and drank in silence . When they had finished the first bottle , MacWhite picked it up by its long narrow neck and with a single blow smashed it on the edge of the table . Then he grinned . " I just felt like doing it , " he said . " Gentlemen , do n't worry about disciplinary action . Nothing is going to happen to you . We have stupid men on our side and we have proud men on our side ; but they would never be allowed to punish you for simply saying that it is possible to learn from an enemy . " A short time after the French evacuated Hanoi . After months of battle , the consumption of mountains of supplies , and the loss of far too many lives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Viet Minhs . In the armistice they agreed to turn over the city of Hanoi to the victorious Communist army . MacWhite , Tex , and Monet were there to see it . The French departed as if they were leaving town for a magnificent and colorful parade assembly . Fifes whistled , drums ruffled , and  --  141  --  The Ugly Americanair was cut by sharp and ancient commands . The uniforms of the Legion were neat and well-pressed , their high paratroop boots were beautifully shined . They marched in straight smart lines through the almost empty streets of Hanoi . The inhabitants of Hanoi looked at the magnificent parade with astonishment . So did Monet , MacWhite , and Tex . This was the parade of a victorious army . Behind the parading troops were lines of huge , fast tanks ; then columns of self-propelled guns , countless trucks filled with squads of men carrying the latest type of American rifles . Overhead an almost endless stream of French planes performed a fly-by . " It 's a beautiful sight to see , " Tex said with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly senseless , " Monet said . " No one bothered to tell the tankers that their tanks could n't operatein endless mud . And those recoilless rifles never found an enemy disposition big enough to warrant shooting at it with them . " When the parade ended , the French tricolor was hauled down from buildings and installations all over the city . The last truck swung around the corner . The square where the three of them stood was silent . No one was in the streets ; and both shutters and doors were locked tight . The Communist vanguard were well-dressed and smart looking troops in Russian trucks . They then saw the first regular Communist soldier arrive  --  an officer on a wobbling bicycle , wearing a padded suit , tennis shoes , and a tiny forage hat . He had a rifle slung over his shoulder . Trotting behind him came a platoon of men dressed in a mixture of uniforms . Some merely wore breech-cloths and what looked like capturedFrench blouses . Many of them were barefooted . Per  --  142  --  The Lessons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had a string of crude hand-grenades tied around their waists . Each of them also carried a rice-bag over his shoulder . " Look carefully , Tex , and tell me if you see what I see , " Monet said in astonishment . " Three of those men are carryingguns made from pipes . " It was true . Three of the men were actually carrying nothing but home-made rifles . Tex had the feeling that he was looking at people who were fighting a war that should have taken place three hundred years before . These men traveled on foot and carried their total supplies on their backs . They looked harmless and innocent , indeed they almost looked comical . But these were the men whom he and Monet had been fighting for months , and whom they had defeated only once . The officer on the bicycle held up his hand . The line of men paused , and then , as fast as the slithering of lizards , they disappeared into doorways and gutters . The street seemed empty except for the officer . Monet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear guard , and were leaving at once . The officer smiled and waved his hand . He shouted something , and at once his men appeared from nowhere and began to move cautiously down the street . Tex was aware that around all of Hanoi a huge , silent , and featureless army of men , each of them no more impressive than these , were oozing into the city which they had conquered . There was no point in staying longer . Far off in the distance they heard the sound of the retreating French Army . " All right , let 's go , " Tex said harshly . " It 's the end of another round , and we 've lost again . "  --  143  --  13What Would You DoIf You Were President ? U Maung Swe probably is the best known journalist in Burma , if not in all Southeast Asia . His name is mentioned wherever the world press is a subject for discussion . U Maung Swe is a college graduate who has spent considerabletime in the United States . He speaks the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War II he was a member of the O. S. S. and fought beside Americans in Northern Burma and Southern China . He is an anti-Communist . In 1954 , at a dinner party in Rangoon in honor of AmbassadorMacWhite , someone said to U Maung Swe , " British prestige certainly is low in Southeast Asia . What about America ? " U Maung Swe said , " Poor America . It took the British a hundred years to lose their prestige in Asia . America has managed to lose hers in ten years . And there was no need for it . In fact , she could get it all back in two years , if she wanted  --  144  --  What Would You Do ? to . " In the discussion which followed , U Maung Swe answered these questions : What in general has caused America 's loss of prestige ? The Americans I knew in the United States were wonderfullyfriendly , unassuming , and interested in the world . No one who has ever visited America and come to know the countrycould fail to trust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans I meet in my country are not the same as the ones I knew in the United States . A mysterious change seems to come over Americans when they go to a foreign land . They isolate themselves socially . They live pretentiously . They 're loud and ostentatious . Perhaps they 're frightened and defensive ; or maybe they 're not properly trained and make mistakes out of ignorance . I 've been to Russia , too . On the whole , I have small regard for the Russians as a people . But individual Russians I meet in Burma make an excellent impression . One does not notice them on the street too often . They have been taught our local sensitivities , and usually manage to avoid abusing them . And they all speak and read our language and have no need for Burmese interpreters , translators , and servants ; so no Burman sees their feet of clay . Can you be a little more specific on some of the things which Americans do which annoy the Burmans ? Yes . Frankly , for quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , none of us enjoyed the way your economic people in Burma conducted their daily lives . Almost all of them arrived with the apparent impression that they had full ambassadorial rank  --  all chiefs and no indians , as you say.  --  145  --  The Ugly AmericanEven clerks acted as if they were chiefs of mission . The wages of servants , the rentals of houses , rose to fantastic prices ; and your privates lived better than our generals , so to speak . That hurt our pride . All we saw was tinsel . A few years ago we heard a lot of talk about how the United States aid was going to help Burma . Hordes of United States press agents  --  all on the government payroll  --  swarmed to Rangoon to shout from the housetops about what a wonderful thing United States aid was for Burma . Maybe there was lots of aid : but the people never saw it ; and a few of the things in which the press agents rubbed our noses did n't pan out well . Can you remember any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of fanfare over a three-quarter of a million dollar dredge the United States was bringing to Burma . This mobile floating dredge , the press agents shouted , would be a great boon for Burma . It was going to dredge rivers so that transportation and trade could flourish in inland areas which had never been within reach of markets before . This was something the country really needed , and we were delighted at the prospect . Middle-class farmers upstream hoped to have an outlet for their produce ; boat builders were instructed to draw plans for The Prime Minister himself was persuaded by the Americans to come to see its arrival . The local press sent reporters and photographers . USIS came down with tape recorders so that the event could be broadcast on the radio.  --  146  --  What Would You Do ? Well , when the dredge was towed into the harbor it turned out to be a 25-year-old , reconditioned British dredge which had been rusting in Japan . It was a stationary dredge , which needed land connections . This was disappointment enough ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who came with the dredge were unable to get it to work . They even flew some Japanese experts in , but they could n't get it to run either . Everyone involved lost face . Experiences like this made many Burmans doubt the effectiveness of U. S. aid . In 1953 Burma was in critical need of money and technical assistance . Yet you terminated all United States aid . Why did you do this ? In the first place we were offended by the superior airs and what even Americans called the " razzle-dazzle " of the Americansin Burma . Secondly , there were several incidents like that of the dredge ; and although American money was flowinginto Burma , we could n't see that it was helping us very much . And , third , we became very angry over the KMT incident . It all added up to more than Burma was willing to swallowjust to get dollars . What was the KMT incident ? When the Chinese Reds defeated the Nationalists in 1947 , about io , 000 of Chiang Kai-shek 's troops fled from China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country . We were a new nation then , and had so many troubles that we were unable to do much about these alien troops in our territory . The Chinese Nationalist troops were living off the land ; and troops who live off the land in a foreign country have to get money one way or another . These men started  --  147  --  The Ugly Americantrading in opium , and sometimes turned to banditry . In 1952 Chiang Kai-shek began supplying them by air . I can understand his point of view  --  he was trying to harass the Chinese Communists . Nonetheless , his troops had no right to be in our country . Then we learned that they were wearing United States uniforms and using United States equipment . I know that the United States was not supplying them ; Chiang Kaishekwas . Burma wanted to bring the matter up before the United Nations , and America agreed  --  provided that the troops were not identified as Chinese Nationalists and that no mention was made of the American uniforms . And yet , everybody in Southeast Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . They were never told . When we said that we did n't see why the countries involved should n't be named , it was hinted that if they were named , perhaps U. S. aid would be cut off . That was all we had to hear . Even though we were desperatefor economic and technical assistance , we told the Americansto take their aid and go away . It was a matter of prideface , as we Asians call it . Face , incidentally , is an element of our life superbly well understood by the Russians . Would you welcome United States economic and technical assistance now ? Yes . I suggest that technical aid be administered the way the Ford Foundation did it in Indonesia . The Ford people noticed that when they brought their own automobiles to Indonesia , they always had to go to a Dutch garage to have them overhauled . The Indonesians did n't know how to repair cars . When the Ford Foundation later brought a group of Indo  --  148  --  What Would You Do ? nesians to the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study or what kind of equipment they ought to spend their money on , they told the Indonesians to look around and pick out what they felt they needed . The first batch of Indonesians pointed to a garage and said that was what they wanted . A replica of the garage was set up in Indonesia , and American mechanics worked side by side with the Indonesians until the Indonesians were able to operate the equipment and overhaul automobiles by themselves . Then the American technicians went home . That is the kind of help we want . If you were the President of the United States what would you do to improve the prestige of the United States in SoutheastAsia ? Let me tell you a story . Some years ago two Americans  --  a married couple named Martin  --  came to Burma as short-term advisors . They were quiet people about whom nobody seemed to know much , and they quietly went up north to the Shan States , which are pretty wild . They brought no pamphlets , brochures , movies , or any of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on which most Americansrely . They had no automobile and no servants . They just moved into a small town and settled down in a modest house and began living there . Since the Martins spoke Burmese  --  a most unusual accomplishmentfor Americans in Burma  --  Burmans began stopping in at their house and talking with them . These visitors to the Martins ' house were amazed at two things . One was the tremendoussize of the vegetables they were growing in their garden ; and the second was the size of the garden itself . They  --  149The Ugly Americanwanted to know what two people were going to do with such an enormous amount of food . Surely they could n't eat it all  --  and the rest would spoil . Mrs. Martin took them into the kitchen and showed them a small home canning outfit . The Burmans had never seen anything like it , and did n't know what it was . They came around day after day to watch fruit and vegetables being canned . And then , as the months passed by , the Burmans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still edible . These two Americans distributed high-quality seeds to all of the townspeople and helped them organize a community canning plan . The people of the village still do most of the growing individually , and a good deal of the canning is done at home ; but now they not only put up things for their own use , but for all of Burma . This village is the canning center of the nation , and processes meat , vegetables , and many favorite Burmese foods . In this section of the Shan States everyone is pro-American because of the Martins . They came to Burma to help us , not to improve their own standard of living . You do n't need publicity if the results of what you are doing are visible and are valuable to the people . The steam from a pot of good soup is its best advertisement . You asked me what I would do if I were the President of the United States . This is what I would do : I would send more people like the Martins to Burma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the hordes of executives , PX 's , commissaries , and service forces which are now needed to support the Americans abroad . And then , of course , you could save  --  150  --  What Would You Do ? many of the millions of dollars Americans seem to think essentialto any aid program . You implied earlier that the Russians who went abroad seemed to operate effectively . Can you explain why this is ? The Russians are professionals . They keep many of their men in Burma for as long as five years . They all know Burmese . They study quietly and live quietly . They employ no Burmese servants , and hence there is nobody to spread gossip about them . All their servants are Russian . The Russian Ambassador is their social lion . He 's the one who attends the cocktail parties . But that 's about all he does . The Russian team always has a professional expert who not only knows the area thoroughly , but also has authority . Here in Burma it was a man named Victor Lassiovsky . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary . He always opened the door for the ambassador and walked behind him . He did n't waste much time at parties . He was the real tactical leader of the Russian task force , and he ran the entire Burmese effort for Russia . Lassiovsky was recently transferred to Thailand . I predict that America will be having trouble there soon . Is Russian economic aid better than that of the United States ? No , it is not . But it is much more obvious , and so more effective as propaganda . For example , our Prime Minister flies in a Russian transport plane  --  a gift from Stalin . This gift made a deep impression not only on the Burmans , but on all SoutheastAsians . The Russians have promised to build us a sports stadium  --  151  --  The Ugly Americanyou know we 're all sports crazy  --  and also a hospital and a graduate school for engineers and doctors . We do n't have them yet . But these are projects which the people understand and would like to have . And even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists , still , both the man in the street and the young intellectuals discuss what the Russians are doing . Also , the Communists are extremely skillful in their cultural projects . The Tenth Anniversary of our independence was a tremendous celebration . You could compare it to Christmas , New Years , Easter , the Fourth of July , and Purim , all rolled into one . We had great parades . All the Communist nations participated in these parades with floats , acrobats , and folk dancers . They carried big banners congratulating us on our independence from colonialism . There were no marchers from the United States . If any of you Americans ever left Rangoon and went upcountry , you would see that there are Russian circuses and Chinese entertainers everywhere . True , you send some stars like Benny Goodman , and some opera singers , and they 're very welcome  --  but they play only in Rangoon and only a few of the elite get to see them . Oh yes , I forgot , you also had a cut glass exhibit . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a cut glass exhibit . I hope I 've answered your questions . I 'll finish by saying that what America needs in Asia is good , well-trained , and dedicated Americans . They must be well-trained and dedicated . The subordinates can be mediocre , but the leaders must be top-notch , with the ability to make their subordinates fit in with Burmese culture , community habits , and needs.  --  152  --  What Would You Do ? I 've known almost every American ambassador , military leader , top economic advisor , and USIS man sent to Southeast Asia in the last ten years . This includes both career people and amateurs . I can recall only two ambassadors , one USIS leader , and one admiral who were trained and dedicated professionals . Ninety per cent of the Russian executives are professionals  --  no matter what else they may be . You 're bound to lose in competition with them until you learn from them . And yet , I believe firmly that the Americans could drive the Communists out of Asia in a few years if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our level . And if you had a definite policy . But most important  --  act like Americans . We love Americans  --  the kind we meet in America . When the dinner party was over U Maung Swe and Gilbert MacWhite went for a walk . It was one of those soft nights when every sound carries a great distance and the perfume of flowers comes floating in from the jungle . " What about Sarkhan , Maung ? " MacWhite asked . " What should I do ? " " About what ? " " About anything , big or little . " Maung paused for a moment . The breeze brought the sound of distant gongs . " Gilbert , I heard once of an American who was working on a powdered milk plant in Sarkhan , " Maung said . " He planned to develop a taste for milk in the Sarkhanese , and then bring in dairy cattle and set up the business on a sound , self-supportingbasis . No concession for foreigners . The whole thing simpleand easy to run . "  --  153 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reports , " MacWhite said . " Ile got caught in a scandal . Rape or drugging girls . Something like that . " " Gilbert , those were lies . I never met the man , but I took the trouble to find out the truth of his story . The Communists framed him . He spoke Sarkhanese , he was dedicated , and the people liked him . His idea was sound . His name is Colvin ; I think if you brought him back he would do a job for you . " " I 'll do it , if I can get him cleared , " MacWhite said . " They 're little things , perhaps , but ideas like Colvin 's are basic .

First , he was the only American anyone knew of in Cambodia who had spent all of his salary while he was there . Secondly , he knew more Cambodians than any other Westernerin the entire country . Thirdly , his capacity and enthusiasm for Cambodian food was at least three times greater than that of his closest competitor . By the time Tom had been in Cambodia for a year , he was easily the best known American in that country . No village was so small that it had not heard Tom 's booming laugh , seen his prodigious appetite in action , and benefited from his knowledge of chickens . Day after day Tom drove his jeep into the countryside . When the road dwindled into a path , he unslung a collapsible bike from the rear of the jeep , and pedaled off . When the path became impassable by bike , he walked . " Hey there , feller , " Tom would say to the first man he saw in a village . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My name is Tom Knox . Sheldon , Iowa . " Tom would then stick out his huge hand and vigorously pump the small bird-like hand of the Cambodian . Ten minutes later everyone who could walk , hobble , or crawl would be gathered around Tom . He spoke a chaotic mixture of Cambodian , French , and farmyard English . But no one failed to understand him , and everyone valued the sincerityof his efforts to communicate . " Now look here , people , you 've got a chicken problem in this village , " Tom would say . " You 've got a bunch of teeny little scrawny chickens , and I 'll bet you do n't get fifty eggs a year from each one . Now I 'm a chicken raiser from Iowa myself , and we 've picked up a few tricks that I 'm going to pass  --  156  --  American Junior Gradealong to you . But before we do that , I 'd like a little food . " As the group moved off toward the headman 's house to eat , Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a farm boy . In one place he watched the Cambodians take boiling syrup distilled from cane sugar and pour it into big pot-shaped sugar forms . He noticed that when they knocked the sugar out of the forms , they invariably lost a good part of it when they broke it loose . Tom sat down and designed a wooden sugarcakeform with hinges on the bottom which could be swung open so the cake could be removed intact . In another town he watched Cambodians putting piglets in little bamboo cages to take them to market . Usually one or two pigs would hang his head through the bars and strangle on the way to market . Tom , showed the villagers how to tie a twine harness around the chests of the pigs which made it impossible for the pig to strangle . He was no less impressive when the time came to eat . In no time at all he had become a formidable expert on Cambodian food . He could tell the district from which different types of rice came . He knew dozens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with delight when Tom took over the cooking chores . He cooked with the sure hand of an artist ; and whether it were river eel or lake fish , he prepared it expertly . Tom made a point of bringing enough food with him so that despite the enormous quantities that he ate his host was better off after Tom had left . After the meal , Tom turned to business . He would snatch a squawking chicken from the ground , inspect it carefully  --  push back its feathers , look in its eyes , pull its claws wide , and feel for internal damage.  --  157  --  The Ugly American " Now , what this little feller needs is a bit more calcium in its diet , " Tom would say . " Calcium , you know , it 's that white stuff that you get from the earth . I saw a vein of it in a hill just off the trail about a mile back . Take five or six pounds of that and mix it with a hundred pounds of chicken feed , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least it would be a good diet for this chicken . " When the chickens were diseased , Tom either dusted them with powders that he brought , or gave them injections . And he left pamphlets in Cambodian on how to care for the chickensto keep them well . Tom 's success , although minor by the standards by which military aid or big economic aid were calculated , was impressive . Word spread from village to village , until finally Tom 's appearance in a new village became the sign for a carnival . Villagers began storing up prize pieces of fruit , a pot of superior smoked eel , especially good twigs of cinnamon , or a bag of exceptionally good rice in anticipation of Tom 's next visit . And the production of eggs soared rapidly . In fact , Tom got a reputation for working magic with chickens . A scrawny and featherless chicken , at the very edge of death , would revive just from being touched by Tom . Five minutes after he had arrived in a village he could tell almost exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickens ; and he was invariably helpful on other things too . He was a walkingencyclopedia of Cambodian and American folklore on chickens , and there was very little that he did not know about farming in general . One night Tom was sitting in front of the home of the headman of a hillside village . He had worked twelve hours that day with the people of the village . He was pleasantly  --  158  --  American Junior Gradetired , and he watched contentedly as the moon came up and turned the green of the jungle below into a rolling sea of darkness . The broad shaft of silvery moonlight was occasionally broken by a flock of birds like a cloud of motes . The headman came over and squatted silently beside Tom . " Why does a big strong man like you leave his country ? " the headman asked softly and politely . " You are a very good man , but we wonder why you left your own country to come help us . " It was said with infinite courtesy , and Tom knew that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formal lectures delivered to all economic cooperation people abroad on the objectives of foreign aid . He ticked them off in his mind , and then felt disgusted . " Oh , crap ! " he said softly . " What is that word ? " the headman asked just as softly . " Oh , nothing . It 's just an expression of anger , " Tom said . " I could give you a lot of formal answers , but the simple fact is that I just like people and chickens , and besides I wanted to get away from the farm for a year or so . " It was inadequate , but it was the truth . For years Toni had had a dream made up of things so soft and intangible that he had never been able to discuss it . Because of this dream he had never married ; and because of this dream he had come to Cambodia . When he was a small boy , Tom had discovered that certain words meant enchantment to him . Words like " cinnamon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or " IIindu " or " Zamboanga " had magic in them . They suggested strange countries , mysterious reaches of green water , smells that he had never yet smelled , and people he had never yet seen . Later , when he learned what the words meant , he wanted to see the  --  159  --  The Ugly Americanplaces and things for which the words stood . As he grew older he collected other words and stored them deep in his mind . " Raffles Hotel , " " monsoon season , " " upland plantations , " " mahogany forests , " " rice paddies , " " Yellow River , "  --  hundreds of names of places and objects of the Far East . He even learned the meanings of very unusual words like " paryanka , " which is one of the sitting positions in the Buddhist faith . In fact , as he talked to the headman , he was sitting in precisely that posture , and he was fully aware that the headman attached great significance to it . " Look , old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things , " Tom said . " I do not use words very well . But for many years I wanted to see a country like this . So I came and saw it . " " And do you Iike it ? " the headman asked . " Yes , I like it very much , " Tom said . He realized that he had almost said he loved it . " I like the people in the villages , but I do not like the officials in Phnom Penh . And I do not like the ways of the Americans that work for my mission or in our embassy . " " I do not know these people ; but I think that I and my people like a fellow like you very much , " the headman said shyly , but firmly . Tom had been in Cambodia long enough to know that he had just been paid a tremendous compliment . It was one of the happiest nights that he ever spent in Cambodia , or , for that matter , anywhere else . Two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which appraised the results of the American Aid Mission to Cambodia . Tom was not happy . For eighteen months he had been slogging through the jungles and he had  --  160  --  American Junior Gradeformed some definite impressions about what the village people needed . His reports were received by Mission headquarters , but action never seemed to be taken on them . Tom wanted to import a few thousand Rhode Island Reds and other breeds of poultry to improve the Cambodian stock . Tom did not deludehimself . He agreed at the staff meetings that the road from Phnom Penh to the new sea town of Konponga Som would be valuable for the country . He also agreed that the massive canal building program would be useful . he had no objections to the ambitious military plans which the Mission supported . But he kept insisting to everyone who would listen that most of the millions of people in Cambodia lived off the land , and anythingthat would help them to live better  --  even to the extent of a few more eggs a day  --  was the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom met with all the American agricultural experts , the Cambodian experts , and four French officials to review the work of the year and decide what recommendations to make to the conference . Torn listened to a proposal for a new canal to cost two and a half milliondollars , and to another proposal to replace eighteen square miles of mangrove swamp with a mechanized farm . He listened while an American expert proposed the importation of two hundred thousand tons of commercial fertilizer per year for four years . Then the chairman of the conference nodded at Tom . " My recommendation wo n't sound like much after the money we 've been kicking around this table , " Tom said with a grin . " I want to do two little things that wo n't cost much , but will sure as hell help the chicken and egg production of Cambodia . First , I want to bring in a few thousand American chickens and roosters to improve the native stock . Second , I  --  161  --  The Ugly Americanwant a couple thousand dollars to develop a machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tops so that they could be used for chicken feed and for cattle . . . " " Tom , you told us this last year , " the chairman said wearily . " What our two governments want is something big , that really helps people right away . " " Now , look . Three million people in Cambodia live in villagesand what they eat depends on what they can raise themselves , " Tom said , and anger started to rise in his chest . " A big source of protein and meat is chicken and eggs . Oh sure , they can get fish , but not everyone lives near enough . . . . " " Okay , okay , Tom , " the chairman said irritably . " We 've heard that before , and we 've made recommendations . The higher-ups have n't moved on them , and I think we ought to give them up and concentrate on really important things . " Tom 's face turned red and his back started to arch like an angry bull 's . In his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . He remembered their friendliness , their gratitude , their ignorance , their willingness to learn , the pathetic condition of their chickens , the scarcity of their eggs . Suddenly he felt , with a pang of guilt , that he was not representinghis people well . Only later did he come to ask himself why they were his people . Tom smashed his fists on the table , and the entire group looked up with startled faces . " Now , listen , goddamn it , " he roared . " You people have been sitting on your asses here in Phnom Penh and you never get out to see a real person . I 'm telling you right now that if we could increase the egg production of this country two hundred per cent we would do as much to help the average Cambodian as we would by building that damn expensive highway or that canal . Now , I 'm not going to ask you chair-* 162  --  American Junior Gradeborne commandos or the officers here what you think . They 'll agree with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief of the Cambodian Aid Committee . The Cambodian looked at Tom , then glanced quickly around the table . He looked down into his hands , and for several seconds he did not speak . " Well , come on , tell us what you think , " Torn insisted angrily . " You know how the people in the villages live . You know how damn long it will take anything from those highwaysor canals to improve their living standards . What about my chickens ? " " I consider chicken and egg production to be very important , " the Cambodian said carefully . Torn swung around in triumph . " There , I told you ! " " Now do n't get excited , Torn . I 'd like to know what our friend thinks is most important , " the chairman said . " If we have money to develop either the mechanized farms or a chicken program , which would you support ? " Tom knew the question was unfair . The Cambodian government was firmly committed to the mechanized farms , and the expert could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the Cambodian spoke , he did not look up from his hands , and his voice was very low . " I would have to support the mechanized farms , " the Cambodiansaid . The chairman turned to Torn and shrugged . Tom knew that he should keep quiet , but he could not . He felt as if the villagers were his constituents , and if he did n't speak for them now , he would have betrayed their trust . " I 'm going to say something just once , and then I 'm  --  163  --  The Ugly Americanthrough , " he said , his voice , unsteady , low , and dangerous . The chairman 's head came up sharply . " If we do n't get this damn chicken appropriation before the conference , I 'm going to resign and go back to Washington , and raise hell . Unless you fellows get out into the sticks , you wo n't know what the score is . There are a lot of congressmen who know about chickens and farming , and I think I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a threat , and no one at the table misread it . The chairmanstared at Tom while he quickly calculated how his own superiors might react if they were approached by Tom . He decided that they 'd stand firm ; and that in any case , they could rally more support among congressmen than Tom . He smiled . " Okay , Tom , if that 's the way you want it . As of this moment , I accept your resignation unless you want to reconsider . " Everyone in the room was silent . The Cambodians were not only silent , but deeply embarrassed . The Americans only watched curiously . They had seen this kind of thing happen before . Tom got up , looked once more around the table , and left the room . Two weeks later Tom was ready to fly home . He had alreadywritten letters to congressmen from agricultural states and outlined his complaint . He had not yet had replies , but there had not been time for airmail to make the round trip . He firmly intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The day before he left Tom had a visitor  --  a high-ranking French diplomat . The Frenchman explained that he had followedTom 's work carefully and had heard excellent reports from the villages which Tom had visited . He regretted that  --  164  --  American Junior GradeTom had had a difference of opinion with the American chief . Tom listened impassively . " As an indication of our gratitude , would you allow us to route your trip home in such a way that you could visit the rest of the Far Eastern countries , India , the Middle East , and France and England ? " the diplomat asked him smoothly . " I understand that you flew here over the Pacific  --  so you would have traveled around the world by the time you return home . As you know , Cambodia pays for such trips out of counterpartfunds . We would be delighted to have you take this trip . We are embarrassed over your dilemma , and it would be graciousof you to accept . " Tom was both bored and suspicious . He wanted only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he had long ago discovered that when diplomats make a concrete proposalthey usually have some firm objective in mind . As Tom was trying to make up his mind , the Frenchman showed how well he understood American personality . " I have always felt , sir , that you have great sympathy for Asian countries and peoples , " the diplomat said softly . " The trip I 'm suggesting would give you a chance to see thc magnificentold temples in Bangkok . You could stop off in Indonesia , and I 'm sure our diplomatic people in India could arrange for you to see much of that country . It would be a wonderful opportunity . I can tell you from personal experience that there is no sight more stirring than the Taj Mahal in full moonlight . " For Tom it was irresistible . All the exotic words , the suggestions of exotic scenes welled up in his mind . In another five minutes he had agreed , and arrangements were made for Tom to fly to Paris via Air France . The trip home started very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ugly Americanplane carried a reduced passenger load , so that they could be given luxury service . The first meal Tom ate aboard the plane consisted of a generous slice of pate de foie gras , a tiny loaf of French bread , a bottle of champagne , and a large pat of fresh butter which had had his name impressed on it  --  and that was only the beginning . Later he had a huge steak with Bearnaise sauce , with which he was served a half-bottle of a magnificent Chambertin ; a spinach souffle delicately flavored with fresh butter and crushed garlic ; and for dessert , Brie and crackers . At Jakarta in Indonesia , Tom was met by a French Embassy official , and a French merchant . Arrangements had been made for Tom to spend several nights at the embassy residence , and they had outlined an itinerary for him while he was there , of which Tom approved eagerly . That afternoon they took him to a tiny village on the outskirts of Jakarta . Even after the beauty of Cambodia , Tom was staggered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more colors than he had ever seen before poured over fences , hung from trees , and climbed up the walls of the native huts . In the largest of the huts , a troupe of Balinese dancing girls were performing . The girls were tiny , and naked to the waist . Behind their ears they wore large red flowers which were like flames against their jet black hair . The sarong-like wraps they wore emphasized their incredible muscular control . For three hours Tom sat trans- fixed watching the girls dance . The graceful girls seemed utterly boneless . Their bodies flowed into impossible posi- tions , then dissolved into entirely different stances . They danced to an unearthly music played by a line of Indonesian musicians . Tom was very close to tears when he left . He had n't thought about Cambodia the entire afternoon ; and some of the fine edge of his anger had disappeared.  --  166  --  American Junior GradeThat night in the Embassy he was served a banquet in nineteenth-century Indonesian style  --  a rijstta f el . There were twelve people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . First an Indonesian boy brought each guest a huge bowl of boiled rice . Then a procession of servants carried in condiments to be put on top of the rice , each of which was more succulent than the last . When it was time to cat Tom faced a mound of rice almost buried under dozens of fragrant preparations . One of the servants kept his glass full of good strong beer . The moment they started to eat , two girls from the dancing troupe came into the room . They did not dance , but played two tiny stringed instruments which made a high , piercing sound . At first this music was almost unbearably shrill , but after a while took on practically heavenly purity and precision . Both the food and the music were like somethingfrom another world , and Tom several times had to shake off a sense of unreality . It was , he thought , the closest he had ever come to his boyhood dream . The rest of his stay in Jakarta was equally fascinating , and when he boarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some sleep . He awoke eight hours after they had taken off , and was flattered to discover that the French merchant had put a case of imported beer aboard the plane and instructed the steward to serve Tom a bottle as soon as he awoke . By the time he had consumed five bottles of beer the plane was circling for a landing outside of New Delhi in northern India . Indonesia had been lush and rich and bright . India was dusty , hot , and hard . But Tom enjoyed his stay . Again two Frenchmen met him at the airport and arranged for him to stay at a French rest home . They also had planned an elaborate itinerary . Tom visited magnificent cen  --  167The Ugly Americantury-old ruins , watched a troupe of Indian dancers recreate ancient ritual dances which had formerly been done with cobras , and attended a funeral burning at the river edge . Months later he could still recall the smell that rose from the pyre , compounded of ancient butter , strange perfumes , and burning flesh . Tom also ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , again on a luxury flight , he was given a collection of intricate Indian silver jewelry , a gift from the French Embassy of India . And during his entire stay various people made flatteringremarks about his skill in Cambodia . On the long flight from New Delhi to Nice , Tom tried several times to write up his criticisms of the American agriculturalaid program in Cambodia . Somehow he found it difficult to find the right words with which to express his indignation . In fact , he found that his indignation was very difficult to rekindle . He assured himself that once he had returned to the United States he would be able to write up his complaint accurately and soundly ; he resolved to go as quickly as possible to Washington after his return . When his plane landed in Nice he was again greeted by the inevitable Frenchmen . This time they had arranged for him to stay as long as he wanted to in a hotel just outside of Cap d'Antibes . On the rocks below the hotel were a half-dozen women wearing bathing suits smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed seven days at the hotel , and when he left he discovered that there was no bill to pay . The management assured him that both they and the French government were delighted to have had as a guest so distinguished an American diplomat . The Frenchmen from Nice gave him a present when  --  168American Junior Gradehe left  --  a suitcase made of Morocco leather , the finest piece of luggage Tom had ever seen . In Paris Tom was met by a Cambodian who had large agriculturalholdings in Cambodia . He had arranged for Tom to stay at a small hotel . He apologized for the fact that it did not have an international reputation , but assured Tom that the service and food were excellent . This recommendation was something of an understatement . Tom discovered , to his astonishment , that the hotel had no established rates . A guest was simply given whatever he asked for , and was then presented with a single unitemized bill at the end of his stay . When Tom asked for Scotch in the bar , the waiter brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few bottles of Perrier water , and left . For so small a hotel the menu was incredible . Tom literally could order whatever he wanted  --  from fresh Beluga caviar to squid soup . Meanwhile , the Cambodian land owner kept Tom busy with trips to every art gallery in Paris , an evening at the opera , tastings at famous wine cellars , small cocktail parties , carriage rides through the Bois , and a gift-buying expedition which turned out , in some mysterious way , to involve Tom in no expense whatsoever . One evening he tried to raise the question of agricultural aid to Cambodia . The Cambodian listened courteously as Tom described his plans for increasing chicken and egg yield in that country , and Tom had the feeling that the Cambodian already knew the details of his plan . The Cambodian could not have been more honest or diplomatic . " Mr. Knox , I 'm afraid that you and I differ on this idea , " he finally said with great grace . " There is only a limited amount of aid money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  169The Ugly Americanthink it would be wise for Cambodia to get permanent installationslike roads and canals and ports . Your idea is important and good ; but I do not feel that this is the time for it . " Tom started to protest ; but somehow to protest to so polite and generous a person seemed unreasonable . Two days later the Cambodian told Tom that through a lucky fluke they had been able to get him a suite on the Liberte sailing for New York . And happily he was able to tell Tom that the suite would cost him nothing , because , for a reason which was never quite clear to Tom , the suite was free to them . When Tom left his hotel his experience on the Riviera was repeated . The hotel was so pleased to have him as a guest that they could not think of taking payment . The manager pointed out confidentially that other people  --  businessmen and brokers , for instance  --  could well afford to pay the cost of the small services that the hotel had given Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people so valuable and important that they were above paying hotel bills . The suite on the Liberte was luxurious without being ostentatious . Every morning fresh flowers were put in his cabin ; there was always a note attached to them which expressed the gratitude of the Cambodian government . Also , there were several visits from a Cambodian diplomat who was traveling to the United States ; this gentleman made Tom gifts of French wine and a length of the finest French silk . When the Liberte was two days from New York , Tom sat down to write up his thoughts so that he could present them to congressional committees and to newspaper people in Washington . He discovered , however , that not only had his feeling of anger and outrage been blunted , but that it was very difficult  --  170  --  American Junior Gradeto recreate it at all . To his astonishment Cambodia seemed a long , long time away , and glazed over with wonderful memories . These were not so much memories of the village life , as of the generous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his trip home . The anger , which in Cambodia had seemed so sure and honest a weapon , in his suite on the Liberte seemed somehow almost ridiculous . After working for three hours and covering only a half a page , he resolved to wait until he had landed . Eight months later , when Tom was back on the Knox farm in Sheldon , Iowa , he again saw the half page of paper . When he read it over , he thought for a moment that it must have been written by another person . The handwriting was his , but not the words . The anger he had felt in Cambodia , so hot and bright and curiously nourishing , now seemed childish . Tom folded the paper , and put it away.  --  171  --  The Ugly AmericanIn Haidho Ambassador MacWhite had a caller  --  a farmer who was head of the Midwest Poultry Association . He was making a world tour with his wife , and he came into the embassy with something on his mind . " Look , Mister MacWhite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protocol , " I 'm on to something hot . Listen for a second and do n't say I 'm crazy . " MacWhite pushed a box of cigars towards the man . He took four , lit one , and stuck the other three in his shirt pocket . He puffed up a white cloud of smoke and then talked through it . " What this country needs , mister , are some good chickens , " he said , his voice explosive with excitement . " I thought there were plenty around , " MacWhite said cautiously . There was no disapproval in his voice , for he had learned not to be either disapproving or surprised . " Dammed right there are , but they 're sickly , " the visitor said . " I found out they only lay about thirty eggs a year . Why , if we could get their egg production up to zoo eggs per chicken per year , and their weight up just zo per cent , we could save $2,000,000 on food imports a year . Look , I figured it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paper over , to the ambassador . It was covered with a sprawl of figures ; at the bottom , with a circle around it , was written $2,000,000 . MacWhite had the figures checked by his research staff . They were correct.  --  172  --  American Junior GradeHe then wrote a letter to the American Aid Mission in Phnom Penh in Cambodia , which had the largest number of American agricultural experts of any mission in the immediate area . He asked if they had a chicken expert they could lend to the Sarkhan government . The letter he received from Phnom Penh was disappointing and it also led to MacWhite 's making his second major mistake  --  onehe never discovered . Dear Ambassador MacWhite , ( wrote the Chief of Mission in Phnom Penh ) I do n't know what you 're doing down there , but it sounds as if you 're trying to make sure of a good eggnog supply for the Christmas holidays . Whatever your motives , I ca n't help you . We had an egg expert out here , name of Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to make them a bit odd . He just did n't work out . Always out in the countryside , always popping off about things he knew nothing about , always threatening to go to Congress if we did n't import some Rhode Island Reds . He finally left in a huff , why , I never fully understood . The French and Cambodian officials were a bit perturbed at first becausethey hate to have Americans go away unhappy ; but they seem all right about it now . They do n't want any more egg experts though . Neither do you . Give it up . CordiallyRowe IlendyAnd MacWhite did give it up  --  which was his second major mistake.  --  173  --  15The Six-Foot Swamifrom SavannahPlaying his harmonica softly , Colonel Edwin B. Hillandale of the U. S. Air Force and Savannah , Georgia , ambled down the Street of the White Crocodile in Haidho . He was trying to learn Nging Gho Hrignostina , which is Sarkhan 's national anthem . Every few minutes the colonel would stop a Sarkhanese and play a version of Nging Gho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughter , he would persuade the Sarkhanese to hum the anthem . But learning the national anthem of Sarkhan was n't the only thing the colonel was doing . He was , as he expressed it , " Seeing what makes this burg tick before MacWhite comes back from his trip . " Ambassador MacWhite had gotten him on loan from Manila for two months . The colonel noticed that there were a great many pawnshops , and concluded that the city people were in bad economic straits . He observed the shops which sold betel nuts , tobacco , and native medicines . He had seen a clerk in one of them pass something from under the  --  174  --  Six-Foot Swamicounter , and had guessed that opium was also being sold . He went by fruit stands piled high with red pomegranates , yellow pomolos , pink-brown bananas , and green apples , and passed walking flower vendors carrying great baskets of sweet fragrance . The thing which the colonel noticed most , however , was the large number of signs advertising palmistry and astrology establishments . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made them resemble the offices of fashionable physicians in America . And the shingles which the astrologists and palmists hung outside their places of businessall indicated that these practitioners had doctors ' degrees . Well , thought Colonel Hillandale , at last I 've found a place where my hobbies will be welcome . I 'm sure glad I brought my Ephemeris and log tables with me . And that slide rule . Oh boy , if I can find my diploma from that Chungking School of Occult Science , I 'll really be in business here . He then played The Little Whistling Pig on his harmonica , a tune he reserved only for special occasions such as the day he had put the donkey in the general 's suite , or last March the 4th , when he had been promoted to full chicken colonel . After he had seen enough of Haidho to get the feel of it , he returned to the American Embassy and began to read . He went through biographies 0f all the Sarkhanese politicians , and many different analyses of the current political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , and probably would have continued for longer except that he was interrupted by the Embassy Protocol Officer . " Colonel , is your nickname The Ragtime Kid ' ? " " That 's what they call me in Manila . " " Then you 're the one . The Philippines Ambassador is giving a dinner tomorrow , and requests that you attend . I 've  --  175  --  The Ugly Americanalready accepted for you . Ambassador Rodriguez seemed particularly eager . . . " " So , Don Phillippe wangled himself that job after all , the old buzzard . Sure I 'll go . I hope he 's brought a couple of cases of tuba , a wagonload of San Miguel , and those two good looking maids he kept in Manila . . . " " Eight o'clock , " said the protocol officer hastily . " Black tie . And be a little early . The Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister and several other Sarkhanese dignitaries will be there . " " You have a guest list ? " " I 'll get you one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Phillippe had already established his reputation as a good and charming host . It was rumored that he paid his chef thirty thousand pesos a year , and that he had stolen him from the Waldorf . Regardless of how much he was paid , or where he had been stolen from , the chef had made Don Phillippe 's table famous throughout the Orient. , , , After about an hour of cocktails and hors d'oeuvres , a servantcame up and whispered something to Don Phillippe . A cloud of disappointment shadowed his face , and his forehead furrowed . Don Phillippe thought a moment , then went over to Colonel Hillandale and beckoned him to one side . " Kid , " he said , " a terrible catastrophe . The first course for this evening is sole escabeche . I had the fish caught this afternoonfrom my own boat . But Henri just told me he does n't have any ginger , and it 'll take a half-hour to get it . So I 've got to stall . Do you remember the palm-reading stunt you pulled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  176  --  Six-Foot SwamiThe melody of The Whistling Pig began to drift through The Ragtime Kid 's mind . " Why , Don Phillippe , " he said , " I 'd love to . I 'm in a great palm-reading mood tonight . The humidity is just right and it so happens that Venus is in conjunction with the moon . . . " " Come on then , " said Don Phillippe , looking five years younger . " I do n't care what lies you tell these people , just amuse them for a half hour . " " Lies ? Don Phillippe , you 've hurt my feelings . " The Philippines Ambassador tapped on a glass with a spoon and when he had everyone 's attention , introduced Colonel Hillandale . " Ladies and gentlemen . We have with us this evening a most distinguished palmist and astrologer . " He paused . During the pause the Americans present laughed and a few , including George Swift , the charge d'affaires , said " Fake ! Fraud ! " The Sarkhanese leaned forward with interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Americans ' comments . Don Phillippe continued . " This distinguished man is my old friend and associate Colonel Edwin Hillandale of the U. S. Air Force . He is the only living Caucasian who is a graduate of the Chungking School of Occult Science . I have seen him perform many times , and the things I have heard him say have been both fantastic and miraculous . I remember the day he read the palm and cast the horoscope of our Secretary of Defense , Ramon Magsaysay . The Ragtime Kid  --  as we affectionatelycall the colonel  --  told Ramon that the sixteenth of the month would be his lucky day , but only if he were in the vicinity of Barang . Out of curiosity Ramon went to  --  177The Ugly AmericanBarang , a small town in Ilocos None Province . And on that day and in that town Ramon surrounded and captured the leaders of the terrible Huks , in an action which broke the back of the whole Huk movement . " The Sarkhanese Prime Minister and his foreign minister nodded at each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked the Kid if he would read some of your palms after dinner , but he told me that astrological conditions are perfect right now when Venus is in conjunction with the moon . The next half-hour is the best time to read palms , and my chef says he can hold dinner up for that length of time , so .. . I give you Colonel Hillandale . " " Bravo ! Bravo ! " said the Prime Minister , clapping his hands . Swift turned to his wife and whispered , " I wonder why MacWhite shanghaied this amateur performer . Can you imagine , vaudeville tricks at a state dinner ! " Colonel Hillandale stood up , raised his hand . " Now , ladies and gentlemen , frankly , I do n't like to do this in public . When I read palms I must tell exactly what I see . Sometimes the information is the kind you do n't want others to know . I must tell you this ahead of time . " " Start on me , Colonel , " said Swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got nothing to hide . Come on , I dare you . " They sat down under a light . The colonel spread Swift 's hand flat on his knee . Everyone crowded around . The colonel said , " When were you born ? " " You tell me , Mister Prophet . " The colonel peered closely at Swift 's hand and then said gently and without reproach , " I know that you were born on  --  178  --  Six-Foot Swamithe 28th of April , 1913 , in Santa Clara , California . I was hopingto get the exact hour and minute , since it would have helped me . But never mind . " The charge d'affaires did n't say anything . " You came from a poor family . Your father ran a saloon ; I 'm not sure , but there are indications that he went bankrupt and deserted your mother . " Mrs. Swift sucked in her breath . The colonel continued , " You wanted to be a doctor , but you could n't pass the entrance exams for medical school . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonel raised his head and looked at Mrs. Swift , saw the anguish in her face , and skipped to the next subject . " You got a job as the office manager for a real estate company , and held it until 1944 when a client of yours got a big job in Washington . 1 Ie took you along as his office manager and you did lots of little liaison jobs with Congress . Then you went to the State Departmentin the same capacity . This is your first assignment overseas . I can see in your hand that you do n't read much  --  not many books , magazines , or newspapers , I mean  --  but you have a capacity for scanning reports and for putting them in proper order . This is your great talent . You hate being scolded and when you are  --  according to your hand  --  you take it out on your wife . I could easily tell you what will happenin your future , but as long as you do n't want to tell me the exact time of your birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out when he was born , but Colonel Hillandale had already let go his hand and moved on to the next person . The Prime Minister said , " I would like to have my palm read . But I would prefer it to be in private . "  --  179  --
