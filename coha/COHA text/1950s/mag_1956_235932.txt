The view from the apartment buildings that rim Chicago 's lakefront is a pleasant , peaceful thing : the streams of cars on Lake Shore Drive , the narrow strips of green park , the rock-ribbed beaches , the glistening lake with its splashing bathers , and , in the distance , a crisp sail . From his 15th floor apartment , A. Kirk Besley , 53 , superintendent of Chicago 's Norwegian American hospital , often passed the time at his picture window studying the scene through his binoculars . <P> One sunny afternoon last week Besley sat down at his favorite window , focused his glasses on the lake . He watched a launch cut through the water , the frolicking bathers on the beach . Shifting his gaze inland he saw a woman sitting on a camp chair . She was reading a book . Walking slowly up from behind her , a white shirt in his hand , was a tanned , muscular , bare-chested man . Curious , Besley watched as the man walked along the edge of a thicket , suddenly dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Besley put down his glasses for a moment , then picked them up again . To his surprise he saw the man crawl out of the bushes , stand up , look around furtively , duck back . Then the woman left her chair , walked to a rock about three feet from the thicket . There she sat down again . <P> Then Besley watched with growing horror as the man abruptly reappeared , darted for the woman , looped his shirt around her face , pulled her down into the bushes , began beating her on the head . <P> Besley threw down his glasses , called his wife . Together , they raced for their car in the basement garage , sped across the drive , hailed a motorcycle cop . When they arrived at the thicket ten minutes later , the man was gone . In the bushes , the cop found the body of Margaret Gallagher , a 50-year-old beauty-parlor operator . Her skull was crushed , her body half-stripped . Nearby lay her book , Ben-Hur . In it was a religious picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other was printed " A Prayer for a Happy Death . "
