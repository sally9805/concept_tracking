Herding their cattle over the grassy uplands rolling down from Kilimanjaro in what is now Kenya and Tanganyika , the Masai were fierce , sensual warriors who used dung and ochre for hair oil and drank cattle blood laced with urine . In periodic sport they swooped down on their Bantu neighbors , ramming seven-foot spears through the males and carrying off their women , who often did not seem to mind ; the tall , aristocratic Masai were notable men , and Masai wives did not work . <P> The coming of the white man brought syphilis and smallpox to the Masai , rinderpest to plague their herds , and ultimately the division of the Masai into two tribes , one of 60,000 in Kenya , the other of 46,000 in Tanganyika . The Kenya Masai , both better protected by the colonial government and better behaved , found a chance to enjoy their former glories during the Mau Mau troubles , when the British put them to work tracking and killing Kikuyu terrorists . But in Tanganyika the Masai , disorganized and disfranchised , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands . Last week , as a long step toward doing something about it , the Masai installed Edward Boniface Mbarnoti as the first chief in history with federal powers over all tribesmen in Tanganyika . <P> The Choice . A more able-or less likely - spokesman for their interests the primitive , unruly Masai could hardly have found . Chosen from 200 candidates in a three-month search by the tribe 's council of elders , Mbarnoti is a big ( 6 ft. , 180 Ibs. ) , 28-year-old schoolteacher who speaks excellent English and whose only ambition-until the elders tapped him last September-was to go to England to study . The son of a slave freed by French Roman Catholic missionaries , Edward herded cattle until he was nine , then , as his father 's " love son " ( or favorite ) , was sent to school . Converted to Catholicism , he ignored most of the various age rituals of the Masai ( e.g. , Masai aged 17-27 take turns sleeping in the communal hut with the tribe 's unmarried women ) , frankly admitted : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because someone had to . " <P> The Lecture . Under the cool slopes of Monduli Mountain last week Edward Mbarnoti , dressed in a ceremonial blue robe and a monkey-hair headdress , officially received the chieftainship from Tanganyika Governor Sir Richard Turnbull , and resplendent British uniforms mingled with the Dogpatch garb of spear-carrying Masai elders and tribesmen . Edward 's coronation speech was a simple statement of Masai needs : legal recourse against farmers squatting on Masai lands , improved water facilities , a share in the profits of the tourist-frequented game reserves given up by the Masai . <P> In a remarkably ill-tempered reply Sir Richard in effect told the Masai to be satisfied with the white man 's edicts , and to accept 40 ( $112 ) as their cut of the tourist trade . Shocked , most of the assembled Masai withdrew out of hearing until he had finished his harangue , while an amazed British reporter said under his breath : " I thought this sort of thing was finished 25 years ago . " <P> The new chief took the Governor 's lecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is only the beginning . "
