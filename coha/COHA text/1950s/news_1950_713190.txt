txt Twenty-eight Senators asked President Truman today to open , by a great expansion of , United States propaganda facilities , " a psychological and spiritual offensive against the Kremlin . " The purpose , they said , should be " to bring the Russian and American peoples into contact and into relations of brotherhood . " " Let us tell the Russian people , " they added , " that we want to live in peace with them and hope that their rulers will not compel us to fight them . We would like to help them to get a better life from their rich soil , forests and mines . " These suggestions for an appeal directly to the Russian rank and file , through all forms of propaganda , to " soften and erode the foundations of the Politburo , " were made in a letter to the President signed by twelve Democrats and sixteen Republicans . Three of the signers , Senators Ralph E. Flanders , Republican of Vermont ; A. Willis Robertson , Democrat of Virginia , and H. AlexContinued ander Smith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President at the White House . Mr. Flanders told reporters later that there had been " a lively debate . " The President , he said in effect , had told his Senatorial callers that he was and long had been for stepping up this country 's propaganda output , and that Congress , which must provide the money . was not without fault that this had not been done sooner . Mr. Truman , Senator Flanders agreed , had some right on his side , but the more important thing , he said , was that the President was wholly in sympathy with what the Senators wanted now to do . Senator Robertson said that it was all very well to speak of the lack of Congressional appropriations , but there was " another side " to what he considered the ineffectiveness of the American radio voice abroad . " Anyone who has heard some of the programs we broadcast , " he added with a smile , " will understand that they could convince a listener of only one thing : that he ought to turn off his radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his twenty-seven associates said in their letter that the American people , already engaged in Korea , were in fear of " other outbreaks at other and unexpected points at a similar or greater cost to us of precious life and treasure . " " New Imagination " Urged " Let us explain to the Russians , " the letter went on , " the grim necessity of the Western world for I arming ourselves when we have seen their rulers sweep over nation after nation , destroying their freedom and enslaving their people . While the rulers of Russia have been doing this , the capitalist nations have been freeing their colonies for self-government . " We are now saying this in an indirect and partial way through the Voice of America . We need more funds and a great expansion of facilities . But more than money we need a new vigor , a new imagination , a new directness and plainness of speech . " We need the message to be continuously , indefinitely , reiterated . We need to use new means and old , thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. President , let us declare total mobilization and total engagement of our psychological and spiritual forces . " Thus we may soften and erode the foundations of the Politburo , escape the appalling expenditure of life and treasure with which we are faced and thus escape the totalitarian control of our lives which neither you , we , nor the American people can contemplate without dismay . " The other Democratic signers of the letter were Senators , John C. Stennis of Mississippi , Virgil Chapman of Kentucky , Paul H. Douglas of Illinois , J. William Fulbright of Arkansas , Carl Hayden of Arizona , Spessard L. Holland of Florida , Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota , Robert S. Kerr of Oklahoma , Herbert H. Lehman of New York , Burnet R.

Bricker of Ohio , Styles Bridges of New Hampshire , Hugh Butler of Nebraska , Homer E. Capehart of Indiana , Milton R. Young of North Dakota , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Jersey , Irving M. Ives of New York , Karl E. Mundt of South Dakota , Leverett Saltonstall of Massachusetts , Edward J. Thye of Minnesota , Kenneth S. Wherry of Nebraska and Alexander Wiley of Wisconsin . Senator Flanders devoted only one day to the quest for signatures . He said that had he worked longer he could have got many more signers . Lucas Issues Warning During the day , Senator Scott W. Lucas of Illinois , the Senate Democratic leader , said in a speech recorded for broadcast in his home state that if any attack came on an Atlantic pact country , there  --  would be no hesitation about the use of the American atomic bomb , In such an event , he said , the United States " will start tossing atomic bombs where it hurts . " He recalled that the treaty , which binds this country and Western Europe in a defensive alliance , made it plain that an attack on any one of the partners was to be treated as an attack on them all .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
