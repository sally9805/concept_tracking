 | the San Antonio  --  Chihuahua Trail , right after the war . A Confederate veteran named James Brady was employed in Follett 's wagon train . " I walked into it . " Follett , witnesses testified , shot Brady in a quarrel on the Mexican side of the river , and crossed to Presidio . That night they found Follett by the side of the road with the back of his head blown off . No indictment was ever drawn for the murder of D. M. Follett . There was not sufficient evidence . Testimony stated that James Brady had no friends beyond a young son who traveled with him in the wagons . The boy disappeared . " Rucker smiled again . " A long time ago ? " Now listen to me , Brady . I want to ask you a question . I have told you what I know so that you could answer my question in fairness to me and fairness to yourself . Would you like to enlist in the Texas Rangers ? " " What ? " " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not meddle uselessly in old forgotten business . I see no good in it . I prefer the business of the day . I asked you about joining my company . I do n't ask a scoundrel to scout with me . " Martin felt his heart pounding as he searched again into Rucker 's unmoving pale eyes . In the silence a deep and sudden emotion of belief surged up to confront Martin Brady with the image of a man finding camp at last , lost no longer . " A friendless boy , " Rucker said with half a smile hidden in his black beard , " that could raise his spunk the way I think you raised yours , and make his way in a strange country with a strange tongue , has some makings ? " I 'll tell you why I want you . I expect I will be crossing the river before long ; the only way to get Fuego is to have my rangers free to operate on both sides . Judge Heffridge has been in Austin seeing the governor for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet from the Mexicans , from some felon called Salcido who appears to have burned and raped his way to the governorship of Chihuahua . We will get our permission . A few more Indian outrages will do it . When I cross the river I need a ranger ? and I do n't have him ? with complete command of the  | Spanish language and with intimate knowledge of those people 1 down there . " A private in the rangers gets forty dollars a month , and rations . The state furnishes ammunition , but you provide your own mount , rig , arms , clothes and blankets . If it does n't appeal to you , say so . " " I ? I never heard of nothing in the world I would like more . " " What about that leg , Brady ? I understand you broke it . " " I did , but it got well . It is in good shape . " " You limp . Another thing ? they tell me you brought a freight ( art to Puerto . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Don Cipriano Castro . I was going to quit . I made up my mind . I was going to stay on this side . " " I tell you what you do , Brady . You think this matter over . You get your leg all well . You square yourself with the Mexican you were working for . You watch yourself . When I get back from scout , I 'll enlist you . " " I will do how you tell me ? Captain . " Rucker smiled , opening the door . " ? Meet some of the boys out here . Well ! " Rucker said , " I guess they 've all gone to their mess . " The big adobe square was empty . Martin saw a lady with a white apron step out from a door on the other side of the patio . She waved her hand . " Supper , John ! " she called . Rucker made a salute to her ; Martin took off his hat . " Brady , " Rucker said , " come over here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? Mrs. Rucker , this is Mr. Brady from down in Chihuahua . I may make a ranger of him . " She smiled at Martin . " Good evening , Mr. Brady . Would you have supper with us ? " " Why , I ? yes , mam , I ? " " Then you just come right in . Judge Heffridge is with us , John . My , was n't that awful , those Indians ! " " We 'll be along in a minute , Kate . I will show you where to wash , Brady . " Clean and combed , Martin walked through the door into the Rucker parlor . He emulated the captain carefully , hanging his hat ,  | then his gun belt , on the deerhorn rack by the door , and he turned toward the room with a kind of straight-faced , awkward excitement . Martin Brady had not been in a room like it for more than half his life . " Louisa , this is Mr. Brady , " Martin heard the captain saying . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How do you do , Mr. Brady . " Martin felt his face burn . He nodded his head , not knowing what to do with his hands grown suddenly huge and hanging useless out of his sleeves . " Gentlemen , good evening , " Judge Heffridge wheezed , from a rocking chair . His right arm had not been brought through the sleeve of his black coat and he held out his left hand to Martin . " How is the arm , Judge ? " Captain Rucker asked . " Stovall dressed it . I fear , Captain , that I am not seriously enough wounded to require many further ministrations from your good ladies . I deeply regret it ! " Mrs. Rucker came through the door . Her white apron was gone . " Supper is on , " she said . " Judge , are you real sure you can be comfortable at the table ? " " Certain of it , Mrs. Rucker ? if you and Miss Louisa can overlook my awkwardness ! " " Why , we 're so grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She turned to her husband . " John ? Barney is n't home yet . His supper will be cold . I do n't know what I am going to do about that boy . " " I do , " Captain Rucker said . " Shall we go to table ? " In the lamplit dining room Martin was embarrassed that he had not helped Mrs. Rucker be seated . He had not known that he should until it was too late . The judge had done it , with one hand . The captain had helped Louisa . Martin sat straight and tense by Barney 's empty place , acutely uncomfortable with desire to deport himself well . Mixed with the desire was a confusing , acute happiness . The lamplight seemed golden . It seemed the very color of the sound of Miss Louisa 's voice . His mind did not work with the meanings of the words of the conversation flowing around him . He heard them  | only as sounds . He covertly watched the captain 's hands , to see how he buttered the cornbread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravied meat . The captain used a spoon with the beans ; Nlartin imitated the example . He was sure the food was the best he had ever eaten , yet it seemed to have no actual taste . It demanded work in swallowing . He was startled feeling suddenly the eyes around the table turned to him , expecting him to speak . " Have you enjoyed living down there , Mr. Brady ? " It took him a moment to come to the meaning of the words . " Father says you have lived there so long . " " It is mighty nice , up here on this side , mam . " " What was your work in Mexico ? " " I worked cattle . I was a hand . On a big place called Valdepenas . The last few years , I was riding the silver trains from the mountains , from El Tigre Mine , to the mint , at Chihuahua . " " What a rich country ! " the judge said . " Governed by blackguards . " " I suppose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know any of their songs ? Their songs are beautiful . " Martin swallowed . " They are , " he said . " I ca n't sing very well . I wish I could . " " Miss Louisa is an accomplished musician , " the judge said . " How you grace the pianoforte , my dear ! " " Judge ! " Louisa said . " But I do wish I might learn some of the Spanish songs ? " " Daughter , might I have a little more coffee ? " Rucker said . " Then I am going to be rude to you all . I am going to ask the judge if I may have a conversation with him about affairs in Austin . I am sure you are tired , Judge , yet this is my only opportunity . I am pressed for time , with a number of things to tend to , leaving before daylight . " " We 'll talk by all means , Rucker , " said the judge . When they rose from the table , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stay awhile , Mr. Brady ? " Mrs. Rucker asked . " I think I better leave , " Martin said . He felt clumsy , going to the rack by the door while they watched him , buckling on his gun , taking his hat . Wishing he could stay .  | " I thank you , very much , " Martin said , standing with his hat in his hands . " Everything was the best that I ever had . " " Good land , Mr. Brady ! " Mrs. Rucker said , laughing . " We just enjoyed having you ! " Louisa came from where she stood by the piano . " Good-by , Mr. Brady . I am sorry you ca n't give any Spanish songs . " " Mam , I could give the words sometime if you want me to . Maybe you could make out the tune . " " Good-by , Brady , " Rucker said , standing at the door . He shook Martin 's hand . Martin Brady stepped out alone into the dark patio . Voices came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned and went out the archway into the quiet street . Some of the lamplight from the parlor showed golden through the shutter . It seemed a gold lustrous as the little rounded golden pin that clasped at Louisa Rucker 's collar , a warm gold like the lights on her hair , the color of the golden flecks shining alive in her hazel eyes . He looked up into the sky , into the warm and quiet dark where the stars burned golden too , like many lamps . The branches of a cottonwood arched up above him in a kind of dance against the golden stars . He walked away from where the walls lined the streets of Puerto , along a path by open spaces on a back way through the town . He wanted to walk not limping , on two good legs , feeling the plant of his steps and the print of his feet on the land where Martin Brady lived now , where Martin Brady belonged . From somewhere in the dark streets westward , he heard the muffled pop of a pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his steps along the sandy path , he heard two more shots from the same-sounding gun , a blurred shout , and quietness again . He walked almost smiling in the starlight . It is somebody celebrating , he thought . I am celebrating . Oh , I am celebrating . It does not come from any bottle nor a gun like that . It comes from people who were good to me . It comes from everything , everything better than I ever thought . Old Sterner will have a fit , the day I tell him , the day I have joined . They will have nothing to say to Private Martin Brady , the Texas Rangers . I am through with all the old times now .  | When he came around the corner , nearly home , he saw a lighted lantern moving across the street ahead . It jerked in the dark , a small and yellow ball of light . It disappeared , behind black moving shapes , and bobbed abruptly , reappearing bright . The black shapes were men walking . The lantern went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the feeble line of light from the open door , toward the dark figures . He came up to them , ready with his right hand , ready to move . " What is it ? " he asked . He could not see . " Que paso ? " " That you , Brady ? " " What is it , Ruelle ? " " Some son of a bitch pistol-whipped young Sterner . " Martin shoved into the door , into the light . Gregorio stood with the lantern in his hand . He pointed toward the doorway that led to Sterner 's living quarters . It was open and there was light . Ludwig Sterner lay on his back , on the bed . His uncle knelt with a towel , trying to wipe the blood . Martin saw the gash on the head where the red oozed through the wet hair . Blood welled from the cut in the swollen cheek , from the laid-open lip , puffed and pulling crooked on the battered face . The cook Concha came with a pan of water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isaac Sterner . " Women know how , " she said . Isaac Sterner looked up , noticing Martin . Isaac Sterner was crying . " Who did it ? " Martin said . " I do n't know . The boy Ludwig , hurting nobody , walking in the street . Just walking . " " Vartin ? " The name came queer from the bloody , crooked mouth . " Vardin Radhy ? " " Digame , Chico ! " Martin bent down . He put his hand on Ludwig 's shoulder . It seemed very small . " Tell me who done it , Chico . Can you tell me ? " The puffed lip moved , but no sound came . " We will see about him , Chico , " Martin said . He walked along the dark way through the store , hearing the sound of his own words , We will see about him , Chico.  | He went by Gregorio 's lantern , out the door , into the street . Ruelle was still there . " I want to know who done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Barton , somebody said , Happy Barron , Handy Barton , something . Tall . Just come to town . Riding a dun horse , if that 's him ? " They got him ? " " Hell no they did n't ! " " Why did n't they ? " " Nobody tried . " " Anybody know where he went ? " " Somebody said down there towards the tent saloon ? " " Where 's the law at ? " " The law ? The law named McFeeters is at Hogan 's drunk as a skunk . I told you there would be hell popping tanbark when sons of bitches started filling this town ! I 'm about to pack a derringer myself . They shot at the little Jew 's feet making him dance and calling him a shitass sheeny ? Look here , Brady , you be careful ? " Martin moved away into the dark . He moved fast . The street was very dark . He heard the footsteps following him , and he jerked around . " Hijos de putas ! Cobardes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last wall , through the salt cedars , he saw the glow of the lights shining through the tent top . He smelled the river in the darkness beyond . In the dim light by the tent door , he heard the music inside . He saw the horses at the rack , a dun horse . He untied it and cut hard at the face with a rein . The horse plunged loose , out into the dark ; Martin stood still a moment by the door flap , adjusting his eyes to the light . He stepped in casually , calling out above the music , " Whose dun horse out there ? " A dark whiskered man turned from the bar . " What about the dun horse ? " " Broke loose , kicking ! " Martin said . " Thought I 'd tell whoever it belonged to . " " Why , goddamn the goddamn goddamned hell , go catch him ! " The crowd had turned to look .  | " Do n't like to touch another man 's horse , " Martin said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " If the goddamned horse was loose ? " He saw Martin was armed . " Could n't you bring him up ? " " I got a bad leg here , but I will help you head him ? " Beyond the canvas flap outside , the man looked at the rack . He moved out into the dark . " Ho ? whoa ! You boogered goddamn bastard , I 'll blow your goddamn ? Christ ! " he said , turning . " You catch him . Buy you a goddamn drink . " Martin moved carefully . Not shoot him , not kill him . Catch him . Hurt him , not shoot . Take him to Rucker . " Say ! " Martin whispered . " I saw you work over that kid , up the street ! " " What about it ? Was n't that a goddamn caution ? I made the goddamn yellowbelly Jew boy ? " Martin swung with his doubled left fist , hitting with all his weight . The punch struck solid in the face ? too high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark topple back half twisting , hitting the ground with a grunt , with a hand scrabbling , and Martin knew it was not enough . He sprang to kick the face and grab . The face jerked away as he sprang and he saw the split-second glint in the hand coming up . Martin fired , feeling the recoil jump solid in his hand , with the cracking flash down into the shape on the ground and the burning smell , and the shape moved . Martin fired again . He fired again , and the shape did not move , and he ran around the corner of the tent as they came out the door . Bent low into the darkness of the thicket , he moved carefully , furious with the tornillo thorns that snagged scratching across him as he worked down the slope , through the musty brush to the open place of the river . He came to the soft bank unbuckling his gun belt , seeing starlight shining in the black water at his feet , hearing a shout from somewhere in the thicket at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his left hand the gun belt high and dry , he eased down unsplashing into the quiet current , feeling the breath jerk in his throat with the shock of the water 's cold . He moved out into it paddling underwater with his feet and his right hand , slowly , with the drift downstream , working , with  | the breath coming hard , out across the space of the murmuring rippled darkness toward the line of the black bank on the other side . He thrashed up to it in a shallow matted with a tangle of high cattail , and climbed out through the stinking ooze , splashing , grasping at the sharp-edged , rustling reeds , holding his gun , holding his gun high and dry in his stiffening left hand , reaching dry ground with water slopping from his jeans and his boots squishing as he hobbled with his leg hurting up the claybank away from the water . He turned for a moment and looked back . In the sticking sharp wetness of the clothes that bound him , he trembled with the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | CHAPTER XIII MARTIN climbed from the gully , hearing the sound of his breath in the silence . He came up at the back of the tall wall and moved around it to the corner , to the street . It was empty . His damp boot soles made a faint scratch as he stepped along the dim arches of the portico in the starlight . When he raised his knuckles to the shadowed face of the Chihuahua stage station door , his hand stopped . I got to have Lagrimas , he told himself .  | Looking over his shoulder , Martin rapped on the door . Pancho Gil , you got to bring me my horse . Martin rapped and waited . He rapped louder , hating the sound , and waited . No answer came to him and he shifted his feet , pulling his gun . He tapped on the wood with the pistol butt . " Don Pancho ! Oye ! Don Pancho " Martin put his ear to the door . He stood listening for a long time . The stillness , the blackness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun butt , banging on the door . " Don Pancho ! Tu amigo ! Bredi ! " From the silence a town dog howled baying ; the vacant face of the lightless door stood unmoving , soundless . Pancho Gil made no light in the stage station , made no answer . Slipping the gun into the holster , Martin limped away from the door . His shirt clung damp to the small of his back , and he shivered clenching his jaws , moving slowly along the tall wall . At the high and heavy double gate of the corral he stopped and raised his eyes at its dark solidity . He kicked at it with the side of his boot , and turned to lean against the wood . He ached with weariness . His leg hurt . He felt the swollen left wrist , flexing it . If I 'd just hit him hard enough , he said to himself alone in the dark . He rubbed at the skinned knuckles , But I did n't . " And I shot the son of a bitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I had to . " " Who is it ? " a voice whispered from the other side of the gate timbers . Hackles stood on Martin 's neck as he jerked around . " Don Pancho ? " " Shhh ! Who speaks ? " " Bredi . From Valdepeiias ? open it ! " He heard the bolt slide and saw the gate open a crack . The dark tube of a musket barrel came pointing out . " All right . You are Bredi . Pass in . " He stepped through the gate . When it closed again , and the iron bolt was thrown , the figure with the musket turned . The voice whispered , " I heard the words of English . Otherwise ? "  | " I want Don Pancho. " " know you from the day you came with the cart . With the black horse . " " Wake Don Pancho . " " You think he would not wake with your noise ? He 's gone ! When they came to take him , he was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you making jokes ? " " Answer me ? when who came to take him ? " " Salcidistas ! Who else ? As soon as they had the garrison and the city hall , they came to take him ! " " Mother of Jesus , they got this town ! When ? " " Now . This evening . The captain of the garrison gave them the key ! They drank all the wine in the customs , then rutted . Did n't you hear bells ? " " came around the town , from the other side . I did n't know it . " Martin brought one of the two silver pesos from his wet pocket and put the coin in the dark hand . " Take me to Don Pancho . " " How ? He is gone ? " " Listen to me ! Listen well . I am man of confidence of Cipriano Castro , the patron . You take me to Pancho Gil . " " He 's far , senor . " " You take me . You understand you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no mule ? the Salcidistas took ? " " Shit of that . We go afoot . We go any way . " " Senor . I speak truth . I am afraid . I am also guard of this property , for Don Pancho . I can not go . You are not of the Salcidistas , so 1 can tell you something . " He made a cross of thumb and forelinger . He kissed it . " The truth , " he whispered . " On the main road to Zaragosa , a league more or less , is the farm of the Asunsolos . You will find it by asking . Don Pancho hides at the Asunsolos ' , by the river . In secret . He awaits developments . " " And if you have not told me ? If he is not at the ? the Asunsolos ' ? " " I have told you . By this Cross . " " Open the gate . " " That you go with God . " He went quietly in the quietness , skirting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stopping still , waiting in the dark when dogs barked . He labored along the dim broken spaces of fields and thickets of brush near the river , hoping he walked the Zaragosa road , moving in a kind of fever southward toward the dark line where the valley met the sky . He limped as he moved tensing the soreness of his leg , dragging the heel scuffing as he swung the weak foot ahead . Sweat ran from under the band of his hat . The bunchy dampness of his clothes dried hot . He smelled the breath from the staleness of his mouth , and he swallowed often , turning his eyes , expecting the morning star over the trees beyond the river . His mind moved circling , cutting arcs , hovering the effort of his flesh . Night silence suddenly coiled with the whirl of his thought , spinning , crying out with the black earth tilted away , withdrawn from his step . It came back reeling from space , banging dizzy on the sole of his boot . Martin Brady sat down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky twist over , and with the palm of his hand on the grainy ground he closed his eyes . A padded flutter and shuffle soft in the sand sent sound from dream to shaken wakefulness . In the gray light , gray burro legs moved too near his face . Packsaddles cinched with knotted mecate joggled squeaking ; a rock hit and bounced from the ragged rump of the last donkey in the file . " Arre ! " said a voice . Martin sat up by the side of the road and saw the wood hauler trailing the beasts . " Que bubo , " Martin said . He coughed , dry in the throat . The wood hauler stopped in his tracks . " Ah , " he said , after a while . " Juice . That 's it . Juice of the vine . Juice of the mescal . " " Neither , " Martin said , standing up . The wood hauler 's lips were open in an expressionless grin , as if wires pulled at the corners of his mouth . He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sleeping out . I believed it was the juice . " " Is this the road to Zaragosa ? " " It is the road . " " Do you know the farm of the Asunsolos ? " The wood hauler looked at Martin , surveyed the tree , the acequia , the field beyond . " Asunsolos , " he said . " Asunsolos. "  | " Where is the farm of the Asunsolos ? " " You ask where ? Excuse me , senor ? " " 1 ) o you know where is the farm of the Asunsolos ? " " An oddity . Asking for Asunsolos . " " What oddity ? " The wood hauler moved his hand upward as if he used its edge slice the air carefully , over the acequia . He sighted along his in at the field beyond . " The farm of the Asunsolos. " " lluh ! " The wood hauler looked sideward at the gringo with the gun . " 11 ' i th your permission ? " As Martin walked along the edge of the vineyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A congregation of jangly blackbirds flew from a dead cottonwood . By the corral , a dog Came snarling . Martin picked up a broken wagon spoke from the clutter by a tumbled adobe wall , and stood waiting , while the dog barked . A man came from around the corner of the house under the ecs . He was armed and wore spurs . He walked forward with his es fastened on Martin , kicked at the sidling dog , and spoke . " Who do you look for ? " " Scnor Asunsolo . " " At your orders . " " Martin Bredi , at yours . " " What do you want ? " " I am from Valdepenas , Hacienda de Valdepenas . " " You appear to be from Texas . Without horse . " " I have been there . I crossed the river last night , late . I went to the station of the Chihuahua stage . I went looking for a friend of Mine . " " Well ? Who told you to come here ? " " The peon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't . " " I understand that , senor . In that case ? could I drink from your well and rest myself ? before I go ? " " In that case suit yourself . " When Martin had both hands on the well rope , the man with the gun and spurs moved briskly around the house , and disappeared .  | I did it wrong , I 'm tired , Martin thought , tipping the dented bucket to his lips . Senor Pancho Gil . But if he 's here , they 'll tell him . And if they tell him , he 'll see me . If he 's not here ? He set the bucket down , and moved around the tumbled wall . Seated in the long shade , with his back to the adobe , he took off his hat , and rubbed his eyes . He felt his belly gnaw for food . A line of ants marched by his boots , out over the wagon ruts in the sunlight . A beetle went by . Hearing footsteps , Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the corner of the wall . " Andale Bredi ! A loyal man . We need you ! The goddamned Salcidistas ? " The eyes in the heavy brown jowled face surveyed Martin as he rose to his feet . " Swimming rivers ? No horse ? " " I came to ask your help . I left my horse on the other side . " " What ? " " I had trouble . We have to get the horse . It 's at Sterner 's . " " What trouble ? " Martin tapped the gun . " I left . " Gil clicked his tongue . " Shooting ? With gringos , eh ? Ha ! " " A gringo . He abused the nephew of Sterner . Maybe I killed him . I came over here ? " " Good ! Now you can kill some Mexicans .

" He sat outside the door of the smoky kitchen , breaking off limp pieces of tortilla , with them scooping the beans and chili , the shreds of strong meat , from the clay bowl to his hungry mouth .  | deleted page  | Martin 's thought traveled out the invisible space beyond the black line of the hills westward to the Sierra Madre , the mother mountains of Mexico .

The soft shuffle came , the click of a hoof , a snort , and a squeak of wet leathers , before he could see . There were three horses . " Thou , Bredi ? " a hoarse voice said . " Here !

"  | CHAPTER XIV HE MEASURE of difference , the height of spirit , between a foot on earth and a foot in stirrup , was manifest in the centaur line of his back , in the easy , faintly swinging frame of his shoulders . He rode alone , his eyes sharp , among dry scourings strewn like gigantic bones of stone and ancient crumbling grit from the bare , ruined carcass of the world .

The worn walls of the hacienda at Carmen waited for him somewhere at the foot of the blue , and he frowned , squinting into the south . It is the wrong sierra , Martin Brady told himself , the wrong blue , coming closer . He heard the words far back in the silent shade of his skull . I did stop , at the edge of the dunes , that second morning .

How are you ? " You did this to me . When Pancho Gil got you across that river , ncho Gil got me . Now the Castros get us both . lie slowed along the gravelly rise of the wash upstream , crossing the trace of the stage road , watching for sign , for moccasin tracks . Through stunted thickets of gray granjeno and wilted clumps of sacahuiste he came to the glittering bed of the waterless stream , and crossed over , turning south , away from the ruts of the road , to high ground where he could see over the breaks into the empty furnace of the plain with the dry gash of the watercourse sloping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment and looked at what lay behind him . San Isidro , the crossing of the saint of farmers , he thought . San Isidro , he would find it a little dry . The old man at Potrero said water was upstream and we will wet our nose , Horse , when we find it . I hope it is better water than the scum at Alamo de Pena , or that water at dawn when I saddled you in the dark and rode down to Potrero with the old man telling us the road by the ditch and the people sneaking behind the walls afraid . Two days past , the old man said , the Apaches of Fuego rode into the plazita laughing and got off with rifles cocked . They were insolent , as if  | the people of Potrero were beneath reason . That is what the old man said . The Apaches walked into the houses . They jerked blankets from the people 's shoulders , from the beds of the sick . They took all the blankets . They took three girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would come back to Potrero and they rode away carrying the girls and the blankets . The people did nothing . They awaited the return of Fuego . They awaited a new cruelty . These were bad times with war in the south and Apaches in the north , the old man said . He said the citizens were sheep . Not all the citizens , Martin rode thinking . There were some wolves around . Enough coyotes . Maybe a few sheep dogs that starved or got belted to death for their trouble , while the sheep bleated . And that is enough about animals , he thought , but this is a sad and sorry country . Something holds it . It has got too much patience . It do n't expect enough . In my country ? say ! ? there is too much expecting and not enough patience . Your country . You had your chance . You had supper once with Miss Louisa Rucker . You walked out of her house and shot a man . And ran . She thinks a lot of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear all those songs . Her father and her mother would be so glad to have you teach her the words . Ai chinita que vente connzigo Adonde vivo yo . It means in Spanish , Miss Louisa , that it 's a love song , about a dove . It says , that you come with me , to where I live . Come with me to where I scratch fleas at El Carmen and sleep by the horse corral . The clack of a hoof on a glancing stone was the only break in the beat of the soft sound treading the silence , the long space , the long hours . The muscled black shoulders moved in their smooth alternate thrusts with the sway and push from the lift and swing of the steady black driving haunches . The sun moved . Shade grew edging into the flat glare , adding a depth slowly , building a form and a solidity into the outreaching fall of distance . Shadow reached across the hoofprints of a horse . Shine cut under the brim of a hat . The Sierra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It stood with its detail revealed , on the visible feet of its upthrust slope from the plain , frowning from its blue-shaded crags , its jagged turrets and smashed cupolas of high stone . Below , the wash of Rio del Carmen made a pale twisting scar . It was laced with a rim of green as it turned from the plain into the roughening hills and went from sight beyond a shouldering bluff . Lagrimas , smell water . Remember the place ? When we came with the cart ? It took us a day from the hacienda , with the oxen . We will make it in two hours , we ? He pulled up stopping sharp , with a tall mesquite for cover at his back . Squinting into the sun with his hand projecting his hatbrim , he watched the black dots circling slow in the sky , beyond the far side of the green bend in the Carmen . He strained his eyes until they watered , looking for movement , for telltale dot or hint of dust in the brush or on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beyond , to the shoulder of the sierra . Under him his horse 's breath came timed with a faint repeating squeak of sweated leather in the unmoving silence . When the horse moved again , answering the spur , the first step of the hoof seemed cracking loud in the quiet . Two days past , the old man said this morning . Maybe it was Fuego , leaving that souvenir for the birds , Martin thought as he watched , maybe it was n't . Maybe Fuego has moved on to another water , maybe he has n't ? but I 'll south the long way around with room to run . If they jump me . He turned abruptly into the sun , riding low ground , through the long breaks to the edge of the gravel , to the big tabacon leaves in the slanting light , with the musty smell , and the bright green jarilla , and the dusty tall willow , watching . At the far side of the open wash , in untracked silt , in the shade of a flood-marked stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the hooves rattled the gravel . I 'll let you , Horse . You need it . You might need it more . Do n't waste time . This is not a good place . He sat with his eyes first running along the way he would jump the bank into the brush , if he had to . Then he turned , watching around the sides of the draw , hearing the pulling suck at the horse 's lips , the fluid gugging up the rings of the gullet , the sudden  | break of liquid plash as the horse 's head came up with the munch of teeth on dripping bit . And I might as well take my chances too , you damn horse , it sounds good . It sounds wet . He slid off . Scooping with his hatbrim cupped , he lifted it and drank , tasting mud with the stale felty smell of the wetted brim , swallowing the tepid wetness running it over his tongue and the back of his teeth and down his throat . He dipped to drink twice again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rinsed his mouth and squirted water . Wiping his chin , he stepped into the stirrup and swung around , up the bank into the brush . He came out across the ruts of the mail road into the dry open , seeing no sign , moving away from the road , working out from the circling buzzards in a wide loop westward on the flat before he turned south again . He rode in a fast rack , turning his eyes , sensitive to the pitch of the points on his horse 's black ears . That is too many birds , he thought as he looked back . And not enough sign . We have missed their sign , Horse , whoever they were . We are not going back to see . Over his right shoulder the plain swept west to its hazed horizon under thunderheads fire-edged with the lowering sun . At his left the broken scarp of the Sierra Mojina pitched up cobalt-shadowed and immense over the tangled line of brush along the Carmen 's wash . He watched the menacing tangle darken , out beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the light moved down , reddening , in the west . The sign ? more sign than he looked for ? came suddenly , and he bent over , reining , to read a churned swathe of horse tracks . The hooves that made them were all shod . They marked the ground in a regular order of files . The files moved long-strided , toward where the buzzards flew . He swung down from Lagrimas , and squatted to study the soil grains edging the tracks . When he had examined them , he remounted and rode on , puzzling along the backtrack of the many prints southward . They were n't Fuego 's . They were a troop or more of cavalry from the direction of El Carmen , early yesterday , or the day be- fore that . They hurried , and somebody left something for the birds . The sun dropped over the horizon , lifting its red stretching fire from across the ground , from across the horse tracks , leaving blue shade . The blue turned purple following the last reddened light up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepening sky . Another dry camp , Horse , no El Carmen tonight . No El Carmen for us until we know which cavalry ? The buzz and the jump came in the same instant . Lagrimas broke wind as the hooves struck and lifted high again , with Martin rebalanced . He looked back at the ugly shape coiled dim on the ground , still buzzing . " Good horse , " Martin said . There is trouble around El Carmen this evening . There is not even a man moving goats to a pen for the night . There is nothing but horse tracks and a rattlesnake and it 's getting dark . The great star of the Lyre stood over the Sierra Mojina as Martin turned toward water . He rode down through the brush , picking his way quietly to the cottonwoods . As he moved under he branches , a breeze rustled in the heart-shaped leaves dark above hum . He came to the edge of the water and smelled the damp grass . The horse drank long , without hurry , while Martin stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rustle of the cottonwoods . In the cool , he felt his face still burn from the long glare of the day . He got on his belly and drank . From the saddlebags he pulled a tin cup and a canvas bag of pinole , parched corn ground and mixed with sugar . When he had scooped up water in the cup , he poured some of the pale meal into it , and stirred it with his finger . Sitting in the grass against a tree he ate his sweetened gruel from the cup , while his horse fed strongly , pulling grass and munching , moving faintly , in the dark . The bright star stood high above the sierra when he put the reins over the black neck and swung into the saddle . LIe cut across the shallow water , up the slope at an easy walk in the starlight , through scrub oak and cardenche , into the hills . As he came over the rounded crest of a rise , he saw what he looked for in the south ? campfires at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | dark . He sat the saddle for a while watching , wondering for whom they burned . When he stepped down from the stirrup , he uncoiled from the pommel the slender line of the cabrestante and with it tied Lagrimas to the trunk of an oak ; then he unsaddled and unbridled , and hung a nose bag , with cracked corn in its bottom , on Lagrimas ' black nose . He put his saddle and rifle and the unfolded Saltillo on a clear place , and stretched out on the ground , resting his neck against the saddle seat , with his hat off , looking up at the stars , hearing the muffled sound of the horse 's teeth grinding on the grain . When the sound had ceased , he got up . The campfires at El Carmen were almost gone . He took the empty morral off the horse 's nose , and looked around , listening in the quietness , then went to his blanket , unstrapped his gun , and slept hungry .  | CHAPTER XV THE LINE of mud huts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light when Martin came to the edge of the settlement at El Carmen . In the gray quiet , El Carmen bore no visible scar of violence . Smoke from dim chimneys rose thin and straight up the windless air . A calf bawled from behind walls . Martin rode into a thicket by the lane that led to the straggled village . He sat waiting , while the light grew from behind the looming Sierra Mojina.  | He waited a long time , sitting the saddle , before the strawhatted rider on the thin pony came trotting up the lane . " Good morning , " Martin called as casually as he could , coming from the mesquite . The brown face under the straw brim showed concern . The eyes in the face looked quickly at the black horse , at the armed rider with the gringo hat , with the gringo clothes ? on a Mexican saddle . The eyes found no explanation ; the bare heels hit the thin pony in the flanks . " A moment , friend . " Martin carefully smiled . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmen ? " " There is none . " Martin rode out , alongside the thin pony . " El Carmen had Apaches ? Tell me , man ! " " Apaches , no . " " The hacienda , there on the hill , who holds the Hacienda del Carmen ? " The eyes under the straw brim looked sideward . " Do the Castros hold it ? " Martin asked . " Clearly . " " Are the Castros on the hacienda now ? " " The general . " The eyes glanced sideward again , from under the straw brim . " The general , riding a black horse . Of which I now see a copy . " Martin watched the back of the hurrying hat joggle up the lane . A high wall of thick adobe , with musket ports and corner towers , enclosed the Hacienda del Carmen on the hill . The wall was edged with early sunlight when Martin headed up the hoofchurned road to ask entrance at the gate . As he came nearer , he saw there was no gate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been was darkened with the stain of smoke . A guard with a gun stood alert in the opening . The guard wore the standard widebrimmed felt sombrero with the scarlet barboquejo , the red chin string , of Marcos Castro 's cavalry . " Who lives ? " the guard challenged . " Mexico . " Martin took the chance . " And the Castros . " " What do you want ? " " I have an express for the general . "  | " Improbable . With the Texas hat . " " Who is your captain ? El Verdugo ? " " Do you know him ? " " You tell him Bredi is here . Bredi . Riding from Del Norte . " " That is a Castro horse you ride . " " Without doubt . " " Dismount , and I will have you taken . ? Hei , Pito ! " he called . A bandy-legged little cavalryman stepped toward the guard . " Take him to the captain . " The guard turned to Martin . " He will carry your firearms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lagrimas , following the bandy legs cased in their worn leather . A long sheath knife wagged out over the scat of the breeches . The knife 's horn handle was snugged above the belt , in the small of the trooper 's back . He walked examining the Colt and Winchester he had taken from Martin . " Good arms , " the trooper said , hefting one in each hand . " Very good . We have the Remington of one shot . Without pistol ? but with knives . " Martin felt the strangeness of being in a crowd , encircled by a wall . Cook fires were burning on the tracked dust . The tang of mesquite smoke and the flaming drip of fat from beef spitted over the fires , richened the air . Martin felt his nostrils move and his belly reach for the sizzling hot meat . A few old women moved among the scores of big-hatted men . The women carried clay bowls of beans , chili , tortillas in stacks . Over the crowd stood the massive shape of the hacienda 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath their smoked lintels the windows were black holes behind blackened iron bars . " What happened , Maestro ? " Martin asked his trooper . " The Salcidistas happened . " " When ? " " Six days past . " " When did you come ? " Martin indicated the men at the fires . They were cutting broiled beef with their long knives . " Day before yesterday . " " I saw the buzzards north of here , and the horse tracks . " " And the tracks of Salcidistas ? " The trooper spit . " They made them going out . Only going out . "  | The ruined blacksmith shed stood at the battered end of outbuildings between the big house and the maze of adobe corrals . A smith worked at the anvil in the ruin , by a dented iron tub of red coals and a peon pumping at a patched , wheezing bellows . Past the corner post of the shed , horses were tied along a line awaiting the smith 's attention . As Martin came toward them , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sheaths of dusty leather . He stood with a quirt in his hand , watching a farrier measure shoes for a high-headed bay . " My captain , " Martin 's trooper said . El Verdugo turned , in the sound of the clanking anvil and the spark-blowing wheeze of the bellows . His hat sat on the back of his head , spilling a thick jet forelock in the beads of sweat on his brow . The eyes under the bony jut of the brow were as black , as impassable , as the burned , iron-barred windows of the big house . They fixed on Martin , then moved over him in a flat stare . A hint of stained teeth showed from under the twists of a sweeping mustache . " Very oddly dressed , " the captain remarked . " Still mounted on that black . " " I brought a letter . From Senor Gil in Del Norte . " " And how is Del Norte ? " " At the orders of Salcido . " " This hacienda was likewise at the orders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring , surveying the evidence . " The day before yesterday in the morning , the orders were changed . You came late for the fiestas . ? Hand me the damned letter . I 'm busy . " Martin pulled the paper from the money belt inside his shirt and handed it to the captain , who took it and turned his back , without a word , to watch the farrier nail a shoe . Martin stood waiting , eyeing the thick insolence of the unmoving back . " My horse has come fifty leagues , " Martin finally said , between his teeth . " Is it possible to issue orders for forage ? " The back turned and the eyes leveled , not at Martin but at the trooper who stood holding Martin 's guns . " Give Mister Bredi his tools and take him to the devil or the forage sergeant . " El Verdugo  | turned his back again . " Bredi ? you understand you are at the general 's orders ? move on ! " Martin swallowed , keeping his mouth shut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pistol into the holster . The trooper put the carbine in the scabbard under the stirrup , and they led Lagrimas away , along the pitted walls , to the opened gate of a corral . The trooper pointed beyond a haycart . " There is the sergeant , " he said . It was Diego Casas . " God of my life ! " Diego came with the red chin string of Marcos Castro 's cavalry biting his cheeks . " Son of the mother ! " I le embraced Martin . " On two good legs ! " They slapped dust from each other 's backs . " You are acquainted , " the trooper observed . " Not with a sergeant ! " Martin said . " Of the valiant ! " grinned Diego . " In charge of corn and hay . " " I will leave you , with your permission , " the trooper said . " Thanks , Pito , " Diego said , " for bringing him . He is my twin . " " It was a pleasure . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and feed him ? " " You came to the place , Martin ! I want you to wait here a minute . I go to arrange something . " Diego disappeared around a corner . Martin stood with the worn ramal of the reins in his hand . " I lorse , " he said in English , patting the black neck , " do you like t his ? " When Diego reappeared through a gate , the peon Pablo came with him . " Martin ! " Pablo pulled off his hat , smiling with the wrinkles creased deep in his face . His eyes glistened . He put out his brown hard hand . " The times are better , " Pablo said , " with our friend Martin ! Like old times . " " With our friend Pablo , " Martin said . " Much better ! " " Tend the stallion , " Diego said . " Old times , Martin , " Pablo said . " And the leg all well ! Hu Lagrimas ! The same . The same . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I will give him charge . We will divert ourselves with novelties from the north ! Hast thou eaten , Martin ? " " Not in twenty years . " " We have the remedy ! " He sat in the shade with Diego , chewing , tearing the savory meat from the bones with his teeth , licking the yellow fat from his fingers , drinking the fiery juice from the frijole bowl , dipping beans with eatable scoops he made of rolled tortillas , and chewing more meat . " Diego , it heals me . Fifty leagues with a bag of pinole and a little came seca . " " Ah , the belly grows , there in the north , with the rich food of Texas ! With all that food and drink . With all those women of the aristocracy . How did it go , in the north ? " Martin looked carefully at Diego . " My twin , I thought we lost you . And you come back . " " I 'm back . Here I am . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He happened on the journey from Del Norte with the cart and the guard of cavalry and the Remingtons of the Sterner brand . " " I finally saw those Remington this morning . " " They are very good . And how did you leave the Senor Smuggler Sterner ? " " The same . " " How is Pancho Gil ? " " I brought a letter from him to the Castros . Del Norte is lost and Pancho Gil is hiding , with a wet foot , waiting for better times . " " The times are disordered . " " How much longer will the fighting go ? " " Who knows ? But I will tell you something true . This cavalry of General Castro has force . One , we are better armed . Two , we are better mounted . Three , we are better fed . Four , we are better led . " " Andale , what a sergeant ! " " The general is making a battalion of infantry with Indian re cruits from the south . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , pure Indians , brutes . The general gives them a musket and a hundred rounds , and a knife the size of a wagon tongue . They get a little corn ? and all the loot they can take , and they are like a plague . They are tougher than dun horses . Don Cipriano sits in the big house at Valdepenas and Salcido is afraid to go fight him . You see what happens , when Salcido bothers Castro land ? " " What happens ? " " The people of this hacienda and the village of El Carmen ran to the sierra when they saw the Salcidistas coming , and that gang , that chusma de canalla , burned down the gate and made a carnival 1 of barbecues , and fireworks inside the big house . You saw . " We were with El Verdugo at Hormigas , bringing arms from Presidio , when a rider brought word of El Carmen . Three days later , we came . We caught that gang , by a bend of the Rio Carmen . Tomate , tomate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verdugo sent for the General Marcos Castro to come see the hacienda , to come see the captives . He came yesterday . " A bad thing yesterday , Martin . You remember what El Verdugo did that time to the cow thieves at Valdepefias , on that flat place out there at the section of La Novia ? And how the foreman made us ride out , all the vaqueros , to watch it ? " We watched it yesterday . The six prisoners . Our general saw the condition of the big house , he saw the dead stock and the barbarities , and he ordered the six holes dug . We knew it from the kind of holes they were digging , in a line . " Diego spit on the ground , and looked at Martin . " I was not ordered to ride , " Diego said . " The First Platoon rode . The rest of the troop , and all the people , were ordered to watch . So we watched . As you and I did at Novia . A hoof hit one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' it started . And ended , like dropping a rock on a melon . The Senor Teniente of the platoon got permission to march to the Rio Carmen afterwards . The troopers rode their horses through the water several times . " So I have no sotol to offer you . Yesterday I drank all I had . General Castro is not liberal with beef of the Castro brand , you know that . But today you see us with plenty of good meat . The  | general rewards us . Why ? " Diego shrugged . " I tell you , that running over the heads is excessive . " Martin ? I will tell you about being sergeant . It concerns an old acquaintance . With green eyes . With the remembered name of Abran Rascon . " " He was n't one of the heads yesterday ? " " No , " Diego grinned . " Continue , my sergeant . " " It was at Carrizal , coming with the cart . You recall how you mentioned Rascon when I was in Texas ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Verdugo put me to the employ of riding ahead , to the settlements , to arrange for corn for the horses . It is a sometimes profitable work , making arrangements with farmers . " Diego winked . " I am learning . I am now forage sergeant of the troop . " I knew a good man at Carrizal , and I saw him when I went there to search for grain . We were chatting and he mentioned Abran Rascon , who bought grain in Carrizal . He bought it ! I knew it was odd . " I will not make a bother of detail ? but I saw an opportunity . Through my friend in Carrizal , I was able to find Rascon . He made an approach to me , and I told him , like an assassin , the cart was coming . He asked me what it held ? fix yourself to this , Martin ? I told him I thought it bore arms . " " He already knew that . " " Clearly . Well then , he asked about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unguarded , as usual , like a load of petticoats and buttons , to avoid attention from authorities along the way . I told him more of the same mark , after he promised to warn me of the attack ? and to spare me ? it was for me a great risk ! " You see ? So I rode north to El Verdugo and I told him . We fixed a trap . The guard , and the horses without riders , stayed behind , out of sight of the cart . When Green Eyes and his criminals came riding around a bad point ? he gave me no signal , the son of a whore ? I raked my nag and went like a bird . Eight criminals were killed by the heavy fire from the troopers hidden in our cart . ? It was our bad fortune to see Abran Rascon escape ? he  | had a very good horse . But that was not my fault ! El Verdugo hit me across the back with his quirt and made me sergeant . " The story has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sergeant Casas . " " And this cavalry life is better than riding hungry in the hills of Valdepenas ! " " With the great Captain Verdugo . " " It is the same , that part . El Verdugo or the foreman of vaqueros or who else . It is the type , and for us it does not change . " " How do you like the bullets of the cavalry life ? " " I have a rule . Those you hear whistling , do not touch you ? cli Pablo ? " The peon Pablo had come in from the sunlight , and squatted to take the empty frijole bowl from the ground by Martin . " It is a just rule if bullets come from distance , " Pablo said . " From close they do not whistle , they come zas ! When the horse thief Rascon fired at the cart near Carrizal I fell on the ground like a dead man . " " What has happened to that cart , Pablo ? " Martin asked . " It is here , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salcidistas . But no . It remains . " Pablo shook his head . " In Lent we left Valdepenas . Now in a little time it will be Day of San Juan ? " " He misses the favors of his old lady , " Diego said . A bugle blew , with a ruffle of drums , from beyond the big house . " Troop muster . " Diego got to his feet and straightened his hat . " Rest yourself , Martin . I will be back . " " Pablito , " Martin said when they were alone , " how does it go ? " " They say men live only because God is great . And I am alive , eh ? How is it with you , Martin ? How is the north ? The corral of the Senor Sterner . Gregorio and his family . The warehouse of goods . The cook Concha . That wine of Del Norte . And how is the nephew Chico ? It was an amiable time , in Texas . " Pablo smiled . " You came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good faith . " " Pablo . You be sure it was not good faith that brought me south . Tell me , is Lagrimas well tended ? "  | " Stabled with grain . It was a pleasure to watch him roll , que macho , clear over his back , three times ! " " Is the saddle safe , with the gun and cartridges ? " " Very safe . I have been at El Carmen a long time . " " I could sleep , Pablo , with this full belly . Do you know a pile of corn shucks in the shade where I could throw my blanket ? " " Let me show you . " Pablo led him to a brush ramada near the bottle-shaped stone granary on the far side of the adobe corrals . The shade was cool and quiet . Martin lay on his back , on straw that crackled as he moved . His clasped hands on his chest raised and lowered a little as he breathed . The weariness humming his ears seemed to move away from inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taut springs of its sinew and floated , weightless upon the upholding softness of the straw . As his eyes drowsed half closing , he looked out into the space of sky framed beyond the shady poles and dry boughs that made his shelter from the sun . A hawk sailed across the space on unmoving wings . He is looking down on Mexico , Martin thought , losing the thought . He threw the crutches away and gathered the rawhide bricks one by one , loading them higher and higher in his arms . Then he walked down into the water . The bottom shelved off . He clenched his teeth as he pushed out swimming with the load in his arms , and it glided queerly , like the breast of a swan , across the water . The people all saw him and he was ashamed , lifting the load from the river with the rags dripping muddy on the nakedness of his legs . He felt her hand touch him as he came under the tree in the rustle of the heart-shaped leaves . He put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark arch of the leaves she watched him . He slid the long knife from his belt and bent down to slit the rawhide husks and bare the treasure he brought her , when the wind rattled the leaves all suddenly dead and he dropped the knife as he hit at the sharp dry shapes with Louisa Rucker crying . His eyes batted open . He jerked up slapping , to knock from his face the prickle-footed crawl . It landed squirming with a many-legged small rustle on the straw . He stumbled to his feet  | and mashed it with his boot heel , stomping it to pulp in the dirt . " Bastard , " he said in his dry mouth . He rubbed at the itch still sticky hot across his cheek , and looked outside , sweating , focusing his eyes , seeing afternoon shadows stretched out long from the walls . " I slept all day . " He saw Pablo peering around the corner of the ramada . " A damn centipede , Pablo ? " " You were bitten ? " " I bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the straw . " ? And I slept all day ! Why did n't you wake me , man ? " " There was no reason . You rested well ? " " I dreamed . Is there water to drink , Pablo ? " " It is a lack . I have a little olla ? come with me . When the Salcidistas were here , they broke down the hacienda dam . They threw a dead burro in the well of the big house . A part of my employment now is the hauling of the water from the Rio Carmen . ? Here , Martin , drink . " " My thanks , " Martin said when he had drunk long . " You think there is enough to pour a little on my head ? " " Here it comes ! " " Ahhh , " Martin said , shaking the rolling drops , blinking water from his eyes , and blowing . It was cool and good . " It refreshes , " Pablo said , hanging the olla back on the peg . They sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you do when the Salcidistas came ? " " I was with the oxen , down the Rio Carmen , when I heard shooting . Then I met people coming to the hills . We stayed camping for four days , in poor conditions until El Verdugo came and we saw the battle from the sierra and we carne back to El Carmen . " " You knew the Apaches of Fuego were in the country ? " " We knew it and we were afraid . But they went away ! I think they smelled the cavalry of El Verdugo coming . " " The hero Verdugo . " " The devil and his horns ? " An armed trooper appeared from behind the granary . " Bredi ? " The trooper 's voice was hoarse . " I hunt for a Bredi . " " My name is Bredi. "  | " Man , I looked in all parts of this pizzled hacienda . The General Castro is waiting ! Jump ! " Martin stood up . He tucked in his shirt , tugged at his belt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the pistol , " the trooper said . Martin looked at him . " As you wish ? " He handed the pistol to Pablo . " Watch it , Pablo . " The trooper led past the sentries , through the archway , into the patio of the big house . The open square formed by the smoked walls had been cleared of debris and swept clean . The flagstones had been sprinkled for coolness . By a column in the shade stood a camp table and two chairs . At the table sat General Marcos Castro and Captain Verdugo , with a bottle of cognac between them . They smoked cigars rolled from the pungent black leaf of Queretaro . Quick eyes , rimmed with spiky lashes like spider legs , peered from Marcos Castro 's rigid face ; a clipped mustache made a gray line above his gaunt brown mouth .

He wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string thrown up over the brim . It bobbled faintly when he talked . " Bredi , " he said , when Martin stood before him . He tapped Pancho Gil 's unfolded letter by the cognac cup . " Answer some questions . What were the evidences of Salcido 's force south of Del Norte ? " " I saw none . " " Did you see anything of the Apaches of Fuego ? " " Nothing , except mules butchered and rotting . At the sand dunes of Samalayuca . " " Nothing more ? " " There was a raid at Potrero two days before I passed . The Apaches took blankets and stole three girls . " " Did you find sign south of Potrero ? " " No , senor . " " When you were in Texas I received an invitation to cross my cavalry and join forces with the army of the United States ,  | to light Fuego . I was busy . I never answered .

The marvelous Yanquis , calling for help . Tell me , what army force did you see at Puerto ? Describe it . " " A battalion of cavalry , well equipped . The troopers are Negroes . " " I have heard they use blacks : But I never believed it . Who commands ? Is he black too ? " " He is not . His name is Colton . " " Did you ever see him ? " " Once . " " Is he enough man ? " " I could not judge . " " My brother Cipriano , your patron , asked you to observe conditions in Texas . For example , who is the power at Puerto ? That army commander ? " " He is the military power . It is distinct from other power . " " You are saying a commander of a district carries no civil power . Who polices their damn civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My people make their own civil government . They vote for it and they have it . My people more or less police themselves ? Senor General . " " Your people , eh ? Very interesting . Voting themselves to order . More or less . With no police . A marvelous people ! " " They have police . I meant to say it is distinct from the army . " " Go on , please . " " The Texas Rangers , they act as police , sometimes . " " There are Texas Rangers in Puerto ? How many ? " " A company . " " And who buys them ? That is what I mean by the power . " " They are not bought . " " You do n't know that everything is bought ? Shit ! " " The Texas Rangers are not bought . " The general puffed at his cigar . " You have a rare opinion of that pack of assassins . "  | " It is my opinion they are not a pack of assassins . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistolero is in no position to have opinions about assassins . You watch yourself . I will watch you myself . I notice your style of dress . You passed a pleasant time in Texas ? " " Very pleasant . " " It is pleasant to see you back . " The general 's eyes shone unpleasantly . " I presume you yet ride the stallion my brother gave you , after you killed Arriaga at Nombre de Dios . Where do you go now ? To my generous brother ? " " I await the orders . " The general glanced at Captain Verdugo , who sat silently with his quirt in one hand and his cognac in the other . " Bredi , " the general said . " That oxcart you took to Texas ? our captain has a project for that thing , a project in the terrain of the enemy , His Excellency the magnificent Governor Salcido . You will fill that cart with something counterfeit , and take it south . You will go with only the ox driver , as an innocent carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear , in those clothes . I suggest you dress more appropriately to Mexico . You ride guard with that cart and avoid suspicion . In the load will be three sealed canisters , concealed with care . You will deliver the canisters to a man near the City of Chihuahua , detour the city , and proceed south with the cart to Valdepeiias where you will report to your patron ? " Captain Verdugo , what is the name of that friend , that expert , who waits for the canisters ? " " Juan Pardo . Waiting at the village of Minillas . Juan Pardo , Minillas . " " You understand that , Bredi ? " The general smiled . " Frankly , I can not regard this project with seriousness . It is unlikely to succeed . I do it to humor my brave captain who made the arrangements . Nevertheless ? " the general 's smile faded . " You have my orders , Bredi . You deliver those canisters . That is all . " " My general , " El Verdugo said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right through the palace roof . "  | CHAPTER XVI MARTIN RODE up , past the hulking crawl of the cart , and came alongside the peon Pablo carrying his pole by the slogging oxen . Pablo turned and grinned . " They look at the Texan Bredi , " he said . " And then , they believe it . " " It gets harder . Too many lies , Pablo . " " I believe them ! When I hear you explain it . I can see our little mine in the sierra . I can see us taking this ore from our mine to t he smelter of Chihuahua . In our cart . I look at my new patron , the miner Bredi from Texas . I see the black horse he won playing  | monte with a rancher from Galeana . I hear him talking and I believe each word the miner Bredi tells . " Pablo 's eyes glistened , looking up at Martin on his horse . " I wish it was true . " Martin took off his hat , wiped sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saddle , to look back . The governor 's road patrol was out of sight , beyond the twist of the canyon . " It gets harder , " Martin said . The cart wheels screeched a dry duet as they unrolled their broad tracks along the furrows of the road . The yoke straps squeaked chafing on the oxhorns . The big splayed hooves moved slowly along the dust . Martin looked up at the blaze of the June sun , white-hot overhead . " Pan Pintao is laming maybe , Pablo . I think he might be laming . What do you think ? shall we noon ? " " Pan Pintao is a wise ox . He lames near that pretty grove , eh ? Andale , Pan Pintao ! " Pablo turned the oxen out of the ruts and the dust , and the cart scraped complaining down the easy slope to the walnut trees and the trickle of water in the bed of the Arroyo Varas . They unyoked and watered the stock . Martin unbridled Lagrimas , tethered him at high grass under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pablo moved around the propped cart tongue , rummaging at the iron cook pot , Martin built a little fire in the shade . Squatted on their heels , Pablo 's bare , Martin 's in battered Kansas sole leather , they broiled slabs of dried mutton on pointed sticks , and ate it with tortillas and fried beans Pablo brought from the cook pot . When they had finished , they dipped water from the stream and drank . " Contento , " Pablo said , wiping mutton fat from his hands , leaning back , with the thick mat of his black hair against the trunk of a flowering mimbre tree . " The good life , " Martin said , drawing designs with his finger on the shady sand . " A man needs very little , " Pablo said . " And the little is hard to get . " " And to be contento is the hardest . "  | " It is simple . Contento comes from the belly . It lasts a little while . And reaches to the heart . " " Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head is more distant . " Martin lay back , looking up at the rocky canyonside across the far bank of the stream bed . As he squinted at the hot glitter of the stones beyond the green leaves , a cloud , boiling high and white-topped above the rim of the bluff , reached across the face of the sun . It plunged the canyon into a flat and sudden shade . " Pablo . We ought to go to our mine . " " I believe it . " " When we have delivered those three powder cans at Minillas , then we keep going , the other side of Valdepenas , right over the Sierra Madre . " " And fill our cart with gold . " " I am glad we are going . " " With the exception , there would be no gold . My woman would starve alone at Valdepenas . The Castros would catch me and shoot me . " " That way , our mine does not sound so well . " Pablo shook his head . " You tell it much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day is it now , Martin ? " " I lost the count . " " I think it is near the fiestas at Valdepenas . Near the Day of San Juan . " " ? Not very near to Minillas , " Martin said . " Shall we start that cart moving ? " " The cloud is fat , " Pablo said as he got to his feet . " Growing fatter . " The air was sultry when they came out upon the road and moved south in the shade of the gathering cloud . A league beyond their nooning , they passed the dozen wretched huts of a settlement with its patchwork dam and its pocket of rocky cornfields along the Arroyo Varas . Beyond them , the road began a long climb from the narrowness of the canyon . New clouds bulged with unspilled rain above the rimrock as the cart inched up the winding slant of the hill . The oxen set their heads out stiff-necked shoving at the yokes ; silence lengthened  | between each slowed creak of the turning wheels . Martin rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file of musclelegged beasts lean straining with the cart against the long incline . Above them , the clouds moved fast . Their solid rounded edges melted fading in misty gray fingers and coils of lowering scud . Grasshoppers flew from under Lagrimas ' hooves with a yellow skitter and rasp of wings strangely bright against the darkening ground , strangely loud in the silence . A dove called its woe from a hillside thicket , and called again . The first far boom of thunder rolled . Martin rode in toward the cart . " We ought to make ready ? it 's coming ! " " Not yet , Martin ! A bad point to stop oxen ? and worse with mud ! " " It 's coming , man ! " " I see it . We have time . " " I 'm going up to look ? " He touched spur and Lagrimas bounded , clattering stones along the slope . " Arre , bueyes ! " Pablo whacked with his pole . " Get moving , oxen ! Tortas ! You , Pan Pintao ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Fifty yards up the rise , Martin wheeled at the crest , and looked back . He eyed the sky , and Pablo working his pole , and he made a hurrying motion with his arm . The sound of Pablo 's voice , the creak of the wheels , even the scuffle of the ox hooves came to him clearly as he sat the saddle waiting . Not a leaf , not a stem of grass , stirred in the sweating hush . The flame jumped high and fiery before his eyes . The blast knocked him in a slamming wave of engulfing great sound as he t fell , seeing shapes spurtle from the flash . A torn piece whistled , and he ducked down , hearing it thud , hearing another , and another . The black horse Lagrimas screamed and stood riveted , trembling in the sigh of the wave of sound as it settled to silence leaving the smoke and the shapes and the hole in the road . Martin got up staring , shaking as he stared . A sudden wind puff jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat drop of rain splashed burning cold on his face . " Pablo ! " he yelled . He started to run on his shaky legs . " Pablo ! " Shapes , pieces of shapes , lay unmoving , smoking , smelling of  | gunpowder and burnt hair . A spotted ox with its side torn open lay working its legs patiently , scraping in a pool of blood . A dun ox lunged suddenly to its feet , and bawled . One of its hind legs dangled broken . " Pablo ! " Martin called , searching . The ox bawled . A quick gust swept the slope and the rain came slanting , thick , thumping the ground with a padded roar . He found Pablo down the hill near a tazcal bush and a splintered piece of a wheel . He came to it stumbling , seeing the rain spatter glistening on the brown naked back , seeing the black tangled mat of hair in the mud . Blast had torn the clothes away , ripped the right arm from the naked trunk , leaving oozing pulp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lash of the rain . He turned the broken flesh gently , with awkward compassion , and looked at Pablo 's face . The rain hit washing at the blood from the mouth . The rain thinned the thick red , in little splashes . It struck into the staring eyes . With shaking wet fingers Martin tried to close the lids . They opened . He propped them closed , with two flat rainwashed pebbles . " Wait here , " Martin said aloud . " Pablo . " The rain ran between the opened lips . " I will bring you my Saltillo . " He turned away and walked up the slope , where Lagrimas stood trembling in the drive of the rain . " You all right ? " Martin 's voice croaked . He cleared his throat , shaking his head , shaking blur from his eyes . " Black horse . You all right ? " He smoothed at the wet hair on the black neck , feeling the animal heat in the palm of his hand as he patted . " You 're scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of hurt on the dark shine of the hide . " You 're scared , good horse . Huuu ? " He swung up in the saddle . The cold wet of the seat touched sharp on his buttocks . He rode talking , soothing , down the hill to a stumpy juniper where he tied the black frightened nose close to the shaggy trunk . The dun ox bawled , calling the pain . Martin walked fast to  | where it stood with its crooked leg dangling , and he shot between the eyes . The ox dropped , silent in the splashing rain , and he walked on , to the spotted ox . It was dead . Lightning flashed , with thunder pounding in the canyon . A hurtling fork of blue fire cracked close on the rimrock and shattered in the seethe of rain . Lagrimas jerked at the tether and quivered as Martin untied the wet strings from the Saltillo behind the cantle . He carried the folded blanket to the place by the tazcal bush , by the piece of the splintered wheel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nakedness , he covered the face , the pebbles fallen from the eyes , tucking all of it in . He anchored each corner of the blanket with a wet stone , and stood over it without thought , without words to form thought . He heard the rain hit plumping at the tight-woven blanket . It made a faint hollow sound ; he stared at it , watching the drops run from the sides of the shrouded mound . He felt words form slow , building from daze toward thought . It turns the rain . It has turned the rain many a time . It keeps the rain off . It is all I got , that you can use . Pablo . You wo n't ever get back to your woman at Valdepeias and all I can do about it is blame myself and wrap you in my blanket and dig a grave and put you in and go tell your woman how it happened and help her if I can . I wish I could help you . I wish I could show you that Bredi was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 's my fault . I should have made you get away from the cart . Before God , I did n't know those cans could explode unless the lightning hit them . But they did . Someway it 's my fault . I rode to the top of the hill to watch the storm and I 'm alive and you 're not . It was no lightning . I know it was n't . I was looking . It just blew up . And it killed you . It did n't kill the governor of Chihuahua . Nor the general who said he did n't take it seriously , nor that brave captain who thought it up , nor this bastard Brady in the dirty business . No . It killed Pablo . It killed the good and decent man . I do n't know why . He stood shivering by the horse and the dripping juniper tree , with the scattered lumps and shapes dark on the hillside in the thinning rain . When the drizzle stopped , he kicked dry trash from  | a rat nest by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth chattered and his nose dripped wet with the cold as he fanned at the smoky reluctant flame . He had his shirt off , trying to dry it , when the two farmers on the burros came riding the road , from the settlement down the canyon . Martin stood up , and waved the wet shirt . The burros set their feet daintily along the mud and the two riders were silent as they came up to the popping of the flame . Martin looked at them , sandal-footed , in their ragged petate hats , their soggy shirts and drawers of dirty manta . They looked at Martin with his bare white chest and the gun strapped on his hip . " Good afternoon , sons , " Martin said . " Good afternoon . " The farmers looked around . " What hap-pened ? " " You can see . The ox driver ? the oxen ? the ore cart . Leaving only the black horse . And myself . " " The grace of God , " the older farmer said . He crossed himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is there a priest in your village ? " " It is too poor . " " Is there a graveyard ? Holy ground ? " " No , senor . " " Are there shovels ? " The farmer who talked showed his teeth . " I have no shovel , " Martin said . " I have nothing . " " I heard a great roar . Zum ! Before the rain . It was not as thunder . It was very distinct . I came to see . " " You see now , my friend . Can you help me with shovels ? " " The shovels are far . It is late ? " Martin eased two pesos from the money belt around his belly . He showed the silver , holding it in his hand . " These wait for you . It is also a matter of mercy . " The farmer looked up the slope . " And the matter of oxen ? " he asked . " Oxen ? " " The meat . " Martin looked at the two faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shirt on a bush and threw a rotten branch of damp tazcal into the blaze .  | CHAPTER X VII IT SAT like a crown upon a crest . It faced out commanding the immense plain of grass ; at its back the folds of the hills lifted , rise on distant rise to the pale line of the Mother Sierra . Martin Brady looked along the course of the stream that issued from the hills and flowed through the gardens , out upon the fields , into the plain . He looked up the long sweep of the easy slope , to the white wall of the great house and the pink stone of the carved church tower , in the trees .  | I am glad I am seeing it again . Not thinking about anything else , only how it looks , I am glad I am seeing it , Hacienda de Valdepenas . It was where I lived . He rode Lagricnas up the slope into the shade of the straight avenue lined with the ancient trees . Their leafy benevolence arched over him , green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went riding toward the turret-flanked gate . The guard with the gun strapped on his hip waved and stood grinning . " Tocayo ! " he called . " My namesake ! " Martin reined and reached down to shake the hand of the guard named Martin . " Que tal , Tocayo ? " " You got here for fiestas . You were gone a long time , but you got here . " " Do n't tell me I got here on Day of San Juan ? " " Do n't tell me you did n't ! Double fiestas . Very double . Five barrels of tequila for tonight , man , a real drunk . Barbecue and fireworks this year . In honor of the Saint ? and the new governor . Mostly the new governor , eh ? You got back at the right time . All the girls with a bath and their hair washed , smelling good ? " " How is that about new governors ? " " Are you joking ? " " Tocayo , I have been in the hills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governors ? " " Then , friend , there is news . Don Cipriano Castro is governor of the state ! " " Since when is that ? " " Since four days . When he , when all the family of Castro , when the infantry of the General Marcos , when the whole crowd , went to the capital ! " " What happened to Salcido ? " The guard shrugged . " Who knows ? " He grinned . " Something , without doubt . Our patron is governor . " " What happened with the old Governor Vega ? " " You have been in the sierras , man ! He 's dead . " " And his loyal General Severo Cuevas of the garrison ? " " Killed , man ! " " Leaving the Castros ? " " Leaving the free tequila tonight ! How was it in the north ? You are dressed very Yanqui. "  | " It is a long way north . Who stays in charge of the hacienda ? Is the mayordomo here ? " " The same . Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until I see you ? " Martin touched rein . " At the tequila barrel ? " Martin looked along the upper fork of the roadway . It led through an inner wall topped with broken glass in a thick and jagged glitter , toward the church and the great house beyond . The gate in the forbidding wall stood open , for the holiday of San Juan . I ought to take a look , Martin said to himself , my last lodk . He rode the smoothed gravel into the cool of the gardens , by the long borders of maguey . Three women in poor black came down the steps of the church , and Martin tipped his hat . " Good afternoon , senoras , " he said . He thought of Pablo , looking up at the mellow crust of stone saints and scrolls , the pink carved tower of bells , the blue tile dome , the cross of bronze . He thought of Pablo wrapped in the blanket , with the shovels scraping by firelight , with the cross of cart planks set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with hungry people butchering dead ox meat at midnight , quarreling in the dark , with Pablo quiet in the ground , and Lagrimas on the dim trace , through the hills to Mala Noche , to Sainapuchic . To the church of Valdepefias on day of fiesta . Beyond the lacy line of pepper trees , sunlight touched upon the western wall of the great house standing quiet , alone in the flowers . Under the engraved stone of the entrance archway , the iron grilles and bossed mahogany doors were locked shut . Martin rode by them . You need all of it , Governor of Chihuahua . You need a nice church of your own and plenty of house . Patron of Valdepenas , Carmen , El Tigre . Patron now of the state . With your brother and your business maybe you can be patron forever . And have more churches , and more houses . I leave you to it , patron . He came back through the gate , on his way to find the woman of Pablo . Be sure you have plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roadway into Valdepenas was neither smoothed nor graveled ; its ruts were printed thick with the marks of heavy wheels and hooves and bare feet . Martin went the back way , not looking for those who knew him , among the storehouses , stables , shops and barns , along the sprawled tangles of adobe corrals . He moved clear of the dusty plaza , the heavy walled quarters of the mayordomo , the work office , the commissary , and made his way toward the crowded scores of huts and shacks where the people lived who performed the toil within the hacienda 's walls , in its gardens , orchards , vineyards , fields , its pens and pastures and camps , on the million stretching hectares of Castro grass and timber to the mountaintops . The people did not toil on San Juan 's day . They bathed the required bath of the year , early in the morning , and washed their hair and picked the lice and put on clean clothes if they had them and went to Mass with the bells ringing . Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a smell of plenty . Men sat in clean clothes after church , and talked in the shade , impatient . Girls hummed , and put flowers in their hair . Musicians tuned fiddles and guitars , blew at brassy comets , made a few trial tunes , ready for a night of music . Ropers and riders brought their stock to the carnival field across the stream , to wait for the crowd , for the starting guns in the cool of the long afternoon . I ) on Teofilo of the commissary set up his stand of candy and cane nnci aguardiente of Valdepenas . Don Lazaro , foreman of vaqueros , bossed the men sweating with the sides of meat and the fires at the barbecue pits . Don Fulano , the mayordomo , set his police ready , patrolling the carnival field with guns at their belts , roping off spaces for dancing and for rooster fights and games of chusas , draping the pavilion , guarding the fireworks and the tequila barrels , for the evening . The kids of Valdepenas ran everywhere with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smell of holiday , Martin rode looking for the shack of the ox driver Pablo . " Oye , Bredi ! " The voice was peremptory . 1 le turned . The mayordomo came at him on a groomed chestnut stallion , sitting a saddle trimmed with silver .  | " Where do you come from ? " The mayordomo 's eyes were yellow like a cat 's . " The north , Don Fulano . " The two stallions snorted at each other and stood restive . " When ? " " This moment . " " What are you doing ? " " I am here on orders General Marcos Castro gave me at El Carmen , some time ago . " " And the orders were ? " " Confidential . And to report to Don Cipriano here at Valdepefias . I have been in the hills . I did not hear of the new governor until I arrived at the gate . " " The governor and his brother are both in the City of Chihuahua . When will you leave ? " " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some grain , before I go on . " " Still with that black , eh ? ? Tell me , what happened to the big ore cart and those first-class oxen you took north ? Do you know ? " " The cart and oxen were destroyed carrying out orders . The ox driver was killed . I came to report it . " " You were responsible for the cart and oxen ? " " And the ox driver . " " Well , the ox drivers are not so expensive . But your report , it does not concern me . It is no hacienda matter . You understand you are employed now by His Excellency the Governor . A situation of promise for you , Bredi . For us all , eh ? Report to the governor as soon as possible . " The mayordomo spurred and the chestnut plunged away , toward the carnival field . Riding the dirty lane , Martin called to an old man sitting in the shade . " Do you know the house of the ox driver Pablo ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his chin . " Where ? " " The next to the last ? on the other side . " Martin rode to the wattled shack with the leaning wall and the mud scaling from the chinks . It was hot in the sun as he dismounted and stood on the bare ground . There was no door to  | knock on ; he knocked on the scuffed post that framed one side of the opening . A woman finally stuck her head , her hair uncombed , around the edge of the ragged cloth that hung in the doorway . " Pardon me , senora , " Martin said . " Are you the woman of Pablo who went north with the oxen ? " A vague flicker of some feeling between suspicion and fear touched at the stolid black Indian eyes . " Yes . " Martin took off his hat . " I am Martin Bredi , of this hacienda . Pablo was with me in the north . He mentioned you many times . He thought of you . I came to tell you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin in from the sun ; he stood with his hat and the rarnal of the reins in his hands . " There was an accident , in a place called the Arroyo Varas , in the north . Pablo lost his life . I came to tell you . " The woman 's eyes looked at him , without expression . She let loose the door cloth for a moment and crossed herself , then held the cloth tight again . " I was with him , when it happened , " Martin said . " I put him in a grave . There is a cross over it . I was his friend . Do you have any people to help you ? For necessities of life ? " A tear rolled out of one of the Indian eyes , down the brown cheek . " I came to say if I could help a little , senora , with a few pesos if ? " " Aee , woman ! " a man 's voice called from somewhere behind the cloth door . " Woman . What goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thick . " Hear me , woman ? " " An uncle , " the woman said . Martin swallowed . Pity rose to smother at his anger . He turned away and climbed into the saddle . " I came to tell you that Pablo is dead . " He put on his hat and did not look back , riding away . Old Pablo , he worried about his woman . Martin spit on the ground , and rode around a corner , up another lane , toward the familiar hut of the Casas . Seeing it ahead ,  | he stopped Lagrimas suddenly , wheeled and went back . He rode fast , over the bridge of the stream , to the stand by the buntingdraped pavilion on the edge of the carnival field . " I have not seen you for a long time , " the storekeeper said . " Bredi . " He remembered every name in every account book on the hacienda . " I have been riding . Give me the worth of a toston in candy , please , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in paper , to ride with it ? " The storekeeper slid the brown slices of quince candy into the rolled cone of the yellowed newsprint , and folded the top over . He pushed the package and the brandy bottle across the counter , and opened his book . " This is for cash , " Martin said , pulling the peso and the toston from his belt . " We prefer to put it in the book . " " This is cash . It does not go in that book . " He threw the coins on the counter and looked the man in the eye . " As you like . Bredi . " He put the bottle and the candy in his shirt , mounted Lagrimas , and rode again across the bridge and up the lane to the hut of Mateo Casas . Three of the Casas children , playing in the sun , saw him as he came . Their voices shrilled . " Martin , Martin , here comes Martin ! " " Chamacos ! " Martin waved at them . The little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Martin got down , the two boys hugged him around the waist , scuffling , and asked to hold the ranzal . " We 'll tie Lagrimas , " Martin said , ruffling the boys ' hair . " Then you watch him for me . How is everyone ? How is your daddy Bartolo ? And your mama , and the grandfather , and the grandmother and the aunts ? Are you having fiestas ? " Old Mateo Casas stood in the door , stocky , with his great gnarled hands and craggy brown face . He was dressed in a white blouse and leather breeches . Coffee had spilled down the front of his blouse . He held out his arms .  | Martin saw that Mateo Casas was blind . " Don Mateo , " Martin said . He embraced him . " I felt it . I felt you arrive . " The voice was still deep , still rough ? without the power it once had . The two great hands gripped Martin 's shoulders and the blind eyes looked in Martin 's face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see you , behind these eyes . I am glad to see you , my son . " " I am glad to see you , my father . " Diego 's wife and baby and the brother Bartolo and his wife and the two Casas daughters and a husband crowded into the little room by the old man 's rawhide chair . Martin embraced each one . He looked around . " Dona Maria , my mother ? " He knew , the instant he had asked it . The Casas daughter Lola began to cry in the silence . " Four Sundays past , " she said . " That she be in the Glory ? " " God gives . He takes away . " Mateo Casas spoke roughly . " Who has more right than God ? Andale ! This is day of fiesta and Martin is with us ! How are you Martin ? " " I am well . Does Diego know of his mother ? " " No . Diego was here with the cavalry , two weeks before the death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw him at El Carmen . He is probably in the City of Chihuahua , with the troop . With the new governor . " " Are you riding that way ? " " I do n't ? know . " " I wish you were . " The little girl Belita hugged at Martin 's leg . She whispered something . " What is that , Belitita ? What ? " " Martin . Did you bring us something ? " Everyone laughed . " Mmmm , " Martin said . He stuck his hand in his shirt and rattled the paper . " You think so ? " " I think so . " " Here . Your mama will let you have some . And some for the boys . " Belita smiled and hugged his leg .  | " And here is something for the grandfather . A little something for day of fiesta . " He put the bottle of aguardiente in old Mateo 's hand . " Guay !

" " I want you to stay with me and tell the news , " said Mateo Casas . " Bartolo will tend the horse . " " Then let me unsaddle ? keep my saddle and the carbine in this house . " He got up and went outside with Bartolo and his boys . " The blindness , man ! " Martin kept his voice low . " When did it come ? " " The night of the death . He could not see .

" Do n't tell the old one . Are you getting along ? Do you have enough ? " " We eat . Many thanks , Martin . " " I wish it was more . It came from the boss of the mail coach in Del Norte , a man named Pancho Gil . He lent it . I have not been paid by the Castros since I went north . " When Bartolo and the boys had led Lagrimas toward the stable , Martin brought in his gear and sat by old Mateo . The aguardiente was opened , and there were cups in their hands . " Salud ? " the old man said . " Y fuerzas ? " They drank . " Tell me first , my son , how is the leg ? Diego told me how you broke it . I can not see how you use it . " " All well . " " Not crooked ? No pain ? " " In no way . It was stiff when the doctor took off the sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was broken . "  | " Luck . " The old man drained his cup . " It was a good doctor . I was worried enough , sitting crippled , waiting . " Martin smiled . " Don Mateo , the doctor bred his mare of Kentucky to Lagrimas . It was all the ? " A volley of guns popped in the distance ; there were shouts from the field . The bells of the church tower began jangling . " The jaripeo ! " The little girl Belita took Mateo Casas ' hand . " Grandfather ! Martin ! Ca n't we go ? Ca n't we ? " A band of musicians came down the lane ; the guitars were playing in the sunlight , moving toward carnival . The little girl started crying . " Shh ! No , Belita . Not this year . Child ? " her mother said . " We wear black , " Lola Casas said , watching the musicians go . " God knows there is enough mourning , " Mateo Casas said . " The world is full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside , if you please . Where we can talk . Bring the bottle ! " They sat in the shade , around the corner . Martin poured aguardiente . The sound of the crowd on the rodeo field came drifting up the empty lane . " Day of San Juan . " Mateo Casas lifted his clay cup and drank . " I have seen my first one and my last one , Martin . At the earliest one I remember , there was a miracle on my tongue and I never forgot it . I tasted for the first time the sweetness of a crumb of brown sugar . And at the last one when I still had my eyes , I watched you win the Soo-vara racing your black Andalusian horse . I can remember the greatest fiesta of San Juan . There was never any like it , the one when the General Santa Anna came , with all the wine . The old Castro was dueno and Cipriano and Marcos were round-faced boys in velvet and silver , on dapple ponies . I won the forefooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Days of San Juan . I remember your first one , Martin . I have always remembered it . I found you sitting alone in the corrals , bigeyed , hungry , saying words of English aloud . And when I asked you why , you told me you were practicing your tongue , for the time when you would return . " Mateo Casas showed his jagged teeth . " Did you remember your tongue , when you crossed that river ? " " It came to me. "  | " You liked it . There in the north . " " I liked it . " " They did n't remember about Presidio . About the boy I found holding the pistol that night by the river . " " They remembered it . They remembered . " " And they did nothing ? " " They pardoned me , Don Mateo . " " And why did n't you stay , son ? " " I wanted to . The last night I was there ? I shot a man and I had to leave . " Mateo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all good when they chose you from the vaqueros , and armed you . I do not speak as one without guilt . I have spilled blood for personal reasons and I have been in war . Blood is sometimes necessary . It is sometimes desirable . But the life with firearms , it grows ? to a habit of blood . Much blood is much sorrow . I have seen it . You are seeing it . It is the sorrow of my Mexico . Will you live your life in it ? " " I do n't know . I wish I knew . " " We gave you what we had . Yet ? it was not your own . I see that , blind . " " I am grateful for what you gave me . It is much . It is all I have . " " No . You have more . Do you know the word castizo ? Do you know what it means in this tongue you have from Mexico ? " " Castizo ? Good breed ? Good style ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stays good style . I told you that , sitting in the dark . My son , pour me one cup , and then I want to hear music , and taste barbecue . We live , all of us , only a little space from death . " The music was playing when he led Mateo Casas into the crowd at the edge of the field . " I can hear it and I can smell it . " The old man 's great gnarled hand gripped Martin 's arm . " Dust . What are they doing ? " " They are tailing bulls . " " Big bulls ? " " Big enough . " " Not as big ? as they used to be . Who 's riding ? " " Fausto Marocho ? and he tailed it ! The bull flopped and  | landed skidding . Fausto is riding back . He lost his hat . " In the cheering Martin had raised his voice . Mateo Casas grinned . " The Day of San Juan is the best day of the year . Who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He is not horseman ! A little crazy . He is better in a sheep pen ? " Bartolo Casas appeared suddenly , and put his hand on his father 's shoulder . " How do you like it ? " he asked . " I have been looking for you . " He carried little Belita in his arms , so she could see . She was eating quince candy . Her brothers were edging toward the front of the crowd by the fence . The crowd whooped and Mateo Casas boomed , " Tell me ! " in the whistling . " That bull tailed Angel ! Before he could get the tail under the stirrup , it jerked him off ? " The musicians had changed tunes , banging happily at their strings , tooting the brass , singing " The Best Vaquero . " The foreman was very worthy , He stopped and said to me , " How are you at handling cattle , Riding the rough terrain ? " Eee  --  Ha ! What did you tell him ? I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Eee ? Ha ? Ha ! So he showed me an ox and a muddy field And told me , " Start to plow ! " Eee ? Ha ! That 's what he said ! Eeeee ! " The best day of the year , " old Mateo said . Bartolo put his mouth close to Martin 's ear . " Martin ? " he waited until there was less noise . " Don Fulano is looking for you . He sent word , at the stable . " " The foreman was very worthy , eh ? What does he want ? " " I do n't know . " Martin looked toward the box in the pavilion . The mayordomo was there , watching the gate , for the next bull . " They told me to tell you , " Bartolo said .  | " Thank you . " The ropers built their singing rawhide loops in the last sunlight . They forefooted wild mares in clouds of dust like luminous haze . The distant line of the Mother Sierra stood sharp against the glare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charros ran their fastest horses in the early dusk . When the winner of the Soo-vara rode to the pavilion in the shouts , and the first bonfire was lit , the people moved to the fiesta of the night of San Juan , to the barbecues , the barrels , the dancing , the games , the cockfights , the music . An armed police touched Martin on the shoulder . " The mayordomo wants you . " " I have been told . " Martin walked to where Don Fulano stood alone by the chestnut stallion . " Bredi , when do you leave ? " " Any time . " " Could you take an express ? A matter of urgent information from the mine of El Tigre . I received it after I saw you this afternoon . The governor awaits it . Where would I find you when I have the message written and sealed ? " " Here . Eating meat . " The mayordomo mounted his horse . " Thank you , Bredi . This needs a trusted man . " He paused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbecue pits and the barrels . " You know these people , night of fiesta . Even my police ? " " Don Fulano , could I ask a favor ? " " Speak . " " The woman of the ox driver Pablo who was killed in the north , she lives in a shack near the end of the second lane . Very humble . With nothing . Could the hacienda give her a way to earn bread ? The ox driver Pablo served the Castros well . " " I will remember it . " " I will carry your express . " He found Mateo and Bartolo Casas , and the husband of Lola , in the firelit crowd . " Martin ! Get some ! " Bartolo held up browned goat ribs . Mateo Casas turned his craggy face . He was chewing . " Where are you ? "  | " Here , Don Mateo . And hungry ! " " Eat ! The chamacos have taken meat to our women at the house . Sit down . What did the mayordomo want ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patron . " " When ? " " Tonight . " " And you go . To an excellency . To a palace of a governor . And if it happens that you find my son Diego ? " Mateo Casas stopped . He turned his blind eyes toward the sound of the music . " They sing Memory of Valdepenas . ' " The old man 's voice roughened . " And I hear it . With meat in my mouth ? smelling smoke of the fires ? " I carry in my heart the land I knew When I was young and sorrows were not mine . I wish I could ride singing across the plain , And come to the fair place there by the wooded hills , And have my youth again . I belonged to that land , it was my mother earth . I was content with the things it gave me . There I felt the enchantment of the world , The sun was gold on the walls of my house , And I had my love . All my youth , All my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That sheltered me At Valdepenas , The land I knew . The fiddles cried and the voices sang in the flickering light . The sound drifted into the open darkness beyond the people .  | CHAPTER X VIII MARTIN BRADY had breakfast by a farmhouse door at dawn , three leagues from Chihuahua . The taste of the greasy gordas the woman gave him , and the stale coffee , stuck sour in his throat . His bones ached unrested , he felt dizzy from the long motion of his ride , and his eyes stung . When he had given the woman a real , he went to the well in the farmyard and from a leaky bucket dashed water on his face . Then he mounted Lagrimas and rode tired , on a tired horse , toward the city . Other travelers moved along the road in the early light . He passed drivers with loaded burros and files of trotting pack mules , sagging wagons and thin-shanked country nags , haycarts , ox drivers , riders , walkers . Some of them called morning greetings and their dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blaze ; Lagrimas paced the dust along shortening shadows , into the heat of the day . New sweat caked in the hair of the black hide . Insects hummed in the sun-flooded brush by the side of the road . Sweat ran stinging from under Martin 's hat . Around a climbing turn of barren hill , he watched the opening view . The scars of mines on the slopes above the city were bright in the glare ahead ; a thin smoke rose high from one of the workings . As he rode on , the aqueduct appeared , strung out on its masonry arches . The tops of the twin towers of the cathedral showed suddenly . Then , over the last of the rise , set in a crescent of tan mountains , he saw the walls and roofs and towers and domes . A leaf-bordered stream wound around them ; their sharpfaced build of tawny stone and pale mud brick stood graced with the green of trees and pleasant gardens . He rode along a fringe of willows by the chapel of Guadalupe , hearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alameda lined with cottonwoods to the city 's heart . He did not ride to the Plaza . A block from the cathedral wall and the portico of the palace beyond it , he turned Lagrimas into a side street flanked with shops . Porters had sprinkled the cobbles ; he smelled the morning fragrance of the damp stones and he rode them with his horse 's hooves clacking . He reined before he came to the familiar , tall , polished , bronze-knobbed door . A soldier stood armed at each side of it , under the neat sign with the gold letters C. CASTRO Y HNO . The soldiers watched him as he dismounted , and he stood on the cobbles , feeling short , stiff in the legs , dry , dirty . Leaving the rasnal around the pommel so that the horse stood with a stylish arched neck , he tied Lagrimas and moved by the guards , feeling their eyes , into the dimness beyond the tall door . His spurs clinked as he walked the worn flags to the grilled window of the banker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good morning , Senor Roa , " Martin said . The man in the cage shoved his spectacles up on his forehead . He peered . " Where did you come from ? Hm . " " Valdepenas . " " Only Valdepenas ? "  | " I was farther . I came to ask you , senor , where it is best to encounter the governor . I carry an express to him . " " The governor still has residence in the family house . Inquire there . " " One other thing , Senor Roa . I have not been paid since January . I have been in the north . Can you pay me ? " " Certainly not . " The spectacles dropped into place . " It requires a written order . In your case , from His Excellency Senor Don Cipriano Castro de Ibarra y Zamora , Governor of the State , hmm . " " Thank you . Does the cavalry of General Marcos Castro happen to be in the city ? " " Billeted in the former mansion of Salcido @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense ? a campaign against the savage Apaches of Fuego who persecute the north . " " I am grateful for the information , Senor Roa . I will come back when I have seen the governor . " " When you have a written order . " He felt the soldiers ' eyes again as he walked to Lagrimas and mounted . There were other guards ? they wore big gray hats with red chin strings ? standing their posts in front of the house of the Castros . Martin rode past a line of saddled horses , through a crowd of loungers and beggars , by a waiting carriage , and swung down at an iron gate that gave entrance to the garden before the house . He walked to the sentry in the gateway . " I carry an express to the governor . From Valdepefias . " The sentry eyed him . " Who speaks ? " he asked , solemn-faced . " Come on , man . I remember you at El Carmen . " Martin pointed his thumb over his shoulder , at Lagrimas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Castro horse . Tie him . I will tell the authority . " The authority was a lieutenant in a tight uniform with gold braid . A dress sword dangled at his side as he walked across the garden toward Martin , halted in the gateway , and clicked his heels . " Lieutenant Zuniga , " he said . " Aide-de-camp to His Excellency . May I serve you ? " He tinged the word " serve " with his own quality . " I have an express to the governor . From Fulano Zarco , mayor- domo of Valdepenas . My name is Brady . Tell the governor my name : Brady , with an express . " " I will take your express . " " I am sorry , my orders are to deliver it myself . " " So you have orders . You must know it is very difficult to arrange an audience with His Excellency . What does your message concern ? " Martin looked at the lieutenant . " The message concerns the governor of the state . Do I speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice . " Seize him ! " Martin moved back a step and laid his hand on the butt of his gun . " Seize the man ! " Martin stood planted ; the sentry made no move at him . " Insolence ! Gringo ! Seize him , you ? " The lieutenant 's voice brought the sergeant of the guard . " Que hay , my sergeant , " Martin said quietly . " Tell the lieutenant . Tell him I ride for the Castros . " " He does , " the sergeant said . " I know him . " " Are you going to seize him ? " " Senor Teniente , " the sergeant said . " Why should I seize him ? " " Mutinous militia ! Rogue ! You will see why ? when I have you also in irons ? " The lieutenant made a very military about face and strode toward the house with his hand on the sword . He had attracted a gallery ; there were grins at his back . The sergeant stepped over to Martin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have an express to the patron . I have orders to deliver it by my own hand . It offended him that I did not offer a slight fee , a little propina . " " That the bad lice eat him ! The patron is governor and you see what we encounter ? We encounter the military of the parlor . The jokers of girls , the drinkers of cognac , the players of guitars . " " Where did he come from ? " " The garrison . He is official . We are all very official . We have toy swords to screw with . " The sergeant shoved his big hat to the back of his head . He put his mouth close to Martin 's ear . " How did it go with that cart ? With those cans we loaded ? "  | " Bad , " Martin said . " Bad ? Did you ? " he stopped . The lieutenant strode toward them . " His Excellency ? will see you , " the lieutenant said , tightmouthed . His face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , " the sergeant said , " let me hold it . " Martin handed him the pistol . " Follow me , " the lieutenant said . Martin followed him , through the portals , into the courtyard . The exigencies of office had made its privacy public : seekers of favors , imparters of news , takers and givers of bribes , carriers of grievances , of compliments , messengers of good , of ill , sat waiting on benches by potted palms and jardinieres of ferns . Guards walked armed among them . A guard opened one of the double doors at the far end of the courtyard as the lieutenant approached . Martin took off his hat and followed the lieutenant inside , to the private sitting room of the governor of the state . Cipriano Castro sat in a carved chair with his back to a tall shuttered window . At his side stood a table holding a breakfast tray from which he had just taken morning chocolate and sweetened breads . He was alone . " Lieutenant Zuniga ? " Cipriano Castro said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ z more than a trace of Castilian lisp . " Look well at this man . His name is Bredi . He saved me from the assassin Arriaga at Nombre de Dios : I am indebted to him for my life . For your further information , he rides a black stallion , full brother to the Andalusian mount of the General Marcos Castro . When this man Bredi asks to see me , arrange it . Understand ? That is all . When you leave , close the door . " Martin stood looking again at the patron , at the hard elegance of the bony olive face with the black lustrous eyes and the graying , sharply trimmed Vandyke . He was dressed in a suit of immaculate white linen . His pointed boots were as black and polished as his eyes . " You have an express for me ? " " Yes , senor . " Martin handed him the message . Castro broke the seal and unfolded the paper . Before he started to read , he looked up at Martin . " Sit down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever asked him to be seated . He sat stiffly , holding his stained hat , conscious of his dirtiness . The sole had broken loose from the toe of one of the cheap Kansas boots ; in the silence he looked up , away from himself , at a big picture on the wall . It was old and dark , of a Spaniard in armor . His gloved hand rested upon the hilt of a sword and his bony face peered at Martin with lustrous eyes . The beard was gray , sharply cut ? Martin glanced at Cipriano Castro , guardedly , from the corner of his eye . He looked up again and made out painted letters dim on the black background : EL Exc . SR . DN . BALTASAR CASTRO ANO DE 159 ? he could not make out any more . " You bring good news , " Cipriano Castro said , folding the paper and pocketing it . " Bullion from El Tigre is on its way . I may say that a principal ingredient of government appears to be silver ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments . " The lustrous eyes fastened on Martin 's face . " Your return from the north is proof of an attribute I mentioned both to my brother Marcos and to Fulano Zarco : your personal loyalty . I put you in a position of trust in sending you north . You did not abuse my trust . Meanwhile , our situation has altered very considerably , and fortunately . There are many opportunities for those who serve me now . I shall without doubt need a man of your ? background , to aid in certain relations that exist between my interests and the Americans with whom I shall increasingly deal . I trust that I may continue to depend upon you . You will be properly rewarded . " To speak in less general terms , your orders at this time are to remain in readiness until I call you . Inform Filiberto the house man , that you are stabling your horse , that you are to be fed and bedded in quarters here until further notice . Is that clear ? ? You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Spain ? " Cipriano Castro 's eyes moved beyond the painting . " For reasons unknown to me , though I suspect they were commercial , Aurelio Salcido did not loot this house during his ? tenure of office . " " May I ask a question , senor ? " " Speak . " " What happened to Salcido ? " The luster in Cipriano Castro 's eyes sharpened . " The garrison  | commanders of Chihuahua became persuaded that Salcido was unfit for office . He was somehow informed of his troops ' new persuasion , and feared for his life . He fled . " " He got away ? " " We will find him , Bredi . " " One other thing , senor , I ? " " Bredi , there is another point that will probably interest you . The Rascon whose face you disfigured when he stole your black horse at El Tigre ? you saved him for the summit of a career . That same wretch carried the arrangements between parties of good government and garrison commanders . I suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his escape . Treachery compounded ! " " Where is Rascon ? " " We will find him . " " Senor , I would like to mention that since January ? " " Ah Bredi ! One other thing . The General Marcos told me about a mission , with an oxcart . He was angry that you were late ? at Minillas , I believe . Would you explain it ? " " I never got to Minillas . On the road the powder exploded . " " Amazing . " " It killed the ox driver . It killed the oxen and ruined the cart . " " Shocking . " Martin looked straight into the lustrous eyes . " It was hot and still , just before rain . I happened to be looking , and it was no lightning . It exploded itself . The force struck me off my horse . " " Fantastic . " " There was no warning . It blew the clothes off the driver . It blew his arm off . I never found it . " " And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a hill . I was waiting at the top , telling the driver to hurry , the storm was coming , and it happened . I buried the driver by the road , his name was Pablo . He served you all his life . His woman is at the hacienda , with nothing . I spoke to Don Fulano about it . Pablo was a faithful man . I felt his death . And I do not know what caused the explosion . " " It is necessary to believe this story , Bredi ? "  | Martin clenched his teeth . " I have said what happened . Believe what you wish . " Cipriano Castro was amused . " Actually ? I wish to believe you . " He leaned forward in his chair . " Let us say merely that it exploded . You lost my cart and oxen . You killed my driver . " Cipriano Castro leaned back again . " Yet one might consider it fortunate . The palace was damaged enough . Plots of gunpowder are puerile ; they kill the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Marcos it was a barbarity when it was mentioned . ? Enough of it . " Cipriano Castro rose from his chair . Martin stood up . He made a last dogged effort : " I have not been paid since I went north and it requires a note to Senor Roa from your hand . I need the money . You see my ? " " I see them indeed . Very Texan ! Bredi , there is neither pen nor paper convenient , forgive me , I shall arrange it at a less busy time ? " He pulled the bell cord and a guard opened the door . " Guard ! Send for Filiberto . The Senor Bredi here wishes to see him . " Martin walked out . He put on his hat . Like hell I wish to see Filiberto . Lieutenant Zuniga brushed by , with his sword , leading another caller into the presence of the governor . The guard touched Martin 's arm . " Wait here . Filiberto has been sent for . " Martin stood waiting , angry with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he called himself , fool , fool , damn fool . They get me with no money and a tired hungry horse . Fool , it is what I deserve . Coming like a fool to see what a governor is like . I saw . Filiberto came from around a potted palm . " Don Cipriano asks me to tell you I am stabling my horse here . I am eating and sleeping here . Until further notice . " " Mother of God , the way we are crowded ? Where is the horse , eh ? " " In front . " " There is no remedy ! Bring the horse around and I will tell them to let you in . The Chinaman will feed you . You find your own bunk . As usual eh ? "  | Like hell as usual eh , Martin thought , crossing the courtyard , He walked out the portal , into the sun , through the garden , to where the sergeant of the guard and two of his men stood at the gate . " You saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .44 . " I saw him . Thank you . " " A friend waits for you , outside ? " Leaning against the wall in the shade , by Lagrimas , Diego Cass , waited for him . " Hah ! " Diego grinned wide , with the red chin string creasing his cheeks . " I was passing by . And I saw this horse , and I knew ? " " Diego ? " Martin pulled his mind away from himself . " I was coming to find you . I have been to Valdepenas . " " When ? " " I left there night before last . " " How did you find ? but that was night of San Juan ! You rode crudo all the way to the City ! Ehaah ! " " Not crudo . " Diego 's face sobered . He looked at Martin . " What is it ? " " Your wife sends affection . She and the baby are well . She waits for you , she told me to tell you . " " Good . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I tell you that first , " Martin said . " The rest is not ? come over here , Diego . " He took him by the arm and led him around the corner , away from the people at the gate . " Two weeks after you were at the hacienda . You lost your mother . They say she died without pain , and your sisters arc happy that the priest was there . There is something else . The night of the death , your father could not see . He is still blind . Bartoli and the girls take care of things , they take care of him , the best way they can . Your father told me to find you . To tell you . It is the real reason I think why I rode to Chihuahua . To tell you and I am sorry to tell you . " Diego Casas sagged , against the wall . He sat quite suddenly , on the cobbles , and bent over , under his big gray felt hat . Martin looked down , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Martin stood still , until the hatbrim quit shaking .  | Then he squatted , so he could see under the hat , and he put his hand on Diego 's arm . " Dieguito . It strikes us all . You know it . Some with more luck than others . You had the good luck . For instance , better than mine . I do not remember my mother . You had yours , until now . You still have your father ? " Diego came to his feet . He took off his hat , and wiped his face , his eyes , with his sleeve . " I know it , Martin . Excuse me . Now ? " he shook his head . " Asi es la vida . " " You help Bartolo . He is a steady boy . He has the mouths to feed . And when you can get leave from your Captain Verdugo , go to Valdepefias . It will do them good , all of them . They are proud of you . " " I will go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . I am asked to stay here . By the governor . " " What do you think of the governor ? A surprise ? " Martin shrugged . " He had enough to buy the garrison , all of it ! You know who carried the arrangements , singing the coyote tune ? " " I know . And he got away . " " And I do not like to have him loose . Green Eyes has no love for me since that trick at Carrizal ? tell me , how did it go with that cart , from Carmen ? I wanted to ask . " " All bad . Our friend Pablo is buried in the Arroyo Varas . " " Really ? " Diego spit , and shook his head . " Tck ! " He put on his hat and looked at Martin . " Let 's go and take a cup together . For old times . I need a cup . " " Diego , thank you . But I had a ride . The horse needs care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find you here ? " " Ask for me at the back gate . " " Good . " He put his hand on Martin 's shoulder . " Thou art a brother . " Diego went to the rack , and mounted his horse . He rode down the street without looking back . Around the opposite side of the block from the entrance to the house of the Castros , a guard let Martin ride through the carriage gate . Inside the high wall , Martin led Lagrimas to stable . He un- saddled , and saw the black horse watered and rubbed down and fed , safe in a stall with clean straw . A crippled stableman carrying a brass ring of keys unlocked a harness room , and Martin racket ! his saddle and saddle blanket , his carbine and saddlebags and bridle . At a table in the shade by the kitchen , a Chinese in a white apron fed him frijoles and meat stew with green chili , coffee , and hardcrusted white bread dusted with sugar and cinnamon . When his belly was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shown him . He took off his shirt and hat , unstrapped his gun , pulled off his boots , and lay down , with no blanket to put under him , on the rawhide straps woven as springs on the battered frame of the bunk . He wadded his shirt for a pillow at the back of his head , put the gun within reach of his hand , and lying straight on his back , invited the sleep his body cried for . It came to him , with the mournful sounds of pigeons murmuring in their cote by the stable wall . It was a heavy and dreamless sleep . He awoke from it knowing he had slept for hours , and he got to his feet feeling a kind of gratitude to his body , stretching the stiffness from his limbs and his back . Then he sat on the edge of the bunk , and rubbed his eyes , and tried to plan . He looked at the dirty wrinkled wad of his shirt , and he shook it out trying to smooth it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tugged on his boots . He tried to knock some of the dust from his jeans , from his draggled Philadelphia hat , and he ran his hand over the rough stubble on his chin . Two reales to do anything about it , he thought , feeling in his pocket . I could have borrowed maybe from Diego but it was no time to ask that . The governor can buy garrisons but the hijo de puta has no pen nor paper convenient ? He went to the horse trough and ran water from the pump over his head for a long time , rubbing at his face and neck , wishing for soap , for a towel when he was done . Smoothing his wet hair as best he could without comb or mirror , he went back to the cubicle and put on his hat . Then he put on his shirt , tucking the tail in tight , pulling his belt up an extra notch , squaring his shoulders . It damn sure needs no sitting in a stableyard worrying about a man with whiskers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I.os  | Pobres . Or someplace . At least for a shirt . At least I can try . At least I can get a shave and a shine for two reales . He buckled on his gun and started for the carriage gate . " I am going to the Plaza , " he said to the guard . " Make sure you tell your relief about me . If I come in late . " " The girls , eh ? " The guard winked . " The town is full of them ! " He opened the gate . " Con chichis ! " Martin walked the cobbles , through hot strips of sunlight slanting from the west , along lengthening cool shade beside the walls , under the boughs , of the quiet afternoon streets to the city 's heart . In increasing traffic , he came past the tawny wall along the side of the cathedral and crossed the street to the shade of the Plaza 's high trees . A shine boy with his box slung over his shoulder ran up pointing at Martin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin said . He sat down on an iron park bench in the shade , by a bed of bright flowers . The boy put his box on the walk , and lifting Martin 's foot to the scuffed cleat , began work . The clock hands on the cathedral pointed to five , and a bell rang from one of the towers . It blended with the pleasant murmur of the fountain at his back , with the easy sound of voices , of hooves , clicking along the street . Martin sat at ease , unthinking , idly watching the horsemen , the carriages , the pedestrians as they passed . The shine boy worked with his black paste , rubbing it into the marks of the long rough road from the north . Martin did not notice the hack until it had passed , until the driver had pulled up at the curb . He saw the man step from the hack door . He noticed the Panama hat , the tailored trimness , the slight unsteadiness as the figure turned . Then he saw the face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shine box , and he rose up ready . The lawyer Travis Hight from Puerto walked toward him . Martin heard the drawled Southern timbre of words in another tongue . " Brady ! By God ? from the corner of my eye , suh ? and I told the hackman to stop ! " Hight came proffering his hand . His piercing eyes were hazed faintly , his lips smiled above the trimmed goatee . Martin shook the hand , and smelled the liquor .  | " How are you suh ? " " I am all right , Mr. Hight . " " You have been riding . Out in the brush . I see that . " " Yes sir . " " Just get in ? " " Yes sir . " " Where from ? " Martin looked at Hight carefully . " Hacienda de Valdepeiias . " " By God I finally saw that place ! Beautiful . We were down there ten days ago , during the coup . I inquired for you from the Castros . I wanted to see you . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No sir . Just to get cleaned up , some . " " Why do n't you come over to the meson ? I 'd like mighty well to have you meet some friends of mine , gentlemen from Saint Louis , the Continental and Southern Railway . " " I do n't look good , Mr. Hight . " " Devil take that ! I want to talk to you . A business proposition . " Martin looked in Hight 's face . It is a chance . I want to know . I got to take my chance . " You will have to excuse my looks , Mr. Hight . I could n't draw my pay when I got in . I been out where I could n't get paid . I have n't got no other clothes but these . " " Rats ! Get in the hack . " Hight tossed a real to the shine boy , who still knelt on the walk , looking up at them . " There , muchacho . Come on , Brady , we will ride over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brandy we seem to encounter in Mexico . Clean up over at my place . " " You do not want the shine completed ? " the boy asked , worried . " He wants to finish the shine , Mr. Hight . " " Goddammit , muchacho , get on the hack ! Let 's go ! I need a muchacho today anyway . Vamos ! " " Vamonos , " Martin said to the boy . " Finish it at the inn . Get on the carriage , with the driver . " The boy grinned . " Brady , " Hight said when they were seated in the hack . " High cotton , by God , the high cotton and we 're in it ! " He jabbed Martin 's knee with a forefinger. 1  | More liquor than cotton and I am in a jam and I want to know ? " Continental and Southern has the agreement , signed and sealed ! A right of way from the City of Mexico to Puerto on the Rio Grand ' ! A new age ! " Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last link in the line was Chihuahua . To negotiate it we had to have a governor we could count on and we backed your Cipriano Castro . Not only because of his political strength , but because the man owns an almighty parcel of land through which the roadbed must be built . I told my clients . **25;961;TOOLONG logic ! Well , suh . We got to the ear of the President of Mexico . The Chihuahua garrison commanders got notice to drop their bandit Salcido . Castro got from Continental and Southern a thumping fine sum of money in good faith and in consideration for the future right of way . And it all came to pass ! Practical politics in Mexico ? Godamighty godamighty ! " Hight jabbed Martin 's knee again . " Before long , the survey party will be running the line . We want a man like yourself with that survey . You know the country , the people , the Indians . You know the way the rascals operate down here . I have mentioned you to my colleagues from Saint Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . There is also the matter of a little contract for furnishing railroad ties later . I believe that a team like you and myself could handle that very profitably , Brady . This country is opening up suh . For a man who knows Mexico ? " The shine boy had opened the hack door . " Home from the hills , " Hight said . " Feeling very dry . " He got out . " Esperaine ! " he called up to the hackman . " Come on , muchad u o ! " Hight led the way across the wide wagonyard of the inn , to the door of his rooms . He got the key in the lock , and opened the door . " Brady , if you want it , tell the boy to go get the 7nozos and to bring water for your bath , hot or we will cut some throats . Do you want to use my razor , or do you want a barber ? " " I 'm not much good with a razor , Mr. Hight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Traiga barbero tarnbien . Pronto ! " He turned to Martin . " Come in suh . At this point a little  | bottled French wake-robin might be in rousing good order . " I lc stepped to the table and poured two big ponies of cognac from the bottle sitting on the tray with the glasses . Martin picked up a folded square of paper from the floor . " Something put under your door , " he said . He handed it to Hight . Hight read it , tilting his head , turning the paper carefully . " From my colleagues , " he announced . " Another parranda ! By God , the Castros entertain us ! Nothing formal ' as they say . " Hight winked . " Don Cipriano apologizes in most courtly style for the lack of state dinners and formal entertainments in his yet unorganized administration but I find no apology necessary . On tha contrary . Lord God these parrandahs ! Your poison , Brady . Thrc groans ? " Hight tossed off a pony . Martin took a bare sip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the gun on Martin 's hip , and Hight smiled as if he ha remembered something suddenly . " Why did n't you claim that reward , Brady ? " " What was that , Mr. Hight ? " " The reward . I think it was a hundred dollars . For killing th scoundrel in Puerto . " " You mean ? " the words would not come . Martin felt his whole mind tighten , his whole body go ten looking straight into the hazed eyes . " Mr. Hight , " Martin said . I-I heart pounded and he stood ready . " If you are making sport u of me I am going to kill you . " Hight 's eyes came leveling , remarkably clear of the film that ha hazed them . " I am armed myself , Mr. Brady . You are welcome try . " " I want to know , 1 got to know are n't they waiting for me there with the law ? " " I see you did n't know . You know now . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered the clerk and stole t payroll at the Silverton Mine . The company had a reward up f the scoundrel dead or alive . " Hight 's eyes pierced at him now , wise with a thousand coo rooms . " I see you did n't know . If you had been indicted ? ? lii you were not ? no jury in Texas would have convicted . You h a witness . Mr. P. J. Ruelle followed you that night . He saw y  | hit the man with your fist to avenge young Sterner . He saw the man draw on you and he saw you fire in self-defense . I will say this , Brady , had there been a trial it would have been a pleasure to defend you . ? You want a drink ? " " I have one . " " Drink it . ? Here 's how . " The fire went down Martin 's throat as the mozos came in the door with the smoking kettles and the tin tub . " You still want that bath ? " Hight asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another drink . " " Shall I throw my gun out the window , Mr. Hight ? " " Forget it . Here 's how . Salud , as they say . " " Salud . Did the young Sterner , did he get well ? " " I never heard the contrary . " And the old Sterner , Martin thought , with the fire of the cognac and bitterness burning , I see it . He did n't want me around because I knew something on him . And Pancho Gil , he wanted me to ride ? and the two of them , the two bastards , they got up that lie and hold me I could n't go back . But I can . ? What a peroration in final argument suh . Gentlemen of the fury , there sits a man , a man unafraid to defend a friend , a helpless , battered , an innocent friend victimized by a vicious , verminous bully . There sits a man who risked life , who risked all , to right a heinous wrong . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no man ? good God , Brady , the world and the Bar of Texas are losers ! Have a thin one . Let us prepare for a parrandah ! " Martin sat doubled in the hot water , working with the soap , with the fire burning in him . " And how are the Ruckers ? I mean , how is Captain Rucker ? " Martin called . " Fine , fine , " Hight answered from the next room . " Ruckers are inc fpeople . Charming daughter . John Rucker is friendly with that blackguard Heffridge , but John Rucker is no less a damn fine ( carless Christian gentleman . Fought with Hood 's Texans . Did I tell you , Brady , we whipped the damned black Republicans from ullice in Puerto ? Justice prevails . Our little city is booming . Soon to be bound with ribbons of iron to the commerce of two nations . Il  | ? Would you like a touch of this for your glass while you dry ? Want you to meet my friends from Saint Louis . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I will have to see about it , Mr. Hight . " " See here , Brady , you ca n't wear those drawers . Or that shirt . Just a minute ? " Hight came into the room . " Try these . A little short-legged and short-armed ? otherwise ? perfectly proper for a parrandah I believe . " " I could n't go with you , thank you , Mr. Hight . I ? " " The hell you could n't suh . A parrandah is just what you need after a ride in the brush . I ca n't say I right vitally need a parrandah myself , after three nights running , but I am still interested . When Travis Hight stands uninterested in the materials of a parrandah , Travis Hight stands ready to die . " It was difficult to keep the chair from floating out the door while the razor scraped . It was very difficult . Martin tried opening his eyes . The room tilted . He tried closing his eyes . He tilted , himself . He breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he held on , with his eyes open , then closed , then open , while the barber ? also breathing deeply ? bent over him and the razor scraped . " ? Day after tomorrow in the morning , Brady . The first stage to Puerto since the troubles . Do you think you might ride with us ? " " I have my horse , Mr. Hight . " " Splendid animal . Do you race him ? " " Hardly ever . " " That rascal Tod Hogan would be delighted to arrange something . When we get to Puerto . " The shine boy helped Martin on with his boots . They were blacked , and almost shining . Martin stood up . He felt his smooth chin . He focused his eyes . He looked down on himself , in Hight 's snowy shirt . There were pleats on the bosom . The shine boy had brushed the jeans , the Philadelphia hat , and he was grinning . Martin gave him a real . " Keep your money in your pocket suh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tie . Here ? And muchacho , you can take those spurs off his boots ? quita las espuelas , son ! "  | Hight tied the bow in the black string tie , and backed off admiring his handiwork . " ? One thing more , Brady . Unarmed . I , cave your gun here with mine . " " Hate to move without it , Mr. Hight . " " I do recall you were going to throw it out the window . " Martin smiled . " I sure was ? " He unbuckled it . Hight put the gun belt with his own shoulder holster . He stuffed them both into his traveling bag , and shoved it behind the bed . " Under official auspices of the governor of the state I trust we need no firearms suh . Exceedingly official auspices . Parrandah , March ! We are off , the captain shouted ? Come on , muchacho , you 're still hired ! Blow out that lamp . " The keeper of the meson stood by the door , grinning as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked Hight . " Christmas a long way from Chloe 's house suh ! " The lantern on the hack was lit . " La parranda ! " Hight called . " Tu sabes ! " The hackman grinned and saluted , and they got in . " Cigar , Brady ? Havana . None of that bilious black leaf ? " They lit up , and sat puffing , driving through the darkening streets . A high moon stood in the clear sky . It appeared to be two moons when Martin looked up at it . The carriage appeared to move with a marvelously strange roll through the evening air . I jl And I can go back , Martin told himself . The warmth was hot in his middle , it reached to his heart . Going back , going back , the hooves clacked on the street . Going back , going back to my people to my country going back . They were out of town when the hackman stopped at the huerta and they got out hearing the music of strings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves , on the big felt hats of the two guards with guns and leather breeches , by the door . " Buenas noches , senores ! " the guards said . " Muy buenas noches ! " Hight said , pulling the bell rope . " Ah the Senor Lo ! " Martin heard the voice say . The tall woman was handsome . She had a spangled gown and raddled cheeks . " I wish , " Hight said in his best Spanish , " to present my intimate friend the American Senor Green . " " I have much pleasure , Senor Gree ! "  | " The pleasure is mine , senora , " Martin heard himself say . " Ah and such Spanish ! Come in gentlemen please ! " The patio was lit with Japanese lanterns and moonlight , and crystal lamps on a long table draped in white napery and spread with a plentiful buffet . By a trellis of honeysuckle , the music played . The girls were dressed in bright gowns , with glitter at their throats , and white slippers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Tina , and Chepa , and Mariquita and Cotita and Lencha and another and Ana who was pretty stout and Dolores and Maria Luisa and two others and Trini who was something . It seemed she had a little mole on her neck like Magdalena used to why remember that ? It seemed that the gentlemen from Saint Louis were very glad to meet him delighted these parrandahs fine old Latin custom talk some business tomorrow these little brown queans suh on swivels it seemed like on swivels . It seemed that the waiter by the other table kept bringing the cold wine in the long-stemmed glasses bubbling tickle your nose that Trini really believed he came from Nueva York only did they speak such good Spanish none of the others talked true Spanish Senor Gree it is because I am a true man and I speak true Spanish to a truly beautiful girl . It seemed that oysters were a nothing more like calfslobbers and the goose liver Mr. Hight said that is what it was was better but the ham and turkey was the best damn good with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bad salty with that cold wine Trini ? Martin straightened . He brought his eyes to bear . " This is Lieutenant Zun-unigah ? " he heard Hight saying . " Aide to His Excellency . Lieutenant may I present an intimate friend of mine very well known in Texas my friend Mr. Brady . " " I have had the pleasure . Good evening Mr. Brady . " " Good evening . " " I trust you find the entertainment pleasant . " " Very agreeable , Senor Teniente . " " I am enchanted . " " I am enchanted equally . " He watched the lieutenant 's back moving across the patio . He saw other uniforms , other gold braid , by the long white table . " Had no idea you knew him , " Hight was saying . " Quite a lad  | with arrangements . Especially these arrangements ? you have them , Mariquita , your arrangements are superb ? " No good and I should n't , Martin tried to think , but the lanterns doubled , then tripled and what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cold wine better Trini you are a trick with everything all built in of course Nueva York is bigger than Guanajuato Trini everybody there has houses big as cathedrals true the carriages are gold plated big steam trains with a thousand cars run on tracks up over your head they whistle like mockingbirds but they do not have jarabes Senor Gree Greegree ai that naughty Mariquita and Cotita see what champagne causes without clothes what a pretty barbarity do you like that my chulito they have no jarabes like that in your Nueva York but they do have them here Trini not here my chulito here and all the hot suns the long times the rough roads the loneliness forever the empty world rose up in fire and died quenched dead clinging in the dark . " Senor ! " Both the title and the voice awoke him . He opened an eye and squinted , painfully , against the glare of sunlight from the open door . He saw the girl in the wrapper standing by the bed . She shook him by the shoulder . " Senor ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin 's eyes came open . " Who ? " " Soldiers ! Of the governor . " Martin sat up , and wished he had n't . Stone hammers pounded inside his head and his mouth felt full of rusted iron . Its fumes choked and he coughed with the hammers cracking at the bones of his skull , the sick meat of his brain . He groaned and put his bare feet on the cool tile floor . " I will help you dress yourself , " the girl said , and she helped him . The boots were the worst . " The duena is holding the soldiers , senor . She wishes you to I id hurry . ? Here , the shirt . " The girl buttoned him and he stood swaying . " Ready ? " the girl asked . No powder covered the tan skin of her young face . Darks like faint bruises spread under both her eyes ,  | from the inner corners of the lower lids outward to the bones of her cheeks . She put her hand on his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head closer . " Will you come back ? Please ? " Martin looked down at her , ready to be sick . He held himself . " Something to tell me , so I will know , " he said , with the fuming iron in his head . " Art thou clean ? " " I am clean . " " The truth ? " " Believe me , senor . " " Huh , " Martin said , " I am sick , forgive me . " He stumbled out the door and was sick by the honeysuckle . He straightened ' p with the hammers and the anger in him raging , with the iron in his throat . " Show me to the backhouse . " " Now , " he said , when he had crossed the patio again . The tall woman gave him his hat at the door . Two armed soldiers in garrison uniforms were waiting . There were three horses tied at the fence beyond the orchard . " What do you want ? " Martin asked . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would like to go by the meson . To wash , to ? change the shirt . " " I feel deeply . That is impossible . The governor waits . Th Senor Governor . " The sun was hot , the horse was rough . Martin was sick again , i the street . At every pound of the horse 's hooves on the cobbl Martin felt his backbone ram into his skull . " I have to wash myself , " he said when he got off at the iro gate , in front of the house of the Castros . The guards in the bi hats were grinning . " Tell the lieutenant . " Lieutenant Zuniga 's face was ravaged with his night before , b his gold braid was neat . He stood straight . It straightened Martin . " His Excellency asked for you early , " the lieutenant sai " When you were not in your quarters , it gave him no pleasure , assure you . " Inside the double door at the end of the courtyard , Cipria Castro received them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised . I am not pleased . Are you drunk ? " The hammers pounded . " I ask your pardon for the way I look . " He tried to clear the roughness from his throat . " I was not permitted to clean myself before I came . But I am not drunk . " The lustrous eyes appraised him . " Very well . You are sober . I have something sober to discuss with you . Sit down . " Cipriano Castro motioned the lieutenant from the room . When the door was closed , the governor of Chihuahua seated himself and looked in Martin 's face . " You give me to understand you are in condition for sober discussion . Am I correct ? " The hammers pounded . " Yes , senor . " Here it comes . " Aurelio Salcido escaped by way of Coahuila . He crossed the river at Eagle Pass . My informants brought this news late last night . They state Salcido is on his way to San Antonio in Texas where the remains of a revolutionary junta await @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive , Aurelio Salcido is a threat and a danger . To me , to my government ! " Do it right . Do it right , the hammers pounded , you better do it right . The worst morning of all your life to think do it right and you better do it right or you are gone . " ? And my attendant confidence in your ability , in your loyalty ? or I would not have you here . You understand I am prepared to reward you . " Cipriano Castro turned . He brought a buckskin purse from a table drawer and held it out , offering it casually to Martin . Do it right . Martin took the purse . It was heavy . " Thirty gold onzas , Bredi . I assume this amply pays you for your recent time in the north . I assume it amply provides expenses for your journey to San Antonio . I assume you know this is a mere token ? upon your return , with proof , there will be many onzas awaiting you , or title to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may sensibly desire from a governor of a state . That is my promise . I assume you know I do not break a promise . " The hammers pounded . Martin licked his dry lips , tasting the iron , holding the gold in his hand .  | It seemed the picture of the Spaniard looked at him from the wall it seemed Cipriano Castro sat wearing the armor suddenly and might have a sword ? Martin focused his eyes , tearing at the blur in his head , fighting it . " You understand , Bredi ? " " I understand . " Do it right . " Thank you , senor . " Martin stuffed the purse in his pocket . " There is another thing you must understand clearly . I assume you know your ? odd position . I assume you know that you have enjoyed my personal protection in the face of the law , both of Mexico and of the United States . " The lustrous eyes surveyed him . " I am fully informed of the circumstances that brought you to Mexico . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappearance of a valuable cart and oxen and a driver , to mention a recent example , that might demand explanation in the face of the law . I mention this only to assure you that I am confident your conduct will warrant my personal protection in the future . You under-stand ? " I have to do it right . " Yes , senor . " " It is a matter for immediate and decisive action . The sooner , the better . There is a stage to Presidio this afternoon . " " Senor . I will ride the horse . It is necessary . A fast horse . " " I leave the method to you . " The lustrous eyes bore in upon him . " I shall receive reports of your progress in the direction of San Antonio , of course . " " You will have them , senor . " " I say no more . ? Bredi , Lieutenant Zuniga surprises me wit information that you were with the Americans McQuigg , Hight , Peters and the other , last night . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is a cordi man . " " Is that so ? What passed between you yesterday ? " " Nothing . Nothing but drink , mother of God ! Somehow I lef my pistol at his room in the meson . I will see him again before leave this afternoon ? " Cipriano Castro almost smiled . " If you had champagne , I advi. no water this morning . You will regret it . "  | " Senor , I already regret it . " Cipriano Castro did smile . He stood up and offered his hand . Martin shook it . The smile faded . " Good luck , Bredi . " " Thank you , senor . " You did it right , so far , you did it right . Do it all right . He walked to the stableyard , and washed his face at the horse trough . The Chinese cook gave him a cup of hot black coffee , and his stomach held it , in doubt . With his head pounding , with his pocket bulged and heavy with the buckskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polished , bronze-knobbed door . He put the purse on Senor Roa 's counter . " Senor , I have some onzas here . " " You have indeed , hmm . " Martin stacked them . " These eight are my pay for the months in the north . Four of them I take for my spending . Please change them to silver pesos . These other four I wish to send to Mateo Casas of Valdepenas . Can you send them to him with the next messenger to the hacienda ? " " It can be arranged . The charge is one tostOn , hm . " " I will pay it . Change this peso . " " Very well . The four onzas go to ? " " Mateo Casas , vaquero , Hacienda de Valdepenas . " " Any message ? " " Say only : From Martin . Salud . " Senor Roa wrote it carefully . " Very well , " he said . " Now , " Martin said . Do it right . " These twenty-two onzas making 352 pesos I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish you to keep them until I return . Until I return to Chihuahua . " " Very prudent , Bredi , hm . " When Roa had finished writing he peered at Martin through the spectacles . " Prudent . And rare , for a man who rides . Thrift is the base of good fortune , hm . Here is your receipt . " " Thank you , Senor Roa . " Martin walked sweating to the store beyond the Plaza and stepped in under the sign LA TORRE DE BABEL . He bought a pair of drawers and sox and a handkerchief , a heavy gray shirt , a pair of  | leather breeches , and a blanket ? not a good Saltillo , he could not afford it ? and he paid twenty-three pesos and walked out with his big package . Beyond the trees on the street by the palace he caught sight of the hangman El Verdugo , the captain of cavalry with the quirt on his wrist , riding the high-headed bay . Martin watched the thick back ride away down the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is the sorrow of my Mexico . " There goes the sorrow of my Mexico . In one package . No . It ca n't be wrapped in one package . There would be no Verdugo without a Marcos Castro . There would be no Marcos Castro without a smart brother . The sorrow of Mexico , it goes wrapped in many packages . But the pain of Mexico ? this morning it goes wrapped in one package for sure , it goes wrapped in this damn fool head ? But I am doing it right . A hack from the Plaza took him to the meson and charged him two reales . The shine boy answered the knock on the door . He looked tired . " Brady ! Glad to see you ! " Hight was in shirt sleeves and needed a shave . " Just in time for a morning soother ? some fine menudo , God bless it , and a little hair of the dog . How did you fare at your parrandahing suh ? Here is Mr. Peters , Mr. Gibb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this . You leaving with us tomorrow , to Puerto ? " " I wish I could , Mr. Hight . I found out I have some things to tend to . " " But we will see you up there ? Wo n't we ? " " You will when I can get there . " " We are counting you in suh ! " " I am sorry I ca n't go with you . I came by to thank you . To bring your shirt and drawers . Mr. Hight , I lost your necktie . I want to pay you for it , and pay to get your things washed up , and for my shave and everything , yesterday . " " Good God , man , I am paid by the pleasure of your company ! I will hear nothing further about it . " " I like to pay my own way . "  | " Nothing more about that , Brady ! This gruel is mighty strengthening , is n't it ? I recommend a public monument , gentlemen . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned sensible recommendation . Brady , I trust at least you will be with us for the final grand and glorious parrandah this evening . General Marcos Castro will be our host . The general himself led our escort when we came up from Zacatecas to Valdepenas . The general is a bon vivant . Quite a host . " " I have to ride , " Martin said . Hight and the gentlemen from Saint Louis were interested in Martin 's rig when he came from the next room wearing his new shirt and leather breeches . He had on his Philadelphia hat and his spurs and his gun again , and he carried his new blanket over his shoulder . " Mr. Hight , please give that old wad of my clothes to the shine boy . He can use them . I left your shirt and drawers in there separate ? and I am obliged to you . I want to say that was some parranda ! " " Have a thin one with us , Brady , before you go . " He had the thin one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , and he had a beer , cool , alone in a saloon by the Plaza . It was midafternoon when Lagrimas stood saddled in the stableyard and Martin loaded on the saddlebags with the ammunition , the dried meat , the full bag of pinole , the morral with cracked corn . He tied on his new tin canteen , filled with water , and his new blanket , behind the cantle . He mounted , and rode out the carriage gate . At the edge of town , he did not take the Presidio road , nor the road to Coahuila . He put Lagrimas in a long-paced rack , and took the road west . His head pounded again as he went , facing the sun , facing the mother mountains of Mexico . Tell Chihuahua good-by , black horse . Say good-by to all 3eiiores de horca y cuchillo , all the lords of gallows and knife ? ad/6s ! The shortest way out of the state of Chihuahua is over the sierra and we take the shortest way , Lagrimas black horse . The ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see big count ry . Over the big slopes to the top , to Sonora . We will see clear  | CHAPTER XIX HE SENSED rather than saw the movement on the slope above the trail in the twist of oak trunks and tangle of leaves . Then he saw it , the white patch on the rump , the antlers moving , and he slipped down from the saddle , easing the carbine from the scabbard , watching . He saw it again . It stopped to look back , head up , its big ears twisting forward . He aimed . The sound crashed in the silence and he saw the gray shape struck . It tumbled in the echoing sound . There was no movement at the place in the leaves as he stood watching . Lagrimas snorted .  | Martin turned and motioned to the man on the little mule , with the four loaded pack burros , standing still in the trail a hundred varas down the hill . Then he stepped into the stirrup , swinging up with the gun still in his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked with his eye . The buck lay dead with a broken back . I am shooting high , Martin thought . Uphill , and still I am shooting high ? He got off , cleared the empty , uncocked the hammer , and slipped the gun back into its scabbard . With the knife from his belt , he cut the buck 's throat and pulled the head around to bleed downhill . He cut the glands from the legs , and made the long opening , with care not to slit a gut , from vent to chest . The warm entrails were out , smoking in the shady grass , by the time the man came up from the trail leading the big burro . The man was grinning under his stringy mustache . He pushed his straw hat on the back of his head . " How good ! " he said to Martin . " Big ! And fat ! " " Your meat , Justo . " Martin smiled , wiping blood from his hands on a clump of grass . " Plenty of meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bacanora . " They loaded the butchered deer on the squeaky pack saddle and tied it in place with cords of nnecctte . Sunlight angled yellowing through the trees as they entered again into the shadowed trace , and rode on , with the empty mescal barrels retied high on three of the packs and the venison joggling on the other . Half a league over the slope they came down into pines by the side of running water and made camp under the high rocks on a shelf above the stream . When the animals were unsaddled , and Lagrimas and the little mule were tethered and the burros hobbled for the night , Justo built a fire in the chill of the sierra 's October dusk . Martin sliced tenderloins from the buck . He and Justo ate them broiled on sticks in the firelight , with tortillas , and frijoles from a pot . The stars came out and they saw them between the black boughs . They heard the wind in the pine tops and the water moving on the dark rocks . " The trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hand  | of man . The sierra is not troubled . I have thought about it . The sierra is too big for the hand of man . I carry mescal from Bacanora over the summits to the towns thirsty in the east five and six times in the year , and I see the sierra always in peace . It has the wild beasts , yes . And the wizards and some things of magic . But the affairs of men are small in it . " " Every night you mention wizards , Justo . You have seen wiz-ards ? " " Guamas , chiseras , naguales . There are many . I carry this against their powers . " He showed a metal cross on a string around his neck , and sat silent , looking into the fire . " What powers do they have ? " " Many . " A knot popped in the fire , scattering sparks . " Only a fool doubts their force . " " I have never seen any wizards , of those names . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sierra there are also bandits . One time they robbed me of my cargo and entered upon a great drunk . But bandits are few . And Indians ? Only Tarahumares and God in His wisdom made them timid ! In the matter of fierce Indians , here it is too far east for Yaquis , and too far south for Apaches . Thanks to our Lord Savior . " " You believe Apaches never come to these sierras ? " " Who knows ? They might . But I have not seen them . I do not want to see Apaches . " " I have told you how they catch an unarmed man and crack his head open with rocks . " " But that is in Chihuahua . I do not go far in Chihuahua , I have never been beyond the mine of Yepachic . These sierras are better . The Apaches stay north of here . Senor , tell me , you still have strong desires to go north ? " " Very strong . " " Tomorrow the best trail forks . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I am sorry . It has all been good . " Justo looked into the fire . " It is understandable , that a man wishes to go back to his own country . But going north ? those Apaches ? fiuu ? " Martin smiled . " But you , Justo , here in your sierra with wizards . Guamas , chiseras . What were the others ? "  | " Naguales . " " What are they like ? " " They make an odd sound in the air . They are great thieves , senor , robbing up to life itself . I prefer not to discuss them . " Before the fire died , Martin went into the dark and took the morral from Lagrimas ' nose . " Good horse , " Martin said , in the huge darkness . Up the slope , the bright stars of Orion lifted above the rim of pines . That is an old hunter , Lagrimas , I used to see him at Kingdom Prairie when I was a boy and he came climbing over the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , with a big bright eye . But that hunter coming over the sierra now ? he 's from back there in Chihuahua . He do n't see us . He better not : we will plug him right between the eyes . Must be his gray sombrero up there ? see the red stars ? Chin string . It 's no sword he carried now , it 's a knife for sure . And there 's his Remington ? I guess that dim star is a fly speck from Sterner 's . The dog has n't come over the sierra yet ? but it wo n't be a dog . It will be a horse . One of the geldings from the horse pasture at Valdepenas and he will run his legs off and wink his big eye and never catch us . Lagrimas rubbed bumping his cheek against Martin 's chest ; Martin ran his hand on the black hide of the neck , down to the foreleg . He patted the foreleg . That hunter nearly got us . You know that ? You hidden in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over there on the bad side of the sierra . You a cripple and me a damn pelado pushing a plow for our keep and trying to stay hid out . Do n't you never throw another shoe ! Look where you go throwing those hind feet , you worthless old stud horse . They nearly did get us . But they ca n't now . We are in Sonora . Sleep good . The coals glowed red , thinning , in the silence beyond the sound of the wind and the water . Martin lay down to the . comfort of the earth , wrapped in his blanket , with his guns by his hand . An owl awoke him in the dark , and the wind blew harder before he and Justo rose in the blackness and rebuilt their fire , with the morning star above the rim . They cooked venison in the growing light , hearing wolves howl from beyond the dim ravines.  | They had been on the trail an hour , their blankets wrapped under their chins , their animals ' legs vet with dew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the trees from Chihuahua . Martin looked through the pine boughs , down at the sloping tumble of the mountains opening out westward under the pale pink of the sky . As the sun warmed him , he folded his blanket to his saddle and rode the trace in the silvery light with Justo at his side on the little mule , driving the burros with the barrels and venison , among the trees . In the midmorning they came down a steep slope to a long plateau rimmed with mountaintops . They rode out upon the level , in grass faintly gold from first frost . The stalks were stirrup high and they rustled with the tread of the hooves in the sunny quiet . Justo turned in his saddle , and reined . " Here it is , " he said . There was regret in his voice . " This is the Mesa del Tabaco . On the one hand ? " he pointed ? " the trail goes for Sahuaripa , for Bacanora . On the other ? " he used his whole arm to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points through that notch called Paso del Aguila , to Bavinuchi , and beyond ? " he shrugged ? " to all the north . You will not decide to continue with me , senor ? In Bacanora my house is yours . " " Thank you , Justo . My direction is north . " " Come to my town someday . Make a proof of hospitality . Make a proof of the finest mescal in all the world , which I will furnish you ? mescal de pechuga distilled through the breast meat of wild turkey . It is exquisite . " " I would like to taste it with you . Tell me , Justo , do you know what I will find first on the trail that goes north ? Is there any settlement before Bavinuchi ? " " You stand on land pertaining to the Santos family . Over the edge , toward the notch ? " he pointed ? " following the water ? so ? you will find a rancho of the Santos . There are workers living at the rancho . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame as good people . You will find them . " Martin put out his hand . " I am grateful , Justo . For everything . " " The gratitude is mine , " Justo said with the handshake . " That God our Senor take you by good road . "  | When she had gone fifty varas , Justo 's mule turned her head toward Lagrimas , and brayed . The men waved , grinning . Martin watched Justo and his animals grow small across the widening plain of grass . They shrank to five little dots . They disappeared . Martin felt his own smallness , alone in the immense mountains under the immense sky . He felt the southing autumn slant of the sun at noon as he came over the edge of the mesa and rode under trees again . By a high oak on the stream bank he unsaddled , and dozed for an hour while his horse grazed in the shade . Squirrels and bluejays chattered at him . Cloud shadows moved , patches of rich blue , along the slopes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank , before he saddled again and rode on . Cow tracks were thick along the trace he rode , but he saw no stock . As the tangle of tracks climbed from the rocky stream , up the shoulder of a hill , a familiar sound came to him and he stopped ' to listen . Herded cattle bawled in the distance . Over the hill he came into a wide glade shelving to groves by the water . The glade was a grassy cup set in timbered slopes and at its far side a hint of dust hung pale in the trees . From it came a rise and fall of bawl and bellow blended by distance into a rustic music . Martin rode toward the dust and the sound . He saw a corner of a big adobe cabin , and a fence . He saw an edge of cedar-post corral gray in the shade , and then the cattle , many cattle , of many colors . He heard a faint shout , and smelled cedar smoke . He smelled a thin whiff of burnt hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . Martin reined and waited , carefully . The vaquero , in leather and a ragged hat , came toward him . " Good afternoon , " Martin called . " Que bubo ! " The vaquero was young . His face was scratched from wild rides in thick brush . " Where from ? " Martin made a motion eastward and upward . " The sierras ! " " Where do you go ? " " The United States ! " " Eeee ! Far . What do you do ? " " Vaquero , miner . A little of many things . " " You are Mexican ? "  | " No . I lived in Chihuahua , but not any more . You see me headed for my country ? riding the sierras on my way . " " Hunting mines , eh ? How did you come ? " " From Jicachic . Using trails to Sahuaripa . I came with a mescalero from Bacanora . " " You came on a good horse . Andalusian . " " A very good horse . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your orders . " " Agustin Santos . I am at yours . " " You are the family of Santos of Bavinuchi ? " " That is my family . " " Would you tell me the trail to Bavinuchi , Senor Santos ? Does it follow this water to Paso del Aguila ? And beyond ? " " You are riding for Bavinuchi ? " " I am on my way . " " Why ? You see us here finishing our corrida ? with a good camp . My father is with us . He will talk to you ? travelers from Chihuahua are rare ! " " Well , " Martin said , " I smell the branding . I can help , if you need another hand . Your father is the patron ? " " Yes . " They started toward the dust . Agustin Santos ' father stood by the branding fire . Martin knew he was patron the instant he saw him : authority stood written in the set of his head on his shoulders . It was a working authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or solemnity . The leather clothes that cased him bore the rips of rough rides and stains of many camps . Iron buckles clinked on the outer rawhide metazas sheathing his bowlegs to the thighs and he wore spurs with long rowels and steel jingles . Strapped on his hip was a black-handled .44 . " Is that all ? " he bellowed at the bellowing herd . A mounted roper came dragging a roan bull calf at the end of his rawhide . " The last ! " shouted the roper . Martin watched a vaquero go down the taut reata and spill the jumping calf . The vaquero 's hat bounced off . He swore in a high  | tenor , laughing , with a twisting grip on the doubled foreleg , and two men ran to help him hold . One of them slipped the recta from the bawling calf 's neck when the roper gave him slack . The patron himself took an iron from the fire . In a fetid puff of white smoke , he burned his mark on the stretched flank . He cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a practiced skill he turned and took hold of his calf 's big scrotum , sliced off its end , squeezed out its testicles , cut its cords , rasped " Go , ox ! " and strode to the fire . He threw the testicles in the pile that broiled on the coals at the edge of the flame , wiped his hands on his leather breeches , and bellowed again , " Is that all ? " " That 's all ! " came the answer . " Epah ! Turn them out , Calixto ! Set a guard to hold the steer herd , and those heifers ! " " Exactly ! " Calixto shouted , riding . " Oye , Father ! " called Agustin Santos , in the noise . " Look ! " " Eh ! " Martin saw the eyes . They were the color of wild honey . They turned at Martin quick and sharp ? with good humor in their amber lights . There was no suspicion in them . Martin was not prepared . " Santiago Santos , " this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At your orders . " " Martin Brady , to serve you . " " He hunts for mines , " Agustin Santos said . " And rides that black nag ? " he pointed at Lagrimas tied to a corral post , his neck arched . Santiago Santos looked at the horse , and then at Martin . " Well , " Santos said , dry , " enough pony for a ride to a mine ? " The voice was loud . It carried some sound of the winds , the herds , the rocky canyons . Martin liked it . " To tell you the truth , " Martin said , " I am not much miner . " " I did not hear your name precisely , senor . " " In English , Martin Brady . They say in Spanish Martin Bredi . " " Martin . Clear enough . You are English ? " " No senor ! American . " " You speak good Spanish , man . You are Texan ? "  | " I have passed some times in Texas . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pass some times in Texas are like bisnaga thorns . Well , we manage . With thorns of all types . Have a little egg ? " He stooped and stabbed on the end of his knife a nicely browned spheroid split open by the fire . He offered it courteously . " Thank you , Don Santiago . " The patron stabbed up another , for himself . His son Agustin and half a dozen vaqueros were helping themselves from the coals . As they stood by the fire , Santiago Santos looked up at the sky , at the gathering clouds in the late light over the trees . The tilt of his head exposed a sharp Adam 's apple covered with a grizzled stubble . It bobbled as he blew on the hot testicle before taking a bite . " Rain tonight , the sky says , " he announced , taking the bite . " Camp with us , Senor Martin , and stay dry . Pen that stallion where he will not chew ears from my remuda , and camp with us . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat , to drink . " " Many thanks , senor . Are you holding a herd tonight ? " " Why do you ask ? " " If I could help , with the night guard ? " " Vaya ! What are my vaqueros for ? " " I am vaquero and I have been riding lazy . Tonight I could relieve a tired man who has thrashed the brush all day ? to help , senor ? " Santiago Santos grinned under his big mustache . " Que raro ! " He looked in Martin 's face . " You are my guest , not my vaquero . " The rain came thick , straight down in the twilight . It soaked Martin as he unsaddled and penned his horse . The man with the high voice , who flanked the calf , came to help . He brought Lagrimas cured mountain hay from a tumbled rick , and a little corn , while Martin stowed saddle and bags and blanket and rifle under the roof of the shed by the rancho 's cabin . He watched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he checked the gate again , before he moved cold and wet toward candlelight . He came into the cabin too late for the counting of the ears . Each man had brought his string from his saddle , each hairy pair of pendants on that string proof of an unbranded outlaw he had  | caught alone in the sierra and taught for the first time the jerk of rawhide and burn of iron . In the bragging and joking on this last night of corrida , the patron ? alert for chicanery ? had counted the strips of ears on each string ; the champion of the corrida , according to custom , had been proclaimed . His whiskers were curly , his name was Domatilio ; he carried a knife strapped in a sheath on his left forearm . He would get a golden onza in Bavinuchi , and he grinned , and bragged the most . They ate in the light of tallow dips , a dozen men in soggy leather , laughing and chewing , with the rain sounding on the roof , and cold drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to Martin 's taste , and fiery meat floating in chili on the tin plates . There were tender dainties to pick from a bull 's head that had roasted caked in clay and buried in hot coals since dawn . There was coffee with milk and sugar , in tin cups . There was a scarred little cask of mescal for the cups when the coffee was gone . Santiago Santos belched and clicked his cup to his guest 's . " We say in Bavinuchi : Para todo mal , mescal . Para todo bien , tambien ! " Martin laughed and drank . " I listened to much mescal from my friend in the sierra . He came from Bacanora . " " Then he can speak ! In Bavinuchi I can give you something from Bacanora : mescal de pechuga ! It is the best . " " I have been told . Don Santiago , do you leave for Bavinuchi tomorrow ? " " Before the sun . You ride with us ? " " With your permission . " " With pleasure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " The pastures up here are the best I have ! You see the beginning of our equipatas , our season of winter rains . They keep this grass strong all winter . No , tomorrow that herd starts a little trip . This year I send heifers to a rancher near Ures , and beef steers to market at Hermosillo . " " That is called a little trip , Don Santiago ? "  | " Oye , each year in the fall , since the times of my grandfather 's father , the Santos make a drive . Some years as far as Guaymas and the sea . It is a custom . It is a good business . We miss only in times of war , or Indian trouble . This year my two sons , Agustin and Andres , go in charge of the herd west from Bavinuchi ? Andres is in Bavinuchi now , you have not met him . Here in the sierra last week he roped a wild one . Taking up slack with a vuelta , his rope jerked ? you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddlehorn . He now carries the senal . " Santiago Santos laughed and held up his own nine fingers . He looked over at Agustin . " That Santos lacks the mark ! " Agustin grinned . " I prefer the mark of a good roper , my father . A good roper ! Five on each hand , eh Martin ? " " Many lose them , " Martin smiled . " You know , in Texas they keep the end of the rope tied on the saddlehorn , and save their fingers . " " And break their thick heads jerked to the ground , " Santiago Santos said . " Holy God , how intelligent ! The ten-fingered Texans . Do you rope ? " " Not in the class with Santos . " " Vaye ! Where did you learn ? " " At the hacienda where I worked in Chihuahua . " " What hacienda ? " " Valdepeiias . " " I have heard of that . " Santiago Santos scratched his ear . " Wait ? that is property of the new governor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Many years . " " And you only a vaquero ? " " I was one of a hundred vaqueros on the hacienda . But I have not worked cattle for a long time . Castro armed me . He made me guard on his silver trains from El Tigre Mine . That horse I ride is a gift from Castro . I carried a pistol for him . " " It appears more fitting to your type , carrying a pistol . More fitting to that horse you ride . " Santiago Santos pushed his hat back and Martin saw the shiny baldness of the brown head . " What type is this Governor Castro ? " " I left his employ this summer after he got to be governor .  | I owe him nothing . He owes me nothing . I want to carry my own pistol . In my own country . Where I belong . " Santiago Santos ' tawny eyes regarded him . " A man should live where he belongs . " Santiago Santos carefully made a corn-shuck cigarette . From his jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tindercord , his flint and his steel eslabon . He struck fire in the tinder , blew on it , lit his cigarette , pinched out the fire in the tinder , rewrapped his equipment in buckskin , inhaled on the tobacco , and looked at Martin . " We Santos , " he said , " we live where we belong , I think . We have lived in Bavinuchi since the times of the king Carlos III . He granted us the land . A Santos was Marques of Sonora . We do not produce any damned marqueses in these times , nor any damned politicians either . My grandfather said it was better to own land than to govern it . We Santos produce rancheros . I wish there were more of us . By the time there is fuzz on our cheeks we have learned the music of the bull pens , we know horses and firearms and these sierras . We like them . I would not be content elsewhere . Nor would my sons ! ? When were you in Texas ? " " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my father . But in the spring of this year I took an ore cart north for the Castros and I spent more than two months on the Rio Bravo at the town of Puerto . There are good people at Puerto . I have a job offered me there . That 's where I 'm going . " " And you go by all these sierras ? " Martin searched the honey-colored eyes . " I have good reasons to go by way of Sonora . I have good reasons to leave Chihuahua . I am not ashamed of my reasons . " " A man is entitled to his own reasons , " Santiago Santos said . " Decent men have decent reasons . " " Where is your father ? " Agustin asked . " Murdered at Presidio . Fourteen years ago . " " Fourteen years , and you have gone alone ? " " No . A vaquero and his family at Valdepeiias treated me as a son . I was lucky . " " Vah , you appear more Mexican than Texan ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | Three guards , relieved from their watch with the herd , came in for their supper . Water dripped from their hatbrims , from the blankets they hung on pegs by the door . The big spurs on their sandals clinked as the men moved piling their plates with meat . Squatted on the floor by cups of mescal in the dim light , vaqueros were singing . The high tenor led off with ? " Here comes the spotted bull , Son of the blue roan cow ? " and the verse unwound with harmonic howls from all the throats , all the coyotes in starlight celebrating a sierra that reached to the sky . " ? Shouting at the vaqueros : Leave that wild bull to me ? ' " " Don Santiago ? " Martin called , smiling in the racket , " I would like to stand a guard ? " " Angels of Christ , forget that ! ? Oye Calixto ! " he said to the dripping foreman who had begun to eat , " is the rain thinning out there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And the cattle quiet . " It was quiet when Martin lay down with his blanket , by his saddle , under the shed . Ragged edges of clearing cloud moved fast above the trees , and stars showed . The air was sharp and clean , pungent with the washed boughs of pine and cedar . A faint breeze came stirring the bough over the shed ; the last dripplings of the rain fell in a flurry on the roof , pattering with small sound . Santiago Santos and his men , and his herd , were quiet in the cold dark of the sierra . Martin closed his eyes and slept . He dreamed , as he had not dreamed in years , of Kingdom Prairie , of his grandmpther 's house , and the barn . It was very plain . There was Minny with a new litter of pups rooting at her dugs ? seven pups , and the runt not getting a thing . He saw them through the planks of the corn crib , and he knew he was in the cow house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof , and he could hear the wind sigh . There was something warm and comfortable about the rich smell of the cow in the stall ; and there was Lady , the buggy mare , half asleep  | by the door , with her tail tucked tight . He smelled the harness as he squeezed close , through the frosty door crack , and walked out into the snow . In the silence under the lowering sky , he saw Kingdom Prairie , and Brady Grove , and the line of Sugar Creek . It was strange how he heard snowflakes hit with the faintest small hiss as he walked past the hot ash hopper in the white quiet , around the corner of the familiar house . He knew he was a little boy . He climbed the snowy porch steps and opened the parlor door , and saw his father . He saw him with his black beard , with his uniform . His father said , Christmas Cheer , Mart ! Hug your old dad ? Martin reached up in his dream . Is the war over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you home with us now ? No , the war is n't over , Mart . When will it be over ? I do n't know . The uniform was frayed , muddy . The straps , with the two bars , were tarnished on the gray shoulders . We will have our Christmas and then I go back . You smell that goose your granny is cooking ? Dad . Are we winning ? We are trying to win . Do n't track the floor , his grandmother said . She was basting the goose . The kettle of greens from the cold cellar cooked steaming . He could see the pan of high-rising yellow corn bread . I brought you a gourd of popcorn and a jew's-harp , Mart , his father said . But Santiago Santos , with his blanket to his chin , came to the door in the dream . I have brought the horse , my friend , he said . Martin heard the words in Spanish . Oh Jim , his grandmother said to Martin 's father , Mart ca n't go with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying . Martin 's father said , The Kansas rediegs are going to burn this house , Mother , and you are going to die and I have to take this boy wherever I go . I want to go with you , Martin said . It is necessary to go now , Santiago Santos said . That horse will take you . It is a good horse for war .  | Martin saw it was Lagrimas , very black in the whiteness of the snow . That is my horse , Martin said . You will never ride it , his father said in the dream . Until I am dead . The words were in Spanish and Martin cried .  | CHAPTER XX A RIDER coming toward us , " Martin said . Santiago Santos had reined . He sat straight in his saddle , squinting into the mountain light , the mottle of shade through the oak brush , the broken outcrop of granite down the tilt of the slope . " Just one , " Santiago Santos said . He touched spur , and they moved on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees , along the far foot of the granite . They rode with the lead steer 's steps rattling on the rocks behind and above them . The herd came following , a slow flow of spotted hides down through the timber . The hundreds of hooves moving brought a dull rumble and scrape into the air ; their noise  | made a steady undertone to accents of sound down the pitch of the slope , a pop of a branch breaking , a shout , a vaquero 's whistle peeping like a chick , a slap of rope on rawhide , a clatter of rock gone tumbling , a heifer bawling . It was a continuing stream of sound , alive , in the mountain silence . The bobbling dot on the trail grew bigger . " A sorrel , " Martin said . " With light mane . " " Andres rides a sorrel . Hu ! I think that is the sorrel ! That is Andres ? " He pulled off his hat and waved it wide , with the sun gleaming on the bald top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they moved faster toward him , down the slope . Martin could see the white on the left hand as it waved . " My boy Andres . My eldest . With the nine fingers . ? Epaaah ! " he bellowed down the trail . " I thought you were home ? " he took breath " ? with sucking calves ! " Andres Santos came riding to where they could hear his voice plainly . " More damned noise up here , " he grinned , " than a saloon on Carnival Tuesday ? " The point of the herd moved past them as they met in a clump of mountain mahogany beside the trail . " How is the hand , son ? " " Good . Nearly well . " " I am glad . This is Senor Martin . From over the sierra ? My son Andres Santos , Senor Martin . " They shook hands leaning out from their saddles . " Listen , Father , " Andres said . " Some news last night . I thought I " Wait a minute ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Capataz ! Ride the point ! Keep them moving ! Andres is here ! Wants to talk ! " Calixto waved acknowledgment and spurred , knocking stones as his horse jumped , down the slope . " Now . What news ? " Santiago Santos asked . " Hey , Brother ! " Agustin Santos sang out . His horse came bounding toward them from the flank of the herd . Andres waved with his bandaged hand , and turned to his father . " They say we have Apaches . "  | " Who says ? " Santiago Santos frowned . " Apaches where ? " " Last night a rider came in , to Bavinuchi . He says the Apaches have come over the sierra . They had them in Techapic four ? five ? days past . Seventeen of the people killed . This man was from Techapic . I do n't doubt him . His teeth were still rattling . " " Thunder of Jesus , Techapic is too close ! Which way were they headed ? " " The man said north ? they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sierras here and going north ? they do n't do it ! They do n't come in here ! " " They did this time ! There is word why . Some damned Chihuahueno general whipped them and ran them over the sierra . " " I doubt that . " " It is what they say . You have n't seen any sign , up there ? " " No sign of a sign ? " Santiago Santos turned to Martin . " Did you see anything , farther up ? Heh ? " " Nothing . The man of Bacanora kept saying the Apaches did not come in here . " " Not for twenty years ! Nearly twenty years . The last time they came we gave them something to remember . It was at a narrow place called La Trampa below the Mesa del Tabaco . We had Yaquis help us and we made an ambush and we killed sixty , sixty brutes of damned Apaches and they never came back . God , I am sorry to see them back ! The last times they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The drags and the camp pack mules had gone by . The noise of the herd came from the canyon narrowing below . " We get those cattle down ? We set lookouts around Bavinuchi ? " I have already set them , " Andres said . " Good . One of the vaqueros must ride back to the rancho and warn our people up there ? " " I will , " Martin said . " That is for me , " Agustin said . " The devil , " Andres said , " I am ? " " Shut up ! " his father said . " None of you ! You are staying with the herd . " He spurred and they followed him down the hill .  | When they caught up with the drags , Santiago Santos shouted . " Domatilio ! " Domatilio wheeled his pony and tipped his hat . " Listen , Champion , " said the patron . " How is that knife on your arm ? " " In good health , Don Santiago . " " Listen to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You ride back to the rancho . Tell my people up there that I have received report of Apaches on our side of the sierra ? at Techapic ! Tell them I do not think there is much danger now . Tell them the Apaches must have already moved north , toward their own range . But you tell my people up there to watch ! To live prepared . To keep the horses up . To send word if there is anything we should know ! You come back to Bavinuchi tonight and report to me . Your onza will be waiting . Andale ! " Domatilio tipped his hat again , and started fast , up the swath of muddy tracks . " I will tell them ? " " See that you do ! " They rode in the drags , with the herd moving down the canyon ahead . " How is your shooting eye , Martin ? " Agustin grinned . " For Apaches . " " Bad without doubt . " Santiago Santos turned in his saddle . " Who is that cabron of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lap ? Martin ? do you know if there is any such type ? " " I think so , Don Santiago . Named Marcos Castro . He has fought Apaches before . He has his own picked troops . He is brother of the governor over there . " " Castro . And you know him . I would not believe they could produce any such thing in Chihuahua . If they have ? God damn them ! Putting Apaches on us ! Castro . May rats piss the milk of Castro . " " Well , senor ? " Martin half smiled , " I have those sentiments . " " Hah ! I knew that . " As they rode following the herd into the deepening notch of the canyon , an eagle came sailing above the bluff . " Paso del Aguila , " Santiago Santos remarked . " Well named . "  | The eagle turned gliding down on its great quiet wings , over the treetops , to tilt in a slow airy climb again against the blue , and hover , and glide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' eyes cut around from the eagle to Martin ? " they shoot well ? " He asked it fast , challenging . " Shooting is noisy . " " The devil himself has already heard us ! " The three grinning Santos jerked their pistols , with their heads thrown back watching the sky . The eagle came curving again . Before the Santos had aimed , Martin drew and fired . He knew when he touched the trigger : it was that fast snap shot a marksman makes a few times in his life when the ball seems guided beyond fallible act of eye or hand , with the target in the mind and the hit known queerly , foreseen before the flash . In the cracking bang feathers popped loose high in the air , and the Santos horses jumped . Lagrimas stood steady , trained ? the Santos noticed it . The eagle hit the ground twenty paces up the trail . " Angels of Christ ? " A vaquero came thrashing from the drags . He was craning his neck , inquiring . " Nothing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the herd . " Foolishness ! " Awkward with his bandaged hand , Andres cut a wing from the eagle and tied it on his saddle . Agustin pulled big tail feathers and stuck them in his hatband . " For the kids at the house , " Andres explained . The stretched curve of the eagle 's wing was a feathered perfection . " This Pass of the Eagle ? " Agustin said . " Pa f ! " Martin felt good . " This pass of the pure accident ? " He had to laugh . " No more eagles , senores ! Never ! " Santiago Santos guffawed . " That was the eagle of the history ? " he looked in Martin 's face ? " with documents . Passport from Chihuahua , eh ? Vaya , it was the passport from that damned Texas ? and enough petards , sons ! " He spurred again . " Welcome to Sonora , Martin ! There are Santos cattle going to Bavinuchi ? " In the smell of pine and cedar , in the light of late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down and saw summer , suddenly . He was not prepared for the depth of the Barranca de  | Bavinuchi , for the steep fall of shade on the bluffs that walled it , for the sparkling river that watered it , for the loamy banks that nourished it , for the fields , gardens , orchards , groves , and houses that adorned it . Martin looked across the ravine , at the darkly timbered continuing wilderness of sierra , blue beyond blue , ridge beyond ridge , paling to the lost edge of the world ; and he looked down again into the depth before him , upon the miniature , ordered cluster of white walls and bright greens and rich browns , upon Bavinuchi nestled along its clear water , certain of its haven in the shelter of the riven stone . Martin felt Santiago Santos ' eyes , and he turned toward them . " What a country ! " Martin said . " You like it ? " The heads of the grama grass were little golden sickles in the sun as the horsemen rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a dry slope , down where the trees thinned to runt tascal , and farther down , where the earth stood bare by prickly brush and sacaton . Tall branching pipes of patahaya and tangled plates of thorny nopal grew from the broken canyon rock along the slanting zigzagged trail . Downstream from the walls of Bavinuchi , the trail led them at last into the rank foliage on the canyon floor . It brought them down a narrow lane between cornfields , to the road along the river . The herd broke , bawling , through the willows to the water 's edge , and drank , wading , roiling the clearness of the stream . When Santiago Santos had issued orders for holding the stock during the night ? with guards in a rock-fenced hayfield under the bluffs across the water ? he motioned to his sons and to Martin , and they left the herd . As they paced up the river road , a muffled fall of tumbling water made a soft sound in the warm sundown quietness . The sound grew louder ; Santiago Santos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you like our mill ? " He pointed . He had to raise his voice in the noise of the pouring splash as they rode by . " My brother Domingo built it ! " The pale foam spilled from the high turning wheel . The mill stream ran through a grove of dark-leaved trees . " Oranges ? " Martin asked .  | Agustin reined . He reached over and pulled at a branch . " Here , " he said to Martin . " Try one . " Martin held an orange in his hand . He smelled it . He smiled . " I never have seen an orange growing . I never have eaten an orange since I was a boy . " The spicy redolence of the little globe in his hand was as strange as the summer dusk in the canyon . He thought he had never tasted anything so good as the sweet running juice in this orange of Bavinuchi . " We had oranges at Christmas , " Martin said . The Santos all laughed at Martin with his orange . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluffs seemed to Martin a thousand leagues away . The house of Santiago Santos was a rambling thick fortress in the trees ; its whitewashed walls were pale in the last daylight . Beyond the house , in a corral of high stone , the horsemen unsaddled . The curved fronds of a date palm stood dim above the wall . When the saddles were racked and the horses stabled , Martin walked with the Santos toward the glow of candle lanterns , in the sound of shouted greetings and barking dogs . The tang of green chili pods roasting , and cedar smoke , hung rich in the dark balmy air . The family of Santos were gathered to greet the leatherclad head of the clan , to eat and drink with him , upon his return from the sierra , from the reported terrain of raiding Apaches . Agustin Santos politely led Martin into a great confusion of introduction , with nods and short handshakes , to sisters , uncles , aunts , cousins , to married relations , to nieces and nephews and infants and children playing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of names had thoroughly confused him , Martin stood aside , smiling in the warmth , the cordiality , the noise . He looked around the long candlelit room . It was floored with hewn timbers smoothly joined , spread with bright Indian blankets and tanned skins of bear and mountain lion . Yellow and black upon one of the thick whitewashed walls was a great jaguar hide . Fastened to the opposite wall was a weatherstained silk banner embroidered with the eagle and serpent of Mexico and the words COMPANIA MILITAR DE BAVINUCHI ?  | EQUIDAD EN LA JusTicIA , and beyond it , hung on pegs , a country arsenal of muskets , rifles , pistols , swords , knives , and their accoutrements . In a niche at the far end of the room , beneath a carved ceiling beam , two candles were lit before a gilded wooden image of the Virgin of Guadalupe . " Enough Santos , eh Martin ? " Agustin smiled . He had his arm around his young wife . She was pregnant and laughing . Andres held a black-haired baby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his voice louder than ever , disclaimed to his heavy-set brother Domingo , and the frowning thin rider from Techapic , any sign of Indians in the sierra . Martin saw musicians coming in the door . One carried a homemade harp , and there was a guitar , and a fiddle . There was a drum made from a bladder skin stretched on a big wooden bowl . Santiago Santos ' daughter Elena ? and Martin remembered her name clearly ? came passing a tray of little mescal cups to the men of the family . Martin took a cup , and she smiled at him . Her teeth were very white , her eyes were very black , her waist was very slender . " Will you dance to the music tonight , Senor Martin ? " she asked him . " I wish I could , " Martin said . " Why ca n't you ? " " Martin ! " Santiago Santos bellowed in his big voice . " Come here ! I was saying something to my senora . " Martin saw the robust woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had a high comb in her hair . She had just come into the room . " This is our guest from the sierras , " Santiago Santos said to his wife . " He kills eagles blindfolded at three thousand varas . I think we need him with us while our boys and vaqueros are at Hermosillo . In case of Apaches . Martin , this my senora , Dona Adela . " " I am at your feet , senora , " Martin said , bowing his head to the matriarch of the Santos . " Welcome to your house , " she said smiling . " Listen , Martin , " Santiago Santos said , with the candlelight shining on his brown bald head . " That is mescal de pechuga you are drinking . Tell me , do you like Bavinuchi ? "  | CHAPTER XXI DON MARTIN de Bavinuchi , Martin thought , lying in the soft bed , with the first light touching his room . Don Martin was a gringo , they say , but he never went back . He liked Bavinuchi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . He is of the Santos family . They have fame as good people . Old Don Martin , with his children , his grandchildren . He married one of the Santos . Dona Elena , she was a beauty in those days . She was the prettiest of all the Santos girls , and Don Martin , he made the best ranchero of all the Santos sons . He worked harder . Don Martin was the one that found the mine , the Lost Mine of the Holy Name , that made the Santos so rich . The old Don Santiago  | Santos possessed a chart made by the Society of Jesus a hundred years before his time ? you know the story ? when the Jesuits were driven from Sonora . The chart was in the Santos family papers . Santiago Santos showed it to Don Martin when he was a young man , when he first came to Bavinuchi , he trusted him that much , and Don Martin , he finally found the mine in the sierra . That was when he built the big house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim beams of the ceiling , in the daybreak silence . That was when , he thought , when Don Martin better get up and go soak his head in cold water . Now . The black chanate birds were gathered , fluting their jangled morning songs under the pomegranates and figs as Martin walked from the house . A sunrise breeze rustled in the date palm by the high corral wall ; first rays touched coppery on the top of the western bluff high above the shadow along the quiet river . Bavinuchi awoke in the growing light . The first cook smoke rose fragrant from its chimneys . Martin lifted the rawhide thong that held the gate where Lagrimas was penned . The black horse 's head went high , and he blew , showing the white of his eye , as Martin came toward him . " Don Martin and his fat horse , " Martin said . " You like your new shoes ? " He looked down at the four black hooves he had shod the day before . Whistling softly between his front teeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefoot and looked again at the healed marks by the frog on the sole rimmed with square-edged new iron . Remember how that looked at Pacoromachic ? And now look ! The two tubbies of Bavinuchi , letting your cinch out , letting out notches on my belt . Where shall we go on the new shoes , tubby ? You think we might hunt again for tigre and bring home another big spotted hide for you to snort at ? Shall we kill another bear ? Or will we go again to Techapic looking for Apaches that are n't there , or to Sahuaripa with Don Santiago to buy more sheep ? Or will we just lay around Bavinuchi forever and court the girls with serenades and eat our heads off and call each other Don ? He heard a sound at his back , and turned . The old harelipped herder Torquato , who tended the milk  | cows , grinned at him over the gate bars . He held up something in his hand . " Get one ! Come on ! " " Get what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Listen , man . Do n't stand asking , with the mouth wide , like church doors on Day of Corpus ! Follow me ! For something exquisite . " Torquato kissed his spoon . Carrying a spoon he got from the cook in the kitchen , Martin went with the old man , to humor him . " The breakfast of the saints , " Torquato said . " In heaven . " He ran his tongue along the edge of the harelip . Potbellied Domingo Santos stood waiting by the cowshed . He had on his iron-rimmed spectacles and he was smiling . " Ha , Martin ! Torquato cooked it for me in the night . It makes us think of when we were young ! " On the lid of a feed bin Martin saw two halves of a ripe pumpkin . It had been split open and roasted . A sugary brown crusted at its golden edges . It still smoked faintly . Torquato put down his spoon , and picked up a half of the pumpkin , holding it underneath with one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from the heat . He went to a cow in a stall , and he milked . He filled the golden cavity of the roast pumpkin with foamy white spurts rich from the udder . " Calabaza a la Bavinuchi ? " Domingo Santos chuckled at it when it stood propped on the feed bin lid . He dipped in his spoon . " Ah ! " " Ah ! " said Torquato , wielding his own spoon . " I learn something every day , " Martin grinned . " All good ! " He spooned at the sweet pumpkin meat in the hot creamy float . A rooster crowed morning in the corral . As they stood eating , they heard the jingle of spurs ; Santiago Santos came striding around the corner of the shed . He stopped , shoved his hat to the back of his head , and burst out laughing . " I get invited to this crime ? " " We were going to send you half , Chief ! " " Criminals ! You were not going to send me a damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know pumpkins in Bavinuchi are  | not so bad as pumpkins in proverbs ? But they taste better in a corral ! Torquato ? fill the other ? " A vaquero jerked through the corral gate . He left it open . " Patron ! PATRON ! " His eyes were round . He ran . He did not tip his hat . " Ho ! " Santiago Santos gruffed , frowning . " Indians ! The Apaches ? " " What ? " " The rancho ? Rancho del Tabaco ? up there ? " " Calm yourself . Then speak . " " Patron ? " the vaquero swallowed , breathing hard . " At the first light , when I was at the lookout , the one in the rocks toward Paso del Aguila , I heard it . Then I saw . It was , I thought it was Indians , it was the boy of Garcia from the rancho . His horse foundered , that black-nosed gray . He could not speak , the boy . He fell in a fit . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Burning . Killing the people screaming ! His family , his mother , God guard us ! He ? " Santiago Santos turned to his brother . " Ring the bell , Domingo . Man , woman , child , to the big house ! You are in command there . Get them together ! I will order the armed party ? " He turned to Torquato who was pale in his leathery face . " Saddle my horse . Then come to me . " Martin started away , to saddle Lagrimas . " Come back here , " the patron snapped . " You stay with me until I tell you ! " He turned to the vaquero . " Where is the boy from the rancho ? " " I left him , with the other man in the lookout . The man Pancho Silva . The boy is in a convulsion of fear . If the Apaches are sighted from the lookout , Pancho Silva will fire the gun of alarm . I rode down only to tell you . " The bell at the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Santiago Santos said to the vaquero . " You are mounted . Go find the horse herders . Give the word that every horse and mule comes to this corral ! Now ! With the devil riding your buttocks . Then report to me . " The clapper of the bell pounded fast , racking the air with a steady clamor .  | The amber lights in Santiago Santos ' tawny eyes were very sharp when they turned at Martin . " If that scared boy tells truth , Jesus Maria , that poor crowd at the rancho ! But we ca n't go . Wasting our force up there . Not until the threat to Bavinuchi itself ? is past . " Listen , Martin . There are two ways the Indians can get into this Barranca from the Tabaco side . They can come by the trail from Paso del Aguila . Or they can sneak down the rough wash two miles downstream . We could ambush them at either place , and angels of the sweet Christ , I wish my boys Andres and Agustin and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them we have n't got enough to cover the approaches and still have good men to defend the big house if the Indians break through . But maybe we have enough . If we are organized ? " Go saddle your horse . Ride to the El Aguila lookout . You and Pancho Silva hide yourselves high and watch the trail . As soon as I can , I will send you a few armed men . You know how vaqueros are when they are armed : watch them . You are in command . You keep them up there , and you stay ! Until you are relieved . Keep your party hidden high in the rocks , over the trail . If the Apaches come , make your people hold their fire until the Apaches are under you ? and then lift the lid of their brains ! If they do not break under your fusillade , fight them any way you can , sell yourselves dear ? keep the brutes from this valley , Martin ! A lookout on top the house will be watching , in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can muster behind these walls . I will command a party over the dry wash downstream , and I will try to keep contact with you and with the house , for what develops . Send that boy from the rancho to me as soon as he can come . I want to find out what he really knows and what he imagines . You understand everything ? Good ! I know you understand my trust . Hurry ! ? I am going to quiet the women and arm the men ? " He started through the gate . " Take every cartridge you have ! " he bellowed , over his shoulder , with the bell clanging . " See that you kill Apaches ? like you kill eagles ? " There were no Apaches to kill . There was nothing but the quietness with the horses tied in the scrub oak behind the ledge , with the seven men hidden in the  | rocks , with the guns and the loads ready . Martin stationed his vaqueros with care , in two groups for crossfire on the trail close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for his signal , and watched . They watched at first with an excitement , an impatience . In the long hours the impatience changed to boredom , and then to doubt . The sun moved up , stood high , and moved down changing the shapes of the shadows on the broken slope . The watchers tired their eyes , running them a thousand times , and then again , along the climbing sweep of the hillside and the drop into the canyon of Bavinuchi . Nothing moved . They listened , alert for firing in the distance , for nearer click or clatter , for voice or sign or clue . No sound came beyond the faint stir of wind along the rocks , the far call of a bird crying in the rise and fall of the stillness . There were no Apaches . The sun quickened over the bluffs westward . It plunged down reddening the sky , dimming the slope , the rocks , the ragged brush , the familiar twist of the trail , into twilight . Now they will come , Martin thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light is bad and the shooting is hard and they come jumping . Now is the time for Apaches . A chittering flock of parakeets whirred suddenly up the hillside , shaking the half-lit silence . In the still-lighted sky above , a flight of guacarnaya parrots made a wavering long file , two and two , mate and mate , then a single , then more mates , two and two , dark specks moving across the emptiness . There were no Apaches . In the early starlight vaqueros spoke low-voiced . " Those guacaynayas from down by the ocean , flying up to the sierra , going that far to eat pine nuts ! Mother of God , it appears reasonable to me . Me with nothing to eat since the supper my old lady made me last night , in former times ! " " The Apaches heard my bowel . It frightened them . That 's why they did n't come . They heard my bowel crying for a gorda . " " Listen , gorda . If you had Apaches today , you would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I remain with hunger , with hunger , man ! " " You think we will shoot these guns ? "  | " With all the bellywind blowing , it is not necessary ? " " Ssss , listen ! " From down the slope , hooves rattled in the stones . Martin stood up , trying to see . Close by , in the silence , a vaquero cocked a gun . Martin jerked around . " Uncock that ! Use your head , son , the sound comes from downtrail ? use your head ! " The sound climbed toward them . " Hei ! " It echoed in the rocks . " Who is it ? " " Santos ! And do n't thou shoot ! " There was a pause . " Hei , Martin ! " Martin moved down the rocks . He saw the shapes of the two horsemen in the trail . Santiago Santos put his gun away and leaned down from the saddle to shake Martin 's hand . " How does it go ? " " Quiet . Too quiet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carrying food . The women fixed it . You hungry ? " " We could eat . " The two men dismounted . In the quiet Martin heard their horses breathing from the climb . Domatilio carried a rawhide al f orja bulging from the pommel , and a water jug slung in straps . " Que tal , Champion , " Martin whispered . " Take it to the men up there . They 're gnawing sandals . " " And you ? " " After I talk to the patron . " Domatilio climbed the rocks with the food and water . Santiago Santos spit , and squatted on his hunkers , by the horses . Martin squatted beside him . " What you think , Martin ? " " I think I ought to ride to the rancho . And find out . Tonight . " " I have thought the same . But not you : Domatilio and I are prepared to go . " " And I with you . " " What about this post of men ? " " Pancho Silva can handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are leaving it , senor ? " " Teresa 's husband Antonio has it . He is capable . "  | " So is Pancho Silva . " " Urn . That boy from El Tabaco ? " Santiago Santos ' voice did not lower easily into a whisper ? " when he came riding in from pasture up there he says he saw something burning , he heard shots , he says he heard screaming , and he says he saw an Indian horseback . That is all we know . It is not enough . I am going up there to find out what we face . It may be nothing . It may be the Apache nation . " " Let me go , senor . If you prefer , let Domatilio go with me , but ? I hope you will stay down here to command the defense . " " Listen , nino . My people know what to do ! And I do n't send riders at night and stay home myself . " " In that case , patron , take two riders with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silva to me . I will talk to him . " Sitting in the rocks , Martin filled his belly with cold meat and tortillas . He ate three oranges and drank water and walked down into the scrub oak with his carbine and the cartridge bag . He loaded them on the saddle and untied Lagrimas and led him to the trail . " When we return you will know it , " Santiago Santos said to Pancho Silva . " At the top of that ridge up there we will fire three shots , pafpafpaf . Listen for it . Do n't be shooting at us when we come down that hill ! You understand everything ? " " Very well , patron . " " I leave it in your hand . " Santiago Santos mounted his horse . " Domatilio , you lead with your cat eyes in the dark . Martin , follow me . We stay bunched , close . " They moved out into the dark . As the three men rode , a taut peering watchfulness and acute care for sound seemed slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought and were like one , not three , climbing together with single intent through the shape of darkness , the sound of silence , into the sierra . They worked up the slopes into the trees , into the night chill of the mountain , easing their way along rough sidehill breaks away from the narrows of the trail . They stopped often to breathe their horses , and choose a way . Then they moved , breaking the quiet with the click and scuff of hooves , the squeak of leathers , the fink  | deleted page  | deleted page  | thought , but here it is fine fence along the weeds good weeds fine weeds . Plenty of time . Lower . Stay lower . Goddamn to these burrs . There . There it is . The Apaches came they really came they left the gate open . There is nothing in that corral . Nothing . If you can get in the cover of the trees there at the edge . Flat down this time . Flatter yet God it is a cold slime . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't hit a barn shaking this way . Do n't shake . Quit it . Those people are dead . Or gone . Dead or gone . Dead and gone . You have to quit shaking . Now . Up to that tree that fine tree if you can mash your nose against ? they did burn that shed you slept in . They burned it . They burned that house LOOK low by that wall . Listen to them . Gobbling . Gobbling what . Do something . Do what . Nor Christians alive he said . Poor Christians . Do something . All right . Go tell Santos his people are dead and the Apaches are gone and the wolves are here . Go tell him . At the corral he stood up and walked . He walked along the fence to where he thought he should turn , and he walked out through the grass with the rain tapping harder on his hat . He shook and he heard mixing with the rain the sound of the gobble snuffling snapping , the imagined sound , he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walking through the icy grass he looked into the blackness under the tree . He whistled . He whistled twice . " No Apaches , " Santiago Santos rasped at him . It was a statement , not a question . Martin 's teeth chattered . " They came . " " You got to the house ? " " Close enough . The house is burned , and that shed . The corral is empty . " " No people . " " The wolves are in front of the house . " Santiago Santos and the vaquero Domatilio brought their hands from their blankets and crossed themselves . " I did nothing about it . " " What could you do ? We wait until day . " Martin walked to Lagrimas . He was glad to see Lagrimas . The blanket at the cantle was soggy wet , but he untied it and wrapped it around himself , wiping mud from his numb hands . He leaned against the tree and waited for warmth .  | " The boy did n't make up anything . The orphan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Santiago Santos said . He went to his saddlebags and came back with a bottle . He uncorked it and handed it to Martin . " Mescal de pechuga . Then we will make cigarettes , and wait . " Martin felt the fire spread through him . It made his eyes water . " I am grateful , " he said . " Have another . " Martin had another . He and Domatilio spread their blankets over Santiago Santos as he squatted making three smokes , lighting them with his flint and steel , and the three men huddled near the horses by the great tree , cupping little fires in their hands , drawing the smoke in their lungs , feeling the warmth of their liquor , waiting in the rain for the night to end . The first gray came above the humped ridge . Through low murk the gray came late and it came slow . But it came . It touched at the black cup , building wraiths of coming form half tangled yet with unformed dark . Then the black cup filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in leaden pallor freed of night . Born into day , the three men looked at the gray rain , and they looked at each other , at the gray faces under the sagging hatbrims , at the gray light on the dripping blankets they held to their chins . They looked at the three horses standing humped with the wet cold , half asleep in the dim brush under the black branches of the oak . Santiago Santos ' voice came hoarse . " We can see plenty . " " And they can see plenty . " The vaquero Domatilio 's eyes were black slits in his wet face . " Cabrones , I put no trust in the cabrones , but I am ready . " " You , Martin ? Ready ? " " When you say . " " We ride with guns in our hands . If we get a welcome , we break for the trail straight to Paso del Aguila , and we stay together ? understand ? Angels of Christ , I am cold . And stiff . And old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the saddles , and they mounted , jerking with cold . Martin drew his  | pistol and with the soggy wad of handkerchief he pulled from his pocket , he wiped around the hammer , and checked the action . The three men rode up the stream bank , with the rain tapping , with the hooves sounding in the soaking high grass . They came to the corral . They looked at its gray emptiness , its open gate . Past the tumbled hayrick and the feed pen with its sagging lean-to , they rode around the trees , watching , feeling the rain in their hands on the gun handles . They saw the black hump of rubble where the shed had been . They came past a scorched tree . Beyond it stood the roofless walls in the rain , the window holes with the gray showing through , the gaping ruin of the door . The horses snorted in sudden veering panic . Reining , spurring in an arc wide of the ruin , the riders moved with their guns gripped , their eyes darting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trees . But their eyes saw most the gray ground with the stained lumps , the draggled rags , the noisome black-blooded scatter torn from cream-pale bones in the mud . Then around the corner of the charnel house they saw the two naked bodies gray on the rusted meat hooks by the gray wall , the whole bodies , hung head down on the tearing hooks , above the reach of wolves ' teeth , in the rain . The bodies of two children . Santiago Santos wrenched his horse around . He stopped dead still , staring into the grayness . " Infamy ! " he shouted at it . " Brutes ! Come out ! Fight me ! Fight me ! " The bawling anguish rolled out into the unechoing quiet . The rain tapped on the riders ' hats . Martin saw it was not rain on Santiago Santos ' face . The water came from the red-rimmed , honey-colored eyes . They looked straight at Martin . They moved on , and leveled at the vaquero Domatilio . " The cabrones have gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Martin ran his tongue over his dry front teeth , and turned Lagrimas with the hooves splashing in the mud . " You noticed ? " he said . " When we rode by ? " " Notice what ? Jesus Christ , those poor people ! " Martin got down stiff from the saddle . He handed the ramal to Domatilio , and walked toward the gray walls , clamping his jaws ,  | hating to breathe . He picked up a muddy rifle from the ground . With the barrel he prodded at a wet , torn lump , feeling his gorge rise . When he had prodded enough , he reached down and took hold of the peak-toe on the moccasin , and pulled . A part of the knee-length rawhide legging came with it . He found another rifle , and picked it up . The horses shied when he came close with the things in his hand . He dropped them in the mud , and walked on , to another scatter near a tree . He came back to the horses with another rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and looked up at Domatilio . " The scalps are over there yet . If that knife on your arm itches ? " The vaquero 's teeth showed like gray fangs in the curly black whiskers . Martin turned to Santiago Santos . " What guns did your people have ? " " They had a French musket . A thing from the time of Maximilian . " Martin got on his horse . " It was a lot of musket . " Santiago Santos shook his head , frowning , grinding his teeth . " We see what else they had . " The three horsemen rode wide around the ruin , cutting for sign , finding no sign readable in the rain-whipped mud . Then under the trees fifty yards from the walls they found a dead Apache pinned under a dead horse . They found two more dead Apaches , and a dead pony with rawhide shoes . The bodies were all on the south side of the walls . " The Apaches left their dead , " Martin said . " They left their dead on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left going south , and they left running ? " " Who chased them , Jesits Maria , your Chihuahueno again ? My people did n't chase them . My people are up there at the walls . " " As for the Chihuahueno , he is not mine . Neither have we seen his Remington .44s in this mud . But : Apaches do n't leave their dead . " " Neither do Christians , " Santiago Santos growled . He looked toward the walls in the rain .  | deleted page  | him , slow . The hooves scraped approaching in the murmur of the rain . Martin saw the black face under the black hat , he saw the two black letters on the canteen at the black pommel , US . The horseman reined , pointing the Springfield . " Soldados ? " he jerked his chin toward the rim of the rise ? " fight Apache ! " The teeth showed snarling white , and the tongue showed red , in the wet , black face . " Kill Apache ! Savve ? No speak espanyol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lord God Jesus ! " " Will you lower that .45 ? 70 ? " " You ai n't Mex ! " " No . " " You would n't try to lay no trouble for soldiers , would you ? " " Ca n't you see my hands ? I 'm friend ? will you lower that gun ? " The Springfield lowered . Martin stooped and picked up the machete . He walked to Lagrimas , slid the knife in its sheath , and climbed into the saddle . The trooper 's eyes were fastened on him . " What you doing , this goddam country , white man ? " " I work here . " " Heil " The shout came sharp , from the trees by the ruin . " Martin ! Who is it ? " The trooper jerked his gun around . " Who that ? What he say ? " " My boss down there ? trying to bury his dead ? keep your gun off ! " Martin cupped his hands and called , " Friends ! All well , Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Santiago Santos shouted again . " Soldiers ! " No answer came . Martin saw the shambling file appear at the rim of the rise . He saw the slumped horsemen , the makeshift litter hitched between the two mules , the men on foot , the pack animals , slow in the rain . He heard a blurred command , and he saw the carbines unslung . " Tell your officer , soldier , " Martin said . " Three of us alive at the rancho , all friendly ! " Facing the dark file along the rise , the trooper held up his arm . The file was halted . The trooper turned to Martin . " Tell them  | deleted page  | deleted page  | " Did you git Magues ? " " No , goddammit . We killed all but him and two or three others that made the break when we flanked them . He got away . But he ai n't looking for trouble about now . He had his trouble .

" Martin turned to the trooper . " How did you catch them ? " " They caught us ! When the sun raised yestiddy morning our goddam Teewer Indian scouts was acting queer and bolted off , skeered . The Apaches shot down into us sudden ? the first volley give us hell in a black basket ! Then we rallied . Both sides firing from cover . My Lieutenant Scanlon , he finely led eight of us crawling clean up high around the hill . Took till almost noon . Crawling . We smoked them out ! Them we did n't hit , had to move , and they moved jumping for their horses , and the main body cut them when they jumped . We put the blue fire in them dirty docks ! Finely . That major like a crazy man leading us fortyfour thousand miles . We finely done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ? My Lieutenant Scanlon , dead . Contract surgeon , dead . Packer Boggs and his two men , dead . Nine of my good niggers , dead ! All buried mighty shallah . In this goddam country . The four Teewer scouts , all dead , what knew the trails or said they did ? I think my own niggers killed them for boging . Nobody now to tell you where you is and is you going the right way . Nobody now to speak the Spic so 's you can trust it . Short of mounts , and what we still got , unfit for the duty ! My three wounded niggers . And the major in a litter , shot in the side , still like a crazy man . I druther be in hell with my back broke than gitting my L Troop outn this , back to God 's natural country ! How far are we from the You Ess ? " " A long way . You the sergeant ? " " Tobe Sutton , first sergeant , L Troop , Second Battalion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Major Colton is in that litter . " " How you know that ? "  | " I was in Puerto . Maybe the major will remember me . " " My Christ , let 's go see ! What is your name , suh ? " " Brady . Before we go , let me tell Senor Santos here . " " Tell him . Bring him and the cowboy along . " " Don Santiago . This is the sergeant . There was a bad battle , about five miles south , yesterday in the morning . The Apaches are destroyed , but the troop is hurt . It moves now for the United States ? with only one officer alive . He happens to be a Chief of Battalion and commander of the fort at Puerto , Texas , and I know him ! He is wounded and they carry him in a litter . He wants to see us . " Santiago Santos abruptly held out his hand to the black sergeant . The sergeant looked surprised . He shook the hand . " Santiago Santos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No speak espanyol . Tell him , Mr. Brady , I thank him . " Santiago Santos turned to Domatilio . " Bring our horses ! We ride to the commander . ? Martin , ask the sergeant where the cavalry first encountered these Indians . " " He wants to know where you first jumped the Indians . " " This time , at the foot of the Hatchet Mountains , right near the Mexico line . When we come south at Pulpito Pass the Indian sign forked . The major split our force . He brought Scanlon with L Troop and the packers and the four scouts after this Magues bunch . Cap 'm Stoker took H and K and a company of Cheericow scouts east of Pulpito after Fuego 's main band . G Troop made supply camp at Pulpito . They are guarding the wagons there . Goddam I would like to see them ! " " Don Santiago , he says they trailed these Apaches from near the boundary . " " Forty leagues ! They had permission from the State of Sonora ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that word ! They all ask it . Tell him we got permiso . I wish to Christ we did n't , but we do . It says : pursuit on a trail , and not more than one hundred miles below the line . ' " " They have the permission . Completely official . " " What did he say of Pulpito ? " " The army wagons are camped there , waiting for the troop . "  | " The Pulpito is thirty leagues from here . " " Sergeant . Don Santiago says you are about ninety miles south of Pulpito . The line is thirty or forty miles north of there . " " Jesus loves me , " the sergeant said . They got on their horses and rode into the trees . Beyond a guard detail standing with carbines unslung , rain-darkened horses and pack mules stood with sagging heads along a picket line stretched between two pines . Gray smoke boiled thick from campfires of wet wood . Troopers in their sodden brown canvas fatigues and drooped black hats hunched over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boil coffee , slicing pale salted sowbelly into a few blackened pans . Beyond them , a tarpaulin was thrown over the low branch of an oak and fastened slanting to pegs in the mud . Under its sloped shelter a few men stooped and sat around a litter made of pine poles and a blanket , propped up from the mud by piles of stones . " Here are the people , sir , " the sergeant said , leading Martin and Santiago Santos toward the shelter , away from Domatilio who stood holding the horses , shivering , alone under a tree . The rain patted on the oily canvas and rolled along it in little winding streams . A trooper with bandaged head and a trooper with an arm in a stained sling moved aside . Martin looked down at the face of the man lying on the litter . The face was thinner . It was not red now : it was pale . The whiskers were not dusty : they were wet . In the dimmed light under the canvas , the eyes in the pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The black horse broke your leg . You were lying in the street . " " I was ? and you told them to get me a doctor ? " " I have forgotten your name . " " Brady . " " I am Major Colton . " " Major , this here is the man I work for , Don Santiago Santos . He owns the fine hacienda of Bavinuchi . This rancho is his , and most of the country around here . And you wo n't find a better man . " " Is that so ? " Colton 's eyes looked up apprizing the figure in dripping rough leather .  | " Don Santiago , " Martin said . " Quiero presentar , como amigo , el Senor Comandante Colton . " Santiago Santos reached down offering his hand . " Buenas dias mucha gusta , " Colton said . " El gusto es mio , Senor Comandante ? " " Tell him I do n't speak it , Brady . " Colton spoke with his jaws clamped shut . " He has no Spanish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christ , I thought he would be black , Martin ! I want to thank him for his vengeance on the brutes who killed my people . Tell him I am grateful ! Ask him of his wound . He is in pain ! " " Don Santiago is grateful to you for killing Apaches . He wants to know , are you hurt bad ? " " Certainly not ! The wound started bleeding again , jerking in this litter . I have ordered a halt until this blood stops ? " He pulled back the blanket and stared at the red splotch on the binding around his waist . It smelled of carbolic acid . " Just under the ribs on the left side ? the ball traveled through and came out clean in back . I ca n't think the bowel is punctured . But ? I lost my surgeon ? in the first volley ? " " He ca n't travel with that , " Santiago Santos said . " He is my guest . Offer him my house . Tell him I will also care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . Tell him ! Let them carry him to Bavinuchi ! " " Don Santiago says you are his guest . He offers you his house in Bavinuchi . He wants to quarter your men too , and put your stock in shape while you get well . " " I have heard of the Latin punctilio , " Colton said , after a silence . " It does n't mean what it says . " " Let me tell you something . Get it straight . This man means just what he says . He is trying to help . He is a damn fine man and he can help plenty ! " Colton looked up . His eyes moved to Santiago Santos ' face and back to Martin 's . " Thank him . I am leading troops to base . Without malingering or delay . As soon as this bleeding stops , we will push on . "  | " He thanks you . He says he is leading troops to base without ? delay . He will move as soon as his bleeding stops . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is his affair . Does the troop have a surgeon ? " " He was killed in the battle . " " Tell the commander I regret he will not accept my very poor hospitality . Tell him at least Domatilio can help the wound . He can find cobwebs . He can find nopal . " " Don Santiago is sorry you wo n't stay and get well . He says before you go he would like to have his cowboy gather some spider web to put on the wound . That will stop the bleeding , Major . We use it down here . Don Santiago would also like to fix you a poultice of a cooked cactus leaf to put under that binding . It draws out the matter . It would help you . " " I do n't think we need any primitive remedies , thank you . We have the surgeon 's chest . Carbolic acid seems to deaden the pain somewhat . Mainly , I believe my use of a litter is all wrong : it is not only slow , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ride horseback . I intend to do that ? " Colton sat up abruptly , gripping the pine poles of the litter . " ? Get moving . These troopers of mine are hurt too . ? Does the senor have any corn here for stock feed ? And does he have any hard liquor to use for medicine ? " " Don Santiago , he does not want the cobweb or the nopal . But he wants to know if you have any corn for his stock . And if you have any strong drink , as medicine . " " Tell him to send men to the feed pen and to take all the corn they find . As for drink ? a pity there is so little in the saddlebag ! " He moved out of the shelter , toward where Domatilio waited with the horses . " He says for your men to take all the corn they can find , down there at the feed pen . " " I expect to pay for it , " Colton said . Martin said nothing . Colton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north of here , to the Pulpito Pass ? " " Only as far as Techapic . " " How far is that ? "  | " Maybe thirty miles . " " You do n't know it farther on . " " I am new to this side of the sierra , but ? " " I may as well mention my situation . My four Tewa trailers are dead ? and Boggs , the packer , who spoke Spanish and knew something of this general area . I had hoped to get from you some dependable information as to the most direct march back to the Pulpito . " Santiago Santos came under the tarpaulin . He carried a bottle . He put it in Colton 's hand . " Gracias , " the major said . " Cuanto ? " " Eh ? " Santiago Santos asked Martin . " What ? Tell him I am sorry there is not more . All he wants awaits him at Bavinuchi . " " That is all the liquor he has here , Major . He is sorry there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What is this stuff ? " " Mescal . " " Villainous ! " Colton looked up . " Cuanto ? " he repeated . " How much ? And for the corn ? " Martin hesitated . " He is wanting to pay you , Don Santiago ? and for the corn . " " Tell him , " Santiago Santos said . His voice was very dry . " It is a gift . Gift . Martin , thou comest from very strange people . " " What ? " Colton asked . " He do n't want pay for anything . No pay . But you could lend him shovels , if you carry any . So he could bury his dead people ? " " Sergeant Sutton ! Order out two details . One to gather the corn you find at that pen by the house . The other with spades to dig graves . Get them moving ! " " Yes suh ! " The sergeant glanced at Martin , and started away . " Don Santiago , " Martin said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And men to dig graves ? " The tawny eyes turned at the major . " Good . Very good . " " He better tell the sergeant what he wants done , " Colton said . " Perhaps you will go with him . When you return would you both share my mess ? Not much ? but at least the stump-water coffee will be hot . I will see it 's hot ! "  | " Thank you , Major . " Martin turned to Santiago Santos . " We ought to go with the sergeant . " They walked out of the shelter , to the tree where Domatilio stood alone with the horses . " Don Santiago , " Martin said . " One thing is clear to me . These people ought not to be in Mexico . " " Nothing could be clearer . " Santiago Santos started to mount his horse . " Don Santiago . Wait ? If that major will not stay to receive your help , I ought to go with him to give him mine . " " That major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I saw that sergeant ? he is about to have more than he can manage . I feel it , it is strange , I feel it . I ought to go ? " " Man ! You mean you would leave us ? Leave Bavinuchi ? " " Senor , believe me . These times at Bavinuchi ? I want you to understand me ? but these people ? from my own country , in trouble ? you see it ! " " Listen to me , Martin . Something I would not say . But I say it now . I think of you like a part of ? of Bavinuchi . I will tell you : like a son , like Andres , like Agustin ! " Martin looked down , at the muddy hooves of Lagrimas in the wet pine needles . " There is something I have said all my life in Mexico : I say it to you for the first time from here , from my heart : I am at your orders . Do you want me to stay ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they looked in Martin 's face . " No . We once said , A man should live where he belongs . ' A man has to decide . " They got on their horses and rode toward the gray walls .  | CHAPTER XXII BY DISCIPLINED effort of will , Colton gripped at the big pommel of Martin 's Mexican saddle , grasping it with both his desperate hands . He held on , rocking in the twist of the pain , the fevered weakness , feeling the spring of the driving sinew under him , surrendering the urgency of his pain , his weakness , to the pace of the horse Lagrimas carrying him north , north where at last the familiar line of the mountain was the shape of his hope . Sitting an issue saddle on a tough dun cavalry jade , Martin rode using his spurs , jolting at Colton 's side . He rode watching Colton 's gripping hands . Behind them a squad of troopers and a pack mule hammered a punishing trot unequal to the pace of the black stallion 's swinging rack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might , Martin thought , carefully keeping his eyes from Colton 's gray rigid face , he might . I never believed it . But he be- lieved it . Maybe he can:He might after all . He asked for this ? he would not stay in that wagon at the Pulpito ; he pulled his rank , he said he could make it . He said he had to make it . And now he might . By God he might . I hope he will . Watching the hands grip , Martin felt his mind pull tight , like a rope , a rope frayed against the unrelenting edge of Colton 's agony . I wonder if I will , Martin thought . I wonder if we meet the big gray hats along this road , the red chin strings and the Remingtons ? and him riding my horse ? before we cross the river . " Looks familiar ? up there ? " Colton forced the words from his dry mouth , and turned his head . " The spring of Samalayuca is at the edge of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We will make it , Major . This is the stage road now . " The westering winter sun cut steely lights on the stone of the mountains in the north , on the hazed shapes at the far side of the emptiness , at the pass where Puerto stood . Long shadow slanted from the dry December skeletons of mesquite , from the moving legs of the horses . The hooves touched quiet in the emptiness . " Brady ? " Colton said . Martin saw . He knew it suddenly and it tore his heart . " Hu Lagrimas , " Martin said . He swung off the dun horse fast , and came around , to the rein by Lagrimas ' jaw . He reached up with his other hand trying to hold Colton on the saddle . " Tobe ! " Martin called . Lagrimas jerked and Martin almost lost his hold . Sergeant Sutton sprang from his horse to Martin 's side . " Ease him , " Martin said . His voice came hoarse . " Foot ? out of stirrup ? there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were a child . Jumping down from their blowing horses , the other troopers came . Martin handed Lagrimas ' reins to one of them . Their eyes rolled , yellow in their black faces , in the sunset light . Martin kneeled by Tobe Sutton , over the figure on the sand . " Get him water , " Martin said . He untied the dirty handkerchief from Colton 's neck . When the trooper came with the canteen , Martin wet the handkerchief and bathed the stiff , dusty face . Colton 's eyes opened . They looked up , at the black men , at the black horse , against the yellow sky .  | " Hopeless , " Colton said . The word came through the clenched jaw . " I ca n't hold on . Here ? " he fumbled at his finger , at the gold ring with the scratched stone , the worn spread eagles and the numerals ' 61 . " Sergeant . The ring goes to my wife ? Mrs. Colton ? take it . " The effort of lifting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the finger . " It is ? important , " Colton said . With the resolute effort of will that had sustained him horseback six days and two hundred miles bleeding inside with a bullet hole at the edge of his spleen , bleeding slowly to his death , he tried to finish what he had to say in his loneliness . He tried to finish his life . " Tell Mrs. Colton this was the training , to wear it . Ellen ! In Long Gray Line we follow , close order , where ? " Colton labored at his fading thought , trying to lick his lips . Martin wiped them with the wet handkerchief , and waited . " Thank you , " Colton said , very clearly . " Seven bad months in the field but ? when I found the enemy , I engaged him ? " The jaws came suddenly open . It was intolerably quiet . Tobe Sutton looked at the gold ring in the dirty palm of his hand , and he stood up , and looked at his troopers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I be goddam if you did n't . " " We ai n't going to leave him , " a trooper said , half asking . His rusty hat was in his hands . " We are going to take him home , " Martin Brady said . It was biting cold , in the faint light of first stars and a new sickle moon in the west , when Colton 's body was wrapped tight in canvas from the mule 's pack , and lashed over the back of the tough dun , ready . " I liked the major , finely ? " said Tobe Sutton . " I will lead him . " Martin went to Lagrimas and reset the stirrups , letting out the leathers to fit himself again . When he climbed into his saddle , he felt the good familiar seat , the good familiar response from the ramal . He patted the slick hide on the warmth beneath the tangled mane ; he had to whisper to Lagrimas , privately , in his own tongue , " Thou art horse ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trooper . When it  | was fixed , the sergeant leaned from his saddle and took the end of the rope in his hand . " Forr 'd ? " he called . He led off , with Martin and the troopers and the limping pack mule in a silent file behind the dun horse and the burden . They rode the pale mark of the stage road around the mounded dunes to the seep of Samalayuca in the dark . The moon was down when the stock stood drinking at the stagnant pool . The troopers eased themselves , standing with the reins , stamping their numb feet , blowing their numb hands . They used words , in a kind of shorthand of comradeship . " By morning , this tank gon na be stone froze ? " " My Jesus I 'm stone froze now . " " This nigger is starving to death . " " Naw he ai n't . He done et . Lass year over at Sonory . " " He alive , ai n't he ? More than some ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't want it . " " Howbout barrack talk ? This time tomorrow : Tattoo ? " " Joobus but I likes to hear the nigger talk that . Talk it ! " " Talk 's cheap , takes money to buy the whiskey ? " Martin drew the sergeant away from the voices . " Tobe . This is no place to be . We can cut northeast off the road and hit the river in twenty miles . We can be in the States by midnight . " " Mr. Brady , if these public animals ' breaks down now , we 'll walk , and if we ca n't walk , we 'll crawl . " " One thing ? " Martin said , " we do n't want no Mexican patrols on us ! If we move straight across from here , we will come out below Ramblazo on the river . On the other side , the men can build a fire . And eat . And get to Fort Jefflin in the morning . " " God 's natural country , Mr. Brady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was later than midnight when they came around the foot of the hills and felt the slope that tilted eastward into the open , into the valley . The sand was deep and the gullies were rough . The gaunted animals toiled , weak in the legs , stumbling often ; the riders sat their saddles , aching in the frosty cold . Slowly , under the winking high stars , they came to where they saw beyond the paleness of the sand the darkness of the brush that lined the river , and they rode toward it . They worked across a  | dry flat of alkali white in the starlight , with the hooves scuffling the crust in the windless silence . They filed along blurred thickets with thorny arms of tornillo snagging , scraping at the canvas on the dun horse 's back . They moved through the brush to the bank of the river , to the edge of Mexico . Martin rode to the wet lip of the stream dark in the sandy bed . " I 'm trying it first , " he rasped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look bad ? " Lagrimas stepped in , snuffling , grudging the faint tap of the spur . The bitter cold flow splashed with each deepening step . It came eddying to the stirrups and Martin lifted his boots . Then it shallowed fast . The wet hooves stepped out climbing dry sand to where salt cedars grew . Martin 's heart pounded when he reined on solid ground . It seemed no different . It looked the same , it smelled the same , it was just as cold , just as dark . But his heart pounded . He turned to watch the troopers . They crossed churning , quick . He saw the dark shape on the dun horse joggle in the splashing . It came moving up the bank behind Tobe Sutton , who looked back , beyond the horse he led , beyond the black water . " I wish , " he said , to nobody , from deep in his throat , " we never have to go over that river no more . " " I looked over Jordan , " a trooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We will ride up in the bosky , " Tobe Sutton said . They made a rough camp by a fire they built of rotten cottonwood dragged into a pile . Colton 's bent body was stiff , and the canvas was wet , when Martin and the sergeant unlashed it , and lifted it from the worn dun 's back , and laid it on the ground at the edge of the firelight . The shaking tired troopers set a picket line , and unsaddled , and took the pack from the lame mule , and hung the nose bags on . Martin tethered his stallion away from the horses ; he poured all the corn he had into the frayed morral before he fastened it on the black nose . Warming themselves , too tired and too cold to care about the telltale brightness of the curling gold flame , they drank scalding coffee and ate hardtack and sowbelly the mule had packed from the G Troop wagon a long way back , a long , long way back , at Pulpito.  | Tobe Sutton looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You niggers : rest on your arms . I 'll stand a guard for you ? me and Mr. Brady , we stands your guard ? while you catches a nod till day . " Sitting close by the red coals , Martin shaded his face from the bite of the heat , feeling the scorch on his shins , on the front of his shirt . His outstretched fingers pulsed tingling . His nose ran and his eyes watered with the warmth . It merged with his weariness to make him dizzy . " Tobe . If I fall to sleep , pull me out of the fire . " " I feel a little bit noddy myself but ? I 'm too spunked now to shut my eyes . I could of kissed this old ground . Old Texas ground ! " " Tell me something , Tobe . You heard what the major said : Long Gray Line . ' What did he mean ? I thought he was a Union man . " " Course he was ! He fought to free us niggers . You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my time ! Major meant about the West Point . Where the rank goes to learn . They wear gray going to school . " " Oh , " Martin said . " Lots of pride in that school , for white gentlemen . " " You finally liked the major , you said . " " Mr. Brady , this afternoon look to me like I found out why Colton take us chousing all over the creation looking for Indians to fight . You see , the battalion commander before him at Jefflin did n't take to no battling . And it finely come to Bear Canyon . The bullets flew so thick he like the boy that caught the yellow jacket and let it go again glad to git out of it . He stay off on a nice hill giving orders where it take a Gatling gun to touch him . He think his hair is too good to be lost . Old Fuego run off our horses and would of cut us all to pieces if Cap 'm Stoker lucky had n't come shooting about that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got relieved after that one . He was a dissgrace to the Tenth , and then here come Colton . Everybody think Cap 'm Stoker was in line for the command . But here come Colton . From the Division Headquarters , one of them gilt-edged detail boys . This evening when he try to talk before he die , I got the  | idy . He just been trying to prove he was all right . He want the West Point to know he was all right ? and he sure want his wife to know . " " I do n't see how he lived ? or rode a mile , Tobe . Last night when I helped him his belly was swelled hard as stone . Stone ! Then today , when we got so near ? I thought he was going to make it . He kept saying he was going to make it . " " He try to see his wife , before he die . Lord ? " Tobe Sutton checked himself . " Mr. Brady , you ever see the major 's wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad I do n't have to see her tomorrow . With that ring . " " Will you go with me when I takes that ring ? I druther butt my brain on a stooping post oak ? Mr. Brady , you got to help me ! " " We better get there first . " Light came with coyotes crying , and the cold sky hard and clean . When the troopers had been roused , and the horses with their breaths smoking were saddled , and the bent canvas bundle was tied stiff on the dun again , and the hitch was trim on the mule 's back , the horsemen mounted , springing their achy knees , cursing . As they moved to the river , to water , Lagrimas shied at the sudden racket of mallards rising noisy from the marsh at the edge of the tamarisk . Martin looked north . Beyond dark bobbling dots of duck and honker V 's in the lighting sky , pink sunrays touched the top of Mount Jefflin . The hoarfrost was melting on the low ground beneath the salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the horsemen crossed a dry acequia and came to the first cornfield of Ramblazo . Skirting the lines of broken yellow stubble , they rode with the climbing sun straight in their faces , to the sandhills rimming the valley 's eastern edge . A haze dimmed the tall trees over the nestled settlement ; the tang of mesquite smoke and burning leaves hung faintly acrid in the pale sunlit air . It warmed as the file of riders moved jogging around the bare fields , past vineyards with each cut vine mounded in its brown cone of loam for the winter , by lanes of leafless tall poplars , to where they entered again the ruts of the road north , to Puerto . Tobe Sutton put his draggled , weary detail to a trot .  | Martin saw the buggy coming . Dust boiled from under the wheels and drifted thinning up into the branches , the brown leaves , the clumps of green mistletoe , on the arching cottonwoods over the road . There was something about the angle of the buggy driver 's hat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trotting file . The driver was waving , long before Martin reined and jumped from his saddle , at the side of the road . " Doc ! How are you ? " Doctor Stovall had the cigar from his mouth , grinning . He was holding out his hand . The sun cast a crooked shadow beside his broken nose , on his long upper lip . " I knew that black before you started to run ! How in hell are you ? That leg ! That stud horse ! By God ! " " Doc , I am glad to see you ! You well ? " " Out saving lives . This is my day at Ramblazo ? what 're the troops ? " " Tobe ! " Martin called . The sergeant pulled his file off the road , and halted . He dismounted and came to Martin 's side . " Doc , this is Sergeant Tobe Sutton . I been camping with him and his army since the big mountains of Sonora . Tobe ? this is the best damn doctor there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We been needing a doctor ? " " What you been up to ? Scouting Cocomonga wine from officers ' mess , and working Brady over ? " " We pretty near made him a trooper , at that ? " Stovall put his cigar in his mouth , and pointed at the dun horse . " I did n't see that ! What do you have there ? " Tobe Sutton looked at Martin , to let him answer . " Doc . That is the body of Major Starke Colton . " " No ! " " Yes it is . He had a damn tough fight with Apaches . He come close to wiping out Magues ' whole band . Down in the Sierra Madre . Colton got a ball in his side . He tried to get home and he near made it , riding horseback ? two hundred miles ! He died just below Samalayuca yesterday evening . " Stovall was obviously moved . He looked down the road , saying nothing .  | " Well Doc ? I did n't know you were such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man . " " It 's pretty bad , I know , carrying him doubled over like this , into the post . And when he almost made it . Bringing him to his wife , without warning ? " " You are not bringing him to his wife . " " What ? " " His wife is dead . They found Mrs. Colton last week , drowned . At the dam in the river , there below JefHin . " " Drowned ? How ? " " She apparently committed suicide . I was called for the inquest . There was no surgeon at the post . " Tobe Sutton looked at Martin , then at the doctor . " My Jesus . That pretty woman ? And this ring now , I was taking her this ring , Doctor . " Stovall looked away . He pulled a match from his pocket and tried to light his cigar . " The way things go , " he said . " Doctor , is there any troops at the post ? " " The adjutant , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guess Stoker will get the command now . " " Colton was all right , Doctor suh . " " Who said anything about that ? Of course he was all right . " Martin looked toward the dun horse . " We better go on . This sun , it 's ? " You 're correct , Brady , " Stovall said . " When you get through , why do n't you come by , and stay with me in town ? I would like to hear the story , my friend . " " I 'm much obliged , Doc , inviting me . Say ? how is that Kentucky mare ? I see you are not driving her . " " Madie 's fine ? her colt 's due along in March . She 's getting shod this morning , and I borrowed a horse . " " Is n't this Wakefield 's old bay ? " " You remember a horse , do n't you ? " " Maybe better than a man , sometimes . But how is old Wake-field ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable . Brady , you wo n't recognize Puerto . Oil your gun well before you arrive . The C. &; S. grading crews are this side of Charco now ! Puerto is a god- dam lot of honkytonk , hardly room to walk in the streets . If you do n't want to sleep on the ground , bunk at my place . " " I have slept on lots of ground , Doc . But I would sure like to take you up . I expect you 'd like to see me with some of the ground washed off , before I walk in . " The corners of Stovall 's mouth lifted , creasing wrinkles at the corners of his sharp eyes . " Hell . Glad to see you back on this side . "  | BIG WET FLAKES tumbled thick from the night sky . The snowy streets of Puerto were queerly neat and quiet in their luminous shroud . " Reminds me of Missouri , " Martin said . His toes were numb and his boots crunched as he stepped . " Reminds me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the fall of the silent flakes . " Damned if it do n't make Puerto nearly pretty . " They turned a corner and walked another block in the muffled  | strangeness of the whirling snow . A crack of light glowed along the sides of the drawn curtain in Doctor Stovall 's front window ; Wakefield rapped his big chapped knuckles on the doctor 's door , and it opened . Yellow lamplight made a golden swarm of the snowflakes . " Come in ! " P. J. Ruelle , the mining man , greeted them . " You froze ? " " Cold as a welldigger 's butt , " Wakefield said , knocking snow from his hat . " Where 's the doc ? " " Somebody come for him . He said he would be right back . You git up to the fire while I fix you both a little hot priming toddy . Doctor 's orders ! " Martin stood by Wakefield warming at the hearth . The pleasant room smelled of mesquite smoke , and the drugs of the doctor 's pharmacy cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the toddy glasses . He added steaming water from a pitcher on the table , and stirred the sugar with a spoon . " Shine the light ! " Wakefield said as they lifted their glasses together . " I guess we would have missed this party if Mart had n't whipped the empty wagons down the road while I augured with the gotdummed purchase agent . We took four hundred bushels of corn and three wagonloads of hay to that gang up there ? they must have a couple hundred head of mules dragging scrapers on those fills . " " Where are the tracks now ? " " Coming ! The other side of my old Cottonwood Station . " " Brady , " Ruelle said , " did you git your reward money from Sheriff Mathews yet ? He told me this afternoon that he got it for you , in the mail from Silverton . " " I got it . That 's why we 're late . I am sure obliged to you and to Wakefield , and the sheriff . " The front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was caked on his hat , on his long buffalo coat , on the top of the scarred satchel in his gloved hand . " Toddy for you ! " Ruelle called . Stovall hung the hat and coat on the rack by the door , by his guests ' pistol belts . " Why did n't you help yourselves to cigars ? " He walked to the mantel and took one from the box .  | " Doc . We appreciate your having us for a feed . I am damn tired of my own fried grits . " " I thought us sorry singles ought out of trouble with saloonkeepers , pimps and newcomers ? " He took the toddy from Ruelle . " Thank you , Pete . Here 's how ? " " Any trouble over there on the street ? Is that where you been ? " " No trouble . Just delirium tremens and pneumonia in the barrel shed of the Acme Saloon . His mother would scarcely have known him . " Stovall drained his glass . " Well . He would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what our departed friend Travis Hight used to call the coming of civiliz-ation . ' Let 's fix another drink all around . " " I hear Judge Heffridge came back . " " Got back before Christmas , while you and Brady were up in Charco . He brought two additions to the town . Capitalists ' the Judge calls them , from up north somewhere , Illinois or Indiana . Good strong Republicans like the Judge . They are going to get a charter for a National Bank and buy up town lots and start a lumberyard and take over what the Judge calls the development of a great frontier . ' " " When Heffridge got whipped at the polls , he just moved out of office into taller grass ! " " After the big shooting . I figured the judge might not come back to Puerto . " " Why not ? The bitterness against Heffridge died with Travis Hight . It 's a different bunch now . " " A roody bunch . What 's the matter , Mart ? Old age got you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper hand of him . " " He done the town a big last favor when he killed Gus Heffridge and that sorry Horse McFeeters ! And if he 'd been a fraction faster whipping around at Horse ? " " Travis Hight would be dead anyway . The judge would see to that . " " I saw Gus Heffridge once , " Martin said . " Recall that time , Mr. Ruelle ? It reminds me of the newspaper man . I forget his name . What happened to him ? " ' it  | The doctor 's eyes glanced quickly in Martin 's face . Martin noticed it . " After the elections , " the doctor said , " that Republican newspaper was a lost cause . Then the shooting match of Heffridge and McFeeters against Hight finished off what was left of the Puerto Eagle . Naylor left town . " " Tell you one thing , Brady , " Ruelle said , winking , " that Naylor took lots of buggy rides with the army woman they found behind the dam . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Tutt talking . " The doctor 's gray-headed Mexican cook opened the door from the dining room . " Lista , " she said . " I guess our goose is cooked . Drink up , and we 'll eat . " " Where 'd you shoot the bird , Doc ? " " The slew behind the McBee place . While I was down there I got some bottles of Don Santiago 's red wine . It might be a little sweet for Burgundy , but it 's still pretty good with a goose for New Year . " " How is old Santiago McBee ? " " Not so strong for civiliz-ation . He used to own all the land this town is built on . Now all he has is the old house in the grapevines . He 's still telling the stories about how he ground corn in his mill for Alexander Doniphan , and how he gave a banquet in his house for Benito Juarez ? who would n't cross the river to the party . Let 's eat . " " Some spread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to belong in Puerto . It was set with a white tablecloth and china , silver and wineglasses , with smoking plates of plenty by the brown roast goose . " Sons ? " Wakefield said when the doctor finished carving , " bless the meat and damn the skin , throw back your ears and all pitch in . " " We got a parson in Puerto now . Be careful . " " Just sing me Pull for the Shore ' while I git outside this goose ! " The four men ate . Contrary to their desire and their expectation , vague as shadow in the corners of the room , a constraint  | compounded in their separate thoughts came touching around the table . The old cook brought hot biscuits and gravy ; the doctor poured wine ; for dessert there were holiday bun " uelos dusted with sugar and cinnamon ; yet the feast never mellowed to festivity . " Brady , " said the doctor , " I saw Ernest Mathews . How does it feel to have a hundred dollars gold in your pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should be glad to have the money . And it bothered him . Suddenly he understood : it was the wry , heavier weight of the buckskin purse on his leg the day he walked to Senor Roa 's . Remembering it , Martin took a drink of the wine . Lamplight caught in the wineglass making a shining spot red as blood . " You going to buy a town lot and get rich ? " " Well , " Martin said , " I owe a fellow in Del Norte fifty pesos . And I 'm going to buy my nigger sergeant Tobe a bottle of gin for New Year 's . He 's coming by the stable tomorrow . And I think I 'll get me a new saddle blanket and some boots with thick soles and a new hat and stand treats for you all . " " Mart , you wo n't never be rich . You 'll be like me . " " You know ? " Martin spoke trying to put vague shadow into words , turning the stem of the wineglass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The way things go . For instance , if Mr. Ruelle had n't seen me that night by the tent saloon . If Mr. Hight had n't told me , down there in Chihuahua , how it was . And if ? well , I would be on the other side somewhere tonight . Eating tortillas if I was lucky . Instead of goose . I guess I ought to feel rich , right now ? " " Brady ? " the doctor left it unfinished . Instead , he looked at his watch . " Right now , the old year has ten minutes to go and the old Puerto goes with it . The Puerto I came to . Right now , I get a fairly clear whiff of the odor of mortality . " " I ca n't smell it from here , Doc , " Wakefield finally said , " but I can hear it . " The sound came to them , across the distance of the snowmuffled air from Puerto Street . " Hell . If we 're not going to hoot , or holler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned , " shall we drink ? Here 's to tomorrow : do n't look back . "  | " Happy New Year . " " I believe the Honorable Joseph Wakefield , proprietor , Star Livery Stable , will now rap out a ditty . " " Clear the gate , boys ? Little black bull come down the mountain , Hoorah Johnny and a hoorah Johnny ? Join in , gents ? A long time ago , A long time ago . He run his horn in a white oak sapling , Hoorah Johnny and a hoorah Johnny , A long time ? " They heard the loud knock , and followed the doctor into the parlor as he went to the door . " Come in , " the doctor called . A gaunt-faced stranger stood holding his hat . " Doctor ? " he asked . Stovall nodded . " The Diamond G has burnt . A couple of the whores has been crippled in the stompede . Can you come ? " " Yes , " Stovall said . " I can come . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In front of the Boss Billiards . A Chinaman . Look like he has lost his liver and lights in the snow . " " I expect he has , " Stovall said . He turned to his three guests . " Anyway , we had our goose . You boys sit by the fire and work on that jug . I 'll be back . " " Doc . Mart and me have been on the road since daylight . I 'm Bitting old . If you do n't mind , I 'm going to roost . On a full stomach and thanking you ? " " I thank you too , Doc , " Martin said , " very much . I will move along with the boss . " " We 'll all go , " Ruelle said . " We 'll walk over with you , Doc . It was a fine evening . " " There is a cowboy riding , " said the stranger , " on Puerto Street in a pair of woman 's lace drawers . " " Nothing I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they shoot him . "  | Only a few vagrant flakes fell upon them when they walked out the door into the cold , into the white street . " Are you going to take a look before you turn in ? " Ruelle asked . " I want to see what happened to the Diamond G. " " Fire 's out , " the stranger said . " It just burned the ceiling off . The stovepipe got hot . " Wakefield stopped at the corner . " I do n't think I will go looking for any loaded buzzards on the shoot , " he said . " That 's my New Year resolution . " " Make that mine , " Martin said . He turned with Wakefield up the side street , toward the livery stable , and they walked alone in the unmarked whiteness . Dark in the whiteness ahead , two unsteady figures came wavering , talking , down the middle of the street . " My boy ? " It 's awright , Justice , jest a little ways now . Less go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Wakefield whispered . " And he has n't been drunk since he got his court back , since election ? " Wakefield raised his voice as the two figures came closer . " Evening ! " " Evening gennulmen , " the colored man said , holding Justice Bates up . " Need any help ? " Wakefield asked . " We is almost home ? " " Uh-h-hk , " Justice Bates said , sick . The vomit made a smoking black place on the snow . " My boy , " the justice said as he straightened . " Less go home now , Justice . " " My boy . " Justice Bates ' voice was steadier than his gait . He lurched with the colored man 's arm around his waist . " My boy . Tender yet in years . Remember this counsel ere folly o'ertake thee to thine own self be true and thou canst not be false to any man . " " Less go home now . " The dim figures wavered away . " That 's the nigger boy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the livery stable gate and Martin followed him inside . When they pulled it open , the door to the buggy shed marked  | a dragging arc on the drift of snow . Wakefield lit a lantern ; Lagrimas , quiet in the stall with the straw , turned to look into the light . In the shadowy dimness for an instant the black horse 's eyes glowed blood red . " I guess everything 's all right for the night ? what 's left of the night , " Wakefield said . " See you in the morning . " He started away with the lantern . At the door of the office where he slept , he stopped and looked back . " Ai n't much home , Mart . But it 's yours . Happy New Year . " " It 's plenty home . Happy New Year to you , Wakefield . " Martin sat down on his bunk in the dark . He pulled off his boots , and his breeches and shirt . He put his gun under the tick pillow , and took off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Warmth came to him sooner than sleep . In the last hour of the night he stirred troubled with a dream blur-figured beyond memory . Mount Jefflin seemed a higher mountain , dazzling white in the sunlight , when Martin finished breakfast by Wakefield 's cook stove , and crossed the corral to his stable chores . He had to drop the bucket hard to knock a hole in the ice when he drew water from the well ; he broke crusts from the watering troughs . A glaring silver sun warmed the air as he worked . Snow softened watery , dripping , trickling in muddy streams from adobe walls . Roof boards leaked . Mud caked on Martin 's boots . The tops and corners and sunlit open places of all of Puerto 's rawness melted dirty through its white masquerade . Martin was carrying hay on a fork when he saw the black sergeant closing the gate . He was in dress blues . His chevrons were big and bright . " Mr. Brady ! Look like you working on legal holiday ! " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duty , and got me a day pass from the post ! Happy New Year ! " " The same for you ! Like I told you yesterday , I hoped you would come see me . " The sergeant pulled a lump from inside his blue blouse . The lump was wrapped in wrinkled brown paper . He handed it to Martin . " I brought you a little something . "  | It was a minutely patterned hatband plaited of black and white horsehair . " Tobe , is that for me ? " " I made it for you , Mr. Brady . " " Made it ? Where 'd you learn this pretty work ? " " Cow camp work ! I was cowboy fore I enlisted . You know that . Live Oak County , Texas . " " Tobe ? thank you . It makes my present to you look sorry . I was going to buy you a bottle of gin for New Year 's . " " Mr. Brady , ai n't nothing noway sorry about a bottle of gin ! Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thout I offer you a drink from it so 's to kind of think back how glad we was to see the wagons at Pulpito , and how it was when we come to the river . " " I am going and get that bottle and we will have that drink . You come on in the shed and sit on my bunk , till I get back from Hogan 's Saloon . It wo n't take long . " " I 'll wait with the black horse , Mr. Brady . " When Martin came back with a bottle from Hogan 's the blue blouse with the chevrons was carefully hung on a peg by the stall . Tobe Sutton was currying Lagrimas . " Happy New Year , Tobe . " Martin handed him the bottle . " Real happy , " Tobe Sutton said . " This old stud is show horse . Just like a peacock . We ought to braid his mane ! " " Legal holiday , you said ! Put down that comb and pull the cork . I am going to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You save the rest for yourself . " Tobe Sutton put on his blouse and buttoned it before he poured the drinks in the tin cups . " What do they say down there in Mexico , Mr. Brady ? " " Salud ! " " That 's what we drink it to , Salute ! " The cups clinked . The gin was raw . " Tobe . How 's things going ? " " Shall I tell you ? My old L Troop has got a letter of commendation , from the commander of the United States Army , General Cump Sherman ! For what we done against Magues down there in the mountains . It make me proud . " " The way they say you crawled around that hill with Lieuten- ant Scanlon , and then led your men on without him , you ought to be proud . " " That ai n't it ! " Tobe Sutton hesitated . " Somebody colored , got to teach colored people ! That 's why I 'm proud . My L Troop show colored people how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You keep on , showing them . " The black face grinned . " They ai n't going to see me work over this gin ! Have just a short one , Mr. Brady . " When the drink was poured , a crease came on Tobe Sutton 's black brow . " Something I want to tell you . I ai n't no rotten talk peddler . But I am going to tell you what they say at the post . About Major Colton . While he was out fighting , a man put tracks in his yard . " Martin thought of Stovall 's glance . He thought of Ruelle 's remark . " What are you talking about ? " " The major 's wife was running around with the man that wrote the newspaper . Two days after the man left town , the major 's wife drownded herself . Let me tell you something . I talked to a corporal named Parvis , one of the guard detail at Jeilin while we was gone . Parvis was the one pulled the body from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major 's wife was in the family way . " " This Parvis ought to have his black mouth sewed shut . " " I threatened to club him to death if he said any more ! And he ai n't . But he had done talked . That ai n't all . The striker at Cap 'm Stoker 's quarters , he talked . He heard a plenty one evening . The major 's wife come crying to the cap'm 's wife . Talking loud how she hate the major , sobbing she 's going crazy , ca n't stand the noise of the wind , ca n't stand the noise of the water running over the dam , ca n't stand dirty black niggers looking at her , ca n't stand nothing about the army . Wanting to go to San Francisco , wild . And then when Cap 'm Stoker got home , the striker hear Miz Stoker break down crying , telling the cap 'm the troubles . The striker hear Miz Stoker say the words , she was , Lefty , she went to the civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That pukes me . Shut it off . "  | " Only reason I say this much , you and me was kind of tied in with the major at the last . " The major and the peon Pablo , Martin thought . They both worried about their women . The door rattled open from Wakefield 's office . " Well , " Tobe Sutton raised his voice , " old Fuego is down south stealing Mexkin horses in nice weather . The battalion is refitting . Clerk say Stoker going to be wearing gold leafs any day ? " " Hey Mart ! " " Here I am . " " Look who come to see you ? " Martin turned . He saw the stubby build of the figure coming through the door . He saw the smile . It was Ludwig Sterner . " Martin Brady ? " " Those whiskers ? I did n't hardly know you ? " " The face looks better with beard . " Martin saw the waled scars . " How are you Brady ? " " I 'm fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Sterner . " " You know each other ? " Martin asked . " Why , I seen Mr. Sterner at the post gate the day he come from the old country ! They say he was driving Mr. Wakefield 's mules for a while ? " Tobe Sutton winked . " And Mr. Sterner seen me plenty since : he kinely give me credit ! " " Your credit is good , Sergeant ! " grinned Ludwig Sterner . Tobe Sutton had wrapped his bottle in the wrinkled brown paper . " Gentlemen , " he said , " I am going to amble . " " Do n't go , Tobe . Where you going ? " " Legal holiday ! " " Do n't get in any fix ? " " Do n't you worry , Mr. Brady . Jim Crow wo n't give me no trouble neither ? I got a little make-out of a place here in town . " Tobe Sutton smiled . " My thanks , and Happy New Year . " " Come see me , Tobe . Thank you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle , crossed the mud and went out the gate .  | " Martin Brady , " Ludwig Sterner said when they were alone in the buggy shed , " I am glad to see you . " His eyes were in Martin 's face . " I came to Puerto three times to see you . But you was gone on the road with Mr. Wakefield . You never came to see me in the new store in Del Norte . You never came to see my uncle over here in Puerto . I ? want you should know you got Ludwig Sterner ? Chico ? for good friend . No matter what , I owe you always . " " You do n't owe me a damn thing . " " Yes . Always . " " Let it go . " " Ya hablo macho espanol , Martin . " " Que bueno . Ya puedes platicar con los Castro ! " " The Castros are business . The store in Del Norte is because of my uncle and the Castros . I understand that . Ah Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . I have learned . Since you went to Mexico . " " I went to Mexico because your uncle and Pancho Gil lied . That 's all right . Forget it . It 's just business . I learned too . Since I went to Mexico . " " I am sorry you do not think me as friend . " " I got nothing against you , yourself . Forget it . " " Martin Brady , the Castros got something against you . I do not forget it . I came to find you , to tell you . I came to warn you . Do n't never come across to Del Norte , " Ludwig Sterner whispered . " They try to get me to invite you to my place ! They tell me you are wanted by police in Chihuahua for stealing the ore cart and oxen and killing the man Pablo . That you have murdered many in Chihuahua and go unpunished . Martin Brady , I do not believe it . I know ? I know it here ? " he touched at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you . They will send somebody to kill you . In Del Norte surely , in Puerto if they get the chance . You believe me ? " " Yes , I believe you . " " Then if you believe me I have done something . I am grateful to do something . " Melted snow dripped steadily from the shed roof in the silence .  | Out the rickety open door , the top of Mount Jefflin stood above the walls , high and white in the sun . " How are you getting along ? " Martin said , to be saying something . " You ask . The Del Norte branch does well . American goods , retail in Del Norte , wholesale to Castro Brothers in Chihuahua . With the railroad ? then it will be immense ! I have my own place next to the store , with a cook . Martin , I have a dog now , it came to my place and is fine friend . I wish you see it ! White with black spots , and long tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I name my dog Figge , " Ludwig smiled with the scar twisting his upper lip , " after my cousin in Kassel . " Ludwig paused , and his eyes went to Martin 's . " This summer , when my face ? was better , I went for visit to Santa Fe . On Sabbath there I read Torah with my people . It was nice . I stayed with the Lindfeld family . In Santa Fe Mr. Abe Lindfeld is wholesale merchant . There is a daughter Irma , Irma Lindfeld . Ia . " Ludwig 's head was nodding up and down . " Gemiitlich ! " Martin felt himself smiling . " Good for you . Chico . " " Listen , Martin . I want to tell you something I came to tell you . " Ludwig frowned . " Do n't stay in Puerto . " " Will you do me a favor ? " " You tell me and I do it . " " I borrowed fifty pesos from Pancho Gil . I have the money now to pay him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you pay Gil nothing ! He is agent of people to do you harm ! You owe him nothing ! You save the money . " " I am not owing a plugged tlaco to any son of a bitch in the State of Chihuahua . Will you take it to him ? " " I do it , " Ludwig said , " but is foolish . " Martin counted the coins from the money belt under his shirt , and handed them to Ludwig . " Tell Gil you did invite me to Del Norte . Tell him I ai n't coming . Tell him I send his money , and thank him . " " Do n't stay in Puerto , Martin . Why do you stay in Puerto ? " " Maybe I like the place . Not exactly the way I thought I would , either . " " As a friend I ask , what plan do you have ? "  | " I 'll tell you . I 'm waiting around . When Captain Rucker gets back from Austin , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Texas Rangers . " " Rangers . " Ludwig shook his head . " And violent . You want to be violent yet . " " I guess I carry a gun for a living if that is what you mean . " " You never try anything else , Martin Brady ? " " I never had the chance , to speak of . " " You have it ! Leave for another place . Go now without the gun . Go away from old troubles . You know the care of horses and cattle , all those things ! Work to build for yourself a property , starting small . Maybe a ranch . You work . You build it bigger . If you need money , you know who to ask ? You ask Ludwig ? Chico ? Sterner . You see if you get it ! You find a nice girl and get married and have a good family and build something for them in this country and be citizen . " " You learned a lot , Chico , while I was in Mexico . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I do . " " Ach , we know different things . Some things we know together . For example , you are good man . " Embarrassed , Ludwig picked up Martin 's battered hat from the bunk , and turning it in j his hands , examined it . " The hat we sold you , before you went to Mexico . The hatband is fine . Something new . " " Sergeant Sutton made it for me . He give it to me for New Year 's . " " Black and white woven . You were . scout for soldiers bringing back their commander ? " Wakefield 's big voice called out from the office door , " What you scoundrels chewing the rag about ? Why do n't you come in here by the stove ? " " You cold , Chico ? " Martin put on his hat . " Shall we go on in the office ? " " Buster Sterner , " Wakefield said . " Buster ' do n't seem quite right with that beard . But I 'm sot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , Mr. Wakefield . Then Chico , ' " Ludwig grinned . " How is it going , over in Del Norte ? " " For business , very good . "  | " Mart , this morning I saw Gates Davis , the new Customs Collector . He gets most of the news from the south , and he tells me Governor Castro has organized a kind of state police responsible only to the governor himself . You heard anything about them ? " " No , " Martin said . " These new outfits go armed to the teeth and ride like vaqueros carrying a jackleg judge right along horseback to hold court anytime at the side of the road ! They use lots of rope damn quick , and Chihuahua is getting peaceful as hell . What about that , Buster , is it a fact ? " " You mean Rurales , Mr. Wakefield . " " That 's them . Are they doing a job ? " " Chihuahua ? has strong government . " Ludwig glanced carefully at Martin . " Your old boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't he , Mart ? " Wakefield was suddenly uncomfortable with his his own words . " No matter who runs it , it 's a sneaking damn sorry country . " " The Castros will run it , for a long time , " Ludwig said . " Buster , if my Mex ever shows up so we can leave the place , Mart and me are going out to eat . You 're invited . How about it ? We 're going to make a try at that new place on McBee Street . With a name like Sprando 's Delmonico Cafe , by God , we 're expecting celery and oysters . " " Ah , thank you ! Another time , I hope . Today I have dinner with my uncle , and I go now . I came only to greet you . I wish you both good New Year ! " Wakefield tapped Ludwig 's shoulder . " Same to you ! " " Chico , " Martin said , " I 'm glad you came . " And I am glad . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-eyed , ravaged with celebration , appeared shortly after noon . He took charge of the corral , and Martin went with Wakefield for dinner . Sprando 's Delmonico Cafe never heard of celery or oysters . When Martin and Wakefield had eaten fried pork chops and applesauce and cornbread and custard pie with coffee , and paid Mr. Sprando fifty cents , and put toothpicks in their mouths , they walked out again on McBee Street . Past spattering tin rainspouts  | and loafers leaning against walls in the welcome sun , across Puerto Street , through a muddy-footed shambling crowd , and saddle ponies , and the sound of piano music from the Fashion Saloon , and the smells of stale beer , and urine in sunless places , around a jammed corner , Martin suddenly saw John Rucker , tall and straight . " Cap ! " said Wakefield , putting out his hand , " when 'd you gir in ? " " Last evening on the San Antonio Mail . " " New Year 's with your family , " Wakefield grinned . " All well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joe ! ? Hello , Brady . " Martin shook the captain 's offered hand . A smile showed in the captain 's black beard ? Martin noticed the beard was touched with gray . The captain 's pale eyes , the remembered pale quiet eyes , looked in Martin 's face . " I saw your name in the Austin papers , " the captain said . " The dispatch from Jefflin , when the troop brought Colton back . A credit to you , Brady . I congratulate you . " " Captain Rucker , I was not sure whether you would speak to me . After what I done that night I left your house I ? " " Never mind that . " The smile was gone . " You been in any scrapes since ? " " No sir . " " Good . " Wakefield laughed . " Cap , what 's the news from Austin ? We going to keep our ranger force ? " " The legislature got around to passing the appropriation , finally ! ' Company E will be around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major Jones both . At this point , old Fuego is my main business . Brady , did you see that brute down in Mexico ? " " No sir . " The smile showed abruptly . " Funny thing , to meet you two together . Brady , I believe you were acquainted with one Abran Rascon . Joe , you remember the man that robbed your mail ? " " You caught him ! " " No . I thought you 'd like to know Abran Rascon has been unmistakably identified as the assassin of the ex-governor Salcido in San Antonio . "  | Martin swallowed , trying to hold his face immobile . Wakefield spit in the mud . " And he got away . " " Got away . Traced to the river . I expect the rascal is right popular with Governor Castro , " Rucker said , looking at Martin . " Brady , how do you stand with Castro ? Eh ? " Martin faced the pale eyes . " I quit Castro last summer , and left Chihuahua . I 'm through down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing now ? " " Working for Wakefield . " " Are you going to come around and see me ? " " If you say so . " " What 's the matter ? You changed your mind ? " " No sir . I thought maybe ? you changed yours . " " I have n't , " Rucker said . He turned to Wakefield . " Last spring I asked Brady if he wanted to enlist in my company . " " He told me about it , before he come to work . " " Could you spare him , Joe ? Are you shorthanded ? " " Hell . There ai n't much excitement shoveling horseshit and selling oats . Go on , Mart . Catch that bastard Rascon and kill Fuego for me . " The smile showed again . " You come see me , Brady . " Martin stood remembering the sound of the words in the rain , the cold rain of the sierra , " a man has to decide . " Maybe a man did n't decide . Maybe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided . But a man had to decide ? " I have to tell you something , " Martin said . " When I shook loose from Castro ? he ? I would n't be much good to you , in Chihuahua ! They do n't like me down there , Castro 's bunch do n't ? " " We 're not so fond of them either , are we ? Company E lives on the north side of the river , Brady . If you have n't got cold feet , if you want to enlist , maybe Joe Wakefield will write you a reference to go with your application . " Martin glanced around at Wakefield . " Mart , ai n't you the vice president and assistant proprietor of the Star Livery Stable ? " " Come see me , Brady . " " I will be there , Captain . "  | A package waited at the Star Livery Stable . The handyman Seguro had put it on Martin 's bunk in the buggy shed . Inside the wrapping was a fine , broad-brimmed Philadelphia hat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a folded piece of ledger paper .
