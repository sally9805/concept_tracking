No fathoms off the starboard bow <P> Look out , Skipper , pull her to the side . <P> You gon na bus ' your bow and split <P> your hide . <P> Oh , Great God , I done run aground . <P> De skipper gon na chase me with a big <P> bloodhound . <P> Mark twain , Mark twain . <P> In skintight black jeans and green sport shirt , Singer Harry Belafonte riveted his audience in Las Vegas , where he opened last week , with Mark Twain - based on the cry of the man with the lead-line on a towboat . This song , and many another in Belafonte 's repertory , represents a draft on a treasury in Washington , D.C. that to many a scholar and singer is more important than Fort Knox . <P> The treasury is a small , dim office stacked high with files and catalogues of tapes and recordings , in Room G156 of the Library of Congress . Next door is a recording studio and a small listening booth . This is the physical plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The secretary of this treasury - as well as collector , personnel manager and salesman - is a quiet , greying scholar of 47 named Duncan Black Macdonald Emrich , author of , among other things , Who Shot Maggie in the Freckle ? . <P> Souls of Dead Miners . Duncan Emrich , whose parents were Congregationalist missionaries , was born in Turkey and lived in Istanbul until he was 16 . He went to Phillips Academy and soon began picking up degrees - from Brown University ( A.B. ) and Columbia ( M.A. ) in English , from the University of Madrid ( D. en L. ) in Medieval Spanish and Arabic , from Harvard ( Ph.D. ) for a thesis on the Arabian philosopher Avicenna . In 1940 he moved to the University of Denver as an assistant professor . This changed everything . <P> Denver offered little that was stimulating in Emrich 's hobby of Arabic but much in the field of folk music . Drinking in the splintery , bare saloons of the lonely valley towns , he heard and delighted in the hoarse old songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pick , pick , pick - Has someone behind <P> us knocked ? <P> Pick , pick , pick - No , ' t is the souls of <P> dead miners locked <P> For they 're locked in the earthen wall <P> ... <P> Folk songs , as Emrich has since discovered , cover a multitude of sins - historical and otherwise . To the accompaniment of fiddles , banjos , guitars , dulcimers , bottles , tin cans and washboards , one can hear love songs , laments and domestic satires : <P> They done some brave shooting down <P> to Greeg Moor 's <P> They come so close it was almost a <P> draw , <P> But I le bet ten dollars there is nothing <P> can <P> Equil that iron-clad boat , my mother- <P> inlaw . <P> Homemade Ballad . One night in the Bucket of Blood saloon at Virginia City , Nev. , Emrich heard a miner bellow , " Who shot Maggie in the freckle ? " Back to his room he went to compose a ballad of his own that was eventually brought back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot Maggie in the freckle , <P> Who shot Maggie on the divide , <P> Who shot Maggie near Gold Hill <P> And ran away to hide ? <P> Maggie . . . never showed her freckle <P> To anyone but me , her Bill . <P> But she must have let someone see it , <P> Because there is n't a freckle any more ; <P> The Johnny who shot her in the freckle
