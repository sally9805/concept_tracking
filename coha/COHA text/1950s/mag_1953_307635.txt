The onetime Kansas farm boy , who is now an absentee Pennsylvania farm owner , took time one day last week from his capital chores for a visit to the U.S. Government 's great agricultural research center ( 11,000 acres , 1,000 buildings , 2,000 hired hands ) at Beltsville . Md . Guided by Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Benson , Dwight Eisenhower inspected greenhouses , orchards , poultry pens , prize-winning cows . ( " Of all things on the farm , " said the President , " I hated milking most . " ) Fingering a lightweight raincoat made from corn fibers and fats , he wondered , half in jest and half with his mind on staggering federal butter surpluses , if " we could make a raincoat out of butter . " <P> At a big buffet luncheon ( orange juice , lemon ice , roast beef , ham , candied sweet potatoes , potato salad , peas , asparagus , mushrooms , lettuce , onions , whole-wheat rolls , fresh strawberry pie ) , the President protested , " Oh , my belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , but at 182 lbs . he is still 6 lbs . overweight . In a mellow , after-meal mood , the guest of honor told Beltsville 's hands that he stood firmly behind the kind of research they were doing . Someone mentioned the President 's brother , Dr. Milton Eisenhower , who had once been Agriculture Department information director ( 1928-40 ) . Chuckling , Ike said : " I must tell you a story . A Congressman came in to see me the other day and was telling me what a fine man Milton was . I said , ' You need n't sell Milton to me . I think he 's the greatest man in the United States . If it was n't for his name , he would be in a high Government position . ' Well , the Congressman felt so strongly about it that he wrote me a letter in which he urged me not to let such an inconsequential reason stand in the way of bringing Milton into the Government . Then he added , ' Anyway , Milton was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were nothing but a major in the Army . ' " <P> The President also : <P> Gave his support , through G.O.P. congressional leaders , to a proposal to lend 1,000,000 tons of wheat to Pakistan . <P> Bucked to the Justice Department a U.S. Court of Claims order that he produce a long-secret report by the Securities &; Exchange Commission on the activities of the Empire Ordnance Corp. , a World War II munitions-maker . The report , said to be critical , had been suppressed by Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman . <P> Announced that the King and Queen of Greece have been invited to visit the U.S. this fall , the first visit of Greek sovereigns since that of the late George II in 1942 . <P> Announced two NATO appointments : General Joseph Lawton Collins , retiring Army chief of staff , to be the representative of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on NATO 's Military Committee and Standing Group ; and New York Textile Man John C.
