Here 's the behind-the-scenes lowdown on Luna City life and a promoter of Martian dancing girls , vaudeville , and  --  other things . But remember : stop us if you 've heard this one ! SHOW BUSINESS By Boyd Ellanby Illustrated by Mel Hunter Except for old Dworken , Kotha 's bar was deserted when I dropped in shortly after midnight . The ship from Earth was still two days away , and the Martian flagship would get in next morning , with seven hundred passengers for Earth on it . Dworken must have been waiting in Luna City a whole week  --  at six thousand credits a day . That 's as steep to me as it is to you , but money never seemed to worry Dworken . He raised the heavy green lids from his protruding brown eyes as I came in . He waved his tail . " Sit down and join me , " he invited , in his guttural voice . " It is not good for a man to drink alone . But I haf no combany in dis by-de-gods-deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I sat down in the booth across from my Venusian friend , and stared at him while he punched a new order into the drinkboard . " For me , another shchikh , " he announced . " And for you ? De same ? " Against my better judgment , for I knew I 'd have plenty to do handling that mob of tourists  --  the first crowd of the season is always the roughest  --  tomorrow , I consented . Dworken had already consumed six of the explosive things , as the empty glasses on the table showed , but he exhibited no effects . I made a mental note , as I 'd so often done before , that this time I would not exceed the safe terrestrial limit of two . " You must be in the money again , drinking imported shchikh , " I remarked . " What are you doing in Luna City this time ? " He merely lifted his heavy eyelids and stared at me without expression . " Na , in de money I am not . Dere are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I haf a goot t'ing , I am shwindeled . It is too bad . " He snorted through his ugly snout , making the Venusian equivalent of a sigh . I knew there was a story waiting behind that warty skin , but I was not sure I wanted to hear it . For the next round of drinks would be on me , and shchikh was a hundred and fifty credits a shot . Still , a man on a Moon assignment has to amuse himself somehow . So I said , " What 's the latest episode in the Dworken soap opera ? What is the merchandise this time ? Gems ? Pet Mercurian fire-insects ? A new supply of danghaana ? " " I do not smuggle drugs , dat is a base lie , " replied my friend stolidly . He knew , of course , that I still suspected him to be the source of the last load of that potent narcotic , although I had no more proof than did the Planetary Bureau of Investigation . He took a long pull at his drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down for long . Dis time it is show business . You remember , how I haf always been by de t'eater so fascinated ? Well , I decided to open a show here in Luna City . T'ink of all the travelers , bored stiff by space and de emptiness thereof , who pass through here during the season . Even if only half of them go to my show , it can not fail . " I waited for some mention of free tickets , but none was made . I was about as anxious to see Dworken 's show as I was to walk barefoot across the Mare Imbrium , but I asked with what enthusiasm I could force , " What sort of act are you putting on ? Girls ? " I shuddered as I recalled the pathetic shop-worn chorus girls that Sam Low had tried to pass off last year on the gullible tourists of the spaceways . That show had lasted ten nights  --  nine more than it deserved to . There are limits , even to the gullibility of Earth-lubbers . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you are perhaps t'inking . Martian girls . " * * * * * This was more interesting . Even if the girls were now a little too old for the stage in the Martian capital , they would still get loud cheers on the Moon . I knew . I started to say so , but Dworken interrupted . " And not de miserable girls dey buy from de slave traders in Behastin . Dese girls I collected myself , from de country along de Upper Canal . " I repressed my impulse to show my curiosity . It could all be perfectly true  --  and if it were not the opening night would tell . But it sounded a lot like one of Dworken 's taller tales . I had never been able to disprove any one of them , but I found it a little hard to believe that so many improbable things had ever happened to one man . However , I like being entertained , if it does n't cost me too much , so finally I said , " I suppose you are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars , carrying a six weeks ' supply of water and oxygen on your back , and visited the Xo theaters on the spot ? " " How did you know ? Dat is just what I did , " solemnly affirmed my companion . He snorted again , and looked at his glass . It was empty , but he tilted it into his face again in an eloquent gesture . No words were needed : I punched the symbols for shchikh into the drinkboard on my side of the table . Then , after hesitating , I punched the " two in " signal . I must remember , though , that this was my second and last . His eighth shchikh seemed to instill some animation into Dworken . " I know you feel skepticality  --  I mean skepticism  --  after my exploits . You will see tomorrow night dat I speak true . " " Amazing ! " I said . " Especially as I just happen to remember that three different expeditions from Earth tried to penetrate more than a hundred kilometers from Behastin , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , or they resorted to breathing Mars air , and never came back . And they were Earthmen , not Venusians who are accustomed to two atmospheres of carbon dioxide . " " My vriend , you must not reason : it was so , it always will be so . The brinciple of induction is long exbloded . I did indeed breathe Mars air . Vait ! I tell you how . " He took another long swig of shchikh . " Vat your Eart'men did not realize was dat dey can not acclimate themselves as do we Venusians . You know de character of our planet made adaptability a condition of survival . It is true dat our atmosphere is heavy , but on top of our so-high mountains de air is t'in . We must live everywhere , de space is so few . I first adapted myself on Eart ' to live . I was dere a whole year , you vill recollect . Den I go further . Your engineers construct air tanks dat make like de air of mountains , t'in . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I haf spent one , two , three hours in dem . I get so I can breathe air at one-third the pressure of your already t'in atmosphere . And at one-sixt ' the tension of oxygen . No , my vriend , you could not do this . Your lungs burst . But old Dworken , he has done it . " I take wit ' me only some water , for I know de Martians dey not give water . To trade , some miniature kerosene lamps . You know dey got no fuel oil now , only atomics , but dese little lamps dey like for antiques , for sentiment , because their great-grandfathers used dem . " Well , I walk through Vlahas , and not stop . Too close by the capital . Too much contact with men of odder planets . I walk also through Bhur and Zamat . I come to a small place where dey never see foreigner . Name Tasaaha . Oh , I tell you , ze men of ze odder planets do not know Mars . How delightful , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from de people by tourists so sboiled ! How wonderful , across the sands to go , free as birds ! The so friendly greetings of de Martian men . And de Martian women ! Ah ! " Well , in Tasaaha I go to t'eater . Such lovely girls ! You shall see . But I saw somet'ing else . That , my friend , you hardly believe ! " Dworken looked down at his empty glass and snorted gently . I took the hint , although for myself I ordered the less lethal Martian azdzani . I was already having difficulty believing parts of his narrative ; it would be interesting to see if the rest were any harder . My companion continued . " They not only have de chorus , which you haf seen on Earth , imported from Mars  --  and such a chorus ! Such girls ! But they had somet'ing else . " " You recall your terrestrial history ? Once your ancestors had performers on the stage who did funny motions and said amusing remarks , de spectators to make laugh . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mars they have also vaudeville ! " He paused , and looked at me from under half-shut eyelids , and grinned widely to show his reptilian teeth . I wondered if he 'd really found something new . I would even be willing to pay for a glimpse of Martian vaudeville . I wondered if my Martian was too rusty for me to understand jokes in the spoken lingo . " They haf not only men and women telling jokes . They haf trained animals acting funny ! " Dworken went on . This was too much . " I suppose the animals talked , too ? " I said sarcastically . " Do they speak Earth or Martian ? " He regarded me approvingly . " My friend , you catch on quick . " He raised a paw . " Now , do n't at conclusions jump . Let me exblain . At first , I did not believe it either . " Dey sprang it with no warning . Onto de stage came a tllooll ( you know him , I t'ink ) , and a shiyooch'iid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monocle . One wheel . The tllooll moved just as awkward as he always does , and tried to ride a tandem four-wheeled vehicle which had been especially for him made . " In spite of my resolve , I chuckled . The picture of a tllooll trying to ride a four-wheeled bicycle , pumping each of his eight three-jointed legs up and down in turn , while maintaining his usual supercilious and indifferent facial expression , was irresistibly funny . " Wait ! " said my friend , and again raised a paw . " You have as yet not'ing heard . They make jokes at same time . De shiyooch'iid asks de tllooll , ' Who was dat tlloolla I saw you wit ' up the Canal ? ' and the tllooll replies , ' Dat was no tlloolla , dat was my shicai . ' " I doubled up , laughing . Unless you have visited Mars this may not strike you as funny , but I collapsed into a heap . I put my head on the table and wept with mirth . It seemed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , no ! " " Yes , yes , I tell you . Yes ! " insisted my friend . He even smiled himself . * * * * * If you do n't know the social system of the Martians there is no point in my trying to explain why the idea of a tllooll 's being out with that neuter of neuters , a shicai , is so devastatingly funny . But that , suddenly , was not quite the point . Did it happen ? I had large doubts . Nobody had ever heard a tllooll make any sort of a sound , and it was generally supposed that they had no vocal chords . And no shiyooch'iid ( they somewhat resemble a big groundhog , and live in burrows along the canals of Mars ) had ever been heard to make any noise except a high-pitched whistle when frightened . " Now , just a minute , Dworken , " I said . " I know , my vriend . I know . You t'ink it is impossible . You t'ink the talking is faked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems Dworken had inquired among the audience as to who owned the performing animals . The local Martians were not as impressed as he was with the performance , but they guided him to the proprietor of the trained animal act . He was a young Martian , hawk-nosed , with flashing black eyes , dusky skin , and curly hair . " So I say to him , dis Martian , " Dworken continued , " ' If your act on the level is , I buy . ' I had three small diamonds with , " he explained . " But de Martian was hard to deal wit ' . First , he said he vould not sell his so-valuable and so-beloved animals . De only talking animals on Mars , he said  --  de liar ! At long last I get him to make a price . But , on condition dat he bring ze animals around to my inn in the morning , for a private audition . " " I suppose , " I interrupted , " you were beginning to have some doubts as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking tllooll and a talking shiyooch'iid all at one time is quite a lot to ask . I would have  --  " " Blease , vriend , blease ! " interrupted my companion . " Do you not t'ink old Dworken knows dese things ? Of course he does ! I t'ink . De owner , he is pulling a fake , I guess . I know dat animals do not really talk . " Next morning , I t'ink he no show up . But no , I am mistaken . Bromptly at nine o'clock he come to my inn with a little dogcart , wit ' de animals . He puts dem on de stage in de bar of de inn . They act like before . " " But they did n't talk , of course ? " " Oh , my vriend , dat 's where you are wrong . Dey talk like nobotty 's business . De jokes are funnier than ever . Even dirtier , maybe . But Dworken is not fooled . He t'ink . ' Aha ! ' I say to de Martian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not talk . Suppose you have them do de act while you outside stay , what ? ' Then I t'ink I have him . " Ze Martian tear his curly hair , flash his black eyes . He takes insult that I t'ink he is fake . ' Name of de Martian gods ! ' he cry . But at last he agree to go away , and tell animals to go ahead . " " Dworken , you were a sap to string along with him even that far , " I said wearily . " I hope you had n't paid the guy any money . " He shook his head . " No , my old and best , " he said . " Dworken no fool is , even on Mars . No , no money . But wait ! De animals go on without the owner . Same stage business , same talk , same jokes , and even funnier yedt . What ? " I started at Dworken . He did not smile , but finished off the eleventh shchikh  --  the fifth I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are you sitting there telling me you have a tllooll and a shiyooch'iid that can really talk ? " " You listen , my vriend . Like you , I t'ink something is wrong . I say to Martian owner , ' My vriend , maybe I buy your act , if you tell me how it is done . But you know as well as I do dat it is impossible to dese animals to talk . Tell me what is de trick ? ' " Dworken lifted his glass and shook it , as though he could not believe it was empty , then looked at me questioningly . I shook my head . He snorted , looked melancholy , writhed up from his chair and reached for his fur cape . " Vell , thanks for de drinks , " he said . A dark suspicion crept into my mind , but I could not restrain myself . " Wait , Dworken ! " I shouted . " You ca n't just leave me up in the air like that ! What happened then ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted it was a fake , after all , " he said mournfully . " Can you imachine it ? What a chiseler ! " ' De shiyooch'iid , ' he said , ' ca n't really talk ; de tllooll just t'rows his voice ! ' " THE END
