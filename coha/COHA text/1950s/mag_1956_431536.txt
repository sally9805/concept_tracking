I  | Why Cars Are Going to Four Headlights @# A FEW weeks , persons whose pockIN ets are disfigured by the unsightly bulge of a spare $9,000 ? give or take a grand ? can queue up to buy an Eldorado Brougham . This is a horseless carriage of quality , liberally fitted with such aids to gracious motoring as mouton . rpets , electrically released doors and a annually operated Kleenex dispenser . Surveying the delights to which he has list taken title , a Brougham buyer may well overlook the fact that his new dreamboat has four headlights . That would be a pity . The four-eyed feature is something that should not be mislaid in a cloud of hydraulically operated perfume sprayers and customtailored armrests . It is instead a solidly engineered development that promises : ? To appear on several competitive luxury cars in coming months ; ? To come out on most ( perhaps even all ) American cars a year from this fall , including those sold in large volume to Hoi and his pal Polloi ; and ? To deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners of cars having only a measly two headlights . Night and day . Driving behind the new headlamps is a pleasure , even if you are accustomed to the improved sealed-@#  | beam units brought out a little more than a year ago . ( If the older sealed-beams are your standard , the new rig supplies the same sense of wondrous revelation that a first pair of eyeglasses brings to a nearsighted person . ) This writer tried out an engineering car , cobbled up by GM 's Guide Lamp Division , on which it was possible to change at the flick of a switch from two units to the four-lamp system . On narrow Indiana and Michigan roads , the differences on high beam between the present and the new lighting were subtle but in favor of the new . The four-lamp high beams reach down the road toward the next county . On a clear night , you would need a fast car and a well-developed psychosis to " outdrive " the headlights . Twolamp high beams , in comparison , do a similar job just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacular . Light is poured precisely where you need it , down the danger area along , the right-hand margin of the road . At the times when low-beam lighting is most critical ? meeting a glarey car on a narrow blacktop road ? the new lights show off best , sneaking out about 275 feet , a gain of perhaps 100 feet of illumination alongside of and beyond an oncoming car . The new low beams give you adequate seeing for speeds up to 45 or 50 m.p.h. on an unlighted road . In contrast , many a present autoist going 30 m.p.h. on low beam is " outdriving " his headlights . They 're civil , too . The new system makes you feel inconsiderate at first : such juicy low-beam lighting , you feel . must annoy drivers of approaching vehicles . To your surprise , they go rolling past with neither irritable beam-flicking nor recourse to punitive high beams . The explanation , as you can see on care-@# @# @#  | ful study of the light pattern , lies in precise asymmetric aiming .

Engineers who have developed the new system concede that these improvements exact their price . If you press them , the engineers will tick off these drawbacks : ? The cost is a bit higher . Two extra . units , with mounts , hardware and wire are needed . Balancing the frown that this brings to Detroit 's cost accountants is the contented smile that it brings to stylists , now given a new " appearance area " to toy with . ? More juice is drawn . A car with two sealed-beam units expends 80 watts on low beam and 100 on high ; with the four-lamp installation the wattage goes to 100 and 150 respectively . These @# increases of 25 and 50 percent can be absorbed by most 12-volt electrical systems ? providing they are n't already staggering under a load of miscellaneous electrical gadgetry . Though the new lamps wo n't strictly demand it , generator capacity may be raised a bit on fourlamp cars . ? Precise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be vicious glarers . Headlight engineers refuse to concede that this is a real drawback : Present sealed-beam units can also be brutal if not set right . Mechanical aimers . The engineers argue further that the general accuracy of aim on newer cars is increasing with the widespread garage use of mechanical aimers . These are ingenious gadgets ; without them , four-lamp systems would almost certainly not be practical . Using three reference points on the face of each  | lamp unit , aimers work by measuring the relationship of the points to each other and to the horizontal . ( The reference points , when the lamps are manufactured , are held within a few thousandths of an inch of established relationships to the filaments and reflector . ) This means that the lamps can be precisely aimed just by setting them to suit the aimer jig ; they do n't even have to be turned on . In most garages such an aimer gives better results than the classic method of reading hot spots on a measured wall . Lighting engineers suspect that . under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading with tea-leaf reading . Why make the change ? The fourheadlight idea is not new . Discussed by automobile lighting experts since the late Thirties , it came strongly alive in the engineering back rooms about three years ago . The pressure came in part from three basic weaknesses of two-lamp sealed-beam lighting : 1 . In the present ' sealed-beam lamp , both filaments ca n't be ideally located . If one filament is placed at the focus of the reflector , the other one ca n't be . 2 . One lens ca n't be designed that meets the ideal requirements for both upper- and lower-beam duty . 3 . The design compromises forced by these two problems have mainly favored the upper beam , in order to provide a well-defined hot spot needed for conventional aiming techniques . But that led to a third difficulty : It is the lower beam @# @# that is the more critical one , and that is normally used more . Four lamps were clearly a way around these difficulties . But not just four identical sealed-beam units , because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of t engineering committees was two separa pairs of single-filament lamps , design ( individually for high and low-bea service . But so many other permutation were possible , too ? reflectors of 5 3/4 seven inches in diameter , combination of one- and two-filament units , and v a ous changes in filament wattages ? that the technical men debated and experimented for months before the new system was agreed upon . Not two and two . Although tempting . the notion of two entirely separate pairs of lamps was finally discarded . It was felt to be inferior to the system finally chosen ( two double-filament lamps on the outside , two single-filament ones inside ) on two counts . One was that single filaments of the wattages desired for high-beam duty got to be a trifle bulky , in respect to the reflector focus point . The other was a safety point : In icing weather , a lit headlight usually generates enough heat to keep its lens clear . On a two-and-two system , a driver switching beams in a freezing rain might find himself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . In the four-lamp system that has ultimately been adopted . only the outer two lamps are used for low beam . The filaments used then are at focus and the lenses are designed specifically for low-beam service . The result is much better lighting , especially in a higher-intensity hot spot that reaches down the road on the right side . On high beam , all four lamps are lit . In the outer pair , the not-at-focus filaments are used to give general " body " to the upper beam . The inner lamps . with filaments at focus and lenses designed for the job , do the down-thehighway work . This arrangement avoids excessive foreground lighting . Amateur experts . Contrary to cornNext month you , too , can buy a dream car , the Eldorado Brough BESIDES HEADLIGHTS TO BURN , the new luxury car has other unusual features .

There 's another quirk to the system . soon to be noted by cops everywhere . This is the fact that any car that goes by with four headlights lit is on high beam . and any with just the outer two lit is on low . This should simplify the problem of policing the slant-brow who keeps high beam on all the time . The legal side .
