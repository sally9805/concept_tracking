John Wesley Hanes , 62 , of North Carolina and New York , is a deceptively soft-spoken man of action who believes in seeing things with his own eyes . As a horse owner and a member of thoroughbred racing 's eminent Jockey Club , Hanes knew in a general way that New York 's race fans 1 ) shell out more money than devotees anywhere else and 2 ) are remorselessly packed into some of the oldest and most inadequate racing plants on the face of the earth . In the ordinary course of things , John Hanes is driven to such tracks as Jamaica , Aqueduct and Belmont in a chauffeured limousine and sits in a private box . A year ago he decided to take a closer look . // WHAT JOHN HANES LEARNED // Instead of a limousine he took the Long Island Rail Road  --  and rarelyeven got a seat on that railroad 's race-track specials : " It was like standing in a cattle car . " He decided to skip lunch in town and try the hot dogs in the grandstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to a hot-dog stand , or to a $2 window , or close to a horse  --  or within range of a comfortable seat . " // What John Hanes learned was something nobody had to tell New York 's average long-suffering $2 bettor . At the state 's four flat-racing tracks last year , 4,501,555 people wagered $374 , - 479,656 during 196 days of racing , and spent most of their time in masses of fellow horse-players suffering from tired and aching feet , empty stomachs and short tempers . Discontent drove many of them to the parimutuel windows in New Jersey . // John Hanes gave that trip a try , too . " I went down to Monmouth Park one day and made a big discovery : racing fans will put up with an insufferable train ride if they can enjoy the surroundings and conveniences at the other end . Monmouth Park offered comfortable facilities and plenty of room for everybody . No track in New York did . " // John Hanes was not the only man concerned over New York racing . Ashley Trimble Cole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fed up as the sports columnists and turf writers who for years have panned New York 's setup in terms that would look scathing even in a prison-reform report . ( One name for Aqueduct is Footsore Downs . ) Speaking to members of The Jockey Club at Saratoga 13 months ago , Cole threw something of a jolt into America 's oldest racing administrative body . // JOCKEY CLUB PRESCRIPTION // Cole told the club , whose members are well aware that theirs is the responsibility for the future of flat racing in New York , to prescribe a quick-healing remedy for local racing ills . " If you gentlemen ca n't do something about it , " warned Cole , " the Racing Commission will find men who can . " // This week The Jockey Club gave its sanction to what it hopes will eventually prove to be a guaranteed cure-all  --  if properly administered by Jockey Club doctors . The men who had made the diagnosis also prescribed the cure . A committee of three appointed by The Jockey Club , they were : John Wesley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Olin Industries , Inc. , the Bankers Trust Co. and Johns-Manville Corp. ; Christopher T. Chenery , 68 , chairman of the board of Southern Natural Gas Co. and a trustee of Washington and Lee University , and Harry F. Guggenheim , 64 , who , though he may never be remembered by railbirds as a director of Kennecott Copper Co. and as president of two family foundations , will take his place in American turf lore as the owner of Dark Star , the only horse to win a race from Native Dancer  --  the 1953 Kentucky Derby . // $15 MILLION FOR BELMONT // New York racing , suggested The Jockey Club , can best be served if all four flat-racing tracks join hands under the guidance of the club to provide comfort and convenience for all the people who like racing . " In short , " says Hanes , " invite them to come racing instead of inviting them to stay home . " High points of the proposal made to the Racing Commission for remodeling the operation of the sport in New York : // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association by buying and merging the separate corporations which now own Belmont , Jamaica , Aqueduct and Saratoga . The new Association would spend nearly $50 million now and another $45 million within a few years . // 2 . To concentrate racing on a big scale at Belmont ( completed in 1905 at a cost of about $2 million ) by investing some $15 million toward modernizing its plant and increasing seating capacity from 23,000 to 32,000 , eventually to 50,000 . The mile-and-a-half track ( largest in the U.S. ) would be reduced , and in the cutback the controversial Widener chute , which gives horses a wonderful racing straightaway and spectators the worst possible view of racing , might be doomed . Much of the work could be finished by next fall , the whole job completed by the spring of 1956. // 3 . To invest another $3 million in grandstand facilities and improved track conditions at Saratoga. // 4 . Jamaica to be discontinued as a race track and the real estate sold . // 5 . Aqueduct to be maintained as an operating track until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another ultramodern track ( cost : about $45 million ) to go up on the present Aqueduct site . // Proposed capitalization for this whopping transaction would consist of debt and non-dividend-paying common stock owned by The Jockey Club , whose members would have voting privileges to appoint the Association 's top officials . Some $27 million would be spent by the new GNYRA to purchase the four tracks ( based on an estimated valuation of $8 million each for Belmont , Jamaica and Aqueduct and $3 million for Saratoga ) . Hanes 's committee already has procured an option on over 80% of the Belmont stock and has offered to purchase the stock of the three other tracks . All four existing individual racing franchises would be kept alive and their respective officials remain in office . // The public has not been alone in its grievances about the New York situation . Private management has felt particularly handcuffed because , though the pari-mutuel takeout is 15% , highest in the country , only 4% of this goes back to the track . Thus , while other tracks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the take , can afford grand-scale improvements ( Hialeah threw open a new $2,500,000 clubhouse , Santa Anita added 5,000 grandstand seats and can now accommodate 33,000 cars and Garden State will open a track-sponsored hotel on Oct. 1st ) , New York is constantly in the throes of a tight pinch . Last year , for instance , New York State gained $32,525,600 from racing , but the four tracks could afford to spend only $1,281,250 on improvements . Over a million was spent at Belmont . Jamaica , amazingly enough , got by the year without spending one nickel on improvements , and investments at the other tracks were necessarily limited to the installation of such safety factors as sprinkler systems in the barns and building bunkhouses for stable help  --  and little else . // At the same time New York raised its purse distribution to an all-time state record of $9,535,390 . It did n't require The Jockey Club 's brains to see that the system which maintains racing at a very high purse level in the face of the least sympathetic tax laws is doomed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as taxes such of the income as it desires to take  --  after the payment of purses , operating expenses , debt service and provision for improvements . " The state , after all , " says Hanes , " should be sympathetic to more revenue . Our plan should prove to them that by lowering the percentage of the take the state can get more money  --  for the simple reason that modern enlarged facilities will attract more people who in turn will bet more money . " // LEGISLATION COMES NEXT // The proposal for the GNYRA , after its almost certain approval by Cole and his Racing Commission , will head for Governor Tom Dewey 's desk . Best bet is that Dewey will urge the next legislature to give the GNYRA a positive go-ahead . Said Hanes as discussion of the proposal went the public rounds early this week : " Our plan is to see that the country 's largest spectator sport should be a happy experience for the public , profitable for the state and comfortable for the horsemen .
