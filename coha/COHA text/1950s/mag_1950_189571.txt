Waxy little John Maragon , once a brassy man about Washington with a White House pass and the ear of Major General Harry Vaughan , found last week that he had no influence with a federal jury . Even his attorney 's plea that Maragon was only " a peanut vendor among princes " was no help . The jury found that he had lied to a Senate subcommittee in last summer 's investigation of Washington five-percenters , found him guilty on two counts of perjury.
