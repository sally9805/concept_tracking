A Story by AUBREY GOODMAN Drawings by Stanley Wyatt Y FATHER took me to lunch at the Yale Club and gave me some advice about the next four years , telling all of the Waldo stories again and advising inc not to listen to any advice from my older brother who had graduated , just barely , from Yale the previous spring . After lunch I went over to Brooks and bought some Argyle sucks and some neckties , and then , it was such a nice September day and New York looked so terrific and I felt so good , I walked all the way up Fifth Avenue to Eightieth Street . It was nearly four o'clock when I got up to the apartment and Johnnie was sitting on my bed , smoking a cigarette . " Hey , " he said . " I 've been waiting for you . " " I had to pick up some stuff , " 1 said , dumping my packages on the desk . " Excited about tomorrow ? " Johnnie asked . " Sure . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay any attention to anything 1 might have to say . " I nodded and started to finish my packing . He put a pillow under his head and went on talking to the ceiling . " Well , just do n't take everything Dad says too literally . You do n't think he thinks I 'd try to steer you wrong , do you ? " " No , " I replied , trying to find my silver tie-tac on the tray on top of my dresser . " You know , I was there . I just graduated this year from Yale and I know more about it than Dad . What did he do ? Tell you those old worn-out stories about Waldo ? " I nodded . All my life I had heard people , not just my father , but other fliers who had been at Yale with him back in the ' twenties , talk about Waldo . And from all of the stories I had evolved a pretty clear , but certainly romantic , picture of Waldo . Evidently , Waldo had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletes or the intellectuals or the fraternity and Senior Society men ; he was everyone 's hero . He seemed to have some bard mysterious glow inside hint , some vitality , that attracted people to him . They watched him when he walked down the street , they crowded around him at parties , professors were always pleased to have him in their classes , and girls from Smith and Vassar actually begged to be introduced to him . According to those who had known him , Waldo possessed all of those golden qualities usually attributed to Dink Stover and the Byronic young men created by Scott Fitzgerald . Waldo was tall , had very green eyes and close-cut yellow hair , and all of his clothes came from Brooks . He drove a fast Mercedes Runabout , but he never ran into anyone and never got a ticket . The really curious thing about him was that no one really knew him well ; people could never get close enough to him to know him completely . Waldo was just there ; he just was . No one knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dances at the Plaza during Christmas vacation , he turned up in Bermuda every spring , and he went to Europe during the summer . He drank beer fur breakfast and a split of champagne with his lunch every day . He liked to play mild practical jokes : he often put live goldfish in toilets . At one Harvard-Yale game he and his date rode to the game on a beautiful white horse . His junior year , he brought Joan Crawford to the Prom , and they danced the Charleston for an hour without stopping . Another time be was involved in a rather elaborate stunt : Waldo let his feet be strapped to the wings of an airplane which took off and flew under the Brooklyn Bridge , with Waldo standing up , waving happily to his friends standing up on the bridge . Waldo enjoyed himself . He was exciting and casual and full of fun , and people liked him . After graduation no one ever saw him again , but there was a rumor that he had been killed in the second world war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yale today , " my father always said . " Waldo could only have existed back in the ' twenties . You boys now  --  you 're scared and worried and grim , because you have to he . But nobody blames you . That 's just the way things are . People do n't know how to enjoy themselves now , and even if they did  --  they could n't . " I CL OS ED one of the suitcases and put it out in the hall . " You 're taking too much with you , " Johnnie said when 1 came back into the room . He was lying on his stomach and staring at me . " Do n't take too much with you , that 's my motto . Do you want my cashmere sweaters ? Guess I wo n't need them out on the Bounding Main . " Johnnie was going into the Navy the next month . " Thanks a lot , " I said , sitting down on a chair next to the bed . Johnnie sat up suddenly , crossed his legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . Whenever somebody does that , you know they 're going to do a lot of talking . I sat back in the chair and relaxed . " You do n't have to listen to me , Tony . Nobody can really give anyone else any advice , and God knows I never listened to anybody , but you are my brother and there are a couple of things . " " Okay , " I said . " Shoot . " " Well , I do n't know . First thing , when you get up there , do n't think for a moment that coming from Andover makes you special . Every-body is always yakking about the Andover crowd at Yale , but there 's no such thing . At least , not now , not like it was any more . It 's different when Dad was there . " " I kno ? . " " The important thing , " he continued , " is to watch the people around you . So many things start happening to people during their college years . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to protest , but he cut me off with a wave of his hand . " I know that annoys you , but it 's true . You 'll see it later . It 's just that once you hit college you start seeing things go wrong for people . Just look at most of the guys I 've known , and it seems that nearly all of them went around trying to kill themselves . I knew this one guy at Harvard  --  a real great guy , always hacking around and cutting up , making jokes , making people laugh . He seemed perfectly happy to me . Then one night he took a taxi to Logan Airport and walked into the propellers of a plane . Another friend of mine drank so much he went temporarily blind . And guys got into all kinds of trouble with girls ? marrying them because they were rich or pregnant or looked like the guys ' mothers . I know two guys who gat married , had two kids each , and then got divorces . They 're only twenty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then there are the guys who want to be scholars or archaeologists who go hack home and work for their dads or go on to law school because they let other people influence them too much . Tou many people give up what they really want to do with their lives . They toss their dreams away . " Johnnie looked sort of sad for a moment , staring past me . Then he sat up straight and went on . " And then there are all of the guys who are left out of things because they went to high schools instead of prepping . There 's quite a bit of hypocrisy and snobbery you get mixed up in without even realizing it . But it 's all confused and mixed up , because it 's great too . Most of the classes are damned terrific if you listen and read everything and the weekends are gorgeous fun and the girls are pretty . . . it 's good and bad , all mixed up . I loved it when I was there , but I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in my fraternity there was one guy who did n't get elected because he turned up for rushing one night wearing machine-made Argyle socks ! Does that make any sense ? " " Not to me , " I replied . " But it did make sense then At least , it seemed to . It 's all confusing . Everybody I knew ended up by making some huge compromise . But you ca n't help it . The main thing is that there is n't any romance in it any more . College should he a great big romance . Where did all of the romance go ? Where is it ? " He sighed . " Dad 's right , " he said . " Do n't listen to me . Go to Yale and study hard during the week and go to Smith on the weekends and go out for the right clubs and buy your clothes at J. Press and try to make Skull and Bones and marry some girl from Darien who drives a station wagon and goes to Bermuda . Do n't get off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm in no position to tell anybody else what to do . It 's just that I thought it was going to be like Waldo , and it was n't , and I was disappointed . Just try not to build things up too much . " " 1 wo n't , " I said . " Because if you go along expecting too much and being disappointed all the time , next you find yourself expecting nothing out of anything , just to avoid being disappointed , and when that happens you might as well be dead . Then you . - oh shut me up . What are you doing tonight ? " I did n't have any plans . " Listen , Tony , Mother and Dad are going to be out anyway , so why do n't you come to a party with me . Over at Lee 's . Come on . He 's collected quite a menagerie of friends , and it 'll be different for you . Something new . " " Okay , " I said . Johnnie got up and straightened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl Lee was always with ? " I asked . " Constance ? From San Francisco ? " " She was beautiful , " 1 said . I remembered that she had a beautiful face with bright blue eyes and clean-looking , soft brown hair that she wore down to her shoulders . Lee had brought her up to dinner a couple of times , and she had charmed me off the wall . She had a way of looking right into your eyes when she talked to you . " Well , after going with Lee for four years , she married some guy from Westport , " Johnnie said . He threw his arms up in the air and said , " See what I mean ? " " Guess so , " I answered , and Johnnie went into his own room . 1 , E E was Johnnie 's best friend . They had J been in the same class at Andover and Yale , and Lee used to come home with him for weekends and Thanksgiving . Lee was from Oklahoma , but he came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an advertising agency . He wanted to be a writer and he had terrific ideas , but I never saw anything he wrote , Mother and Dad liked him very muck They thought he was a good influence on Johnnie . I was never so sure about that , but I had to admit that Lee was one of the most interesting people I 'd ever met . His apartment was right around the corner from us , between Madison and Park . He had hundreds of books in cases and on the mantel and stacked on tables , two portable television sets , a portable air-conditioner , a closet filled with liquor , some watercolors of New York and drawings of Yale and Andover on the walls , a silver top hat he 'd worn to a costume ball tt the Plaza , a wooden shoe from Holland , a sun lamp , a bar bell , half a dozen of those large ashtrays from the Stork Club , a cigarette box that played " Boola Boola , " a hi-fi set and a tremendous collection of records , mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Whiteman and Helen Morgan . He had a small garden out in back with a large stone turtle . I liked Lee and enjoyed being with him , but I never particularly cared for the people he had around him . He never seemed to be alone , and everybody around him seemed to be distinguished in some odd way . There was a girl who 'd been on a safari in Africa once , a guy who 'd been stabbed in the face by a countess with a salad fork , a man who 'd been hit on the head by a telephone switchboard while he was walking down Wall Street , a girl from Spain who was writing a novel in French , a male prostitute , a female lawyer , sons and daughters of famous actors and actresses and writers . And then , mixed in with these people , he had the friends he 'd known in schools . I liked all of the last group very much , although they were older than I was . I was glad to be going to Lee 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't feel like knocking around the apartment by myself , but I was n't too excited . I honestly do n't like parties too much . I love to go to dances , but I do n't enjoy gatherings where people just stand around and talk and toss down the liquor . There are two good reasons for my feeling this way . I 'm very shy and 1 do n't like to drink . It 's funny , but most people get the impression that I 'm a deep thinker because I do n't talk very much . However , it does n't necessarily follow that a person is really intelligent because he keeps quiet most of the time . Sometimes it 's because he 's not very bright and does n't have anything at all to say . With me , I like to think it 's just because I 'm shy . About the drinking , I do drink beer sometimes . You ca n't very well sit at Ryan 's or Con-don 's and listen to jazz with a pretty girl and drink Cokes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get sick and vomit . So , as I have a difficult time talking to strangers , we usually just do n't connect , and as I do n't enjoy drinking martinis , I 'm not too crazy about cocktail parties . I usually end up standing by myself in a corner , watching the people , eavesdropping on other people 's conversations , and reading the titles of the books on the shelves . Another thing I do n't like about most parties in New York is that everyone tries too hard to give the appearance that they are having a wonderful time . Sometimes I 'm sure that the people really are having a good time , but sometimes 1 wonder if most of them feel the same way I do but wo n't show it . We went over to Lee 's about nine-thirty . The apartment was full of people , and they were all trying to outdo each other  --  laughing very loud , holding their drinks high in the air . " I wonder where Lee is , " I said to Johnnie after we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he yelled into my ear . Then he walked away and left me . I did n't see Lee . The party looked like several others I 'd seen around New York . It was n't a social party or a Village party ; it was a mixed-up party . The people were all different ages , and I do n't think many of them had too much in common . I went into the kitchen and poured myself a glass of ginger ale and prepared to go in and read the book titles . As I was trying to edge my way away from the sink , someone shoved me . I looked around and saw a young man with a pained expression on his face and one arm up in the air . " Is there any butter over here ? " he demanded . " Stick it under the faucet , Bobby , " said a small girl who , was hanging onto his other arm . " Do n't make a fuss . " " A fuss ! " Bobby exclaimed , turning on the faucet full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that guy ? murder him . " " You 'll do nothing , " the girl said , looking into her drink as if she had dropped something into the glass and was trying to find it . " You brushed up against the man 's cigarette . He did n't mean to burn your hand . " " Shut up , " Bobby said , crossly . " Wear gloves , " the girl said , giggling . " What am 1 going to do ? And I 'm supposed to make that film tomorrow . " " Are you an actor ? " I asked . He looked at inc and said smoothly , " Yes , I am . " " Hah ! " the girl snorted . " Do n't pay any attention to her , " he told me . " She 's an idiot . I am an actor . Are you in the theater ? " " Oh no , " I said . " But I 'm always interested in meeting people on the stage . Do you know Marilyn Monroe by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . I could n't figure out what that meant . " I 'm a dramatic actor , all right , but recently I 've been doing these TV commercials . It 's just a temporary thing . I 've been doing things with my hands . " gave him a blank look . " You know , " he continued , " picking up cans of beer , holding cigarettes , stuff like that . Of course , it 's not really acting , but what are you gon na do ? " " Stop ignoring me ! " the girl said loudly . " There are two kinds of people in this world  --  those who ignore and those who are ignored . And I 'm tired of being ignored . " " I 'm not ignoring you , doll , " Bobby said , smiling sweetly at her . " I 'm rejecting you . " I WALKED into the living-room , but did n't see Lee , so I started circling the room . No one paid any attention to me . I must have walked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went over to the bookcases . I 'd finished a couple of shelves when a middle-aged woman with platinum hair and gum in her mouth came over and told me I looked familiar . " Do n't I know you ? I know I know you . Ever go to a night spot called the Play Pen ? " I told her that 1 was afraid not . Then she asked me if she could fix me a drink , and I told her that I did n't drink . " Oh , " she said , looking at me sympathetically and nodding , as if I had just made some deep confession and she was assuring me that she understood . " Alcoholic . " This struck me as being pretty funny , so I nodded . " Well , anyway , " she said , patting her hair , " I know I 've met you somewhere else . " She spat her gum into a wastebasket and then added , " Socially . " I nodded and she turned around and started talking to a man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , darling ! That 's why everyone is acting so wild ! " I heard a woman with long earrings shout at a small group of people . A Lester Lanin record was playing on the hi-fi and several people were trying to find room to dance . I looked all around , trying to find Lee , but I did n't see him . Johnnie was standing by the door with one of the most beautiful girls I 'd ever seen . I walked over to them and saw that he was trying to make her take her coat off . " Come on , Hope , take your coat off and stay a while , " he was saying . But I ca n't , Johnnie , I told you I ca n't . I have to be someplace else , and I just stopped by for a couple of minutes , " the girl said , trying to be nice about the whole thing . " Tony , " Johnnie said to me , this is Hope Paradise . Is n't that a name for you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the girl said . " Please let go of my ... " " Aww , just stay for a little while . Just a little longer , " Johnnie asked . " Please . " " I 'd like to , but I ca n't , Johnnie , so please let go of- . . " Iohnnie let go of her coat and she went out the door , closing it behind her . " Who was that ? " I asked . " Girl 1 know . A model . " " Oh , " I said . " Well , I have to go to the bath-room . " " Great conversationalist , " my brother said , clapping me on the back and walking away from me . A girl in a blue dress was sitting on the edge of the bathtub , crying . I stood there for a moment , not knowing what to do , then I went over to her . " Hey , " I said quietly . " What 's the matter ? " " Nobody loves me , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , " I said , trying to comfort her , " sure they do . " " No , " she cried . " Nobody loves me . " " Well , " I said brightly , " nobody loves me and I 'm not crying ! " This failed to cheer her up . " O00000h , " she cried . " I 'm so unhappy . Nobody loves me at all . " She went on crying . " Do you love somebody ? " I asked . " No , " she said , wiping her eyes . " I ca n't . " , " Why not ? " " Because nobody loves me , " she said and started to cry again . " I 'll get you a drink and you 'll feel better , " I said . " Be right back . " I had to wait in line to get at the liquor . Finally I moved in close enough to pour out a glass of Scotch for the girt . When I went back into the bathroom , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around for her . Then I saw her  --  dancing and laughing merrily with some guy . Annoyed , I put the glass down . Johnnie waved at me from the other side of the room . I went over and asked him if he was having fun . " Tony , " he said , throwing his arm around a guy with sad brown eyes , " tell this jerk lint to go into a monastery . " " Do n't go into a monastery , " I said . " See , Nicco ? " Johnnie said , leaning against a bookcase . " But I want to get away from everything , " Nicco said , looking at me with those unhappy eyes . " I do n't like anything very much . " " Do n't you have to have some kind of religious calling to become a monk ? " I asked . " I do n't know , " Nicco said , shrugging his shoulders . " I do n't know anything about it . I do n't even know where any monasteries are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know where to go . " He smiled sadly , and Johnnie pushed him into a chair . " Wait here a minute , " he said . Johnnie pulled a book from the case and put it in Nicco 's lap . " You just look at that book , " Johnnie said emphatically . " Study it . Marvel at its beauty . Contemplate it . And you 'll forget this monastery bit . " Nicco opened the hook . It was a collection of art photographs of naked women  --  running along the beach , lying on the dunes , hanging out of sling chairs . I was looking over Nicco 's shoulder as he flipped the pages . " Seen Lee yet ? " Johnnie asked me . " Not yet , " I said , my eyes fastened on a woman doing things with a giant beach balloon . " Where are your manners ? " he asked , pretending to be shocked . " I could n't find him , " I said , still looking down . " He 's in the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Doing what ? " I asked , looking up . " She 's here with her husband , " Johnnie said . " Go on in and pay your respects . " " I will , " I said , taking a last look at the book . W HEN I walked into the bedroom , I found Lee and Constance sitting on a huge double bed , dipping melba rounds into a jar of caviar . They seemed to be having a very serious conversation . Constance looked so pretty in a white dress , and Lee looked great . He was wearing a blue blazer and a striped tie . " Everyone spends too much time trying to be a psychiatrist , " Lee was saying . " Everybody is analyzing everybody else and they 're amateurs and not fit for the job . People are so busy analyzing each other that no one seems to be just friendly any more . " Constance nodded . " You should get married , Lee , " she said . " Why ? " Lee asked . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all said hello , and they resumed their conversation . " Darling , " she said to Lee . " You do n't know . You just do n't know . " " Well , tell me , " he said . " I 'm convinced . What is so wonderful married ? " " It 's , well , it 's going to sound corny , but it 's so true , " she said , passing her hand through her long brown hair " It 's being together . Blanton and I are so happy because we share things . We have breakfast together and talk about everything and read the same books and see the sametelevision shows . And we go shopping together and fix dinner and do the dishes and then go to bed . Sometimes we stay up until five in the morning , just lying there in bed , talking about things and smoking . It 's just being together . Everywhere . " " So that 's what being married is , " Lee said , trying to balance the jar of caviar on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's fine , " Lee said , putting time jar back on the bed . ' But Constance . " " What ? " " All of those things you were just talking about , " he said . " We did exactly all of those same things for several months . And we were n't married . So what 's so wonderfully different about being married ? " Constance opened her mouth , closed it , looked at Lee for a moment , brushed the crumbs off her skirt and stood up . " What a disgustingly common thing to say , " she said . She walked out of the room and Lee offered me some caviar . " My ' pologies , " Lee said . " Please excuse my vulgarity . But I 'm right . That 's the saving factor . How 've you been , Tony , old scout ? " He was pretty tight . We got up and walked out into the garden , and I told him that I was going up to New Haven the next afternoon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Men . A gorgeous playground . " " Johnnie tried to give me some advice this afternoon , but it was pretty confusing , " I told him . We sat down . " And Dad just told me all those old stories about Waldo . " " A mistake on both their parts , " Lee said . " They just wanted to help me , " i said . " You 're going to Yale , so you just go to Yale and you do what you want to do and make your own mistakes if you have to . That 's all . No advice . But Waldo . Ah , those must have been the days . " " Dad says that Waldo could n't exist at Yale today , " I said . " He 's right , " Lee replied , offering me a cigarette . " You wo n't find a Waldo at Yale or any other place , for that matter . Not now . We 're just not set up to produce a Waldo . I think the world is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look in the other room . What do you see ? Frustration and confusion , A group of lonely , scared , fake children . People who have selected marriage or alcohol or drugs or religion or sex or suicide or some form of destruction or self-destruction just as they would have chosen a course in college , thinking it would give them something . And what 's the result ? Emptiness and fear . I mean , besides a lot of damned nonsense , the result is confusion and frustration , frustration and confusion . " I was silent for a minute , and then I said , " Sounds pretty depressing . " " Nah , " Lee said , putting his band on my knee for a moment . " Forget it . Maybe it 'll pass . You do n't have to live in it for four more glorious years . You 've got those Bright College Years in front of you , and things may have changed by then . You 'll have a great time up at New Haven . " " I hope so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you something , Tony , " Lee said . " I 'll make a confession . Do you know what I am ? " I shook my head . " An imitation Waldo , " he said . " A fake . I 'm just as had as those other people inside . Maybe worse . It 's a hard thing for me to admit , but 1 tried to pass myself off as a Waldo . Doing crazy things . Trying to be exciting and casual and all of the things Waldo was supposed to be . Collecting props for my rooms at school , searching out unusual people . I think I fooled some people . I know I fooled myself for a long time . But it was n't real . Not for a minute . " I sat and tried to see his face in the darkness . " Sometimes , " he said , " I wonder if the real Waldo was n't a fake too. - " He could n't have been , " I said . He agreed , and we went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to con- vince some girl to come over and join him at the party . I told him that I was leaving and he just nodded and went on talking into the phone . I said good night to Lee and he wished me luck . Then I walked on home . It took me about two hours to fall asleep . W HEN I woke up late the next morning , the sky was gray outside the windows . Johnnie came in and put his cashmere sweaters into one of my suitcases , Mother gave me an extra fifty dollars and after lunch I went down to Grand Central . The train pulled into New Haven about four , and I took a cab up to the Old Campus where all of the freshmen live . It was a sad afternoon , dark and cold and raining , and everything I saw looked depressing and ugly  --  the people on the street , some old drunken bums , a woman slapping her child , the gray buildings , everything . I picked up my room key and went over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had not arrived . Neither had the two new guys who had been put in with us to share the two bedrooms and living-room . All three of the rooms looked pretty bare . It was cold , and I felt sort of sick . I had a very bad headache , and I was tired . So I went into one of the bedrooms , lay down on one of the beds , spread my coat over me and closed my eyes . I do n't know how long I slept , but it was dark when I woke up . I heard whistling . Someone was whistling " Among My Souvenirs . " I got up and went into the living-room , but no one was in there . I saw a large steamer trunk with Cunard stickers on it , half-a-dozen bottles of champagne , and , on the mantel , a framed photograph of a young . man standing on a beach with his arm around the waist of a girl who looked exactly like Marilyn Monroe . The whistling stopped , and I turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other bedroom . He was tall and had close-cut yellow hair and green eyes , and he was holding a bowl of goldfish . " Hello , " he said , smiling . " I 'm Waldo. "
