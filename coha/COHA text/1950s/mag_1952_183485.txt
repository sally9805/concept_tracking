Truck Driver Michael Sinai of West Mifflin was waiting for a mild day this week to load his wife and children into the family car and drive around the western Pennsylvania countryside . They were hoping to run across the smell of skunk . To Andrea Sinai , 8 , this was very important . She has never smelled a skunk-in fact , until recently , she had never smelled anything . Andrea was a rare medical case , a baby born with a bony obstruction blocking both nostrils . <P> In 38 years of specializing in nose &; throat troubles , Philadelphia 's Dr. Matthew S. Ersner had seen only one previous case . If it had not been for an alert doctor who spotted the trouble when she was born , Andrea Sinai 's chances of surviving would have been slim-she might have choked on her first bottle . As it was , she had to be fed with a medicine dropper . Often she choked and started to turn blue . Her mother hardly ever knew a good night 's sleep ; she kept waking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing . Because her mouth was always dry , Andrea 's food did n't taste good and she was underweight . <P> Three months ago , Dr. Ersner drilled through the bony obstructions and put a rubber tube through both nostrils so that scar tissue would not close them again . Even with this partial relief , her food tasted so much better that Andrea began to eat like a wolf and gained nine pounds . Last week Dr. Ersner took the tube out , and Andrea went on a smelling binge , running from food smells to her mother 's perfume bottles . <P> To Dr. Ersner , the most interesting thing about Andrea 's case was that her sinuses were fully developed . " All our lives , " he said , " we 've been teaching that sinuses need aeration to develop completely . Apparently we were wrong . " Said Andrea as she left for home : " Doctor , I want to smell a skunk . "                    @
