I Jerry Welch was a copilot for Pacific Coast Airlines  --  a slender young man with black hair , crew cut , and gunmetal eyes . He moved with unconscious grace , like a dancer , or a good middleweight fighter . He seemed taller than he was because of his lean , whiplash body , and his smile had broken hearts up and down the West Coast . He was walking around his twin-engine aircraft , peering suspiciously at the sleek , aluminum plane . The mechanics had fueled the aircraft and run the engines , but Jerry , as copilot , had to go through the ritual of preflight inspection . It was a boring chore , but he did not mind and did it meticulously because , although he did not wish to live forever , he did not want to die because he failed to observe one small detail of the airplane which , insignificant on the ground , could become monumental in the air . A mechanic approached Jerry and said , " Think it 'll fly ? " " I doubt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a " You still flying with Brickley ? " Jerry nodded . " That 's right . " " How do you get along with old Stoneface ? " " All right . I jerk the wheels and flaps and keep my mouth shut . " " Yeah , that would be the way to do it , all right . " The mechanic stared up at the airplane , then flipped a hand toward it . " Bet you a dollar he writes us up for something . I never saw such a finicky guy in my life . " " I know , but he 's like the old Model T. He gets you there and gets you back . fly with him any time . " " Yeah , I guess that 's right . But it seems to me he could be a little less like an old woman . " " He wants to be an old pilot . " In the operations office , David Brickley , the captain of the plane which Jerry was observing so suspiciously , was going through the preflight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighing his fuel load against the number of hours he would stay air-borne , plus additional gasoline for the required safety factor . He checked the intangibles against known facts , worked out carefully by technicians who could prove , on their slide rules , that this airplane on this particular flight from Los Angeles to San Francisco would do just exactly what was expected of it . Provided , David thought , that someone did n't goof . This suspicion of all things that took to the air was one reason for the gray hairs flecking the black ones along his temples . David Brickley had great faith in his aircraft  --  in the engines which spun the propellers , in the design of the wings which gave it lift , in the electronic aids which helped him drive that airplane to the end of the runway and brush his tires on the concrete at the end of his trip . David sometimes wished that people were as infallible as machinery , but he knew that they never were . Because of this consciousness of human frailty , David Brickley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , with Pacific Coast Airlines . He had Aver even come close to bending a propeller on one of the airplanes which he flew . To a small degree This was , he knew , due to plain and simple luck . But to a very much larger degree , it was due to the fact that he regarded people with suspicion and knew that it was a very definite possibility that a mechanic could have a hang-over and neglect one small detail which could snowball into a crash some black and wind-swept night , He knew how many crashes had been traced to " pilot error , " and he did not intend to have that happen , Although he defended David to others , Jerry Welch had little affection for the man . To him , David was taciturn , a bit too dedicated , and inclined to be so cautious about flying that it seemed to show that the man was afraid . If he had mentioned that fact , David would have said , " You bet I 'm afraid . All the fearless guys ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his private life was his own business . He had said as much to David , who had looked at him coldly . " Your private life is the business of every man , woman and child who climbs into your airplane . Who knows how many cases of pilot error could be traced back to the fact that a pilot had a fight with his wife the morning before take-off ? " Jerry shrugged . " I do n't have a wife . " " Or maybe a pilot was a hair less alert than he should have been because he was out with some blonde instead of logging some sack time . Or " ? and he looked at Jerry pointedly ? " maybe he was less concerned with flying an airplane than he was with making love to another man 's wife . " " Look , if you 're speaking of Jennifer McMillan , you 're way off base . " " If I 'm way off base , how did you know it was Jennifer I was thinking of ? " " Because everyone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish the woman would drop dead . She 's making a pest of herself . " " You should have thought of that in the beginning . " Jerry shrugged . ' Sure , sure . So Pete McMillan is ten years older than she is . So she flew up to San Francisco three months ago . So we went out on the town . What 's wrong with that ? We hit a few Dixieland joints  --  we went out to the beach  --  we had a few laughs . So what ? " " Do n't kid rne , Jerry . You 've met her in San Francisco four times , all told . " " Three times . " " All right , three times , " David said . " Just one more time , Jerry , and you do n't fly in my airplane any more . You can fly , Jerry , technically , but I do n't want anyone in the right-hand seat who gets himself loused up with a married woman . Sooner or later there 'll be trouble . " Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I have n't seen her for a week anyway . " " Good thing , " David said . " Pete McMillan had a few too many up in the Sky-room the other night . Jim Peterson heard him muttering about getting himself a fly-boy Romeo , That 'd be you , Jerry . You know these quiet guys . When they blow a stack , they blow it clear up into the stratosphere . " " The guy does n't worry me . " " Maybe not , " David said , " but he worries me . " Now their plane was at the loading camp , and Karen Johnson stood just inside the open door of the aircraft and greeted the passengers as they came aboard . Karen was a blonde , as perfectly groomed as a millionaire 's shrubbery , and as fresh and as dewy in appearance as a golf course at dawn . She had been a stewardess for six years and was now twenty-seven years old . The novelty and glamour of her job had long since been rubbed away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not eagerly , but hopefully , for the young doctor , the successful attorney , the brilliant young businessman . She did not think of Eric Erlandsonor rather she tried not to think of Eric , who was presumably at this moment at sea somewhere , working at his trade  --  first mate on the cargo-type ship , the SS James Stoddard . Whenever she though t of Eric , she received several messages . The visual one showed her Eric 's blond , crew-cut hair , streaked by the sun and wind , his incredibly blue eyes , his weathered skin and his teeth that slashed whitely across his mouth when he smiled . The audio portion of the message came with his low , measured speech and the hint of a chuckle when he teased her . The physical portion of the message would have her feeling his powerful arms around her and his clean , hard mouth against hers when he kissed her , But that was over . That was in the past and buried . Karen did wish that the time would soon come when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had long since given up the thought of marrying a pilot , having learned that most of them were married to beautiful young creatures who drove sports cars . The others , like Jerry Welch , had too much fun playing the field and wanted marriage the way they wanted an aching molar . Two young couples came up the ramp , arguing good-naturedly . Karen was forced to smile more than professionally . The women were handsome , long-legged , young and sleek . One was a blonde , with a wind-swept haircut . The other had hair the color of well-rubbed walnut , eyes that seemed as large as cherries , dark brown in color , with tiny golden flecks . Their husbands were dressed almost alike . Gray flannels , cashmere jackets , fine shoes , knitted ties . Both carried lightweight raincoats , One was a black-haired , black-eyed young man with a scar across his chin . The other was tall , rawboned , looking much like a professional baseball player , except for his prematurely gray hair which stood up straight and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any age from twenty-nine to thirty-nine . " Oh , no , you do n't , Dick Charlton , " the blond girl said . " You sat by the window coming down . " " You said yourself that heights make you dizzy , " her husband , the black-haired young man , said . " It is n't altitude , " the gray-haired young man said , grinning . " It 's those stingers she had , plus the fact that she was born dizzy . " " Ha ! " the girl said , " Listen to old bones . Sue , I leave it to you . How many stingers did I have ? " " Who counts ? " the brown-haired girl said . " It is n't polite , Ellie . " Ellie Charlton pushed her husband aside and sat by the window . Dick Charlton dropped into the seat beside her . Sue and Philip White sat across from them . " I 'm hungry , " Phil White said , " Fasten your seat belt , " Sue said , " and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt , " I 'm still hungry . " " I 've often wondered , " Sue said , " about these seat belts . What 's the idea of them ? " " Keeps people from chasing the stewardess up and down the aisles . " 9.2 ' r II IS SATURDAY EVENINO POST " I 'm serious , smarty . " Sue turned to Dick and Ellie . " Dick , why do they have seat belts ? " Dick grinned . " Keeps people from chasing the stewardess up and down the aisles . " " Oh , honestly ! " Ellie said . " You two stick together like glue . Another thing , Dick ; what happens if one of the engines stops w ork Mg ? " " They ca n't stop working . These airplanes are maintained by mechanics so well trained and their maintenance system is so good that they just do n't have engine failure . Besides , these planes are designed to fly on one engine . " " Oh . " Ellie sucked a linger thoughtfully . " Then if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so the plane can fly on one engine ? " " Oh , no ! " Dick moaned . " You are n't going to start that feminine-logic routine , are you ? " " 1 know why , " Sue said . " Why ? " Dick said . " Keeps people from chasing the stewardess up and down the aisles , " " That does it ! " Phil said . " Dick , you want to sit in one of the rear seats with me ? We can spread out a magazine and play gin rummy . " " Best idea you 've had in months , " Dick said . He and Phil unfastened their seat belts and went to seats in the rear , got a magazine bound with hard covers , put it on their laps . Phil took some cards out of his pocket and they started to play . The two women got out of their seats after a short conference , came to the rear and sat across the aisle from their husbands . " We are n't going to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ca n't imagine why not , " Phil said .... " Can you . Dick ? " Dick Charlton shook his head . " No one would try to pick up a couple of old married women . " " Oh . you think not ? " Ellie said . " We 're living dolls , " Sue said , " and you characters know it . " " Modest , too , " Phil said . " And quiet , " Dick said . " Hardly ever say anything , either of them . " He dropped a card , face down , in the discards . " I 'll knock with three . " Atall , rugged-appearing man in his middle thirties boarded next . His hair was brown , his mouth was wide and thin-lipped . There were marks of trouble on his countenance , and his eyes , under heavy brows , seemed to look out upon the world as if he had seen a great deal of it and was unimpressed . His name was Blair Hanover , and at nineteen he had enlisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division . He had been wounded in Holland and , before he got back into action , the war was over . He was one of four survivors out of his original platoon . He had stayed out of the service four years , and then a fast-talking marine sergeant had caught him in a weak moment . and he found himself , somewhat to his surprise , a marine , assigned to the Fifth Marines . Korea put a few more deep lines in his face , took away part of a rib and gave him another Purple Heart . Now he was a staff sergeant  --  a drill instructor  --  and was on leave . He had four hundred and fifty dollars in his pocket and he was headed for San Mateo , for no other reason than the sound one of having nowhere else to go . His boyhood had been spent in San Mateo , and he supposed that he wanted to return , as anyone else would go home . Blair Hanover had no home worthy of the name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down , fastened his seat belt and closed his eyes . Behind Blair ! lawyer came a couple who acre so obviously newly wedded that they seemed wrapped in cellophane , The girl was wide-eyed , young and very pretty , with a generous red mouth and a little cleft in her chin . She was wearing a suit , a hat and an orchid corsage . Her husband was equally young , wearing a new gabardine suit . moccasins , a striped tie and a white shirt with a hutton-down collar . He was a tall young man and looked like any kid who just a few years ago was mowing lawns to buy gasoline for his hopped-up V-Eight . They got settled in a seat , the boy helped his bride fasten her seat belt , then she turned to him and sighed , " Gee , Roger , can you believe it ? Mr. and Mrs. Roger Simpson ! " " Boy ! " he said . " And here we are , on our way to San Francisco for our honeymoon . " " Yep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamy of dad and mother to give us airplane tickets ? " " Yeah , and I got something else to show you . " Roger reached in his inside coat pocket and brought out a thin leather billfold . He opened it slightly and said , " Look . " His bride , Jill . peered , and then said , " Rog ! A hundred-dollar bill ! " " Uh-huh . Dad gave it to me at the reception . Said to spend it foolishly . " He put the billfold back in his pocket and patted it . " How about that ? " " Let 's save it , " Jill said . " I mean buy a bond or something . Or put it in a safe-deposit box or something . " " We 'll see . " " Oh , Rog , I 'm so happy . I 'll never be this happy again , " He took hold of her hand and smiled at her . " Yes , you will , honey . This is only the beginning . You 'll always remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believe me . " " When 7 Tell me . " " Well , first of all ? " he began . Karen Johnson watched the newlyweds strap themselves in and smiled inwardly , and then suddenly she felt unaccountably lonely . For some fool reason she felt that tears were coming to her eyes , and she told herself to stop being sentimental . Lately . she chided herself , you 've been coining unglued every rime you see newlyweds , a baby , or a man kissing his wife . Next thing you 'll start collecting dolls , She stopped the oncoming tears and turned toward the opened doorway . A slender , blond young man wearing slacks. tweed jacket and desert boots came bounding up the ramp . He grinned at Karen . " This Flight One-eight-one ? " He stopped in the doorway and peered carefully at Karen . " You the stewardess ? " Karen was so glad to see Eric Erlandson that she very nearly threw her arms around his neck , and this realization so annoyed her that she snapped , " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' blister Frlandson . ' Hey , are n't we formal ? " Karen sighed , then said , " Eric , what are you doing here ? " " Me ? Why , I 'm going to fly from Los Angeles to San Francisco . " " Obviously , but that is n't what I meant . " " All right , Karen . I took the coastwise loop off my ship while she goes up to Seattle and back . I have three weeks ' vacation , and I 'm going to spend every bit of it flying Pacific Coast Airlines aircraft , provided the stewardess is a gal I 'm in love with . O.K. ? " " It wo n't do any good , Eric . I told you that . " " I know . But somehow you just did n't sound convincing . " Behind Eric , a man was coming up the ramp , and Karen said , " Here 's another passenger , Eric . I ca n't talk about us now , You 'd better take your seat . " Eric grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seat and settled into it . The man who was coming up the ramp behind Eric said , " Hello , Miss Johnson . " It was Pete McMillan , who was in charge of one of the maintenance docks for Pacific Coast Airlines . He was a gaunt-faced man with thinning hair , a long nose and brown eyes deeply set . Right now the eyes seemed to be sunken deeper than usual into his head . There were dark spots running from the inside of the eyes down to his cheekbones . He was carrying his hat , and his hair , in the wind which swept the airport , looked dull , lifeless and unkempt . What was the strangest thing of all to Karen was that the man was wearing a raincoat . Los Angeles had had no rain for three weeks , and was not likely to have any for another three weeks . " Why , Mr. McMillan , " Karen said . " Nice to see you . How 's Mrs. McMillan ? " " She 's  --  she 's fine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments as if he were trying to come to some decision . He half turned away , as if to go back down the ramp , looked behind him , then abruptly turned and entered the airplane . He went directly to a forward seat and dropped into it , still wearing his raincoat . Karen frowned and wondered whether she should report Pete McMillan 's arrival to David . Why , she was n't sure , except that she had heard the talk about Jennifer McMillan and Jerry Welch . Maybe Pete wanted to have a talk with Jerry in San Francisco . Maybe he was on airline business . Certainly , whatever he was doing , she decided , was none of her business . An airline employee came up the ramp and handed Karen the manifest . " That 's it , " he said . " Good trip . " " Thanks , and good-by , " Karen said . Up front , David and Jerry had just finished going through the printed check list , They did this solemnly and thoroughly , and although each one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each item . " O.K. , we 're in business . " David said . He peered out the window . A man stood by with a fire bottle . He made a circular movement with one hand , David and Jerry 's hands worked in unison . The propeller on the Number Two engine turned once , twice , three times , and then the engine burst into life . Then Jerry left his seat , went to the cabin and activated the switch which lifted the stairs hydraulically into the airplane . Then he went back to the front end , and they started Number One . Life was breathed into the airplane with the rumble of both engines , and Jerry picked up the microphone . " Tower from One-eight-one . Ready to taxi . " ( Continued on Page 94 ) // The tower cleared them , and the airplane shuddered rhythmically as David advanced the throttles and drove the plane around to the end of the runway . In the cabin , Karen had checked all the scat belts . She had to remind Pete McMillan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat and fastened her own belt . They reached the end of the runway and the engines idled for a few minutes . Karen knew that David and Jerry were going through their check list once more , and then the aircraft shuddered as they ran each engine separately . The passengers inside the cabin were quiet , all of them sensing that they were about to take off . Karen knew that they would not start to take off until David Brickley was as certain as any human could be that each engine would put out what was required of it , that this aircraft , so complicated in certain ways , was ready to fly . Then the engines started thundering . David released his brakes and the plane started moving slowly . Then , as the throtIles were advanced . the runway unwound under the belly of the airplane , David pulled back slightly on the yoke and they were air-borne . He lifted his hand , palm up , and Jerry sucked up the wheels . Karen released her seat bell and got out of her seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped beside the two women who had first boarded with their husbands . " May I have your tickets , please ? " Karen said . " Dick , " Ellie Charlton said . " Tickets . " " Oh , yes . Sure . " Dick Charlton reached for the tickets , tilted the magazine on his knees and the playing cards spilled on the floor of the airplane . " Oh . fine ! " Phil White said , ... " I 'm one card away from gin , and this character tips over the table . Look at this ! " He showed his hand to Karen . Karen looked at it and smiled . " Any nine , the deuce or six of hearts , any ten or queen . Quite a hand . " " Tell you what , " Phil said . " Let this joker take care of the passengers and you and 1 will play gin rummy . " Sue White said , " Pay no attention to him . Someone once told him that he looks like Jeff Chandler . Actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Ha ! " Phil said to his wife , " Do n't forget that I was at one time known as the wolf of Marin County . " " Llh-huh . " Sue said , " but time marches on . " Phil took his tickets out of his pocket and handed them to Karen . He shrugged . " She does that all the time . I wish she 'd stop reminding me . " Karen smiled and looked at the ticket . MR . AND MRS . PHILIP WHITE . She tore off the original and handed the duplicate back to Phil . " Mr. White , I believe you . I 'm absolutely terrified . " " See ! " Phil said triumphantly . " There 's a girl who knows a wolf when she sees one . " " There 's a girl , " Dick Charlton said , " who could give the State Department lessons in diplomacy . " He handed Karen his tickets . " I 'll bring some coffee before long , " Karen said . She moved down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun in a nice way . Karen always had favorites among the passengers . She decided that this trip the Charltons and the Whites were her favorites . She stopped beside the newlyweds . " May I have your tickets ? " " Oh , sure . " Roger Simpson had them ready and handed them to her . She took the ticket and read : MR . AND MRS . ROGER SIMPSON . DESTINATION : SAN FRANCISCO . " Hope you have fun , " she said . " I 'll bet you can tell , " Jill said . Karen looked al the girl and smiled . " Yes , " she said . " Yes , I can tell . So can everyone else , but do n't let it worry you . Everyone loves a honeymoon . " " I guess that 's right , " Jill said . " I wonder why ' ? " " I suppose because everyone hopes that some of that delirious happiness will rub off on him . I think it 's wonderful , anyway , Congratulations , Mr. and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Her next passenger was the marine , Blair Hanover , who was sound asleep . Karen shook him gently . He opened his eyes , looked at her , nodded and reached in his pocket for his ticket . He handed it to her , she looked at it , tore off the original and handed him his copy . He put it in his pocket , closed his eyes arrd went back to sleep . Karen smiled inwardly , wondering a bit about this man . He had flown a great deal , that was certain . Obviously an airplane trip was about as eventful as a taxi ride across town . He had the look of an old-pro jet pilot , Karen decided , and for a moment conjured up fanciful and desperate battles with MIG 's at forty thousand feet . Don 's be silly , Johnson  --  he 's probably a shoe salesman . She moved down the aisle . Then she felt a tug on her arm . She looked down into Eric 's grinning face . Karen dropped into the seat beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did n't you ? " He nodded . " I was standing a bridge watch off the coast of Brazil when Sparks brought me your tender little communique . " " And the follow-up letter ? " " Got that in Rio . " " Well , then ? " " Holy Hannah , Karen ! When I last saw you , we were engaged . Now you look at me as if I just crawled out of a hole in the ground , What happened ? " " Nothing , really . I thought things over and they did n't add up . " He peered at her . " You did n't go to that head shrinker again , did you ? The one that told you I was your father image ? What a crackpot ! " " No , I did n't go to that psychiatrist again . " " That was the craziest thing you ever did . I suppose it 's fashionable for stewardesses to be psychoanalyzed ? You need that the way I need three shoes . " Karen grinned . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Markham talked me into it . I think she had a case on him . " " Look , Karen , it is n't anyone else ? " " No , I 'd have told you It 's just ?

When I marry , I do n't intend spending my nights alone while my husband is standing a bridge watch somewhere off the coast of Brazil . " " We went all through that . My father was a sea captain , my grandfather was " I know . A sea captain , So was your great-grandfather . So go ahead and be a sea captain , but do n't expect me to be on some widow 's walk , watching the ocean . " " Sure .

" " It 'll be a great day for America when every wife is chained to a trolley that allows her to move from the bedroom to the kitchen , with slack enough in the chain so that she can reach the television set and change channels . " He grinned at her . " I think 1 ' 11 run for Congress on a ticket promising the emancipation of men . " " You do that , " she said . " In the meantime . I have work to do . I suppose you 'll want coffee ? " " Lth-huh . Make mine good and black . LIs boxheads like our coffee strong and our women weak . " Karen turned away . Directly across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window . Karen touched him on the shoulder . " Mr. McMillan , may 1 have your ticket ? " He stared at her for a moment as if he were trying to remember where he was . " Oh , yes , my ticket . " He fumbled in his pockets , finally brought out his envelope . " May I take your coat ? " Karen said . " No , " he said sharply , " I 'm quite comfortable . " " Would you like coffee later ? " " Coffee ? Oh , I suppose so . It does n't really matter . " Karen peered at the man . He seemed physically ill , but unless he asked for help , there was really nothing much that she could do . Still ? " An aspirin , perhaps . Mr. McMillan ' ? " " Aspirin ? For what ? " " I thought you might have a headache . " " I 'm perfectly all right .

There was really nothing that anyone could do . David would probably say " So what ? " Passengers , to Captain Brickley , were just something to haul around . Karen knew that . He was one pilot who refused to go back into the cabin while in the air . " My job is to sit here and get ' ern where they 're going , not to be back in the cabin chewing the rag . " She felt the airplane level off and heard the beat of the engines change . She knew that they had reached their assigned altitude , that Captain Brickley had exceeded that altitude a few hundred feet , dropped down and was now " on the step . " She also knew that he had probably engaged the automatic pilot and would want coffee . She opened the door leading to the cockpit and stopped just behind and between the two pilots . Although she was allowed , by regulations , to stay up in the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being there . The quiet and professional manner of the pilots , the whine of the hydraulic system , the maze Shin h of instruments and controls , all fascinated her because all of it was such a direct contrast to the studied luxury of the cabin . Her : the airplane was completely functional , and the men flying the airplang were In a world of their own . Only when she was with them up here did she understand a little the fascination that flying had for them . On the ground , a man could be talkative and uninhibited , and in the air a taciturn perfectionist . On the ground , she had had passes made at her by young copilots who , in the air , looked at her as if she were just another gauge to help him in flight . Only when she was up front could she understand this . " Coffee , anyone ? " she said . They both turned and looked at her , pleased with the intrusion . Once they were on autopilot , boredom set in until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Jerry Welch said . " A living , breathing angel " Even David smiled at her . " Make mine black .

" Go out and get a reputation , Junior , " Karen said , " and then ask me . " David chuckled . " There 's a girl with brains . " Jerry snorted . " Who needs brains ? " Karen smiled sweetly . " Why . very few , I guess . You seem to be doing well . " David guffawed , and Jerry waved a hand at the insult . Karen left the cockpit and , as she poured coffee for the crew , remembered that she had said nothing about Pete McMillan being aboard . She decided that she 'd mention Pete to them when she took in the coffee . She put two paper cups on a tray , added sugar and cream to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door to the flight deck and stepped inside . She handed David his coffee , then gave Jerry Welch a cup . David sipped his and nodded a silent thanks . Jerry grinned at her . " You know , Johnson , I do n't know how you resist me . " " It is n't easy , Mr. Welch , " she said . " I have to work at it all the time . " Jerry sighed and sipped his coffee . " Story of my life . " " Captain Brickley , " Karen said , " I think you should know that Pete McMillan is aboard . " " What of it ? " " He seems sick , or something . He acts ? " Then behind her she heard a voice . " No , Miss Johnson , I 'm not sick . " She turned swiftly and saw Pete McMillan standing behind her . He was still wearing his raincoat , and his right hand was in his pocket . " Mr. McMillan , " she said , " you know you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her moodily and as if he were trying to remember who she was . Then he turned his head and looked at Jerry Welch , " Hello , Jerry , " he said . " Hello , Pete , " Jerry said . " Pete , " David said , " you are n't allowed up here on the flight deck . Get out of here . " The man turned his head slowly and looked at David . " Certainly , captain . In just a few moments . " Pete 's right hand came out of his coat pocket . In the hand was an automatic pistol . Karen dropped her tray and sucked in her breath . There were no sounds in the cockpit other than those of the aircraft in flight . After Karen dropped the tray , the four of them might have been wax figures : there was so little movement . Jerry held his coffee cup halfway to his mouth . David leaned toward Pete , the hand holding the cup reaching out , as if to offer the man coffee . Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welch .

He stared at Pete for a moment , his eyes wide with shock , Ile said , " Oh , no ! You did n't ? " Then his eyes glazed and he slumped forward , dead . " You maniac ! " David said . Pete turned . " Maniac ? Yes , I believe that 's quite right , David . " The weapon , as Pete turned , was centered on the pi lot . No one in the cockpit knew whether Pete intended pulling the trigger , and David did not intend to wait , The hand holding the coffee cup moved swiftly , and the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motion of his hand , lunging for Pete McMillan 's right hand .

I 'm sorry about Captain Brickley . I did n't intend to shoot him , Do n't worry . I would n't have killed you . I have no reason . I was going to kill myself , but now I do n't have to .

The wound oozed blood and she knew dial there would be a great deal of external bleeding at the point where the bullet emerged  --  if it had  --  and probably fatal internal bleeding if it had not , She had to get the first-aid kit and morphine , and she would need help . She stood up and found that she was breathing heavily and perspiring freely .
