Biblical scholars around the world arched their eyebrows at three BBC broadcasts of British Professor John Marc Allegro of Manchester University last January ( TIME , Feb. 6 ) . Philologist Allegro , who had worked on the team deciphering the so-called Dead Sea Scrolls in Jerusalem , drew an imposing number of dramatic parallels between Jesus Christ and the Teacher of Righteousness mentioned in the scrolls of the Qumran community , which were found almost nine years ago near the Dead Sea . <P> Last week Allegro had to admit that his fascinating story was based not on facts in the Dead Sea Scrolls , but " largely on inference . All reconstructions of historical events , " said he , " are inference . " <P> In his broadcasts , Allegro had been far more assured . He spoke then of the pre-Christian Teacher 's " probable " crucifixion at the hands of the " wicked priest , " of his followers ' hope for his return to lead the " people of the New Testament , " as the Qumran community called themselves , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed so pat and Allegro so sure of himself that experts assumed that he had had access to a bombshell of a discovery . <P> Chain of Conjectures . A bombshell did indeed burst , but it was of quite a different kind . In a letter to the London Times , five scholars* currently working on the scrolls declared : <P> " In view of the broad repercussions of Allegro 's statements , and the fact that the materials on which they are based are not yet available to the public , we , his colleagues , feel obliged to make the following statement : <P> " There are no unpublished texts at the disposal of Mr. Allegro other than those of which the originals are at present in the Palestine Archaeological Museum where we are working . Upon the appearance in the press of citations from Mr. Allegro 's broadcasts we have reviewed all the pertinent materials , published and unpublished . We are unable to see in the text the ' findings ' of Mr. Allegro . <P> " We find no crucifixion of the ' teacher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken body of their Master ' to be stood guard over until Judgement Day ... It is our conviction that either he has misread the texts or he has built up a chain of conjectures which the materials do not support . "
