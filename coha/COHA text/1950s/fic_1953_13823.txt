At the rise of the curtain FRED MILLER is onnstage . He is a man in his early thirties , strong , heavy set . A round face , straight sandy hair , and very blue alert appraising eyes . He lies back in the morris chair , his feet resting on another chair , very relaxed . He is drinking coca cola from a bottle and is listening to the radio , a lonely cowboy song . When the song comes to an end , he looks at his wrist watch --  ( a new one of which he is proud - water-proof etc ) and when it is right on the minute , he turns to another station -- while he hums the song . A newscast comes on , telling the typical routine news of this day . He listens to this --  lying back in his chair , detached and disdainful . There is a knock on the center door- He turns -- listens alertly-then goes to the door and opens it . He has been waiting for this knock . ANNE BRANDT in on the threshold . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her attractiveness is a rich effulgent womanliness -- at the same time protective and  --  needing . She wears a conventional summer travelling suit -- noticeably rumpled , a hat pulled down over her eyes , soiled driving gloves , and dark glasses . She carries a large handbag . Anne Brandt is not a very clever woman . At times , especially by the very feminine questions she asks , she seems not at all clever -- rather bewildered . Her strength -- and she is strong --  lies in her common sense -- and in her deep unexpected intuitions. page no. 2 missing MILLER Sit down --  wait --  ( as she still hesitates he speaks kindly -- protectively ) You are tired . p. 3 BRANDT ( responding to this-sits ) I am . I 've been driving day and night --  no sleep -- only by the roadside --  now and then . MILLER How long ? BRANDT Ever since we left New Mexico . MILLER Does n't your husband drive ? BRANDT No . He --  can't. ( going on rapidly ) I thought we were going down to Old Mexico for our vacation But Dr. Brandt changed his mind after we got started --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you why ? BRANDT No . He never tells me why . He never explains anything to me . MILLER Why not ? BRANDT Oh --  I guess he knows I cant understand him --  but then nobody can --  except maybe Einstein or --  MILLER What did he tell you ? BRANDT Just to go on and drive and trust him . MILLER And you did . BRANDT You have to trust a great man like Dr. Brandt . You know he knows more than you . ( suddenly --  nervously ) I only know there is something wrong --  something --  p. 4 MILLER Have you a New Mexican license ? BRANDT No . Californian . He changed that too after we started . MILLER Are you sure no one followed you ? BRANDT ( surprised-alarmed ) Followed us ? no . MILLER Are you sure ? BRANDT Perfectly . There were stretches of miles across the desert where we did n't see a car ! MILLER ( crosses to center door-starts to open it -- turns ) You should n't have told me all this . BRANDT But you asked me ! MILLER I might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MILLER Leave this door ajar - so we can come in immediately . Fred goes BRANDT ( gets up --  looks around --  looks in door up right ( this is Fred 's room ) crosses - looks in door down left --  sees a narrow hall --  goes off here . HELENA comes on at outer hall door . She is a slender woman about forty  --  pale- with dark hair and eyes --  tragic looking and rather beautiful in a shabby worn down way . There is a sort of spiritual surety about her --  suffering lived through- grace . She opens the door  --  looks in -- calls " Nelly --  here Nelly " crosses to door up R --  opens this door --  calls again " Nelly -- come Nelly " Anne comes on from door D L She stops in the doorway , startled . Helena is also surprised . The two women stare at each other . p. 5 OPID Oh excuse me --  I thought this apartment was still empty . ( she speaks in a cultivated way , but with an accent ) BRANDT ( on the defensive ) What do you want ? OPID I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought she 'd come in here . BRANDT Oh ? OPID She belonged to the people who were in here before . They went off and left her . BRANDT Oh --  how cruel ! OPID Yes --  but she still wants them --  everytime she gets out she comes to this door and whimpers . You have n't seen her ? BRANDT No . OPID Then I 'm afraid she 's in heat . Well , if she is gone . ( goes to outer door- turns ) I 'm sorry to have come in like this --  but it 's nice to have met you . I 'm glad to have such a nice person for a neighbor . This is n't a very good neighborhood , as you probably know . BRANDT I 'm a stranger . OPID I 'm worse . I 'm a foreigner . I can understand your taking this place though because of the view . You can see the whole city and the sea . I would love to have it . We Poles , being land bound , long for the sight of water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just looking out.  --  My son is on the otherside there in Korea --  when I look out at the sea I feel it connects us. ( she crosses to window ) p. 6 BRANDT ( warmer ) How good that you feel it that way ! OPID How else ? BRANDT I think most mothers would say " The ocean separates us " OPID You have children , too ? BRANDT No.  --  No children . OPID Oh that is too bad . BRANDT I would n't want to have children now --  especially not a son to have to suffer all these wars ! Your son did n't have to go --  did he --  if you are foreigners ? OPID He wanted to go . BRANDT And you let him ? OPID I must . This country gave us refuge --  my son will make his life here -- he must defend it --  so that when he comes back --  ( stops ) I know what you are thinking --  if he does n't come back ! ( smiles ) He will . ( lightly ) A mother 's prayers protect him . BRANDT How good that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through every misery --  starvation --  cold -- terror . They brought us out of savagery --  into this --  this paradise --  this --  Fred appears at outer door . p. 7 OPID ( turns --  looks at him --  smiles ) Oh --  is this your husband ? MILLER ( staring at her with an empty blank look that is characteristic of him ) Who are you ? BRANDT ( as Helena does n't answer ) This is a neighbor . MILLER What does she want ? OPID I 'll be going now . Please excuse me. ( she crosses to center door --  goes . Helena off . BRANDT Where is Dr. Brandt ? MILLER Where did she come from ? BRANDT She 's a neighbor . MILLER Why did you let her in ? BRANDT She walked in . MILLER What did you tell her ? BRANDT Nothing . MILLER Why did she think I was your husband ? BRANDT Because you came in --  like that . MILLER How did she know you were married ? BRANDT I do n't know . She just did . Where is my husband ? p. 8 MILLER I do nt know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empty ? MILLER Yes . Does he know what place to come to ? BRANDT He has this number written down . MILLER You should never keep anything written . BRANDT Why not ? MILLER You should memorize and destroy everything . BRANDT I am going down to look for him ! HALLETT BRANDT comes on at center door . He is a man in his mid forties --  finely shaped head- deep set eyes --  full lipped mouth --  drooping at the corners and deeply lined . The upper part of his body is strong but he is markedly lame from one twisted leg . This contrast marks his whole personality , - frustration . He carries a thin brief case --  that seems almost empty except for a small thick bulge He appears in the doorway suddenly- and stands there clutching his briefcase --  on the defensive . BRANDT Oh Hallett --  you frightened me ! BRANDT Why so ? BRANDT Where were you ? p. 9 BRANDT In the gas station . BRANDT The gas station ? BRANDT The men 's room --  that is one of the amenities of life still allowed me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRANDT Why did n't you come back for me ? BRANDT We went for you , Hallett . He said we should n't be seen together . MILLER ( bows ) Miller --  Fred BRANDT ( surprised ) Miller ? MILLER Fred Miller . Whats wrong about that ? BRANDT Concerning the importance of my mission --  and --  what I bring --  I thought I would be received directly by a representative of the Soviets . MILLER I am that . BRANDT You are not a Russian ! MILLER I am . BRANDT You do nt look it --  or act it --  or talk it --  speak to me in Russian . MILLER ( speaks in Russian -- then ) You understand that ? p. 10 BRANDT ( now more friendly ) Yes --  somewhat --  How does it happen you speak such good English ? MILLER I speak American . BRANDT I stand corrected . How do you ? MILLER I was taught it . BRANDT Where ? MILLER In Moscow --  in special schools --  for that purpose --  where the party sent me --  from childhood .

MILLER With the ground crew at the airport . BRANDT Is n't that risky ? MILLER Risky ? I 'm a mechanic ! BRANDT I do n't mean that . I mean are there not pilots here who were in Alaska ? p. 11 MILLER In Alaska I was a Russian with a beard who could not speak English . Now I 'm a good guy called Fred .

BRANDT Till then -- I am in your hands . MILLER O.K. My first order is that you do not leave the apartment . BRANDT ( wrily ) The apartment ? You call this an apartment ? MILLER Yes . What do you call it ? BRANDT I call it a dump . MILLER Your English is still more expressive than mine . What class are you from ? Upper ? BRANDT It is not a question of my class --  its a question of my mission --  Concerning the importance of that I took it for granted I would be received decently . MILLER All the decencies are here --  luxuries ! stove , refrigerator sink --  a bath- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stand corrected .  --  I am to remain in the apartment then ? MILLER Yes . This is a military command ! I was an officer in aviation --  a captain --  it will be necessary that no one see you --  at all -- no one . BRANDT You mean --  because of this ? ( points to his foot ) MILLER Partly . But you might be recognized in any event . There is an inner room --  down that hall there --  you will remain in there . BRANDT Doing what ? MILLER ( facetious ) Growing a beard . We will reverse our techniques . BRANDT How long will it be ? MILLER The beard ? BRANDT How long must I wait ? MILLER I do n't know . The longer the wait --  the longer the beard . BRANDT ( not amused ) What are we waiting for ? MILLER The right moment . BRANDT When will that be ? MILLER I told you . I do nt know . While we are waiting you will be calle Bob . p. 14 BRANDT ( not liking it ) Bob ? Why ? MILLER Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would you like to be called ? BRANDT My name is Anne .

MILLER Temporarially you will not exist . Now --  I 'll bring up your things from your car . May I have the key ? BRANDT What about our car ? What are you going to do with it ? MILLER While we 're waiting -- I 'll find a little private garage to put it away in --  there are several in the neighborhood --  little dumps . ( laughs ) Make yourselves at home . Fred goes . BRANDT ( looking around --  uneasy- disturbed --  ) Well --  quite a let-down --  I must say ! except my being flown over !  --  That 's very gratifying ! ( as she is silent ) Well , Anna ? ( silence ) Have you nothing to say ? ( silence ) Say something ! p. 15 BRANDT ( suddenly ) Hallett !  --  what 's in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? BRANDT Let me see it . BRANDT Very well . ( opens brief case --  takes out first a small automatic revolver ) BRANDT What is that for ? Give me that ! ( Takes it quickly -- opens her hand bag -- puts it in ) BRANDT That is to protect this  --  and is no longer necessary ( takes a few papers from the case ) BRANDT And what is that ? BRANDT That , is the result of some careful measurements . BRANDT ( relieved ) Oh --  is that all ? BRANDT All ? The whole progress of mankind is just the result of some careful measurements , my dear . ( He looks at them --  begins to put them back in the brief case ) You did n't know that ? BRANDT No , Hallett --  I do n't know anything . You know that ! ( hesitates --  then ) Is it from your work at  --  p. 16 BRANDT Yes . Its concentration and culmination . ( closes case ) BRANDT ( frightened ) The new bomb then ! ( as he says nothing ) Oh Hallett ! ( more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? BRANDT I have done it . It is here . And I am here . BRANDT ( looks at him --  tears start down her cheeks ) BRANDT Is that all you have to offer me --  at this most decisive moment of my life --  tears ? tears ? BRANDT I 'm sorry Hallett. ( wipes the tears away --  speaks more composed ) It 's only such a shock to me ! You 've never given a sign that you had anything terrible like this in your mind ! Why did n't you tell me this before ? ( mounting excitement again ) Why did you let me come here --  without knowing --  without --  BRANDT You had to bring me here , Anne . I cant drive . You know that . And if I should come on a plane or a train  --  BRANDT Why did n't you tell me why ? BRANDT Because I could n't trust you . p. 17 BRANDT You know you can trust me ! BRANDT Your heart , yes . But your  --  BRANDT Do nt tell me again I 'm a fool , Hallett . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most every one is ! But  --  BRANDT You have no talent for intrigue , that 's all . BRANDT Neither have you . BRANDT At least I know if one has a secret one does n't want told --  the one to begin with is oneself .  --  Surely you must have known Have suspected something of this ! What did you think I was bringing here ? and what was I doing with it ? BRANDT I knew you were bringing something  --  somewhere --  some secret . But it never crossed my mind , Hallett --  you were a  --  ( stops ) BRANDT Yes . Go on Anne . BRANDT I thought it was something dangerous that you had found --  and you were perhaps protecting it in some way --  from misuse --  or from --  BRANDT Exactly ! That 's exactly what I am doing ! BRANDT What do you mean by that ? BRANDT Anne , men have it in their power now at this very moment --  to completely destroy not only themselves --  and all their works --  but the world itself ! p. 18 BRANDT I know all that ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every level of being . Self destruction is taking place everywhere . Do nt you see it Anne ? In only one place in the world --  one only --  are there now the forces that can keep this process in check . The Soviet Union --  There only is the discipline- the dedication --  the faith --  the strength --  that can save us --  save the world . BRANDT What about our own country ? BRANDT Our own country is the past , Anne . BRANDT But you should n't betray it ! BRANDT All those old sentimental cliches --  your mind is full of them ! Slogans --  that is what you think with ! Do nt betray your country ! Just betray humanity ! That 's what you mean , is n't it ? BRANDT Oh , Hallett , I do nt know what I mean --  I just mean your own country --  your --  BRANDT Never mind , Anne --  in twenty or thirty years there will be only one country . BRANDT ( bewildered ) You mean Russia ? BRANDT One world --  one Communist world . We live in a time of total crisis , Anne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand years of Christian civilization and enter into one diametrically different . p. 19 BRANDT You mean --  no more God ? BRANDT I mean --  no more superstition --  BRANDT Oh , Hal --  do nt talk like that ! BRANDT Why are you so , shocked ? You 're not religious . You never go to church . BRANDT I do nt go to church , but I believe in God ! BRANDT What God ? BRANDT Just God ! God , the Creator ! BRANDT ( Pointing to his briefcase ) That is God --  creating . BRANDT It 's the devil ! And you ! BRANDT Yes , God --  Devil --  Me !  - -  In one word- man ! Do you understand what I am saying with that , Anne ? BRANDT No ! Oh Hallett , do nt talk to me any more . I cant take anymore . I never understand you --  and today --  I am so tired --  and you are so irritable . Yes --  Hallett --  you 've been very irritable lately . I thought I was getting on your nerves - I always have  --  I know --  somewhat --  because I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand it , Hallett --  and I feel better --  even if --  BRANDT What do you understand ? p. 20 BRANDT You do nt feel well --  in your self , Hallett . You feel wretchod --  and so you take it out on me --  and --  BRANDT I feel well --  in myself --  as you call it --  for the first time in my life --  completely well . Because I feel freed ! From now on I cease being one of those intellectuals who flirt with revolution and violence while trying to remain chaste liberals at the same time ! From now on I live my revolutionary faith ! - I --  BRANDT At the cost of your country ! BRANDT Yes !  --  my country --  my family --  my friends --  my personal interest --  my BRANDT Oh --  Hal --  are n't you frightened ? BRANDT No ! That , too , for the first time in my life maybe . I am not afraid ! because I am not alone ! All my life I 've had to fight the sense of being absolutely alone . But now --  BRANDT I 've been there , Hallett ! BRANDT ( ignoring --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if I would keep firm in my convictions- do what I believed in -- I would in the end find other men beside me . BRANDT There were other men beside you at --  BRANDT No . I was alone . No one else was troubled --  seriously troubled --  about the terrible implications in what we were doing -- all blind in their own pride --  of science --  country --  themselves -- not one realized --  or cared --  Now I will be working with men --  awake --  alive -- alert -- men who believe as I do --  men I can communicate with --  Communism , Anna ! Communicate --  community --  that is the real meaning of the hated word we call communism . Men welded into one --  men who hold their convictions with absolute faith --  and are prepared to die for them --  men dedicated to making tomorrow . p. 21 BRANDT You mean like this man here ? BRANDT Yes . And the millions like him . BRANDT That may be all right for them , Hallett ! But for you --  it is treason ! ( as he makes an angry gesture ) Do nt you see that ? BRANDT No . BRANDT How can you not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve a cause where a supreme value is involved . So my life receives from this value --  a consecration ! As this man 's here *- as --  BRANDT You like him , Hallett ? BRANDT Yes . BRANDT But he 's not equal with you ! BRANDT Why not ? BRANDT He 's not intelligent . not --  BRANDT He is intelligent --  but unpretentious . Disciplined but warm --  warm and humorous --  BRANDT He seemed to me almost simple . BRANDT Simple but sinuous --  ascetic but --  BRANDT Ascetic ? You call this man ascetic ? p. 22 BRANDT Yes . Ascetic , but friendly --  BRANDT You do nt like him Hallett ! Not really ! But just because he 's Russian you --  BRANDT He 's the man of the future , Anne ! ( as she makes a gesture ) You do nt like him ? BRANDT No . BRANDT Why not ? BRANDT Because I cant trust him . ( suddenly --  crying out ) Oh Hal --  let 's go back ! BRANDT Back where ? BRANDT Home . BRANDT ( pause --  then ) I cant go back now , Anne . BRANDT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's our last chance . BRANDT ( shakes his head ) I 'm suspected already , Anne . I was questioned a few days before we left . I satisfied them then but that is only the beginning . The end is prison --  or --  BRANDT This is prison , Hallett . BRANDT Do you want to go , Anne ? BRANDT Go where ? p. 23 BRANDT Anywhere you want . As you said -- you can walk out now . BRANDT Alone ? BRANDT Yes . Do you want to go ? BRANDT No . BRANDT Have I convinced you , Anne ? BRANDT No . But --  I cant leave you now , Hallett --  what would you do without me --  my care and my love --  BRANDT I do nt want love --  weak --  pitying love ! I want strength- battle strength ! I want --  BRANDT Oh Hallett ! what will everyone think when we do nt come back ? We left everything just as it was --  just for a vacation ! BRANDT Bruno Pontecorvo and his wife left everything like that when they set out- with three children ! and it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spies , too ? A KNOCK on center door . Urgent . Repeated . BRANDT ( hears the knocking ) Who is it ? OPID I --  open the door --  please --  quickly --  do nt wait --  BRANDT ( points Hallett off to inner room ) I 'm coming . p. 24 BRANDT ( takes up his brief case --  clutches it to him- goes ) Hallett off down left . BRANDT ( crosses to hall door --  opens it ) ( Helena is on the threshold ) BRANDT What is it ? OPID ( frightened ) Come away ! out ! BRANDT What do you mean ? OPID The siren ! BRANDT What siren ? OPID Do nt you hear it ? BRANDT No . OPID You do nt hear a siren ? BRANDT I do nt hear anything . OPID Oh -- I 'm so sorry --  I  - -  please excuse me --  I was sure I heard it . ( comes into the room ) May I come in a moment ? just for a minute ? I 'm afraid to be alone suddenly ! If I 'm hearing things that are n't there --  ( reaches a chair --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hears sounds that are n't there --  is n't it --  very bad . BRANDT Here --  take this . ( gives her a drink of water ) p. 25 OPID ( takes it ) Thank you . ( drinks it --  hands glass back ) That was good . The water is so wonderful here in America , is n't it ? You can drink it any place ! ( gets up ) I 'm sorry to have disturbed you like this . But I was sure I heard a siren . It sounded just as they used to sound . BRANDT ( gently --  thinking Helena is --  distraught ) Where ? OPID At home . The sirens sounded just like that --  And then --  They came . BRANDT ( in the same way ) Who came ? OPID The planes ! the bombs ! BRANDT ( soothing ) No. no bombs . OPID Oh yes . First German bombs --  then English and American --  then Russian .  - -  I thought surely they were coming again . You 've never known it , have you ? BRANDT No. ( pause ) Not yet . OPID I do nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And yet --  I must ! ( looks out the window ) While my son lives --  I must live . A mother stands between her child and the dark . When she goes down into it --  he stands alone before it . And the dark is full of terror now --  too full of terror for a child --  even a grown child . ( turns back to Anne ) I 've taught my son to pray , of course , but --  ( suddenly ) Do you know what his prayer was --  as a very little child ? - He made it up himself.  --  " Please God let papa and mama and me all die from the same bomb " . ( stops --  then ) When the first planes came -- I had my husband --  but when they came again --  I was alone --  alone with my child --  and --  p. 26 BRANDT Where was your husband --  at the front ? OPID No . In a forest . BRANDT ( gently ) I do nt understand . OPID ( explaining ) A grave . A great common grave in a forest --  a community of the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ! Lie with lye --  and lies -- dead -- murdered --  ( almost matter of fact ) Do you know how the Russians do it ? BRANDT ( silently shakes her head ) OPID Always the same way --  single murders or mass murders --  a shot at the back of the head . Sometimes for a single murder they put a tennis ball in the man 's mouth first --  it is cleaner --  but for mass murders --  BRANDT How awful  --  OPID Yes . Is n't it ? And yet --  logically --  of course --  they were right . We were left an army without leaders --  just a mob . It was --  technically- a great victory . Fred comes on at center door . with one arm he carries a small travelling case- and a rug . with the other --  some packages.He stops abruptly on seeing Helena  - -  does n't speak.Then comes down to the table --  puts the things down . p. 27 OPID ( crosses to center door- turns back to Anne uneasily ) I 'll go now --  that your husband is back . I know you must want to be alone together -- so it was always -- with my husband and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MILLER Do nt let that woman in here again ! It 's dangerous ! BRANDT She is harmless --  just frightened . MILLER Frightened people are never harmless . ( he begins to undo his packages ) What was she doing here again ? BRANDT She came to warn me . MILLER Warn you ? BRANDT Yes . MILLER What about ? BRANDT She imagined she heard a siren . MILLER There was a siren . Did n't you hear it ? BRANDT No . Were there  --  planes ? MILLER Just a try-out . Not loud enough yet -- not nearly . BRANDT I did n't hear anything -- back here . MILLER No one paid any attention . Afew old women tried to find a shelter --  the old always try to save their shrivelled skins . ( takes out some of his purchases ) p. 28 BRANDT Where are the shelters ? MILLER There are n't any . A few signs --  Big ones --  phosphorescent paint --  red --  white and blue --  but no shelters . ( laughs ) Americans put their faith in advertising , you know . ( begins to check over what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRANDT Do you believe a bomb might really come here ? MILLER ( shrugs ) Why not ? The bombs they send are more terrible than any . Its only logic they 'll return --  more terrible . ( undoes more stuff ) Americans do nt reason , They are senseless --  like sheep going to the slaughter house --  cropping daisies on the way . ( counts over his stuff ) Gauze --  sterile bandages --  tape --  BRANDT What are you doing with all that ? MILLER I 'm taking it with me . BRANDT Have n't you all that --  over there ? ( as he does not answer ) You must think we are leaving soon . MILLER I do . BRANDT When ? MILLER Very soon . p. 29 BRANDT When will we know ? MILLER When I know . ( looks at watch ) Well -- its almost time for the Lone Ranger . ( goes to radio --  turns it on ) THE RADIO The Supreme Court today refused to intervene in the case of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg now in the death house in Sing Sing awaiting execution for espionage and treason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRANDT ( goes to radio --  turns it on again ) RADIO followed the conviction of Harry Gold- the atomic scientist who supplied the secret information to the Rosenbergs , through David Greenglass -- also convicted . The trial of this American Spy ring followed closely the conviction of Dr. Klaus Fuchs , the trusted atomic scientist in England who --  BRANDT Oh  --  - ( turns and runs off into inner room- door down left ) MILLER ( looks after her -- turns radio on to the Lone Ranger --  puts his drug supplies into one paper bag- then picks up his last package unopened- looks at it with a sudden tender smile  --  starts off with these into his room ) p. 30 BRANDT ( Comes back on  --  crosses to rug ) MILLER ( turning at door ) Bob all right ?

( turns away --  turns back again ) I can sleep out here if you want me to --  in the morris chair --  its quite comfortable --  Would you like that ? ( there is no answer --  she closes the door --  crosses to window --  looks out ) HALLETT comes in from door D.L. He wears the pants of the suit he had on when he came --  a soft shirt --  and a sweater . His feet in bedroom slippers . He has a two weeks beard --  and looks rumpled --  weary --  untidy . BRANDT What are you doing out here ? BRANDT ( not turning ) Looking at the moon . BRANDT The moon ? BRANDT ( nods --  still looking out ) Moonlight makes me feel I 'm hearing music --  waltz music --  BRANDT Your nature is purely sensuous --  as all womens. p. 32 BRANDT ( turning ) Oh Hal --  Did you come out here just to belittle me --  because I 'm a woman ? BRANDT No . I came out here to tell you you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I 'm all right . BRANDT Come back to bed ! ( as she shakes her head -- no ) Why not ? BRANDT You want to read . BRANDT I 'll read .

But you loathe it -- you cant bear intimacy !  - -  you - -   BRANDT Community is not intimacy --  not intimacy with a woman . BRANDT Oh Hal --  that 's horrible what you say --  You do nt love me or you could n't say a thing like that ! BRANDT That everlasting love --  that you always take refuge in ! BRANDT ( quietly ) You do not love me Hal --  You just use me  --  enslave me- Because I love you --  you know you can do what you want with me --  and so you despise me --  and p. 33 BRANDT ( kind --  almost tender ) I do not despise you , Anne ( he turns the radio on ) THE RADIO If you are irregular do not get the habit of relying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRANDT God !

This is a prison to me , Anne --  a prison where I do not even exist --  That 's a fearful feeling ,  --  to feel you do nt exist ! There 's a sort of ominousness about it --  Do nt you feel it ? BRANDT No . To me there 's a kind of --  relief --  to be another person for a while . BRANDT ( looks at her ) The role of flyer 's wife seems to suit you .

BRANDT That 's the answer you always give me ! MILLER That 's the answer . Period . BRANDT Hal is at the breaking point ! MILLER What do you mean breaking point ? BRANDT He cant go on like this ! MILLER Like what ? BRANDT Closed up in that room ! MILLER What 's wrong with that room ? It 's clean and dry . BRANDT But to be closed up in it ! for weeks ! MILLER I was closed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRANDT He does n't eat . He doesn't --  MILLER He has the best of food --  ( indicates the refrigerator ) Fit for a king ! BRANDT He does n't sleep . MILLER ( laughs ) Maybe that 's the moon . BRANDT The full moon does make him wakeful --  I 've noticed it before -- irritable --  arrogant --  perverse --  violent ! ( laughs ) p. 38 MILLER Violent ?  --  Does it do the same to you ? BRANDT No . It quiets me  --  the soft light seems to soothe me --  soothes my soul . MILLER ( smiles ) BRANDT You do nt like that kind of talk --  do you ? MILLER I do nt like sentimentality , no . BRANDT Why not ? MILLER Because it 's decadent and uncultured . All that talk of the soul ! You live in the past , Vera . BRANDT ( laughs ) I feel that same way about you . You 're the one who lives in the past !  --  the world 's already gone way beyond you .

( he goes off --  comes back immediately with another duplicate little suit case --  opens that --  takes out various bottles , etc. - finally sleeping powders ) What did you mean when you said the moon made him perverse ? BRANDT Oh oppose everything --  hate everything --  everything he really loves  --  even me --  all women ! MILLER ( still busy with his medicines ) Is he a homosexual ? BRANDT No ! What do you mean ? MILLER You said he hated women . BRANDT That is something --  from his mother . MILLER Did he hate her ? BRANDT It is because of her -- he is -- lame . MILLER How so ? BRANDT ( not liking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came home from a party --  maudlin one night and  --  MILLER Maudlin  --  you mean drunk ? BRANDT Yes . Women get drunk --  just like men --  even in the best circles . p. 40 MILLER ( nods ) Another symptom of the decay of bourgeois capitalist society . BRANDT Are there no drunken women in Russia ? MILLER Not in the best circles . If it happens it is because of ignorance and lack of culture.  --  Well what happened with the upper middle class drunken mother-and her baby ? BRANDT She dropped him on the floor --  left him there --  his leg turned under him --  whimpering the whole night . MILLER Bad. - very bad . BRANDT The father divorced her because of it --  tried to make up to him- lavished everything on him but --  MILLER Could nothing be done ? BRANDT No . Many doctors tried  --  my father was the last one . MILLER Your father ? BRANDT Yes . He was a wonderful surgeon . He was sure he could make Hallett right . He only made him worse .

MILLER Does he satisfy you , Vera ? BRANDT What do you mean ? MILLER What I ask ? Does he satisfy you ? BRANDT Do n't ask me things like that ! MILLER Why not ? BRANDT They are n't questions to be asked of any woman . MILLER They are the only questions that matter to her . A man must give a woman satisfaction --  satisfaction and children --  or she has no life . If he gives her just one -- or the other --  she can make out --  but without both --  BRANDT I love him . Does that answer you ? MILLER You love him like your child . But he is not your child . He is the father of your child --  Your man !  --  ( pause ) Have you had lovers , Vera ? BRANDT No . MILLER You will . It 's inevitable BRANDT Everything with you is always inevitable --  and simple . MILLER It is. ( hands her two sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep tonight . p. 42 BRANDT Thank you . MILLER ( packing his medicines back ) When a woman has children and is sexually satisfied by her husband -- she has no outside wishes in this line --  but with the men in your decadent society --  she has these outside wishes- and because your society has no convictions --  no solidity  --  you take these little wishes terribly seriously --  because you have nothing else to take seriously . Is n't that true ? BRANDT ( slowly ) Like everything else you say --  it is --  perhaps partly true --  but only partly ! ( excitedly ) All this rigamarole might be true about an ordinary man --  but when it 's a great man --  with a great mind --  a genius --  that a woman can look up to --  respect -- admire --  worship ! then  --  MILLER ( looks at his watch again ) Well it 's time I 'm going .

BRANDT ( coldly ) How did you happen to see him leave ? Is your hall door open all night ? OPID No . I saw him go down the street . I was looking out my window . It 's full moon tonight .

Came and stood beside my bed . And spoke to me . That 's why I came . Someone must know about it --  be a witness that I told them --  in this night -- at this hour --  my son appeared to me --  and spoke to me. ( overcome with feeling --  turns back to the window ) Something has happened out there just now --  maybe he was taken prisoner --  or even wounded . But he 's all right ! That 's what he came to tell me --  so I would n't worry --  that 's what he said . BRANDT What ? What did he say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm O.K.

OPID Just as he did the day he went away --  slender and quiet --  with the same look in his eyes he has always had --  since a child --  as if he were trying to understand something that is -- pain. p. 45 BRANDT ( gently ) Well --  now you know he is O. K. OPID Yes I do !  --  ( crosses to center door --  turns ) Thank you for letting me tell you . ( starts out --  turns back ) Write it down --  will you ? This night and this hour . Helena goes . Anne crosses slowly back to table -- starts to pick up glass she put there . Hallett comes on from inner hall . BRANDT ( crossing to radio ) Why did you let that woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time of night . BRANDT Something extraordinary had happened to her , Hallett ! She --  BRANDT I heard her --  I was by the door waiting . She had a dream -- So what ? BRANDT Talk about jeering- Hallett ! BRANDT I 'm sorry . It 's a contagious disease . ( busy with the radio ) BRANDT You do nt believe he came , Hallett ? BRANDT I do nt believe in anything supernatural . p. 46 BRANDT Why not ? BRANDT Because reason and logic forbid it . BRANDT ( impatiently --  half to herself ) Reason and logic can be blasphemy sometimes . BRANDT Oh , Anne --  try to take life as it is ! BRANDT That does n't cut out mystery ! Its all around us --  everywhere --  everything --  life --  death --  birth --  ( suddenly --  intensely ) Oh , Hallett , I wish I had a son !

( turns back to look out the window ) BRANDT ( turns the radio off --  goes away from it ) When will Fred be back --  did he say ? BRANDT He said soon . BRANDT Did he tell you where he went ? p. 47 BRANDT No . He just said he had an appointment . BRANDT He did n't tell you where ? BRANDT No . He never tells anyone anything , - you know that ! BRANDT Why is he so secretive with everyone ? BRANDT Because he does n't trust anyone . BRANDT That 's a horrible way to live ! There is no life without trust , Anne ! Just day to day living cant go on without trust ! BRANDT Youmsay that , Hallett ? BRANDT Of courss I say it ! Why not ? ( as she does not answer ) What are you trying to say to me --  that I 'm not a person to be trusted ? BRANDT ( low ) You have betrayed your trust , Hallett . BRANDT You can interpret it that way --  if you wish . BRANDT How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sacrifice the smaller for the greater . One faces that choice every day --  in everything ! Because I 've dedicated my life to a great purpose --  BRANDT What purpose ? p. 48 BRANDT The great but very simple purpose --  to make the world better . BRANDT How can you make the world better --  by making yourself worse ? ( He looks at her- struck . There is a long pause )  --  You 've become twisted , Hallett ! BRANDT You mean --  my leg ? BRANDT No ! I mean your soul ! or whatever it is -- you call it ! there 's something twisted ! BRANDT Why do you stay with me --  if you feel --  that ? BRANDT I told you - because I love you . BRANDT And I told you- I do nt want love ! It 's a vice ! Its whole aim is to appropriate the will of another --  to --  BRANDT I know --  get power over her . BRANDT ( desperately hurt ) No ! to acquire value in her eyes ! to cease being seen as ugly and cowardly !

The famous political murder was engineered with the greatest cunning and patience .  --  In order to gain access to the well guarded Trotsky --  Jackson first became the lover of Trotsky 's woman secretary .

Terror is an instrument of policy . Execution , - the highest measure of social protection . BRANDT I 'm not thinking of social protection --  nor policy --  nor history . I 'm thinking of murder ! BRANDT I know you are thinking of murder -- a dreadful murder ! But , Anne --  there is a necessity under which we all live --  every day of our lives --  the necessity to kill !  --  to live !  --  to eat ! - to defend ourselves ! Against it , our natural instinct to mercy is powerless . When you think of this one man 's death --  cruel as it was --  think of it as just a ripple on a great tide that --  BRANDT I 'm not thinking only of one man 's death --  cruel as it was --  as you say ! Nor of the agony of that death . I 'm thinking of the agony of faith betrayed !  --  the faith of a friend- the faith of a woman in love ! I 'm thinking of treachery ! the basest kind of treachery !

You used to be like that --  Hallett --  always ! I always felt you were a great man --  in every way --  and with a mind far above other men 's . And because I thought you were a great man I was willing to servo you --  and follow you . My life took a color of greatness from yours . But now you seem to me another man --  a stranger --  a Fred comes on at center door . He carries several packages-one a bottle of vodka --  well wrapped . p. 50 MILLER ( coming to table with his packages ) I 'm glad you 're up , Bob ! If not --  I 'd had to awaken you .

A very good American plane . p. 52 BRANDT How do you get it ? MILLER I take it . BRANDT Just like that ? MILLER When the moment 's right --  just like that .  --  you want a cucumber , Bob ? ( hands a cucumber to Hallett --  bites into one himself ) BRANDT You eat it just like that ? MILLER Just like that , Bob . BRANDT ( bites into his cucumber --  then ) Do you fly this plane --  alone ? MILLER You 'll know all this , Bob  --  after we take off ! BRANDT I 'd like to know it now . MILLER I cant tell you how .

MILLER Punishing , Bob --  even I say it --  punishing . Well --  a happy landing . ( they both drink ) BRANDT You 've made it many times --  did n't you say ? MILLER Many times , Bob . In many American planes --  we landed them in Russia like coming off one of your assembly lines . BRANDT No -- mishaps ? MILLER Very few . Of course the planes were brand new right out of the factory and readied by American ground crews  --  in apple pie order --  as you say . That 's a typical American phrase -- is n't it ? Bob ? Silly- when applied to a plane --  weak and confused . BRANDT The phrase --  maybe . The planes --  as you say --  not .

MILLER It will come . ( lifts his glass ) To the moment , Bob ! Down the hatch  --  for everybody . BRANDT ( gets up --  goes to door D.L. opens it -- closes it ) MILLER What 's the matter ?

Russian women are steady --  the great proletarian women --  strong , patient , and enduring . And they make sons like that .

BRANDT ( still staring out the window ) The weapons will decide . Strong people are as nothing before strong weapons . MILLER Weapons need men , Bob ! The American soldier has the finest weapons in the world in his hand --  but he does n't like to shoot ! A russian soldier shoots , Bob --  with whatever he has in his hand  --  shoots to kill !

MILLER A cultured man , then . But he did n't know Russia . BRANDT He was there . MILLER That was before the revolution then --  ( he recites a list of great power plants-factories , etc.  - -  built in so many years by so much slave labor etc- then he lifts his glass ) To the great Stalin - who gave us all this ! Our dear Comrade - dead now , but who 's fame will live forever ! Stalin !  --  the greatest statesman in the world !

But Stalin brought his people power over half the world ! Yes ! Lenin taught us --  You must hate --  and act with the greatest cunning . But the great Stalin knew more --  Hate -- act with cunning -- AND patience . Yes , Bob --  as your Red Herring said " Stalin plays for keeps " . Yes  --  my dear Red Herring  --  Comrade Stalin played for keeps ! To the Great Stalin !

Why ? BRANDT Why what ? MILLER Why do you want to go ? BRANDT Because I do nt belong here . I 'm opposed to everything here .

She carries a telegram in her hand . She stands by the door- silent- shocked and bewildered . p. 65 BRANDT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has happened ? OPID ( meaning the telegram ) This came . ( holds it out to Anne ) Read it . Please . BRANDT ( takes telegram --  starts to look at it ) OPID Out loud . Please --  I 've got to hear it . BRANDT ( reads out loud the regulation telegram announcing the death of Helena 's son ) OPID Yes . They are the same words . Just the same . ( crying out ) Do you believe them ? BRANDT ( nods ) OPID Yes --  I , too ,  --  now . When I hear them . That 's why I came --  I had to hear them ! A voice had to say them to me. ( crouches over --  holds her arms around herself ) Oh --  I must hold together . Before --  when I saw them there --  they were just some words  --  outside --  on a paper . But now that I hear them -- they have come inside me --  The words are inside me --  they get bigger and bigger --  they will break me in two ! BRANDT ( goes to her --  tries to bring her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some coffee --  p. 66 OPID ( shakes her head -- no -- crosses to window ) Thank you . BRANDT It will help you --  help your heart . OPID I have no heart . There is nothing inside me now --  just emptiness- and words . ( repeats some of the words of the message ) But he came to me last night and told me he was O.K. No --  he did n't come --  He could n't have . He was dead --  two weeks dead --  ( shudders ) BRANDT He came . You saw him ! OPID ( reasonably ) No . It was just a dream . My dream --  from my loneliness and longing . He did n't have anything to do with it . He was dead . My prayers did n't save him . How could they ? There was no one to hear them . No one . Nothing . That I thought there was someone --  that was just another dream --  of loneliness and longing . BRANDT I know how this hour must seem to you --  but it will pass --  go --  OPID Go where ? BRANDT ( radiantly ) It will change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  changes everything --  us --  and OPID ( looks at her closely ) Yes . You are changed . p. 67 BRANDT You cant believe it now -- but life will bring you happiness again !  - -  yes - -   joy ! Suddenly --  unexpectedly --  night becomes dawn --  and OPID You have a dawn in you -- a brightening --  a glow --  that secret inner glow of a woman who just comes from her lover . It is a glow that gives no warmth except to herself --  and to him . ( crosses to outer door ) I 'm going now . ( in the doorway ) Thank you for letting me hear those words . BRANDT I am sorry I could n't find other words --  to help you . OPID There are n't such words . There are only these.Thank you again for letting me hear them . BRANDT Cant you even hope that the sound of them will grow less ? OPID Yes , That is my hope now --  my only hope . Helena goes Anne goes to the door-closes it after her . Hallett comes on --  He is clean shaven and neatly dressed . BRANDT Good morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands waiting ) Sit down . The coffee is ready . I 'll make you some fresh toast . ( as he sits ) I did n't think you were awake yet . p. 68 BRANDT I 've been awake a long time --  up and dressed --  sitting on the edge of the bed . BRANDT I did n't hear you . BRANDT I was coming out --  then I heard you talking to that poor lost woman . ( gently ) Could n't you have found something to say to her , Anne --  to console her ? BRANDT What ? BRANDT ( half to himself ) Yes --  what ? with what do we console those who have lost their faith BRANDT ( after a pause ) Where did you sleep last night Anne ? BRANDT ( nods to morris chair ) There . BRANDT That was n't very comfortable , was it ? BRANDT It was all right . ( moves away to window --  looks out ) BRANDT ( looks at her back  --  then ) Fred has gone already --  I suppose . BRANDT Yes . BRANDT Come here . Sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 69 BRANDT Sit down with me anyway . BRANDT ( moves restlessly to the sink ) I want to make order . ( starts to move dishes ) BRANDT Anne --  I want to talk to you . If you will not sit down with me --  at least stand . BRANDT ( comes to table opposite him --  stands ) Well ? BRANDT I want to ask your forgiveness for last night . BRANDT Let 's not talk about it . BRANDT Please --  wait ! I must say something ! I promise to be brief --  try to understand . ( as she waits again by the table ) I do not offer this as an excuse --  just an explanation ,  --  those days in there , Anne --  alone in the wilderness- the wilderness of a closed room --  turning round and round like an animal in a trap --  a rat --  one of those operated rats that turn only in one direction --  alone with my conscience , Anne ! I --  BRANDT Alone with me ! BRANDT You were my conscience , Anne --  that is why I struggled against you . BRANDT It was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! p. 70 BRANDT Anne , I would have hated any one being there . I am a man who needs lonliness --  desperately . We all do --  but I , more than most men . I am not only a scientist , Anne --  I am a discoverer . And all discoveries --  even scientific ones --  are **25;2323;TOOLONG flashes --  out of the void --  and given only in solitude --  in loneliness . I have always --  since childhood --  had an instinctive will to protect it  --  fight for it --  because I knew BRANDT It was more than that , Hallett ! You hated me ! - as a person --  as a woman ! BRANDT Anne --  all men --  most men --  hate women- some of the time . The more they idealize them --  the more they are --  at times --  repelled by them . BRANDT Why ? BRANDT There is much that is repulsive --  about being human , Anne . We have to learn that in all life the repulsive exists --  and counts --  as all the rest . We all have to learn that . Otherwise we are lost -- in the simple misery of being human .  --   - -  I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - BRANDT Yes . Very . BRANDT But you forgave me , Anne . Because you know- instinctively --  the kind of creatures we are --  mixtures of repulsiveness and beauty -- weakness and strength , cruelty and --  p. 71 BRANDT ( to herself ) Strength ! BRANDT I did n't affront you , too much --  did I , Anne ?  --  You forgave me . BRANDT I forgave you , of course , Hal --  But something changed for me last night --  Nothing will ever be the same for me and you again . BRANDT Because of that ? BRANDT Because of everything . BRANDT What do you mean by everything ? BRANDT I mean everything that 's happened here . BRANDT Then it will be better , Anne --  much better . It will be right . For the first time --  right ! ( pause ) I have come through , Anne . BRANDT What do you mean by that ? BRANDT I am not going on . BRANDT You mean- you --  BRANDT I am going back . BRANDT Now ? BRANDT Yes . BRANDT Where ? BRANDT Back to where I started from --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh I know what the road will be --  the road to Gethsamene-with the cross at the end !  --  more terrible than that !  --  a road leading nowhere --  travelled by a man without any faith --  a few tracks in a desert --  waterless by day --  starless by night . And yet , Anne , I am not without hope . Deep within me there is something I have never known before --  call it what you will-hope -- grace --  joy- even ( pause then going on rapidly ) Because I never could accept the world I was born into --  I was always joyless , Anne . I tried to withdraw from everything that was so distasteful to me --  and I became --  empty . My hope was that when I found my world --  I would --  at last --  know  --  feel --  something of that everyday happiness other men know every day . But there was only more emptiness --  more exile ! - exile complete ! but now --  p. 72 BRANDT You cant go back , now , Hal ! BRANDT Why not ? BRANDT It 's too late ! BRANDT ( smiles ) You mean --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't answer ) You are wrong Anne . Our resurrection is our power to change . You know that , Anne ! You told this woman that ! " Everything can change for you --  " you told her " from one minute to the other ! " Yes --  this is our freedom --  This is how we can rise to life --  from death in life . BRANDT ( pause --  then going on -- almost to himself ) But --  like Job --  we must first lose all . Be submerged in remorse --  self contempt --  defeat ! And see that our defeat was due to our own insane presumption , I had the insane presumption , Anne --  to believe that I could change the world ! You opened my eyes . BRANDT I ?  --  how ? when ? BRANDT Last night . When you said " How can you make the world better --  if you make yourself worse ? " Suddenly I saw how faithless- how treacherous --  how morally corrupt I was ! And how my own corruption was making the world worse --  not better . For every man who does not keep his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , himself , increases the general destruction that is only a symptom of that sickness .  --  - And when I saw that --  I saw beyond it to the Soviet regime --  in its grim reality . I awoke from my fantastic dream of a slightly uncouth , but thoroughly lovable giant leading the world to the promises land  --  and saw instead a fearful engine of power --  Power which entirely repudiates the moral law .  --  Why did n't I see it before ? In a way I did . But I refused to believe it . Because it lay outside of anything I could admit to be possible . Because I had no religion of my own --  or only a very superficial one -- I was lost when confronted with a real one- yes a real religion based on a profound and formidable philosophy . There was nothing in me to tell me that here was the most terrible challenge that our civilization has ever had --  a challenge the more terrible because it is aided from within us by men like me --  vain -- fatuous --  blind and --  with power ! ( pause --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the arrogance , the disdain- the contempt --  the wretchedness . I was wretched , Anne . It was because of that that I took refuge in arrogance --  arrogance against everything I most valued --  You , most of all . Cant you see that , Anne ? and forgive me ? p. 73 BRANDT ( deeply troubled ) I forgive you --  of course- Hallett ! I 've told you that ! But --  BRANDT I do not ask you to go this road with me now !  --  I will not permit you to take it --  not now --  not again -- not anymore . But I must know that you still love me , Anne ! Only through that can I be able to feel that my existence now is not --  superlative .  --  ( as she makes an uncomfortable gesture ) That is not cowardice , Anne ! We are all incapable of going to the end by ourselves ! there is no meaning for one alone ! BRANDT I know that now , too , Hal . I was alone -- with you --  for years . Yes ,  --  alone . Now -- I am going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end . BRANDT ( gently ) What do you mean , Anne ? BRANDT I mean --  Fred . BRANDT Fred ? BRANDT Yes . I slept with him last night , Hallett . That is a stupid way to say it- I know . But there does n't seem to be a good way . I -- made love with him -- is that any better ? BRANDT And because of that -- you are going with him -- to the end ? Making love is not loving , Anne ! BRANDT I have to go , Hallett . Something happened forme , too --  last night . Something --  as you say --  that I never knew before . ( stops unable to express what she feels -- then ) Oh Hal -- he lifts me into another world !  --  a high- safe --  and fertile world ! no doubts -- no way to go astray -- no  --  You know it , too , Hal ! You submitted to it , too ,  - -  in another way ! p. 74 BRANDT To what ? BRANDT To his sureness ! To his strength ? BRANDT You are saying only that I was inadequate to you . BRANDT Not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighs ) We are all always inadequate- in everything -- but especially in love . BRANDT ( crying out ) There was always a cold hand over our love making , Hall- ! A blight ! A fear ! a fear of consequences !  --  But not last night ! I may have his child ! I think I have ! It could have happened ! It did ! ( Fred comes on at center door . ) MILLER ( comes on hurriedly --  crosses to his own door ) Oh Bob ! You 're out ! good ! Get your bag --  we leave immediately --  car 's downstairs . Fred off down right . BRANDT ( stands unmoving --  staring after him as though frozen ) BRANDT You heard , Anne . Get your things . BRANDT Imcant go like this ! Suddenly like this ! BRANDT Why not ? ( nods to chair where she left her coat , bag , etc the night before ) You have everything ready . p. 75 BRANDT No warning ! No --  BRANDT He warned me . BRANDT When ? BRANDT Last night . BRANDT That we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries a suit case puts it by the two small ones MILLER Bob ! get going ! BRANDT I am not going . MILLER What ? BRANDT Anne is going . She is ready . ( looks at her --  turns suddenly goes off down left ) Hallett off MILLER ( to Anna ) What does he mean --  he 's not going !  --  Did you tell him ? BRANDT Yes . MILLER Just now ! Just at this moment ! Christ ! Stupidity can do more harm than the utmost cunning ! Could n't you at least have waited ? BRANDT I did n't know we were going , Fred  --  I --  MILLER You knew I had to get him to Russia !  --  Have to ! I can not fail ! And now you bitch up everything by --  p. 76 BRANDT It was n't anything I said that changed him . He had already made up his mind . MILLER Then I 'll have to change his mind . BRANDT You cant . MILLER Why do you say that ? BRANDT I know him . MILLER But you do nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MILLER No. ( starts toward door down left ) BRANDT Leave him alone , Fred ! Do nt argue with him now ! He 's suffered enough . Let us just go ! MILLER Us ? BRANDT Yes . MILLER I 'm not taking you . BRANDT You mean you are leaving me here ? MILLER Yes . BRANDT Now ? MILLER Yes . What importance are you ? BRANDT But last night ! MILLER Last night ? BRANDT Yes . You talk as though you 'd forgotten ! p. 77 MILLER No ! I slept with you --  What about it ? BRANDT Why did you if you knew you were going ? and going to leave me ? MILLER You wanted me , did n't you ? BRANDT I thought you loved me ! MILLER Did I say that ? BRANDT No . MILLER Well then ! ( a little more gently ) Listen --  I cant take you now , Vera , - because --  BRANDT Do nt call me Vera !  --  I am Anne --  Anne Brandt ! MILLER Allright.  --  I cant take you now , Anne Brandt --  just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home --  that I do nt want any outside woman to trouble . BRANDT ( drowning- still trying to save something from her wreck ) Did n't you even want me ? MILLER I wanted you to stay here ! You had to stay here --  until we left --  Now you can go wherever you wish . But he must go with me --  BRANDT He wont go . MILLER Then his brief case must go --  must ! ( a Siren sounds ) p. 78 MILLER Christ ! - there 's the siren now ! I 'm late already ! BRANDT What siren ? MILLER Look ! Soon you 'll see them ! BRANDT What ? MILLER ( triumphant ) Planes ! Russian planes ! Russian might ! ( starts toward door down left ) BRANDT ( turns to the window ) MILLER ( starts off -- turns back --  goes to table -- picks up a small knife --  goes off with it ) Fred off down left BRANDT ( stands looking out the window  - -  gasping as though for air --  suddenly she is still --  listening . Then she turns -- stares at door down left --  then starts toward it swiftly --  stops --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it the little revolver --  goes off into the inner hall.There is the sound of her voice calling out No !  --  dont -- no ! Then three shots.She comes back on -- the revolver in her hand --  crosses to the table --  puts it down --  looks at her hand --  Hallett comes on from down left . He is clutching his brief case to his breast . BRANDT Anne . p. 79 BRANDT Is he  --  BRANDT Yes . ( as she starts toward the door ) Do nt go in there ! BRANDT But I  --  BRANDT You are useless to him now , Anne --  everything is useless to him now . ( crosses to sink -- puts his hand under the faucet ) BRANDT You are cut ! BRANDT Not deep.  --  BRANDT I 'll get something . ( goes to Fred 's bag ) He had something --  he had everything . ( opens Freds little bag --  takes out a band aid -- etc - goes to Hallett with them ) BRANDT ( watching her care for his hand ) I was trying to hold away his hand --  You came at the last right moment , Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . BRANDT No . BRANDT I heard you . BRANDT I did not call . BRANDT Are you sure ? BRANDT Quite sure . I did not want you there ! p. 80 BRANDT What was it then ? BRANDT I do not know . BRANDT But it was ! BRANDT ( slowly ) Yes . It was . But what ? ( his cut is bandaged ) Thank you , Anne . BRANDT Oh Hal --  did I do it to save you --  or because I hated him ? BRANDT Hated him ? BRANDT Yes ! Oh Hal --  tell me or I'll -- die ! ( a siren sounds ) I hear something now --  do you ? BRANDT Yes --  very loud --  just now ! BRANDT It sounded before . BRANDT I did n't hear it . BRANDT It 's a siren . BRANDT Yes . BRANDT They are coming ? BRANDT What coming BRANDT The planes ! BRANDT What planes ? BRANDT Soviet planes !  --  BRANDT Why do you say that ? p. 81 BRANDT He said it . They are coming ! BRANDT So that was his moment he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plane off the ground ! Yes ! who would stop him then-in the shock and confusion ! They may be here any moment now , Anne --  You must go ! BRANDT The car 's down stairs he said . Come --  BRANDT Not me- Anne --  You . BRANDT Why not you ? BRANDT I must remain here . BRANDT Why ? BRANDT About --  this . BRANDT There 'll be nothing left of this --  if they -- Have they the great bomb , Hal ? the terrible one ? BRANDT Yes . BRANDT Did you help them with it ? BRANDT Yes BRANDT Is that why you must stay ? BRANDT Yes . Go now , Anne ( hands her the brief case ) Take this . BRANDT Where to ? p. 82 BRANDT To where it belongs . BRANDT What shall I say ? BRANDT The truth . BRANDT Oh , Hal . I cant ! BRANDT You must !  --  for me ! The truth --  that is all I have left --  I 'll get you the keys . ( starts toward inner door ) BRANDT Oh Hal --  must you go in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner hall ) BRANDT ( puts on her hat and coat ) BRANDT ( comes back on- hands her the keys ) Here . ( hands her her bag ) BRANDT ( starts to door --  silently ) BRANDT Wait . ( she turns at door He indicates Fred 's suit cases ) BRANDT There may be something in here . Of his . That you should take , too . ( opens big bag ) No -- just his clothes . ( opens little bag -- clothes for a very small boy fall out ) p. 83 BRANDT Oh Hal ! He must have had a little child ! ( begins to cry bitterly ) BRANDT ( looks at her with pity ) Weep for him , Anne  --  and --  love him , too . BRANDT ( looks at him gratefully --  struggles for control-but her sobs increase ) BRANDT You must go now , Anne . Dry your eyes . You need clear eyes to drive your way now . BRANDT ( desperately ) Where am I driving to ? BRANDT To that land -- on the other side of despair ! ( as she makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barron land . It 's a fertile land , too . Reach it , Anne ! Pitch your tent there ! BRANDT Oh , Hal --  I cant leave you ! BRANDT You must . You must take your life in your own hands now-strongly --  whatever it may bring you.  --  We create our own fate , Anne . What is happening to you now --  that you can go-comes from everything you 've thought and done til this moment . And for me -- that I must stay- it is the same . ( desperately ) This I made , Anne ! BRANDT ( comes to him --  puts her arms around him . They embrace . Then she goes again to the door . She is going out-silently when suddenly she turns ) Oh Hal --  I never felt so near to you --  as now --  when I leave you --  never knew I loved you so  --  ( cant go on ) p. 84 BRANDT ( gently ) Perhaps that is why parting is given us ,  - -  sothat we may know -- for that one moment at least --  what love could be . ( They look into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off -- center door BRANDT ( looks at Fred 's suitcases --  then puts the child 's clothes neatly back --  closes them both -- crosses to window --  stands looking out ) ( Siren sounds ) Helena on at center door .

OPID I , too . BRANDT To die ? OPID Yes . ( comes to stand beside him by the window ) BRANDT Give me your hand . OPID ( gives him her hand ) p. 85 BRANDT How fitting that we two should die together --  we two who have lost our faith ! ( pause -- then pityingly ) Cant you still pray ? OPID ( bitterly ) To what ? BRANDT To any God . OPID ( more bitter ) The one that is coming ? BRANDT Why not ? He was the one we knew first --  the God of anger --  threat --  and terror . OPID ( proudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I am not afraid . I welcome this death that will come up this hill to take me . I welcome it -- like a son coming home to his mother . It is my death --  the death I bore within me --  mine ! BRANDT ( to himself ) I , too , welcome it --  and the fire --  the clean consuming fire --  that will take all . OPID ( pause- then ) What is this death --  that we both welcome so ? BRANDT A silence . OPID ( again bitter ) What is it silent about ? BRANDT We can not know what it is protecting --  nor what it is preparing . p. 86 OPID ( longing ) Will I see my son again ? BRANDT Perhaps . Do nt you want to pray for that ? OPID Why ? My prayers did not save him . Even his little child 's prayer was not answered --  " Oh God -- please let us all die in the same disaster " . BRANDT That prayer has been granted . It is all the same disaster . The whole world all one enormous wound . OPID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heal it ? BRANDT We do not need to look so far . There are inexhaustible consolations. in the depths of the human heart --  the divinest comfort hidden in what is human . OPID ( still bitter ) Once when bombs fell at home I saw a woman fleeing with her baby and a bundle --  saw her throw her baby away --  to save the bundle ! ( suddenly ) I must go down-there ! ( a look of tender pity comes into her face ) If it comes there may be a lost child --  who will need to hold my hand . ( lets go his hand ) Thank you . ( crosses to center door ) BRANDT Yes . Wait- Take this . ( goes to Fred 's little suit cade of medicines ) hands it to her ) p. 87 BRANDT It might --  just possibly --  help .

If it comes- I -- as you say --  must greet my death here. - my own death --  growing from my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( voice rising ) Here ! in this house !  - -  where murderers and traitors slept . OPID And if it does not come ? BRANDT Then --  more than ever --  I must be here . OPID Why ? BRANDT To give my evidence . OPID To what ? BRANDT To my truth . OPID ( starts out the door --  turns )
