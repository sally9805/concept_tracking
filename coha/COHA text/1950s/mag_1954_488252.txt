politically weak . This is not to say it is impotent . On occasion , when thoroughly aroused , the workers have effectively united for a political purpose . But such action is unfortunately the exception rather than the rule . - In practically all political elections workers must have a. score card to distinguish their friends from their enemies . No candidates belong to a party or polibcal organization around whose banner and principles labor rallies as a matter of course . This situation is largely the result of a widespread and deep-seated prejudice against direct-political action . And the prejudice in turn is a legacy of Samuel Gompers 's admonitions to workers to rely on delayed timing in political action , to gain their ends by rewarding their friends and defeating their enemies impractical method today . For these reasons American labor can usually bring no concerted pressure to bear when important issues are at stake . Whereas British labor accepts as self-evident the benefits derived from the na.r. tionalizarion of the power industry , in the United States we are finding it difficult to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is publicly owned . Even the Conservatives in England appear to embrace national health insurance Here the idea is under constant attack , and Congress has refused to permit the government to go so far as to reinsure private health-insurance plans . The British government has decided to retain full control of atomic energy , but the United States government is handing over this control to private monopolies . On all these questions as on many others the American trade unions are divided , the extent of the division varying of course from issue to issue . Handicapped further by the absence of any effective working arrangement with other groups , American labor is constrained to measure political success by negative instead of positive results . We consider it a victory today when we are able to prevent the passage of a bad law . ON THE economic front progress has been considerably faster , though by no means at express-train speed , and it was almost stopped by a business recession early this year . In June , 1954 , unemployment had reached serious proportions : three and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double the ' October 30 , 1954 number unemployed in 1953 , and these figures do not include persons working seduced hours per week . Farm income also decline in 1953 and has continued to decline so far this year . Recent legislation lowering government price supports for basic crops may mean still greater income loss . Employment in construction , finance , and government has increased over 1953 , but in mining a continuing decline now amounts to more than 12 per cent . Despite the slump in the economy , . the w unions have continued to negotiate age increases- and higher fringe benefits ; only in a few scattered instances , mostly in textiles , have there been wage reductions . Construction workers have , obtained substantial increases , but smaller ones than a year ago . The same is true of the durable-goods industries : In the paper industry increases have averaged roughly .5 cents an hour . Since the cost of living haso remained - practically unchanged during this time , the gain in teal wages is encouraging . American labor has not been able to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income . On the contrary , in terms of purchasing power , labor is not sure it can hold on to the increases won in collective bargaining . , The people of the United States are faced with a rapidly growing concentration ' of economic power  --  and hence political power . The big companies are getting bigger , and the small companies are being merged in the big companies . Already 1954 is spoken of as the Year of the Big Merger , A case in point is automobiles . The recent merger of Studebaker and Packard eliminated the last of the independents . In most other industries economic difficulties- are forcing numerous mergers . THE trade unions have had only nominal success in devising counter-measures to protect the people as a whole against this accumulating wealth and power . But the full picture is not so discouraging as some may think . Unions which have long been bitter rivals are gradually moving toward united effort in dealing with employers . Two recent examples of this are the joint negotiations in- the Meatpacking industry and a joint strike against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accord with the general understanding that the signing of the no-raid pact was really the first step toward the organic unity of the two national federations . If solidarity can be achieved , we can expect some day to see a true labor movement in the United States . On the politiCal front , when the Pal-are of the issue has made a united effort possible , it has been successful . Thus social-security benefits were increased and the so-called " millionaires ' amendment " to the tax program was defeated . The political arm of the A. F. of L. , Labor 's League for Political Education , has been expanded by the setting up of permanent regional offices with a full-time staff . Its activities have not been the deciding factor in national elections , but its success in scattered areas has amply demonstrated its potential effectiveness . The political-education program has developed a growing worker consciousness that government can render aid in an economic crisis and help cure economic ills , such as unemployment , unfair taxa-383           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
