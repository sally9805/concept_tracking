There were 22 U.S. prison riots last year , the greatest number in history . To find out why , NBC sent Walter and Peg McGraw on a four-month tour of twelve penitentiaries in seven states . The McGraws got 50 miles of tape-recorded interviews with convicts and ex-convicts , guards , wardens and state and federal penal authorities . From this mass of material they put together a nine-part radio documentary called The Challenge of Our Prisons ( Fri. 9 p.m. , NBC ) . <P> Square Shake . The McGraws ' most significant finding was that nearly all the trouble originates in state prisons , practically none in the federal penitentiaries ( " Inmates say that they get a square shake in federal . They say it does n't matter if a guard is tough as long as he is square " ) . They found that most state guards are badly underpaid and that employment turnover is high . <P> Getting ; the facts was not easy . Sanford Bates , New Jersey 's Commissioner of Institutions and Agencies , refused to let the McGraws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were interviewing ex-convicts who had served time there . Bates , a veteran administrator and onetime boss of all federal prisons , demanded and got seven minutes at the end of the show to answer the convicts ' charges . According to Peg McGraw , Bates " is a wonderful man , but he no longer follows his own theories which formed the basis of the successful federal system . He was cooperative only as long as we were doing his side of the story . " <P> Because of the vigor and colorfulness of their speech , convicts have been the stars of the first two shows . An ex-convict called " The Professor " told of his life and hard times in a succession of New Jersey reform schools and prisons , and a California-born swindler named Mac described the slow and painful process of adjusting to life in stir . This week 's show begins an investigation of the riots in the nation 's largest walled prison at Jackson , Mich. , and will be told partly in the words of Earl Ward , the psychopathic riot leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his present wife , Peg , 34 , have tried to do their present show without overt editorializing . Prison officials are given their full say , but the McGraws have had to be more selective in presenting the prisoners view point : " If only one inmate told us about a specific beef , we threw it out . But when we got the same story from a lot of inmates we were pretty sure there was some thing to it . " They have found no simple explanation for the riots . Most of the prisons are too old , too crowded and too often staffed by underpaid and inefficient guards . But there are deeper psychological reasons , and one of them is the fact that often crime does pay . According to an FBI report , only 13% of the nation 's criminals ever end up in jail . Says Peg McGraw : " The ones who do get sent up think that they are fall guys , that they were just unlucky in being put away . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
