England has not been successfully invaded since William the Conqueror rode over the luckless Saxons nine centuries ago , but the island 's invulnerability is about to end . Next month commercial television will invade staunch Britain , surging onto the air waves that have long been the placid domain of the uncommercial , unexciting BBC . <P> Through several years of debate in the newspapers and the House of Commons , citizens-mainly a mixture of Laborites , churchmen and the more conservative Britons-have been fearfully prophesying the onslaught , forecasting an instant drop of cultural standards to the twelve-year-old level that they insist television has induced in the U.S. But other millions wait like a huge fifth column , eager for the day when they can switch their allegiance and their TV dials to multichannel reception and to something more stimulating than the toneless , grey gruel fed them by the BBC . <P> Admen 's Heartburn . This week , amid the scaffolding of half-finished office buildings , in ancient music halls hastily made into studios and in smart Mayfair suites , feverish platoons of producers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admen are marshaling their forces for TV-day-Sept. 22 . Commercial television , British-style , will not start out as a replica of the American brand . By government ruling , only six minutes of sales talk will be allowed each hour , and the plugs must be concentrated at the beginning and end of the hour , or during " natural breaks " in the program . No sponsor may pick his own show : his sales message must be rotated in different spots according to the convenience of the program companies who rent TV facilities from the government 's watchdog Independent Television Authority . This has caused some heartburn among admen . Groaned one : " Suppose a cigaret commercial gets placed next to a discussion of lung cancer ! " <P> There are other limitations . Commercial TV will broadcast 52 hours a week ( compared to some 130 hours in the U.S. ) . The screen must be left blank on Sunday mornings so as not to compete with churchgoing ; no Sunday afternoon shows may be aimed at children , because they might entice them away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " toddler 's truce , " an hour of TV silence , so that parents can wring out their moppets and put them to bed . The program companies have made an unwritten agreement to limit U.S. imports to 25% of the week 's programming . But arrangements have already been made to acquaint Britons with I Love Lucy ( scheduled to compete with BBC 's prize variety hour , The Ted Ray Show ) , Dragnet , Hopalong Cassidy , Ed Murrow 's Person to Person , and Billy Graham . Last fortnight the contracts were signed for the import of Liberace , complete with candelabra and toothy smile . But many of the home-grown products will bear a resemblance to U.S. shows . Example : Sunday Night at the Palladium , featuring such stars as Gracie Fields and Johnnie Ray , will be a vaudeville hour on the lines of Ed Sullivan 's Toast of the Town . Basically , the commercial TVmen think the BBC incapable of offering them real competition .                 @ @ @ @
