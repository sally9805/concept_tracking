As the Democratic Convention began , the leader in the race for the presidential nomination was a man who kept insisting that he was not a candidate . All week long , the pressure on Illinois ' Governor Adlai Stevenson steadily increased . On Sunday , when the governor attended Chicago 's fashionable Fourth Presbyterian Church , he was the target of a sermon against indecision by the Rev. Dr. Harrison Ray Anderson . Dr. Anderson 's theme was " How Men Know God 's Will " ; his conclusion : " One must act , act , act . " <P> Heaven or Hell ? Apparently unmoved by the pleas of one &; all , Stevenson stuck to his now familiar story . While avid newsmen lay on the floor of an adjoining room eavesdropping under a heavy curtain , Stevenson told a " secret " session of the Illinois delegation that he was not " temperamentally , physically or mentally " equipped for the presidency . Insisting once again that all he wanted to be was governor of Illinois , he recalled the story of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heaven or hell . The answer : " I want to stay right here . " <P> When Stevenson had finished , chipper Chicago Boss Jack Arvey got up , undertook to answer the unspoken $64 question : Would the governor accept a draft ? Said Arvey : " I 've never spent one 3 stamp or made a telephone call asking anyone to vote for Stevenson . . . But I 'll say as long as I live that if the Democratic Party nominates Governor Stevenson , I know that in the light of his background he ca n't say no . " <P> Arvey 's speech made it clear that the Illinois delegation was prepared to ignore Stevenson 's avowed wishes and vote for him anyway . It was a move likely to have immense psychological impact on other delegates , who were sure to feel that canny Illinois politicians would not go so far out on a limb unless Stevenson would accept the nomination . It bore its first fruit the same evening when 32 Pennsylvania delegates announced that the Illinois governor was their candidate ; Kefauver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Harriman only 1 . <P> Candor &; Confession . In his speech welcoming Democratic delegates to Illinois on the convention 's opening day , Adlai Stevenson said nothing to clarify his own status , concentrated on mocking the Republicans who had left Chicago a week and a half before . Said he : " For almost a week , pompous phrases marched over this landscape in search of an idea , and the only idea they found was that the two great decades of progress under the Democratic Party were the misbegotten spawn of bungling , corruption , socialism , mismanagement , waste and worse . They captured , tied and dragged that ragged idea in here and furiously beat it to death . . . But we Democrats were not the only victims here . First the Republicans slaughtered each other and then they went after us . And the same vocabulary was good for both exercises . " <P> Stevenson urged his audience : " Where we have erred , let there be no denial ; where we have wronged the public trust , let there be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and candor and confession are good for the political soul . But we will never appease , we will never apologize for our leadership in the great events of this critical century . "
