With jets athunder , a new de Havilland Comet III , successor to the ill-starred Comet I , took off from Hatfield , north of London last week and roared 11.440 miles to Sydney , Australia in record flying time : 24 hr. 23 min .. for an average speed of about 475 m.p.h . All Britain hailed the flight as a national triumph . <P> Crowed British Overseas Airways Corp . <P> Chairman Sir Miles Thomas : " A magnificent achievement . . . Britain is maintaining her pre-eminence in the development of civil jet aviation . " Sir Miles should have known better . Since the end of World War II , Britain 's proud planemakers have claimed the sky for promising new planes , only to see one after another go down as galling and expensive flops . <P> As a result , both Britain 's military-plane program and its civilian transports are lagging far behind the U.S. <P> Last week , as the applause over the Comet showed , many were still playing what BOAC 's Sir Miles himself once condemned as " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torrents of pressagentry and hopeful prediction . Despite its good flight , the Comet III is but a prototype of a prototype that is to fly sometime in 1958 , will be both slower , smaller and shorter in range than Douglas ' DC-8 or Boeing 's 707 jet transports . <P> Bugs &; Bugs . The troubles of British aircraft are due primarily to inefficient planning , limited resources , inadequate research and development , slow and often outmoded production methods . Instead of carefully working up to advanced aircraft , British designers tried to make great leaps into supersonics , and crashed short of the mark . U.S. planemakers usually test every part of a new plane in metallurgical laboratories , wind tunnels , etc. before it flies . But British designers , partly because of a shortage of facilities , build a complete plane , skimp on preflight tests . On top of that , they generally build only one to three prototypes ; thus when a bug is discovered , the entire test program must be halted until the fault is corrected . The U.S. , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more . <P> Blame also rests on the civilian Ministry of Supply . Lacking expert knowledge of R.A.F. and airline needs , the supplymen frequently let political and economical considerations weigh too heavily . " Beyond that , the planemakers themselves are slow to improve production methods , have antiquated plants , e.g. , for a long time Vickers virtually hand-built its prize Viscount airliner ( TIME , Jan. 3 ) in converted hangars . <P> Hunter &; Javelin . As a result , the R.A.F. currently relies on U.S. F-86 Sabre jets for much of its first-line defense , while Britain 's own planes have fallen victim of one slowdown after another . Items : &lt;I The Supermarine Swift , designed by the builders of World War II 's famed Spitfire , was first ordered in 1950 . So many troubles cropped up that four versions have been scrapped ; a fifth has just been put into production only for reconnaissance . <P> &para; The Hawker Hunter , another fighter ordered in 1950 , was plagued by many bugs , e.g. , its engine surged or stalled at high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the R.A.F.
