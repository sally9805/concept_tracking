When Michael Todd 's raw and raucous Peep Show opened on Broadway a fortnight ago ( TIME , July 10 ) , Critic John Chapman of the New York Daily News wrote a balanced review , praising the show 's pretty girls but deploring Todd 's vulgarity . His verdict : an embarrassingly dirty show . To Critic Chapman 's annoyance , thick-skinned Producer Todd called up to thank him for a good box-office notice . <P> Last week , in a second column , Chapman tried again to set Todd straight . " In my first-night notice , " he wrote , " I had called Peep Show an old-fashioned stag smoker and I said I was embarrassed because I had a lady with me ... I did say the girls were numerous and beautiful , the costumes were far from numerous , scenery was lavish . . . But I was frankly relieved when my wife and Vassar daughter ... went home at the intermission . <P> " A few days before the opening . . . Mike wanted to tell me about his revue but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy to know as little as possible before the opening performance . So Todd and I chatted about stage humor and he told of his own high principles ... So I went to Peep Show . . . There came a sketch-a strip-tease number ... It was in the lowest possible taste . There was also an old burlesque number involving a girl who could twirl her breasts ... I felt sorry for the lovely young ladies of the company . . . <P> " I still do n't know who is the sucker-Todd or his public ... All I can report is that Peep Show made me feel cheap-and if this piece is another good box-office notice I shall feel cheaper still . "
