 | In winter , " said the little boy created by Robert Louis Stevenson , " I get up at night and dress by yellow candle-light . " Much of our daily routine has to be done " at night " during the winter . And a great deal of our customary daytime driving ? picking up the children after their music lessons or returning home from an afternoon of bridge ? is done after dark . We do real night driving , of course , all around the calendar : to concerts and movies , and to friends ' homes . So it 's important to realize that while night driving is not difficult , it is different in many ways from daytime driving . Driving at night presents more hazards ? for motorists , for pedestrians , and for children on bicycles ? than daytime driving . The younger members of the family , especially , should be warned that when they walk or ride their bikes at the road edge , dressed in dark clothes , they are almost invisible from a car until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the side of the road can see an oncoming car so easily that it 's hard for him to realize that the driver may not be able to see him . Nine out of ten pedestrians involved in fatal accidents are nondrivers , who probably do n't realize this fact , and the vast majority of such accidents occur at night . ) Their bicycles should always carry lights or reflectors that catch cars ' headlights . Quite naturally , your headlights are the most important factor in after-dark motoring . They should always be in proper working order , and any failure should be repaired immediately . The states that require regular car inspections always check front and rear lights , both as to operation and proper focusing . Headlights should be clean on the outside and occasionally cleaned and polished on the inside , unless your car is equipped with sealed beams , which are found on all the newer models . In these , the whole headlight is actually the bulb-a shiny reflector with fine electric filaments ? sealed so that dust and moisture ca n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the @#  | whole unit is replaced . Any garage can do this , as sealed beams are now standard In most other types of light , new bulbs can be put in if one burns out , and you might like to carry spare bulbs with you . If you want to know how to change them , consult the booklet that came with your car or ask your dealer or serviceman , because automobiles differ widely on this . All cars made today have three grades of lights : parking lights and high and low headlights . Use your parking lights for parking , for driving on brightly lighted city streets ( a law in some places ) , and in dense fog ( bright lights merely hit the fog and are reflected back at you ) . Use your low headlights for average driving around city and town , and your high ( brightest ) lights on poorly illuminated roads and in the country . Whenever you use high lights , you must lower them every time you meet another automobile . Most cars are equipped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving seldom takes you out at night , I suggest you practise using the button a bit in the daytime , to be certain you can locate and press it with your foot without a moment 's delay . @#  | Also experiment with your headlights at night , so that one glance at the road tells you , by the way the beam strikes objects beside the road , whether your lights are high or low . Or , very likely , somewhere on your dashboard a tiny light shows red when your headlights are high ; glance at this spot if you 're in doubt as to how your lights are set . Quite as important as your own headlights are those on the cars you encounter . Many drivers tell me they are bothered by the blinding glare of oncoming lights , but feel there is little to be done but endure it . You 're not nearly so helpless as that . First , you can request the approaching driver to lower his lights by blinking yours two or three times with your floor button . Incidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your lights and they are already down , it 's a good idea to have them checked , as they may be focused too high . IF LIGHTS blind you , teach yourself to look past them as they come toward you , never right into them . You can easily learn to do this , and it 's good sense , too ; after all , the right edge of the road is the most important spot for you to be sure about in night passing . Stay reasonably close to it ? about six inches away . If there 's a white line painted down the middle of the road , you may prefer to keep your eye on that . It is almost never necessary to look the approaching car right in the eyes . Experiments have proved that wearing sunglasses at night is not a good practice . While they do reduce glare , they also reduce vision . Special glasses called dimmers have recently appeared on the market . After these are adjusted to fit uour eyes , they shield the eye pupil against a beam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . They cost about two dollars . There are other ways to cut down night glare . Keep your windshield clean , so that reflections from spots do n't add to the confused aspect . Be sure your wipers are in good condition . Drive with some light on your dashboard ; this keeps your eyes adjusted to a certain amount of constant light , so that when you meet bright lights , your eye pupils are not too contracted . Having dash lights on also allows you to watch the various indicators . If you do much after-dark driving , it is especially important that your battery is operating properly ( as shown by the ammeter ) ; also , never let your gasoline supply fall too low , as few service stations stay open at night . One last precaution against the glare of lights is to slow up as you meet cars , to give your eyes more time to recover from the momentary shock . So far , I 've discussed cars coming toward you . Glare from the car behind can also be annoying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching soon pass , but on a crowded highway it 's not always possible to get away from the car behind that lights up your whole car and reflects in two mirrors . I wish people would dim their lights when they are behind another car . " There are rearview mirrors to help this problem . Some are made of special dark glass , which greatly reduces the reflection ; others can be adjusted to change the angle of the light beam . When overtaking a car at night , you can flash your lights up and down instead of using your horn , This is especially use- ful when passing a bus or truck , whose own noise may drown out the sound of your horn . Experienced drivers everywhere know that a flash from behind means " I 'm coming by . " A number of women who drive after dark have told me they like to get behind another car and follow its taillight at a reasonable distance . Especially in windy or bad weather , this can reduce the strain of night driving . Before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention a few special ones . Some are being increasingly used as regular equipment on new cars ; many can be bought and added to your present car ; others are to be carried for emergency use . Most important of the types that are built in or can be installed are directional signals , which tell the car behind you when , and which way , you are going to turn . Another is the backing light . My latest car has one , and I like it when I have to back out of a curving drive or parking place in the dark . If you do n't have a backing light , you can achieve a fair substitute by holding your foot on the brake pedal just enough to flash your rear stop lights . For possible trouble , you might carry a box of flares . They are inexpensive , burn in wind or rain , and can be placed at a distance from a stalled automobile to protect both the car and the person working on it . Various types of light plug into the cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can carry them out to the road to work by or to flag down a passer-by for help . New on the market is a glass reflector to be used if a headlight goes dead . It fastens to the burnedout light with a rubber suction cup , and reflects the lights of other cars , giving the effect of a regular headlight . A oneeyed car is always a danger on the road . BEWARE of drowsiness when you drive at night . On long trips , it 's always wise to stop after a day 's driving . Weary truck drivers may pull over to the side of the road for a nap , but that is hardly practical for a woman , especially if she is alone . If you are sleepy and must go on , see that the car is well ventilated , sing , talk to a companion , turn on the car radio to an interesting program , or try gripping the steering wheel hard . And stop at a pleasant-looking roadside place to eat and stretch . For emergency use , carry smelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep her awake for ten miles ! Most of all , night driving should be moderately paced . The experts talk about " outdriving your headlight . " This simply means going at a speed too fast to stop in the distance you can see . For instance , if your vision of the road is clear for 150 feet and you are driving at 60 miles an hour , it would take you the space of 70 feet just to put on the brake , and another 250 feet to come to a stop . That is 320 in all , or 170 feet farther than you can see ahead . Whatever is beyond your headlights is as unknown as if in daylight it were around a curve or over the top of a hill . So take your time ; relax ; enjoy the lack of traffic , the open road ; and be grateful for the comfort , convenience , and safety of a car that gets you just about any place you want to be ? day and night .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
