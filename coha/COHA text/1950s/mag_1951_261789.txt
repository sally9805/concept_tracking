The British Commonwealth makes frequent and often valid distinctions between being anti-Communist and pro-American . Last week in London , convinced that the U.S. had a bull by the tail in Korea , the Commonwealth Prime Ministers tried frantically to wiggle themselves , the U.N . and the Americans out of the pasture . The Korean problems on the Commonwealth agenda crowded out defense talks , trade negotiations , even the bitter India v. Pakistan dispute over Kashmir . <P> In the cabinet room of 10 Downing Street , in Canadian Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent 's busy suite at the Dorchester and Pandit Nehru 's quarters at Claridge 's through lunch , dinner and breakfast , the Prime Ministers filtered proposals for another compromise bid to Communist China . " We must build a bridge between East and West , " said St. Laurent . Added Nehru : " India must be a window through which the West can see the East . " <P> By week 's end even those Commonwealth members ( Canada , Australia , New Zealand , South Africa and Southern Rhodesia ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia and Lake Success through Nehru 's pink window . The proposals grew nearer and nearer to what the conferees thought China 's Red Boss Mao Tse-tung wanted . In a flurry of cables and transatlantic telephone calls , St. Laurent and Nehru worked out a new cease-fire plan for Korea . They sent instructions to their delegates on U.N . ' s Truce Committee , Canada 's Lester Pearson and India 's Sir Benegal Rau . Nehru himself hesitated at the last moment before endorsing the plan ( since a Chinese rejection would pose the implied obligation to do something about it ) , but St. Laurent finally won him over . <P> Medium or Well Done ? Pearson , Rau and Assembly President Nazrollah Entezam of Iran , the third Truce Committee member , brought the new cease-fire plan before U.N . Its first four provisions were little different from the last truce plan . They included an immediate ceasefire , withdrawal of all " non-Korean " troops , and a new Korean government " in accordance with U.N . principles . " But Paragraph Five was a stunner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Russia , the United Kingdom and the United States , immediately after the ceasefire , to settle Far Eastern problems " including , among others , those of Formosa and of representation of China in the United Nations . " <P> Two days later the U.N . ' s Political Committee voted 50-7 to send the U.N . ' s fourth cease-fire appeal to the Chinese Reds , who have not yet bothered to honor the first three . The Soviet bloc voted against the offer , because Red China and North Korea had not been invited to discuss it . El Salvador and Nationalist China also voted against it , for different reasons . T. F. Tsiang , China 's delegate , correctly described the proposal . Snapped he : " The talks will pose only one question to Peking &shy; ' How do you like Formosa &shy; rare , medium , or well done ? ' "
