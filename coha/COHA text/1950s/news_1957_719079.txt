txt Postmaster General Arthur E. Summerfield has passed the word that his department is confronted with the threat of a billion-dollar deficit . This could happen by the end of this fiscal year , if Congress should raise postal workers ' pay , as anticipated , and fail to put through a measure to increase postal revenues by increasing postage rates . This , too , seems likely . President Eisenhower , however , has indicated he will veto any pay increase legislation on the ground it would be inflatfonary . Post Office deficits are nothing new . The department ended the fiscal year last June 30 about $650,000,000 in the red . Mr. Summerfield has said that an anticipated deficit of $686 , - 000,000 for the year ending next June 30 could be cut to $269 , - 000,000 if the rate increases went through . This would be the lowest deficit in years . However , while the Postmaster General was on Capitol Hill today trying to spur the Senate into action on the rate bill , his department gave out figures that the deficit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height of $951,000,000 . This is the estimated amount the books would be unbalanced if a pay increase bill went into effect on Sept. 1 , as pending legislation provides . In the nine months from September through next June 30 the pay increase for 500,000 postal worker 's would cost $265,000,000 , This would be added to the $686,000,000 deficit already expected . Rise Approved by House The 121 per cent pay rise the House already has approved will probably be taken up by the Senate in a few days . The possibility that Post Office books might run so far out of balance was mentioned also today by Maurice H. Stans , Deputy Postmaster General in a speech in Jackson , Miss . " Unless we reverse the trend , deficits of a billicn dollars a year may soon be common , " Mr. Stans told the convention of National Rural Letter Carriers Association . Mr. Summerfield today described the deficit the post office is already confronted with this year as " an appalling matter . " " It is a frustrating matter for our 500,000 postal employes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their best efforts the Post Office department has lost $2,000,000 more in the preceding twenty-four hours , " the Cabinet official told a reporter . He has advocated higher postage rates on the ground that postal revenues might thus come closer in line with expenditures . However , on Capitol Hill it appeared he would not get his wish at this session of Congress . The House yesterday passed a bill to raise first-class letters from three to four cents an ounce , and airmail from six to seven cents . Second and third class mail  --  newspapers , magazines and advertising matter ? would also cost more under provisions of the bill . Snowland Doubts Action So far the Senate has not even held hearings on the bill , and Senator William F. Knowland , the Senate Republican /eader , said he " doubted " that with adjournment time- BO near the Senate would act this year . Senator Frank Carlson of Kansas , ranking Republican on the Senate Post Office Committee , said he was sure the committee would hold hearings before making a recommendation . Some Democrats were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postal pay raises would have a better chance of winning President Eisenhower 's approval . One stumbling block to quick Senate action , and any final Congressional enactment , appeared to be a House-approved amendment by Representative George M. Rhodes , Democrat of Pennsylvania . This was a provision to limit the mailing " subsidy " allegedly given to publishers in the second-class handling of their publications . Under the provision whenever the cost of handling the second ' class mail of any user goes $100,000 beyond the postage paid by the user , the Post Office would start billing him for the full amount of the costs . Second class mail is traditionally a money loser for the Post Office , and whether the Government should bear the difference between cost and income in the handling of newspapers and magazines as " a public service " has long been a point of controversy . Some Post Office officials were alarmed today that insertion of the Rhodes amendment might stir the controversy anew and cut off all hope of a postage rate increase soon . It was " assumed " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be heard on this one . " The pending rate bill , aside from the Rhodes amendment , raises second-class mail rates 15 per cent a year for four years ? or a total of 60 per cent by 1960 . Third class mail , most advertising matter , would be raised from 11,2 cents to 2% cents on the bulk minimum rate . Mr. Summerfield approves these increases . He said today the low second and third class rates could be blamed for the heavy deficits piled up by the Post Office Department since the end of World War II . He said that for 170 years the Post Office had operated " on a nearly break-even basis ? " but that in the twelve years since 1945 the postal deficit had totaled more than $5,000,000,000 " due primarily to the below cost postage rate paid by the large users of the mails . " " The overwhelming majority of the American people agree in poll after poll taken since 1953 by members of Congress and commercial ' organizations that postage rates should be increased and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-supporting basis , " he declared . " It is certainly time the large users of the mails who use the postal service to make a profit should pay their fair share of the cost . "
