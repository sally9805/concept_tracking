 | I was born in the Rotunda Hospital on June 5 , 1932 . There were nine children before me and twelve after me , so I myself belong to the middle group . Of this total of twenty-two , thirteen survived infancy to hold the family fort . Mine was a difficult birth , I am told . Both mother and son almost died . A whole army of relations queued up outside the hospital until the small hours of the morning , waiting for news and praying furiously that it would be good . After my birth Mother was sent off to recuperate for some weeks , and I was kept in the hospital while she was away . I remained there for some time , without name , for I was n't baptized until my mother was well enough to bring me to church . It was Mother who first saw that there was something wrong with me . I was about four months old at the time . She noticed that my head had a habit of falling backward whenever she tried to feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on the back of my neck to keep it steady . But when she took her hand away , back my head would drop again . That was the first warning sign . Then , as I got older , she became aware of other defects . She saw that my hands were clenched nearly all the time and were inclined to twine behind my back ; my mouth could n't grasp the teat of the bottle because even at that early age my jaws would either lock together tightly , so that it was impossible for her to open them , or they would suddenly become limp and fall loose , dragging my whole mouth to one side . At six months I could not sit up without having a mountain of pillows around me ; at twelve months it was the same . Almost every doctor who saw and examined  | me labeled me a very interesting but also a hopeless case . Many told Mother very gently that I was mentally defective and would remain so . That was a hard blow to a young mother who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so very sure of themselves that Mother 's faith in me seemed almost an impertinence . They assured her that nothing could be done for Inc . She refused to accept this truth ? the inevitable truth , as it then seemed ? that I was beyond cure , beyond saving , even beyond hope . She could not and would not believe that I was an imbecile as the doctors told her . She had nothing in the world to go by , not a scrap of evidence to support her conviction that , though my body was crippled , my mind was not . In spite of all the doctors and specialists told her , she would not agree . I do n't believe she knew why ? she just knew , without feeling the smallest shade of doubt . Finding that the doctors could not help in any way beyond telling her not to place her trust in me ? in other words , to forget I was a human creature and rather to regard me as just something to be fed and washed and then put away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her own hands . I was her child , and therefore part of the family . No matter how dull and incapable I might grow up to be , she was determined to treat me on the same plane as the others and not as the " queer one " in the back room who was never spoken of when there were visitors present . That was a momentous decision as far as my future life was concerned . It meant that I would always have my mother on my side to help me fight all the battles that were to come and to inspire me with new strength when I was almost beaten . But it was n't easy for her , because now the relatives and friends had decided otherwise . They contended that I should be taken kindly , sympathetically , but not seriously . That would be a mistake . " For your own sake , " they told her , " do n't look to this boy as you would to the others ; it would only break your heart in the end . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . But Mother was n't content just to say that I was not an idiot ; she set out to prove it , not because of any rigid sense of duty , but out of love . At this time she had the five other children to look after besides the " difficult one , " though as yet it was not by any means a full house . There were my brothers Jim , Tony , and Paddy . and my two sisters Lily and Mona , all of them very young , just a year or so between each of them , so that they were almost exactly like steps of stairs . Four years rolled by and I was now five , and still as helpless as a newly born baby . While my father was out at bricklaying , earning our bread and butter for us , Mother was slowly , patiently pulling down the wall , brick by brick , that seemed to  | thrust itself between me and the other children , slowly , patiently penetrating beyond the thick curtain that hung over my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heartbreaking work , for often all she got from me in return was a vague smile and perhaps a faint gurgle . I could not even mumble , nor could I sit up without support . let alone take steps . But I was n't inert or motionless . I seemed indeed to be convulsed with movement , wild , stiff snakelike movement that never left me except in sleep . My fingers twisted and twitched continually , my arms twined backward and would often shoot out suddenly , and my head lolled and sagged sideways . I was a queer , crooked little fellow . me for hours , showing me pictures out of a storybook that I had got from Santa Claus last Christmas and telling me the names of the different animals and flowers that were in them , trying without success to get me to repeat them . This had gone on while she talked and laughed with me . Then at the end of it , she leaned over and Mother tells nie how one day she had been sitting with said gently into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you like the bears and the monkeys and all the lovely flowers ? Nod your head for yes , like a good boy . " But I could make no sign that I had understood her . Her face was bent over mine hopefully . Suddenly , involuntarily , my hand reached up and grasped one of the dark curls that fell in a thick cluster about her neck . Gently she loosened the clenched fingers , though some dark strands were still clutched between them . Then she turned away from my curious stare and left the room , crying . The door closed behind her . It all seemed hopeless . It looked as though there was some justification for my relatives ' contention that I was an idiot and beyond anyone 's help . They spoke of an institution . " Never ! " said my mother almost fiercely when this was suggested to her . " It is his body that is shattered , not his mind . I 'm sure of that . " Sure ? Yet inwardly she prayed God would give her some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to believe but quite another thing to prove . I was now five , and still I showed no real sign of intel ligence . I showed no apparent interest in things except with my toes ? more especially those of my left foot . Although my natural habits were clean , I could not aid myself ; but in this respect my father took care of me . I used to lie on my back all the time in the kitchen or , on bright , warm days , out in the garden , a bundle of tortured muscles and twisted nerves , surrounded by a family that loved me and hoped for me and that made me part of their own warmth and humanity . I was lonely , imprisoned in a world of my own , unable to communicate with others , cut off , separated from them as though a glass wall stood between my existence and theirs , thrusting me beyond the sphere of their lives and activities . I longed to run about and play with the rest , but I was unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! In a moment all was changed , my future life molded into a definite shape , my mother 's faith in me rewarded and her secret fear changed into open triumph . It happened so quickly , so simply . after the years of waiting and uncertainty that I can still see and feel the whole scene as if it had happened last week . It was the afternoon of a cold , gray December day . The streets out-side  | glistened with snow ; the white , sparkling hakes stuck and melted on the windowpanes and hung on the boughs of the trees like molten silver . The wind howled dismally , whipping up little whirling columns of snow that rose and fell at every fresh gust . And over all the dull , murky sky stretched like a dark canopy , a vast infinity of grayness . Inside all the family were gathered round the kitchen fire that lit up the little room with a warm glow and made giant shadows dance on the walls and ceiling . In a corner Mona and Paddy were huddled together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing sums on an old chipped slate , using a bright piece of yellow chalk . I was close to them , propped up by a few pillows against the wall , watching . It was the chalk that attracted me so much . It was a long , slender stick of vivid yellow . It showed up so well against the black surface of the slate that I was fascinated by it as much as if it had been a stick of gold . Suddenly I wanted desperately to do what my sister was doing . Then , without thinking or knowing exactly what I was doing , I reached out and took the stick of chalk out of my sister 's hand ? with my left foot . I DO NOT know why I used my left foot to do this . It is a puzzle to many people as well as to myself , for , although I had displayed curious interest in my toes at an early age , before this I had never attempted to use either of my feet in any way . They coiald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That day , however , my left foot , apparently of its own volition , reached out and very impolitely took the chalk out of my sister 's hand . I held it tightly between my toes , and . acting on an impulse , made a wild sort of scribble with it on the slate . Next moment I stopped , a bit dazed , surprised , looking down at the stick of yellow chalk stuck between my toes , not knowing what to do with it next , hardly knowing how it got there . Then I looked up and became aware that everyone had stopped talking and was gazing at me silently . Nobody stirred . Mona , her black curls framing her chubby little face , stared at me with great big eyes and open mouth . Across the open hearth , his face lit by flames , sat my father , leaning forward , hands outspread on his knees , his shoulders tense . I felt the sweat break out on my forehead . My mother came in from the pantry with a steaming pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and . the fire , feeling the tension flowing through the room . She followed their stare . Her eyes looked from my face down to my foot , with the chalk gripped between my toes . She put down the pot . Then she crossed over to me and knelt down beside me , as she had done so many times before . " I 'll show you what to do with it , Chris , " she said very slowly , her face flushed as if with some inner excitement . Taking another piece of chalk from Mona , she hesitated , then very deliberately drew on the floor in front of me the single letter A. " Copy that , " she said , looking steadily at me . " Copy it , Christy . " I could n't . I looked about me , looked around at the faces that were turned toward me , tense , excited faces that were at that moment frozen , immobile , eager , waiting for a miracle in their midst . The stillness was profound . The room was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lulled my taut nerves into a sort of waiting sleep . I could hear the sound of the water tap dripping in the pantry , the loud ticking of the clock on the mantelshelf , and the soft hiss and crackle of the logs on the open hearth . I tried again . I put out my foot and made a wild jerking stab with the chalk , which produced a very crooked line and nothing more . Mother held the slate steady for me . " Try again , Chris , " she whispered in my ear . " Again . " I did . I stiffened my body and put my left foot out again , for the third time . I drew one side of the letter . I drew half the other side . Then the stick of chalk broke . I wanted to give up and fling it away . Then I felt my mother 's hand on my shoulder . I tried once more . Out went my foot . I shook , I sweated and strained every muscle . My hands were clenched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth so hard that I nearly pierced my lower lip . Everything in the room swam , till the faces around me were mere patches of white . But ? I drew it ? the letter A. There it was on the floor before me . Shaky , with awkward , wobbly sides and a very uneven center line . But it was the letter A. I looked up . I saw my mother 's face for a moment , tears on her cheeks . Then my father stooped down and hoisted me onto his shoulder . AVING taught me to draw the letter A with my foot , Mother next set out to teach me the whole of the alphabet in much the same way . She was determined to make use of the opportunity so miraculously presented to her and to help me communicate through the written word , if not through the spoken one . My memory of the way she set about this is quite clear . Any day she was n't too busy with the household , she would bring me up into the front bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would write down the letters on the floor with a piece of chalk . Then she would rub them out with a duster and make me write them down again from memory with the chalk held between my toes . It was hard work for both of us . I remember that the first thing I learned to write was my initials , C.B. , though I 'd often become confused and put the B before the C. Whenever anyone asked me what my name was , I 'd grab a piece of chalk and write " C.B. " with a great flourish . Soon afterward I learned to write my full name instead of just two initials . I was tremendously proud of myself when I could do this . I felt important . Soon I was able to put letters together and to form little words . After a while I began to know how to put words together and form sentences . By the time I was seven I still could not speak intelligibly , but I had a sort of grunting language that the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit up alone and crawl about on my bottom without breaking any bones or smashing any of Mother 's dishes . I wore no shoes or any other kind of footwear . My mother had tried to make me used to having my feet covered from an early age , saying I looked very much neglected barefoot . But whenever she put anything on my feet , I always kicked it off again quickly . I hated having my feet covered . When Mother put shoes or stockings on my feet , I felt as any normal person might feel if his hands were tied behind his back . AS TIME went on , I began to depend more and more on my left foot for everything . It was my main means of communication , of making myself understood to the family . It became indispensable to me . With it I learned to break down some of the barriers that stood between me and the others at home . It was the only key to the door of the prison I was in . My mother , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , was worried as to how she could best aid me to get an education . Although she was satisfied now that my mental state was quite normal , she feared that I would grow up to be illiterate and therefore at a great disadvantage intellectually as well as physically . This fear was with her almost continually . It tormented her . It was n't because of any sense of shame at the prospect of having an illiterate as well as a crippled son . She thought only of the material drawback it would mean to me when I got older . She wanted above all to make me equal with my sisters and brothers in every way possible , and as I could not go to school she did all she could to teach me herself . But she had n't much time or chance to do this daily , for she already had her hands full , struggling to carry us all through times of unemployment and illness . She found it difficult to smile at times , though she always managed to do so . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to make out words whenever I came across them . I used to try to spell out the names of the objects around me at home , like " fire , " " picture , " " dog , " " chair , " and so on . I was proud when I had mastered a new word and could write it down for Mother to show her what a great scholar I was . One day I had been trying particularly hard to master a word that was printed in Peter 's schoolbook . At last I got it and turned to Mother who was sitting in a chair by the fire nursing my baby brother . It was evening ; the dying April light made a pattern on the floor and shone on the polished top of the little table , showing up the crack that zigzagged across its surface . Tea had n't started yet , and all the others were upstairs playing a game . I sat crouched in a corner of the sofa , Peter 's book before me and a pencil in my left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealingly to where Mother sat , despairing of making this word come out by myself . But seeing her rocking gently in the chair , holding the baby closely against her breast , I had turned my face away again , feeling in a vague sort of  | way that somehow or other I must work out this one word for myself , without help . A few minutes later I gave a whoop of triumph that made Mother start and the baby stir uneasily in her arms . " What is it , Chris ? " she asked me . " You 'll waken the baby . " But I did n't care . In my own way I told her to come over to me at once . " A new word , is it ? " she asked as she came across and sat down on the edge of the sofa , the baby asleep in her arms . I grinned and , taking up the pencil , wrote down the word . When it was done , I looked up into her face for her approval and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the margin of the page . She remained so still and thoughtful for so long that I became anxious and nudged her with my foot . She turned , placed her hand upon me , and smiled . The word I had learned to write for the first time was " M-O-T-H-E-R . " I WAS now seven years old and beginning to associate with children of my own age through the help of my brothers . They took me with them when they went out to play in the streets after school , pushing me along in an old gocart , which they called my " chariot . " Some of the best years of my life were passed in that battered old crock , which creaked and groaned as they raced me along in it through lamplit streets and down dark , , murky alleys . Very soon I too had pals with whom I had fun . These were boys from our neighborhood who were young enough and frank enough to accept me without asking questions . They had grown up with me , and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would other boys who had never seen or been with me before . Some of them regarded my affliction as some odd symbol of superiority , so that they treated me with deference and respect in a strange , childish way . I had now improved a little and could sit up in the gocart without having pillows to support me . I took many a fall on those rides , as the boys pushed at full speed . I would go tumbling to the ground amid shouts and screams . But I grew to be quite hardy and became adept at falling in such a manner that all I ever got , even from a bad fall , was a bruising and a scrape or two . I got a huge thrill out of it all . The old gocart was my chariot , and I went about in it like any king . It was ugly , battered ; was forever being kicked , knocked over , shoved about , and trampled on . Everybody joked about it . But to me it was lovable , almost human . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody but I could appreciate . I called it " Henry . " From it I had my first glimpse of outdoor life . I can remember the wet wind on my face as they raced me along busy streets . I can remember resting in it as my brothers sat playing games with their pals under a street lamp on a dark winter night , when the gutters on the roads were running with water and the lamplight was reflected in them so that they looked like little rivers of gold in the dark . Old Henry was my royal throne . On it I met adventure with the others . They took me with them everywhere , even to the local cinema every weekend . I would go in perched on the back of my big brother Jim . I noticed how the other children would stare at me and how Jim would tell them to " scram , " but I did n't think too much about it . I did n't see why I should n't be perched on my brother 's back . I had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember . The summer I was eight it was too hot and sweaty for the cinema . So my brothers gave old Henry a spring cleaning and took me for long " walks " out into the Phoenix Park , where we 'd spend the day lying on the grass and then go down into Donnelly 's Hollow and light a fire and make tea in a rusty old billycan while munching sandwiches and telling stories about things that never happened till it was shadowy and time to go home . It was all great fun , going on these outings . People would sometimes stop and watch me as my brothers wheeled me along , but I did n't worry about that . I had no idea then why they stared . Perhaps I had an idea lurking at the back of my mind that there was something wrong somewhere , something about me that made people look at me in that funny way as they passed . But it was a strange idea and it frightened me , so that I tried not to think about it at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers saw to it that I was happy . ONCE they took me along to watch them swim in the canal not very far from our house . The day was warm and sultry . There was hardly any sunshine , just a heavy , oppressive warmness that seemed to make the air itself a solid palpable thing that pressed down upon you . We found a crowd of children at the canal , some swimming ; some ? mostly girls ? paddling in the shallow part , holding their skirts and pinafores high above their knees ; and others lying on the grassy bank drying themselves and throwing pebbles at one another . The air was filled with the sounds of laughter and screams as they splashed about . There were many spectators on the bridge . My two brothers placed me at a point where I could see all that went on . Then they stripped themselves under the bridge , changed into swim togs , and took a dive into the water . I looked on , amid all the noise and excitement , feeling hot , sticky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off my clothes and plunge into the water as my brothers had done . I felt as I had on that day when I first drew the letter A ? eager , unconsciously determined to do what the others were doing , to feel what they felt and know what they knew . A little while later my brother Tony climbed out on to the bank , his body glistening and his hair clinging damply to his forehead . I gave a yell , and he came to me . In my grunting language I told him I wanted to have a swim . " G'wan ? you 're kidding me ! " he said laughing . I insisted . " But you 'd drown ! " he told me . Nothing Tony said could make me less resolved to go into the water , being a fellow always willing to try anything once . " All right , then , " he said . But when my eldest brother , Jim , came over , he said he 'd have nothing to do with it . He would n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ togs then , " Tony demanded . " He ca n't go in in his pelt ! " He brought me behind a bush in a quiet part of the canal and there undressed me . Jim was large , and his togs were miles too large for me . Tony had to wrap them round a few times and pin them at the back before they 'd stay on . Finally , however , he got me ready and carried me down to the bank . He stopped and looked at me . " Still want to go in ? " he asked . " You wo n't mind if you go under and do n't come up , will you ? " I grinned . Maybe I was afraid , but I was also stubborn , too stubborn to give in now . Jim stood by , trembling . " Do n't do it ? you 'll kill him ! " he said , but we took no notice . Tony pulled a branch off a tree , dipped it into the water , and waved it over my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he caught me under the arms , hoisted me up a little , and swung me into the canal ! I gasped as I felt the cold , icy water rush over me . My brain became confused ; everything melted into a watery blur . I was beneath the water for a second , rose , went under again , rose once more , and expected to go under for the third time . But I did n't . Instead I lashed out frantically with my feet , and next thing I knew I was simply floating along like one of the white swans further up the canal . I kept kicking my feet out vigorously and remained sailing on top of the water . I heard a burst of laughter coming from the bank , and a few moments later Tony swam up beside me . He held my arm and steered me toward the towpath , where Jim hauled me ashore . I lay there panting but triumphant . " You 'd lick Christopher Columbus any day ! " said Tony , as he knelt down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had many another in a little rocky stream we discovered one summer in a wood . Often I would lie on the bank while the others were swimming or picking blackberries . Sometimes I would fall asleep there . I was happy . I looked out on the world noticing everything except myself . THEN one day my gocart broke down ; the axle snapped , the seat collapsed , and nobody could do anything with it . I was lost without it . My brothers could no longer take me with them when they went out to play . Mother talked of getting me a new cart when Father went back to work , but I hardly heard her ; I was bewildered . It was n't just that I missed the old cart so much . It was the way I felt when I could no longer go out with my brothers . Everything was changed . I was thrown upon myself at last . The notion that there was something wrong , which had entered my mind before , now loomed larger . A few days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brothers when along came some of our pals , carrying fishing nets and jam jars on a string . They suggested we should all go fishing together . It was a good day , and nobody wanted to stay at home . There was a rush for fishing rods and tackle . They crowded at the gate , ready to go . Then Tony , having forgotten something , came back for it , with a friend . When he started off again , I looked up at him dumbly , appealing silently . He stopped . This was really the first time he 'd gone anywhere important without me.  | " Sorry , Chris , " he said , turning away . " We 'll bring you back lots of pinkers . " He moved off quickly . " Pity about him ? " began his companion . Tony gave him a shove that knocked him into the road . Then they ran on to join the others . I was left alone in the garden . I looked down at my hands , twisting and twisting . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have gone sour . Now I was seldom happy . I 'd sit at the window in the kitchen and watch my brothers and their friends as they played a football match on the road outside , noticing how Peter scored goals so often . Sometimes some of them would smile and wave at me . I 'd try to wave back , but when I lifted my arm it would shoot out sideways and bang against the window frame . Then I 'd throw myself back on the sofa and bury my face in the corner of it . I was now just ten , a boy who could n't walk , talk , speak , feed , or dress himself . I was helpless , but only now did I realize to what extent . I still did n't know anything about myself ; I knew nothing beyond the fact that I was " different " from others . I did n't understand why it should be . I could n't reason it out . I could n't think clearly about it . I could only feel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thin , sharp needle that worked its way through all the fancies and dreams of my childish mind till it tore them to shreds , leaving it naked and powerless to avoid the stark reality that I was a cripple . I began to hate the sight of my wriggling hands , the sight of my wobbly head and lopsided mouth as I saw them in the mirror , so that I came to hate and fear a mirror . It told me too much . It let me see what other people saw every time they looked at me ? that when I opened my mouth it slid sideways , making me seem ugly and foolish , that when I tried to speak I only slobbered Ind gabbled , the saliva running down my chin at every word I attempted to say , that my head kept shaking and wobbling from side to side , that when I tried to smile I 'd only grimace and pucker up my eyes so that my face resembled an ugly mask . I was frightened at what I saw . AFTER a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a proper invalid chair now , that had a nice padded seat and rubber tires . " Now you can go out again , " she told me happily . My brothers , eager to show off my new wagon , as they called it , took me out into the streets once more . All our old comrades appeared , each of them taking turns at pushing me alone . That day they took me to watch them play a football game . It was like old Times , all the gang around me , telling rokes and thinking up games to play that night . But I did n't feel the same any more . r could n't laugh with them as I used to . I kept watching to see by their looks if they noticed anything peculiar about me . I hid my face whenever strangers passed by , but I knew they 'd observe my face and then my hands , and nod their heads significantly . Soon I went out no more . My brothers appealed to me again and again to join them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head and smiled at them .  | Mother tried hard to make up for it , for she saw I was lonely and knew the danger of letting loneliness stay with me . So she devised little pastimes for me , like writing out stories from the newspapers in cheap six-penny copybooks with a lead pencil held in my left foot . She 'd go over them to see if I had copied them correctly . The writing would be awful , huge , scrawling capitals sloping horizontally down the page , with no dots , dashes , or commas between them and of course no such thing as a question or exclamation mark anywhere . STILL , though it helped to lighten the days for me , it could not take away that awful , dissatisfied feeling that was beginning to take root in my heart . Writing , or rather copying , was all right ; it helped to make me interested in reading at least . But it was n't enough . I wanted something else , something that would give me a chance to expend some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental tension that welled up inside me . Then one Christmas , when I was ten , one of us ?

I was fascinated by the little solid blocks of paint ? blue , red , yellow , green , and white . Later in the day I sat and watched Paddy as he tried to make some impression on a piece of white cardboard torn from an old shoe box , but he only made a mess , and in a way I felt annoyed with him ? and a bit jealous . " I ca n't use these things ! " he said , discouraged . Pushing my box of lead soldiers toward him with my foot , I asked him , in grunts , to swap them for his paints . " Done ! " exclaimed Paddy , glad to get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away till the holiday excitement was past . Then one quiet afternoon when there was nobody in the kitchen but Mother and myself , I crawled over to the closet , opened the door with my foot , and took the little box out and laid it on the floor in front of me . " What are you up to ? " said Mother , coming over to where I squatted with my back against the wall . " Surely you 're not going to try to paint ? " I nodded solemnly . I picked up the brush between my toes , wetted it in my mouth , then rubbed it on one of the paint squares ? the bright-blue one , which I liked best . I next rubbed the brush against the other foot ? and saw a blue spot on it when I took it away . " It works ! " I managed to exclaim , and I could feel my face hot with excitement . " I 'll get you water , " said Mother , going into the pantry and coming back with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Then she brought me paper also . I dipped the brush into the water and rubbed on some vivid red paint . I steadied my foot . While Mother looked on intently , I painted on the open page before me the outline of a cross . I grinned triumphantly up at her . I remembered how , five years previously , we had sat together on the floor , almost in the same spot , while I drew with my left foot for the first time . Mother had been at my side then ; she was at my side now . There was no sweating or shaking this time . I did it quite smoothly , I was holding a paintbrush now , not a broken piece of chalk . But it meant I had discovered a new way to communicate with the outside world , a new way to talk with my left foot . As time went on I became more and more devoted to my little box of paints . I painted all sorts of crazy things , from a sketch of Peter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait of Tibby , the cat from next door . Then Mother managed to buy me more paints and brushes , along with drawing books and pencils . These broadened my range of expression and allowed me to have a greater choice of subject . After the first few weeks of uncertainty and awkwardness , I settled down contentedly with my new pastime . I painted every day upstairs in the back bedroom , completely by myself . I was changing . I did n't know it then , but I had found a way to be happy again and to forget some of the things that had made me unhappy . Above all I learned to forget myself . I did n't miss going out with my brothers now , for I had something to keep my mind active , something to make each day a thing to look forward to . I would sit on the floor for hours , holding the brush between my toes , my right leg curled up under my left , my arms held tightly at my sides , the hands clenched . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get Mother or Father to pin the drawing paper to the floor with tacks to keep it steady . It looked to be an awkward position , with my head almost between my knees and my back as crooked as a corkscrew . But I painted m best pictures in this way , with the wooden floor as my easel . Slowly I began to lose my sense of depression . I felt pure joy while I painted . I had never experienced it before . It seemed to lift me above myself . It was only when I was n't painting that I became cross with everybody at home . THIS was the point at which Katriona Delahunt came into my life . Mother was ill at the Rotunda Hospital ; we were all worried about her . It was a cold night , and I was huddled on the sofa . The door opened and I heard Father and someone else come into the kitchen . " This is Christy , " Father said . Then I heard a girl 's voice saying , " Is he asleep ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitor , blinking a little . The light was n't on yet , and the room was dusky , but by the light of the street lamp outside I saw that my visitor was a young girl , perhaps about eighteen . She was slim and tall and lovely ? the most beautiful girl I had ever seen . " Hello , " she said , smiling a lovely smile . " My name is Miss Delahunt . Your mother told me about you . " I tried to say something , but I only made the same sound I always made when I tried to speak . The girl smiled and sat down on the edge of the sofa . " I thought I 'd call and meet you , " she said . " You do n't mind , do you ? " I shook my head vigorously . Then she told me she was an almoner 's student at the Rotunda Hospital , that she had met Mother and heard about me and how I painted with my left foot and had wanted to meet me . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how we were getting on at home  | without her , so the girl had decided to come out and get me to write Mother a little note , " Will you do that for me ? " she asked . I could n't refuse . Father lifted me on to the table , and , holding the pencil between my toes , I wrote on the back of an old envelope : " Dear Mom , Do n't worry . All okay . Lots of grub . Get well soon . Christy . " I did n't want to put any kisses at the end of it , but Katriona told me it would look better if I did , so I scrawled one big kiss in the corner of the envelope and gave it to her . Next time she came she brought me a great supply of new paints , brushes , and drawing books , along with the good news that Mother was improving and soon would be home . Katriona Delahunt came into my life at a time when I most needed someone like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would make me realize the necessity of trying to rise above the ordinary standard of thought and activity around me and so help attain a securer balance within myself . Apart from Mother , she was to be my greatest inspiration in the years and the struggles that lay before me . But of course I did n't know all this at eleven years old . I only knew that I had met my first dream girl . ONE morning a few weeks before Christmas , I was flicking over the pages of the Sunday Independent with my foot when I saw the announcement of a Christmas painting competition for children from twelve to sixteen . I was just a little past twelve , so I was , quite eligible to enter . It was a Sunday morning , the others were out at Mass , and Mother was in the pantry preparing dinner while Father read his paper . I studied the announcement again . There was an ordinary black-and-white reproduction of the picture that had to be colored , showing a gay ballroom scene and Cinderella dancing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by the other dancers , all in elegant costumes , the men in skintight stockings and doublets and the ladies in flowing skirts . Over their heads swung huge chandeliers . I thought it would be a good picture to paint , and I was so attracted by it that I seemed to see it all finished and glowing with color as I stared at it . saw it all so plainly that I felt I had already done it . I called Mother from the pantry and showed her the news about the competition . " Try it , " she said . I shook my head and mumbled something about not being good enough . " That 's silly , " said Mother . " You do n't have to be a genius . Just try . " I did . I painted the picture that same afternoon , and I did it better than I thought I would . I paid Cinderella special attention . I made her quite a glamour girl , with pink cheeks , golden ringlets , a beautiful blue dress . Her white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted Prince Charming 's uniform a bright purple , and as an artistic touch decided to bespatter it with tiny spots of yellow in imitation of gems . I painted their eyes blue , though I put a spot of green in the Prince 's . I was satisfied when I had finished the picture . I did n't want to have anything  | to do with the competition itself , because I did n't think I stood a chance . But although I could refuse to listen to Mother , I could n't refuse to do whatever my " dream girl " asked me ; and when Mother told her about the competition and showed her the picture I had finished , Miss Delahunt said I should enter it without delay . To me it was an ultimatum . I went more carefully over the picture , adding touches here and there . Then I got Mother to seal , stamp , and post it away to the newspaper offices the next day . I really thought it was a waste of time . I had n't a hope in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went back to painting in the ordinary way all that week , happy at least that I had pleased Miss Delahunt . On the following Friday morning Mother answered the door and found it was a newspaper reporter , along with a photographer from the Independent , who had come to see me . Without my knowing it , Miss Delahunt had gone to the newspaper people and told them that one of the pictures sent in to their office was done by a boy who painted with his toes . The next Sunday morning I was lying cozily in bed with Peter , halfway between sleep and wakefulness , when Father ran up the stairs , burst into the room , and pulled me up into a sitting position . " Look ? look ! " he said , waving a copy of the Sunday Independent before my face . " See , you 've won ! " It was true . There was the photograph they had taken of me the previous Friday . In it was a little boy in short trousers , his thin legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by his side one twisted hand held tight to keep it still . I was brought down to the kitchen where all the family were eating breakfast and talking excitedly about my success . Mother laid down the teapot she was holding and came up to me as Father held me in his arms . " Never stop trying , Chris , " she said , and kissed me . THIRTEEN ? and painting was everything to me . I did n't go out at all now . I did n't even play in the house with my brothers any more . This bothered them at first , but they accepted the new kind of relationship that had developed between us . I did n't become a stranger to the family , of course , because with so many of us living together that was impossible ; we all formed part of one another , so to speak . But I had come to live more within myself . I lived with the others , but at the same time I lived apart from them , apart from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawn as I was from the ordinary pursuits of a boy , the life of the streets and back alleys , I found that my heart was far ahead of my body in growth and development ; I lost it again , good and truly this time . Another " dream girl " had come into my vision , not as tall and beautiful as my old one but more my own age . She was called Jenny . She lived a few doors away from my house . She was small , energetic , gay , with brown curls framing her elfin face with its lively green eyes and pouting lips . Jenny was a coquette ; she could start a riot among the boys on our street merely by rolling her lovely eyes . They were all crazy about her , and there were many fights about who would marry her when they grew up . I worshiped Jenny from afar ? that is , from my bedroom window . It made me lazy in my painting , for whenever I heard her voice I 'd crawl over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her as she skipped about with the other girls , whom I did n't notice at all . One day she looked up and saw me . She smiled . I managed to smile back , and then she blew me a kiss . I could hardly believe my eyes , but she did it again before running away . That night I wrote a note to Jenny , which I got one of my younger brothers to deliver , threatening him with my foot if he did n't give it to Jenny herself . told her I thought she was the prettiest girl on our street and that I 'd paint her lots of pictures if she 'd let me . In excitement and fear I waited for my brother to come back . In half an hour 's time he returned ? with a note from her . I read the note eagerly , read it over and over again , especially the line that said she 'd come and see me in my back yard the next day . There was a fluttering inside me and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jenny was very sweet . We looked over some of my paintings , and she gave a gasp of admiration at each one showed her . I was shy and awkward at first because of my slurred speech and the way I used my foot instead of my hands . But Jenny was a very tactful child ; she seemed to notice nothing strange about me but talked gaily about games and parties and the boy next door the same as if I had been Peter or Paddy . I liked her for that . We became good friends . We never said a great deal , but we exchanged innumerable little notes each week , and she 'd come over to see me every Saturday night , bringing me books or magazines . I was secretly proud that I , a cripple , had made friends with the most sought-after girl in our neighborhood . I often heard Peter say fervently that he 'd do anything to be her favorite " beau . " One Saturday he came upon Jenny and me as we sat together in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old storybook that Jenny had brought along . I got red in the face , but Jenny did n't move ; she just lifted her head , smiled at my brother briefly , and bent over the book again . Peter gave me a mean look and went into the house , banging the door after him . That evening , before she left , Jenny sat very quietly , toying idly with the book , a little frown creasing her forehead and her lower lip pushed out , as she always looked when she wanted to say something difficult . Then she got up , hesitated , suddenly knelt down beside me , and kissed me on the forehead . She had never kissed me before . I tried to say something , but Jenny sprang to her feet , her eyes wet with tears , and rushed away , her small black shoes clattering noisily as she ran down the path and into the street . JENNY did n't come for weeks after this , and I did n't hear from her , although I fairly bombarded her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , thinking of her and that special moment in the back yard . I felt melancholy and alone . Why does n't she come ? I asked myself . Why ? Then one afternoon as I sat disconsolate ,  | I heard a step close by , and it was Jenny She stood a few feet away , at the entrance to the yard , her slim , childish figure outlined against the white wall behind her , vividly bright in the June sunshine . She was looking across at me , and her look was a look of pity . I knew then , as I came to know many times later , how bitter and crushing the simple mien of pity can be to someone who needs something other than sympathy ? the strength that only genuine human affection can give . I lowered my head under her gaze , and without a word being said on either side Jenny turned slowly and left me to myself . I became different after that . For a few blissful weeks I had allowed myself to dream that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in love " with the sweetest girl in the world and who was foolish enough to think that she cared for him in return . Now all that fantasy was at an end , and bitter was the realization that I had tricked myself into believing that my affliction did n't matter . I saw what a fool I had been to deceive myself so completely . I did n't see Jenny again until my fifteenth birthday had come around and Mother managed to give a party . It was a ; . y turnout , and some of my old pals came along . Unknown to me , my sister Mona had invited Jenny . But she was of the small , freckle-faced Jenny I had known in our back yard romance but a lovely sweet sixteen , a smiling young girl in a gray satin frock , her nails polished and her dark hair scented . I looked at her across the table , and our eyes met . But whatever little resemblance she had to the old Jenny vanished the next moment when she came over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitation or shyness . " How are you , Christy , well ? " she asked me in a half-frolicsome , halfplacating way . " Yes , yes , that 's good , do n't excite yourself , " she said soothingly as I strove to say something . I almost hated her for that . After the party was over and they had all gone , Mother asked me if I had enjoyed it . I told her I had , but I had not . My head was aching . Worse than the headache , worse than anything else , was the heartache . I knew I was a child no longer , but neither was I " grown-up . " I was poised between the blissful ignorance of childhood and the awakening pain and frustration of adolescence . I longed to be ignorant and happy as before . But I knew my childhood had gone . IN ADOLESCENCE I could no longer run away from myself . In a thousand ways , large and small , as each day went by , I saw and felt the limitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were a few memorable experiences ? I made a pilgrimage to Lourdes , and once I came perilously close to hurling myself out of a bedroom window , after writing a note that began , " To Whom It May Concern , knowing nobody is concerned ? " but mostly I was left with nothing but frustration . Around me everywhere were signs of activity , effort , growth . All had something to do , something to occupy them and keep their minds and their hands active . I had only my left foot . Mother was never anything but a tremendous well of inspiration to me , but now we did n't always agree with  | each other . We had quarrels ; the only thing I could say plainly and without difficulty was " Go to hell , " and I sometimes said it to Mother when I was in a temper ! Speech was an awkward effort with me , but I did n't need words for Mother to know what was going on inside me . I believe she could read my thoughts . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make the one wince merely at what the other felt . I went on painting my little water colors , painting what I had never seen but only imagined ? distant landscapes , ships , a pond in a park . But now even painting had changed . It could n't satisfy me any more . I still liked it , but I had ceased to love it . There was some new energy in me , some new need that could n't be expressed . I needed something else , some broader medium to speak through . I became fairly desperate . I could n't speak with my lips , and now I could n't speak through painting either . AFTER some months another feeling sprang up ? a horrible feeling . I began to be not merely miserable and gloomy but also resentful . I resented the world because of my crooked mouth , my useless limbs . I viewed all that was normal and perfect around me and asked myself always why I was made different , why I had been given the same emotions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only denied me the right to live a normal life but also made me ill at the very sight of myself ? What had I to look forward to ? What prospect had I of being other than a freak who painted with his toes ? People always thought it was marvelous that I could paint with my toes and told me I was a fortunate , yes , quite remarkable boy ! But what difference did painting with my left foot make ? What good was there in being remarkable ? I only wanted to be ordinary . Because I did with my left foot what others did with their hands , people said , " How wonderful ! " I used my foot simply because I could n't use my hands . It did not make me feel proud . In fact I never used my foot in the presence of anybody I did n't know well , because it made me feel silly and awkward . I always felt like a performing monkey or seal . Then one day I had an idea . I had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to try something more ambitious , not just letters but stories . The idea grew and grew until it possessed my whole mind . From then on writing became my only real interest . Just as the paintbrush used to be my scepter , so now a pencil was seldom out of my foot . I wrote stories about the American wild West , made up of tremendous physical action and rolling wagons . These were mostly based on memories of days at the " pictures . " The characters in them were tobacco-chewing , gun-slinging men who rode all day and drank all night , and girls with streamlined figures and roving eyes who never seemed to do anything but kick up their legs and drink . I attempted detective " thrillers " in which violence and death abounded . I murdered my characters in the stickiest way possible . Shooting them was n't enough . I sliced them into little pieces . I do n't think I was happy , even then , but at least I was better occupied . I had found a way to relieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening a bottle of ginger pop and letting the pent-up bubbles escape . I felt life had become a little less stuffy . But always , whatever I did , wherever I turned , I was lonely and restless . As my mind developed , I grew more conscious of my body till the knowledge of its disabilities was enough to give me a physical sense of pain . What had been petulance before , now became melancholy . I wanted friends , people of my own age to go about with . I realized that the friendly ties I had formed in childhood were now broken by the rift that adolescence had wrought between myself and those I had played with . It seemed that instead of coming to a better understanding of my handicap I only became more troubled and bitterer as I grew older . On the night of my seventeenth birthday I managed to make my way out into the back garden . I was hot and wanted fresh air . I crawled over and sat under a tree . It was June ; the air was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful night , calm , gentle . The moonlight made everything seem all silver . I almost imagined I heard the noise of the stars as they glimmered in the dark sky . For a moment I was happy . Then I remembered . The future was only a black pit before me . What was I ? I asked myself as I sat there . Just one of God 's practical jokes ! My life seemed patternless , without purpose or worth . I was imprisoned within the walls that I now felt closing in around me as I grew up . I longed terribly to be free ; I longed passionately to break loose and escape . RESCUE from this nadir of despair came quietly and suddenly . It was the week after I had returned from Lourdes , uncured and more disillusioned than ever . I was sitting at my window contemplating the gathering autumn dusk . In the kitchen behind me I could hear the sausages frizzling in the pan as Mother got the dinner ready , with all the children chattering and crowding around her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powdering her nose , preparing for a dance as usual , while Peter seemed well pleased with himself , polishing his shoes vigorously and giving me a wink , a sure sign that he had a date . From the corner of my eye then I saw the headlights of a car piercing the deepening twilight as it came round the bend in the road opposite . It disappeared behind some bushes , but in a second came in sight again and stopped outside our door . A man stepped out , paused to peer uncertainly at the number of the house , then , apparently satisfied , opened the front gate and came up the steps . Hearing the knock , Mother went to answer it . I heard her speaking to someone at the hall door , and a moment later she came back into the kitchen with a strange man . " This is Christy , " she told him as they entered . He sat down on a chair close by and told me he was a doctor who had seen me as a child at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed me on the back of my brother . He had n't forgotten me , and had started to look for me a few days ago . Then he rose , paced up and down thoughtfully for a few moments , and finally sat on the edge of the table , his arms folded . " Christy , " he said in a deep , pleasant voice , " there is a new treatment for cerebral palsy , the thing that is wrong with you . I believe you can be helped ? but only if you are willing to try hard enough with us . I ca n't help you if you do n't try to help yourself . You must want to get better before anything can be done for you . " Then he leaned forward , his eyes steady on me . " Will you try if I help ? " he asked me . Will I try ! I thought . I could n't speak , so I could n't answer him . I could only stare . But he must have read the message in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put his arm around my shoulders . " Right ! We 'll start tomorrow . " He said he would send one of his assistants to examine me and devise a special line of treatment , as the method was to treat each patient individually rather than in the mass . I would be treated at home ; they had n't yet formed a special clinic of their own . As he was going out the door he turned around . " My name 's Dr. Collis , " he said to me with a smile . " I 'll be seeing you . " As the door closed upon him , I saw the faces around me . They were bright with happiness . Father was so overjoyed that his hand trembled as he poured me a cup of tea . For a moment Mona had forgotten her dance and was smiling at me while she absently crushed her powder puff in her hand . Peter , good old Peter , said later he put salt instead of sugar into his tea . But it was Mother I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was feeling at any time , but there was a quiet air of joy about her , a subdued glow in her face that meant more to me than if she had thrown her arms about me and wept with thanksgiving . And I ? what did I feel at that moment of my life , the moment I had so longed for and dreamed about ever since I had begun to feel and dream ? I did n't feel or think of anything . My senses were numbed . I could n't quite grasp , I could n't believe , the idea that I was to be helped at last . It was much later , as I sat around the fire with Mother and Father when the others had gone out to enjoy themselves , that I began to think about the news I had heard that day , and only then did the reality and truth of it come to my mind . I do n't think I was excited in the ordinary way about it as the rest of the family had been ? I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . And that night , before I went to sleep , I prayed a prayer of thankfulness ? and repentance for having doubted . THE DOCTOR who came next day to examine me was a young man , tall , with a military bearing that impressed even while it subdued me a little . He was slow and deliberate in his movements . His manner suggested an easy confidence that communicated itself to those about him . I felt myself liking him at once . His name was Louis Warnants . I shall always remember it with gratitude and affection . Dr. Warnants drew up a special line of treatment that concerned itself primarily at first with certain physical exercises that I could carry out myself with perhaps a little help from the family if 1 wanted it . But exercising in the limited  | space of our living room was a problem . Mother wanted to build me a little house of bricks in the small back yard , but the bricklayers in the family did n't think that feasible and said it would be expensive , and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought we might wait a while . But they had reckoned without Mother . Mother raised money to buy building materials ? borrowing , selling , visiting the good old pawnshop . One day I became aware of new sounds coming from the back garden . I stumbled to the pantry window . There was Mother , on her knees on the grass , a bucket of cement on one side of her , a jug of water on the other . She held a trowel in her right hand . She was viewing proudly the line of blocks she had already set out before her ! That evening , when she had served dinner and tea , The went quietly back to her work in the garden . A few minutes later , Father saw her . He stood stockstill , then slowly approached the growing wall . He touched it with his foot . " What 's this ? " he asked . " What do you think you 're doing ? " " I 'm building Christy 's house , " Mother said , setting in another block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He just watched . Then he looked a bit closer . Then his hand went out ; he pulled it back . He walked to the other end of the line of blocks . His upper lip twitched a bit ; he paused . . . . At last he said , " Look-it ! You 're doing it all wrong , woman . Where 's your foundation ? " " I knew I was forgetting something , " Mother answered crossly . By this time the other four bricklayers had come out and gathered round . " Look-it , boys , " said Father , turning to them . " Your mother 's trying to do our work ! " " Terrible , " said Paddy , examining critically the row of cement blocks and shaking his head disapprovingly . " You have n't even got them level , Mother ! " " That 's women for you , " said Peter . " Always trying to be like men . Go back to your dishes , Ma . " " Well , if it 's a man 's job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood up , and as she passed me , she smiled . The five bricklayers looked at each other . " C'm on , " said Father , " let 's start . " So they built my little house in the back garden . 0RIGINALLY it was intended only to make a sort of exercise room of it , a sort of gymnasium , where Dr. Warnants might treat me undisturbed . As time went on , however , I converted it into both a living room and a study , where I read , wrote , and slept . I got them to put up bookshelves for me . Thus at last I had broken away from the family , from the noise and bustle of the house . Now at last I could live in comfortable solitude and paint and write as much as I liked , in freedom . In summer I could sit by the open window and read , the only sound being the happy chorus of the birds in the trees outside , and when the winter came it was even more pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark and watch the red glow dance on the walls and fall on the backs of books on the shelves , making their gilt lettering stand out in the gloom . It was great fun , going off on travels of imagination through the pages of books . My reading , small and narrow though it was as yet , helped me to know something of a world beyond the four walls of my study . One day Dr. Collis told me he had decided to send me over to London to see his sister-in-law , Mrs. Eirene Collis , who was a well-known specialist in cerebral palsy . Now that I had taken the preliminary exercises , he wanted her opinion on how I was likely to respond to a full-scale rehabilitation program . He would ask her to examine me herself in Middlesex Hospital and give him he . ' opinion on my chances of leading a fairly normal life . I would travel to London by air in a few days ' time , and Dr. Warnants. who had gone ahead of me , would meet me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Mrs. Collis . Mother was to travel with me . I realized then that everything depended on Mrs. Collis ' verdict , that my future actually lay in her hands . If she decided I was too far advanced a case to benefit from treatment , then I would be back to where I was before Dr. Collis found me . If , on the other hand , she should conclude that I would respond favorably to treatment , then my life would have some meaning , some ultimate worth and value . Then surely I could begin to break down some of the walls that stood between me and an ordinary existence . I was at the crossroads . IT WAS January , 1949 , the start of the new year , when I made the flight to London with Mother . We stayed one day . That was all . Yet in the space of a few hours my entire life was changed . At the Middlesex Hospital in London we were taken up in a lift to a small consulting room to await the arrival of Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair . " Scared ? " he asked me . I shook my head just to give myself courage . " You are , you know , " he continued . " You 're scared stiff , but you 're too stubborn to admit it even to yourself . That 's good . " Suddenly the door behind me opened . A man and a woman came into the room . My eyes were drawn toward the small , thin woman with the graying hair , handsome face , and light , springy step . I felt sure that this was Mrs. Collis , and in her presence my doubts and apprehensions vanished , because her slow smile . her complete naturalness and casual manner made me feel secure and selfpossessed , no matter what her verdict might turn out to be . " Sorry I 'm late , " she said to us , sitting on the edge of the desk and lighting a cigarette . For a few moments she took no notice of me , sat chatting with Mother about the flight , the weather , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cigarette , slid off the desk , and strolled over to me . " I was just letting some of your tension escape , Christy , " she said smiling . " How old are you now ? " she asked me , and when Mother attempted to tell her my age she held up her hand and said politely , " Let Christy tell me himself ? just for fun . " I managed to grunt that I was eighteen . " Eighteen ? " said Mrs. Collis . " Eighteen years in trouble is quite enough for anyone . Do n't you think it 's time you did something about it ? " I nodded my head in agreement . " Yes , so do I , " she said .  | When the examination was over , they all withdrew to the further corner of the room to speak among themselves for a while . I sat alone on the couch , my heart beating quickly , waiting desperately for the verdict . I sweated all over . It was as if I were on trial for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . At last Mrs. Collis came across the room slowly and sat on the couch beside me . " Well , Christy , " she said . " I think we can help you . I think you might even be helped immensely in the end . " My heart gave a leap of pure joy . Helped immensely ! What else mattered now ? All the old bitterness and heartache was changed now into an all-pervading happiness that lit up my face and made my heart dance wildly . It might be the summit after all ! " Yes , " continued Mrs. Collis . " It 's possible , if you are prepared to do lots of really hard work over the next few years . But ? " Here she paused , looked steadily at me , and went on . " You must first make a big sacrifice . Nothing good is ever obtained without one , and yours is ? you must resolve never to use your left foot again . " My left foot ! But that meant everything to me ? I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was my only means of communication with the outside world , my only way of reaching the minds of other people and making myself articulate and intelligible . The rest of me was useless , worthless , and that one limb , my left foot , was the only workable thing in my whole body . Without it I would be lost , silent , powerless . " Yes , I know it 's tough , " she said , interpreting my thoughts . " It 's a tremendous sacrifice . But it 's the only way out ? there are no short cuts . If you continue to use your left foot , you 'll never talk , walk , or use your hands , and without being able to do these things you can not lead a reasonably normal life in any sort of society . So it all simmers down to this : Will you promise never to use your left foot again ? " I understood the wisdom of what she had said . There were indeed to be no half measures . It was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to win it I must put everything I had into it ? I must pay a great price , perhaps a cruel price , to win a greater gain . It would be frightful , but it might bring victory in the end . " I will , " I said to Mrs. Collis ? and it was probably the clearest word I had ever uttered . AT THE clinic I embarked on the long program of arduous exercises and other therapy that have been so helpful in the subsequent years , but something besides my nerves and muscles underwent change there too . I saw the most intense kind of suffering in others , most of them small children . It was an instruction , an education in human suffering , a new , frightening experience for one who until lately had seldom seen life beyond the walls of his own home . True , I hated my own affliction , I despised it . I was tormented , revolted at the very thought that I had been made different from other people . Yet I was soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I regarded in my worst moment as a curse from God , that was to bring a strange beauty into my life .  | I had been attending the clinic for about a year when it happened . I was outdoors , enjoying the warm April sunlight , hearing the branches of the trees rustle in the light , fresh wind . Gradually I heard a noise coming from the further end of the gravel path ? the sound of light footsteps . I caught sight of something red moving through the trees at the top of the path . Then the figure of a girl rounded the little bend and came in view . As she came forward , I saw she was a little above average height , brown-haired and green-eyed . Her features were clearcut , finely chiseled . There was a fresh bloom on her cheeks that spring morning , and serenity in her eyes . I was quite helpless to look away . I remember telling myself quite distinctly as she advanced , " This is the most beautiful girl I 've ever seen ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment and then approached the chair firmly . " Is Mr. Gallagher about , please ? " she asked , smiling . I was absolutely tongue-tied . It was n't only because of my usual speech difficulty . In the end I spluttered out that Mr. Gallagher would be back soon and she smiled again and went by me into the empty clinic . Slowly , bit by bit as the days went on , I got to know little things about her ; she now worked at the clinic ; she was a university graduate ? that frightened me a little at first ; she came from Galway ; and , lastly , her name was Sheila . ONE morning , later , I was feeling despondent , my thoughts lost in a surge of pessimism . I felt myself slipping back into the old mood of depression , which now and then came sweeping back upon me . Then a voice said to me suddenly , " Cheer up , Christy ! " I jerked around and found Sheila smiling at me encouragingly from the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we began to know each other quite well . I began to go through the exercises with greater zest . One day , greatly daring , I brought her a short story that I had begun to write before my visit to the Middlesex Hospital in London . She took it home with her , read it , and returned it to me with a note containing her views on my future prospects as a " scribe . " Of course I lost no time in replying to her note , and so we began corresponding with each other . I must confess that to this limited extent I began to use my left foot again . Where Sheila was concerned , I felt I had to break down this greatest barrier that stood between me and other people ? the great speech barrier . What I could n't say with my lips I 'd say through my pen . The walls were indeed still high around me , but I was scaling them one by one . Scaling them , yes , breaking loose from them , yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " freedom , " of " emancipation " and " release " from physical affliction . But I found it was n't simply a question of overcoming , or at least fighting against my own handicap like a brave little hero and having them clap me on the back and tell me I " would get there soon . " If by " there " they meant physical independence at last , that was all right , but if they also meant by it complete independence , complete freedom from all mental and emotional conflict , then they were wrong . Then all those fine-sounding phrases like " freedom " and " liberation " were hollow . For I was now finding out for myself that the pain and bitterness I had felt in the past during my " captivity , " while I was still behind my prison bars , were as nothing compared with what I now felt at the very time when I was struggling out of my chains , when my old hopelessness had been replaced by a fairly reasonable chance of recovery . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the name " awakening " and " enlightenment . " In time , indeed , and with the help of the clinic , I might so overcome myself that I would be enabled to lead a normal life , or at least a more ordinary , more independent one . But I knew deep inside me that there would always be something missing ? something that would never make the picture complete or let the pieces of the jigsaw fall finally into one perfect whole . There would always be a part of it missing . My affliction was not , after all , incurable . But something else was ? my lack of really normal human expression and relationship . No matter how well I might conquer my handicap , I would never be a normal individual leading a normal life . The old difference would always remain . I wanted so desperately to love and be loved , but It was a bitter realization , but a true one , a necessary one . What good would it do me if I were to shut my eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was tempted to do that many times , but I was only putting off the final ordeal a little longer ; it had to come sometime . It came ; it made me sad , bitter for a time , but in the end it also made me stronger within myself . If I could never really be like other people , then at least I would be like myself and make the best of it . So it was that ultimately Sheila was the best friend that I could possibly have found . She was like a mirror in which I could see myself at last without disguise . She was the first milestone in my adult life , and through her I learned to travel the rest of the road without falling into any of the pitfalls along the way . We wrote a lot to each other , mine dreamy , fanciful letters , hers full of wisdom : " In one of your letters you say how some people think you a hero , and that you do n't feel very heroic . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion of you : The good God gave you an excellent brain and an artistic streak . He also gave you a physical handicap . With the foregoing mental equipment , your present struggle against your athetosis is inevitable . . Remember your mother too , without whose good sense you might easily have turned into a most objectionable young man always talking of what might have been ' .... I have a little brown box at home in my study , closely guarded , inside which lie every one of the letters I received from Sheila , all bound together with a piece of sentimental blue ribbon . Thirtytwo in all . I counted them the other day . MY EXPERIENCES at the clinic and the effects it had upon me made my mind full of ideas . I wanted to say some-  | thing , not merely to my family , not merely to my friends , but rather to everyone , to the world as a whole . There was something in me , some inner urge to speak , and I wanted to get it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them understand it . But ? how could I express what I wanted to say , what I wanted everyone to know ? My hands were still of no use to me at all ; they were still twisted and unruly , still powerless to grasp or hold anything . I still was n't able to speak any sort of intelligible language outside the family circle . What about my faithful old friend , my left foot ? The foot that had served me so well and which had been my only weapon against despair and defeat through all those years ? No ! Short notes to Sheila were one thing . A full-length expression of my thoughts and feelings would be quite another . I could n't go back on my promise to Mrs. Collis . I 'd think myself a traitor if I did . So it seemed I had reached a dead end ; everywhere I turned the way was blocked . I felt the same way anyone else would feel with his hands and feet tied and a gag in his mouth . Then suddenly I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve years of age at the time , doing his homework ? an English composition , which I could see by the scowl on his face he was n't enjoying very much . The idea of him sitting there writing and yet not knowing what to write about , and me sitting there by the window , my brain teeming with ideas and yet not able to hold a pen in my hand , almost made me want to run amok ! Instead I leaned forward and asked him what he was doing . " Trying to write a composition for school , " answered Eamon with a sigh . " I 'll get biffed if I do n't do it right . " I saw my chance . I told him I 'd help him ? on condition that he 'd do something for me in return . Later we went out to my study , got a nine-penny jotter out of the drawer , sat down at the table , and looked at each other . " What d'ye want me to write down for you ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My life story , " I told him . Poor Eamon let his pen clatter down on the table . " Your ? what ? " he asked . I told him again , and this time he was quite silent . In the end I got him to agree to write for me for " an indefinite period . " We started that very afternoon , without any sort of preparation whatever . THAT first attempt to write my autobiography was a ponderous piece of work , a veritable forest of four- and fivesyllable words . My only reading up to this time had been Dickens , and in my inexperience I imagined it my duty to try and imitate his style of writing ? with the result that the English I used was fifty years out of date ! So long were the words that I had to spell them letter by letter before my brother could write them down on the page . That tremendous first attempt amounted to thousands of words . Its title typified the whole . I called it " The Reminiscences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice piece of irony , a sort of punch on the nose for the doctors who had doubted my sanity  | when I was five . In desperation I got off a card to Dr. Collis . I thought of him because he had been my physician and friend . It was only later that I found out that he was not just Dr. Collis but Robert Collis the author too , the man who had written the play Marrowbone Lane ; The Silver Fleece , his own autobiography ; along with other plays and books . It was my good fortune that he was qualified as a teacher as well as a physician . He arrived the next day . As he read the first page of my manuscript , he raised his eyebrows . After a bit he threw down the copy on the table and studied me . " What on earth ! " he said . " The language you use may have been popular in the reign of Queen Victoria , but ? " My heart sank within me as I heard this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and reads well . It shows me that you could write if you had some reasonable guidance . " Then he got up and inspected the books I had on the shelves . He shook his head . " To write good modern English , one has to read modern English , Christy . Dickens is all very well , but literary taste , like all other tastes , changes . " Then he showed me the books he had brought me . There was a book of L.A.G . Strong 's short stories , two books by Sean O'Faolain , some books of his literary brothers John Stewart Collis and Maurice Collis , and six volumes of a collection of famous literature . " Christy , " he said , " if all this has done nothing else , it has given you lots of practice at thinking out ideas . If you still want to write your story I nodded my head vigorously ; I wanted to write that story above everything else . " Okay , then , " he went on . " You must begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to teach me . " Let me give you some concrete points : Whenever you can , use a short word rather than a long one . You have painted pictures with a brush ; try and do the same thing with a pen . Practice it . Just describe the room here ? your old chair , the picture on the smudged wall there , the broken mirror , the books , that colored photograph ? " At last he came over to me and shook hands . I knew then that I was about to start on the toughest job I had ever taken on . DR . COLLIS arranged for a tutor to give me some of the formal education I could not go to school to take . For the first month or so I felt very backward and ill at ease in the teacher 's presence , and I was painfully conscious of the defect in my speech when answering his questions . But the first bit of awkwardness wore off , and so settled did I become that I began speaking quite as freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , had left the clinic to be married . When the official " programme " was over for the night , the tutor would stay on for a while and we 'd discuss many things , like the philosophy of Bertrand Russell , the poetry of Thompson and Yeats , or what psychoanalysis is , so that , apart from the ordinary lessons , I learned a great deal . And , of course , those talks greatly helped me to speak more clearly and confidently . But sometimes , on nights when I was supposedly reading Caesar or studying a Shaw play or doing problems in geometry or arithmetic , I 'd stop suddenly and  | start thinking of all the girls I could have met , all the girls I could have danced with and perhaps made love to , like Peter and Paddy , my brothers . One evening when I felt particularly isolated and jealous of them , I sat morosely doing nothing . Then I flung myself on to my bed , tore off my left shoe , seized a pencil between my first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without pause , without consciousness of my surroundings . I felt a different person . I was free , I could think , I could live , I could create ? Suddenly the door opened and the doctor came in . I stopped , tucked my left foot under me and tried to grin at him and said something about a " cold evening , " " So you had to call out the old left foot again , " he said . I pulled it from under me rather sheepishly . " I wondered , " he said , " how long you could stick it . Dictation is not quite enough , is it ? Well , I understand . We wo n't tell Eirene Collis . But do n't use it except when you must . " I felt relaxed . I could be myself sometimes anyway . And if I could n't know the joy of dancing , I could know the ecstasy of creating . THE Burl Ives Concert in Dublin will always remain one of the most exciting events of my life . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that Burl Ives will sing and I shall make an appeal for cerebral palsy . But I think it would be much more to the point if you did . " " Me ? " I said . " How ? " He grinned . " You 've finished your first chapter , about the letter A and your mother , " he said . " If I were to read them that , they 'd know much more about cerebral palsy from the inside than if I were to talk to them for an hour . But you must come along with me and sit beside me so that they 'll know it 's your work , not mine . " It seemed as though all of Dublin turned out for the concert . I found myself sitting in a chair beside Mother , Father , Peggy , Tony and his wife . From the other side of the curtain I could hear people talking and shuffling as they settled into their seats . I knew there was a huge crowd in the hall and that the curtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on , I gripped the sides of the chair and tried to hold myself rigid . All I could see was a huge white blur of faces staring up at me . I felt myself go hot and cold in turn . Then Burl Ives began to sing . He had a wonderful , soft , mellow voice with a humorous twist in it . I just shut my eyes and listened to his singing and half forgot my stage fright . Soon I was laughing like everyone else as he sang " The Blue Tail Fly , " " Mr. Froggie Went A-Courtin ' , " " The House Where Grandmother Dwells . " Finally he had everyone singing with him , including me . I 'd quite forgotten everything else . Then the doctor got up and went to the microphone . The crowd before him was still in a jovial mood , laughing and talking . It was n't going to be easy to interest them . He took my manuscript from his pocket and began to read . For the first few minutes there was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffling their feet and coughing . I saw one man reading a morning paper . Obviously he had come to enjoy a concert , not to be made to listen to a lecture on cripples . Gradually , however , movement and noise ceased . I looked down at the faces before me , but now they were no longer just questioning faces with peering eyes but intent , friendly faces full of interest . They were listening ! I was still tense , still taut as a telegraph wire , sitting on the stage in full view . But after a while my tension left me . I forgot my unusual appearance . I listened . Was this true , me sitting on a stage with Mother and Father before a huge audience , listening to a description of my own childhood ? Had I really written all that stuff ? Did all that really come out of my mind ? It seemed as if I was dreaming . I listened . I remembered the day , that December day , when I had first drawn the letter A with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remembered my brothers , the day Tony swung me into the canal , while poor Jim stood by and cried " He 'll drown ! " I remembered the awful day when I found out about myself , and the painting days , and the lonely nights in bed , Peter snoring in the dark . I remembered Shiela coming into the clinic on December mornings , her hair scattered by the wind and the rain on her face . . . . Then I became aware that the doctor had stopped speaking . There was now complete silence in the big hall . I saw somebody in the front row crying . I looked at Mother , sitting upright , her eyes glistening . I regarded Father , twisting his hat in his hands . He looked at me in a new way . Now Dr. Collis walked across the stage , laid his hand on my shoulder , and helped me to my feet . Then the cheering broke out . Somebody from the audience brought forward a huge bouquet of roses . The doctor stopped and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He held up his hand . " I think you will agree , " he said to the audience , " that there is only one thing to be done ? red roses for Mrs. Brown ! For you , ma'am ! " he said , handing the bouquet to mother with a bow . The cheering started again . I could see my brothers at the back of the hall yelling like mad . Mother took the bouquet looking like a Queen Mother , as if she had been quite used to roses every day of her life . I thought her face was rather red . Standing beside her was Father , his shoulders drooping and his bald head bent forward . As Mother laid the flowers across her arm , I heard her say in a loud whisper , " Straighten up , Paddy , ca n't yer ! " Father stiffened but dropped his hat . Peggy picked it up . Then Burl Ives came on again . He began to sing our own Irish folk songs : " She Moved Through the Fair , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now I could enjoy it completely . I was at peace . I lay back in my chair while my old left foot beat time to the rhythm of the tune . Epilogue Cerebral palsy is a medical term that covers a number of conditions frequently due to brain injury during birth . The symptoms depend upon the part of the brain injured . If the higher part of the brain is affected the child will be taut , or what is called spastic . If the middle level is damaged , the condition is termed athetosis , and the child will show all sorts of abnormal writhing movements , particularly when he tries to carry out  | any co-ordinated effort . If the back part of the brain is affected , the result will be loss of balance , known as ataxia . There are other conditions , but these are the main ones conveyed by the general term cerebral palsy . As children learn not only through the senses of sight and sound but also through touch and movement , all cases of cerebral palsy , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is extremely hard sometimes to ascertain whether they are in fact primarily mentally defective or mentally normal but retarded due to failure of normal movement . In the last ten years a new approach , developed chiefly in America , has benefited some of these cases . Instead of cutting taut muscles and using splints , doctors teach the children by exercise to use the nerves that still exist undamaged . It was found that in many cases the children could be substantially rehabilitated , could in fact be taught to walk and to speak understandably ; and many , the majority , if treated early enough , could be vastly improved . The work of rehabilitation and re-education is , however , extremely slow and arduous , requiring much patience of patient and teacher alike . Christy Brown represents a particularly severe case of athetosis . He was so " paralyzed " that if it had not been for the tremendous persistence of his extraordinary mother he would probably have been shut away and utterly imprisoned in a home for mentally defective children and might never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts and his acceptance as an ordinary member of the family by his father and all his many brothers and sisters , he was able to remain at home and to learn to read , and to write with his left foot . At seventeen it is very late to start the treatment of athetosis , but Christy Brown has come on greatly during the last few years . He has learned to sit straight , to stand , to walk across the room ( though with great difficulty ) , and to speak so that an ordinary person can understand him , though he still must struggle to form many difficult words . He is still heavily handicapped , as his hands are almost useless , so that he can not feed himself or dress himself without help . Indeed , I am somewhat concerned as to how he is to continue " to write " because the supply of young bricklayer 's apprentices who act as his secretaries can not last much longer . He is improving all the time , however , and I have hopes that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his hands. ? R.C. Take the Fa ( Continued from top of the trellis were completely covered Or with grapevines .

Then the day came when the togetherness began to stretch thin . Elaine met Gino Santelli . We were no longer feminine musketeers . She pulled 1 away from us almost at once . She started to become Elaine , the lily maid of Astolat , motivated only by her great love for Lancelot . Or Juliet , whose life was nothing without young Romeo . I did n't like it a bit . Dorrie thought it was romantic , and mooned over them and helped where she could . But I wanted life to stay the way it was . For a while I almost hated Elaine .
