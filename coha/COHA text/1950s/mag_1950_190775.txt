Without exception , Communist countries uphold the principle laid down by Satirist George Orwell in the Animal Farm : all are created equal , but some are more equal than others . This means in practice that Communist Party members get more and better food , housing , clothing and recreation than the mass of the people , who live in darkness because they know not Marx . Anyone who suggests that Communists live like ordinary people is guilty of a heresy called egalitarianism , upon which the great Lenin himself pronounced anathema . <P> Last week Tito 's Yugoslavia went egalitarian . A government decree , effective Nov. 1 , closes all special food stores that serve party members and officials . Urban Yugoslav Communists will have to carry ration cards like other city dwellers . Special rest homes and resorts for the elect will be closed . Government agencies are forbidden to buy carpets , curtains , pictures and other items of interior decoration . After Nov. 1 , nobody will be able to get free gasoline . <P> Reason for the Spartan decree is Yugoslavia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by a severe summer drought . Housewives standing in long lines for meager bread rations grumbled when they saw the colonels ' and the commissars ' ladies breezing into well-stocked special food stores . Tito could have applied the new equality only to food , but he apparently considered it politically expedient to extend the measure over the whole field of amenities available to Communist party members . It all went to show how rapidly a vice such as egalitarianism could eat into an otherwise uncorrupted Communist society once it got a foothold.
