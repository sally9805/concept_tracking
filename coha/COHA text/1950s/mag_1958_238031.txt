ORPHEUS AT EIGHTY ( 372 pp. ) - Vincent Sheean-Random House ( $5 ) . <P> <P> To the Austrians who ruled northern Italy in the mid-19th century , the word Verdi was a nightmare . It haunted them from the very walls in huge letters , like the V sign of World War II . The great risorgimento that threw out the alien rulers and made the Italians a nation used Verdi as its symbolic pun-a tribute to Italy 's greatest composer and a proud abbreviation for the name and title of its King , " Vittorio Emanuele , Re d'Italia . " <P> Nobody can explain just how the operas of Giuseppe Verdi became an " electrical communication with the spirit of the time . " The idea " just grew " - to the point where Italian patriots detected in the most innocent little note or inflection of a Verdi aria a cry for liberty and revolt . When Cavour received one night the telegram that began Italy 's second War of Independence , he said not a word to his aides . He merely flung the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trovatore to his sleeping countrymen . <P> Wounds &; Distress . Vincent Sheean calls his book Orpheus at Eighty because it recounts Verdi 's long life in a series of flashbacks showing the old composer looking back on the struggles and triumphs of his stupendous career . It is Sheean 's best book since Personal History ( 1935 ) , and if its prose could be rid of repetitions and the parentheses that break out half a dozen to the page , it would be the best introduction to Verdi and his music in the English language . Clearly a labor of love , it is at once a fine tribute and a history of bitter wounds and infinite distress . <P> Verdi was born of peasant stock near the town of Busseto in the Po Valley in 1813 . When he was 18 , the townsfolk sent him to Milan Conservatory , hoping that he could be trained to become Bus-seto 's organist and orchestra director . But the conservatory examiners flunked Verdi ; his talent for composition , they said , was " passable , " but his pianoforte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and wrists . " This " blow to all his pride and hope was so terrible " that Verdi never forgot , never forgave it . Helped by a friendly patron , he buckled down to a period of remorseless study and composition . By 22 he had won his post as Busseto organist over violent opposition and married his childhood sweetheart , daughter of his patron . Their two children died in infancy , and wife Margherita followed them to the grave after only four years of marriage and just before her husband 's first big success , the opera Nabucco . <P> Calling the Tune .. Author Sheean is fascinated by Verdi 's " peasant " response both to the grim tragedies of his youth and the fame of his later years . The words that appear in Verdi 's last and perhaps greatest work , Falstaff- " Cammina ! Cammina ! " ( keep going , keep going ) - were already his maxim in his null and he kept going at the rate of more than an opera a year . Verdi hated Milan , hated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of the foreigner and the secret police . " But to " keep going . " he pruned , cut and distorted " his rugged talent to suit the conditions of the time . " With peasant toughness . Verdi awaited the day when he would call the tune as well as write it .
