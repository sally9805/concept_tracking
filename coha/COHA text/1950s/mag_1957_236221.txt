The Bachelor Party ( Hecht-Hill-Lancaster ; United Artists ) . Paddy Chayefsky is the Proust of The Bronx . He remembers everything-even sometimes how things really are in working-class life in the big city . He remembers concretely , with photographic eye and phonographic ear . Yet his memories seem to move him - and his audiences-in inverse proportion to their importance . He is a minusculist , with a passion for the little ideas and the Little People-apparently not so much because they are people as because they are little . But for all that , Author Chayefsky has a metropolitan instinct as keen as a pigeon 's , and an old cab driver 's mystical sense of the city 's meaning . <P> All the things that Paddy is are hard at work in this film , but often they are working at cross-purposes with something he is not but would apparently like to be : the father of his country . In other plays he has sometimes shown a tiresome tendency to prate , but in this one he spends rather more than an hour in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last he thunders forth his text , the congregation is ready to hear the wisdom of the ages .

And if you do n't finish night school , brother , you 'll spend the rest of your life as a crumby little bookkeeper at 72 per . " <P> The bookkeeper ( Don Murray ) is the protagonist in this Philistine 's Progress . He lives with his pretty little working wife ( Patricia Smith ) in a small flat in a big Manhattan housing development . As the picture begins , the wife has just told him that she is going to have a baby . He is stunned . How will he ever be able to finish night school ? And if he does n't finish night school ...

" <P> Charlie wants to go , but he 's afraid to - afraid he 'll take one too many and do something he 'll be sorry for next day . So of course he goes . He goes to the dinner at the big second-rate steak house , where everybody gets a snootful and tells dirty stories . And from there to a night on the town .
