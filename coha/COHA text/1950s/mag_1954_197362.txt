Last week was a week of scientific conventions . In half a dozen cities around the globe , scientists milled in their large , confused gatherings , swapped ideas , canvassed covertly for better jobs and passed along the gossip of their professional circles . When not so engaged , they listened to some of the news of their trade . Items : <P> Advice to Psychologists . At a Manhattan meeting of the American Psychological Association , Dr. Fred E. Fiedler of the University of Illinois cast doubt on the existence of " natural leaders . " Financed by the Office of Naval Research , Psychologist Fiedler spent three years trying to find out what makes certain groups so much more effective than others . He came to the conclusion that the most important factor is not so much the ability of the leader or of the subordinates . It is the " matching " of the leader to the men under him . <P> In groups as diverse as college basketball teams , student civil-engineering crews and Air Force bomber crews , Fiedler found that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his subordinates may find himself no longer able to make clear-cut decisions . But an aloof leader may isolate himself too much from his key man ( e.g. , foreman , or top sergeant ) and thus lose touch with his group . When this happens , the rank and file are apt to turn to someone else as an informal leader . Therefore , the most effective leaders according to Fiedler , are men who are properly matched to their subordinates . When possible , an overly friendly commander should be assigned to a taut unit with rigid barriers between lesser ranks . Overly aloof leaders should command units where barriers of rank are more relaxed . <P> Worries for Sociologists . The World Congress on Population , meeting at Rome under the auspices of theU.N. , was greeted by a blast from the Vatican newspaper , L'Osservatore Romano , denouncing birth control and other curbs on population . The Congress , nevertheless , discussed not only the increase of man 's numbers , but also what might be done about it . <P> According to the Congress ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has risen in the last five years from 25 million a year to more than 36 million . <P> But there are signs , reported the delegates , that this situation may not continue indefinitely . In many parts of the world , the increase of population is leveling off . This is true even in Italy , famous for its fertility and its official opposition to population limitation . In Japan , where the government is strongly promoting birth control , one third of the people use some form of contraception . The Welfare Ministry 's chief worry , according to Japanese experts , is that too many Japanese women are resorting to abortion . In the last six months , they estimated , there were half a million legal abortions in Japan . <P> Consolation for Physicists . At the Oxford meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science , Nobel Prizewinner Sir John Cockcroft announced a bit of long-range good news . He was sure , said Sir John , that long before the world exhausts its supply of uranium fuel , the energy of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb ) can be turned from destructive to peaceful uses . If this is true , the human ' race need not worry about its energy supply for a very long time. *
