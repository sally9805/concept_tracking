The National Assembly of Free China is a sort of political stockholders ' meeting . Comprised of delegates elected generally not from politics but from universities , business and the professions , it meets every six years to review the government 's operations , make suggestions , and elect a president and vice president . Last week , meeting for the first time since they met on the mainland in 1948 , 1,526 delegates gathered in Taipeh . <P> They found the management worried and discouraged . The West had called their enemy , Communist China , to a meeting in Geneva . Who knew what kind of deal the West might make behind their backs ? At home , the management was frustrated by a lack of demand for their services , and fearful of their aging equipment and personnel . Time was running out , warned Premier Chen Cheng , newly designated nominee for vice president , and heir-designate to President Chiang Kaishek : " If we wait another three to five years to counterattack the mainland , our chances of success will diminish to almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged to attack us . " <P> Both encouragement and warning came from an invited guest . Dr. Hu Shih , 62-year-old ex-diplomat and philosopher , is China 's most honored scholar in a civilization which accords scholars a respect akin to reverence . Hu Shih has always refused to join the Kuomintang , has often been regarded as a possible rallying point by intellectuals among the 13 million overseas Chinese who were both anti-Communist and anti-Kuomintang . Hu Shih disowned such disciples . He had come all the way from New York ( where he has lived since 1949 ) , he said , because " I feel it a moral obligation to be here . There are only two main political forces in the world today-Communist and antiCommunist . Only very foolish people like Nehru think there is a third force . In spite of its shortcomings , this government is the Chinese center of the anti-Communist force . " <P> But Hu Shih had lingering misgivings . He deplored the Kuomintang 's insistence on one party , its rigid repression of criticism ( " On the whole there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I would like to see still more freedom of the press and person in Taiwan " ) , on its authoritarian " obey the leader " doctrine . That Hu Shih could say these things when and where he did was some testimonial to Formosa 's freedom , and one reason he had made his choice . The problem was to extend that freedom to less distinguished critics . <P> ? ? ?
