Of all the stately homes of England , perhaps the stateliest is Chatsworth , a vast Palladian palace set on 50,000 acres of park and woodland , which for generations has been the family seat of the Dukes of Devonshire , whose family name is Cavendish . The first earl , who was one of Henry VIII 's bullyboys , began amassing the huge family fortune by taking over some of the prize abbey lands confiscated during Henry 's fight with Rome . The Devonshires came to epitomize the British landed aristocracy , and became famous for their arrogant eccentricities . <P> The present Chatsworth , their ducal seat , was completed in 1706 . Besides such wonders as a copper beech tree fashioned of real copper and a conservatory large enough to drive through in a coach-and-four ( so that visitors would not have to step down from their carriage to see the blossoms ) , Chatsworth boasts one of the world 's greatest private art collections . Its graceful galleries are hung with Michelangelos , Raphaels , Titians , Velasquezes and Rembrandts . Its bookcases are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studded with classic sculpture . <P> In recent years the Dukes of Devonshire have been fighting a rearguard action against the welfare state . High death duties were making it difficult for them to bequeath their treasures intact to posterity . In 1926 the ninth Duke of Devonshire did what he could to preserve Chatsworth by turning the whole estate into a stock company and signing over most of its shares to his son . Twenty years later the son , by then tenth duke , a crusty veteran of Gallipoli and France , negotiated a contract by which his wife and the Duke of Buccleuch , as trustees , would take over 1,850,000 worth of the estate , thus exempting that much from death duties . However , the duke made the arrangement too late , and in 1950 he died before it could become legal . A chancery court ordered the heir to pay a full 80% of the 3,000,000 assessed value of Chatsworth and its art collection . To cover the cost of the levy , the art collection itself would have to be broken up and sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buxton Cavendish , the elegant young eleventh Duke of Devonshire , appealed the ruling . <P> Last week , without explanation , the duke dropped the case . Presumably the government has agreed to take over Chatsworth itself as a national museum in lieu of the death duties . " The dispersal of this collection , " the Daily Telegraph said approvingly , " would have been a tragic and irretrievable loss , for the greatest of its incomparable treasures had its value enhanced by the company it kept . " <P> The eleventh duke will probably continue to live , with his wife and two children , in the modest country home which used to belong to the steward of the estate .
