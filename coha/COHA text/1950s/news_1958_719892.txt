txt HOUSE UNIT FINDS NO ADAMS ' INTENT ' TO SWAY U.S. BOARD But Hebert Says There Was No Doubt White House Had Impact on Raylaine Case INFLUENCE ' NOT PROVEN ' Inquiry Scores Top Official for Refusing to Appear in Army Contract Study By ANTHONY LEWIS Special to The New York Timer . WASHINGTON , Aug. 10 ? A House Armed Services subcommittee reported today that it had seen " no evidence " of any " intent " by Sherman Adams to influence the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals in the case of Raylaine Worsteds , Inc . But the subcommittee chairman , Representative F. Edward Hebert , Democrat of Louisiana , said there was no doubt that White House communications had had an impact on the board , intended or not . He also was critical of the Assistant to the President for declining to testify . ' Scam Verdict ' " I 'd say it 's a Scotch verdict : not proven , " Mr. Hebert said . He said : " We could n't pass judgment on Mr. Adams ' intent because Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Raylaine , a defunct Manchester , N. H. , textile company , for refunds of penalties for the late delivery of wool cloth under a 1940 contract . Raylaine was penalized $47 , - 000 . In a series of administrative and court actions the company tried to get back $25,000 . Last year the Board of Contract Appeals , in its fifth decision on the case , gave Raylaine more than it had asked 540,282 . Letters to Adams The transcript of closed hearings by the House subcommittee showed that Raylaine officials wrote at least seven letters to Mr. Adams about the case between 1954 and this year . Five of the letters were addressed " Dear Sherm , " although the writer of several testified that he was no friend of Mr. Adams and had met him only casually . The letters asked variously for Mr. Adams ' " intercession , " " interest " and " weight " in the case . The Raylaine letters were sent through White House defense channels to the Board of Contract Appeals , which was asked to prepare draft replies.1 Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherm " letters , forwarded by the White House , troubled board members . believe I remember the general , shall I say , griping // among the board on the White House attempting to interfere with their reaching a fair decision in this case , " William M. Lyons , recorder of the board , , testified . " Because of these letters , these ' Dear Sherm ' letters being forwarded over to us by the White House , the board was a little unhappy  --  to paraphrase it , " the White House trying to interfere with their proper procedure . ' " Mr. Lyons , among others , made a point in his testimony of the fact that the Raylaine letters had been sent to the board instead of Mr. Adams ' simply asking the board for a report on the status of the case . " Where the constituent ran to the White House and the White House sent the constituent 's letter over to us , " Mr. Lyons said , " it is inferring that the White House would like to have favorable consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a former Governor of New Hampshire , began on April 5 , 1954 . At that time the Board of Contract Appeals was about to consider a Government motion to dismiss Raylaine 's appeal . This first letter was from George C. Lincoln , superintendent of the mill , and was addressed " Dear Sherman . " It said , " We would be deeply grateful " if Governor Adams would ask two members of the board to " consider carefully " Raylaine 's case and grant a hearing , as requested , " if they consider it in the interest of jus-I tice . " The letter ended with the , " hope that we may secure your intercession upon our behalf . " ' It was signed " George C. Lin- , coln . " The reply , drafted by the board 's recorder , Mr. Lyons , simply gave the status of the case . It was addressed " Dear George . " On Feb. 16 , 1955 , after the board had denied the Government 's motion to dismiss , Mr. Lincoln wrote to Mr. Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the merits . The letter was addressed " Dear Sherm " and signed " George . " The reply , again drafted by Mr. Lyons , was another routine report on the status of things . Mr. Lincoln wrote again on March 10 , 1955 , addressing " Dear Sherm . " He said that the Government was trying to stall , and " we earnestly request your intercession so that their dilatory tactics may no longer be effected in holding up our appeal . " On March 30 , 1956 , the board rejected Raylaine 's appeal on the merits . It held that a Controller General 's ruling against Raylaine in 1942 deprived the board of jurisdiction . Raylaine then filed a motion asking the board to reconsider . On July 19 , 1956 , Governor Adams was sent a letter by , Allen S. Grew , office manager I of Raylaine . Addressed " Dear Sherm " and signed " Allen , " it rgad in part : " We are anxiously awaiting a decision from the board and would greatly appreciate it if you could inquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your interest in our behalf will result in an early favorable decision . " P. S. Regards from your friends at Sweeney Post . " Not a Friend , He Says Mr. Grew testified that he was not a friend of Governor Adams , but they " probably had met . " Asked why he had used the Governor 's first name , he said : " New Hampshire , you know , is quite a small community . Everybody knows one another . I do n't think I ever heard Mr. Adams called anything but ' Sherm Adams . ' " Mr. Grew said Sweeney Post was an American Legion poet that Governor Adams might have visited . Under questioning by Mr. Hebert , he conceded that no one at the post had actually sent regards . " In reality , " Mr Hebert said , " the purpose of putting that in was to take it in the spirit of camaraderie ? That is right . ' Good old Sherm , the boys down here are talking about you all the time , and send their regards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wanted to make good old Sherm feel good , that the boys were still talking about him back home ? " " Probably , " Mr. Grew replied . On Aug. 9 , 1956 , the board refused to reconsider the case . But on March 12 , 1957 , the Controller General withdrew his 1942 decision against Raylaine , and Raylaine once more asked for reconsideration . Mr , Grew wrote Governor Adams on March 25 , 1957 , enclosing a copy of the Controller General 's new decision and asking Mr. Adams ' help in getting early action from the Board of Contract Appeals , On June 11 , 1957 , the board did agree to hear the appeal again . On Nov. 27 , 1957 , it finally decided in Raylaine 's favor . But there still was the problem of actually getting the money . Raylaine 's president , Leo Wolff of New York , then wrote Governor Adams . The letter , addressed " Dear Sir , " said that in the past Mr. Adams " had been kind enough to intercede for Raylaine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " if he would intercede again to assure prompt payment of the refund . On Jan. 6 , 1958 , Mr. Grew wrote " Dear Sherm " to the same effect , saying " again I 'm calling on you to use your good offices in expediting the Raylaine claim . ' Soon afterward the money was actually paid . Mr. Grew testified that he had actually stopped working for Raylaine in 1955 and had written the subsequent letters to Governor Adams at the request of the company 's lawyer . He was paid $500 out of the refund . The remainder was split 50-50 by the lawyer and the company 's creditors . Memoranda inside the board showed . some resentment of the various letters . One of April 2 , 1957 , by Roswell M. Austin , said : " Because of intervention of Mr. Adams from the White House , and some Congressman , I understand that sentiment is growing to grant another oral hearing . Though I deeply resent the intrusion , which I think is highly unethical , I am willing to ' go along ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all others who testified said the final decision for Raylaine was reached solely on the merits and was correct . Letters in behalf of Raylaine were also written by three Republican members of Congress ? Senators Irving M. Ives of New York and Styles Bridges of New , Hampshire and Representative , Chester Merrow of New Hampr shire . The subcommittee found I nothing amiss in their letters .
