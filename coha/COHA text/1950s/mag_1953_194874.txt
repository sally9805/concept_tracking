The sullen olive groves and dwarf wheat fields around San Severo , on the spur of the Italian boot , have long bred Communists . Working for as little as 64 a day on land they could never buy , the San Severini were eager listeners to Communist organizers , who promised " The land will be given to you when Palmiro Togliatti is Premier of Italy . " <P> Slow-moving and small-scale though it was , land reform last spring began to come from Premier Alcide de Gasperi 's Christian Democratic government in Rome , and to seep down to the cactus-studded plains of southeastern Italy . At first , only 27 peasants around San Severo received land-four hectares ( 9.9 acres ) each . But it set the peasants thinking . A Communist troubleshooter was rushed to San Severo to quiet the doubts . <P> " Comrades , for only 27 traitors you will not sell your souls to the Americans , " he said . This was hardly an answer to a rugged young peasant named Matteo Pistillo , nicknamed Spaccatutto ( worldbeater ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All right , " he cried , " but when will Palmiro become our Premier ? It may be true what the comrade said , but it is still truer that today I see the land reform . " Pistillo had heard of other defections from the Communist Party in southern Italy . By last month the reform had given farms to 146 families around San Severo . <P> Last week Matteo Pistillo the world-beater led 431 of his comrades into San Severo 's municipal theater , and there , before Christian Democratic Party workers who could not quite believe it , had them pile their Communist Party cards on the table and sign up as members of the Christian Democratic Party . " Friends , there are no more traitors here , " announced the worldbeater . " We free men are choosing the way of justice . " It was the biggest mass defection from Italy 's Communist Party ( the best-entrenched in Western Europe ) since the war . <P> Next morning the San Severini discovered that the town 's Communist headquarters had been shut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a message : " Closed for shame .
