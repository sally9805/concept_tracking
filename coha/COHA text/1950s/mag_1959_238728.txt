The northwest coast of Australia is one of the most desolate spots on earth . The nearest city of any size is Perth ( pop . 376,000 ) , some 1,450 miles to the south ; mosquitoes and crocodiles infest the mangrove swamps ; 12-ft. sharks cruise the lonely bays . In that unfriendly land , at remote Kuri Bay , a syndicate of Australians , Americans and Japanese called Pearls Proprietary Ltd. is turning out a product that has the world 's jewelers agog . The product : fabulous pearls as big across as a 25-cent piece , of gem quality so fine that a Manhattan jeweler recently sold a choker of Kuri Bay pearls for $100,000 . <P> Japan 's famed culture-pearl industry produces pearls of similar quality , but the oysters suited to Japan 's waters rarely develop a pearl bigger than two-fifths of an inch in diameter , and take between five and seven years in the process . By contrast , Australia 's giant " silver lips " oyster shells are as big as dinner plates , can produce pearls twice as big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality is so high that experts can not tell Kuri Bay 's from the best natural pearls without X ray . <P> <P> Buttons &; Pearls . Pearlers have long known about Australia 's big shells . Before World War II , Japanese divers worked the beds , and the export of pearl shells reached $1,000,000 annually . The war wrecked the industry . Though the Australian government tried promoting the shells , the diving is dangerous ( five divers were killed in one null bed alone last year ) , and cheap plastic buttons have all but ruined the market for those of expensive ( up to $2 for a set of six nickel-sized buttons ) mother-of-pearl . <P> The impetus for making the giant silver lips produce pearls instead of buttons came from the Australian government 's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization , which has the job of promoting new industries . Experiments produced only crude pearls , but showed promise . The man who turned the experiments into profits was Keith Bureau , an Australian businessman and partner in the big Melbourne importing firm of Brown &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a U.S. businessman , an Australian pearler , and asked Japanese Culture Pearl Expert Tokuichi Kuribayashi , president of Tokyo 's Nippo Pearl Co . Ltd. , to join them in growing pearls in the northwest . <P> <P> Pigtoes &; Secrets . With $500,000 capital , Pearls Proprietary Ltd. chose an isolated bay , named in honor of Pearler Kuribayashi , brought in an experienced team of 36 to start work . Into the big shells the pearlers inserted a special bead of shell cut from a big Mississippi River " pigtoe " mussel , then grafted in a piece of oyster flesh that was already exuding pearl-forming nacre . The first crop from the 100,000 oysters was harvested secretly in June 1958 , and the results were staggering . Though only 30% of the seeded oysters produced pearls , there were thousands of big , beautiful pearls ; the best was nine-tenths of an inch in diameter and turned out to be worth $4,900 ; eight others were appraised between $3,000 and $4,000 ; another 100 were worth better than $1,000 apiece . For their work and know-how , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the Australians and the American .
