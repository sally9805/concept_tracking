Two elegant portraitists , Reynolds and Gainsborough , ruled the calm and decorous art world of 18th Century London . But there was also an opposition , most notably represented by young , deeply religious William Blake with his alternately angelic and demonic visions . Others in the opposition ducked the angels ; they preferred the Pit . <P> In London 's Architectural Review , British Scholar Geoffrey Grigson sets out to make a case for three such painters , all born in 1741 : Henry Fuseli , John Henry Mortimer , and James Barry . " They share , " Grigson says , " in the sense of turmoil , of the black and red river , of the black and cavernous and jagged abyss . . . " In plainer language , all three painted more or less high-toned horror pictures . <P> Fuseli alternated pornographic drawings ( for private circulation among his friends ) with surrealistic nightmares of horses invading ladies ' bed-curtains and grim , grand-scale illustrations of Greek and Norse myths . To suggest the painter 's impact on his time , Grigson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lightning , his word is thunder , his jest death and his vengeance hell , " wrote one . " His neighborhood is unbearable . " The other , a fellow artist , called him " a monster in design ; his women are all strumpets , and his men all banditti , with the action of galvanized frogs but no man had the power like Fuseli of arousing the dormant spirit of youth . . . " <P> Mortimer had one quality Fuseli lacked : crass humor . Along with a doleful Caliban and a tumultuous Hercules Slaying the Hydra , he drew such fantasies as an orchestra of flatulent beasts , which must have seemed capricious and vulgar to all but his best friends . Yet , says Grigson , Fuseli and Mortimer " drank to different depths out of the same brew and looked together into the abyss . Mortimer like Fuseli wildly , demoniacally , lit up , the eyes , accentuated them in shade , filled them with the gleam of interior flame and power . " <P> Barry was the proudest and least able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he once wrote , " is its address to the mind . " Because he continually asserted his conviction that most other British painters were mindless , they expelled him from the Royal Academy . They also took great satisfaction in sneering at his half-mystical allegories and his absurd Death of General Wolfe ( in which all the figures were shown classically nude ) . <P> William Blake , 16 years the junior of Fuseli , Mortimer and Barry , drew , maintains Grigson , as badly as Barry-and " Little-Lambishly " besides . Blake once showed a drawing to Fuseli with the boast that the Virgin Mary herself had appeared to him and said it was very fine . Defiantly Blake added : " What can you say to that ? " " Say ? " exclaimed Fuseli . " Why , nothing-only that her ladyship has not immaculate taste . " <P> " Blake 's coat is too long , " Grigson concludes , " and he can spare an inch or two for his now destitute forerunners . " But Blake well deserves his long coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mortimer and Barry , he pictured the heights with as much vision as he did the abyss .
