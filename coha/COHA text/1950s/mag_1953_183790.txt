Both a halo and a forked tail go with the headline-catching role of chairman of the House Committee on Un-American Activities . Every chairman from Martin Dies on has been a white knight to part of the public , an inquisitorial fiend in the eyes of another part . By last week the new committee chairman , Illinois ' Harold Himmel Velde , had managed to dent his halo and seemed firmly hitched to his forked tail . Velde 's trouble : too much talk , too little caution , not enough political horse sense . <P> Last month he got into a wrangle with Agnes Meyer , wife of the board chairman of the Washington Post , over his committee 's investigation of Communists in education . Velde came off second best when he charged Mrs. Meyer with authoring a letter quoted in Pravda-only to discover later , on checking , that the letter had been written by a Mrs. Mayer of British Columbia ( TIME , March 2 ) . Then , one night last week , Velde took to the air with three Washington reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Midway in the program his foot slipped again : <P> Reporter Philip Potter of the Baltimore Evening Sun : " I 've noticed the last couple of weeks that churchmen seem to be increasingly critical of the congressional investigation in the education field . Some see it as a preliminary approach in the church field . Is there any likelihood of this ? " <P> Velde : I ca n't say at this time . . . I do think that this is very important to get across to the American people . The Soviet Union through the American Communist party is out to destroy all religious freedom in this country . I believe that our religious leaders should be made aware of that . . . <P> Potter : I notice that you do n't preclude getting into that field , then , at some future time . <P> Velde : Oh , no , it 's entirely possible . <P> Potter : Do you think that there is a field for investigation in that ? <P> Velde : Yes , I do , I definitely do think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would take , whether it would be into some of the organizations which are affiliated with the various churches throughout the country or whether it would be individuals . I rather presume it would be individuals . <P> The next morning 's papers headlined Velde 's promise of an investigation of churches . The reaction was as unfavorable as anybody ( except Velde ) would have expected . Velde protested that he had been " misinterpreted , " but even his fellow committee members were aghast at what he had actually said . The committee closed its doors and unanimously resolved that no new investigations would be announced or begun without approval of the full committee . Some Republicans in Congress were furious , and wanted to fire Velde from his chairmanship . Such talk ended abruptly when New York 's Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr . offered a formal resolution asking the House to censure Velde and kick him out of his job . Junior 's resolution ( which will doubtless die in the Rules Committee ) made Velde a party issue , and Republicans quickly closed ranks beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep Velde 's kind of bumbling Republican in the headlines .
