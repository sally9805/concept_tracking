txt Economic aid allocations of $600 , - 000,000 to Great Britain and $400 , - 000,000 to France under the new Mutual Security Program drew a verbal broadside from Senator Torn Connally , Democrat of Texas , to . day as the Senate Foreign Rela ? tions Committee began scrutinizing the $7,900,000,000 proposal . W. Averell Harriman , Director for Mutual Security , had told the committee that Britain and France would get most of the $1,800,000 , - 000 of " defense support " funds requested for Western Europe and intended to maintain economic and political stability and to increase defense production in recipient countries . " We ca n't go on forever appropriating large sums of money to the United Kingdom , France and other countries , and we 're under no obligation to do so , " shouted Mr. Connally , who is chairman of the committee . Recalling a recent grant of $300,000,000 in economic aid to Britain from transferable military aid funds , the Senator asserted : " The Prime Minister Winston Churchill , when he came over here , said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do , run after him . and hand . it to him ? " Grant Called ' Wise Decision ' Mr. Harriman , replied . that he considered the grant a " wise deci- .. sion . " He said that Russia was spending vast sums on military equipment for its satellites , then added : " We are facing a world-wide struggle , and it is very much in our interest to help our allies build up their military strength . " The total program requested by President Truman would provide $5,889,000,000 for weapons to be shipped to Western European countries , but Mr. Harriman argued in his opening testimony yesterday that this military aid would be of little use to them , if for lack of economic assistance , the recipients were unable to use them . Senator Connally told him today that Congress should not have authorized the transfer of up to 10 per cent of military aid funds for economic aid . Glaring over his glasses at Mr. Harriman , the Texan all but left his chair when the witness referred in passing to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Senator 's mouth popped open and cigar ashes spilled down his vest as he exclaimed : " You call $7,000,000,000 a small sum ? " Mr. Harriman said that he meant the amount was " relatively small in relation to the importance of building up the strength of our allies and the cost of any known alternative program . " Aside from bringing out the effect of election year uncertainties on the attitudes of Democratic leaders who must face the voters , the exchange suggested even rougher handling to come when the authorization measure reached the Senate floor . " Defense Support " Stressed Senator Connally appeared to be " loaded for bear " when he entered the big Senate Caucus Room to open the hearing . In his first question to Mr. Harriman , he wanted to know how much of the $7,900 , - 000,000 would go for " economic aid , " such as planes , tanks and guns . Administration witnesses have tried ' to get away from the " economic aid " term and coined " defense support " as a substitute . Mr. Harriman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $1,800,000,000 was for " defense support , " with all except $400,000,000 of this amount going to the original North Atlantic Treaty partners . The $400,000,000 was for Greece , Turkey , Yugoslavia and Austria , he added . More than $600,000,000 of nonmilitary aid funds would go for programs in other parts of the world , including $250,000,000 for the Far East ; about $222,000,000 for Point Four technical assistance in Asia and Africa , and about $141,000,000 for refugees in Israel and Arab states . Mr. Harriman started to explain how all defense support funds were part of the over-all defense effort and would help Western Europe fulfill rearmament commitments . li But Senator Connally broke in to ' , say that " no matter what you cal it , it 's still economic aid and alli Ithat business was supposed to end this year . " " Of course , it 's all of it for the ' defense effort according to your ) argument , " the Senator added . " In-1 stead of quitting it , we 've adopted this device for continuing the samel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a device , but a method of building up our military security . " Senator Connally appeared unconvinced . " Have Kremlin Off Balance " Senator Alexander Wiley , Republican of Wisconsin , told Mr. Harriman he considered it essential that Congress cut both domestic and foreign spending below the President 's budget . " If we let the American dollar go into another tailspin , then we 're lost , " Senator Wiley said . Without elaborating on this point , the Senator asked whether any previous appropriations for military aid remained unspent . Mr. Harriman said that some funds remained unexpended , but that all would be " obligated " by the end of the present fiscal year on June 30 . When Mr. Wiley asked the witness where he would cut the pending $84,000,000,000 Federal budget if he had the power , Mr. Harriman said that he would not reduce the estimates for mutual security or the domestic military establishment , but " I do n't know about the rest . " " We can stand this budget and if we continue to go forward vigorously we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think weh ave the Kremlin off balance and are on the way . " The committee put off until Monday its consideration of a. motion by Senator Brien , Democrat of Connecticut , that General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower be summoned from Europe to testify on the Administration 's authorization request . The motion is opposed by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr .. Republican of Massachusetts , who usually reflects the wishes of the General . To bring out arguments in favor of the program . Senator asked Mr. Harriman if there was a real threat to the security of the United States . " If so , " he added , " all this talk of balanced budgets and giving away money is beside the point . " " I do n't believe this country can survive if the sources of vital war materials are in the hands of unfriendly people who are determined to destroy us , " the witness replied . " We could not fight a war on the Fortress America theory . " he added . " We would find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to send missions to Moscow to ask for materials . " Would Bar World War III But if this country presses forward with its present policy through the Mutual Security Program , Mr. Harriman said , " we can prevent World War III . " During an exchange with Senator Theodore F. Green , Democrat of Rhode Island , Mr. Harriman conceded that workers in countries like France had not benefited by the Marshall Plan as much as had owners and managers . But he insisted the fault was not with the Marshall Plan , but with inequitH able taxation systems that de- ' pended for revenues on indirectl levies instead of income taxes . The result both in France and Italy , he added , was that the poorer working class paid morel than its share of taxes and received less than its share of the national income . Senator Green wanted to know What was being done to correct this situation under the Mutual Security Program so that communism would not profit from the workers ' discontent . Mr. Harriman said that all NATO member countries had agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution of the rearmament burden among all citizens . Mr. Harriman will be questioned further Monday .
