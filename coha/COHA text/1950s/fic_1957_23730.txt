A Story by William Eastlake Drawing by Gil Walker 1 - EM A ITR E was coming back . Now he was a city cowboy , riding out of the East back to the West . From the high mountain road he looked down at the bright country below , but he could not distinguish the blood-red adobe-built , northern New Mexico town of Coyote from the red earth around it . He could see only the yellowish new-wood construction of the rodeo grounds , the maze of fence , corral , and tower , virgin but faded  --  alien to a gaudy land . Lemaitre got back in his car  --  a powder-blue Imperial Chrysler pulling a regal , air-conditioned horse van done in quiet gold and small-lettered in caliph flourish , LEMAITRE . He took one last look at the judges ' tower rising below before he slammed the door . The tower of the judges ' the hog wire , were the watchers  --  the cowboys and Indians and Spanish-American farmers , caked already with the red dust , watching the prisoned animals in - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chutes , the final pens from which the animals and bronc people were shot into the arena . Near the tower a small boy made for the wire fence . The first time Sant had heard of the bronc people he was nine . Now , the first time he saw them , he was nine and a week . He crawled between the Indian wagons and under the fence and watched as the announcing man made the announcement . There was a hush over everyone as if a fuse had been lit . The big gate of the chute swung open , there was an explosion , and out shot the rider without the horse . They tried it again ; the announcing man made the announcement , a hush fell , there was the explosion , and out shot the horse without the rider . " In case you , some of you , ai n't never been to a rodeo before , " the announcing man announced , " they was supposed to come out together . Watch again , " he said , and someone behind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosion the horse and rider came out together , but only for an instant , only for the half second it took the horse to nucker into the earth and sling the man against the fence . The bronc man attempted wildly to land on his face , failed , and crashed all in a heap next to Sant . Slowly he unwound himself from his own wreckage until be reached a sitting and face-stroking , hard-thinking position . Sant leaned over , concerned , inquiring into the burning red face of the bronc man , " Is it tun ? " Now the announcing man had something else going  --  the steer-wrestling contest . A square steer shot out of the chute and made for the other end of the arena , chased by one of the bronc people on his blue quarter horse . Another bronc man rode on the other side of the steer so that the steer ran down an alley formed by the bronc people . Then one of the bronc men fell on the horns of the steer and wrestled him to earth , tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it happened it seemed it was the man who was tied up because it was the steer who walked off proud . The bronc people retrieved the man , gathered him up as if he were a sordid , soiled , discarded pile of old cowboy clothes and threw him , not without tenderness , behind the bull chute . Sant found him there reminiscing to himself of better days and ways . " Is n't this , " the bronc man said , " is n't this a hell of a way to make a living ? " " Is it fun ? " Sant insisted . S A N T now climbed the board barricade that surrounded the judges ' stand until he could look down at the corral maze below . He walked the fence maze , looking down on calf pen , hull pen , steer pen , horse pen , Brahma pen , cow pen , and , yes , here was a pig pen . Whatever did bronc people do with these ? What they did with these was to put a clutch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field ; then all the horse-mounted men came hell for leather , dismounted , grabbed a greased pig , remounted , held the flashing object high like Montezunia 's men the golden mantle , like offerings to the god , the animals flashing and screaming , fighting along the arms , upwards to the sun . Sant could not see from his position above the maze what they did with them finally . Maybe et them , he thought , or put them someplace first and won a prize . He had now reached the tower where the judges sat , way up in ultimate wisdom . They pulled on their chins and stroked their thighs and squirted down wild brown juice on lesser heads as wise men will . Sant slowly twisted and twined his way up the tower by the ladder the timbers funned to the seats of the judges . One of the judges leaned forward with solemn weight and raised a finger . The chute was flung open , the watchers yelled , and out plunged a Brahma bull , twisting to catapult the bronc man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroked his elk ring and placed a square of tobacco in his jaw before his ice-blue eyes , narrowed hard in awe , froze too . " If Jose Lucero Cipriano de Godoy is determined to get hisself kilt ? " one of the Anglo judges said and rubbed his horny hands together in a working gesture and finally relaxed as judges must . By climbing the boards in back of the judges ' stand Sant gained the top , the roof , and he looked out at the new world below , feeling within as small boys do , as Cortez did upon that peak . " Oh Lord ! Stay with him , Jose Lucero Cipriano de Godoy ! " Sant shouted . Away from the arena toward the mountain a plume of dust rose from the scar of road to the east . It was the arrival of Lemaitre , king of the cowboys  --  of the pulp novels anyhow , one of the judges thought , watching it , expecting it , although no one had had the courage to bill it . No one had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cousin of Lamaitre the King whose plume now feathered in the east . " He said lie might make it up on his way , iffen he had a mind to , on his way to sec the President , " Suds had told them . " President of what ? " someone asked . " The United States , " Suds said . " Then why would he stop here ? " " We 're kin . " " I see . Then he 'll stop here when the only place can afford him is Madison Square Gardens , the Cow Palace , and the Court of Something ? " " Saint James , he said , " Suds said . ' But we 're kin . " Sant watched the plume increase to tornado size as the entourage neared . Then the plume of fairy-red dust collapsed as the caravan paused , revealing the powder-blue Chrysler and the horse van . A loud hush fell over the arena as Lemaitre pulled in and parked his caravan , got out and stretched . " Cousin ! " Suds said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pick-up trucks and he advanced on Lemaitre as a committee of one . " This way , cousin , " Suds said and he conducted him among the abruptly silenced world ? even the animals now  --  to the board ladder that reached to the judges . Sant watched down as the big winged orange hat mounted toward him , then the face tilted up to check its progress . The clean hard slanting jaw of Lemaitre . Big as an axe , so close Sant could reach out a small monkey hand and touch it . The face of Lemaitre . " Howdy , pardner . " The voice of Lemaitre . Sant stared back without speech . The man bent down , entering the seats of the judges . The rear end of Lemaitre . Sant , safe now in the center of the roof where he had retreated ; moved a miniature grimed hand over an equally grimed face and whispered secretly , " Howdy , pardner . " The judges , now feeling judged , stood up and fumbled embarrassed for cigarettes and whiskey . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he read books and had no friends among the contestants  --  among anyone  --  leaned forward in sincere diffidence . " How , sir ? " he said . He stared at the man in the bat-winged orange hat , the two-hundreddollar alligator boots , and the green phosphorescent shirt that lit up at night and in the daytime too . " How , sir , are you ? " " Right smart , " Lemaitre said , and he took the judge 's seat , sprawled down into the chair , placed the alligators on the railing and splayed his jeweled hands , the hands that whipped a thousand broncs , on the rough pine arms of the judge 's seat . " Right nice of you to ask , " Lemaitre said . The crowd now had recovered enough to go off , to explode , to stampede , knock their children together , and toss whiskey bottles in the sun . The crowd settled into a rhythmic roar , " Lee Mater Lee Mater Lee Mater ! " The gaudy man finally rose from the rough pine seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowed in brilliant humility , and sat down with a nod that said that whatever they had been doing before he arrived they could continue to do it now . Sant could watch the gods without leaning over the edge . The two-by-twelve roof hoards had sun-crept apart so the structure was more a lattice than a roof , and he could look down on the shadow-striped gods with ease through the interstices and hear them if not understand . One of the judges who did not read things but was awfully social leaned forward and said to Lemaitre , " Sam Tollerfield wants to get hisself kilt . I hope he 's no kin . " " All men are kin , " Lemaitre said . Lord , the judge who read books thought , our hero 's a philosopher too . Lemaitre 's eyes narrowed on a palomino that looked fancy . The palomino knocked down the first barrel in the obstacle contest . " Yes , " another said . " Yes . We are all everyone 's children . " Lemaitre winced and winced again when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you meet a king ? " one of the judges said . " Now , you are a man who has met many kings . Now , what do you say when you meet a king ? " " Hello , " Lemaitre said . " Now , I mean , do they talk as we 're talking now , say the things we say  --  presidents and kings ? " " Yes , " Lemaitre said . " Well , but you 're kind of a king yourself , " an-other judge said . " King of the cowboys . What would they say if they was to meet ordinary people like us ? " " Hello , " Lemaitre said . " I mean if they was to meet us the second time , we 'd already had this conversation and they was to meet us the second time , what would they say ? " " Hello again , " Lemaitre said . " What we 're getting at , " the tallest judge said , " is you mean that if you met us again ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you was to meet us again all you 'd say was hello again ? You 'd treat us like dirt ? " " Yes , yes , " Lemaitre said . " Anything . " Sant retired from his crack to the middle of the roof self-consciously and scratched his ear . They should show more respect for Lemaitre . N 0 W Sant watched the horses that were swimming in the tight corral below . They had whipped up a circular motion and flowed loose , intertwined and clockwise without touching the boards , the crimson dirt fluid and spraying out , reddening the judges ' stand , with a stud 's mouth sharklike leaping out and up toward the blue sky , then falling hack into the pool of red and flowing horses as if a fish had been wounded and turned the water thus , the horses churning , still-white teeth snapping and bright in the overwhelming sun , the quiet , whipped dust settling upon Sant from the vortex beneath his feet , his eyes trying to count and failing . Now he selected a white mare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mad churning , deep aquarium of horses , " lowee ! " Sant said . And now the announcing man , whose name , STACEY , was written on his shirt , announced that his father had driven a stage through this country way back when times were desper-atea stage without wheels , without any wheels , folks . And how was it held up , folks ? Well , it was held up by bandits . " Now , " a judge said , " would n't Stace go over big in New York City , New York ? " " In New York City , New York . Yes , " Lemaitre said . Sant watched , below , some gaudy-rigged cowboys beginning to work on the killer . The killer horse was not in the aquarium with the others but prisoned in a heavy cell of logs that fitted him exactly . They had brought him off the mountain yesterday with seven ropes and twelve horses . He had never been ridden . Rumor had it he had killed five men . Actually he had killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the mountain once before , last year , to sell to a city rodeo , but the city man , the buyer , said , " Hell , that 's not a horse , it 's an electric chair . It would be an execution , not a bronc ride . Keep the down payment and wait till my truck gets five miles away before you turn him loose . " No one knew where the horse came from . He had suddenly appeared on the mountain one day , full , enormous , black . All the people and half the dogs from Coyote had climbed up to see him . The mangled , bloodied remains of an ancient , high-backed Spanish saddle hung downwards around his belly , and a man , quickly killed , went toward him with a rope . On Spanish fiesta days when the town was lighted with provoking torches for the feast of San Antonio , the killer was sure to come off the mountain and tear through the streets , scattering the pilgrims and sending the dark-robed people retreating hack into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was Free ? The crowd at the rodeo knew what was lip . The crowd had quietly turned into a mob , no longer going off in individual shouting , whims , and directions but all intent now on helping the men with the ropes and poles and pick-ups strain and inch the killer into the chute . " The great Lemaitre will now favor us country folks with a ride , " the announcer said flatly and evenly , and he removed his hat . Sant looked through the cracks . Lemaitre seemed to have collapsed . He seemed to be holding one hand on the other hand to keep it from moving , but only for an instant , then he placed the bad hand in his pocket to make it behave and with the good hand he reached slowly up to the Bull Durham label drooping from his electric shirt , removed the sack , and made a cigarette with one hand . He blew out a cloud of smoke and r-emoved the bad hand and it seemed good again , fie looked , narrow-eyed , down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swearing , pushing men were trying to work the big black forward into the chute . A fenced alley led from his prison to the chute beneath the judges ' stand , but he would not go . They prodded and heaved him forward with ropes , squeezing and pulling until they reached parallel posts at four-foot intervals in the alley , then they placed a log through the fence on the forward side of the post so the big black could not retreat , and then they swore and heaved him to the next post . In this fashion they finally got him to the chute , whereupon he smashed the log they held him with and backed back to his prison where he waited . They began again , this time with a larger crew , larger log , larger cussing , gayer hats , and this time three men with three horses pulled from ropes out in the arena until the big black was safely chutedcussed , sweated , pulled , and prodded  --  until the gates at both ends of the chute were sealed . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all ready . We can commence as soon as they get this strap tied around his back you can hold onto . " The judge paused . " Like as not they 'll try ns for murder and yet it was they , " he indicated the mob , " asked for it . Demanded it . " " Listen , " the fattest judge said , " I can raise my finger , turn him back . It will be all right with them . They 'll all laugh and go home happy . They 'll have had their joke . " He watched Lemaitre . Lemaitre was slumped down in the big pine chair in advance of the judges , slumped there between the people and the judges . To catch the eye of the fattest judge he had to roll back his head and look partly upward and into the face of Sant . Their eyes gripped together a full instant , then Lemaitre leaned far back and caught the judge 's eye , hesitated , then said quietly , " No . No , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " another judge said . " They do n't care . They 'll take their satisfaction either way . " S A N T ceased looking down , looked up at the over-powering sky , and scratched his head . Lemaitre began to roll another cigarette . " Maybe , maybe not , " Lemaitre said . " Maybe we got to do what we 're expected to do . The horse is ready , expecting me . The people are expecting we . " He looked down . " Particularly the horse . To keep the horse waiting ? " he fretted the cigarette and placed it in his mouth , " it would n't be polite . " Below the men were trying to get the sur-tingle around the horse . Sant watched as they slipped the strap through the crack in the boards beneath the horse 's furious belly . The man on the other side of the chute reached in , cautiously , deliberately , to intercept the strap . The horse fired out his hooves like a shot and the man fell . " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 'll he all right , folks , " he said as they pulled the man beneath the shade of an Indian wagon , waved fans in his face , and applied things to the slow trickle of blood . - Here 's the horse what did the shooting , fired that cannon , folks . Well , " the announcing man paused , " let 's have a moment 's silence in memory . " The announcing man sat down and Sant watched as Lemaitre worked on the had hand again , held it to keep it from moving , then finally placed it in his pocket , blew out a huge cloud of smoke and waved it away with his good hand , leaned back and winked up at Sant . Now another volunteer rushed forward , uncoiled a long piece of baling wire , and fished down between the boards and beneath the great horse , and speared the strap and passed it up to the man atop the barricade and above the horse . The man above the horse reached over to the other side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Folks , he should n't have done it , " the announcing man announced . The horse had fired again , raising up in his chute to twice his height . He jackknifed. and shot the man clean over two Indian wagons , a pick-up , twenty bales of hay , and a Coca Cola stand . The man landed and bounced twice in the red dust and then , without ceasing his movement  --  he was running now  --  he made toward the hills , followed by his wife , an only child , and an old Indian retainer who chased zigzag and kicking like all antelope as though pursued  --  all four ? of them shouting and shouted to , distant and disappearing , hushed at last in the far hills a mile and one half from where the black horse stood contained , recoiled again , and trembling for other victims . " Well , folks , that was n't nice . " The announcing man paused and watched Lemaitre . " Maybe we should n't ask a II  --  all with a city reputation to ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcer seemed to be reconsidering , tapping quietly with a stick on the railing in front of him . " No , folks , I mean this . Let 's go home , call it off . You 've had your fun . " The crowd booed , " I wash my hands . " The announcing man stepped aside and the show seemed over . People began to move toward the trucks and wagons . " One moment , " Lemaitre stood where the announcing man had stood . " One moment . We got one more rider . " Then Lemaitre began to climb down the judges ' stand toward the chute . The crowd paused , not going on to their trucks or back Co their wagons but hanging  --  there watching . Sant beat Lemaitre to the chute , swinging down the tower like a monkey . As Lemaitre neared the chute he saw Sant talking to and stroking the head of the horse . When he got to the chute Sant was down there below the horse someplace , disappeared beneath the barricade , beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse gibberish . Now Sant passed up both ends of the strap to Lemaitre waiting above the horse . With the same movement of taking the strap Lemaitre grabbed Sant 's wrist and gave it , not a pull or even jerk , but a flip that landed Sant on a pile of hay ten yards away . " The horse might get bored with your conversation . We do n't want to push the luck . " Now the horse gave a high gyrating lunge that shook the stands as Lemaitre tightened the surcingle and Sant regained the barricade . Some other volunteers too now crept up to the barricade with advice . " Do n't , " they said in chorus . " Oh , " Lemaitre said , looking down on the horse . " It 's too late . " T H E horse with one great series of furious kicks was toppling the barricade . As the barricade fell , dissolved in huge splinters , the men leaped clear and Sant remained standing in the air . Lemaitre on his way down to gain the horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kept him in his right hand and grabbed the surcingle with his left . Together they shot straight upwards into the nearing sun , Sant held even further upward like some trophy , up and up until they seemed to stall at leaving the earth and glide heavy downward and hit to rise up again and again , like some wing-broken bird failing above tree height . Now the horse in huge bird fashion laid a serpentine pattern in the sky so that those on the occasional ground on which he hit fled under the trucks and wagons to watch safely the three up there that all came down together in unexpected places . The horse now tried the earth , careening like a mad jet , earth-bound at sudden right angles and with awful breaks to fling the riders over the mountain . Rut they seemed now part of the horse , even as they left the arena , flew over the fence like Pegasus , and made toward town . The audience emerged to watch the three nailed together tear around through Coyote before threatening them again with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final flight in the air . Then the horse quit . Lemaitre stepped off , still holding Sant high and precious as though they were leaving a rocket to the moon . The mob was still stunned , noiseless , as Lemaitre lcd the horse with a nose hold into the quiet gold air-conditioned trailer and bolted the door with a combination lock , placed Sant in the front seat alongside him in the powder-blue Imperial , and drove off . Lemaitre held the wheel and made a cigarette with the other hand . Then he looked at Sant. - We won him , " he said . They rode hushed between huge yellow rocks in the red earth , smelling the pure New Mexico air , feeling the huge space around them , sensing a roof now as they entered beneath cottonwoods at the sulphur springs , then passed between the low clay mounds which looked like melting elephants , then emerged finally , climbing and gliding into bright hills the horse had known . " He 'll get used to being a bronc horse , " Lemaitre said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primped . He 'll get used to the aquarium . " Lemaitre paused . " You think he earned his freedom then . You think we should turn him back loose . You think with all the catering and feed and primping there is nothing worse than not freedom . " Lemaitre studied the lost cliffs in the pure distance and dropped the twisted Bull Durham stem into the ash box . Sant stared ahead in childish profundity , thinking of nothing . Then he said as though absent , " You 're studying ? ? " " Maybe , " Lemaitre said . " But I 'm driving you home wherever you live . " " The Circle Heart Ranch on your way back to Albuquerque . " " Yes , maybe so , " Lemaitre said as though listening for another voice . " Yes . I guess maybe that 's it . I guess that 's the worst there is . " " The Circle Heart ? " Sant said . " No , " Lemaitre said , and he stopped the car and got out and fiddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a great noise , kind of a smooth rushing of wings into the high hills , and then Le-maitre got back in and said , " Not freedom . That 's what it was . That 's what I was studying . " They rode now through the darkening hills in their shared secret , their mutual conspiracy , as though together they had broken jails for strangers . They had released him who had tried to murder them ; against justice , against all man-laws of not freedom , they had conspired together and were linked as one in the act . " My card , " Lemaitre said , proffering Sant a small paper . " Maybe one day , you never know , maybe one day you 'll want to join the bronc people . Look me up . Lemaitre 's the name . " " Sant 's the name , " Sant said , taking the card . The car paused in front of the gates marked The Circle Heart . Sant got out and watched the dazzling caravan pull away down the Tong road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowman , " Sant said . The boy started down a cow-trail short-cut to the main house , the path beaten hard by the passing herds and the punishing sun . Now he entered a grove , a thicket of tamarisk trees and greasewood brush and came upon a sudden deer . The buck paused , staring in wild disbelief before he turned , and whipped imperiously off . As the buck leaped he flashed his white card of tail . Now the two , shocking each other in sudden encounter , were fled as quickly as they were joined . As Sant began to enter the house gate his mother came fluttering . " Where 've you been , boy ? " She had Indian blood and generally did n't excite this easily . " Where 've you been ? " " Up there , " Sant said , pointing to the tough sun , the clean distant sky . " Come , boy , " she said , still fluttering . " Where you been ? " " Here , " Sant said , taking out the small white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said still pointing . " Up there where I 've been telling you . And I 've got that paper , " he said , watching the card she examined . " I 've got that paper to prove it . "
