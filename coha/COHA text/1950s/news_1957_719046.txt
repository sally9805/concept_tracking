txt The French are being illogical : they are having a financial crisis in the midst of a boom . They never had it so good , but they are close to fiscal bankruptcy and forced devaluation of the franc . Vitality , knowhow , hard work , a high rate of ? capital investment , higher private consumption , a sensational increase in productivity per man hour , a rise in real wages , even a high birth rate which is a recent and healthy phenomenon in France  --  are all providing a degree of prosperity calculated to make the average Frenchman happyAll the same , his country is facing a grave crisis . It lies in , the field of Government finances , foreign trade , a weakened currency , inflation and the heavy cost of fighting to keep Algeria . The French : franc has declined sharply in recent days on the open market , which is the real gauge of its strength .. It touched 439 to the dollar yesterday - in New York and was as low as 445 on Monday . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already discounting a devaluation of more or less this order , but devaluation without taking proper measures to protect the new level would simply mean paving the way for another devaluation later . Such measures are what Felix Gaillard , the dynamic young French Minister of Finance , is fighting for , and he is supposed to get his answer from a Cabinet meeting in Paris today . The basic problem is that imports have increased much faster than exports , yet the business boom . depends on these imports . Put in its crudest form , France 's dilemma is : austerity or inflation ? M. Gaillard says austerity ; his colleagues do not say inflation , but they argue that too sudden a deflation , can halt or slow down the economic expansion . The search has been for the sort of " accommodation " for which French politics are famous . This is an especially weak Government and Ministers and Deputies feel politically vulnerable . It takes eourage to introduce ncasures of austerity . The French ) eople , for all their undoubted vir.ues , have a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British . Faced with a somewhat similar problem in the immediate post-war era , the British went in for a program of austerity that , with good reason , astonished and awed the world . Yet even in that period tna Labor Governments had the baffling problem of convincing the workers that there was a grave fiscal and exchange problem . The l3ritish laborer was better off than ever in history and there was no unemployment to speak of . So when the Govarnment uttered cries of warning and dismay , the worker said : " What crisis ? I do n't see any . " The French workman is saying just that . The big employers may know better , but they , too , are reaping rich harvests , and they hate to see the process tampered with . The small business man , the small farmer , the white-collar class are suffering , as they always do in a period of inflation .

Yet there are a lot of such men in , France , and they control a lot of votes , aside from their right to consideration . So here , too , economics becomes politics . M. Gaillard is certainly showing courage and determination . Some of his colleagues question whether he is showing an equal amount of good sense , especially on the political side . His program is orthodox  --  cut Government expenditures , reduce private consumption by increased sales taxes and cutting Government subsidies , thus allowing some prices to rise , hold wages down , reduce the budget by 600 billion francs , of which he now seems to have agreemnt on all but ten billion francs . The next question is whether such a program could work , especially when it comes to restraining wages while prices rise . The answers to the French crisis are not simple , but at least the decisions are being made by a strong France .                  @ @ @
