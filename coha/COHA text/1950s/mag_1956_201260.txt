Murder used to be all a mystery novelist needed to get on with his story . The new whodunits stick to that main tent at traction , but beckon the jaded customers with such lurid little sideshows as sadism , pandering , homosexuality , counterfeiting , prostitution , adultery and grave-robbing . <P> DEAD STORAGE , by George Bagby ( 191 pp. ; Crime Club ; $2.75 ) , describes in repellent detail the last hours of a prosperous pimp , and introduces as ugly a set of murder suspects as the season has offered . The case is tackled by Inspector Schmidt of New York Homicide , whose homey habit of taking off his pinching shoes in moments of stress somehow makes the sordid details of the crime seem more wholesome . <P> THE SECOND CURTAIN , by Roy Fuller ( 172 pp. ; Macmillian ; $2.75 ) , the work of a British attorney who has published five volumes of verse , attempts to be both a novel of character and a novel of suspense , is above average in both categories . The plot : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an old school chum and gradually finds himself being followed , spied on , threatened with death . The shabbier fringes of London 's literary life are convincingly drawn , and the ending is a real shocker . <P> JEOPARDY , by Manfred Conte ( 278 pp. ; Sloane ; $3.50 ) , contains enough interesting research on the hazards of counterfeiting and passing bogus $100 bills to discourage any hopeful amateur .

Unfortunately , he runs into a stretch of overwritten bad luck with thieving , deceitful or suspicious-acting ladies . His professional life is a lot more entertaining than his love life . <P> MADAM , WILL You TALK ? , by Mary Stewart ( 250 pp. ; Mill and Morrow ; 3.50 ) , a fast chase in polished prose , is an outstandingly sleek example of the femnine first-personer ( " Had I but known . . . " ) . Colorfully painted backdrops of provincial France and the Marseille waterfront are a good contrast to the nice young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue.s <P> THE BLACK AND THE RED , by Elliot Paul ( 277 pp. ; Random House ; $2.75 ) , is a Homer Evans mystery by the author of The Mysterious Mickey Finn and Hugger-Mugger in the Louvre . It is for longtime Elliot Paul fans only ; latecomers who are merely looking for a story are likely to bog down in the aggressive whimsy and the interminable dissertations on art , sex and French cooking . <P> THE MAN IN MY GRAVE , by Wilson Tucker ( 250 pp. ; Rinehart ; $2.75 ) , is not much of a mystery after the first chapters , but it is notable for an unusual hero and some fascinating details about the unpleasant profession of burking. * B. G. Brooks is a mild-mannered little investigator for a trade association of cemetery owners . He always carries an umbrella , lets off steam by exclaiming " Gracious , me ! " and " Oh , dear ! " but is a dangerous man for villains to tangle with . <P> EXIT CHARLIE , by Alex Atkinson ( 221 pp. ; Knopf ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of actors playing repertory in an English village . Leading Man Charles Manion fails to show up for his curtain call one evening because it appears that he has been done in by some member of his company .
