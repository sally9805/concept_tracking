txt A recommendation that the International Longshoremen 's Association and two of its chief officials be adjudged guilty of civil and criminal contempt of court was made yesterday . Former Federal Judge Simon H. Rifkind , sitting as a special referee of the State Supreme Court , took this action after hearing testimony that they had disobeyed a court order forbidding last September 's costly waterfront strike : . Mr , Rifkind found that Capt . William V. Bradley , president of the unaffiliated union , had violated the restraining order on four occasions , and that Thomas ( Teddy ) Gleason , its general organizer had violated the order once . He recommended that Patrick J. ( Packy ) Connolly , executive vice president , and Fred R. Field ' Jr. , president of the union 's New York District Council , be adjudged not guilty . In his thirty-eight-page interlocutory report Mr. Rifkind declared : " It is difficult to conceive any act more contumacious of the restraining order than Bradley 's official strike call of Sept. 12 , 1955 . " As evidenced by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only with full knowledge of the fact that the act he was commiting was expressly forbidden , but with awareness of the possible punitive consequences to himself and the union . " New Hearings Scheduled Mr. Rifkind scheduled further hearings at his office , 575 Madison Avenue , for 10 A. M. , Jan. 20 , to " determine the nature and measure of the penalties to be recommended . " He will then submit his final report and recommendations to State Supreme Court Justice S. Samuel DiFalco , who appointed him referee in the case . The contempt charges were based on the union 's failure to obey a restraining order issued by Justice DiFalco last Sept. 7 , the first day of the eight-day strike . The restraining order was handed down upon the application of the New York Shipping Association , which represents virtually all of the steamship lines and contracting stevedores that employ longshore labor here . The association simultaneously filed a 10,000,000 damage suit against the union , contending the strike was in violation of the collective bargaining agreement that it did not involve a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated the restraining order on four counts : " A ? By directing members of the I. L. A. not to return to work on Sept. 8 , 1955 . " B ? By a public statement " , made on Sept. 9 , 1955 , reaffirm // ing his statement of Sept. 8 , 1955 , directing the men not to return to work . " C ? By issuing orders on Sept. 12 , 1955 ; to all locals and members directing them to engage lin a strike against the plaintiff New York Shipping Association . " D ? By statements made during a radio broadcast on Sept. 112 , 1955 , directing members of IL L. A. to obey the strike order issued on that day . " The referee ruled that Mr. ' Gleason had violated the order " in the course of a radio broadcast made on Sept. 12 , 1955 . " Mr. Rif kind recommended that the union be adjudged guilty " in that it willfully violated the restraining order of this court by the acts of its officers and agents . " Finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Gleason He reported that " from first to last the strike had nothing to do with contract clauses or any other legitimate labor-management controversy . " He declared : " Simply stated , the strike was not waged against the association or its members , but against the Waterfront Commission and the New York-New Jersey Waterfront Compaq . " Its calculated purpose was political , not economic : to force Government officials to adopt a course of action desired by the union . " A spokesman for the union said last night there would be no comment on Mr. Rifkind 's ruling at this time . The office of John T. Sullivan , the lawyer who presented the union 's case during hearings before Mr. Rifkind last October , said he was out of town and would not rereturn until tomorrow . Observers noted that the date set by Mr. Rifkind to determine the penalties he will recommend was just. , five da , ys , after , : theunion is scheduled to receive an estimated $400,000 to $500,000 loan from the Eastern , Central and Southern Conferences of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stattitory upper limit on fines for organizations found guilty of contempt of court . That touched off speculation that a heavy fine , if recommended by Mr. Rifkind and ordered by Justice DiFalco , could take away from the I. L. A. ' the entire amount of the loan ) and more . The possibility was also seen that the teamster conferences might defer or cancel the loan in view of this new ' turn . Attack on Dewey Assailed In another waterfront development , Peter Megargee Brown , a former assistant United States Attorney in charge of the Federal waterfront investigation and esnior assistant counsel to the State Crime Commission during its port inquiry , lashed out at Godfrey P. Schmidt , chairman of the Citizens Waterfront Committee . Mr. Brown , who is now in private practice , said that the chairman of the unofficial group " has wrongfully attacked the record of former Gov . Thomas E. Dewey 's war on waterfront gangsters . " The feud began last week when Mr. Brown told the New York Young Republican Club that things on the docks were " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interference " by Governor Harriman . On Monday , during the regular session of the citizens committee , Mr. Schmidt commented that Mr. Brown might have been morethe point if he complained that Mr. Dewey had not interfered years ago and enforced the laws that were then on the books . Mr. Brown declared yesterday that Mr. Dewey , as Governor , " did more than any other person to rid the port of river racketeers and to restore port prosperity and peace . " Mr. Brown declared that in the light of " Mr. Dewey 's clear record of vigorous service , Mr. Schmidt 's attack on Governor Dewey 's faithful efforts to clean up the port is wholly unjustified . " In reference to Mr. Schmidt 's comment that the proper place to present evidence was before duly constituted public authority , Mr. Brown said that he was going to appear before the Brooklyn waterfront grand jury at 10:30 A. M. today . He said he had been invited to present his views on waterfront conditions by Assistant District Attorney Aaron E. Koota.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
