Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian did not overstate the case by much . In 1954 the Canadian team lost in the world finals to the Russians , and the defeat was blown up into a national calamity . It happened again in the last Winter Olympics at Cortina . So the Canadians had been sent to Norway to win . Every move they made was part of a carefully calculated plan to defeat the Soviet Union on ice . The Whitby roster included two former big league pros ( Sid Smith and Jean Paul Lamirande ) who had been reinstated as amateurs. // So now it was a cold clear night in Jordal Amfi Stadium at Oslo , and operation Beat Russia had succeeded . Some 11,500 fans were packed in cramped rows . The cold ate into the bones of those who stood on eight inches of plank during five hours of bitter weather . ( The Norwegians frown on the kind of warmth that comes out of a bottle . There 's a strict rule that anyone caught with a jug will be escorted out into the parking lot . ) The frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence while the Canadian ensign moved slowly toward the top of the flagstaff to the strains of O Canada . Harry Sinden , the stocky captain of the Canadian team , felt a tug at his sweater . Looking down , he saw the gold tooth of the grizzled Soviet Captain Nikolai Sologubov gleaming up at him impulsively . Sinden bussed the Russian on his red neck . The crowd roared its approval , because these rivals had been tearing each other apart for at least 40 of 60 nerve-shattering minutes before Canada had captured the big game with the U.S.S.R. 4-2. // The Canadians had punished the Russkies with crashing body checks . But if the Russians were hurt they refused to show it . To confess injury would have been to admit the Canadian strategy was succeeding , for the Canadians had to slow the Moscow express down to their own speed if they hoped to win . What had looked like a comparatively soft touch had turned out to be a grim struggle . On paper , it had seemed easy to figure . In six previous games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But hockey is n't played on paper . Five minutes after Norway 's King Olav took his rail seat , accompanied by his beautiful daughter , Princess Astrid , the Russians were swarming over the Canadians like locusts . This was the period in which the Russians had a chance to run up a score . They got only one goal for their superiority , scored while Canada had a man in the penalty box . // Penalties came close to being the downfall of the hard rocks from Canada . In their eagerness to flag down the U.S.S.R. they resorted to tactics permitted under the Canadian code but frowned on by the International Federation . At one stage of that desperate first period they had two men doing penance while the Reds were at full strength , but the Russians muffed this big opportunity . // Could the Russians maintain their blistering pace for 60 minutes ? The answer came early in the second period . Russian skaters got up more slowly when knocked down , Russian raids became less frequent . Canada now was taking command , but scoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Charlie Burns , a slender lad with a metal plate in his skull to remind him of an old hockey injury , broke into the clear . They had the Russian goalie , Nikolay Puchkov , at their mercy , but he outguessed them , the puck was blocked and Puchkov overturned the cage to get a breather . Then the Canadians got the break they needed . Nikolai Khlystov , a tiring winger , drew a penalty for tripping . A moment later Bobby Attersley , a blond magician with stick and puck , flipped in the tying goal . The Canadians forged to the front when Former Pro Connie Broden again beat Puchkov , but the Russians still had one punch left . Konstantin Loktev tied the score . But the Canadians were in the driver 's seat by this time . Two goals within 25 seconds settled the issue . // Canada had regained her place at the top of the totem pole , but the hockey world had renewed its respect for the Russians . No team ever gave a gamer display or accepted bitter defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who like to improvise and experiment with their equipment . Most of them carry an oilstone in their kit . They use it to finish off sharpening their skates . Canadian and American players like their skates rockered to give them greater maneuverability , but the Russians prefer to have the bottom of their skate blade flat . They get greater speed that way . The sticks are manufactured from what the Russians call buk wood , which comes from the Caucasus , and are much lighter than those used by other nations . On the ice , though , the Russians are members of the most mechanical team in Europe . Speed and precision are their trademarks on skates . The friendly , sandy-haired Anatoli Tarasov , their coach , is a military man . The head of all hockey in Russia is also a military man , and the team 's play reflects military thinking . When the club 's patriarch , 33-year-old Nikolai Sologubov , a junior lieutenant in the Red Army , wheels the puck around the Russian net , he knows without looking that little Vladimir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks from their own zone , with forwards hurtling into enemy territory , are the comrades ' main offensive weapons . Then they fan out , with one man always parked in front of the net to interfere with the goalie 's vision and harass him as much as possible . Their defense men move down to provide heavy artillery . In Ivan Tregubov , handsome , dark-haired and swarthy , and Genrich Sidorenkov the Russians have two of the hardest shooters in hockey . When Sidorenkov uncorks his favorite slap shot the puck looks like a cough drop as it whizzes toward the unfortunate goalie. // But precision is perfection only to a point . When it becomes a pattern it 's liable to be a weakness . Lynn Patrick , general manager of the Boston Bruins , scouting the Oslo games in the hope of picking up big league prospects , said : " Because they 're so well trained , they pass without looking . They know there will be a man there to receive it , but they do n't know if someone from the other team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I 'm knocking them , I 'll tell you how much I like them . There are five players on their team who can move up to the Bruins , and there 's a commission of $2,500 for anyone who can get either Sologubov or Tregubov into Boston . " // Earlier in the week , an undermanned U.S. squad had shown it had the know-how to baffle the U.S.S.R. , too , but it lacked the horses . The Yanks ' leading goal-getter , Johnny Mayasich of Eveleth , Minn. , playing with only one hand on the stick , had suffered a badly bruised shoulder muscle against the Swedes . When that happened , American Coach Calvin Marvin of Warroad , Minn , muttered , " There goes the ball club . " Marvin had only five men on his bench for this ice battle . A near-capacity crowd , which included King Olav , was definitely pro-Yank but got little chance to cheer . Only once did it appear that fans might get some extracurricular East-West action . Gordon Christian , also of Warroad , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. squad , clashed along the boards with Red Army Officer Alexandrov Cherepanov . Christian was testing his teeth to see if they had been shaken from their moorings . At center ice the two players stopped and began to reconstruct in sign language the crimes of which each accused the other . Spectators guffawed as Cherepanov plainly indicted the Yank of attempting to separate his head from his shoulders . Christian had some companions examine his bridgework . The diagnosis must have been disturbing , because he advanced toward the penalty pen shaking his stick menacingly at the Russian . A towering Norwegian ended the war of nerves by leading the Yank to the coop and then sitting between him and the Red officer while the U.S. lost 4-1 . The Russian game caused additional gaps in the American ranks . U.S. manager Don Clark , looking forward to his two-game exhibition invasion of the U.S.S.R. which is due to follow the tournament , sadly surveyed his handful of survivors and cracked , " This is probably the most battered army that ever marched on Moscow .
