txt A $25,000,000 claim for damages in the sinking of the liner Andrea Doria was filed in Federal Court yesterday by her Italian owners . The Italian Line asked the court to deny the Swedish American Line 's petition , filed earlier this week , for exoneration of the liner Stockholm in the crash . The Italian document questioned the Swedish Line 's right to seek a limitation of liability and made public the Italian Line 's official description of the moments leading up to the disaster forty-five miles south of Nantucket Island on the night of July 25 . In a statement issued ' as the two legal documents were made public , Dr. Giuseppe Ali , general manager of the line here , questioned - whether the Stockholm 's master was on his bridge when the two ships met and the smaller 1Stockholm plowed forty feet into the heart of the Italian vessel . The first document was the company 's own claim for damages , which the attorneys for the line said- were estimated at $25,000,000 . The second answered point by point the petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new clue to the sinking of the Andrea Doria was noted in the Italian Line 's description of the accident . After penetrating the starboard side of the Andrea Doria , the jagged bow of the Swedish ship raked back along the side of the Doria , widening the gap . Naval architects have puzzled over the twenty-five-degree list that the Andrea Doria took at the moment of impact , a list that increased steadily until she went over and down eleven hours after the crash . She was built to standards called for in the 1948 International Convention for Safety - at Sea , and should have remained " stable " or relatively level , even with two of her eleven watertight compartments flooded . Tile grinding of the torn bow steel of the Stockholm may have opened the wound further aft on the starboard side than was initially believed . One view that would reject this thesis , however , was based by naval architects on the slowness with which the Doria sank . Before she went down all but forty-five of the 1,709 passengers and seamen on board were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOS . Denies Moon Was Shining The Italian Line 's answer to the Swedish petition reiterated some of the denials and charges made on Wednesday , when Dr. Ali held a press conference . , 1But there were additional points . The answer denied , for example , that the moon was shining as the ships approached . The question of weather had been a disputed point between the two companies , the Swedish Line contending that the moon was out and that there was a haze , but visibility was good . The Andrea Doria , Swedish officers said , was sighted two miles away . Andrea Doria officers said they had been ik-fog for eight hours and that it was still foggy . The Italian version varies also in the relative positions of the ships a few moments before the crash . The Swedish claim was that the Stockholm could see the Doria off her port bow and that she could see the Doria 's port , or red , running light . In the Italian version the ships met with the Stockholm approaching on the Doria 's righthand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liner slightly north of the Doria 's course . Another point disputed yesterday was the Swedish contention that the Doria 's white masthead lights were " open " to indicate a Doria right-hand turn . This would have permitted the ships to pass port to port , that is , left to left . In such a situation " open " refers to the vertical position of two white lights , one on the forward mast and a second on the aft mast . The second light is some fifteen feet higher than the ' first . also claimed an unstated sum as " indemnity or contribution " from the Swedish American Line for all sums the Italian Line may be called upon to pay for deaths , injuries or losses suffered as a result of the disaster . Next week the Italian Line will file its own formal petition to the court for a limitation of liability . Yesterday Judge Lawrence E. Walsh , who has been sitting in the case in Federal Court , conferred with attorneys representing the disputing ship lines . Depositions to Be Taken An agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beginning on Sept. 19 . A chronological order was established for examination of the officer or officers having responsibility for navigation of the ships from the time each became aware of the other 's presence until ' the time of collision . The responsible Stockholm officers will be questioned first , followed by the responsible Doria officers . Next will be " other officers and crew of the Stockholm " and " other officers and crew of the Andrea Doria . " The examinations will adhere to trial . procedures , with direct and cross-examination . On . Aug. 20 the . logs of both ships " to the extent that they exist , " must be - made available forexamination , together with all other documents relating to the collision . This would include ' the course recorders , stylus devices that trace on tape every maneuver a ' ship makes . These were saved , as were the ship logs . Capt .

When a seaman sees two lights dead ahead and on an , exact vertical line they . tell him the exact line of the keel of the approaching ship . If the lower , forward light , is to the viewer 's left ( and hence . is seen- to the left of the after and higher light ) , then the ship coming , on is turning to her own starboard , and will pass to the viewer 's left side . The mast lights are then said to be open . The Swedish version is that the Stockholm saw that the Doria was turning away to the Stockholm 's port , so she veered slightly to starboard to widen the apparent clearance . The Italian version is the op ? posite : that the Stockholm was already directed to the Doria 's righthand side , so the Doria veered to the left , also to widen the seeming clearance . Hence , both ships , the Stockholm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south for the doomed meeting . In its announcement . the Italian .
