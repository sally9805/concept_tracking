Can-Can ( music &; lyrics by Cole Porter ; book by Abe Burrows ) is a period musical in the good but also the bad sense of the word . It often captures the rakish , even the Lautrec-ish animation of Paris in the ' 905 , but it has often , too , the feeble plotting and labored prattle of memory-book musicomedy . Actually a number of things in it merit high praise , but these do not include such trifles as the music , the lyrics or the libretto . <P> The music is pleasant enough , but not close to par for Cole Porter : it has a " school of Cole Porter " air . The lyrics would not be a credit to anyone , and for Porter they fall woefully flat . Abe Burrows ' book , largely concerned with the love of a priggish young judge ( Peter Cookson ) and a prancing , Montmartre Jezebel , rises only once-in a funny duel scene-from banality to Burrows . <P> These drawbacks out of the way-except that they never are for long-Can-Can whirls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , studios and dives are charmingly evocative , and Michael Kidd has worked up the best dances of the season . There is a fine , hair-dragging apache number , a legsome cancan , and an enchanting , Garden of Eden ballet spoof , full of flamingoes , frogs and inchworms , as well as Eve and the serpent . As Eve ( and several other things ) , red-headed Gwen Verdon has a wonderfully fetching dance personality ; as the Jezebel , Paris ' blonde Lilo has lots of voice , as well as personality . Thanks to these girls and the can-can spirit , the show has genuine sex , if only the most intermittent sparkle .
