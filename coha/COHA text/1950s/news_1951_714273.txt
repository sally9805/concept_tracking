txt The sleepy Channel isle of Sark has scored another victory in its battle with the modern world and banned airplanes from landing in the island 's feudal glens . Sark 's 600 residents took one look at the black headlines proclaiming the world 's grim events , shuddered appropriately . passed a new resolution against modernity and dozed back into the dreamy serenity they have known since feudal times . They decreed the airplane , as an agent of the atomic age , had no place on the island still governed by a court which was established in feudal times and rules the three-mile-long chunk of land between Britain and France under a colorful " grand seigneur . " In fact , they said , the airplane was even more subversive than the automobile which was banned from Sark when Henry Ford was still a young man to keep it from " corrupting " the island . The ban followed the attempt of two British fliers who set a possible record for the longest overwater flight in a helicopter-115 miles  --  to set down on Sark.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
