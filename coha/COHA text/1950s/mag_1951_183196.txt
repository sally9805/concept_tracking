Running through all the MacArthur hearing testimony was one official Administration explanation for the Yalta concessions to Russia . The justification was military : the U.S. had to coax Russia into the war against Japan , and at the earliest hour , to reduce what were expected to be large U.S. casualties in assaulting the Japanese islands . <P> " By No Means United . " Last week a Republican Senator got wind of a paper which seemed to show that not all the U.S. military had shared that view . The evidence was a secret intelligence report prepared for Army Chief of Staff George Marshall in April 1945 , two months after Yalta . It was prepared in the Specialists ' Section of Army G2 , a high-powered team of some 50 experts , most of them West Pointers , each a lieutenant colonel or better , each a specialist on some country or region of the world . Heading the project was the late Colonel Joseph Michela . The report , said the Senator , warned emphatically against bringing Russia into the Asiatic war and foretold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Major points : <P> " . . . The U.S. and Great Britain , without further help , possess the power to force unconditional surrender from Japan . . . " <P> " The U.S. should make no political or economic concession to Soviet Russia to bring about or prevent an action which she is fully determined to make anyway . " <P> " The entry of Russia . . . would destroy America 's position in Asia ... as our position is now destroyed in Europe east of the Elbe and beyond the Adriatic . " <P> " ... China will ... become the Poland of Asia , Korea the Asiatic Rumania and Manchoukuo the Soviet Bulgaria . " <P> ' ' The U.S. Army is by no means united in believing it wise to encourage the Soviet Union into the Asiatic war . " <P> At the bottom was a single recommendation : the President should summon General MacArthur from the Pacific to get his views on the matter ; " all other political and military personages should be excluded from this conference . " <P> Missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the report . And the men who put it together apparently did not know ( as even some key members of the entourage at Yalta were not told ) what had already been secretly given to Stalin at Yalta . <P> Confident that they had something important , Republicans in the MacArthur investigating committee last week urged Chairman Richard Russell to get the original . Russell asked for it , but by week 's end the Army had not found it .
