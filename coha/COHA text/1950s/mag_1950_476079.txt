you ask me how I write a novel . But I do not in fact write one novel at a time . The process is more like collecting . I begin , that is , not with an idea for a book , but with a character in a situation . Then , if both seem to me useful and significant , I write a few pages to show that character in that situation . Of course , every character in every situation is significant to some degree , because all of them are part of the one real world in action ; but there is n't time to deal with all of them . To take an example , every family shows the everlasting situation of authority and freedom ; or , as I see it , of older people who have grown attached to a certain kind of existence because they have made it , and younger people who , in their turn , are anxious to make a new existence for themselves . This situation produces a great variety of tension , comic or tragic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore insignificant . Or , if you like , it signifies only muddle . A writer for whom muddle is the chief characteristic of life would no doubt be interested therefore in a man or woman for whom the muddle of his family relations was incurable , who was defeated by it , or grew resigned to it , or escaped from it into some bolt hole of juju . But muddle does n't interest me except as a necessary accident of life , like the weather . It is part of a background , and so I should notbe concerned with a situation of muddle , or a character who illustrated it . But a character like Rose in my novel The Moonlight fascinated me , because she tried with all her soul to make order in the world , to make her sisters live what seemed to her good , dignified , worthy , and happy lives . With one sister she succeeded ; with the other she failed . And her success and failure were due to the nature of the world , of a reality shot through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Rose in my mind and in various notebooks for years before the book was written , or rather I had about six different Roses . Because every woman , more or less , is tackling Rose 's problem , and it takes thousands of different forms . I had notes , years old , not only of Rose 's character , that of the responsible parent , teacher , ruler ; but of the younger sisters , the taught , the governed , struggling not so much for liberty as for freedom to make their own lives , for power of every kind , knowledge , jobs , money , a place in the world . Sometimes this description of a character and a situation grows into a book . It gathers to itself other characters and incidents , until one day I realize that it is at least the matter of a book . But The Moonlight did not arise in that manner . It started in a violent reaction against Tolstoy 's Kreutzer Sonata . I thought that great novel not merely unfair to women , but stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had to create their lives . I made notes then for a parallel book in which a woman just out of jail tells the story of a murder , exactly as Tolstoy 's hero in The Kreutzer Sonata tells how he has murdered his wife from sexual jealousy . I wrote a good deal of this story , perhaps fifty thousand words , and then for some reason abandoned it . Three years later , I came across the other notes on Rose and her sisters , and the two separate conceptions ran together and interested me so much that I set about to write The Moonlight . But this new book was quite different from the old . In the old , the narrator was the equivalent of Ella , one of Rose 's sisters . I did not dare even to read the old manuscript , which is still in the attic , in case it should overwhelm the new scheme . I knew that it had a power which might well draw me back to it and away from my new conception ? so that neither would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I knew , was to give a larger background , to show the woman 's special dilemma in different generations , the means by which , in different social periods , it might be solved . And I wanted also to show the relation between these devised expedients , or moralities ? what is often called the convention of a time ? and the fundamental quality of a woman 's life , imposed upon her by her sex , her natural powers , and her natural place in a society which contains , like herself , both primary elements from nature and a secondary social and political form . Thus The Moonlight exists in two different states , with different characters and , as far as I can remember , different incidents . And whether the one that was published is the better , I can not tell . I HAVE a great number of similar manuscripts in every stage of development . Some of them are almost complete books , abandoned because I was dissatisfied with them . Two or three are complete , but I do n't publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others consist of only a few pages , often cut out of a finished book . I cut the best chapter out of The Horse 's Mouth , and someday I shall enlarge it and finish it . I cut fifty thousand words out of A Fearful Joy , a novel I have just completed , because , though they belonged to the theme , they developed it at an angle from the main line , and brought in new characters when I had already as many as I could deal with . Thus a finished book of mine starts usually perhaps ten years before as a charaater sketch and a bit of description ; it goes on to an incident or so , it gathers subsidiary characters , and then perhaps I grow interested in it , and set out to give it form as a book . I sketch a plan ; I may write the end , the middle , and the beginning , and very often in this order . That is , I decide how and where the book shall end , which is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I ask myself where are the most difficult turns in the book . Then I may write one of these difficult passages to see if it is viable . And if , as often happens , it does not work , I may stop there . But if it does work , then I may devise a beginning and finish the book . But the chief problem still remains , which is to decide what I shall express in the book . AIL my books suffer large cuts , even in the last draft . This is largely because they are all statements about a single reality , in which every part is related to every other part . r is impossible to show this whole in one book . James Joyce has tried in Finnegans Wake to give his notion of reality in depth ; for that purpose , he devised a special language , and still he had to leave out nine-tenths of what is significant even by his own scheme . The very fact that it takes time to read limits the field of a novelist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be invoked in succession , and therefore become ineffective or false . Joyce 's attempt to pack the effect of three or four different symbols into one word often has a brilliant success but , if it should fail , fails disastrously ; I mean , it breaks the spell for the reader and jolts him out of pure experience into bewilderment or anxious inquiry . And it is my first rule that the reader must not be confused , must not be jolted . I 'm told that I have a style , but I am not aware of it . I try only to be clear , to avoid , especially , proyoking in the reader ideas which have nothing to do with the theme ; above all , to keep out of sight . An author has no more business in a book than the microphone on the screen . It is hard enough for him to give a clear coherent impression without unnecessary distractions . There are two versions of The Moonlight , because I wanted to give a larger picture , but I suspect that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My gains were paid for . To Be A Pilgrim , for instance , deals with a man of strong religious and affectionate character , suffering the moral changes of seventy years , the inevitable and continuous revolution which goes on all the time , everywhere . I had to show , therefore -- I had to make the reader feel ? the fundamental power and drive of the Protestant tradition which is the soul of British and American democracy ; to get , if possible , at the roots of that religious intuition . That involved also the political aspects of the - Protestant tradition . It could involve and , in actual life , would involve the aesthetic ideas evolving in the same period . But it was impossible to deal with them because they would have made the book not only too long , but too complex . For a book , like every other form of art , is the communication of an experience . That experience must have form in order to be coherent , in order to be an experience , and not merely a confused succession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain definite consequence , a meaning . The great problem before a writer is to convey , in one work of art , one formal conception , a significance which is simple enough for immediate apprehension by the feelings of a reader , and yet not false to the immense complication of actual life . Reality is one whole . Religion is full of aesthetic feeling and political action ; politics uses aesthetic and religious appeal ; every man is born into a society which is at once constant in its primitive natural elements , the natural family relationships , the needs , passions , and ambitions of all human nature ; and highly flexible in its larger groupings of tribal , national , and moral organization . The relations of the simplest character , the implications of the most elementary story , are as wide as you like to make them , and the difficulty is to know where to place your limits . T HE second great problem of form is in the construction . When you have cut out your subject and decided its limitations , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its different sphere and its own limitations . Music has a far more powerful and immediate effect on the feelings , but not so precise a one as the poem or the novel . For the poem or novel has significance not only for the feelings , but for the judgment . I write judgment because , of course , all arts appeal to the mind as well as the feelings . You can not separate mind from feeling . All thoughts have value ; all feelings move the mind . The form of a symphony provokes delight in the mind as well as the feelings ; it is not merely a collection of noises hitting directly upon the sense ; it is an intellectual structure exciting to the mind . It is a complex of sensuous and mental feeling which is called beauty when excited by a symphony , a picture , a piece of sculpture ; and in a novel , sometimes significance , sometimes unity , sometimes greatness . These different adjectives probably express a different mental attitude . The mind delights in the structure , the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or reason . It does not say , " This is true , " but , " That is right , that is well done . " The reader of a book therefore is continually using his judgment ; and novels appeal to what might be called conceptual feeling . To do this they create what is called an illusion of life itself ; characters , who , it is said , seem to live in a real world . This is not strictly true . Hans Andersen and Walt Disney do not trouble to give an illusion of life , but they are highly effective artists . They convey both feeling and mean , ing with great force . And all great literary art partakes of the fable . But it is true to say that in the pure . fable , like " Jack and the Beanstalk " or " Puss in Boots , " the appeal is to the simplest , most rudimentary judgments of feeling . And that in such a book as Tolstoy 's Resurrection , which is a religious fable in the sense that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moral , the fabulous element is skilfully dissembled . Tolstoy uses every device to make us feel that the characters are real people in a true story . And we do so ; we are moved as by the adventures and sufferings of real people we meet every day . Tolstoy , having to give a moral lesson , knows it is useless to say , " This or that is wicked " ; he must make his readers feel the wickedness , and he does it by playing upon their natural human sympathies for others . Many people do not like the Resurrection because its moral purpose is too obvious . It does not move them because they see Tolstoy at work trying to instruct them . And the result is not only resentment against the instruction , but a failure to be moved by the book . For it becomes a piece of propaganda , a marionette show . Such readers would prefer , very likely , the newspaper reports of some tragic affair to which they can provide their own judgments . And they draw the conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message ; he should write yarns and leave instruction to the professors . But the real situation , I think , is not so simple . Art can and must be used for any kind of communication , including instruction . Tolstoy 's fable of the three old men who walked on the sea moves us powerfully even though we do n't agree with its religious object . It is great art . It is a powerful and meaningful experience . An experience which makes us realize for ourselves the religious climate of another soul , however different from ours , is one of the most valuable we have . Thus the failure of Resurrection , if it is a failure , is due not to its carrying a message , but to bad art . It fails to communicate an experience . To me , Resurrection is successful , but I agree that Tolstoy only just succeeds in saving his work . And few other writers could have succeeded in his place . For the moment a writer begins obviously to instruct , he ceases to move . His characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventriloquists ' dummies speaking with his voice from a stage . Yet a book must have a meaning for the judgment ; it must add up ; it must have unity within itself . T HE problem of construction , then , is to design a book in which all the characters and incidents form parts of one coherent experience for the judgment , and at the same time to give it the vitality of a narrative from actual life ? which in itself , of course , has no meaning , or such a confusion of meanings that it adds up to nonsense . And this is really the most difficult and troublesome part of the work because there is no end to it . When a critic wrote lately that I had no form , but plenty of life , in a book which had been under construction for several years , I was highly complimented . I would much rather be accused of wanting form ? that is , meaning ? than life ; I suppose because I am so strongly aware of my own meaning . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained that I was too objective gave me pleasure . For I had tried to be objective ; and this is not always very easy when one is entirely convinced that the world is such and such a kind of reality , and not at all what some character believes it to be . One is always in danger of thinking , " But if I allow such things to be said , and to happen , the reader will suppose that they are true , that they ought to happen , and so make nonsense of the book . " The unity of a book , so much talked about by the critics , is a unity of experience , of impression . And this , of course , is much easier to attain in a book which aims at one simple and limited impression . Flaubert 's Simple Heart has the most exact and powerful effect ; it achieves precisely what it sets out to do . But it is very short , and its purpose was very simple and also easy . Sympathy for a peasant girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Flaubert 's Buvard and Pecuchet was such a failure that Flaubert himself could not finish it . It has form , or meaning , but not only is the meaning feeble , it is expressed in endless repetition . We see Flaubert manipulating his puppets throughout , and simply to express a contempt for the petty bourgeois , a contempt both ungenerous and ill-founded . Contempt for any class , race , people , as a whole , is stupid and the mark of a mind either stupid or rancorous . The smallest experience of life shows that individuals within any one class or race differ far more than classes or races as a whole . One duke may differ far more from another than from his butler . An Indian engineer has much more in common with an English engineer than with one of his own professors of archeology who would be happy all day with his opposite number from the U. S. A. Buvard and Pecuchet has a mass of good detail , but its unity is that of a rubbish chute . But take a masterpiece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the admiration of all novelists . It is , however , a dangerous example , for it is very close to the edge of that same constructive error which ruined Buvard and Pecuchet . It is organized to the last degree ; it is highly artificial , and the artifices are not concealed . Examine the chapter where Rudolphe makes love to Madame Bovary during the prize-giving at the agricultural show . And many misguided writers have copied just this artificiality of form , this superficial pattern . Whereas , what saves Madame Bovary is not the artifice , but something that apparently Flaubert did not mean to put into the book at all , his romantic sympathy for the heroine . This colors and unifies the whole work ; it justifies all the tricks because they are necessary to that unity of impression . But they are not by any means the only way , or perhaps the best way , of giving that unity . Consider Dreiser 's American Tragedy , also a great book , but one that avoids so carefully the least appearance of artifice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dreiser is so anxious to make the reader receive the story as true that he pretends to have no art at all , not even grammar . And this itself is high art . It succeeds , it convinces . It gives the book something of the impressive dignity of nature . If Madame Bovary is like a monument , An American Tragedy is like a mountain . ? I am not going to say that I prefer mountains to monuments ; I need both , but , as a writer , I am much more afraid of producing the stony mass than the hilly wilderness . The prettiest compliment I have had was from a distinguished English critic who said I improvised . This was of The Horse 's Mouth , which had been five or six years in gestation and rewritten several times over . But much of that rewriting was intended to hide the construction , to make each part seem to arise out of the narrative . III T HE world loves its own creation , which is its life . Not merely the artist , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself a world to which , as creator , he is deeply attached . Eachof these worlds is highly complex and extensive . One man , for instance , does not create for himself only a home , a business , a family , but a religion , a political idea , a nation , a world idea . He creates them in his imagination , and lives in them . Deprived of them , Or even of any large part of them , he would wither and die . I do n't know any misery like that of the artist whose work has gone out of fashion . I vividly remember such a man when I was young ; his despair , his bewilderment . He had been praised by the critics , admired , he had sold his pictures and enjoyed distinction . Now in his sixties he was not only laughed at , he was despised . And his family was starving . That man suffered more than other old gentlemen whose ideas had become contemptible to a new generation , eager to create its own world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could not conceive of any " good " art except his own academic kind , he was like one of those moralists who nowadays are quite sure that the world is going to the devil on account of easier divorce , or artificial insemination , or women 's votes , or drink , or the so-called immorality of the stage and the writers . He had read or at least assimilated no history , and his religion was a reach-me-down ; his God was an old gentleman in a fuss . But his tragedy was real ; it was the tragedy also of Wilcher in To Be A Pilgrim , regarded from the different angles of family life and moral change . Wilcher is a different man ; he has a different response , he did not suffer so hopelessly because he was wiser . As for Sara in Herself Surprised , she escaped , at least in the book , from any acute misery , simply by the power of her woman 's imagination . Give her for material almost any man and any sort of domicile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great adventurers in their own lives . A young woman , carefully brought up in some strict school and affectionate , guarded home , having got her man , will cheerfully set out to the other end of the world in order to do her job , which is not by any means in subordination . It is constructive , creative . She builds a society , a relationship , a spiritual world . And for that she must contrive some kind of working partnership with the man . He is at once her necessary partner and her first problem . Her success , like all success , is forever balanced on the edge of disaster . Sara was infinitely cunning in the management of her men , and the only man she loved broke her nose and deserted her . He did not want to be looked after . Yet the everlasting enterprise which was her undoing was also her salvation . She was still making a world for herself , a home , a family , when she was cut off . As for the moral and aesthetic revolutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during her whole life , she was scarcely aware of them . Her morals were the elementary morals of a primitive woman , of nature herself , which do not change ; and she was supremely indifferent to politics , religion , economics . She was a female artist who was always composing the same work in the same style , but it is a style which does not go out of fashion . But all that had to be left out of the book when I chose to write it in the first person . In order to get the life of the character , Sara herself , I chose a means of presentation which , because that character was simple and had to be simple , active , unreflective , could not show the character in depth , as aware of itself , or its significance in the world . To do that I should have had to write the book in the third person , with a complex plot ; to do , in fact , what I did in the second and published version of The Moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said as no other version of Sara was written , and it does not exist for comparison . That , in fact , is the kind of question which drives writers into an early grave ? the technical problem . Every single method has its own advantages and its own limitations . The first person has great narrative force , but is exceedingly limited in scope and content . The third , in its classic form , is immensely flexible and revealing , but by the very fact that it allows a writer to be everywhere , to see everything , it loses conviction and force . vI ACH technique has a further disadvan- tage , known only to professionals . The first person imposes not only limitations of character , place , and time , but of event . Everything that does not happen to the narrator must be related by him and is therefore further removed from actuality than a story told in the third person . For that storyis related by a real person , the author , and this one is told by a fictitious person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a narrative in which the hero 's adventures make up the tale . In the third person , on the other hand , since there are no limits of time , place , and character , it is so easy to invent incidents and people that the problem is one of selection . This is a real problem for any writer who aims at significance . A third method , of course , is to combine the two , like Conrad with his Marlowe , to have the story told in the first person by a fictitious character . This way seems to have all the faults and none of the merits of the other two techniques . It has only one advantage : it enables the writer to describe the narrator . I have never yet used this device , but I am not going to forswear it . I may some day pull one of my dossiers out of a drawer , some bundle of character , incident , and suggestion , which has been waiting for the technical method which will give it expression , and discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . A s FOR what laymen call plots , they grow on trees . Anyone can write a plot ; the oldest are probably the best . A plot is the last thing I think about , and it is never fixed until the story is finished . I may make fundamental changes of plot in my last draft . The right and significant form of any work of art is not in any plot , but in a final character of being . This is true of a building , a piece of sculpture , a picture , and a frock , as well as a book . Frocks lead us into aesthetic metaphysics ; we have no time just now to ask why one frock is admired and another detested ; why even in a sphere considered so irresponsible and fantastic as that of women 's fashions , some are forever called beautiful , and others forever found ridiculous . But it can be seen that in the most beautiful forms of dress , however different ? the Moorish , the Indian , the different peasant costumes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crinolines , even the bustles ? each has some relation to a woman 's nature , not only her physical nature but , by implication , the whole range of her special activity , her special powers as a woman . Thus the art of dress and its unities , its rules , arise from the nature of things . So , too , do those of sculpture , and , in still more complex relations , of architecture ? a truth dimly apprehended and crudely expressed by the cant about machines for living . The form of a book therefore is not in some artificial pattern , some formula , but in its relation to ultimate truth . I say this because so many people think they can buy the art of writing from some correspondence school . An artist does not start with literature , but life , and the deeper he can go into life , the better . He would also be well advised to suspect any ready-made answers , whether political , religious , or psychological . Where are the Freudians of yesteryear ? Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a little bit of truth wrapped up in a mass of nonsense . What you want to do is to dig out the truth , or as much of it as you can pry loose . The fact is that the process of education after one leaves college is complex and obscure . You read , you talk , you meditate ; and writing a book is always an exploration as well as a setting forth . It is an adventure in which you survey a new part of your world . Above all , keep away from the easy analogy , from the kind of criticism which praises Benjamin Constant 's Adolphe as the most " perfect of novels because of its sculpturesque simplicity of form . " This notion involves two profound fallacies . One is that sculpture has a special beauty because of its limitation and compactness ; whereas its beauty , like the beauty of all art , is in the emotional response of those who apprehend it , and this may be very complex . The other is that Adolphe is a great novel because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; whereas its form is good not because it is limited , but because it is adequate . It is the right method for its author 's purpose . Tolstoy 's War and Peace is far from simple . It is vast and complex , with scores of characters . It brings in every kind of discussion , every kind of problem , that can trouble humanity . Yet it is not a slice of life ; it is not a mere yarn , a collection of events . It has the unity of a great work of art , presenting life not as a confusion of nonsensical accidents , but as a scene of moral struggle , moral achievement , in a world of evil and folly . Thus the everlasting conflict between what is called the French school on the one hand , and the English and Russian schools on the other , is stupid . There is only one good school : that of writers who find the right form for their material , for their purpose as artists .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
