For months , publishing circles have buzzed with the rumor that the New York Journal-American ( circ. 599,536 ) , biggest afternoon paper in the Hearst chain , was selling out to Scripps-Howard 's afternoon New York World-Telegram and Sun ( circ. 450,486 ) . The rumor gained currency in the light of two major Hearst and Scripps-Howard mergers : last year 's merger of Hearst 's money-losing International News Service with Scripps-Howard 's United Press , and last summer 's union of Hearst 's unprofitable San Francisco evening paper , the Call-Bulletin , with Scripps-Howard 's equally unprofitable News . <P> Patiently , but with mounting irritation , Hearst executives denied the rumor every time it popped up , finally exploded last week when the American Newspaper Guild , recirculating the rumor , all but buried the Journal-American . In an article in the Guild Reporter , the Guild 's International Executive Board asked U.S. Department of Justice trustbusters to investigate " with zeal a reported arrangement between Hearst and Scripps-Howard news , paper chains to carve up their markets . " Continued the Guildsmen : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . may soon be deprived of their favorite newspaper , despite denials . The Hearst Journal-American thus would give its 1,500 faithful employees of long service Christmas presents in the form of dismissal notices . " <P> Moving swiftly , Journal-American Publisher Joseph Kingsbury Smith had a $3,100,000 libel suit filed against the Guild . " Deliberate malice or shocking irresponsibility , " said Smith of the article . " It is idiotic to think that the management of the Journal-American would be planning to suspend publication .
