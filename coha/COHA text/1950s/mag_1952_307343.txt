In the comic-strip world of Li'l Abner the unthinkable is always happening . But few readers ever expected the most unthinkable event of all : the ( " gulp " ) marriage of Li'l Abner to Daisy Mae . Though Abner has been close enough to the altar to whiff the smoke from the cigar of self-made Magistrate Marryin ' Sam , Cartoonist Al Capp always stepped in , in time 's nick , with a save . Once , at the crucial moment , a gas explosion blasted Abner into a tree out of Daisy Mae 's reach . Another time , after Preacher Sam had completed the $1.25 ceremony ( with " hootin ' an ' hollerin ' , catch-as-catch-can rasslin ' . . . and several embarrassin ' jokes told in a loud voice as yo ' departs on yore honeymoon " ) , Li'l Abner was reprieved ; his marriage license had expired . But this week the most unthinkable is happening . Man of Honor . As all Al Capp 's " slobbering fans " know , Abner is a man of honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detective Fearless Fosdick ( Capp 's take-off on Dick Tracy ) , he swore to follow Fosdick 's example in every way . Fosdick soon posed a terrible problem to Abner . During an economy drive on the police force , Fosdick was told by his chief that unless he married , he would be axed along with all the other bachelors . Since a " scientific aptitude test " proved Detective Fosdick too stupid for any other job , he grudgingly married his hatchet-faced girl friend Prudence ( " ugh ! " ) Pimpleton. * Abner , true to his pledge , had to follow suit . However , he was so confident a miracle would save him that he did not even bother to get out of bed on the morning when Daisy Mae breathlessly held him to his promise ( see cut ) . But this time , no matter what happens to Fosdick , Abner will stay married . <P> A Wholesome Note . After 18 years , Capp has finally bowed to true love because he has become worried over the heavy load of satire his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " un-American , " and he thinks a marriage , even a $1.35 ( new inflation price ) Dogpatch one , will introduce a wholesome note . Says Capp : " When I kidded advertising , people wrote , ' Do n't you know advertising is the backbone of America ? ' This attitude made me uneasy about kidding America . . . The only thing for me to do seemed to be to change completely , hoping that in another year the air would clear . " Actually , Capp also has a more practical reason : the marriage opens up a new wealth of material . Asks Capp : " Now how will Abner , who has never worked , support Daisy Mae ? Will they have a family ? Who will boss the household ? " <P> By the time Li'l Abner fans have recovered from the shock of the marriage , Capp will have another surprise for them . Next fall , he plans to make Fearless Fosdick a separate comic strip and has already lined up papers in 30 cities . <P> * The face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Fosdick 's bride first turned up in the strip several years ago her name was Bess Backache.
