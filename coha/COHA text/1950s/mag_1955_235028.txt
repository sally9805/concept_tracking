Even at 61 , the broken-nosed , greying little battler was more than a match for most men . It took two husky hospital attendants to handle him when they decided to get him under control . He got a chestful of broken ribs during the mauling , but he recovered quickly enough . He was used to beatings . It was a long series of beatings that had put Adolph ( " Ad " ) Wolgast into the psychopathic ward of California 's Stockton State Hospital in the first place . For eleven years the " Michigan Wildcat " had held his own in the savage battles of the pre-World War I prize ring . He had slugged and butted and cuffed his way to the lightweight championship of the world , and he had his brains unhinged in the process . A small-town scrapper from Cadillac , Mich. , Ad Wolgast took the title from Battling Nelson in 1910 . Their 40-round brawl at Point Richmond , just across the bay from San Francisco , was one of the bloodiest in the history of boxing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fighters , and when Referee Eddie Smith called them to the center of the ring to explain the rules , Nelson cut him short : " Let everything go . No fouls . " That was all right with Ad . It was a fight to the finish . In the 23rd round Nelson , the " Durable Dane , " dropped the challenger with a liver punch . Somehow , Ad got up and fought on . In the 40th round Eddie stopped the fight . Nelson was a helpless hulk , his face a mess of bleeding flesh . But the winner had taken more of a licking than anyone realized . In two short years Ad Wolgast fought 21 times , finally lost his title to Willie Ritchie in another vicious slugfest . From then on he was lost in a punch-drunk dream of a comeback . He continued to train , and he continued to fight . He frittered away the fortune that he had won with his fists . In 1917 a Milwaukee court declared him legally incompetent . For a few years Wolgast had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Doyle . He had the run of Doyle 's gym , worked out regularly , and still thought of himself as the champ . Such admiring oldtimers as Jim Jeffries , Tom Sharkey and Tommy Ryan dropped by to assure him that he still had his knockout punch . He demanded all the prerogatives of a titleholder , and was likely to swing on the first man who did not recognize his rank ( but Doyle had issued orders that no one was ever to lay a hand on Ad ) . Even after he was committed to an asylum in 1927 , Ad kept right on training , weaving , ducking and swishing uppercuts as he shadowboxed with the phantoms from his past . Once in a while , he came out of the fog . " Say , what is this place ? " he would ask . " When do I get out of here ? " In the last few years he went blind . The questions came less frequently , and the battered brain gave up groping toward the present . Last week , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally stopped fighting .
