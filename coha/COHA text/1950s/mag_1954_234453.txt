" Why all the fuss ? " asked France 's Georges Bidault wearily , as he entrained from Geneva to face a hostile assembly in Paris . " When the game is over , why not merely say so ? " <P> The man who blew the whistle was Russia 's Molotov . Ever since he returned from Moscow ten days before , he had dropped his role of forbearing arbiter and become once again the familiar aggressive antagonist . Observers suspected that he had learned in Moscow the only thing he wanted to know : the U.S. was not going to intervene in Indo-China . Last week Molotov got confirmation from the highest sources . Secretary of State Dulles said that the U.S. " has no intention of dealing with the Indo-China situation unilaterally " ; that it was up to the French , and that there were no plans for asking Congress to act . President Eisenhower , who had once called Indo-China the cork in the bottle , said that without the proper psychological and political foundation , there was no sense in merely using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. intentions had been the only deterrent to Communist Hemands , it was a deterrent no longer . <P> In a plenary session called at his request , Molotov bided his time while Bi dault argued , with an eye on Paris , that the conference had achieved " some appreciable results , " notably its acceptance of the French plea to discuss a military cease-fire before going into the interminable difficulties of a political settlement . Then Molotov spoke . <P> He was abusive , arrogant , mocking . Clearly intending to bring down the La-niel government , he complained of Bi-dault 's " refusal or evasion of negotiations " with the Viet Minh itself , taunted him with the cost to France in men and money of a " colonial war . " He charged that the Bao Dai government had no popular support . He claimed that the Communists already controlled three-quarters of Viet Nam , half of Laos , a smaller but increasing part of Cambodia . As for Dienbienphu , " Who can deny that the defense of Dienbienphu was in the main carried out not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foreigners gathered there ? " <P> Then Molotov deliberately demolished all Bidault 's hopes for a quick ceasefire . The conference must " examine without further delay the political questions , " said Molotov blandly . These should include , " first of all , " the " granting of sovereignty " to all three Indo-Chinese states , the holding of " free elections " in each , and the withdrawal of all " foreign " troops . Political discussion , he said , should be parallel with the military , and should be conducted by " direct contact between the representatives of both sides " - an arrangement that would force recognition of the bogus and largely nonexistent " liberation " movements of both Laos and Cambodia .
