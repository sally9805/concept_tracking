Author Robert Cedric Sherriff ( Journey 's End ) had a modest proposal for the British Treasury . Sherriff , whose new play , Home at Seven , was netting him 3,600 a year , had just had an offer of 10,000 ( $28,000 ) to write a script for <P> Hollywood . Sherriff sat down , did some quick calculating , figured that Socialist Britain 's income tax would take all but 500 . Said he : " It did n't seem worth while putting in four or five months of very hard work for a sum I could make as a jobbing gardener-or collecting refuse in cans , for that matter . " <P> Two weeks ago Sherriff approached the Treasury , offered to write the Hollywood script for a nominal 100 , provided that the remaining 9,900 went to the Society of Antiquaries for the excavation of some Roman ruins in Norfolk . Said Sherriff : " It is neither comforting nor does it make one proud to reflect that one is providing so many free sets of false teeth ... to the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it would produce something for the nation I could feel I had a hand in . " <P> Last week Sherriff 's proposal was answered . Treasury officials were sympathetic but firm : there was no legislation to cover such an arrangement . That decided Sherriff : the $28,000 would go unearned , the Roman ruins Would go unexcavated , and Sherriff himself would continue to work only four months of the year and to work his farm the other eight . Said Sherriff : " I think I 'll find looking after the chickens more profitable and more interesting . "
