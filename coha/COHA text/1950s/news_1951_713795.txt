txt General of the Army Douglas 's Constellation plane Bataan landed at National Airport at 12:32 A. AL after a flight of eight hours and six minutes from San Francisco . A moment later the General , tight-lipped and unsmiling , received an almost hysterical welcome from a crowd that swarmed about the huge four-motored plane . General is here to make a major speech before a joint meeting of the Senate and House of Representatives today . Among the first to greet the returned hero of the Pacific was General of the Army George C. Marshall , Secretary of Defense . The two clasped hands and General said , ' Hello , George . How are you ? " Vaughan Among Greeters General also exchanged hasty greetings with Maj. Gen. Harry " H.

Wheery , Republican of Nebraska , and Representative Joseph Martin , 1Republican of Massachusetts . Genleral shouted a greeting to Mr. Martin , " How do you do , // Mr , Speaker ? " Mr. Martin is a former ' Speaker of the House of Representatives . At this . point several hundred persons who had been among the thousands held back from the official , greeting party by restraining ropes broke through and caused general confusion . *They swarmed all about the plane , sweeping aside dignitaries and . newsmen and making it extremely difficult - for General and his party to make their way fifty feet to the car that soon took them to the Statler Hotel , where the general ! was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , evidently under strict orders to be polite to everyone at all costs , were unable to control those who got out of hand . . With the general as he left for the hotel was Mrs. . She had stepped from the plane a few seconds before her husband on the arm of an Air Force officer . She seemed extremely fatigued and leaned on her escort heavily . The general 's 13-year-old son , . Arthur , got off the plane some time later and in the confusion went unnoticed by newsmen and the crowd alike . Throughout the arrival the crowd at the , airport screamed its approval. , Especially noticeable were the shrill cries of women . Squeezing his way behind the official party was Representative Martin , hatless and disheveled . " How do you like this welcome you brought on ? " he was asked . It was Mr. Martin who precipitated General 's dismissal by the publication of a letter from the general . " Magnificent , " shouted Mr. Martin . " I was lucky to get out alive .

A5 crowds surged forward the soldiers ' ranks were broken and they were pushed and shoved about while helplessly trying to stand at attention . .. Although General was on the airstrip for about fifteen minutes he was able to spend only about- two of these greeting old friends . The rest of the time he endeavored to make his way through the pressing mob . Family Separated In the general confusion the members of the family were separated and had all they could do to . keep ' their feet . Maj. Gen. Courtney S. Whitney , the general 's closest adviser , was not so fortunate . He toppled to the ground in the press of the mob , . Adding- to the confusion on the field , brightly lit for the occasion , were 300 reporters , and photographers for the press and newsreels **30;244;TOOLONG : A dozen or more of the photographers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaving the airport .

The offibial car was driven to a ramp back of the hotel and the general and his party ascended a stairway to the second floor , where they boarded a private elevator that took them to the Presidential Suite . Inside the hotel spectators , many in evening dress , had waited since 11 P. M. hoping to get a look at the family . All they got , however , was the briefest glimpse . as the party left the car and crossed the ramp to the stairway . Police lines at the hotel kept the ? crowd orderly . Even photographers and reporters failed to obtain permission to get near the unloading ramp . " Those reporters who did get near enough the general to ask questions were told crisply , " No statement now " or " Nothing tonight .
