While Soviet scientists cheered their Lunik back toward earth , U.S. space and missile men also put in a busy week . In a three-point hat trick after weeks of disappointing failures , the U.S. orbited an instrument-packed scientific satellite , quickly topped off that accomplishment with the most successful flights yet of an air-launched ballistic missile and a Nike-Zeus anti-missile missile . Items : Up from the launch pad at Cape Canaveral and into orbit from the tip of a four-stage Army Juno II rocket curved the 91-lb . Explorer VII . By far the most sophisticated U.S. satellite , it is crammed with instruments that will chemically identify and count heavy particles of cosmic rays ( knowledge that is crucial to manned space flight ) , study the transfer of heat from tropics to polar regions and from the earth back into space ( which is basic to weather forecasting ) , and carry out other experiments . The satellite is shaped like a gyroscope and is spun to keep it whirling cleanly instead of tumbling . It squeals like a bagpipe as it signals from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar-powered and possibly could transmit for the expected life of the satellite-20 years . But , through a unique timing device , the radio will shut off after one year so as not to clutter the air waves . Explorer VII takes over from the Explorer VI paddlewheel ( TIME , Aug. 17 ) , whose solar-powered radio , expected to run for years , disappointingly signed off a fortnight ago . <P> Within hours of the Explorer VII firing , and not far away , a B-47 bomber rose seven miles above the Atlantic . It hovered off the Florida coast until the orbiting Explorer VI was passing overhead ; then the three-man crew launched a two-stage , solid-fuel Bold Orion missile . <P> <P> The 37-ft . Martin-made missile lifted into a steep arc , soared " within ten miles " of Explorer VI , 156 miles up . It then continued squarely on course , plunking into the ocean 1,000 miles from the launch spot . The Air Force 's argument : an airborne ballistic missile like Bold Orion , mounted on a long-endurance B70 bomber , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be difficult to pinpoint and knock out ; it might also be used against enemy satellites or spaceships . Next day an Army solid-fuel Nike-Zeus anti-missile missile streaked across the skies above White Sands Proving Ground , N. Mex . Among the nation 's warbirds , it is the most powerful ( up to 500,000 lbs . thrust v. 400,000 Ibs. for the Atlas ) and the fastest ( more than 17,000 m.p.h . ) . At those speeds the Zeus encounters enormous heat and stress , and it broke up on its maiden flight in August . Last week 's Zeus fell a bit short of its planned 100-mile course , but showed that the frame and propulsion system are basically solid .
