txt . WASHINGTON , Feb. ** until Congress has decided whether to submit to the states an amendment to the Constitittinh on the making of treaties and - Executive agreements , and Ale text if submitted is in final form , can the effects on the public interest of the current controversy begin to be soundly appraised But in the present stage of the debate these assets and liabilities of the movement initiated by Senator John W.:Bricker of Ohio and an American Bar Association group - can- .be listed as reasonable speculations : Asset No. ** debate , in which learned lawyers are arrayed against one another with a series of flat contradictions of fact and interpretation bewildering to the lay public , has aroused a new and healthy interest among the people in the Iiistork of the Constitution , the laws founded upon it and the na , ture aif ' the ' conduct of foreign policy-by the United States . Debate Worthy of Issue Asset 2 ? Though the debate . in ' the Senate and outside it thus ' fat has necessarily been weighted down with legal technicalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these etanhet be comprehensively summarized . in newspapers , however ' - large , it has become worthy of , the issue . In The Congressional , Record , dated Feb. 4 there is a verbatim transcript of such a Senate discussion . Those who have the time and will take the trouble to read this transcript will understand why judicialrhistory lends ' support to the movement led by Senator . Bricker . . ? Chief among these decisions is the Pink case in which the Court equated with a treaty an Executive agreement between President F. D. Roosevelt and Commissar Litvinoff , and held that this overretie-a New York State law and was not barred by the Fifth Amendment , which forbids private property to be taken by government without due process of law : In another , the Capps case , the Attorney General seeks to reverse a decision in a Federal Circuit Court that an Executive agreement may not repeal internal law and void an Act of Congress through the implied powers of the Presidential office . The third decision , of course , was in Missouri v. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court Justices agreed that a treaty with Great Britain gave Congress the right to enact legislation in an area reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment that it had no right to enact in the absence of the treaty . Closer Scrutiny of Treaties Asset 3 ? The revelations of the debate already have brought persuasion to many members of Congress and private citizens that some checks are needed to prevent the internal effects of treaties and Executive agreements from being automatically self-executing . Among those per ' , suaded differences exist , however . Pover whether these checks should be applied by an amendment to the Constitution . But the prevailin opinon is that , whatever their.form , the checks should not effect any restriction on the vast powers of the President as Commander in Chief . Also , the debate ' will influenes the President to be more watchful of the treaties he submits to the Senate and the Executive agreements he makes that involve internal law ; while the Senate will inspect treaties more closely for this factor . Liability No. ** President , to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign affairs , is dealing with the most delicate and dangerous international situation the United States has ever faced in peacetime . In this situation his world leadership and the prospects of its success are of fundamental importance to this nation and to those others aligned against Soviet aggression . The implication or likelihood that any of his essential powers to carry out his foreign programs are to be removed wreaks a certain degree of damage on his prestige and his influence abroad . 1 If associated governments should ' Conclude from the current controversy that the President is not in a position to assure redemption of pledges they find essential to that association and to their own security , this damage could be very great . Soviet Propaganda Busy Liability ** Soviet Government is alert to try to make effective propaganda against the United States out of any manifestation of deep internal dissension here over the role and authority of the three coordinate branches of this Government . Like all Soviet propaganda , the purpose of this is to weaken the confidence of our Allies in the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliance . When it can be represented by the Russians , as in this instance it can be , that the aim of the proposed restraints on the Executive is to increase the power of Congress and the several State Governments , they have a tool well fitted to their purpose . That is because the foreign estimate of Congress and the states is that they tend toward the return of some measure of what , for the want of a more accurate description , is called " isolationism . " And to those abroad isolationism means the abandonment of Europe and Asia to Soviet influence . Liability 3 ? President Eisenhower , because of his World War II and N. A. T. 0 . commands and because of the huge majority given him in the campaign of 1952 , is the incarnation to the world of American unity . That so many Senators of his own party support changes in the Constitution against which he has taken a last-ditch stand , and do this so soon after he led their party back into political power , is taken in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus has no symbol . So little are our constitutional and political systems understood abroad that the controversy over the Bricker and related proposals is not recognized for what it is historically  --  the pro - Congress . pro - states , lights movement which invaria- ! ' of follows the Administrations ' of Presidents who have subordinated the roles of Congress and ' the states to what they deemed la critical national interest that had to be served without delay . British Should Understand It is curious that even many British statesmen fail to make this evaluation , though their annals are full of the same reaction . But the reality of British unity was thoroughly demonstrated whenever a test came . And , ! whatever may be the outcome of the amending controversy in the United States , it is equally unlikely that the President will have been shorn of any basic authority his world leadership and his responsibility as Commander in Chief absolutely require . In the future , as in the past , the President as Commander in Chief will have the power , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ehgage the nation in wars that Congress has not formally declared .
