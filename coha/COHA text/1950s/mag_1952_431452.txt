Now in the golden season when the apples ripen and fall , I remember the gnarled and climb-inviting tree at the bottom of our garden ; I remember the warm . sweet - mell of the garret , where the fruit was stored , and the brilliantly heaped bowl that stood on the dining-room sideboard . The %ears pass ; the tree , the house , and the garret are far away ; hut still the orchards bud and blossom and let drop their bright harvest in the sun . Give me an apple : I want to take my childhood in my hand . The very first day of school , I set off down the road in a mixture of excitement and apprehension , carrying with me a new notebook , two pencils , and an apple . This last " in case you get hungry , " my mother said . But such a solid , reassuring object it was , encouraging to the eye , comfortably smooth against the palm , that I think it served to subdue my anxiety no less than my thirst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a long journey into a strange land , I know of no more companionable food to take along . Granted , it is plebeian enough ; but you may travel with luxurious grapes and strawberries . indeed with melons if it pleases you ? for myself , I want with me something firm and neat and pocket-size . I want an apple . I always had at least one every day ( the singsong formula about the doctor rings even now in my ears ) ; but on the rare occasions when the family went to a fair , I looked forward to a second and very special one . It would be waiting for me , I knew , in some gaily painted stall ; so I pushed my way through the jostling crowd , ignoring the brassy music of the carrousel , the shrill cries of the barkers , the stuffed animals and tinseled dolls that were shooting prizes , the tents , the swings , and the caravans , until I found what I was looking for . " Daddy ? please come ? toffee apples ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious . all-pervading stickiness of them ; the cloying crust ; and the sharp . clean fruit beneath ? And why is it , I wondered then as now . that anything eaten so , on a stick ? be it ice cream , spun  | sugar , apples , or lollipops ? becomes doubly delicious ? There were apples at Christmas , which had to be polished and threaded before they were hung on the tree , where they shone deep crimson in the candlelight . Others were piled high in the hall , in a bowl with ferns and walnuts , for visitors to take as they passed . And of course they were an indispensable part of Halloween . I remember ducking for the elusive fruit , which bobbed away just when you were sure you had it . I remember how we giggled , my cousins and I , and splashed , and how my long braids fell into the barrei and got soaked every year , until at last I grew too old for braids . But by then we had a new game . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the longest possible piece of peel . This you threw over your shoulder , and the initial it formed on the floor was that of the man you would someday marry . The event seemed remote , but the prophecy was nonetheless important . Small wonder that we were willing to invest apples with this magic power , for those we found in legend and literature were certainly far from ordinary . I think that apples and books have always been irrevocably entangled in my mind . Perhaps it is because the first sentence I read , in the first book I owned , ran as follows : " A IS FOR APPLE . " A nice , sensible statement ; an indisputable , unchangeable truth . One and one are two . A is for apple . Those words marked my entry into the matter-of-fact , grown-up world . But at the same time , since it was out of this book that I learned to read , they were the beginning of a great delight ; all the pleasure I have had from words ? of color and beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four . A is for apple . From this pictured apple in the alphabet book I passed on to others . I read about the golden apples of the Hesperides , guarded by a dragon that Hercules fought and slew . I read about the apple of discord , given by Paris to the most beautiful of the goddesses , which brought the wrath of the jealous down on Troy . I read of the apple with which the serpent tempted Eve ; the treacherous fruit that poisoned Snow White . I read of Johnny Appleseed , of William Tell . And I read in The Song of Songs the cry of the Shulamite : " Comfort me with apples : for I am sick of love . " And whether I am sick of love or ? which is fortunately the more usual occurrence ? merely a little blue , I can think of no better remedy : to take an apple in my hand , to savor the good fruit and the good memories together . Yes , comfort me . Comfort me with apples .  |   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
