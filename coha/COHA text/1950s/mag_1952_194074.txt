When the new TB drug , isoniazid , was first used ( TIME , March 3 ) , doctors noticed that some patients seemed to get a tremendous lift : they felt wonderful , out of all proportion to any real improvement in their lung condition . With some , this euphoria was so marked that it was a nuisance . But Dr. Albert E. Krieser saw no reason to expect the same sort of trouble when he began using Pyricidin ( a brand of isoniazid ) at Anoka State Hospital , Minn . His patients were both tuberculous and mental cases ; most of them had shown nothing resembling a spiritual lift in years . <P> After three weeks , Dr. Krieser found that some of the severe mental cases at Anoka were definitely behaving better . By now , Dr. Krieser reports , six patients have improved markedly , twelve moderately , and three slightly , for a total of 21 out of 48 cases treated . There is no relationship between the effect of the drug on a patient 's physical disease and on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental , while others show the reverse ; a few get better both ways . <P> Nobody knows how isoniazid affects the central nervous system to produce the lift . But Dr. Krieser and his colleagues want to make sure that isoniazid is , as they now believe , better than shock treatment .
