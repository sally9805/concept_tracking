" Mike did this spontaneous roll-out , " explained the short , intense young man , " and there was something nasty in the music . I just blurted out , ' You ai n't nuthin ' but a hound dog , ' and there it was . " Hound Dog , as bawled by Elvis Presley , sold 5,000,000 records , enthroned Tunesmiths Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller as kings of the state of annoyance called rock ' n ' roll . In all , their raucous inspirations have since sold 27 million records , and last week their latest , Charlie Brown , made its first million . <P> The youthful ( both are 25 ) writing pals are now living in Manhattan brownstones on incomes of about $75,000 a year ( cash ) , but to hear them tell it , they are laboring on a Jailhouse rock . " At least 60% of our stuff is rock ' n ' roll , " laments Leiber , " and we 're sick of it . But consumers dictate the market : kids nine to 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want . " In massive doses , this is just what the pair has been giving them : Love Me ( 2,000,000 copies sold ) , Loving You ( 2,000,000 ) , Searching ( 1,250,000 ) , Jailhouse Rock ( 2,000,000 ) , King Creole ( 1,000,000 ) . <P> Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller began their career as amateur songwriters at Los Angeles City College , earned less than $2,000 apiece their first two years . Then , in 1952 , they whelped Hound Dog in 20 minutes flat . " Originally , it was folk blues , " says Leiber . " When Presley , shall we say , performed it , there was a misunderstanding of the original lyrics-it was designed to be sung by a girl . " Adds Leiber : " The thing to remember is you 're not writing a song but a record . What you got ta do is get these kids to identify . That 's how we got Yakety Yak 1,000,000 . Mike was at the piano and I was making tea . He started an exciting riff , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers and the trash . ' At once Mike came up with the second line : ' You do n't get no spending cash . ' I felt right away we had a hit-we had a little slice here that had n't been touched . " <P> A slice the team would love to touch is Broadway , but Stoller ( who writes most of the music ) complains that " nobody has offered us a decent book . " In the meantime , Jerry and Mike go on helping the kids to identify . " Who 's always writin ' on the wall ? / Who 's always goofin ' in the hall ? / Who 's always throwin ' spitball ? " Why , Charlie Brown , of course . Says Leiber : " If Cole Porter were starting out today , he 'd have a tough time . "
