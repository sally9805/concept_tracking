Glory Alley ( M-G-M ) . A couple of shots of Louis ( " Satchmo " ) Armstrong as a fight trainer playing a trained trumpet almost make this little New Orleans melodrama worth the trouble . Also involved in the proceedings : a cocky prizefighter ( Ralph Meeker ) who quits the ring because of a mental block , but then proves himself a hero in Korea ; a ballet dancer ( Leslie Caron ) who hoofs in a honky-tonk to support her blind father ( Kurt Kasznar ) . Pretty Leslie ( An American in Paris ) Caron , playing a Belgian girl in America , is on her toes in a couple of dance numbers , but is otherwise miscast . Satchmo and Trombonist Jack Teagarden contribute a few hot jazz licks , but most of the picture is just tepid theatrics.
