txt Arab Legion of Jordan Due to Lose Its Glamour AMMAN , Jordan , May Lb ? The Arab Legion , Jordan 's British-trained Army , will be stripped of much of its glamour , and even its title , under a prozram revealed today . Defense Minister Mohammed Ali Ajlouni disclosed plans to abolish the Legion 's colorful uniforms and to merge the desert fighters with the Jordanian National Guard in an expanded modern force under the plain title the Jordanian Arn- , y . Members of the thirty-five-year-old Legion will be clothed in Western-style khaki if the project is approved by King Hussein . This would mean the abolition of the most distinctive feature of the Arab Legion , the colorful red - and - white khaffiya , or Arab headdress , now worn by all ranks in the Legion . In its place the Jordanian soldiers would wear military caps or khaki berets , similar to those worn by Egyptian and Syrian troops . Jordanian Army officers , who at present wear silver - colored buttons and badges of rank , would have them replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belts in favor of brown leather ones similar to those worn by oficers in British regiments . Mr. Ajlou // ni , a veteran soldier 63 years old , said in an interview that proposals for the reorganization of the Arab Legion were supported by Maj. Gen. Ali Abu Nuwar , the Legion 's new commander . The Arab Legion was built up by Lieut . Gen. Sir John Bagot Glubb of Britain , who was dismissed by the 20-year-old Jordanian monarch in March . General Glubb himself proudly wore the khaffiya . Mr. Ajlouni said that with the planned expansion of Jordan 's armed forces it was considered appropriate to change the Legion 's title to embrace the whole of the Jordanian Army . He declared the khaffiya headdress was " not practical , " adding that " it is not a military headdress but a civilian headdress . " The Defense Minister said the basis and spirit of the present Legion would remain unchanged , but the Legion would be modernized and the outlook of its troops brought up to date " on modern military lines . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deputy to Col. Frederick G. Peake , the British commander who formed the Arab Legion thirty-five years ago . The Jordanian spokesman said he had been one of General Glubb 's bitterest opponents . He charged that the former British commander of the Legion had " an autocratic mind " and believed and acted in an " outworn imperialistic manner . " Jordanian Poticy Is at Issue By SAM POPE BREWER Special to The New York Times . BEIRUT , Lebanon , May 26 ? The Kingdom of Jordan has become the great question mark of Middle East politics in the past two days . On Thursday King Hussein apparently threw in his lot with the " free officers " group . He promoted their leader , Ali Abu Nuwar , from lieutenant colonel to major general and made him Chief of the General Staff , second only to the King in Jordan 's military hierarchy . The " free officers " draw their inspiration from the military group that led Egypt 's revolution . They favor closer ties with Egypt . That , today , means that they oppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Beirut the questions in the minds of foreign observers are how far King Hussein intends to let Jordan slide toward the Egyptianled " neutralist " bloc , how much weakening of cooperation with the West that will imply , and how much control the King retains over those two developments . When the King dismissed the British Chief of the General Staff , Lieut . Gen. Sir John Bagot Glubb , General Nuwar was credited with having helped organize the move . One unverified report was that the " free ' officers " had made it clear to the King there would be trouble unless General Glubb went . General Nuwar was the King 's aide and was reputed to have been a close personal friend . He was considered to be reinforcing the personal authority of King Hussein . Even at that time it was generally believed that General Nuwar was slated to become the new commander within a short time . In the interim , the post was given , to Maj. Gen. Radi Enab as the Arab Legion 's most senior officer . General Enab remained twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of age . All that time General Nuwar 's influence was reported increasing . It was taken for granted that when General Enab 's retirement was announced , General Nuwar would replace him . What has raised questions and eyebrows is his recent increasing enthusism , in private conversation , for Egypt . He is reported to have said when he was in Beirut early this month that what Jordan needed more than a new Cabinet was just one strong man . He was talking against the fumbling of politicians rather than in favor of dictatorship , but it immediately raised the question of who was to be the strong man . At the age of 33 , General Nuwar has risen in a few months from major to major general , and more important , to the No. 1 officer under the King . For the Western powers there is the question of whether he will persude King Hussein to drop his past resolute support of the defense alliance with Britain . There is the question of whether the King would be able to refuse that if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possible high-level conflict on policies and a ' possible dissolution of the Parliament . For the King , there is the question of whether he will continue to take a strong personal hand in the Government , or whether the ardent young officers around General Nuwar will continue to exert pressure for the policies they favor . Two other men are outstanding in the officers ' group . Ali Hayari , just promoted to colonel and put in command of the armored brigade , was regarded by most British officers attached to the Arab Legion as Jordan 's most brilliant soldier . And Col. Sadek el-Sarah , who has just replaced General Nuwar as Chief of the Operations . All three have had the best training the British could provide . They all are intelligent , energetic officers in their early thirties . They represent the nucleus of a potent patriotic movement . Their conviction , however , appears to be that Jordan 's salvation lies with Egypt rather than with the Westren powers .                @ @ @ @ @
