T O many people , precocity in someone else 's child calls for heartfelt sympathy . The typical precocious child , they believe , is the one who learns Greek at the age of four , calculus at six and nuclear physics at eight , is graduated from Harvard at twelve , and at thirty is an addlepate who can barely hold a job selling crockery in the local department store . Recently a small army of workers has been conducting a study to determine once and for all whether infant prodigies really do " get over it " or whether they will maintain their mental superiority in adulthood . These workers  --  interviewers , mental testers , statisticians , physicians and psychologists  --  have investigated some 1500 of theseprodigies , and have checked with their parents , teachers , relatives , friends , wives , husbands and children . They have obtained information which few people will give to their doctor , lawyer or even clergyman . They have learned what becomes of the typical prodigy , how he grows up , what kind of job he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a two-generation , $200,000 research project  --  actually began thirty years ago , and is just now reaching its climax . It has been hailed one of the most exciting and significant investiga-tions in psychology . It has yielded data which may eventually bring drastic changes in the Amer-ican system of public education . And it has upset many of the time-honored beliefs dear to the hearts of parents , doctors , educators and the public at large . The investigators demolished one cherished super-stition when they found there is nothing to the idea that precocious children ? those with high IQ 's  --  are pathetic creatures , overserious and undersized , hollow-chested , stoop-shouldered , clumsy , tense and neurotic . " It would help our ego to believe that this is true , " one of them says , " but it is entirely false . " Furthermore , they reported , precocious youngsters are generally not obnoxious little brats ; most of them are remarkably free from behavior problems . And the child who learns Greek at the age of four and calculus at six , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are greater that he will become an executive vice-president , make $20,000 a year and marry the best-looking girl in town . These and similar findings have brought surprise , disillusionment and considerable annoyance to some people , and the investigators have been berated for wrecking many popular and comforting misconceptions . Oddly enough , they have also been denounced in some circles as subversive , un-American and undemocratic . The Man Behind the Test Behind the IQ TO the leader of these scientists , sprightly Dr. Lewis Terman , of Stanford University , such charges are the standard payment for exploding myths . Professor Terman is in a position to know . He had already caused a row when he proved he could learn more about a child 's intelligence with appropriate mental tests than a teacher could discover in a year or than some parents could discover in ten years . He saddened some educators when he stated that too many teachers failed to recognize exceptionally brilliant students . He stirred up resentment when he and his fellow brain testers reported that the average American adult had the mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied that any child could be made a genius by intensive mental calisthenics during the first four or five years of life , and when he disproved the widely accepted belief that many if not most of the world 's great geniuses were dunces in childhood . " It is true that Charles Darwin was rated as an intellectual failure by his teacher , " he said . " This was quite probably due to the fact that young Darwin was addicted to carrying insects and small animals in his pockets ? a habit which disturbed the serenity of the classroom . " The great author Sir Walter Scott was reputed to have been a mental flop when he attended a certain private school . Careful study revealed later that Scott never attended the school , and that in early childhood he was demonstrating remarkable literary skill . Other investigators have noted that Thomas Edison , usually at the foot of his class in school and considered bird-brained by his teacher , was showing an intellectual curiosity and reading books far beyond his years . " The evidence , " Terman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are most likely to develop into the world 's leaders  --  n politics , science , education , business and the arts . " Therefore , he suggested , such children deserve particular attention in the public schools and should have special classes , special training and special educational advantages . This sounded like heresy to some educators , and they assailed him as the No. 1 enemy of democracy . " These little disagreements have been inevitable , " he observed . " Some of our findings have made some people see red , and when they see red , they do not see very clearly . " This year , Terman celebrated his seventy-fifth birthday . At an age when most men are content to retire and relax or are too exhausted to do anything else , he is still working thirty or forty hours a week . His position is assured as one of the foremost psychologists of our times , the greatest living exponent of intelligence testing , and the man who largely popularized  --  although he did ( Continued on Page 42 ) PHOTOGRAPHY BY GENE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ( ontinued from Page 23 ) not invent  --  the phrase " intelligence quotient , " or " IQ . " He and his cohorts have sold intelligence testing as a valuable measuring tool to almost everybody but the communists . Russia has ruled out the tests as undemocratic and denounced Terman as a vile fascist . Undemocratic or not , the idea of training and utilizing specially gifted children is not new . " For many centuries , " Terman says , " the youthful prodigy was generally regarded with a mixture of admiration , awe and hopeful expectation . His parents were envied , and the child was likely to be made the prot  --  g ? of a prince or a king . " Then the stock of child prodigies plummeted . This nose dive came in the eighteenth century , along with the rise of Western democracy and the popularization of the idea that all men are born equal  --  not physically , of course , but mentally . It was widely held ? and is still apparently believed by a substantial proportion of the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that , with the proper education , any boy can become wise , wealthy and even President . Terman entered this emotionally supercharged field with what he termed all the misconceptions obtained from the most illustrious textbooks of the time . Born in Johnson County , Indiana , he was the twelfth of fourteen children . " My elementary education , " he recalls , " was obtained in a one-room ' little red schoolhouse ' which could not boast a single library book . . . . I entered this school three months before my sixth birthday , and at the end of the first term of six months was promoted to the third grade . Habitually , I memorized most of the contents of my textbooks . The school day was long , and the time had to be put in somehow . " At the age of fifteen he went to a teachers college , later to Indiana University , and then to Clark University at Worcester , Massachusetts , where he worked on early mental-testing techniques . He had tuberculosis and ( luring his years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hemorrhage . " It was perhaps fortunate for me that the doctors of that time knew so little , " he says . " Probably I should have been put to bed for from six to about twelve months , whereupon I would have gone to pieces from worrying about my wife , my two young children and my debts . As it was , I merely rested for a couple of weeks until my temperature had subsided , and then went back to work . " Although other physicians periodically warned him that his habits of intense work would bring him to an early grave from tuberculosis , Terman refused to change his schedule . He followed their advice only so far as to turn down glowing offers of jobs elsewhere and accept the position of high-school principal in the reputedly healthy climate of San Bernardino , California . He stayed there for a year , then moved to a state teachers college  --  now the University of California at Los Angeles  --  where he worked closely with Arnold and Beatrice Gesell , later to become famous for their studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join the faculty of Stanford University . While he was preparing material for his first lectures at Stanford , Terman became intrigued with the new mental tests recently devised in France by Dr. Alfred Binet . Introduced into the United States a few years before , the tests were still being attacked and ridiculed . Terman found nothing ridiculous in them , but he did see where they might be improved , expanded , and made more useful . In 1916 he and his Stanford coworkers came out with their first of several revisions  --  the StanfordBinet test , now probably the bestknown and most widely applied mental test in the world . Terman 's book on the examination , The Measurement of Intelligence , has been translated into nearly two dozen languages ? including Egyptian , Syrian and Afrikaans  --  and its sales have passed the 200,000 mark . They are still going up . The Stanford-Binet tests , like those developed by Edward Thorndike , of Columbia ; Robert Yerkes , of Yale ; Fred Kuhlmann , of Minnesota ; Arthur Otis  --  a student of Terman at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental age of a child . From that it is simple to get the intelligence quotient , or IQ , a term devised by the late William Stern , a pioneer investigator in the field of individual differences . To calculate the IQ , once you have measured a child 's mental age , you merely divide the mental age by the child 's chronological age , and multiply this answer by 100 . Today it is generally accepted that average children have IQ 's ranging from about 90 to 110 . Most feebleminded score 70 or less . Superior or gifted children usually rate at 130 or higher . Perhaps the most exciting and certainly one of the most significant investigations stemming from these intelligence measurements is Stanford 's large-scale psychological study of gifted children . " What we proposed , " Terman says , " was to sift a school population of a quarter of a million , identify about a thousand children with the highest IQ 's and study them  --  find their characteristic physical , mental and personality traits  --  and learn what sort of adults they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Commonwealth Fund , of New York , and later on from the Carnegie Corporation and the Rockefeller Foundation , of New York ; the Columbia Foundation , of San Francisco ; the Na tional Research Council ; the Marsden Foundation , of Palm Springs ; and the Thomas Welton Stanford Fund , of Stanford University . In addition , Terman made substantial contributions from the royalties he received from the sale of his tests . When the task of selecting the gifted children was begun , trained field workers went to the classroom teachers of hundreds of California primary schools and got the names of the brightest and youngest students in each class . These nominees were given standard mental tests , and the ones with IQ 's of 140 or higher became the first gifted children for the experiment . Others were chosen when their high IQ 's were discovered during routine mental testing in other schools . Eventually there were some 1500 of them ( 857 boys , 671 girls ) , ranging in age from three to eighteen , and representing the top 1 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranged from about 140 to 200 , with an average of approximately 150 for the group . The top score was that of a seven-year-old girl with a mental age of fourteen . These 1500 boys and girls soon became known as the " Termites , " although few of them were told of their selection as gifted children until many years had passed . They were also known for a short time as Terman 's Geniuses  --  a name which the professor strongly opposed . To date , none of them has become a rival of Einstein or Leonardo da Vinci . Nevertheless the group has become internationally famous by the manner in which it has upset hallowed traditions . The Termites first made news in psychological and educational circles when they showed up for their physical examinations . Doctors reported they were not the pathetic , hollow-cheated , round-shouldered , colorless , puny specimens supposedly typical of precocious children . Instead the Termites were stronger , huskier , taller and healthier than their average classmates . The typical gifted child was the child of parents who had had more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher-than-average income . His father was a professional man  --  a doctor , lawyer , professor or businessman . His home library contained an average of 328 books . He learned to read easily at the age of five or six . By the time he was ten he had been skipped one grade beyond his ( Continued on Page 47 ) ( Continued from Page 42 ) age group ; actually , however , careful testa showed that he had already mastered the school curriculum two or three grades beyond the one in which he was enrolled . At home , the typical Termite read more and better books than did most children , but he was clearly no bookworm . He played and knew the rules of more games than did his average schoolmates , engaged in sports just as successfully , and enthusiastically made collections of beetles , coins , Indian arrowheads and match covers . He was emotionally stable , quick in understanding and insatiably curious . He had a retentive memory and a large vocabulary , and was unusually interested in such things as number relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under temptation to cheat , and less inclined to boast or overstate his knowledge . His tendency to boast about his knowledge was determined by several methods , in one of which he was asked to indicate whether or not he had read such books as Dickens ' David Copperfield , Alger 's The Boy Inventor , Henty 's Running Away With the Circus , and Mark Twain 's Hobo Stories . Many children of average IQ reported they had read two or more of these ; the typical Termite admitted he had read none or only the first . The three other books have never existed . The investigators emphasized that the gifted children ranged widely in all their personality characteristics and family background . For example , although the average Termite came from a family with better-than-average income , some came from extremely wealthy homes while others were brought up in families with barely enough money to keep going . One boy , raised in poverty , had started his schooling at the age of seventeen ; within a relatively short time he had become a musical composer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of articles on musical theory , and in the space of three years he wrote a book on melody , composed sixty major orchestral pieces and learned two foreign languages . " These were our gifted children , " Terman says . " We knew what they were like as children . But how would they turn out as adults ? Would they live up to their promise of youth ? Or , as the textbooks predicted , would they fail miserably ? " Terman and his associates urged the parents of the Termites to raise their children as normally as possible . " Do n't place your child in a position which practically compels him to play the role of the child prodigy , " they said . " Do n't make him be a show-off . Let him associate normally in play and other social activities with children not too far from his own age . " They also advised the parents to refrain from hurrying the child through school in the shortest possible time . " Keep him profitably employed and give him every opportunity for , normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and help the child to help himself . Encourage hobbies . Provide the best books , and provide them in large variety . But remember that books are not everything . " One mother of a Termite told the Investigators she was still dressing and undressing her eight-year-old son , giving him his bath and providing all kinds of assistance which most sensible mothers teach their offspring to provide for themselves at an early age . " For my boy to do such commonplace things for himself , " she explained , " would rob him of the time he needs for creative thinking . " " Ye gods ! " cried Terman . " Creative thinking at the age of eight ? It makes no difference how gifted your child may be , he must be trained to be helpful and to have a sense of responsibility . " Most parents , he says , proved to be more sensible . As the years passed , they continued to welcome field workers into their homes and answer their questions , and to fill out the questionnaires which were periodically sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exact IQ of his Termites  --  a pledge which he has continued to keep , although some of the children or their parents divulged their identities themselves . He likewise has kept under lock and key the intimate details which many of the subjects began to reveal to him . Some of Terman 's questions called for surprisingly intimate information . " Those questionnaires he sent us every year wanted all the details , " relates Hollywood star Dennis O'Keefe , who recently revealed his membership in the Termite clan . " He kept close check , all right . Even knew who my first date was , and how I made out . My * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * mother did most of it , but when I hit the late teens , the questions got specific . Mother handed over the blank for me to fill out in private . " By the end of the war , when a major follow-up was under way , it was felt in some circles that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was sixty-eight . Three years before , reaching Stanford 's retirement age , he had become professor emeritus . Cataracts on both eyes had come close to destroying his vision , although successful operations were later able to restore his sight . He suffered seconddegree burns when his campus home ca ught fire . La ter he slipped and smashed his hip , and the doctors warned him he might be bedridden for life . Limping , scarred , wearing thick glasses , but just as perky as ever , Lewis Terman kept on the job . With him were many of the skilled associates who had collaborated in the previous surveys five , ten , twenty and even twenty-five years before , and who had taken leave from important and betterpaying positions elsewhere and postponed their own researches to work again with their former chief . When their report was finally published , it had heartening news for the parents of gifted children . The typical precocious child had not become stupid , committed suicide or , as some vulgarians observed , flipped his lid . The successful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy , well-adapted , versatile , happily married adult with a good job and a good income , many friends , a respected position in his community and a respectable record of contributing to his nation 's welfare . In comparison with average men and women of similar age , the gifted group as a whole had a lower over-all mortality rate . The divorce rate and the insanity rate were the same as the national average , but there was less alcoholism and much less delinquency . Roughly 88 per cent of the Termites had entered college and 68 per cent had been graduated , nearly half of these with high honors . Surprisingly , however , some sixty of them flunked out of college ; investigation revealed that these students were lazy , bored , unwilling to follow a professor 's instructions or were spending too much time in social life or earning a living . " It was obvious that a high IQ is n't the whole story , " one observer noted . " It 's important , but it 's not everything . " Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , and some went on to advanced training . Of the men who had completed their formal education and were working , a remarkably high proportion  --  slightly more than 80 per cent  --  had become professional or semiprofessional men or business executives . They were making brilliant records as lawyers , college professors , engineers , physicians , chemists , authors , newspapermen , artists and architects . The average income of the working Termites was about 70 per cent greater than that of average American men of the same age . " It would have been even higher if fewer of the men had become college professors , " Terman observed . " A professor 's salary always seems to bring down the average . " By 1945 about 85 per cent of both the gifted men and the gifted women had married . When the investigators checked on the spouses , they found that in most instances each Termite had married someone who also possessed a high IQ . In ten cases , one Termite married another . " In those ten cases , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told his spouse he was a Termite . The woman more often played it safe by keeping her intelligence a secret . " The survey likewise showed that the Termites had at least their fair share of military service . More than 40 per cent of the men served in the armed forces , rating everywhere from buck private to brigadier general . A hundred or more served in hush-hush militaryresearch projects . Politically , they were about equally divided between Republicans and Democrats . Only one member of the group admitted he was a communist . Eighty per cent of the eligible voters in the group reported that they had voted in the last national elections , in contrast to about 60 per cent for the national average . Finally , the investigators found , the Termites had made a significant impact on their country . Nearly 400 of the group had published more than 100 books or monographs and 1500 technical , scholarly or popular articles . The group had more than 100 patents to its credit , together with numerous scientific and medical discoveries . One Termite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of twenty , had turned to business , and at twenty-seven was chief investment analyst for a $40,000,000 educational foundation . Another , at the age of thirty-two , was co-ordinator of research in a $10,000,000 aeronautical laboratory . One woman , by the age of thirty , had become a successful professional actress , a professional dancer , an illustrator of anatomy and physiology textbooks , a novelist and a champion ice skater . Another was director of one of the biggest atomic research laboratories in the world . In contrast , one Termite listed as his major accomplishment , " I have just acquired my fifth wife . " Some of the Termites had run into trouble . One of these was a brilliant Hollywood director who recently admitted he had been converted at least temporarily to communism . Four of the men had been sent to jail  --  three as juvenile delinquents and one as an adult offender  --  for infractions ranging from minor thefts to forgery . A few others had close brushes with the law . One was a young boy whose zeal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments . " After his arrest , " his report reads , " the police department was so impressed by his ability that it gave him a job . His inventions later enabled him to earn $7000 while in his undergraduate years at college . Today he ranks among the most successful men in the gifted group . " Among the women , only two were reported to have had encounters with the police . One was arrested for vagrancy and sent to jail . The other , a professional prostitute for several years , was arrested a few times , but never served a jail sentence . " Both of these women , " it was announced later , " have apparently made normal behavior adjustments . " Although the group varied in extremes from complete business failures to one man now making nearly $300 , - 000 a year , and from a jailbird to a judge , Terman and his colleagues were far more interested in what happened to the average  --  to the group as a whole . And , they concluded , on the average , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far greater proportion than the general public or even college graduates in general . " A new survey , being conducted this year , seems to be furnishing further evidence to support this conclusion and , of particular importance , is indicating that the children of these Termites also have high IQ 's . For these and his other studies , and for building the Stanford psychologydepartment into one of the best in the country , Terman was awarded what are probably the two highest honors in his field ? presidency of the American Psychological Association and membership in America 's " scientific senate , " the National Academy of Sciences . After winning such distinctions , an ordinary man might sit down and relax for the rest of his life . Terman , however , has demonstrated no ability to relax . He has used his latest findings as ammunition in his toughest battle of all , his strenuously opposed attempt to have mentally superior youngsters given the same degree of specialized schooling which educators sympathetically give to the mentally defective . Actually a few such attempts have been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " opportunity groups " have proved highly successful for gifted youngsters allowed to learn as rapidly as their mental , physical and social powers permit . These classes have been expensive ? yet rarely more so than those for subnormal children  --  and often were dropped for budgetary reasons . Although it was recently estimated that more than 1,000,000 of America 's school children have " superior intelligence needing special education , " scarcely 21,000 of these 1,000,000 potential leaders were found enrolled in special classes . Terman himself has vigorously defended special training , for those who can assimilate it , as being thoroughly in line with the basic ideals of democracy . " It is no more undemocratic or discriminatory to provide special classes and instructors for the mentally gifted at the taxpayer 's expense , " he says , " than it is to provide football stadiums and expensive coaching staffs for the physically gifted . " He told a recent international meeting in San Francisco , " Surely the school has no more important task than to foster the development of the mentally gifted . Never has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places . Our chances of survival in another war may well depend upon the discovery and utilization of highly superior abilities of every kind . "
