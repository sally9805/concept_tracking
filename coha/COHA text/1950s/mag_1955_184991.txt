In an accident at the U.S. Air Force base in Bordeaux , France two months ago , Specialist 3/c Rodney Madeira , 20 , suffered third-degree burns over 30% of his body , with lesser burns over another 10% . He faced a long and dangerous period in the hospital while growing the skin he needed to cover the burned area . <P> Flown to the Air Force hospital at Wiesbaden , Germany , Madeira was swathed in dressings of erythromycin ( an antibiotic ) on fine-mesh gauze . In a month his wounds had healed enough for the doctors to start skin grafts . They covered 20% of the burned area with skin from Madeira 's left arm , then began looking around for a new source of supply . It was unfortunate , Chief Surgeon Major Philip A. Cox remarked to Madeira , that he did not have an identical twin , since only skin from the patient 's own body or from such a twin would do for a permanent graft . Replied Madeira : " I have one . " <P> Major Cox fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he was sitting down to lunch in Munsan , Korea , Army Cook Charles Ronald Madeira was told that he had emergency leave , in 15 minutes had started on the first leg of his trip to Germany . On the way , Charles Madeira , who had not seen his brother since they left their home town , Reading , Pa. , a year and a half ago , had some reservations ( " They ai n't hacking off none of my skin for nobody " ) . Later he decided to go through with the operation : " He 'd do the same thing for me-I hope . " <P> In Wiesbaden , Major Cox decided on the basis of preliminary evidence that Rodney and Charles were , indeed , identical twins . ( He will not be positive until the grafts have been given enough time to take . Normally , because the skins of different individuals have biological differences , grafts from one person to another wither and disappear within 30 to 60 days , although they have temporary value as a protective covering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surgeons took from Charles ' thighs and lower legs twelve strips two in. wide , 12 to 14 in. long and thirteen-thousandths of an inch thick , grafted them on to the burns on the lower part of Rodney 's body . Five days after the operation 95% of the graft apparently had taken . <P> Although doctors can not yet be sure whether the operation will be a permanent success , they can point to some encouraging , if rare , precedents in recent years . In 1952 Army Private Leonard Kijowski donated skin to twin brother Leo ( TIME . Feb. 4 , 1952 ) , and both made good recoveries . Last summer Major Cox treated an airman suffering from third-degree burns over 45% of his body area , saved his life when he chanced to spot his twin brother wandering around the hospital corridor .
