Psychopathic killers roam at large in two new movies : <P> The Sniper ( Stanley Kramer ; Columbia ) draws a melodramatic bead on a sex murderer ( Arthur Franz ) who goes around shooting brunettes with a telescopic carbine . It seems that he was unloved as a child . Similar in plot to the facts of Los Angeles ' recent " sniper " shootings , * the picture gives its story a San Francisco setting and a constructive , if somewhat superficial , plea for psychiatric treatment of sex offenders . The Sniper has a few sequences that hit the cinematic bull's-eye , notably a raw . realistic police lineup . But at times the picture appears unable to decide whether to set its dramatic sights on suspense or sociology . Unusual touch : old Boulevardier Adolphe Menjou , minus his mustache , playing a rumpled work horse of a police lieutenant . <P> Without Warning ( Allart ; United Artists ) is about a paranoiac ( Adam Williams ) who kills blondes with garden shears because his blonde wife walked out on him . Entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screenplay of Without Warning predated The Sniper by a year and a half . This unpretentious little thriller wisely plays it for straight action , and has a number of vigorous chases smartly filmed around Los Angeles with a newsreel camera . Independently produced on a shoestring budget of $92,000 , Without Warning is a rather promising first venture for four young moviemakers-Producers Jules Levy and Arthur Gardner , Director Arnold Laven and Scriptwriter Bill Raynor-who met while making World War II Air Force training films . Best sequence : a covey of blonde policewomen being staked out in bars as decoys to flush out the killer . <P> <P> * The sniper , 29-year-old Railroad Switchman Evan Charles Thomas , was caught last month after eluding the police for almost a year , during which time he killed one woman , wounded four others .
