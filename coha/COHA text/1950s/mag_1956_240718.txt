IN THE SHADOW OF THE GUILLOTINE ( 1,077 pp. ) - Rafael Sabatini-Houghton Mifilin ( $6 ) . <P> <P> He was born in Italy , the son of an English soprano and an Italian tenor , picked up an education in Switzerland and Portugal , became a British subject and a proper young businessman . But not for long . As soon as he could read , he had begun to devour history , and one day he left his proper job for the happier one of cranking out historical novels . Quote the opening line of one of his most famous ones- " He was born with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad " - and thousands of readers now living will know that it is from Scaramouche , by Rafael Sabatini . <P> A virile six-footer who , in costume , might have stood in for one of his own heroes , Sabatini was a tireless worker , and when he died in 1950 at 75 , he left a shelf of 36 novels that make most current historicals seem like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or time for what is sometimes called literary life , never read the novels of others , and probably did not think of himself as a novelist . But he knew all the tricks of the trade , and in his hands the historical was surefire . His plots are as tight and well woven as good wicker . The costumes fit , love and virtue always triumph , and the swordplay is the most expert , the flashiest since The Three Musketeers . <P> This week the nation 's bookshops are stocking a Sabatini bargain . In the Shadow of the Guillotine contains three novels with a French Revolution setting : Scaramouche , The Marquis of Carabas , The Lost King . Even people with literary pretensions can admire the expert workmanship . Others will simply enjoy the storytelling , the color , the sweep and energy that were Sabatini 's trademarks . Picking up this neat , compact volume , many an old fan will be glad to see him back .                  @ @ @
