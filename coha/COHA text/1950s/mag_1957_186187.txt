As the usual stream of brass moved through the Pentagon concourse last week , top Air Force men occasionally broke formation and glided unobtrusively into a suite of neat , quiet rooms . Their object : a thorough hangar check for heart disease . Since 1950 , more than 50 middle-aged Air Force executives-from the Secretary down-have undergone regular scrutiny by a team of Air Force specialists under Colonel Marshall E. Groover . The medicos can point to a fair record for the group : only 19 heart attacks , including six deaths ( among men who did not follow recommendations ) . But the Air Force program may prove most important for significant findings about the functions of diet and stress in heart disease . <P> Doctors have long believed that coronary heart disease is more prevalent among people subject to strong emotional stress , but just how stress does its damage has always been a mystery . With the discovery of large amounts of cholesterol in the blood of heart victims , many doctors switched the blame from stress to diet , since some fats are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Groover 's findings interrelate both stress and diet . <P> Canaps &; Cholesterol . Whenever Groover found cholesterol danger signs in a patient , he put him on strict diet and exercise . Of nearly 100 men in this category , 75% were thus restored to normal cholesterol levels . But some of the men developed high levels of cholesterol and lipoproteins ( fat compounds containing cholesterol ) even under the strict regimen . <P> At first , this was put down to laboratory errors or diet infractions ( one big executive temptation : the plentiful , high-calorie canapes at Washington cocktail parties ) .. Then it was found that in some men cholesterol and lipoprotein levels were highest during periods of great emotional stress . Investigation showed that lipoprotein levels were the first to rise when stress appeared , followed by a general rise in cholesterol level if it persisted . A check of the men turned up many cases in which stress seemed to be the only explanation for such fluctuations , and Dr. Groover believes that other cases may have gone undetected . To Groover and his aides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease by causing the body itself to produce extra cholesterol-entirely apart from foods that augment the body 's natural cholesterol supply . <P> Among Groover 's case histories was the story of Colonel M.B. , who worked for an unreasonable , hostile boss . His cholesterol level was high , but diet and exercise failed to help . When the boss was taken to the hospital ( with cerebral arteriosclerosis ) , Colonel M.B. 's cholesterol level showed a remarkable drop . Brigadier General F.R. 's cholesterol level was normal when he was assigned to Washington , but it shot up when he took over a demanding job in which he constantly had to meet deadlines ; a change of duty brought him down to normal .
