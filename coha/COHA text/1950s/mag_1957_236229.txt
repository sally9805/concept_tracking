NOBODY really knows all that goes on inside the Kremlin , but as Air Force General Nathan Twining said on his return from Moscow last year , there are " degrees of ignorance . " When the big news broke of the sacking of Molotov , Malenkov and Kaganovich , TIME began to dig for last week 's comprehensive coverage and this week 's Khrushchev cover story , tapping all the available intelligence sources in Warsaw , Prague , Belgrade . Bonn , Munich , London and Washington . To supplement the news and analysis from correspondents in the field . TIME called on the resources of its library of past Russian events , and its " Russian Desk , " presided over by two ex-Russian scholars . From all of these sources , Associate Editor Godfrey Blunden assembled and wrote TIME 'S stories of Nikita Khrushchev 's historic coup . <P> A globetrotting , Australian-born newspaperman , " Geof " Blunden has written ten previous TIME cover stories on Communist leaders in the past seven years . During World War II he was a war correspondent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the capture of Kharkov . He is also the author of two novels about Russia ( A Room on the Route , The Time of the Assassins ) , as well as a recently published satire on the second Geneva Conference ( The Looking-Glass Conference ) . For the product of his carefully acquired knowledge , plus that of a host of other students of the Russian scene , see FOREIGN NEWS , The Quick &; the Dead . <P> <P> IN the brambled woods of international affairs , the Eisenhower Administration operates on the proposition that acquaintanceship breeds understanding .

Last week Pakistan 's Prime Minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy arrived in Washington for a talk with President Eisenhower and a close look at the country . For a detailed report on the Prime Minister 's background , thinking , personality and private life , TIME queried its correspondents in Karachi and New Delhi . In Washington , TIME 'S reporters tapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public as well as private movements of the guest . Results of this study of the man who represents the stoutest U.S. ally in South Asia are reported in NATIONAL AFFAIRS , Pakistan 's Premier . <P> <P> THE big concrete shield of the cyclotron swung open , and a masked scientist dashed wildly down a 100-yard corridor in a race . His opponents : a set of disintegrating atoms . Though it was quite unlike the procedure normally associated with the grave and careful laboratories of science , the race was crucial to the performance of that increasingly difficult feat-the identification of a new element . The story of how the 100-yard dash helped a team of international scientists create element 102 is told in SCIENCE , Chemists , Run !
