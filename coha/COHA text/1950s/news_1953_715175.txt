txt GENEVA , Jan. ** recornImendation of the Tariff CommisIsion that United States import duI ties on briar pipes be ' increased , , widely reported in . the- ; European press today , has ** selected by Eurbpeari:trade officials , many of whom knew about it some time ago , as a. test ease for the ' intentions of the Eisenhower Administration in the foreign trade field . There are several reasons - why this case is assuming Such ' importance at this time in European minds , apart from the fact that it will be one of the first cases the new President will have to pass on . The ' President can overrule the recommendation of the Tariff Commission for a duty increase under the Reciprocal Trade Act as it now stands . It is considered here unlikely that President Truman will ' want to take the responsibility : for this decision off General Eisenhower 's hands . In ' the first place , briar pipes , furnished chiefly by Italy , France , Britain and Austria to the American market , already bear duties so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under high-wage American conditions has become an ' extremely expensive way of supplying pipes to consumers in the United States . The duties , as left by the Geneva tariff conference of 1947 , range up to 75 per cent , depending on the quality of the briar . Europeans have long felt , and it has been stated in numerous official analyses of trade problems , that if Europe is ever to earn enough dollars by its exports to maintain living standards without American aid , it must be done by concentrating on the production of // objects requiring a relatively high use of labor in production and relatively low use of costly machinery . Briar pipes fit that requirement . Second , European trade officials and businessmen want to know whether there is any limit beyond which the United States Government will not go in protecting an Aneeican industry that can not survive ( according to its spokesmen ) without protection . In nearly all industrial lines American production is so efficient that European manufacturers can hardly compete in one third of the markets even with the tremendous wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will efficient American industries be prepared to see their foreign markets closed down because Italy , France , Britain and other countries are not permitted to sell products in the United States in the production of which the United States is relatively inefficient ? Imports Held Hurting Sales Third , the pipe case is being closely watched because it is understood that the recommendation of the Tariff Commission was unanimous . This suggests that there was no possible doubt that pipe imports were threatening or ' actually causing serious damage to ' sales of United States producers . There can be no dodging the basic ' issues on the ground that imports are of minor importance or entering markets not supplied by American production , as has been instanced in some previous tariff cases carried up to the President . Europeans have read with interest suggestions by business groups and spokesmen for the Democratic Administration that some way be found to alleviate real ' hardship to American producers in such cases other than the exclusion of imports that harm and might ruin producers in allied countries . An industry that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to European ( and , incidentally , to many American ) trade experts to be an ideal one on which to try some method of government aid that would not place a further burden on American consumers . They are watching briar pipes for any sign that the new Administration may be thinking in terms of a substitute for tariff protection in such cases . Time for Decision Limited Should President Truman fail to settle the " battle of the briars " before Jan. 20 , he would leave President-elect Eisenhower relatively little time to make a decision ? no later than Feb. 28 . The date of the application tot ' an investigation into effects of I pipe imports , filed by the American Smoking Tobacco Manufacturers Association . was Dec. 28 , 1951 . The commission may take no longer than one year to complete a case . That time , of course , has run out  --  a sure sign that the commission has sent a report to the White House recommending a higher tariff or other restrictions on pipe imports . There are more than briar pipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there has been a steady flow of petitions to the Tariff Commission from domestic industries seeking relief faom alleged harmful effects of imports on which tariffs were lowered under the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act . This has been made possible by the " escape clause " inserted in the act by Congress . Under this clause , the Commission must carry out an investigation and hold hearings whenever " an interested party " feels that lowered tariffs have unduly increased imports . Many of these petitions have been rejected . While an investigation is under way , however , the effect is to stymie foreign exporters of the articles involved in carrying out marketing plans in fear of setbacks later . This result , together with import quotas placed on cheese and other dairy products , and the revival of " protectionist " tendencies by many members of Congress , has served to present an uncertain picture of United States foreign trade policy to other lands . A Test of New Policies In this light , the case of the briar pipes ? an important dollar earner from the standpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " alloy test " of the new Administration 's trade policies . This is particularly so because of the recent strong emphasis placed here and abroad on replacing aid with more trade . In the pipe case , the pattern is much the same as in other " escape clause " actions ? an era of good business during the war and immediate post-war years when foreign competition was slight , followed by a decline when this revived . Data presented to- the commission showed that the domestic pipe manufacturing industry in 1947 employed 3.140 persons and had a value of product shipped of $19 , - 325,000 . Prior to this , it had a steadily rising curve from 1937. when there were 2,559 employed , and shipments had a value of 57,647,000 . In 1950 , employment dropped to 1,602 and shipment value to $9,046,000 . Imports of briar pipes in 1950 ran in excess of $725,000 , and rose close to $1,000,000 in 1951 . In What is often referred to as the " narrow frame of reference " in which the Tariff Commission is supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product value , paralleled by a rise of imports of a competing nature , is a strong case for restrictions . The statement of a domestic pipe company executive was cited . He contended that the main problem for domestic pipe producers was overcoming a " defeatist " attitude toward selling their product . He decried lack of aggressive promotion to overcome the competition of cigars and cigarettes , and the presumed " inconvenience factor " in pipe smoking .
