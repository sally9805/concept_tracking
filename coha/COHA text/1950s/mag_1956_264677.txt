A CERTAIN SMILE ( 128 pp. ) - Franoise Sagan-Dutton ( $2.95 ) . <P> <P> A favorite pose of the very young is to abandon hope because they still have so much . One of the best-paid literary practitioners of this kind of premature despair is Paris ' intellectual gamin , Franoise Sagan , just turned 21 . As readers who pushed the sales of Bonjour Tristesse past the million mark know , Sagan wears her world-weary rue with a spicy difference . In her novels , sin triumphs over everything but syntax . This high-styled amorality led one French critic to sum up her work as " classicism in panties . " <P> Author Sagan is all set to repeat her success with A Certain Smile . More than 200,000 copies have been sold in France , and the U.S. publisher had 100,000 in print before publication . In Bonjour Tristesse , the teen-age heroine lived on cozy terms with her widowed father 's succession of mistresses until he proposed to marry one , at which point the daughter showed her claws and drove the poor woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandalous , and similarly concerned with Author Sagan 's thirst for drinking at the fountain of eternal middle age . This time the heroine ditches her schoolmate lover for an illicit affair with his married uncle . <P> Oasis on the Riviera . Dominique , the heroine , is a law student , but essentially a kind of sophisticated Gallic equivalent of a rock-'n ' - roller . She smokes incessantly , drinks Scotch methodically and goes to bebop dances at a nightclub called the " Kentucky . " ' Much of the time she is " bored passionately , " and her casual , completely physical love affair with Bertrand , a fellow student , rarely takes the edge off that boredom . Then Bertrand introduces her to his uncle Luc and Dominique decides hopefully : " He 's just the kind that seduces little girls like me . " <P> Luc is somewhat spavined and haggard , a kind of walking ruin of a rou , and , of course , old enough to be Dominique 's father . What makes their liaison inevitable is that they both fear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Author Sagan 's Sartrian thinking , respect each other 's freedom . Both cherish isolated moments of intense sensation , encountered rather like chance oases in the desert journey of what they regard as life 's everyday meaninglessness . After one passionate week on the Riviera stretches into two , Dominique finds that she can not hand Luc back to his wife in quite the airy way in which she took him . But Luc has not fallen in love , and before novel 's end , Dominique has to do the penance she has always detested-the waits by the telephone that does n't ring , the anguished , banal begging ( " I ca n't live without you " ) and the ever-present taste of ashes that even whisky will not wash away .
