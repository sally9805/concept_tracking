HEROIC HEART-THE DIARY &; LETTERS OF KIM MALTHE-BRUUN ( 177 pp. ) - Random House ( $3 ) . <P> <P> This eloquent book bears a Danish boy 's precocious witness to the hard scriptural paradox that he who loses his life shall find it . Seventeen and in love , Kim knocks around the Baltic as an apprentice on a three-masted schooner , fighting for peace within , while World War II rages around him . Soon this unschooled lad , who can write so tenderly to his sweetheart ( " May you sleep as sweetly as a water lily on a pond " ) , is looking into the hearts of others-the cough-racked Finnish soldier riding a blacked-out bus near the front , the old Danish widow clinging to life by keeping a dried-up Christmas tree by her bedside . Kim joins the Danish underground in the war 's last year , is caught and condemned to death . <P> By then , " all the layers of egotism , conceit , love and all the ups and downs of daily life " have been stripped away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentment or hatred at all , " he reports after being tortured . " The cleansing of the spirit makes you see the world from a new level way above what is known as pain or fear . " Most affecting of all the letters his mother has collected in this book is the one Kim wrote his sweetheart just before the Nazis executed him in April 1945 . Kim , then 21 , said : " Promise me-this you owe to everything I have lived for-that never will the thought of me come between you and Life . " The hardbought truths of Kim 's goodbye are valid for all the world 's bereaved next of kin .
