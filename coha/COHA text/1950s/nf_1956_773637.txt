txt // The band of light emerging from the business end of a spectroscope is called a spectrum . There are three types : ( 1 ) The continuous spectrum ? the familiar rainbow that you see when a beam of light is " spread out " by a prism . Incandescent solids or liquids or gases under high pressure produce a continuous spectrum . ( 2 ) The emission spectrum . This is produced by a luminous gas under low pressure . It consists of a series of bright lines at intervals along the rainbow band . ( 3 ) The absorption spectrum . This spectrum is produced when the light from the incandescent gas has to pass through a cooler gas before it reaches the slit that admits it into the spectroscope . The absorption spectrum is a series of dark lines . The cooler gas in the " reversing layer " of a star 's atmosphere rubs out the bright lines , leaving dark ones to replace them . Fortunately for science , it is highly selective in its action . The only bright lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if heated to sufficient temperature . Because of this favoritism , clhemical elements leave their fingerprints , in the form of particular patterns of lines , on the star 's spectrum . Now go on with the story . We are investigating a star that happens to be rich in , say , iron . Certain spectral lines are always associated with iron , and these will be strongly defined in the star 's spectrum . Well and good . Now we wish to ascertain whether or not there is any shift toward the violet or toward the red . To take this next step , we must compare the lines of iron , line for line , with another pattern of iron lines in a spectrum from a stationary source . Do n't get the idea that such a comparison is easy . There is nothing easy about it . And if I have given you the idea that the spectroscope itself is only a simple prism , please be disillusioned now . It is much more complicated . There may be a train of prisms to spread out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable because it increases the scale of spectrum and so makes more accurate measurement possible . Instead of a prism or prisms , the spectrum may be produced by a grating of very fine parallel lines , cut by a diamond point on a glass plate or on smoothly polished metal . Each of these tiny // grooves must be perfect , and the spacing between each has to be perfect too . Yet the number of lines may run from 10,000 to 25,000 or even more to the inch . It sounds impossible , but ruling engines have been devised that can produce such diffraction gratings to the astronomer 's exacting specifications . The spectrograph 3 must also include a heat source to vaporize the substance used for the comparison spectrum , in our particular example , iron . The intense heat of an electric arc turns a bit of iron into a glowing vapor . The light from this vapor is admitted into the spectrograph , and its spectrum is photographed on the same plate with the spectrum of the star . For best results , two comparison spectra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the pattern of iron lines shows even a minute displacement toward the red or toward the violet , the astronomer is able to detect it and measure it . The displacement toward the violet ( star approaching ) or the red ( star receding ) is measured in Angstrom units . These are so small they make the wave lengths of visible light seem large . One Angstrom unit ( abbreviated A ) is 1 hundred-millionth of a centimeter or 4 billionths of an inch . Nevertheless , a shift as small as 0.5 A can be easily detected by the men trained to do this sort of work . Some judgment has to be exercised to sort out our own motion from that of the star . It 's all one to the spectrograph whether the star is approaching us or we are approaching the star . The relative velocity is the only thing that it will determine . Our own motion is well known , however , and can be allowed for . To compute the star 's radial velocity by this method , we must know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be expressed in either miles or kilometers per second . If in miles ( 186,000 per second ) , the star 's velocity will also be in miles . ( b ) The wave length of any particular line , expressed in Angstrom units . Let 's call that value w. ( c ) The change of wave length for the line ( b ) . We 'll designate this // by 4w . The triangle ( delta ) says to a mathematician that this quantity is a little bit of w . The equation tying together these three quantities is surprisingly simple : Star 's radial velocity = velocity of light x Aw/w . To try it out , we have found a line in the blue-green portion of the spectrum , which is normally at a wave length of 5,500 A , as measured for Earthly light sources . In the stellar spectrum , this particular line has shifted 1 A toward the red . The fact of the red shift tells us immediately that the star is going away . To find out how fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X 1/5,500 33.8 miles per second . This may not be accurate to the last tenth of a mile , but it is accurate to a surprising degree . In some cases a precision better than one mile per second can be attained . Visible light occupies a restricted section of the electromagnetic spectrum , extending only from about 7,700 A at the red end down to 4,000 A at the violet end . The greatest possible change that can occur ? from the longest wave in the red to the shortest wave in the violet ? is from 0.000040 to 0.000077 centimeters . MOTION IN SPACE A few pages back I mentioned that from the point of view of a traveling star , the distinction between transverse and radial velocity is wholly artificial . Stars do not move in a series of zigzags across our line of vision and then toward us or away from us . Once we have determined these two components of a star 's motion , however , we can find out its true over-all velocity , usually referred to as space motion . Space motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its radial or line-of-sight velocity . The adding has to be done in a peculiar way . We will call the two velocities , transverse and radial , vl and v2 , respectively . They are added in this way : figure // Try it on Arcturus . As we already know , its transverse velocity is 67 ? miles a second . The line-of-sight velocity is small ? only 2 ? miles a second . The space motion of Arcturus therefore is figure Practically no difference from the transverse velocity . We conjecture that Arcturus must be moving almost perpendicularly to our line of sight . This can easily be proved or disproved by finding the angle that the space motion makes with the line of sight . The angle is not measurable , but it can be found by elementary trigonometry . The tangent of the angle is the ratio of the velocities vl and V2 . For Arcturus , the ratio is 67 ? : 2 ? = 27 . Now all we have to do is to find the particular angle that has a tangent of 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step . It tells us that the angle whose tangent is 27 is ( very nearly ) 87 ? 53 ' . Our guess was right ! Arcturus is moving almost at right angles to the line of sight . Chapter 13 TELESCOPES AND RADIO TELESCOPES Mirror , mirror , burning bright , Snaring stars in points of light , Where 's the hand , 0 where 's the eye , Dare frame thy fearful symmetry ? * Tycho Brahe , 1546-1601 , who died just a few years before the invention of the telescope , compiled tables of planetary paths to amazing accuracy . After Tycho 's death , his erstwhile associate , Johann Kepler , found that his calculations for the orbit of Mars were failing to agree by eight minutes of arc with the Danish astronomer 's observed positions . Theory must be wrong : Kepler knew Tycho . Never in his life had careful Tycho made so gross an observational error as eight minutes of arc . " With those eight minutes , " pledged Kepler , " I will yet find out the law of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomy condemned to observations with the naked eye . In 1608 a Dutch spectacle maker , Hans Lippershey , was holding a lens in each hand when he chanced to look through both of them toward a distant church // steeple . Miraculously , the weathercock seemed closer . The next step was to fit the two lenses in a tube and ? behold ! ? a telescope . ( The name was coined from two Greek words meaning " to see far . " ) The wonder of it quickly spread throughout the civilized world . In Venice about a year later , a professor of mathematics of the University of Padua was told of the new instrument that brought distant objects up close . Galileo Galilei was not shown one of Lippershey 's telescopes , merely informed of its existence . It was enough . He rushed back to Padua and visited spectacle makers to find a concave and a convex lens . Insterted in a lead pipe , one at each end , they magnified three diameters . Galileo set to work to make a better instrument . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdiction of Venice , he presented his second telescope to the Doge . In return he received life tenure of his lectureship at Padua at double the old salary . Telescope making had paid off . The spectacle makers were n't able to produce lenses big enough for Galileo ; he learned to grind his own . When he could make them about two inches in diameter , he produced a third telescope . It was 4 feet long and able to magnify 32 diameters . With it , he chalked up an impressive string of astronomical firsts ? lunar peaks and craters , stars fainter than sixth magnitude , sunspots , phases of Venus , four moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn . He failed to recognize the rings as such , believing them to be very close moons . After a time they confounded him by going away . Exasperated , Galileo stopped watching Saturn . Forty years later the Dutch astronomer , Christiaan Huygens , cleared up the mystery of Saturn , but in that interval important changes had been made in telescope design . Galileo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refracting telescope consists , basically , of a transparent convex lens , called the objective or object glass , and a smaller lens or eyepiece . The first lens , the objective , bends the incoming parallel beams of light into a cone . The tip of the cone is called the focal point . The distance from the center of the lens to the focal point is the focal length of the lens . A plane passed through the focal point // at right angles to the line of sight is known as the focal plane . The focal plane is where the image is formed ; it may be likened to the ground glass at the back of a camera . Galileo 's object glass was a double convex lens . For his eyepiece , he used a double concave lens and positioned it to intercept the converging light rays before they came quite to a focus . The eyepiece was thus on the near side of the focal point . Kepler ? yes , the same Kepler who had worked with Tycho Brahe ? suggested improvements . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point and should be convex , not concave . Under this system , the length of the telescope would be the combined focal lengths of the object glass and of the eyepiece . The magnifying power would be the ratio of the two , the focal length of the objective being divided by that of the eyepiece . If the eyepiece is made quite small ( short focal length ) as compared to the objective , a high magnification can be obtained . It is not on record that Galileo ever made a telescope along the above lines . Nor did Kepler ; he was a man who worked with his head , not his hands . The Keplerian telescope has a disadvantage : it inverts the image . A man looked at through this type of refractor will appear to be standing on his head . However , it does n't in the least matter if a star or a planet stands on its head . Such was the prestige of the Paduan professor that his contemporaries also ignored Kepler 's design . A really good idea never dies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Keplerian telescope was in , and the Galilean telescope had dwindled to opera glasses , for which it is still being used . With Kepler 's convex eyepiece and an objective ground for 12-foot focal length , Christiaan Huygens was able to see Saturn 's rings as what they are and to discover the biggest Saturnian moon , Titan . Huygens and his brother ground object glasses for focal lengths of 180 and 210 feet . Afterward , focal distances grew even greater , which does not mean that huge lenses were being ground . These object glasses were actually no more than a few inches in diameter , but they were ground to very slight curvature , which increased the focal distance . One lens is said to have been ground for a focal length of 600 feet . No tube could then be constructed for anything // like this distance . Wires or a long wooden trough had to hold the alignment of the lenses in these " aerial telescopes . " The object glass was fastened on as high a tower as could be found or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best to keep the eyepiece in correct focal position . It is a wonder that these unwieldy tubeless telescopes could be used at all , but important discoveries were made with them ; to wit , more of Saturn 's moons and the first measurement of the diameter of Venus . Something was seriously wrong with the refracting telescope : the best object glass that could be ground gave a blurred image . True , a rather poor quality of optical glass was being made in those days , but the major difficulty seemed to be inherent in the nature of the convex lens . It took the supreme authority on light , Isaac Newton , to diagnose the trouble . When light is bent ( refracted ) , it is also dispersed according to color . Thus in a refracting telescope , each color has a slightly different focal length , red being farther away from the lens than blue or violet . Focus your telescope for a sharp image with red , say , and the other colors will be out of focus . This is known as chromatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never be overcome in the refracting telescope . The only way to improve the telescope is to throw out the refractor and make a telescope of an entirely different type . A telescope that would reflect light to a focal point had been suggested in 1663 by James Gregory . A theorist like Kepler , Gregory was unable to produce such a telescope except on the drawing board . In 1669 Newton took time off from such brainwork as developing the calculus and calculating the laws of universal gravitation to prove that he was also a good man with his hands . He succeeded in constructing the world 's first reflecting telescope . Newton had to start wholly from scratch . Of what should the mirror be ? Not glass , that was certain ; there was no way by which glass could be coated with a reflective surface . Some metal or alloy ? Newton had to find one . He used 12 parts of copper , 4 of tin and 1 of white arsenic . The " speculum " was cast and polished // to spherical curvature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second reflecting telescope to the Royal Society ; it had a magnifying power of 38 diameters . Just as early refractors suffered under the disease of chromatic aberration , so were early reflectors plagued by an ailment called spherical aberration . The convex lens experienced the same difficulty but not to the same degree as the concave mirror . In a mirror of spherical curvature , light rays reflected from the middle portion do not focus at the same point as light reflected from the rim . The cure is to polish the mirror to paraboloidal curvature , a step that any exacting amateur of today follows as a matter of course . Newton deemed parabolic figuring too difficult , as it was then . Nobody in Europe was able to make a paraboloidal mirror until after Newton 's death . Around 1732 a young Scot learned how . James Short , a student at Edinburgh University , was permitted to make use of the college rooms for experiments with telescopes . He tried figuring glass , easier to work with than metal , but glass mirrors were wholly impractical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and middle alike would reflect their light to the same focal point . Spherical aberration had been licked . Other problems had not been . Eighteenth-century mirrors were cast from speculum metal , an alloy of copper and tin , not quite the same as the formula used by Newton . A mirror of speculum metal can be given a bright , beautiful polish , but it tarnishes . Worse , the tarnish can be removed only by grinding it off , which destroys the figure . Speculum-metal mirrors have comparatively short service life and are , furthermore , as difficult to work with as a temperamental opera star . The alloy is so brittle it shatters like glass if dropped . After it has been cast , it must be cooled very slowly ( annealed ) to prevent it from cracking in the mold . Grinding and polishing are difficult too ; the material is so hard that a file hesitates to scratch it . Despite its many disadvantages , speculum metal was the best substance available , and it continued to be used for telescope mirrors for nearly two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a 61 ? inch reflector cast from speculum metal . Herschel cast , ground // and polished his own mirrors , and they were the best the world had yet seen . He made one of 18 ? inch diameter for a 20 ? foot telescope and another of 48 ? inch diameter for his great 40 ? foot telescope . Instruments of real power were probing the heavens . All size records for the speculum mirror , however , were shattered in 1845 by the third Earl of Rosse . This Irish peer , an enthusiastic amateur , carried his hobby to such extravagant lengths as to figure a 72 ? inch mirror for his private observatory at Parsontown , Ireland . Pointed toward Canes Venatici , the giant reflector revealed the structure of a spiral nebula for the first time . This was the swan song of the speculum mirror . In 1856 a German physicist , Dr. Karl August Steinheil , found a way to coat a glass mirror with silver . It is time to return to refractors , which had taken a new lease on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moor Hall , an English country gentleman , argued from the analogy of the human eye that nature knew how to refract all colors of light to identical focus . If nature could , so could man . Hall first and later John Dollond , of London , proved that a compound lens of crown and flint glass will overcome chromatic aberration . Newton was wrong . An object glass for a refracting telescope usually consists of a double convex lens of crown glass next to a plano-concave lens of flint glass . One works against the other , but since the concave flint has only about half the power of the convex crown , the dual lens is still able to function as a refractor . Instead of being dispersed , however , the different colors are brought by the flint glass to almost the same focal point , which is at about twice the focal distance of the crown lens alone . This discovery did for the refractor what parabolic figuring had done for the reflector . The next big step was the production of bigger and flawless disks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glassmaker , possessed this secret at the beginning of the nineteenth century and imparted his art to 18-year-old Joseph von Fraunhofer , of Munich . After learning the technique of casting large and perfect disks , Fraunhofer developed methods of his own for grinding and // polishing them . Previous object glasses had been limited to sizes of four or five inches . Fraunhofer was able to shape two of 15 ? inch diameter , one going to Pulkovo Observatory in Russia and one to Harvard Observatory . A refracting lens is vastly more difficult to make than a mirror of corresponding size . After Fraunhofer 's death , a second genius in this particular line developed in Alvan Clark , portrait painter of Cambridge , Massachusetts . Traveling in Europe , Clark happened to see some rough disks of optical glass for small telescopes . Though he knew little , if anything , about optical instruments , the glass blocks cried aloud to him to be shaped . He bought a few and began to experiment . In a comparatively short time he was in the telescope business professionally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size record with an 18 ' ? inch lens . This is now at Dearborn Observatory , Northwestern University , Evanston . It had originally been ordered by the University of Mississippi , but the Civil War prevented delivery and the lens was sidetracked to Chicago . This was barely the beginning for Clark and the sons who joined him in the business . Their object glasses kept growing bigger and bigger : a 26 ? inch lens for the United States Naval Observatory , Washington , D. C. ; another 26 ? inch for McCormick Observatory , University of Virginia , near Charlottesville ; a 30 ? inch for Pulkovo Observatory , near Leningrad ; and a 36 ? inch for Lick Observatory near San Jose , California . As its supreme accomplishment , the firm of Alvan Clark and Sons , telescope makers extraordinary , figured the great 40 ? inch refractor at Yerkes Observatory , University of Chicago . Located at Williams Bay on beautiful Lake Geneva , Wisconsin , Yerkes has the largest refracting telescope in the world . Because of its great aperture and long focal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexcelled for fine determinations of parallax . In fact , the photographic techniques by which stellar parallaxes are measured ( Chapter 11 ) originated at this observatory under the direction of Frank Schlesinger ( 1871 ? 1943 ) . Other large refracting telescopes are the 32 ? ? inch in the Astrophysical Observatory , Meudon , France ; the 311 ? inch in the // Astrophysical Observatory , Potsdam , Germany ; the 30 ? inch at Nice , University of Paris ; the 28 ? inch , Royal Observatory , Greenwich , England ; the 30 ? inch photographic refractor , Allegheny Observatory , University of Pittsburgh ; the 27 ? inch , University of Michigan , Bloemfontein , South Africa ; the 231/2 ? inch , Bosscha Observatory near Bandung , Java ; the 26 ? inch , Yale University , Canberra , Australia . The new techniques for the casting of optical glass equally favored the growth of reflectors . A great gain in reflectivity was obtained with accurately figured glass mirrors plated with a thin coating of silver . Longer mirror life was another benefit . Silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its reflecting power can be restored by a chemical bath . Now silver is going , if it has n't already gone , the way of speculum metal . A vacuum process can " aluminize " glass . Reflectivity of the aluminum film is nearly as high as that of freshly deposited silver , and it tarnishes very little after initial oxidation . Aluminum also reaches farther into the ultraviolet . Win , place and show in the reflection race have all been won by California observatories . As all the world knows , the world 's largest telescope is the 200 ? inch Hale telescope , California Institute of Technology , on Palomar Mountain , 66 miles north of San Diego . The distinction of being second largest , long held by the older 100 ? inch reflector , Carnegie Institution , on Mount Wilson , overlooking Pasadena , recently passed to Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton , which has a new 120 ? inch reflector . An electronic gadget is expected to render larger telescopes than the California Big Three unnecessary . Instead of building a bigger mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by attaching an " image converter , " which will intensify the light before it reaches the photographic plate . Claim is made that this electronic device , now under intensive development , will ultimately so increase sensitivity that present telescopes will be able to see ten times as far into space . Instead of being limited to a mere 2 billion light-years , the 200 ? inch telescope can extend its radius to 20 billion light-years . Others of the world 's largest reflectors are : 82 ? inch , McDonald // Observatory , Mt . Locke , Texas , University of Texas and University of Chicago ; 74 ? inch , Radcliffe Observatory , near Pretoria , South Africa ; 74 ? inch , Commonwealth Observatory , Mount Stromlo , near Canberra , Australia ; 74 ? inch , David Dunlop Observatory , University of Toronto , Richmond Hill , Ontario ; 72 ? inch , Dominion Astrophysical Observatory , Victoria , British Columbia ; 69 ? inch , Perkins Observatory , Ohio Wesleyan University , Delaware , Ohio ; 61 ? inch , Oak Ridge ( Massachusetts ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Station , Harvard University , Mazelspoort , South Africa ; 481 ? inch , Berlin-Babelsburg , Germany ; 42 ? inch , Lowell Observatory , Flagstaff , Arizona ; 40 ? inch , Naval Observatory , Washington , D.

Holcomb Observatory , Indianapolis ; 371h ? inch , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor ; 36 ? inch , Lick Observatory , University of California , Mount Hamilton ; 36 ? inch , Catholic University , Santiago , Chile ; 36 ? inch , Steward Observatory , Tucson , Arizona , 30 ? inch , Agnes Scott College , Decatur , Georgia ; 24 ? inch , University of Michigan Observatory near Portage Lake , Michigan ; and 24 ? inch Baker reflector-corrector , Vanderbilt University , Nashville , Tennessee . Yes , reflectors do run much bigger than refractors . There are also more of them . Beginning with Fraunhofer 's two 15 ? inchers , altogether 16 refractors and 23 reflectors have been mentioned . Which is the better telescope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends ... " Probably the reflector is the better instrument where lightgathering power is the primary consideration , as in photographing faint nebulae . The reflector is well adapted to team up with the spectrograph and to observations of planetary disks . It is not to be recommended where precise measures of star positions are wanted , as in determinations of parallax and proper motion . The refractor is the proper telescope for these chores . Whether reflector or refractor , all big telescopes are mounted equatorially . Perhaps this should be explained . The main axis of the mounting , called the polar axis , is inclined to the horizon at an angle equal to the latitude of the observatory . // Hence the polar axis is always pointing toward a celestial pole , north or south depending upon the hemisphere . The polar axis supports a second axis , at right angles , which carries the telescope . This is called the declination axis . The telescope is able to tilt up or down on the declination axis or to swing completely around the polar axis . Graduated circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its heavenly target . The circle of the polar axis is graduated in hours and minutes of right ascension ; the declination axis circle in degrees and fractions of degrees . Once on target , the telescope is turned by precision clockwork or by a synchronous alternating-current motor at a rate of one rotation per sidereal day ( 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds ) . It is carried around the polar axis in an east-to-west direction at exactly the velocity of Earth 's rotation from west to east . Earth 's rotation is thus canceled , and the telescope remains on the same hour line or fraction thereof . With little if any human attention , it will stay centered upon its object for as long as may be needed . The alternative to equatorial mounting ? used only with small telescopes ? is called altazimuth . This also has two graduated circles , allowing the telescope to be shifted in altitude ( angle of elevation above the horizon ) or in a circle around the horizon , azimuth . Altitude and azimuth will both vary as a star rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sky to set in the west . The observer has to be continually adjusting both circles in order to keep the ' scope fixed upon a star . Up to now little has been said about the principles on which reflecting telescopes are constructed . The concave mirror reflects the light into a cone , exactly as the object glass of a refractor bends it . Since the mirror is at the lower end of the tube , the parallel beams of starlight are reflected to a prime focal point near the upper end of the tube . This order is exactly the opposite from a refractor , which has its object glass at the top and the focal point conveniently near the lower end of the tube . The focus-at-the-top arrangement introduces a problem with reflectors that was never encountered with refractors ; namely , how is the observer going to be able to see the image without blocking out the starlight ? // Some of the solutions found are no longer being used . Four methods , however , have survived the test of time : Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a photographic plate , is stationed inside the telescope , right at the focal point . The 200 ? inch telescope has a rigidly mounted cage inside its tube to hold the observer . The amount of light blocked out by the cage is not considered significant in comparison with the nearly 17 ? foot diameter of the big mirror . The new 120 ? inch telescope at Lick was also designed with a prime-focus cage . Telescopes smaller than these two giants are not able to mount a man , but some can and do mount photographic plates at the prime focus . Newtonian . Either a flat diagonal mirror ( similar to your rearview mirror ) or a prism is mounted inside the tube just in front of the prime focal point . The mirror or prism deflects the light at right angles , and the image is viewed from an eyepiece at the side of the tube . The Newtonian form is widely favored by amateur astronomers because of its convenience . It is not so convenient for a big observatory telescope . The eyepiece must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform has to be erected for the observer . Other Newtonian advantages such as short focus and brightness of image are retained with big telescopes . Cassegrainian . The converging cone from the primary mirror is intercepted by a convex hyperboloidal mirror . This tosses the reflected starlight back toward the main mirror and directs it into a hole in the center , through which it passes to an eyepiece . The eyepiece is immediately in back of the main mirror . This arrangement puts the eyepiece at the lower end of the tube , as with the refracting telescope . The Cassegrainian form has a considerably longer focus than the Newtonian and so is usually able to produce higher magnification . Coude . This is the most intricate setup . The Coude form resembles the Cassegrainian to the extent that a convex hyperbolic mirror reflects the light backward before it comes to a focus . However , the light is not allowed to reach the main mirror but is deflected at right angles by a flat mirror and directed through the hollow declination axis . A second flat mirror deflects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The eyepiece may be at the base of the polar axis or even in a room below the telescope , where an observer can watch the skies in comfort on frigid winter nights . The Coude has a very long focal length , but its many mirrors cause loss in brightness . As each of these methods has its particular advantages , modern reflectors are usually built to switch from one to another . All that has to be done is to change the secondary mirrors . In the Hale telescope , the unwanted mirrors are folded back against the wall of the tube by remote electrical control , and the proper mirrors for the desired arrangement are unfolded . Used as a primary focus , the 200 ? inch has a focal ratio of 3.3 and a focal length of 55 feet . As a Cassegrainian , the focal ratio is 16 and the equivalent focal length is 267 feet ; as a Coude , the focal ratio is 30 and equivalent focal length is 500 feet . A growing legion of amateur astronomers are deriving pleasure and satisfaction from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of York , Pennsylvania , may be taken as representative . The writer interviewed Mr. Messner in his basement workshop . It was a good time for the interview , if not for Messner , because he was preparing a new tube to hold his 8 ? inch mirror . I saw a riveted 9 ? inch cylinder of 1/ 6 ? inch aluminum aircraft alloy , six feet long . With an f.8 focal ratio , the focal length of this Newtonian telescope is 64 inches . The new tube was clamped to a workbench and Messner was engaged in aligning the mounting for the mirror cell with the ocular holder on the outside of the tube . Unless this alignment is perfect , the diagonal mirror will not deflect the top portion of the light cone to the focal point of the eyepiece . Messner said he had to work to hundredths of an inch . " But that 's nothing compared to the mirror . The allowable degree of error in the surface is about fifteen millionths . " " Millionths of an inch ? " " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , never mind , " I broke in as he started to tell me . " We 'd better go farther back . What do you have to do to make a mirror ?

" Toward the end , " he confessed , " I was spending at least two hours in testing for every hour of actual work on the mirror . " " What do you start with ? " " Two flat glass disks of the same diameter and thickness . You rub them together , one above the other . The upper disk will become your mirror . The lower one is the tool . The upper one gets concave and the lower one convex as you continue grinding . That 's a natural action . Of course , you help it along with abrasives . " As he talked , the picture began to emerge .

" How long do you keep up the grinding ? " " Until you get the rough spherical curvature . " " How do you know ? " " You gauge the depth of curvature with a template . That you have to make yourself . I nailed a long stick to the floor , loosely so I could move it like a compass arm , and drove a nail through the other end to mark with .

You polish and test , polish and test , polish and test , polish some more . You keep this up until you 've hit perfect spherical curvature . " " How do you test ? " " The Foucault knife-edge test . I 'll show you . " Mr. Messner set his mirror up on its edge , inviting me to step up and look into it . I did . Close up , it seemed perfectly flat and reflected like any other mirror . I was disappointed . " Where 's your magnification ? " " Step backward and keep looking at it . " With every step back , my mirror image grew larger and the amount of face shown decreased proportionately . As I approached the focal distance , the only part of me being reflected was one eye , which filled up the entire 50 square inches . To be regarded by that gigantic pupil was a weird experience . The Foucault knife-edge test calls for a pinpoint light source . Messner supplied this by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe tobacco . An old razor blade was the only other thing needed . The blade was fixed vertically into a split round stick , which had been driven into a hole drilled in a block of wood . This simple equipment sufficed to establish a curvature accurate to millionths of an inch . In the Foucault test , the pinpoint light source is set at the same height as the center of the mirror , a little to the right of the mirror 's center of curvature . The room is then darkened . From most points of view , the pinhole is reflected from the center of the mirror . As // the tester 's eye approaches the center of curvature , however , the reflected light suddenly expands until it floods the entire mirror . When he sees this dazzling sight , the tester moves in the " knife edge " from the left . If the edge is inside the center of curvature , a shadow will come into the mirror from the left . If the edge is outside the center of curvature , the shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curvature has to fall somewhere between . You keep shifting the block . At the exact center of curvature , the mirror will suddenly go black over its entire surface . That is , it will if it has perfect spherical curvature . " " What if you ca n't make it go black by shifting the blade edge ? " " You keep on polishing till you can . And keep on testing . " With enough patience and persistence , a perfect spherical curvature is attained . Newton stopped there , but not Fred Messner and others like him . The next step is to deepen the curvature very slightly in the center ; that is , to " parabolize " the mirror . The difference between spherical and paraboloidal curvature is very small ? only a few millionths of an inch ? but that tiny extra depth is what gives every part of the mirror exactly the same focus . " How do you get out that bit in the center ? " " You polish in a different way . You have to use a longer stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That polishes away the center faster than it does the edges . It does n't take much . Just a little extra polishing , and then you test again . " " Another knife-edge test ? " " Yes , but more complicated . What you must do is to shift the center of curvature by a very small amount . You marked the center of spherical curvature from the previous test . Now you move the knife edge back a small distance . How much depends on the formula r2/R , where r is the radius of the mirror and R is the radius of the curvature . For my 8 ? inch mirror and 64 ? inch focal length , the knife edge goes back % inch . " " Does it black out the mirror again ? " " That only happens with spherical curvature . You have to mask the mirror and watch the darkening on the outer rim . It has to darken evenly . It 's hard to describe . What I did was to keep studyTelescopes // ing pictures of what I should get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hit it right at the second test . " " Is parabolizing hard to do ? " " The hardest part . There are so many things you can do wrong : turn up the edges , turn down the edges , develop a doughnut ridge around the center or a doughnut ditch ? oh , a whole slew of things ! If you cut too deep anywhere , you have to grind the whole surface flat and start it all over again . Some people never do make it . " " When and if you do , what then ? " " The mirror 's ready for plating . " " Do you plate it yourself ? " " No , and I do n't know anyone who does . It 's tricky . The coating is only a few millionths thick . The metal has to be vaporized and sprayed on in a vacuum . " " What kind of metal ? Aluminum ? " " An alloy called Ber-al . I suppose it has beryllium in it . It gives a hard surface and reflectivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , either . This mirror is four years old , and you can see it 's in good shape . " It looked brighter than a newly minted coin . " What kind of mounting do you have ? " " Equatorial . I can keep it lined up with a star by turning a crank , but I have to turn the crank . Some day I 'm going to hook up a motor . I 'll have to gear it so the ' scope will make just one rotation in a sidereal day . " " You must have quite a bit of money tied up in this ' scope , Fred . " " Not so much as you might think . I had to buy the disks , of course , and all the grinding and polishing stuff . It cost me six dollars to plate the mirror . I bought the mirror cell and ocular holder and the diagonal and several different eyepieces . The tube I had rolled from flat stock in a sheet-metal shop . Altogether , I guess I spent about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars is all it takes for the amateur astronomer to have a perfect instrument with which to // watch the heavens . Plus considerable manual labor , mechanical aptitude , a good stock of stick-to-it-iveness and inexhaustible patience . But there 's a fascination about telescope making that brings its own reward , independent of the satisfaction to be found in observing . The layman is apt to think that the only purpose of a telescope is to magnify . A telescope does magnify , naturally , but it also collects and concentrates light . Light-grasp is of greater concern to the astronomer than magnifying power . A small bright image will show up more clearly than a larger but fainter one . You know that from your own experience . When you want to examine something in detail , you may reach for a magnifying glass , but the chances are your first thought will be to bring it closer to the light . The more light that can be collected from a star , the farther it can be spread by the spectrograph and the more accurate will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now why light-grasp is so important . There is only one way to gather more light , and that is to build a bigger telescope . Light-grasp varies as the square of the diameter of the object glass or mirror . When you graduate from a 2 ? inch to an 8 ? inch telescope , you will be collecting 16 times as much light . Magnification follows a different law . It depends on the eyepiece as much as it does on the size of the object glass or mirror . By changing eyepieces , a variety of magnifications can be obtained with the same telescope . A small eyepiece , having a short focal length , can step up the magnifying power in accordance with the formula figure where F = focal length of the objective and f = focal length of eyepiece . You may possibly be thinking that you have only to insert an eyepiece of sufficiently short focal length to obtain any magnification you please . Unfortunately , it 's not so . When you magnify an image , the original light has to be spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , the light must be // spread over 100 times the area , with consequent decrease in brightness . " The larger the fainter " is a law that can not be broken when you are limited to the fixed quantity of light that can be gathered by the telescope . The theoretical maximum magnification for any telescope is about 100 times each inch of aperture , " aperture " meaning either object glass or mirror . Fifty times each inch of aperture is considered more practical . Following the 50 rule , the 200 ? inch telescope should be able to magnify to 10,000 diameters effectively . A second stumbling block gets in the way , however , and that is the effect of Earth 's atmosphere . Air is ordinarily no more still than the surface of a pond ; it ripples and vibrates so , as Saint Paul once said , " We see through a glass , darkly . " Magnification is no cure for this condition but only makes it worse . Only under exceptional circumstances is the atmosphere sufficiently " steady " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used to its fullest extent . Resolving power is another quality of the telescope that is very important to the astronomer . This is the ability of the telescope to separate objects close together . What to one telescope is only a bright spot may be revealed as a whole cluster of suns by a telescope of superior resolving power . Like light-grasp , resolving power depends upon the size of the aperture . Divide 4 " .56 by the aperture diameter ; this will give you the minimum distance , in seconds of arc , by which two stars can be separated . By this formula , the 200 ? inch telescope has a resolving power of 0 " .023 , which is actually less than the angular diameter of a few giant stars as measured by means of the interferometer . A telescope of such high resolving power can produce a sharp , clear image with a wealth of fine detail that is simply not seen with a smaller instrument . Human eyes tire quickly and deteriorate in efficiency as they grow fatigued . A photographic plate never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap it all , preserves a permanent record of everything it sees . Small wonder that astronomers are the world 's most zealous photographers ! They also have the world 's biggest cameras . // Either a reflector or a refractor can be turned into a camera simply by substituting a plateholder for the eyepiece . Neither , however , has a wide field of vision . The field of view of the 200 ? inch telescope , for instance , is about a quarter of the area of the full Moon . For most purposes , a small field does not matter , but for some it does . How is the astronomer going to photograph the entire sky if he has to be limited to ridiculous pinpoint areas ? A third type of telescope had to be originated to do sky mapping . Sometimes it is called the Schmidt telescope and sometimes the Schmidt camera , but what 's in a name ? It was invented in 1931 by Bernhardt Schmidt , a Swedish-German optician who emigrated to California . Call it either a telescope or a huge wide-angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of reflector . Schmidt went back to Newton 's spherical curvature , which , as we have seen , was abandoned by later telescope makers because all parts of a spherical mirror do not have the same focus . The genius of Bernhardt Schmidt overcame the old difficulty of spherical aberration by inserting a correcting lens as far in front of the focal point as the mirror lies behind it . ( It would mean a very long tube if the Schmidt telescope did not have a comparatively short focus . ) A sharp , clear image with high resolution is thrown onto a curved film in front of the mirror . A sky area as wide as the constellation of Orion ( over 20 ? ) can now be persuaded to sit for its portrait . The world 's largest Schmidt , on Mount Palomar , has a 48 ? inch aperture ( correcting lens ) and a 72 ? inch reflecting mirror . For seven years its time was devoted to photographing all of the sky accessible from Palomar . Photographs were taken in both red and blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnitude 21.1 , the red plates down to 20.0 . Each color required 879 plates , 14 by 14 inches . The 200 ? inch glass giant could no more do the Schmidt 's job than Emerson 's mountain could crack a nut . // RADIO ASTRONOMY If the telescope is the Big Eye , to what shall the radio telescope be likened ? The Big Ear ? In a way , yes , for radio astronomers can use their weird-looking equipment to listen to sounds that began as radio waves , some of which may have traveled as far as 270 million light-years . The first music to be heard from the spheres was mere noise . Karl Jansky , recently graduated radio engineer , was hired in 1931 by Bell Telephone Laboratories to find the causes of the static that was interfering with transatlantic and ship-to-shore radio communication . Jansky built an experimental aerial on a potato farm at Holmdel , New Jersey . It was a merry-go-round affair a hundred feet long , made of upright frames of brass pipes secured to a wooden scaffolding . Using this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ static producers such as local and remote thunderstorms , interference from power lines , radio transmitters and the like . What puzzled him was a very faint hissing noise . The hisses seemed to be coming from a point outside Earth 's atmosphere . Daily that point rose in the east and moved across the sky to set in the west near the Sun . Jansky thought at first that the hisser was the Sun . Soon he realized that could n't be ; the source of the hisses was getting farther and farther ahead of the Sun . He kept daily records . The source rose four minutes earlier every day , gaining two hours a month . In a year it was back to the same position as the Sun . You and I know ( Chapter 5 ) that the fixed stars also rise four minutes earlier every day . Jansky did n't know . He took up the study of astronomy , and at once the truth dawned upon him . The extraterrestrial hissing was turning with the celestial sphere . He pinned it down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is located in this constellation , Jansky surmised that the puzzling noises were coming from the sun-packed heart of our Galaxy . If so , here was something truly remarkable , for the center of our Galaxy has never been penetrated by visual telescopes . // Dramatic announcement of the new discovery was made over a nationwide network by American Telephone and Telegraph Company in May , 1933 . The radio audience was given the opportunity to listen to the hisses from the stars , as picked up at Holmdel , fifty miles southwest of New York City . Shortly after this event , Jansky was assigned to other duties and abandoned radio astronomy . But a second and more enthusiastic pioneer soon caught up the torch . Grote Reber , of Wheaton , Illinois , astounded his neighbors in the summer of 1937 by building a strange contrivance in his back yard . It resembled a metal plate on top of the wooden skeleton of a bowl except for size : the plate measured 31 feet 5 inches in diameter . Reber constructed it by fitting together sections snipped from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tipped to point like a telescope to different areas of the sky . To anyone who would listen to him , Reber explained that it was a circular reflector of radio waves . It cost the inventor $2,000 in cold cash , besides much hard labor , but it yielded remarkable results . Reber confirmed Jansky 's discovery of the radio waves emanating from Sagittarius . He found other , more powerful sources in Cassiopeia and in Cygnus . He detected many " radio stars " that did not emit visible light , and he failed dismally to pick up radio signals from any of the brightest stars . For seven lean years he fought almost singlehanded to keep the flame of radio astronomy from flickering out . After recognition had come from official circles , he built an improved radio telescope located ? of all places ? on the 10,000-foot cone of Haleakala , an extinct volcano on the Hawaiian island of Maui . Space does not permit a more detailed account . The stories of Reber and Jansky are fully and interestingly told by John Pfeiffer . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengths are less than one ten-thousandth of a centimeter whereas radio wave lengths are centimeters and meters . It is next to impossible to obtain any precision in location or in separating close objects when working with such clumsily long waves . With an antenna // spread on the order of Earth 's diameter , a radio telescope receiving at 1 ? meter wave length might just be able to match the resolving power of the 200 ? inch telescope . Even though they know that in this respect they are hopelessly outclassed , radio astronomers are doing their best , and their best is fantastic . " Man , " wrote Thomas Carlyle , " is a tool-using animal . Nowhere do you find him without tools ; without tools he is nothing , but with tools he is all . " The Victorian savant could scarcely have visualized the weird and wonderful tools human brains could devise to improve radio reception from the heavens . One such tool is the huge sheet-metal reflector at the Jodrell Bank Experimental Station , University of Manchester , England . Compared to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " Big Dish " is 250 feet in diameter , much larger than the dome of our national Capitol , which is only 135 feet 5 inches across . The massive bowl , weighing several hundred tons , is pivoted on two traveling towers , which roll along a circular track . The gigantic antenna can be carried clear around the horizon , or it can be tilted to any angle from horizon to zenith . The rack-and-gear mechanism that does the tilting came from a British battleship . The Dish works much like the mirror of a reflecting telescope . The focal point is the tip of a 60 ? foot ? long metal rod or " dipole , " which sticks out from the center like the pistil of a flower . The radio waves that hit any part of the bowl are reflected to this tip . Amplified , the faint signals from interstellar space are fed to an automatic pen that records on moving chart paper . From the jagged line of peaks and valleys , the expert is able to interpret the radio language of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States has lagged behind Great Britain , Australia and even little Holland in radio telescopes . At present writing , we have nothing to match the Big Dish or the 82 ? foot parabolic antenna of the University of Leiden in the Netherlands . However , we are now about to catch up . Not quite in the Jodrell Bank class yet , a 140 ? foot dish antenna , financed by the National Science Foundation , will soon be under // construction near Green Bank , West Virginia . This mountain valley was selected for its freedom from major weather disturbances . An amazing low-temperature accessory , now under development , is expected to increase the receiving power of this new antenna and other radio telescopes by 100 times , allowing a 10-times-farther reach into space . A pair of 90 ? foot parabaloids in the Owens Valley , just east of the Sierra Nevada mountains near Big Pine , California , will probably be picking up space signals by the time this book comes out . Three hundred acres of land were leased through the Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financed by the Office of Naval Research . The twin reflector antennas are being constructed by the California Institute of Technology , one of the comanagers of Mount Wilson and Palomar , which has gained valuable test data with a pilot 32 ? foot reflector at Palomar Observatory . The new 40 ? ton antennas are to be mounted on railroad flatcars . The 1,600 ? foot rail lines intersect at right angles , allowing the cars to travel north-south and east-west courses . The movable antennas can he operated individually or separated to work together as an " interferometer , " in which latter case positional accuracy will be vastly improved . Radio stars may be pinpointed to within one or two tenths of a minute of arc . The Navy is also building an 84 ? foot aluminum dish near Riverside , Maryland . The southern Maryland site was chosen because of its low radio interference and clear view of the horizon . The radio telescope , designed by the D. S. Kennedy Company , Cohasset , Massachusetts , will be equatorially mounted on a steel tower to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At present writing , our largest radio telescope is 60 feet in diameter . This is at the George R. Agassiz Observatory , Harvard University , 30 miles from Cambridge . Nearly as big as the Harvard dish , the 50 ? foot parabolic reflector of the United States Naval Research Laboratory , Washington , D. C. approaches an optical mirror in perfection of craftsmanship . The curvature of the cast // aluminum bowl is accurate to ' /i of an inch . Very short waves of one centimeter and less , difficult to detect with less sensitive equipment , can be picked up for amplification . Other world centers of radio astronomy are : Cavendish Laboratory , Cambridge University , England ; Radiophysics Laboratory , Sydney , Australia ; Department of Terrestrial Magnetism , Carnegie Institution , Washington , D. C. , and Ohio State University , Columbus , Ohio . In Australia , vast ingenuity has been expended in the building of radio telescopes . For one L-shaped radio interferometer , an array of 64 parabolic reflectors was lined up . The interferometer principle requires explanation . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , separated from each other by considerable distance . The crest of a wave may arrive at both antennas simultaneously , in which case the signal will be double the strength of a signal from a single antenna . Again , the crest of a wave may arrive at one antenna while the trough of a wave is hitting the other , in which case trough and crest will cancel each other and there will be no signal . Much can be learned about the source of the waves from the pattern of reception . The interferometer also increases resolving power as the space is increased between the antennas . One Australian interferometer has aerials nearly ten miles apart . Another Australian interferometer has only one aerial , but it is on top of a 250 ? foot cliff overlooking the sea . The interferometer effect is obtained by comparing waves that come in directly with those received after bouncing off the surface of the ocean . The radio telescope built by Grote Reber on top of Haleakala is an interferometer of this type . The reflecting bowl is by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many technicians favor what they call the " flat array of dipoles . " Bernard Y. Mills , of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization , Australia , built an array of dipoles 1,500 feet long on flat ground near Sydney . The 600 dipoles , each an individual antenna , surmount a horizontal level of chicken wire , which is carried several feet above ground by // wooden beams . The chicken wire functions like the bowl of the dish type ; that is , it reflects the radio waves to the many dipoles . The resolving power of the chicken-wire telescope was greatly improved by a second array of dipoles , erected at right angles to form a 1,500-foot equal-armed cross . Naturally , this is called the Southern Cross . The Carnegie Institution 's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism has constructed a similar but larger cross near Washington , D. C. Switching to Canada , we find a third type of aerial that more nearly resembles a pig trough . This horizontal wave trap , built by the National Research Council , Ottawa , is 150 feet long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flat strips of chicken wire or the many parabolic bowls , the trough does not reflect the waves . Instead , the radio energy collected is directed through slots into a pipe ( waveguide ) and hence to the receiver . Harold 1 . Ewen , postgraduate student at Harvard University , constructed a wave-gathering horn , shaped like an inverted pyramid or a big funnel . In 1951 this enlarged ear trumpet selectively snared 21-centimeter waves from interstellar hydrogen , a historic landmark in radio astronomy . A Dutch astronomer , Hendrik C. van de Hulst , had predicted 21 ? centimeter radiation in 1944 . Different from any of the above-mentioned devices is the helical antenna of Ohio State University . This has 96 stretched-out coils of wire ( helices ) , which are said to be as effective as about a thousand dipoles . Each helix is 10 feet high , and the whole array is mounted upon a tiltable framework 160 feet long by 22 feet wide . I do n't know whether it has been nicknamed the Bedspring or not , but that is exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in late 1953 , was immediately put to work to construct a map of the radio heavens as seen at a wave length of 1.2 meters . This task paralleled the job of sky photography done by the Schmidt camera on Palomar mountain , but the two maps turned out to be entirely different . It does n't look like the same Universe ! There is still a Milky Way , though . Pinpointing of the galactic nucleus is one of the big achievements of radio astronomy . Light-years of interstellar dust prevent any optical telescope from reaching the center of our Galaxy , but // radio waves slash right through these dust clouds to bring us important information from galactic headquarters . For your address book , the galactic nucleus may be reached c/o Sagittarius at right ascension 17h 42m 483 , declination - 28 ? 50 ' . The source has a flux density of 25 X 10 ? " janskys . One jansky ( guess where that name came from ) is equivalent to one watt per square meter per cycle per second . A prodigious amount of energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extragalactic space . Some of the sources are said to be " trillions of quadrillions of times more powerful " than all Earthly broadcasting stations put together . Even astronomers , blase as they are about big numbers , were startled by the magnitude of the source termed Cygnus A. Could Earth collect and store just a single second of the total energy being radiated by Cygnus A , our planet 's entire heat and power needs for the next trillion years would be taken care of . This tremendous outburst is being caused by nothing less than two galaxies , which are engaged in a head-on collision 270 million light-years away . Optically , the dual victims of the extragalactic traffic disaster are so faint ( eighteenth magnitude ) it took the 200 ? inch telescope to photograph them . On the radio sky map , however , Cygnus A appears as the second brightest object . The strongest source is Cassiopeia A , " Cass " for short , at right ascension 23h 21m.2 , declination +58 ? .5 . Cass is not radiating anything like the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilowatts , whereas that of the colliding Cygnus galaxies is 103 kilowatts . But Cass is only 10,000 light-years away , not hundreds of millions . What causes it is not known , but a turbulent nebula , cubic light-years in volume , has been photographed at its sky location . Another intense source of radio waves known as Taurus A is at the location of the Crab Nebula , 3,300 light-years away . The nebula from which the radio waves are apparently coming is believed to be the expanding shell of gas created by a nova recorded by Chinese stargazers in 1054 . Taurus A is an exception to a rather general rule . Radio stars usually can not be identified with optical objects or , when they // can , only with very faint ones . If the stars of our night sky are not responsible for the broadcasts being picked up by the various bowls and helices and horns and dipoles , then what is ? " Complete answers must await the use of larger and better radio telescopes , " states one authority .

One of the common s whom the Lord must love because he made so many of tl Nevertheless , our Sun is worth a little study . Being the nearest and the only one with an observable disk , a great deal is kn a bout him ? far more than about any other star . The Sun also has his secrets and has even managed to keep s of them ? up to now . A good portrait painter will look at his subject from vat angles before he touches brush to canvas . That 's how we 're g to treat the Sun . We ca n't move in any closer physically , bui can shift mental angles .

Gilbert : The Mikado. 183 // ( 3 ) An astronomer , ( 4 ) A radio astronomer , ( 5 ) An astrophysicist . This varied collection of viewpoints ought to give us at least as good a portrait of the Sun as the five blind men had of the elephant after they had compared and digested their individual experiences . FIRST THE GALACTIC OBSERVER What impresses us above all else about the Sun is its brightness . All the stars together with the full Moon thrown in for good measure ca n't hold a candle to it . We calculated ( page 98 ) that the Sun is over 120 billion times as bright as a star of exactly the first magnitude . That 's how it looks to us . Not to our galactic observer . This citizen of the Galactic Empire , who has traveled far and seen everything , claims that the reason the Sun seems so bright to us is that it 's only 93,000,000 miles away . We must play fair , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all be at the same distance . So we line up the Sun with the others at the standard distance of 32.6 light-years . And what happens ? You know the answer . The Sun 's absolute magnitude is 4.84 . Yes , it can be seen without a telescope , but you must be careful to pick a clear , cloudless night , preferably one with the Moon not shining . By galactic standards , the Sun is a dull star . In his infuriatingly condescending fashion , the galactic observer advises us to look at Rigel in Orion . Rigel , 500 light-years away , has an apparent magnitude of 0.3 . Its absolute magnitude is - 5.6 . Moved up to the standard ten parsecs , Rigel would outshine all the stars and all the planets . It has 15,560 times the candle power of the Sun . In temperature , our Sun is n't in the same league with those really hot B stars in the Pleiades and Orion 's sword . It 's barely more than half the temperature of the Ao stars , Sirius and Vega @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , but only a yellow ball , as the galactic observer does n't hesitate to remind us . It 's hotter than red and orange stars Period . // As for size  --  " Your Sun is a dwarf , " sneers the galactic observer . He tells us of red supergiants in the constellations of Hercules and Auriga . One has 580 times , the other at least 2,000 times the diameter of the Sun . In mass , our local boy is not so badly outmatched , but it 's possible to find stars having up to ninety times the solar mass . To the galactic observer , our Sun is certainly nothing to brag about in any department . Since the Sun refuses to apologize for his shortcomings , we provincials in the galactic suburbs must bow our heads in shame . NEXT : THE SUN AT HOME At home an altogether different picture emerges . To the circling nine midges , their central orbit is overpowering . Even big Jupiter is a fleabite in comparison . As for tiny Earth The Sun 's diameter is 864,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Sun 's surface is 11,881 times Earth 's surface . The Sun 's volume is 1,295,029 times Earth 's volume . Over a million and a quarter Earths could be packed into a space the volume of the Sun , though not if they persisted in remaining hard little marbles . How 's your imagination this morning ? Can you imagine an Earth shrunk to a ball 48 ? feet in diameter ? Can you see the oceans and continents outlined on the 50 ? foot ball ? All right . On the same scale , the Sun is a great blazing ball a mile in diameter . And it 's farther away from 481 ? foot Earth than New York is from Philadelphia . Since supposing costs nothing , let 's suppose we have a sealed and heatproof train that is able to bore through the interior of the Sun like a worm through an apple . Tunneling to the center of the Sun and out to the opposite side , our Sun-boring train is able to travel a constant 50 miles an hour and keep it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will take 720 days to go through the Sun . To circumnavigate the solar equator at the same speed will require 2,262 days ? six years , two months and ten days . Our train could go around Earth 's piddling equator in 21 days . // The Sun weighs 746 times as much as all the planets put together . It weighs 333,434 times as much as Earth , and Earth 's weight is the gigantic number of 6.6 sextillion tons . The Sun 's weight is 2,200 million , million , million , million tons . Just for comparison , I 'll write that number in two ways : **37;476;TOOLONG tons 2.2 X 1027 tons Despite its tremendous mass , the Sun 's over-all density is not very impressive by Earthly standards . An average cubic yard of solar material weighs 1 ' /s tons ? less than the density of the lightweight metal magnesium . At its surface , the Sun is probably not as dense as air , and we have to descend about halfway to the center before we reach the density of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . It is estimated to be more than 75 times the density of water , or about seven times the density of lead ( 11.34 ) , and between three and four times the density of the rare metal osmium ( 22.48 ) . Osmium is the heaviest substance per unit volume to be found on Earth . What kind of strange substance can the Sun 's core be ? A superdense metal like osmium ? It is not . Strange as the thought may seem to you , the Sun 's tightly packed center is nothing but gas . You and I ca n't visualize a gas that is 75 times as dense as water ' ? and far more dense than any known solid substance ? but our limited terrestrial experience counts for nothing . To the scientist , a gas is a physical state in which matter can be compressed . The Sun 's core material , being readily compressible , rates as a " perfect " gas . The weird substance at the center of the Sun is not , however , like gases as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are stripped off their outer electron shells , which allows the nuclei to pack closely together and conform in every respect to the laws that govern the behavior of perfect gases . Some of these laws have to do with pressure . If you ever had to pump up a tire , you learned the hard way that a compressed gas exerts pressure to resist further compression . Even the air we are now breathing exerts pressure because of the weight of the overlying air ? at sea level it amounts to 14.7 pounds per square inch . // This , 14.7 " psi , " as engineers like to abbreviate it , is called the pressure of one atmosphere . The pressure of the compressed gas at the center of the Sun is said to be on the order of 100 billion atmospheres . My imagination boggles . Another pressure to be found inside the Sun is the pressure that light can exert at very high temperatures . We computed ( page 115 ) that at the Sun 's central temperature the radiation pressure is something like 12,800,000 tons per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order of a billion tons per square inch . But we are trespassing on the domain of the astrophysicist , who is not yet scheduled to talk . THE ASTRONOMER HAS HIS INNINGS By patient observations of solar markings ( which study began with Galileo ) , the astronomer has learned that the Sun rotates on its axis from west to east . In this respect it resembles Earth , but it takes the Sun nearly a month to turn its enormous bulk around . There are other important differences between solar and Earthly rotation . The Sun reveals the fact that it is not a solid body by spinning faster at the equator than elsewhere . At the equator , the solar day is equivalent to 25 of our days ; in solar latitude 75 ? , to 33 Earth days . This unequal rotation can be explained only by saying that parts of the Sun 's surface must be continually slipping past other parts . No solid planet could possibly rotate in this manner , but a ball of blazing gas can do it without difficulty . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ecliptic is 23 ? ? . The Sun 's equator is inclined only 7 ? to the plane of the ecliptic . The solar equator and the orbit of little Mercury are tilted to the ecliptic by the same 7 ? . The only orbit to have this particular tilt is that of the planet nearest to the Sun . I do n't know whether or not there is any connection , but it is worth mentioning . Dr. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin gives this vivid and beautiful word picture of the Sun 's surface : 1 // The sun 's steady output suggests tranquility , but its surface is far from quiescent . Dark spots on it are often visible to the naked eye , and a completely unspotted sun is extremely rare . Closer scrutiny reveals a continually changing fine granulation over the entire disk . The sun 's face is not a smooth unruffled sea of gas , but a heaving , churning expanse , with whirling tornadoes ( sunspots ) that break through from below , tongues of gas ( spicules ) that surge up and subside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swirl and erupt high above the surface and sudden localized blazes of intensely brilliant radiation ( flares ) . . . . The whole surface of the sun ? flares , granulations , even sunspots ? glows with intense brilliance . The granulations were described by the astronomer Secchi as " grains of rice bubbling in a milky fluid . " They are interpreted as being bubbles of gas , each bubble about 700 miles across . Besides these pustules , the Sun often suffers from a major skin disease . The blots on its complexion are vast , whirling abysses , tens of thousands of miles across . The largest sunspots could swallow a hundred planets like ours . Equipped with only a 2-inch telescope , a German amateur astronomer named Schwabe found out over a century ago that the number of sunspots is periodic . Average over-all cycle length is 11 years from minimum to minimum , but the period has varied , and may now be closer to 10 years than 11 . Last maximum was in 1947 at this writing . The 1947 cycle , incidentally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the poles and the Sun 's equator . They are never found closer to the equator than 5 ? nor farther away from it than solar latitude 45 ? . The majority of spots are between latitudes 5 ? and 30 ? , both north and south . A cycle of spots begins at farthest distances from the equator , and the blighted area gradually moves in centrally , squeezing the Sun 's equator from both sides . What causes the spots to halt within 5 ? of the equator ? One of the Sun 's secrets . Astronomers are not entirely sure what is causing sunspots . A theory that seems promising is that of magnetic interference with heated gas as it is rising to the surface by convection . Convection is the transfer of heat by moving masses of fluid ; for example , // currents in gases caused by differences in temperature and density . A strong magnetic field , it is conjectured , will interfere with this heat-transfer process and so give rise to a cool island on the Sun 's blazing ocean . The strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intensity of magnetic field is called the gauss ( pronounced to rhyme with mouse ) . Earth 's magnetic field , though strong enough to keep all compass needles aligned north and south , amounts to no more than a fraction of one gauss . In striking contrast , the magnetic field of a sunspot is on the order of several thousand gauss . With magnetism that powerful , anything may happen . If solar magnetic fields do hinder convection , then the heat that is stopped from flowing up through a sunspot should leak out around it . Hence the area surrounding a spot should be brighter than other portions of the solar surface . Observations have shown this to be true . Now the only question to be answered is : " What causes the magnetic fields ? " Solar prominences are sometimes associated with sunspots , sometimes not . A prominence is a scarlet cloud of gas floating high above the Sun 's surface . It is of the same order of size as a sunspot . A " typical " prominence is said to be 125,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The all-time height record was established June 4 , 1946 , by a prominence that soared upward for 1,050,000 miles . It is said to have been traveling 400,000 miles an hour . Impossible to comprehend such things . The great flame clouds may assume the shapes of pillars , trees , haystacks , funnels , loops of ribbon , feathers , fountains , even the giant reptiles of the Age of Dinosaurs . They may erupt like volcanoes or spout up like geysers . More often it 's the other way around , and the prominences are sucked downward to fall upon the Sun 's surface like rain . As revealed by colored motion pictures , they are both beautiful and terrifying . Spicules and flares are other attributes of the Sun mentioned by Dr. Payne-Gaposchkin . Spicules are slender needles of flame shooting out at speeds of approximately 20 miles a second . They have brief lives , seldom lasting more than five minutes . Unlike sunspots , spicules are most abundant near the poles . // Flares are more interesting . A flare resembles a prominence iii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise it 's entirely different . An area will suddenly blaze up , reaching a peak of brightness within a few minutes , and then fade out more gradually , taking perhaps as long as an hour to die away . Flares directly concern us because they are able to cause bad radio disturbances here and produce beautiful auroral displays . It takes 26 hours for the full effects of a flare to reach Earth 's atmosphere , 93,000,000 miles from the point of origin . Four out of every five flares are accompanied by outbursts of radio waves . Causes of these outbreaks of solar bad temper are not known , but flares seem to be associated with sunspots and are particularly noticeable when a large new group of spots is growing active . The Sun has three atmospheres , and the onionlike structure is apt to confuse the layman . Below the three peelings , corresponding to " surface " on Earth , is the photosphere , which is what you will see when you view the Sun through smoked glass at any time except total eclipse . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunspots are found , also bright spots called faculae , meaning little torches . Above the " heaving , churning expanse " are the atmospheres : reversing layer , chromosphere and corona . Closest to the Sun , the reversing layer was given its name because of what it does to the solar spectrum . Bright lines of the luminous photosphere are blotted out and replaced by dark lines , as discussed in Chapters 7 and 12 . Since it takes a cooler gas to produce an absorption spectrum , temperature of the reversing layer must be less than that of the photosphere . This first atmosphere extends out from 100 to 200 miles . Second atmosphere , the chromosphere , carries on for several thousand miles . At total eclipse , it may be seen as a scarlet ring around the dark disk of the occulting Moon . It was given its name , derived from the Greek , chroma , because of its color . Flares and most prominences are found in the chromosphere . So are flocculi ? clouds of calcium or hydrogen vapor . These show up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their temperature . The calcium clouds are usually brighter ( hotter ) than their surroundings ; the hydrogen masses may be either bright or dark . // The pulsating corona is outermost and by far the largest of the three atmospheres . The name means crown , and a poet may think of a halo of pearly light . Shape of the crown is for some reason a good deal affected by sunspots . At sunspot maximum , corona streamers surround the disk as uniformly as petals of a daisy . Near a sunspot minimum , the crown goes askew and long , asymmetrical spikes stream out from the solar equator . I measured one in a photographic reproduction and found that it was 1 ? times the solar disk , giving it a length of about 1,300,000 miles . The corona is quite luminous . It actually emits about half as much light as the full Moon , yet the glare of sunlight drowns it completely , and its presence can be detected only during eclipse or by means of a special telescope , the coronagraph , that fakes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The inner corona , which produces most of the light , is yellowish , and the outer corona is pearly white . Until a few years ago , certain spectral lines in coronal light could n't be matched up with those of known elements . This caused consternation . Helium , you may remember , was found spectroscopically in the Sun before its discovery on Earth . Astronomers believed they had another new element and named it , appropriately , coronium . Coronium is now an exploded myth . The corona is composed of familiar calcium , iron and nickel , but of atoms from which 9 to 15 electrons have been brutally wrenched . This sort of atomic strip-teasing can go on only at extremely high temperatures ? much higher than those found on Earth or even on the surface of the Sun . RADIO ASTRONOMER SEES IT DIFFERENTLY The radio astronomer 's particular concern is with the outer solar atmospheres , which are responsible for most of the radio waves emitted from the Sun . To the radio astronomer , the Sun is always a dark disk surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views it only at total eclipse . With eyes that received and interpreted radio waves instead of light waves , the Sun would look to us like a ring with a black hole // in its center . Ring and hole together , the gigantic object would take up 400 times the present area of the Sun . Its diameter would be 10 degrees instead of the present lh degree . The radio Sun is not only bigger than the visual Sun , it is even bigger than the visual corona . Latest findings reveal the radius of the radio corona is 20 times the radius of the optical Sun . Perhaps the radio corona is even larger than the measured 8,640,000 miles . It has been theorized that it may even extend into Earth 's orbit and be responsible for the faint glow along the ecliptic called the zodiacal light . Verdict : not proven . The output of radio waves is anything but stable . According to John Pfeiffer : 2 The radio sun is a thing of flickering , pulsating radiations . During the day it may flare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times in violent , unexpected radio fits . On rarer occasions it has been known to grow hundreds of thousands of times brighter within a few seconds . In placid contrast , the output of sunlight is remarkably constant . Sunspots , to which practically everything else has been attributed , are now asked to take the blame for radio waves . Mrs. Leona Marshall , a physicist of the University of Chicago , suggests that spiraling electrons shooting out from sunspots may be forming shock waves . These shock waves , she conjectures , are the cause of the Sun 's radio clatter . " HOW LONG ? " ASKS THE ASTROPHYSICIST The astrophysicist 's primary interests are what makes the Sun tick and for how long is it likely to go on ticking . To solve these problems , he must know : ( 1 ) the temperature of the Sun and ( 2 ) the rate of energy radiation . There are three classic methods by which the Sun 's surface temperature may be calculated , and they agree fairly well . Recently , Dr. Joel Stebbins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still another method . ' Aided by a new device that is able to // reduce sunlight " to scale " without changing its quality , and a photoelectric cell , they compared the sun 's light quantitatively with the output of a standard lamp and with an electric furnace at 3,000 K. The comparison revealed the Sun 's surface to be at 6,400 K , which is about 6,100 C and equivalent to 11,000 F. It is a bit higher than the temperature determined by the previous methods but is not at all out of line . Solar temperatures are far from uniform . The reversing layer is cooler than the photosphere , and sunspots are solar icebergs of about 4,000 C. Contrariwise , the chromosphere and the corona are both at elevated temperatures . The chromosphere is about 20,000 C and the corona ? hold your breath ! ? about 2,000,000 C. What makes the chromosphere and the corona so much hotter than the Sun 's surface ? The Sun wo n't talk . The interior of the Sun is at much higher temperature than even the corona . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the order of 100,000,000,000 atmospheres a very high temperature can result . The solar interior is estimated at from 15 , - 000,000 to 20,000,000 C , most authorities leaning toward the higher value . These figures are wholly meaningless . A quarter of a century ago , Sir James Jeans endeavored to put meaning into 20,000,000 C. A pinhead of matter at this temperature , he asserted , will emit heat enough to kill anyone who ventures within a hundred miles of it . A power plant rated at 100 million million horsepower will have to work full capacity to make good the energy the supersupersuperheated pinhead will be losing through radiation.4 Sir James made the above statements before the hydrogen bomb was conceived . Temperatures as high as the interior of the Sun are now being produced here on Earth with appalling regularity ; fortunately , for only small fractions of a second . The lethal potentialities would appear to be not far out of line from the theoretical predictions of the British astronomer . Less than two billionths of the Sun 's radiation reaches Earth , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // comfortable ( more or less ) living temperature . The rate of solar radiation is almost inconceivable . It has to be figured in tons of matter converted into energy ? 4,000,000 tons every second . If I may quote Sir James Jeans 5 again : " The total emission of radiation by the sun . . . is something like 10,000 times the average rate at which water flows under London Bridge . And , incidentally , if our factor of 10,000 is wrong , " adds Sir James , " it is not because we do not know the exact weight of solar radiation but because we do not know the average flow of the Thames with very great precision . " An American like me can better visualize the water pouring over Niagara Falls than the flow of the Thames River . So I pulled out the World Almanac from the bookcase , looked up a fact or two and did a little figuring . The tonnage of matter converted into energy every second by the Sun is equivalent to the flow of 600 Niagaras . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun is at least four billion years old . ' I have nothing with which to compare four billion years , but during every second of that time the Sun has been squandering four million tons of its substance . A cosmic spendthrift ! You think so ? I have news for you . In four billion years the Sun has parted with only 0.0253 per cent of its present capital . A cosmic tightwad ! If a pile of coal the size of the Sun had been set on fire near the beginning of written history , in the rule of Egypt 's first Pharaoh , the colossal bonfire would have burned out ages ago . But the Sun , four billion years old , is still going strong . What keeps it shining ? Twenty years ago that was one of the Sun 's best-kept secrets . Scientists of the highest rank had been trying for nearly a century to explain it and had failed dismally . Then one day in 1938 , a year when the antics of a certain Herr Hitler were grabbing the headlines , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Washington , where he had been attending a conference on theoretical physics . Instead of working a crossword puzzle , reading , // yawning or staring out of the window , Dr. Bethe decided to spend his traveling time in calculating the nuclear reactions that would fit the energy output of the Sun . He had his answer before the first call for dinner ; it was the six-stage atomic process called the carbon-nitrogen cycle or the solar phoenix . ' Leaving out important details , the sequence of atomic transmutations is from : ( 1 ) carbon to nitrogen , ( 2 ) nitrogen to carbon , ( 3 ) carbon to nitrogen , ( 4 ) nitrogen to oxygen , ( 5 ) oxygen to nitrogen and ( 6 ) nitrogen to the original carbon 12 plus helium . A hydrogen nucleus is absorbed at stages 1 , 3 , 4 and 6 , and energy is liberated at stages 1 , 3 and 4 . Bethe 's inspired mathematics exactly accounts for the liberation of that 4,000,000 tons of energy per second , and for many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun did derive its energy by this series of reactions . Now they are not so sure . The prevailing opinion seems to be that , while the carbon-nitrogen cycle probably does go on , it plays a subordinate role in the solar power plant . The process held most likely to keep the Sun in its present state of shining splendor is a chain of fusions called the proton-proton reaction . It is described simply by three equations : ( 1 ) 1H1 + 1H ' - 1H2 + e ( positive electron ) ( 2 ) 1H2 + 1H ' -4 2He3 + y ( gamma radiation ) ( 3 ) 2He3 + 2He3 -a 2He4 +21H1 The three equations say this : Equation I. At the central temperature of the Sun , protons or hydrogen nuclei , of atomic weight 1 , are moving so rapidly that when two of them collide they are able to fuse together . This makes something else . The new particle , called a deuteron , is of atomic weight 2 . In nuclear equations , all subscripts and superscripts have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the same electrical charge as the colliding protons , designated by the left subscripts . To keep the charge of the deuteron to 1 , a // positive electron has to wing off somewhere from the right-hand side . Nobody misses it . Equation 2 . Our deuteron , atomic weight 2 , fuses with a third proton , ordinary variety , to form helium of atomic weight 3 . All subscripts and superscripts balance . Helium 3 is an isotope called tralphium . Being helium , it has a positive charge , or atomic number , of 2 . What 's really important is that the fusion liberates energy in the form of short-wave gamma radiation . So does the hydrogen bomb . Equation 3 . Tralphium is a great snob and wo n't even speak to protons . It positively refuses to take one more of them into the fold . However , these supercilious tralphium nuclei will associate with each other . Two of them fuse to produce normal helium 4 , squeezing out two ordinary protons of atomic weight 1 . Drawing up a profit-and-loss statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclei that fused in Equation 3 . Two protons were recovered . Net loss : four hydrogen nuclei , which are locked up in a worthless helium 4 nucleus . If hydrogen is the solar fuel , and it is , then helium is certainly the dead ashes . ' We get the same answer from both the proton-proton reaction and Dr.Bethe 's more complicated carbon-nitrogen cycle : four hydrogen nuclei are taken for every new helium nucleus that comes into being . The loss of mass is about 0.7 per cent . To see what the last sentence means , we 'll suppose that the Sun started out in the star business four billion years ago as simon-pure hydrogen . We 'll suppose that it continues to burn its hydrogen for billions of years in the future . When the last atom of hydrogen has been converted into helium , the Sun will still have 99.3 per cent of its original mass of four billion years ago . No , it is n't a spendthrift . To account for its radiation , the Sun must convert 564,000,000 tons of hydrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of a different order of magnitude from 4,000,000 tons . Common sense whispers that no process on such a colossal scale can continue for long . Oh , ca n't it ? If you do n't mind a little arithmetic , we 'll find out how long the Sun can keep on shining . The 564,000,000 tons of hydrogen lost per second must first be multiplied by the number of seconds in a year , 31,557,000 . We do it the easy way : 5.64 X 108 3.16 X 10 ' 1.78 X 1016 The only multiplying is to the left . On the right we add the exponents of the 10 's . Yes , I know that 7 plus 8 makes 15 , not 16 ; we had to increase the exponent by 1 because 3 X 5 is more than 10. 1.78 X 1016 is a doggone big number , somewhere in the quadrillions . The Sun must have lots of hydrogen if it can afford to spare this number of tons every year . Brother , the Sun does have lots of hydrogen ! Just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . I tried looking it up in the textbooks , with a few newspapers and magazines thrown in , and here 's what they told me : " Mostly hydrogen . " " A hydrogen abundance of about one-third by weight . " " Eighty-five per cent hydrogen and fifteen per cent helium plus a bit of impurity . " " One-third of the total mass of our luminary is hydrogen . " " Mainly hydrogen . . . more atoms of hydrogen than of all other kinds put together . " " The percentage of hydrogen may be 33 or 99.5 . " " Seventy per cent of the Sun 's mass must be hydrogen . " " Only about 40% consists of hydrogen . " " Over 80% of the solar atmospheric atoms are hydrogen . " " About 59 per cent by weight of hydrogen . " " Hydrogen 47% by mass . " What 's a dumb cluck like me to believe ? These guys ca n't all he right . . . yes , in a sense they can . They agree perfectly on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one-third hydrogen . Let 's take this pessimistic view of the solar fuel supply and carry on from there . Sun 's mass = 2.186 X 1027 tons One-third = 7.29 X 1026 tons Now we have only to divide the estimated hydrogen in the Sun by the yearly tonnage loss . Very easy . 7.29 X 1026 1.78 X 1016 4.1 X 101 ? Forty-one billion years ! And this , mind you , on the assumption of the least amount of hydrogen estimated to be in the Sun . That 41 billion years is at least ten times as long as the Sun 's present age . On the human time scale , our luminary is a child between six and seven . Oh , to be so young ! Enter some Gloomy Guses . We are not going to have any long , dreamy 41 billion years to look forward to , they tell us dolefully . Trouble 's headed our way . A heat trap is being built up in the Sun . Let me try to explain what they mean . I once stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel down the production line . Each and every steel shell was wrapped with several inches of fiber glass . That insulating blanket prevents unwanted radiation . The boiler wo n't waste energy in raising the temperature of the boiler room . The engineer wo n't have to sweat and drink gallons of ice water . The boiler will hold its heat inside . Insulation is a very good thing for a boiler . But It 's all wrong for the Sun . Wrapped around the solar power plant there 's a blanket of insulation that acts much like the fiber glass around the boiler shell . That blanket is increasing by 560,000,000 more tons every second . Yes , helium . Helium absorbs several times more radiation than hydrogen does . The gamma rays being made in the solar // power plant will find it harder and harder to get to the surface where they can be radiated off into space . They are having a bad enough time as it is . Even under the present arrangement , their journey from the center of the Sun is estimated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time the long journey has been completed , the original gamma rays have been toned down to the sedate level of visible light . But in that lower form , the energy does get through and is radiated out into space as fast as the Sun can manufacture it . What would happen if it were to be trapped inside ? You do n't need to think twice about it . Yes , the Sun would grow hotter . The higher central temperature would stimulate more nuclear reactions and burn up hydrogen at a higher rate . This would augment the production of helium , to build up a thicker layer of insulation , to retain still more energy , to raise the temperature more , to stimulate more nuclear reactions , to ? well , you see what a vicious cycle we 're in . What the Sun badly needs is a built-in governor to shut down its output at the critical time , but that is one feature it does n't have . So it will go on stupidly using up more hydrogen when it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This ca n't go on forever . Sooner or later , the Sun will have to break through the heat trap and rid itself of its excess energy . When that happens , mankind will have to pay for placing its entire dependence upon a fickle star . All the ways in which the Sun may unload its energy surplus are from our point of view highly unpleasant . The Sun may break through the heat trap mildly , or it may break through it explosively . In the first case , it will increase its radiation . This will cool it off but heat up Earth . Not very much , perhaps ; maybe enough to bring our oceans to the boiling point . The Sun may then slump back to normal radiation , build up the heat trap and grow warm again inside . The remedy may be repeated over and over , which is how a variable star behaves . Should our steady , reliable Sun ever decide to imitate a variable star , we wo n't be here very long . Neither will any other living thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drastic // changes in the energy that a kindly providence is tempering to them . A change in the Sun of only one-half magnitude ? up or down ? is sufficient to wipe all life from our globe , according to Sir Harold Spencer Jones . ' And what 's half a magnitude to a variable star ? Instead of becoming a variable star ? or perhaps in addition to it ? our friendly purveyor of light and heat may turn nova and blow a. large chunk of itself out into space . Good-by , old Earth ! Hello , you new cloud of vapor ! Some stars do take this suicide 's way out . Their number is very small in comparison with the number of stars in the Galaxy , but the stars are now mostly quite young . Who can say that the suicide rate wo n't go up drastically as the stellar population approaches old age ? Whether the Sun becomes a variable star or a nova , or continues to shine on at the same steady rate ( the least likely possibility ) , eventually its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , possible only at enormously high temperature , the atomic furnace will have to shut down . When this happens and the Sun begins to cool off inside , look for another startling change to occur . At present the Sun is in a beautiful state of balance . Gas pressure and radiation pressure , both forces directed outwardly , are exactly balancing gravitation at every point within the Sun . How do we know ? Very simple . If the Sun were increasing in size , the outwardly directed forces would have the upper hand . If it were to grow smaller , gravitation would be winning the tug of war . Since neither is happening , the Sun stays its present size . But this balance will be destroyed as soon as the central temperature drops . Radiation pressure ? remember that fantastic 12,800,000 tons per square inch ? ? will fall off extremely rapidly because it varies with the fourth power of the absolute temperature . With radiation no longer able to hold up its end , the Sun will behave like a punctured tire . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same amount of matter will merely be jammed into a smaller ball . The atoms will pack // more closely together . Perhaps the Sun may wind up as one of those weird white dwarfs where a cubic inch of material weighs several tons . Yes , the Sun has a dismal future before it . But let 's not get panicky . The Sun , as we know it , will probably last out a few billion more years yet . Let 's hope so , anyway . That concludes my lecture on the Sun , but I see that some members of the audience have their hands up for questions . You , sir , in the front row ? " Do other stars have the same chemical elements as the Sun ? " The evidence is overwhelmingly in the affirmative . Hydrogen and helium are by far the most abundant atoms in the Universe . There is 10 times as much hydrogen as helium and over 100 times as much helium as oxygen , which is a poor third on the list . After oxygen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neon , magnesium , iron and sulphur , there being 350,000 times as much hydrogen as there is sulphur . All of these elements , and scarcer ones such as sodium , potassium , calcium , aluminum and others , are to be found both in the Sun and in the stars . We know of no element in the Sun that is not found in the stars nor of any element in the stars that is not to be found in the Sun ... Your question , sir ? " Do other stars have planets ? " That 's a good question , and I 'm sorry no one can answer it . The Galaxy may be teeming with planets , and we would never know about it . " Why not ? " Professor Lee , 1 ? of Northwestern University , proved it very convincingly for my money . He turned the thing around by postulating a planet in the Alpha Centauri system , which turned a 200 ? inch telescope to focus upon our Sun . They found no planets : all of our nine were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sun to be separated from it . So how can Earth hope to see Alpha Centauri 's planets ? Much less those of any other star ? . . . Your question ? // " I thought an invisible planet had been detected by the gravitational effect on the orbit of a double star . " True to a certain extent . In 1942 Dr. K. A. Strand , of Dearborn Observatory , deduced the presence of a third component , C , in the binary system of 61 Cygni from periodic variations in the positions of the visible stars . 61 Cygni C has never been seen or photographed . After 14 years of observation of the orbits of its companions , Dr. Strand determined its mass as eight times the mass of Jupiter . Do you call that a planet ? If you do , one has been detected . I have time for just one more question . " Even though we ca n't know definitely , what are the chances that other stars have planets ? " The chances depend a great deal on what theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nebular hypothesis of Laplace was gospel ? it lasted for about a century ? the spawning of planets was something that could and probably must happen to any star . But the nebular hypothesis fell into disfavor because it failed to account for observed facts , in particular for the slow speed at which the Sun rotates . Next came the planetesimal theory , proposed by T. C. Chamberlin and F. R. Moulton around 1900 . Sir James Jeans elaborated and developed it into the tidal theory in 1916 . We 'll skip the differences . Both theories are based upon the assumption that our planets were produced from matter torn out of the Sun by the close approach of another star . We have already learned ( Chapter 10 ) that if we scale down stars like our Sun to 2-foot diameter , a light-year will be about the distance between Boston and Los Angeles . When 2-foot balls are scattered the width of a continent apart , the chances are pretty slim that any two of them will come into close contact . The chances of a planetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was next door to mathematically impossible that even our own system could exist . Although the theorists had to admit we were here , they would not allow that many , if any , other stars could have planets . We were something unique in the Universe . That distinction has been taken away from us . The tidal theory has been replaced by the Weizsacker-Kuiper hypothesis , which is , // so far as I know , still the fair-haired boy of the theorists . This is somewhat modified Laplace . Aggregations of dust particles sweep up more and more dust as they revolve around the Sun until eventually a planet is born . This , again , is something that can happen to any star . Copulation between stars is no longer necessary ; virgin births are the prevailing rule . The rather long time that we 've been spending with the Sun is , I believe , fully justified . The Sun is not an isolated example but a typical star . As the Sun goes , so goes the Galaxy . And for all we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 SHOWPIECES OF THE SKY They are all fire and every one doth shine. * Stars have personalities just as people do . Their leading socialites will be found listed in the table on the next page . Let 's get better acquainted with these members of the Social Register . The table presents condensed dossiers for the 22 brightest stars in the sky . The column headings of magnitude , absolute magnitude , luminosity , distance , parallax , proper motion , diameter , mass , spectral class and color should require no explanation . We ought to know by now how astronomers obtain this sort of information . Compiler 's note : The values for magnitude , distance and parallax were taken from the 1957 Star Tables of The World Almanac and Book of Facts , published annually by the New York WorldTelegram and The Sun . Absolute magnitude and luminosity were computed by the formulas given in Chapter 6 . The information in the remaining columns was gleaned from whatever sources the 204 // compiler could find , and many authorities were consulted and weighed against each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mass and diameter columns . Your compiler is sorry . // Our 22 star dossiers are arranged in order of brilliance ( apparent magnitude ) . Most of these stars are visible in the northern hemisphere at latitude 40 ? north , but six are not . You will have to travel southward if you wish to see Canopus , Alpha Centauri , Achernar , Beta Centauri , Alpha Crucis and Beta Crucis . If any excuse for a Florida vacation is needed , all six should be visible from Key West or even Miami at some time of year , though never rising high above the horizon . 1 . SIRIUS The three stars of Orion 's sword belt point directly to Sirius . You ca n't fail to recognize the " sparkling one , " the most brilliant of all stars . Alpha Canis Majoris owes its brightness , magnitude - 1.6 , mainly but not altogether to its close distance of 8.6 light-years . Size and temperature likewise play a part in making this star so shining . Sirius has a surface temperature of 10,300 C , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient as a radiator of light . A beautiful white star , shading into blue , it belongs in spectral class Ao . It is about twice the Sun 's diameter , 2.4 times its mass and 26 times as luminous . Being very close to us , Sirius shows a large proper motion . Its position changes every year by 1 " .32 , which converts into a tangential velocity of 10i miles a second . Line-of-sight velocity is 5 miles a second . At this slow speed , Sirius is coming our way . Sirius is a double system . Sirius A , the main component , is 2.4 times the Sun 's mass , and Sirius B , the companion , is 1.1 times the Sun 's mass . The odd thing about the companion is that it is only one thirty-seventh the diameter of the Sun . It must , therefore , have an enormously high over-all density . The Pup , as the companion is affectionately known to astronomers , was the first white dwarf to be detected . It was discovered in 1862 by George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he was testing the 18 ? ? inch lens that was diverted from Mississippi to Illinois . // 2 . CANOPUS Though a southern star ( declination - 52 ? 40 ' ) , Alpha Carinae was well known to the peoples of antiquity . It was named by the Greeks , either after a hero of Homer or an Egyptian city . It is the second brightest star in the sky and the only one besides Sirius to have a negative magnitude , - 0.9 . Its absolute magnitude of - 4.2 is exceeded only by that of Rigel of the stars on our list . As we calculated in Chapter 6 , Canopus is 4,200 times as luminous as the Sun . It is yellow-white in color and belongs to spectral class Fo , intermediate in temperature between the Sun and Sirius . The table gives the distance of Canopus as 150 light-years . It was once believed to be 650 light-years away , at which distance its luminosity and size would both have to be truly enormous to account for the high apparent brightness . If it were at 650 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Sun and 180 times its size , up among the supergiants . At a mere 150 light-years , its diameter is probably no more than 40 times the Sun 's , which still leaves it a good-sized giant . 3 . VEGA Alpha Lyrae ties with Alpha Centauri for third place in the sky . In absolute magnitude , there is no comparison . Vega is much , much brighter than Alpha Centauri and is even brighter than Sirius , a star it resembles in many ways . Vega is about 55 times as luminous as the Sun and about 2 ? times the Sun 's diameter . Vega and Sirius have the same spectral classification , Ao , so their surface temperature must be the same , around 10,300 C. Both are bluish-white stars . Considering its close distance of 27 light-years , the proper motion of Vega is low , only 0 " .35 annually . Its transverse velocity is about 8 ? miles per second of time , and its radial velocity is also 8 ? miles a second . Vega is coming toward us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 12 miles per second , but even at the // combined velocities , it will take 245,000 years to bring the Sun and Vega to the point of closest approach . Vega is almost due west of the center star of the Northern Cross . 4 . ALPHA CENTAURI Though exceeded in apparent brilliance only by Sirius and Canopus , Alpha of the Centaur has never been given a proper name . Its bright sky companion Beta Centauri was equally ignored by the Greeks and Arabs . Possibly these stars were unknown to the astronomers of classical times . Both of them are far south ? Alpha has a declination of - 60 ? 40 ' and Beta a declination of - 60 ? 10 ' . Alpha Centauri is a multiple star system , but one more complicated than that of Sirius . There are three components : Alpha Centauri A , Alpha Centauri B and Proxima Centauri . Proxima Centauri , as its name implies , is our closest stellar neighbor . It is only 4.16 light-years away and has the largest parallax measured : 0 " .783 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 0 " .761 . When the intrepid space voyagers described in science fiction succeed in reaching the nearest star , here is what they will find awaiting them : Alpha Centauri A is a Go star , like the Sun , and also close to the Sun in mass and diameter . Alpha Centauri B is a K5 , an orange star like Arcturus and Aldebaran , about equal to the Sun in diameter and with about 0.9 of the Sun 's mass . Proxima Centauri is an altogether different sort of apple . It is a cool M5 star , about onetwentieth of the Sun 's diameter but with only 0.00005 its luminosity . A dwarf , obviously , but a different breed from others we have met ; call it a red dwarf . Proxima Centauri travels in so large an orbit that astronomers have not been able to establish its period and so have not been able to weigh this star . However , they are certain that it is a true member of the Alpha Centauri system because all three stars are moving together at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both have the same magnitude , 0.2 . Somehow Arcturus edged into the table ahead of Capella so we 'll let it stay there . Arcturus is 33 light-years away , which is so close to the standard distance of ten parsecs that its absolute and apparent magnitudes are the same . A true giant in size , Arcturus has 24 times the diameter and 4 times the mass of the Sun , its mass being inferred from spectral peculiarities . It is an orange star with a Ko spectrum . Its surface temperature is about 3,725 C , so it is not so efficient a radiator as our Sun . Though its surface is 576 times as great , it is only 72 times as luminous . However , you never have any trouble seeing Arcturus in the sky . Name was derived from the Greek arktos , a bear , because of its supposed duty of keeping the Great Bear turning around in the sky . Probably the most interesting thing about Arcturus is its large annual proper motion . Traveling at 67 ? miles a second , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " high velocity " or " Population II " stars that do not share the general rotational movement of the Galaxy . Dr. Payne-Gaposchkin refers to them as " jaywalkers in the stellar traffic lanes . " To find Arcturus , continue the curve of the handle of the Big Dipper away from the bowl . 6 . CAPELLA The Little She Goat turns out to be a pair of twins , each about 16 times the diameter of the Sun . One has a mass of 4.2 times the Sun , the other a mass of 3.3 times the Sun . Both are Go stars like the Sun . Yellow giants like these Capella twins are relatively rare . Capella is to be found in the constellation of Auriga at 5h 13.5 ? ' and +45 ? 57 ' . It should be an interesting object for the amateur astronomer . It is about on the same hour line as Rigel but far to the north . // 7 . RIGEL Rigel is the southwest corner of the Orion quadrangle , diagonally opposite Betelgeuse . Beta Orionis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alpha star of Orion , but is at the top of our list in absolute magnitude , - 5.6 , as computed upon a distance of 500 light-years . It is at least 15,560 times as luminous as the Sun . Rigel may be even farther than 500 light-years away and if so is correspondingly more luminous . Latest information I have would put it 650 light-years away and increase luminosity to 23,000 or perhaps even 50,000 times that of the Sun . Rigel has a B8 spectrum , and its surface temperature is estimated at over 12,000 C. Its diameter is about 35 times the Sun 's diameter , and its mass may be 33 times the solar mass . Certainly Rigel belongs among the giants , but its combination of high temperature and big size is something quite different from other giants we have met . We shall have to call it a " blue giant . " These are relatively rare in our corner of the Galaxy . Rigel is the only one of the 22 entries to qualify . 8 . PROCYON Procyon is nearly due east of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Social Register mainly because it is close , only 10 light-years away . Alpha Canis Minoris is another multiple star system . The main star has a mass slightly more than the Sun but is about twice as big . It is yellowish-white and has an F5 classification , which means it beats the Sun in surface temperature . Higher temperature plus larger size combine to give Procyon A about five times the Sun 's candle power . The companion of Procyon is comparable in diameter to the little planet Mercury . As you might expect , it is very faint ? only 0.0005 the luminosity of the Sun , which is still brighter than Proxima Centauri . Its high mass , 0.6 that of the Sun , makes this star look like another white dwarf . The transverse velocity of Procyon is nearly 12 miles a second , and it is approaching us at 2 ? miles a second .
