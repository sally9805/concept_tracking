For seasoned readers of the Chicago Tribune ( circ. 877,636 ) the announcement on the editorial page last week was something of a shocker . Under the headline NEW DEPARTMENT , the Trib said matter-of-factly : " That its readers may have the benefit of other views in judging issues of national and international policy , the Tribune is instituting a department on this page designated ' The Other Side , ' reprinting editorials from other newspapers which generally reject judgments sharply opposed to our own . " <P> Readers were understandably surprised since the Trib customarily brooks no " internationalist , " " pro-Eisenhower " or " leftwing " nonsense in its pages . For 30 years , the paper has faithfully expressed the views of its eccentric publisher , Colonel Robert R. McCormick . It still runs no syndicated political columnists because there are none whose views would fit day to day with the views of the colonel . But last week , to prove that it meant what it said , the Trib ran a series of editorials from such sources as the Fair Dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manchester Guardian . <P> Changing Times . Is the Trib changing its ways ? There were signs that it is . Recently the paper printed an editorial saying that its longtime hero Joe McCarthy had begun to " irritate " too many people . Even the paper 's front-page cartoons , which often showed a runty , Ike-faced figure , idly playing golf while bigger tasks went undone in the background , have been replaced by nonpolitical cartoons . More and more readers detect a hint of reasonableness in Trib editorials for some of the opinions of the other side . Apart from politics , the colonel has ordered dry-runs on a gossip column for the Trib , although in the past he has scorned such things as the work of " keyhole peepers . " <P> Changing Circulation . The changes are all the colonel 's doings . In his Tribune Tower office , the colonel has learned from the business office figures that the methods that made the paper successful are no longer working as well . Circulation has dropped almost 20% since 1946 ( although a big circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while John Knight 's Daily News has steadily gained , and Marshall Field 's Sun-Times has edged into the black . <P> Old ( 73 ) and ailing , the colonel was so busy with the Washington Times-Herald , until he sold it four months ago to the Washington Post , that he had less time for the Trib . But now he is back on the job again and his handsome , outspoken wife , Maryland McCormick , has accurately read the signs , as have top Trib executives . From staff and distaff side , the colonel has been gently urged to make changes in the paper . Says Maryland McCormick : " The odds seem to be against the extreme right wing . It 's very sad , but true , and why not face it ? "
