E d Wynn is probably the best-liked man in Hollywood . In a community where jealousy and intrigue run rampant and where cynics say , " With friends like mine , who needs enemies ? " you ca n't find one adverse witness . Ed is Hollywood 's grand old man ? and not just because of his age , which is seventy-two . It 's all right to call him Ed , by the way . Young squirts a third his age do it as casually as a broker speaks of A. T. and T. The broker means no irreverence , and in his way , Ed enjoys the same institutional eminence as American Telephone and Telegraph Company . What captivated Hollywood was Ed 's gallant comeback two years ago . After more than fifty years as a big-time comedian , his career had come to an abrupt end and he could not find a job . With a cold courage that would have done credit to a youth of twenty , he began an entirely new career as a dramatic actor . His first such role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was released , his son , Keenan , got him a part in the Playhouse 90 production of Requiem for a Heavyweight , on C.B.S . television . If the role was dramatic , the rumors that flew around Hollywood during rehearsal were even more so . Today it 's impossible to he sure just what did happen , at any time . It was said that Ed was so bad he was asked to step out of the cast . It was said that the star , Jack Palance , suddenly found he had business down the street  --  he could not bear to tell the old man he was lousing up an expensive show . It was said that Keenan broke the news , that Ed refused to quit and that Keenan came out of the interview with tears streaming down his face . Ed admits they asked him to resign . " I refused because I thought I was getting the hang of playing a real person , after being a clown all my life , " he said . " 1 felt that once we were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I had to try ! " No one had the heart to fire him , and the continuing rumors indicated that a disaster was in the offing . Nearly every actor in Hollywood made sure he saw Requiem for a Heavyweight . You could probably write the end of the script yourself . When the red light came on to warn the cast that Playhouse 90 was on the air , Ed lost the fumbling unsureness that had made him look so had during rehearsal and proceeded to steal the show . The moment they were off the air , Jack Palance made an elaborate bow to Ed and then silently wrung his hand . Keenan stood there , beaming , blowing his nose , wiping his eyes . " You 'd have thought him the proud father and Ed a son who had just made good , " a bystander said . Overnight a legend was born , and since then Ed Wynn has never lacked for work . " You see , I 'm young and fresh , and people like new faces ! " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia is being increased substantially . in 1949 , Chinese exports were almost nonexistent . By 1955 they had risen to $209 , - 000.000 . In 1958 they were S309,000,000 . India 's trade in Southeast Asia has been cut nearly 40 per cent by these new Chinese exports . Great Britain 's has also been seriously hurt . Japanese goods are being undersold 10 to 15 per cent in countries on which Tokyo has been counting as an essential market and source of raw materials . Ironically , most Chinese exports into Southeast Asia are the very consumer goods which the Peking Government denies its own people . A British bicycle in Kuala Lumpur costs thirty-five dollars . The Chinese equivalent , which sells for seventy dollars in Peking  --  more than a year 's average income  --  costs the Malayans only fourteen dollars . Although these exports fell abruptly early this year , it seems likely that the flow will again be resumed . Some observers speculate that the interruption was due to the need to meet overdue payments to the Soviet Government for heavy machinery delivered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peking has been stepping up its effort to win the political allegiance of the 13,000,000 Chinese who live in the larger Southeast Asian cities and who retain close cultural and linguistic ties with the Chinese heartland . Chinese maps , inherited , so Peking says , from Chiang Kai-shek , still proclaim Chinese sovereignty over sizable border sections of Burma , Bhutan and India . Radio Peking regularly asserts Chinese superiority over all " foreign barbarians . " Regardless of the success or failure of Chinas experiment in pure Communism , it is apparent that an explosive new force is being generated in Asia which will exert increasing influence on the world power balance . The means by which we can help blunt this force and lay the basis for orderly and peaceful relationships arc beyond the scope of this article . A few brief observations , however , may be in order : ( Continued from Page 25 ) with the droll smirk that was his trademark on Broadway for more than half a century .

In his most recent dramatic role , Ed plays Jan Dussel , the old dentist in the Twentieth Century-Fox motion picture , The Diary of Anne Frank . It 's the longest and most difficult role he has ever attempted . George Stevens , who produced and directed the picture , is not an easy man to please . Yet after working with Ed Wynn only three days , Stevens declared , " This man , I think , is the best natural actor of our times . " The Diary of Anne Frank is a powerful film . Many people may wish to forget the merciless extermination of the Jews that Hitler planned and half carried out . Stevens , who is not Jewish , made the picture to keep us from forgetting .

Although the entrance of this dynamic new element into the world stage creates profound difficulties for us , it also constitutes a potential threat to the Soviet Union . The ultimate effect on relations between Moscow and Peking is impossible to foresee . 2 . In order to cope effectively with the challenge , we Americans sorely need a long-term perspective and long-term plans to go with it . These plans should be rooted in the realities of Asian attitudes , economics , politics and geography . Expedient , crisis-to-crisis moves based on the illusion of American military omnipotence will almost certainly fail . 3 . The principles and techniques which will work best in Southeast Asia should be fundamental to American policy throughout the underdeveloped continents . These may include a more careful selection of the men and women to represent us abroad , a revamped economic-aid program , less emphasis on regimes and more on people , some such device as a World Food Bank to distribute surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices of raw materials . 4 . Although most Southeastern Asian governments are Frail and uncertain , they are increasingly aware of the danger of Chinese aggression and the brutality of Communist techniques . It is particularly reassuring that this awareness is spreading to India , which centuries ago provided the principal counterforce to Chinese expansion into Southeast Asia and may conceivably play this role in the future . 5 . Once we begin to act positively within the economic and political framework of the American revolutionary tradition , we will elicit a heart-warming response from non-Communist peoples throughout the world . In these next decisive years an awakened America , prepared to look the facts about modern Asia squarely in the face , can play a vital role in stopping the spread of Communism without war . Thoughtful men in Asia , Africa , Latin America and Europe fervently hope that we will play it . of Anne Frank is a tribute to the grandeur of the inextinguishable human spirit . It was on the Anne Frank set that I met Ed Wynn . He had just finished a scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays the title role  --  and who , by the way , is not at all out of place in this solidly talented cast . Ed is a six-footer whose bearing suggests a muscular youth . His greeting , when we were introduced , was old-fashioned and courtly , His conversation suggests a well-read man ; he talks with much bouncy emphasis . After all those years as an actor , his face is as plastic as foam rubber . His eyesight is sharp , his hearing unimpaired . We did not have much time together that day , but later we had several long talks in his expensive Wilshire Boulevard apartment , where he lives alone , surrounded by the souvenirs of his long career in the theater , motion pictures , radio and television . His memory is fantastic . When I mentioned the late W. C. Fields , Ed said without hesitation , " 1 first worked with Bill in the Ziegfeld Follies that opened September 21 , 1915 .

( here ? use lookine k.i , Nomething like this I did  --  and the show opened September 21 , 1915 , with these people in it . At first meeting , Ed gives a 1 , ivid impression of deep serenity , as of a healthy , alert old gentleman enjoying a quiet , sunny old age . This is hardly the case . This nice old man started refusing work on Nos ember first last year  --  but only because he had reached the maximum income-lax bracket . " It was n't the money , but my actor 's ego , that made me start over . " he said . " This business of involuntary retirement is a crusade with me . What this generation is doing to people my age is a crime against humanity , and sooner or later society will pay for it ! " This is not his first crusade . Behind that air of Confucian benignity lurks the shadow of a hot-tempered lighting man . For a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has spent a lot of time making many of them mad . Ed Wynn was born Isaiah Edwin Leopold in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , on November 9 , 1886 . As long as he can remember , he wanted to be an actor . By the time he was twelve , he was the despair of his father , a manufacturer of women 's hats . Ed gave a vivid impromptu description of the elder Leopold during the shooting of a scene in The Diary of Anne Frank . The script called for Ed to wait in the bathroom while the other refugees argued over whether to let him hide with them . It was a difficult scene , and they rehearsed it again and again , with everybody getting increasingly frustrated and angry . Suddenly the bathroom door opened , and Ed came out . " You know , " he said , smiling , " this makes a prophet of my father , God rest his soul . When I was a boy , he used to tell me , Go ahead , be an actor  --  but mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' Only he did n't say ' john . ' My father was an outspoken man who could be very earthy at times . Well , here I am  --  right where he said I 'd end up ! " It was an old-timer 's trick , done deliberately to break the tension that was spoiling a day 's work . It succeeded , and all those younger players got an unexpected , luminous look at other times , another century and the strong-minded man who was Ed Wynn 's father . Ed must have been as strong-minded as his father because , at fifteen , he ran off with a theatrical road company . In Maine the troupe went broke , and the boy had to ask his father for the fare home . Mr. Leopold made him promise to forget this acting foolishness and go to work . " He made me a partner and sent me out as a salesman . " Ed recalls , " but I could n't make myself feel that selling women 's hats was very important . Naturally , with this attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six months later the two had another collision . The scene now shifts to New York  --  the New York that 0 . Henry was even then writing about  --  the resplendent Gotham that was the mecca of every young artist and writer and actor in America . When Ed went there he was a strapping youth from Philadelphia who , at sixteen , looked old for his years . Unlike most of the wide-eyed youngsters pouring into New York . he knew exactly what he wanted to do . To make sure he would not have to throw himself on his father 's mercy a second time , he had foresightedly sold his millinery samples . In a beer cellar frequented by theatrical folk , he met the man he was seeking , Jack Lewis , an esperieneed actor I ee is was ten years older than Ed , but when he heard the youth 's ideas , he agreed to join him in a comedy team called the Rah Rah Boys . It 's worth rioting that the green , runaway boy was to he the comedian , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his irate father would he looking for him , he could not use his real name , He split his middle name , Edwin . into Ed Wynn  --  temporarily , he thought . The team of Wynn and Lewis was an instantaneous hit . After only one night in a neighborhood theater , the act was booked into the Colonial , the best vaudeville theater in New York , where it ran for ninety-eight weeks . By the time Mr. Leopold caught up with his errant son , it was too late . As Ed Wynn , he was a star  --  and already making more money than the family millinery factory . There was , according to Ed , nothing mysterious about his overnight success . Most comedy teams then consisted of a funnyman in funny clothes and funny make-up , and a straight man . The funny-man was lineally descended from the Adam of all comedians , the traditional clown , who originally satirized the poor boob who has nothing but had luck , and lots of it . But his sadly comical , misfit soul had long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We created real persons  --  a college freshman and a sophomore  --  and we played to intelligent people , " Ed explained . " That 's what most audiences are , and that 's why the Rah Rah Boys were a success . " What Ed and Jack Lewis had done was to discover a new , authentic comedy " type . " the college boy . Later , Ed created other distinctive personalities , such as The King 's Jester and The Perfect Fool . Although he always used the basic tools of the clown  --  costumes and make-up  --  he was different . Humor is hard to analyze , but other comedians say that Ed 's gift was his ability to draw out a simple little joke to excruciating lengths of absurdity . One of his classics was his attempt to drive a nail into the wall headfirst . Anyone this stupid is funny , and people could not wait to see his foolish face light up when it occurred to him to turn the nail around . Other comedians might have ended it there . Ed brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this nail belonged in the opposite wall This joke , which ran about three minutes , probably earned Ed $50,000 ; if you divide the total income of that show by the number of gags in it . Within a few years he was starring in the biggest Broadway shows and was a headliner in the finest vaudeville houses . He was the only American act on the bill when the Palace Theater opened in 1913 . He was the first New York actor to own an automobile . He had an estate on Long Island and a seagoing yacht that required a crew of seven . He had wanted to prove to his father that , in his own way , he could add luster to the family name , but " Ed Wynn " had taken permanent possession of him . To recite the roll of stars with whom that name was coupled , in top billing , is to call out names that still reverberate after a generation ; Lillian Russell , Nara Bayes , Sarah Bernhardt , Eva Tanguay , Enrico Caruso , David Warfield , Nazimova @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Frank Daniels , the Dolly Sisters .... It was Ed Wynn , the star , who got two unknown young dancers their first Broadway jobs . Their names were Fred and Adele Astaire . It was Ed who first suggested to two diffident young performers that they ought to tell a few jokes along with their acts . One was a pantomimist who satirized a drunk man playing pool  --  the other was a trick-rope artist . Anyone thirty or older will remember them as W. C. Fields and Will Rogers . Despite Ed 's early success , the story persists that he was not a very happy man . " He was moody and quite touchy about his dignity as an actor , " said the son of a man who knew him then . " He 'd throw his weight around if he thought he was getting a bad deal  --  or if any actor was . And do n't forget his feud with W. C. Fields ! " That vendetta began in the winter of 1915 , when Ed hid under Fields ' pool table during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fields ' act . Some hard words were traded after the curtain dropped , both men being earthy , blunt talkers . Friends separated them , but for years the two would not work in the same theater because of what was said that night . There are other legends of Ed 's feuds with theater managers , but Ed wo n't talk about them . " They 're dead now , and I 'm not mad any more , " he says . He will reminisce readily , however , about two of his most famous crusades . In the summer of 1919 , Ed was the star of the Shubert Gaieties and the best-paid actor in New York . On the night of August sixth , when he came to work , he found J. J. Shubert waiting for him . " Ed , you 're not going out , are you ' ? " Shubert asked curtly . " Out ? " said Ed . " What do you mean  --  out ? " " The actors went on strike today , " Shubert snapped . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ed knew that Actors Equity Association had been trying to negotiate a contract with the Managers Protective Association , whose twenty-seven members actually controlled the entire American theater , through their control of Broadway actors and Broadway shows . Strike talk had been circulating for a year , but the actors themselves were divided badly . Membership in Equity meant the black list , and no one really knew who belonged and who did n't . " The idea of anyone in my position belonging was ridiculous , " said Ed . " I was making seventeen hundred dollars a week  --  what could Equity do for me ? I asked J.J. to hold the curtain while I went over to the Lambs Club to see what this was all about . He agreed . " That curtain never went up . The club was jammed with striking actors . Most of the New York shows were shut down for the summer anyway , and the actors had nothing to lose . The moment Ed appeared , a shout went up , " Ed Wynn is with us  --  Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , they had hoisted him to their shoulders and were parading him up and down Broadway at the height of the dinner-hour rush . " I had n't the heart to tell those poor , hope less people that they were wrong , " Ed said . " I just could n't do it ! " So he was on strike . Once he had joined Equity , he worked hard to win the strike . Night after night he gave impromptu shows on Broadway , passing the hat for the strike fund . Thousands of dollars were raised that way , Once he and Frank Bacon , another star of the day , went to Chicago at their own expense to solicit funds from Julius Rosenwald , president of Sears , Roebuck and Cornpany . Somewhat to their surprise , they came back with Rosenwald 's personal check for $10,000 . The managers maintained a united front , and the prospect of a terrible winter on the black list was rapidly eroding Equity 's membership when , at a mass meeting one night , Ed made a speech suggesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disheartened actors booed him for suggesting that they line up with hod carriers and teamsters . But Ethel and John Barrymore supported Ed with impassioned speeches . So did Marie Dressler . And so did W. C. Fields who , in a dramatic public reconciliation , brought his feud with Ed to an end . Ed went to Washington , D.C. , as a committee of one , to negotiate with Samuel Campers , president of the AFL . He returned with a charter , and the next night , the stagehands , electricians and carpenters walked out . Four days later the managers capitulated . The rights won by that strike are taken for granted now , but then they had a rather stunning effect on their beneficiaries . It was far more than the founders of Equity had hoped to win so soon . As for Ed Wynn , he was black-listed but good . Managers who had been his personal friends  --  Florenz Ziegfeld , George M. Cohan , the Shuberts  --  not only refused to employ him but also pointedly walked out of the Lambs Club whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Actors who worked for him would be black-listed too ; so he went to circuses and carnivals for his talent and called the show Ed Wynn 's Carnival . He pawned his wife 's jewels to buy used costumes . He wrote his own music  --  all in B-flat . It 's the only key he knows . Then he could not get booking in a theater anywhere . For months he played one-night stands in lodge halls and auditoriums . Organized labor publicized his show everywhere and the Carnival played to so many overflow houses that again the managers surrendered . Ed returned in triumph to New York , where the Carnival ran for 116 of the most profitable weeks of his life . For years after that , Ed owned his own shows . He was the first to take big musical comedies on nationwide tours , traveling in an eight-car train , About this time he became friends with Gov . Alfred E. Smith , of New York . and thereby got into the second big fight of his life . The Ku Klux Klan was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of its targets . In a burst of furious loyalty to his friend , Ed routed his shows through the Indiana and Illinois counties where the Klan was strongest , and after each show made a curtain speech denouncing the Klan . Today we 're inured to seeing actors take sides in politics  --  no presidential campaign is complete without its entourage of stars . But in the 1920 's Ed was defying tradition as well as the theater owners . " They warned me I 'd ruin myself , but I knew I could always make a living in New York , " he said . " As it turned out , these tours ( Continued on Page 111 ) ( Continued/1 ' 0m Page 114 ) made big money  --  big money I Big crowds defied the Klan everywhere to come to my shows . Now . does n't that prove something about the American people ? You do n't ever want to underestimate the basic decency of human beings .

As soon as it began to decline at the box office , he laid plans for a new road trip , Many an entertainer who was a hit with New York audiences proved to be a complete flop elsewhere in the country . Yet , in fifty years , Ed Wynn never had an unsuccessful show , either in New York or on the road . Ed was the first radio entertainer to do his show in costume , before a live audience . Ells program , the Texaco Fire Chief , was among the top ten for a record-breaking eight years . During those years he continued to appear on Broadway  --  and he never missed a season on the road . He was the first radio star to broadcast his weekly programs from wherever he happened to be , usually from the stage of the theater in which he was playing . Ed had made several motion pictures , had fallen out with his producers and Most small children are so fascinated by flowers that they ca n't wait to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BROWN had sworn off Hollywood . In the 1930 's he lost more than 5300,000 trying to organize a new radio network of his own . Partly as a result of this strain , he was sick for the first time in his life . He denies that it was a nervous breakdown , as was reported at the time . " I was just tired , " he said . " I needed a rest and time to think things over . " He bought a big home in Los Angeles and went into a " retirement " that lasted all of six weeks . By the time television came along , after World War H , he had determined to live permanently in California , partly because of the climate , partly to be near his grandchildren . The Ed Wynn Show  --  in 1949 ? was the first television program to originate on the West Coast . On it such stars as Jimmy Dorante , Dinah Shore and Carmen Miranda made their TV debuts . Later , N.B.C . learned Ed , Durante , Jack Carson and Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first TV show to alternate its stars , like the offensive and defensive and punting squads of a pro-football team . it was when this show was suddenly canceled and Ed could n't find another sponsor that he became frightened for the first time in his life . It was his first failure , and probably it was as much television 's failure as Ed 's . No one really knew much about this new medium , and a lot of mistakes were made . Whoever was to blame , Ed took it hard . He was almost seventy , considered by many to be too old to work  --  but too healthy to die . For weeks he moped about his apartment , living in the past , refusing to see people , waiting for the call that never came from his agent . Anyone who has watched an elderly relative crack up will understand how Ed 's son , Keenan , felt . Years earlier , Ed had tried to discourage his son from becoming an actor . Now Keenan was one of the most popular ac tors on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were several painful interviews between the two before Keenan found the nerve to lay it on the line with his father .

Things have changed , and unless you change , too , you 're going to be a self-pitying old has-been the rest of your life , a burden to your friends and a worse burden to yourself . " It was Keenan who , in desperation , suggested that Ed try drama . " Oh , I could n't do that ! " was Ed 's quick reaction . " Why , I 'm a comedian , a funny-man . " " You arc ? " asked Keenan . " Dad , who 's laughing ' ? " Keenan got him the part in the movie The Great Man . Then came Requiem for a Heavyweight .

In Hollywood it was said that it had been driven off the air by the competition of Zorro , which had already forced Groucho Marx to give up this same Thursday-evening hour . The old fighting man came out swinging , eyes blazing . " There will always be good shows to beat , and we just did n't try hard enough , " he said . " We just did a sunshiny situation comedy , as they 're called , because sunshiny situation comedies are ' commercial ' !

" If you thought the bursts of laughter that punctuated that show came from a live studio audience , you were wrong . Whose inspiration it was to use recorded laughter on an Ed Wynn show is not known , but surely it was unfair to Ed . No matter how far he goes as a dramatic actor , Ed Wynn will be remembered longest as a comedian . To other comedians he is the peerless original  --  a classic . " Ed Wynn is the greatest of us all , " George Burns told me . " Every comedian alive today has borrowed or learned something from him . " " He was always the cleanest man on the stage , too , " said Jack Benny . " In more than fifty years he never used a naughty word or a suggestive line , yet he could keep you screaming for two hours and a half .
