The current king of the proxy fighters is a tough-talking , dapper Washington lawyer named Alfons Landa , who admits that his role in more than half a dozen battles has made him " as popular as a skunk . " Last week Landa , 60 , won his biggest battle by unseating pudgy Leopold Silberstein , 54 , from the sick Penn-Texas Corp. , taking over as president at $36,000 a year . ( Silberstein will collect $40,000 a year for five years as an " adviser . " ) Landa got into the fight nearly two years ago when Chicago 's Fairbanks , Morse decided to back him financially as a counterirritant to Silberstein , who tried unsuccessfully to win control of Fair banks , Morse . After Silberstein and Fair banks , Morse made their peace , Lawyer Landa rounded up Penn-Texas ' dissident stockholders and continued the fight . Now he faces another fight of his own against a second group of stockholders , who want to elect their own management . <P> Mother &; Freud . Landa likes to think of himself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock goes up when I clean the bastards out . " But he has found it profitable to fight most of his proxy battles on the side of management . Rarely before has he tried to take over in a corporate fight . Usually he makes his money by buying stock cheap in a sick company , selling out after he has done his bit to make the company and stock strong . " You do n't always have to do everything for a fast buck , " he says . " I 'll take mine slower . " Landa has never been slow to get his hands on money . He inherited $200,000 from his mother , spent part of it studying psychology under Sigmund Freud in Vienna , playwriting under George Pierce Baker at Yale , law at George Washington University . In 1926 he joined a top Washington law firm ( now Davies , Richberg , Tydings , Landa &; Duff ) , was soon making fat fees for defending prominent men , e.g. , Alexander de Seversky ( for his criticism of Air Force procurement ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airlines , where he took over briefly ( nine months ) as president in 1951 . He stepped back in as a consultant a couple of months later when a stockholders ' proxy fight developed because of proposals from two competing airlines to buy Colonial . Landa pacified the stockholders , managed to hold off any purchase until Colonial stock had risen . Eastern Air Lines eventually bought Colonial at $24 a share v. the $7.62 market price when Landa stepped in . <P> A Cool $1,000,000 . Landa 's most notable fight , before Penn-Texas , was at Fruehauf Trailer Co . There he defended President Roy Fruehauf against a raid after brother Harvey Fruehauf sold a large block of stock to the Detroit &; Cleveland Navigation Co . Landa proceeded to raid the raider , made himself a cool $1,000,000 on Fruehauf stock during the fight . Landa welcomes allies from any quarter . During the Fruehauf fight , he negotiated a $1,500,000 loan from the then Teamster President Dave Beck to finance Fruehauf stock purchases . <P> Landa has never stayed long in one place once he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exception . " Within six months to a year , " he says , " I 'll stem the flow of blood . " Apparently many Penn-Texas stockholders think he can do it . Penn-Texas stock , which plummeted during Silberstein 's reign from $22.87 to $2.87 a share , last week gained $2.75 to close at $6.75.
