The best way to stop smoking is to stop smoking , says Scottish Doctor Lennox Johnston . The procedure , he insists , is neither as simple nor as simple-minded as it sounds . The craving for tobacco must be understood and the dangers of nicotine appreciated before mere will power can separate a man from his pipe or his cigarettes . But it can be done . In the latest issue of the British medical journal Lancet , Johnston , a reformed smoker , tells all . <P> The original urge , says the doctor , is purely psychological , closely connected with the desire to be grown-up or sophisticated . This psychological " infection " is then spread by other smokers . " Every smoker is , in fact , whether he wills it or not , a living advertisement for tobacco , and there are so many smokers today , and they smoke and speak encouragement to smoke so often , that the persuasive pressure on non-smokers to commence or recommence smoking is powerful indeed . To this must be added the lavish scientific advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge is reinforced by a pharmacological urge-the true physical craving for tobacco . As time passes , tobacco becomes " a general analgesic against life 's little , or even big , stresses and vexations . " <P> The smoker who wants to reform , says Dr. Johnston , should be frightened by threats of lung cancer . He must understand that " tobacco smoke contains various poisons , notably nicotine , pyridine bases , carbon monoxide and arsenic . . . " <P> The most trying period , Dr. Johnston reports , is the first day and night without tobacco . Since respiratory infections reduce the urge to smoke , a man might wait until he catches cold before he begins the agony of withdrawal . Or he might try a last night of overindulgence . Too much smoking can bring on a helpful sore throat . <P> However he goes about his cure , the addict who finally gives up tobacco will recognize " an accession of high spirits , energy , appetite and sexual potency , with recession of coughing . " <P> But Dr. Johnston expects to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco 's dangers . " About 80% of us are smokers , " he estimates sadly , " and we behave collectively like an addict . . . Radical cure of tobacco smoking lies in its prevention and tobacco smoking is no more difficult to prevent than opium smoking . Our duty is plain . "
