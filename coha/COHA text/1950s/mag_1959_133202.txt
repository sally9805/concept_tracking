Standouts at forward are Billy Lickert ( Sophomore of the Year in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is back at center but will be pressed by 6-foot-9 Ned Jennings , tallest man on the squad . Small , swift guards will again be a trademark of the pattern offense , with veterans Bennie Coffman , Dick Parsons and Sid Cohen driving hardest . Sharpest thorn in the Cats ' paw is a trip to VANDERBILT , one of three teams to stop Kentucky last year . Coach Bob Polk will surround Center Bill Depp with veteran Forwards Larry Banks and Ben Rowan and sophomore Guards Bobby Bland and Bill Johnson , which means that the Commodores will need time to jell but will be a formidable foe by January . At AUBURN shooting and speed must compensate for lack of experienced tall men while two big sophomores are being groomed . Meanwhile , there is the dazzling play of Guard Henry Hart and Forwards Jimmy Fibbe and Dave Vaughn . The sophomore newcomers who must learn Auburn 's shuffle offense are 6-foot-7 Leon Posey and 6-foot-6 Johnny Helmlinger . Porter Gilbert , Ray Groover and Bayward McManus vie for the job as Hart 's playmate at guard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but saw five others depart with him . Coach Babe McCarthy has a pair of outstanding forwards , Jerry Graves and Charlie Hull , and a half dozen sophomores , three of whom may start .

Reserves are John Hutchison , Alex Singer , Roger Thomas , Gene Chatham , J. D. Gammel and Dave Glasgow . GEORGIA TECH 'S progress chart continues upward , but not at a pace that will enable the Yellow Jackets to finish much higher than last year . Coach Wack Hyder has moved starters Dave Denton and Roger Kaiser to guard , while veteran Center Wayne Richards steps out to forward . The rest of the front line will be filled by sophomores Josh Powell and Keith Weekly . This tall , fast first five will be bolstered by Forward Jim Riley , Guard Bob Dews and John Hoffman and Bill Poteet , who play either forward or guard . Coach Cliff Wells will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scramble for a first-division finish . He has four returning starters , led by the league 's most versatile center , Vic Klinker . Ron Mitchell and Gus Wenzel join him on the front line while Dick O'Brien is back at guard . ALABAMA has Guard Lloyd Johnson back from last year 's starters , with Forward Bart Vandemark the only other regular in camp . Newcomers Porter Powers , Bob Gavin and Howard Smith will try to halt the slight skid that started last year . High-scoring Jack Waters , the only Yankee on the roster at MISSISSIPPI , is joined by five returning lettermen who are determined to haul Ole Miss out of the cellar . Lou Griffin , Ivan Richmann and Tommy Washington constitute one of the tallest front lines in the league , while John King , Larry Wagster and Jamie Howell provide support . TENNESSEE lost four regulars , putting the heaviest share of this year 's burden on Dalen Showalter , the SEC 's top soph two years ago . Reserves who move up include Forwards Ron Carmichael and Bob Perigo , Centers Dick Fisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are six veterans back at GEORGIA , including classy Guard Gordon Darrah . Center John Johnson and Forwards Pat Casey and Don Keiser should start again , with Ken Taylor and Clark Royer in contention . Al Johnson , Frank Clark and John Barnard are sophs who could stir things up on a team that has good height , needs speed and a new field house . Enthusiasm is high at LSU , a green club with speed and size . Tall sophomores Tom Conklin , Joe Borgini , Ray Lewis and George Nattin will start with junior Joe Clune . Phil Raisor and Cary Guglielmo lead returnees Tom Raborn , Stan Jacobs and Dick Davies . FLORIDA 'S losses were light . Starters Bob Sherwood , Tom Simpson and Paul Mosny , with help from George Jung , Bob Shiver and soph Cliff Luyk , will pace a double-post offense for Coach John Mauer.
