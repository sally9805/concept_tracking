The tired lines of three and a half months ' hard work plain on his face , President Juscelino Kubitschek sat down at a polished oak table in Catete Palace behind a radio microphone one evening last week . He glanced down the table at the assembled members of his Cabinet , checked the time , then picked up a sheaf of papers and began to read what amounted to a nationwide appeal for patience and confidence . The slow , forceful voice was clearly heard and clearly understood : " This government took over with two main objectives : to fight inflation and to develop the country 's resources fully . " <P> Kubitschek 's battle against inflation is still too recent to have achieved reportable results ; the bulk of his speech dealt with development of resources . The President had bright news of Brazil 's petroleum industry . In 1955 , he recalled , the country produced 2,000,000 barrels of oil , enough for only ten days ' use . This year the Bahia oilfields will pump out more than 5,500,000 barrels , enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of consumption ) . Next year production of 15 million barrels is expected . And , he announced , new exchange rates are being drawn up to encourage exports . <P> The President talked of new hydroelectric projects , highway construction and agriculture , then came to the main point of his talk . Faced with growing public uneasiness over inflation and opposition claims that he is little more than a puppet manipulated by War Minister Henrique Teixeira Lott ( TIME , May 21 ) , Kubitschek assured his countrymen that he had " enough authority , energy and fighting spirit to guarantee a full five-year term which will not fall into the abyss of government marked by precariousness and instability . " Raising his voice , he added , " From the people I deserve confidence , and I ask that they wait for the results of my work ... I shall not fail your trust nor disappoint your hopes . " <P> First political reaction to Kubitschek 's speech was a general agreement that his frankness had succeeded where flowery rhetoric would have failed . But the opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moratorium on criticism . Editorialized the anti-Kubitschek daily O Estado de Sao Paulo : " The people still hope for better days . It would be good if those better days come soon , before despair has won the souls of all . Patience has its limits-and hope is not eternal . "
