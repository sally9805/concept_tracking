" I 'm better under pressure than most , " says Golfer Lloyd Mangrum , " because I 'm a ham at heart . I 'm also a gambler at heart , and I 'll take a chance rather than play it safe . It 's always better to be a winner . " Mangrum was talking about golf 's hottest current winning streak : five straight tournaments ( in Australia and the U.S. ) and close to $11,000 in prize money since November . <P> Looking like the gambler he claims to be-lean , tanned , well-tailored , and sporting a trim mustache-Mangrum has long played in the shadow of the Hogans , Sneads and Nelsons . Seldom winning the big ones , but plugging along at his trade with the gambler 's instinct for the law of averages , Mangrum manages to play in more tournaments and win more money than any other touring pro . With winnings , exhibitions and bonuses , he figures that in the past five years he has earned some $300,000 from his golfing talents . <P> Notably unsuperstitious in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition to attribute his latest streak to a new driver shaft , specially made for him : " It took me 15 years to figure out the best shaft for me , and I believe I finally have it . ' ' A better explanation is his own steady game , carefully modeled on the best points of the past masters : the booming woods of Sam Snead , the deadly accurate putts of Harry Cooper , the chip-and-pitch artistry of Johnny Revolta , the long irons of older brother Ray Mangrum . <P> Big Break . Like most topflight golfers , Texas-born Lloyd Mangrum started as a caddy . And like most , he found that cracking the pro circuit was a discouraging business . For three straight years Mangrum missed meals , slept in fleabag hotels , and was grateful when he was lucky enough to pick up $50 in a match . In 1940 he got his first break : an invitation to play in Bobby Jones ' Masters Tournament . Mangrum , then 25 , blazed an opening-round 64 , the best recorded up to that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Mangrum 's golfing career was roughly interrupted by World War II . From D-day at Omaha Beach , through France , Germany and Czechoslovakia , he picked up three Purple Hearts and four battle stars as a reconnaissance sergeant in Patton 's Third Army . He also got a badly crushed shoulder and a broken arm from a jeep accident . But Lloyd Mangrum , durable and determined , returned to the tough tournament grind convinced that " golf is a cinch compared to what I went through in the war . " His first year back , playing for the U.S. Open title , golf 's most coveted prize , Mangrum coolly sank a 75-ft. putt in the final round to stay in the running , then won a tense triple playoff from Byron Nelson and Vic Ghezzi . <P> Big Business . Strictly a playing pro and hating to teach ( " I charge $50 an hour , so even my friends will leave me alone " ) , Mangrum travels 40,000 miles a year by car , another 40,000 by air in pursuit of the tournament dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won in two weeks in 1948 at the " world championship " at Chicago 's Tarn O'Shanter , his home course .
