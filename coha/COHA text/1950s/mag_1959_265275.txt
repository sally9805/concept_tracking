EVER so often a news story has such extensive ramifications that it spills over into several TIME departments . Project Argus , in which man for the first time spun a web of electrons around the whole world , was such a story and demonstrated that TIME 'S editorial technique can as easily dissect an unwieldy mass of detail into manageable pieces as it can assemble scattered facts into a terse whole . <P> For the untold account of how Project Argus was hastily organized last summer to beat President Eisenhower 's deadline for suspending nuclear tests , and the perilous and secret voyage of the Norton Sound around Cape Horn under forced draft to fire the rockets 300 miles into the sky over the South Atlantic , see NATIONAL AFFAIRS , on the Voyage of the Norton Sound . <P> For the history of how one of the nation 's most responsible journalists learned of Project Argus , kept the story under wraps for six months out of a sense of personal responsibility , and why and how he finally decided to break it . see PRESS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation , in diagrams and prose , of the scientific reasoning that led to the gigantic experiment .

Of horses that make more money than people , of the Hollywood horse operators who write a script a day . and of the Method cowboys ? Who knows what agonies the hairy-chested prima donnas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The riding , shooting , even walking lessons they must take ; the continual risk of shooting off a sideburn ? But the western story is not merely a tale that is told by television , full of sound and fury , signifying little . It traces back to a fantastically colorful period of U.S. history , the era when there was " no law west of Kansas City , and west of Fort Scott no God .
