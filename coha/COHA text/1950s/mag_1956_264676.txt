TOLBECKEN ( 370 pp. ) - Samuel Shellabarger-Little , Brown ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> Many a professor must have a streak of Alexandre Dumas in him , but most of them would no more expose it than be caught jitterbugging . Samuel Shellabarger , who died in 1954 at 65 , had no such qualms . Years as a Princeton English professor and as head of a girls ' school failed to dim his passion for writing cloak-and-dagger fiction ( Captain from Castile , The King 's Cavalier ) , a passion that was further inflamed by 1,000,000-copy sales and nods from the Literary Guild . <P> For this posthumous novel , Tolbecken , he had to do no grubbing in libraries . Heroes do not dash , swords do not flash . But his old fans may decide that Author Shellabarger was writing something closer to his heart , if not to his imagination . The real hero of the book is an attribute : character . Old Judge Rufus Tolbecken has it in his bones , just as the family home in the town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its proud colonial lines . But as the 19th century draws to a close , the judge 's kind of character and uncompromising integrity are beginning to seem a little archaic , just as the big house seems to be an anachronism in the heart of a town daily becoming more industrialized and ugly . What is worse , the judge 's grandson , a fine lad and a Princeton man to boot , can not sustain the oaklike traditions which he so admires in the old man . He marries the wrong girl , is not much of a lawyer , and after he has fought in World War I , his sense of values is as battered as his body . <P> This is the old American story of the clash of generations , the impact of modern life on tradition . That Author Shellabarger wrote it at a pitch of sincerity can not be doubted . Unfortunately , he was a carpenter of fiction and not an architect . In his historicals , that fact was nearly a virtue . In Tolbecken it exposes all his built-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and coincidence is made to do the work of imagination . Yet it is so rare to find a contemporary novelist writing in praise of character that the literary defects seem almost less important than the simple moral lecture .
