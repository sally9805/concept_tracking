Ever since Joseph Stalin abolished the Politburo last October , the mystery inside an enigma ( as Churchill once called it ) of the Kremlin has only deepened . Who really administers the country now , the 36-man Presidium or the loman Secretariat ( kitchen cabinet ) ? On the theory that it is the smaller , tighter Secretariat , Western intelligence agents and analysts last week were keeping an eye on a newly powerful figure in it , Nikita Khrushchev . <P> Khrushchev , at 58 a cold and colorless " 100% Stalin man , " has been given unfettered authority to discipline 6,880,000 members of the Russian Communist Party , and to weld together even more tightly the parallel monoliths of party and state . Wielding such power , Khrushchev has taken his place in the Kremlin 's anteroom alongside Vyacheslav Molotov , Georgy Malenkov and Lavrenty Beria . <P> Commissar . Born the son of a miner in the tiny Ukrainian village of Kalinovka , Khrushchev is what the Communists call a Vydvizhenets , one who is " pushed forward . " As commissar for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaked cap , but still orates in the rough accent of his early years as a shepherd lad and a child laborer in the Czar 's coal mines . <P> Khrushchev joined the party in 1918 , got his first taste of slaughter in the bloody Civil War that ravaged the Ukraine after the Communist Revolution . In the ' 20s , he assisted in the liquidation of the kulaks and the mass deportation of millions of Ukrainian peasants ; in the second Five Year Plan ( 1933-38 ) , he bossed the excavation of Moscow 's subway stations . His reward was the Order of Lenin and one of the party 's toughest assignments : to stamp out the lingering embers of Ukrainian nationalism . <P> Purges . The Ukrainians , 40 million strong and proud of their own mother tongue , have a local patriotism as fierce as any Scot 's . " For many centuries , " Khrushchev himself once proclaimed , " the Ukrainian people fought for the right to develop their own culture , build their own schools , publish their own literature . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bourgeois nonconformity " that Khrushchev was sent to Kiev in 1938 . Characteristically , he started with a purge , not only of the " enemies of the people " ( i.e. , Ukrainian patriots ) but of " all Communists who have lost their vigilance . " Three thousand local party secretaries went to the cellar or were shipped to Siberia ; six of the Ukraine 's twelve provinces got new party chiefs . Purger Khrushchev 's prize was the Order of the Red Banner of Labor and full membership in the Politburo . <P> Guerrilla . In World War II , Khrushchev took charge of the mass guerrilla movement that scorched the black earth of the Ukraine in the Wehrmacht 's rear , won the Stalingrad Medal for his services as a political commissar . At war 's end he went back to the war-charred Ukraine with orders from the Kremlin to 1 ) revive its agriculture and heavy industry ; 2 ) liquidate the Ukrainians who had collaborated with the Nazis . He succeeded on both counts . " Half the leading workers have been done away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
