As Washington saw it , Russia 's Nikita Khrushchev was backed into an embarrassing corner by the U.S.-NATO refusal to give up war-won rights to stay in West , Berlin . But he was not yet ready to give up the diplomatic battle . His potshots of the week : <P> Russian First Deputy Premier Anastas I. Mikoyan got a three-month diplomatic visa from the U.S. embassy in Moscow , got ready to hit Washington some time next week for a two-week visit . Presumed intention : to feel out the firmness of U.S. policy on West Berlin and to explore a possible deal for all of Germany , perhaps on the basis of Communist or neutralist disengagement schemes . <P> Khrushchev 's Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko added the Kremlin 's characteristic rocket-rattling buildup for such a diplomatic mission . Said Gromyko : West Berlin is a threat to the peace , and if the West should try to force its way through a Berlin blockade , " the flames of war would inevitably spread to the American continent , for today 's military techniques have virtually eliminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at hand . ' ' <P> Khrushchev 's new shots notwithstanding , U.S. officials went on preparing new proposals for Germany that were based on proven and continuing firmness . Principal element : reunify Germany by free elections with free choice on whether or not to join NATO . Possible tactic : offer the Russians a new European security treaty guaranteeing that no new German militarism could threaten them , even to the point of guaranteeing not to move NATO troops forward of their present positions in West Germany .
