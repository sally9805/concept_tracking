A woman shall be good for everything in the home , but abroad good for nothing . <P> - Euripides <P> Greeks , mythological , ancient and modern , have long been the arbiters of womanly beauty , but their local queens have an uncertain record . Venus won the golden apple from Paris the shepherd , but helped him provoke the Trojan War ; Callisto won the glances of Juno 's husband , and was promptly turned into a bear ; Aliki Diplarakou , Miss Greece of 1929 , dressed up in men 's clothes and smuggled herself into the monks ' sanctuary on Mount Athos that had stood , inviolate , since the Byzantine Empire . The following year the contests were discontinued , and in 1936 Strongman Metaxas decreed that no woman should go abroad with a hemline more than twelve inches from the ground . <P> Last year with Metaxas dead and gone , the big Athens newspaper Ethnos ran a " Miss Greece of 1952 " competition , and their winner placed third in the Miss Universe contest in Long Beach , Calif . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast drachma started beauty contests all over the place . In Athens alone , there were more than 30 such contests . All this was heady stuff for a country where only last year women got the vote . <P> " Another Hollywood . " It was too much for 1,500 devout Greeks who call themselves Followers of St. John the Baptist and St. Athanasius . Cried their leader , Father Augustinios Kantiniotis : " Public scandals are being prepared . . . exhibitions of naked bodies . . . Paul the Apostle wrote that Christian women should ' adorn themselves in modest apparel , ' but the organizers of these orgies say , ' Do n't listen to Paul . . . undress yourselves . . . and become known as Miss Universe ! ' Greeks , war veterans , mothers and fathers , shout , ' Down with these orgies ! ' . . . and , with the help of Jesus Christ , we will prevent Greece from being turned into another Hollywood . " The Holy Synod of the Greek Orthodox Church approved the stand of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contests as " the climax of sin . " <P> The government was not willing to offend either womankind or Ethnos , one of its biggest supporters , so the Miss Greece finals went on last week as scheduled . Shiny lines of Buicks and Cadillacs brought 700 VIPs ( including ex-Premiers Sophocles Venizelos , Constantine Tsaldaris and a dozen Cabinet or ex-Cabinet ministers ) to the swank , open-air Argentina Club , by the waterfront at Phaleron Bay . Admission charge : $9 a head ( drinks extra ) . Eleven finalists paraded , first in bathing suits , then in evening gowns . Outside the club , 200 policemen waited in their squad cars for something more exciting to happen . It soon did . <P> " Body Worship . " Six cassocked priests , accompanied by 200 of their supporters , turned up at the gate , carrying picket signs that read , " Stop this body-worship . " Then another group ran a fishing boat close inshore , a few hundred feet from the Argentina , and tried to storm the beachhead from behind . This disturbance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nightclub , in white jacket , strictly in line of duty . " Pick a few of them up , " he commanded .
