INVESTIGATIONS Joe 's Bloody Nose Like most successful rough &; tumble fighters . Senator Joe McCarthy always presses in , and is adept at forensic kneeing , gouging and butting . As a consequence , most of his senatorial colleagues give him a wide berth . But last week , when he set out to defend J. B. Matthews , executive staff director of his subcommittee , McCarthy finally gave his critics in both parties a wide and irresistible opening . They jumped him en masse , and Fighting Joe did not get up from among the cuspidors until he had the legislative equivalents of a split lip , a bloody nose and two black and shiny eyes-the first such clubbing he has taken in 6 years in the Senate . <P> McCarthy managed to make a spectacular brawl of it , even though Doctor Matthews had made himself virtually indefensible by charging , in the American Mercury , that " the largest single group supporting the Communist apparatus in the U.S. today is composed of Protestant clergymen " ( TIME , July 13 ) . A longtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions perhaps as far back as McCarthy 's first out-on-the-limb blast at Communism in the State Department , made at Wheeling , W.Va. in February 1950 . Matthews has been a member of what Westbrook Pegler calls " our cell of Red baiters , " a group with which McCarthy also mingled . " It is not an organized group of Red baiters , " Pegler has explained . " But Mr. Matthews is an amateur cook . . . He cooks a meal and we go down and . . . take part in a small , festive evening . " <P> When members of the seven-man subcommittee demanded that they be allowed to vote on firing Matthews , Joe refused and coolly announced that , as chairman , he and he alone had the right to hire and fire committee employees . <P> Highhanded Stand . It was a shrewd if highhanded stand ; by long precedent the chairmen of Senate committees do hire and fire employees . But it is also understood that they get the consent of other members . Aware of this , Fighting Joe backpedaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in return for the promise of Michigan 's Republican Senator Charles E. Potter to go along with McCarthy 's claim to sole control over committee employees . That got all three Republicans back on McCarthy 's side again . <P> With McCarthy 's future control of the staff thus assured , the subcommittee 's three Democratic members . Senators Henry ( " Scoop " ) Jackson , Stuart Symington and John McClellan , resigned from the committee in a body , charging that they had been put in the " impossible position of having responsibility without . . . authority . " The Senate 's Democrats were backing them . The Democratic leadership made it plain that they would not be replaced until McCarthy mends his ways . The Democratic boycott would not keep the subcommittee from functioning , but might expose its conclusions to increased criticism . <P> Meanwhile , for the first time , Virginia 's powerful and respected Senator Harry Byrd delivered a pointed attack on Mc-Carthyism . " Mr. Matthews , " he said , " should give names and facts to sustain his charge or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of his fellow Americans for his own notoriety and personal gain .
