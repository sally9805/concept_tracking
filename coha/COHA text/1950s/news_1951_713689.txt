txt The growing strength of the West showed itself between the lines in the Big Four meeting of the foreign ? ministers ' deputies here in Paris this week . There is still not sufficient strength to cause Russia to feel that it must negotiate seriously and significantly . At least , there was no evidence of such an attitude during the first meetings of the conference . But the improving position of the democracies most certainly found expression . To begin with , at the moment of the opening of the meeting of the deputies , the Soviet Cominform launched a huge new " peace " campaign which is to be made the " urgent " task of the Communist parties throughout the world . Its purpose is to try to drum up public opinion to press , even before this one is ended . for still another international conference , including China , and to try to make sure it is held on Soviet terms . Moscow 's anxiety for such conferences . even when it is not yet ready to use them constructively , underlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . A A A This is all to the good . At this , stage , while the Soviet planners want to use any propaganda or conference the ) can lay their hands on , in ordet to try to intimidate and split the western democracies , they may soon have to decide wha=. they are going to do when they discover that they can not in- , timidate or split the Atlantic ' community ' alliance . At that point will come the fateful test of Soviet intentions . What , is encouraging about the Paris meeting now in progress is that there is no sign of any chink in the basic unity of America , Britain , and France , and not the merest By ROSCOE DRUMMOND breath of a suggestion that well , maybe , just a little appeasement would n't do any harm . This is further evidence of the developing strength of the free world . The democracies are in a visibly improved position , and this improvement rests upon solid developments . Moscow is showing itself very sensitive to these developments , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace " crusade may well be the Kremlin 's final attempt to avert the unity of the West before seeking to deal with its consequences in serious negotia tion . While Moscow 's capacity for trouble can never be safely dismissed , it is useful to look at the circumstances which have considerably altered the military and diplomatic position . The principal ones are these : America 's determined and massive mobilization of defensive strength , and the conclusive evidence that the United States is not withdrawing either from Europe or from Korea . The harmonization of American , British , and French views on German rearmament . The speed and success with which Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower has established his Supreme . Headquarters , Allied Powers in Europe , and the increasing self-confidence which the whole common defense effort is giving to the people of western Europe . The continued proof of Marshal Tito 's independence of Moscow and the evidence that the former Soviet satellite country is a source of military strength to the defense of all Europe . The new defections in the Communist parties in Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party resignations in Italy . The inability , thus far , of China 's huge invasion army to crack the United Nations defense line in South Korea , plus the acute losses which the Chinese Communist Army has suffered . The present stalemate in Korea is now proving more costly to the Chinese than to the UN forces , and the dilemma which this poses for Prime Minister Joseph Stalin ? who induced . Communist China to enter the war on the assumption that it would be an easy - victory ? in part explains the Cominform 's new " urgent peace " offensive . The Cominform 's harassed appeal for another conference , including China , shows that Stalin either is ready to keep up the propaganda as Mao Tze-tung is ready to keep up the fighting , or that Moscow is really looking for away to extract Mao from his difficulties . .
