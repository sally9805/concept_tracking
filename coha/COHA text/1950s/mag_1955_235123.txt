The two hottest personalities in Hollywood last week were neither blonde and seductive , nor tall , dark and handsome . They were a couple of shrewd , bouncy septuagenarians with white fringes around their bald heads . Producer Samuel Goldwyn , 73 , was hard at work on the Runyonesque musicomedy Guys and Dolls . Cecil Blount DeMille , also 73 , was producing and directing a supercolossal remake of his first ( 1923 ) The Ten Commandments . These two movies , bossed by two old experts , were the most expensive and most talked about in town , and both were a long-way from The Squaw Man , Hollywood 's first feature length film , made by Goldwyn and DeMille 42 years ago , when DeMille practically discovered Hollywood singlehanded . They have helped shape the industry from the nickelodeon era to the television age and have seen the movies acquire audiences , income , longer running time , a tongue , color and superscopic wide screens . <P> A Lot of Scratch . Goldwyn has never pinched his moviemaking pennies in his zeal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Marlon Brando , Frank Sinatra , Jean Simmons , Vivian Elaine and 16 Goldwyn Girls , is budgeted at $5,500,000 . Goldwyn paid $1,000,000 merely for the screen rights to the Broadway musical and that , as a Goldwyn hireling put it in Runyonese , " is a lot of scratch . " It is probably the highest price ever paid for a single film property . <P> DeMille likes to do things with an even more lavish hand . The Ten Commandments , with Yul Brynner , Charlton Heston , Anne Baxter , Sir Cedric Hardwicke , some 20,000 extras and a 300,000-gallon tank filled with water to play the Red Sea , is budgeted at $8,000,000 . But the film version of the story of Moses from the time he is taken from the bulrushes until , a bearded old man , he climbs Mount Nebo , is expected , almost literally , to run forever in movie houses throughout the world . The picture will take at least 3 hours to play and Paramount hopefully estimates that it will gross as much as $100 million . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the set , puts on one of the great shows in show business . A retinue of eleven follows him wherever he goes . He is attended by an associate producer , a personal female aide , a couple of press-agents , a dialogue director , two script girls , a secretary , an assistant director , a mike boy to thrust a microphone before his mouth whenever he feels like really thinking out loud , and a chair boy to slip a chair under him whenever he feels ( in the manner of Queen Victoria ) in the mood for sitting . <P> DeMille 's conception is so grandiose that his movie dominates the entire Paramount studio , occupying twelve of the 18 sound stages . To film the six-minute Red Sea sequence , where the waters part and close as the children of Israel flee the Egyptians , more space was found by breaking down fences and spreading out in the adjoining RKO lot ( where razed buildings will eventually be replaced ) .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
