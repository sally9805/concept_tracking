txt Former President Hoover said today that a " grievous list " of Presidential agreements during twenty years of Democratic rule had reduced human freedom throughout the world . In an address at ceremonies marking his eightieth birthday , Mr. Hoover charged that such agreements hadshackled this nation 's economy and had produced the jeoPardies of the " cold war . " " In our foreign relations there are great dangers and also vital safeguards to free men , " he declared . " During the last war we witnessed a special encroachment of the Executive upon the Legislative Branch . This has been through a new type of commitment of the United States to other nations . " The agreement in the early Nineteen Thirties that led to the recognition of Russia , he asserted , , had " opened the headgates for a torrent of traitors . " " Our tacit alliance with Soviet // Russia spread communism over the earth " he declared . " Our acquiescence in the annexation by Russia of the Baltic States at Moscow and the partitipn of Poland at Teheran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The agreements at Yalta in 1945 placed ten nations " in slavery , " he went on , while " the secret agreement with respect to China * " set in train the cornmuniz-ation of Mongolia , North Korea and all of China . " Thousands of Iowans and scores of personal friends from all over the nation gathered within sight of the tiny three-room cottage in which he was born to hear Mr. =loover acknowledge the greetings to him and offer the American people a credo . They heard him call for the end of the " century of the Common Man . " " The imperative need of this nation , at all times , is the leadership of the uncommon men or women , " he declared . " We need Men and women who can not be intimidated , who are not concerned with applause meters , nor those who sell tomorrow for cheers today . " Speaking from a gaily decked platform set up , on the edge of the lush corn fields that had attracted his parents here nearly a century ago , Mr. Hoover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poison gas " generated by " the cousins of socialism " and the " fuzzy-minded intellectuals . " ' Gimmicks ' Are Decried " This cult has a host of giminicks for giving away the people 's money , " he asserted . " Among their ideas is that the Government should guarantee every citizen security from the , cradle to the grave . During the last twenty years , Mr. Hoover said , the traditional division of powers in this nationj has become confused and weak- ' Pried ; the Federal Government has grasped many of the vital functions of the local and state governments . " The remedy , " he added , " is to restore the checks and balances of power , to . reinvigorate state and local governments and to deflate the bureaucratic empires . " The system of checks and balances also must be extended to restrict the type of commitment the President may make with other nations , Mr , Hoover went on . " The real issue , " he said , " is whether the President , through declaration or implication or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with foreign . officials , can commit the American people to foreign nations without the specific consent of the elected representatives of the people . * * " " These unrestrained Presidential actions have resulted in a shrinking of human freedom over the whole world . * -- * ? - ? We must Make such misuses of power forever impossible . And let me say , I have no fears of this evil from President Eisenhower , but he will not always be President . " The former President concluded on this note : " Eighty years is a long time for a man to live . As the shadows lengthen over my years , my confidence , my hopes and dreams for ray countrymen are undimmed . This confidence is that with advancing knowledge , toil will grow less exacting ; that fear , hatred , pain and tears may subside ; that the regenerating sun of creative ability and religious devotion will refresh each morning the strength and progress of my country . " Eisenhower Sends Message In a letter read before the address , President Eisenhower sent his greetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation . " Few men in our country 's history have been privileged to serve the nation in so many important capacities as have you , and certainly none has done so with greater brilliance and devotion , " the President wrote . " * * *Your party and your country are proud of you ; Americans know that you have ever used your great talents in the interests of all . " The President 's message was read by Wilbur M. Brucker , general counsel for the Department of Defense and former Governor of Michigan . Mr. Brucker also read a message of praise . from Charles E. Wilson , the Secretary of Defense . Vice President Richard M. Nixon , who had been scheduled to read the President 's letter , was unable to attend . He sent a telegram saying he could not come because the close voting on the farm law required his presence in the Senate . During the ceremonies Mr. Hoover received his eightieth honorary degree .
