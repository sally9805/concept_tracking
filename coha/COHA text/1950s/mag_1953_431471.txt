 | The Trouble with Men By Corey Ford Welt-known humorist ; author of " Every Dog Should Have a Man , " etc . EVER SINCE I Wrote an article in The Reader 's Digest about the rouble with women , * I 've been having a lot of trouble , especially with women . Their letters have ranged from a recommendation that 1 should be boiled in oil to the pointed suggestion that I ought to remain single and thus make some poor girl happy . On one point they 've all agreed : the trouble with women is men . For instance , a wife in Ohio said the trouble with her husband was , he never puts tops back on things . " I spend half my time putting things on things he took them off of , " her letter stated . " He leaves the cover off the marmalade , the cap off the milk bottle , the cork out ( if the thermos jug , he even leaves the top off his pajamas . The only thing he puts back on is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wife Is Different , " Febmiry , ' 53 . Another correspondent , who signed herself " Indignant , " claimed that men never put anything back where they found it because they put it in their pockets instead . " The worst part of it is , " wrote Mrs. Indignant , " they ca n't remember which pocket they put it in . The other night we went to the theater , and my husband looked for the tickets in the change pocket of his overcoat , and he said , " That 's funny , I had them right here a minute ago , ' and then he looked in the right-hand pocket of his tuxedo , and then all his other pockets and then he said , Are you sure you have n't got them , dear ? ' and he began slapping himself all over , and he was starting over again when he remembered the tickets were in his name at the box office . " " The reason they ca n't find anything in their pockets is because they keep everything else in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Take my husband : he keeps a comb and some pipe cleaners and 37 cents in loose change and the key to the house on Myrtle Avenue where we used to live and the leather case for his driving glasses that he lost and last year 's timetable and a letter I gave him to mail a week ago Tuesday , and everything that he does n't have room for in his pocket he puts in his wallet , and then he puts his wallet in his pocket , too . And they talk about a woman 's handbag ! " Another thing that annoys most wives , judging from my letters , is the fact that men are never ready when dinner is . " No matter what time I put a meal on the table , " stated Mrs. J. Furbish of New York , grimly , " my husband always has to make just one quick phone call , or run upstairs for a minute , or finish this article he 's reading in the paper . " Wives tell me they could forgive a husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the newspaper to the table with him and propping it against the sugar bowl and reading it all through the meal . This is particularly true at breakfast , according to a Mrs. Freem in Pennsylvania . " I try to make interesting conversation , " wrote Mrs. Freem , " like telling him the funniest dream I had last night , or asking him whether he thinks this slip-cover material matches the drapes in the hall , or reading him a letter I just got from Elsie McAnkle I have n't seen her since we roomed together at Vassar and she 's married now a living in Wisconsin ? and all ever answers is , What time is it ? According to wives , there several basic things that could improved in their husbands . ( " I will doubtless come as a surprise most husbands , as it certainly did me , because we have always figur men were more or less perfect , exc : maybe they could use a shave . T characteristic modesty of the av ? age male was commented on forcil in quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're so helpless . " My ht band could n't sew a button if pants depended on it , " wrote M Furbish . " All mine can do , " agreed Mrs. Freem , " is stand at the t. of the stairs and holler ' What d you do with my shirt studs ? ' " " Y. should see mine try to pack his o suitcase , " added the correspondent signed Indignant . 2 . They 're all hypochondria . " They got an idea they 're so r ged , " scoffed a wife in California " just because a man takes a c. shower in the morning and does pay any attention to his wife wh she reminds him to put on a to coat in case of rain . And th that night he wakes her up tell her that his throat feels d when he swallows , he 's perspiring over , and he 's got this funny p. here when he sits up and it hu here when he lies down , and wo she feel if his forehead is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about himself , whose name is on  | the labels in our medicine cabinet ? " 3 . They do n't understand feminine intuition . A man will follow the road map very carefully and take the route the garageman told him , but a woman will shake her head and say , " I 've got a hunch we ought to turn off here , " or , " Let 's try this toad , George , it ought to go somewhere . " " The worst part of it is , " w rote Mrs. Furbish , " he always gets mad when it turns out I was right . " 4 . They do n't understand feminine logic . " My husband could n't gore out how we could afford a trip to Florida this winter , " Mrs. Argle wrote , " and I told him it would n't cost any more than if I bought a fur coat . He said we could n't afford a fur coat either . $o I said all right , we could stay home and do over the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money to do over the living room I told him by not buying a fur coat , so all we had to do was use the money we saved and go to Florida . " 5 . They 're not even good mechanics . " All this talk about a man being able to fix anything ! " scoffed a Utah wife . " My husband ca n't even find where he put the screwdriver ! And take yesterday morning . Our electric stove quit , so he opened the door and looked inside , and he kicked it a couple of times , and he unscrewed the burner , and then he called up the electrician , and the electrician came over and he put in new coils and changed all the wires , and still it would n't start , so I asked him what this round button was and he said it was n't a button , it was the letter ' o ' in the word ' stove , ' and I pushed it , and the stove started . " 6 . They 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I smell smoke , " a Mrs. Trench told me , " it turns out it 's my husband on fire again . He leaves his cigarette on the edge of the mantel , he drops his cigar butt down behind the car seat , he knocks the coals of his pipe onto his vest . The other day he lit his own pants while striking a match . " I 've shown these letters to a lot of husbands I know , and their explanation is that men are usually so preoccupied with more important matters , like who 's going to take the National League pennant or how Joe broke 8o the other day , that they ca n't concentrate on a little thing like threading a needle . The . reason a husband forgets what it was that he was to be sure and pick up at the supermarket on the way home , they say , is because he has worked hard all day at the office , whereas a woman has nothing to do but the housework and getting the children off to school and weeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only solution is for a wife to make the best of it , and put up with these masculine foibles . After all , if it were n't for husbands , there would n't be any wives .
