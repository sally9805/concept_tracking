txt Theodore W. Kheel , former impartial chairman of the ? private transit industry , made substantial headway yesterday toward an arbitration pact to end the twentyseven-day bus strike . Mr. Kheel , who flew from the Bahamas Sunday night to assist in the stalled peace efforts , was pressing to work out an accord in time for submission to members of the Transport Workers Union , C. I. 0. , at a closed meeting at 2:30 P. M. today at St. Nicholas. , Arena , Sixty-sixth Street and Coltunbus Avenue . The talks recessed at 12:30 A. M. , Mr. Kheel said , after " several hours " of negotiations . The former transit arbiter declined to make any firm forecast ' that he would succeed in his attempt to effect a settlement before the deadline , and company and ' union spokesmen were too groggy from days of wrangling over legal language to venture any predictions of their own . However , Mr. Kheel 's entrance into the situation did bring from Michael J. Quill , president of the union , the first public admission since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In spite of the so-called transit experts at City Hall , we have gotten further in the last twenty-two hours than in the last twenty-two days , " Mr. Quill declared in union ' Strike ' rePort " list ' ilia over Station WJZ-TV . Secret Parleys Held He said secret conferences involving company and union representatives and Mr. Kheel would continue in the hope that both sides could agree on a formula . However , the union chief warned that failure to reach an accord before today 's union rally would postpone any possibility of a settleinent until the end of the week , because the union did not intend t8 call another meeting of the strikers before Saturday . Company officials would not sayi anything about the progress of the peace talks . They refused to disclose where tile meetings were be-1 ing held or even that they had participated in them . Mr. Kheel and union leaders were sworn to I secrecy about the identity of the company representatives they conferred with . The secrecy on the management side stemmed from the immediate reaction at City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short a Nassau vacation to become the central figure in settling the bus strike on terms originally suggested by Mayor Impellitteri and the Board of Estimate 's mediation committee . The Mayor and other high city officials have been cool to Mr. Kheel since he refused an invitation earlier in the strike to associate himself with the city mediators in their efforts to end the tie-up . Company spokesmen admitted that they were fearful that they would lose out on city tax concessions to finance a forty-hour lweek if there appeared to be any tie-in between the companies and IMr . Kheel 's return . Mr. Quill anInounced publicly that he had asked Ithe former impartial chairman to come back , but there was no similar announcement from any of the I bus operators . The Mayor went out of his way yesterday to warn the union and the companies that the city would not underwrite " any improvident and profligate formula " for settling the strike . This was taken as an indication that the Board of Estimate would not feel obliged to grant tax relief or other benefits for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Mayor in a television talk on the third day of the strike . The original Impellitteri plan , which was rejected by the union as inadequate , called for a forty-hour week with wage increases of 181 , to 20 cents an hour . This would bring the basic hourly pay on six of the struck lines to $1.86 , the rate now paid on the city-owned subway , elevated and surface facilities , and on the two other lines to $1.92 , one cent above the highest rate now in effect anywhere in the country . Last week the Mayor substituted an arbitration plan for his earlier wage offer . He suggested that the union pick one arbitrator , the companies a second , and the two men so ? designated a third . The pane would have final authority to decide what the union should get and what the companies should give , but it would have no authority to bind the city on financial concessions . Both the companies and the union have accepted the arbitration ? plan in principle , but they have been unsuccessful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measure of protection they believe they must have before letting the board rule on their differences . The choice of the neutral arbitrator has become a major stumbling block , even though , in theory , this choice will not be made until the company and union representatives on ' the panel have been selected . In his statement warning against any " improvident and profligate " settlement , the Mayor expressed new hope that the state would assist in financing a forty-hour week by giving up some of the $3,000 , - 000 in taxes it collects from the New York bus companies . This was an indirect slap at a report completed over the week-end by the Public Service Commission , which suggested that the city give up some of its $3,000,000 in bus , taxes but made no reference to I the equal sum ' he state gets from the companies . The Mayor reiterated his de-'I termination to retain the basic 10-cent fare on the bus lines . Other members of the Board of Estimate made it plain that there would be no break in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission 's finding that some companies might need a fare increase to meet the union 's demands .
