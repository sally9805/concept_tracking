The New Captain Before a hushed audience of a thousand or more attentive golfers , Francis Ouimet stepped soberly up to the first tee of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club at St. Andrews , Scotland . It was early for a round : not yet 8 o'clock . But Ouimet was not going to play even once around : all he intended to do was to hit this one ceremonial drive . Scotland 's Willie Auchter-lonie , who won the British Open in 1893 , teed up the ball . The town clock tolled eight as Ouimet took his stance . Strung out in front of the tee , at various flattering-and unflattering-distances , were the St. Andrews caddies . <P> Ouimet smacked the ball crisply , 170 yards straight down the fairway , and an antique cannon beside the tee boomed a salute . It was the traditional " driving in " ceremony , performed each year-but not always so well-by the elected Captain of the Royal and Ancient , golf 's oldest and holiest shrine . Francis Ouimet , onetime caddy from the wrong side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected captain . <P> A $5 Gold Piece . Ouimet 's drive was retrieved by one of the more flatteringly distant caddies , who pounced on the ball and brought it back for the traditional reward : a gold sovereign ( which in recent years has been specially struck by the Royal Mint for the R. &; A. ) . Instead of the sovereign , Ouimet gave the caddy an old $5 gold piece . <P> Everybody agreed that picking Francis Ouimet ( pronounced we met ) for this rare honor was a happy choice and a nice gesture . Ouimet has been a name in transatlantic golf ever since the day in 1913 when , as a 20-year-old , he whipped Britain 's peerless pair , Harry Vardon ( by five strokes ) and Ted Ray ( by six ) , in a playoff for the U.S. Open title . Since then , as a player or the non-playing captain of every U.S. Walker Cup team until 1949 , Ouimet has won an unequaled place in the hearts of R. &; A. members , surpassing even Bobby Jones . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( i.e. , president ) of the R. &; A. , Ouimet occupies a purely honorary post , serves as custodian , for a year , of the St. Andrews cross : two silver clubs joined together . But he joins a tradition almost as old as golf itself . Historians estimate that the natives of St. Andrews first began to use the links , * bounded by St. Andrews Bay and the estuary of the Eden River , around 1100 . It was a natural golf course , and only nature has been allowed to change its contours . No man-made traps or bunkers have ever been permitted . <P> The Old Course , stretching like a shepherd 's crook across the dunes , still belongs to the villagers of St. Andrews-and they have the papers to prove it . In 1552 , a parchment provided that the Archbishop of Hamilton might raise rabbits there if he also allowed the townspeople to continue their " golf , futball , schuting . . . " In the late 18th Century the town lost title to the land , but bought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , anyone with the price of the greens fee ( three shillings and sixpence-about 50 ) can play at St. Andrews .
