General Mark Wayne Clark forged ahead with his program of pressure on the Communist enemy . <P> At General Van Fleet 's Eighth Army headquarters last week , an Air Force contingent from Washington-acting Air Force Chief of Staff Nathan Twining , Air Force Under Secretary Roswell Gilpatric and six major generals-conferred on the air situation . Three days later some 70 U.S. Thunderjets attacked a North Korean officers ' - training school near the Yalu , smashed and burned the barracks that housed 1,500 enemy cadets . When the enemy 's MIGs tried to interfere , escorting U.S. Sabres shot down twelve of the Red jets . The indications were that more heavy U.N . air blows were on the schedule . <P> Generators Down . Heavy reinforcements of planes and pilots were being dispatched from the U.S. to beef up Mark Clark 's air strength . Although Washington was holding the figures under a security lid , Columnists Joseph and Stewart Alsop estimated that " the planned reinforcement will increase the overall strength by 40% , and the strength in jet planes by an even higher percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more air pressure might force the Reds to sign a truce . <P> Navy and Air Force planes were still picking away last week at what remained of the North Korean power plants , smashed up in the sensational raids of late June . Photo reconnaissance of the June attacks showed that all the generator houses at three power sites had received direct hits , presumably smashing most of the Japanese-built generators beyond repair ( even if the Reds had the spare parts ) . Air intelligence officers believed that hundreds of small North Korean factories ( making small arms , small-caliber ammo , grenades , bayonets , uniforms , canteens , shoes ) and ordnance shops ( repairing trucks , tanks , artillery and locomotives ) had been shut down , and that the enemy 's radar net had been forced to switch to auxiliary generators , which are at the mercy of fuel deliveries . <P> Private Talk . The import of all this was not lost on the Communist delegates at Panmunjom , who showed less truculence at the truce table . <P> The U.N . had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might enable the Reds to agree to voluntary repatriation of prisoners . The U.N . proposed to reclassify and move out of its stockades all prisoners unwilling to return to Communist control , so that , at the time of any exchange , all remaining prisoners would be available for repatriation . The Communists were interested in this ; but it still stuck in their craw that three out of four of the U.N . ' s Chinese prisoners had indicated that they would forcibly resist any attempt to send them home . The Reds continued to demand the unconditional exchange of all " foreign " ( non-Korean ) prisoners . Nevertheless , they asked for a one-day recess to study the U.N . proposal , then for executive sessions to shield " realistic discussions . " The U.N . agreed . A U.N . briefing officer told newsmen that the private proceedings were noticeably free of propaganda tirades .
