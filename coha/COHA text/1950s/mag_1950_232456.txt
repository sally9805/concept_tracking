In a series of speeches and statements last week , the nation 's top military men and its top civilian officers set out to reassure Europeans , and anyone else who was listening , that : 1 ) the U.S. is n't trying to pick a war with Russia but 2 ) should war come , the West could defend itself without matching Russia man for man and gun for gun . <P> " We are not engaged in war , but in peace , " Secretary of State Acheson told a congressional committee . The cold war " is not a good phrase and might well be dropped . " In St. Louis , President Truman declared : " I wish to emphasize that the objective of our efforts is peace , not conflict . What we seek is not domination over any other nation or people , but simply the creation of a just international order . " He denounced Russia for " fomenting aggression and preparing for war , " but used the word " peace " 29 times in his speech . <P> Peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these avowals of peaceful intentions ?

Western forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a speech at West Point , must " be prepared to meet these masses of heavily mechanized ground forces with smaller numbers of highly scientific ground troops equipped with revolutionary new weapons . " <P> With improvements in recoilless weapons , the bazooka , the shaped charge and " the more recent developments with regard to guided missiles and rockets , target-seeking equipment and the possibilities of tactical use of atomic weapons , " said Pace , " it may well be that tank warfare as we have known it will soon be obsolete . " <P> Said J.C.S. Chairman Omar Bradley : " A year ago , the successful defense of Western Europe , in the face of a coordinated enemy attack , was a remote possibility , " but now an " optimistic estimate " was possible . Acheson said the West 's " real strength . . . lies in its inventiveness , initiative and technology .
