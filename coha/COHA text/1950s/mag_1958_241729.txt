As the new West Indies nation moves toward next March 's election of a federal legislature and formation of its first government , the eleven main islands are gradually getting more freedom from Britain in local affairs . This week a big helping of self-government goes to Barbados , sugargrowing " little England " of the West Indies , where for 300 years a select " plantocracy " has run the British Commonwealth 's third oldest Parliament ( after Britain itself and Bermuda ) . Governor Sir Robert Arundell will hand over part of his remaining powers to Barbados ' first Cabinet , bossed by Socialist Prirne Minister Sir Grantley Herbert Adams , 59 . <P> Under the Cabinet system , the governor will still appoint members of the island 's various boards , will still be responsible for external affairs and internal security . But Adams will be able to initiate legislation on his own , rather than in consultation with the governor , will get a measure of control over the police . <P> A stolid , dour lawyer , Adams reversed tradition by beginning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home from Oxford in 1925 , he won his first seat in the legislature through the influence of a planter . But he was soon attacking the " dictatorship " of the landowners , and when Depression-struck sugar workers rioted in 1937 , Adams was blamed by the governor for inciting the violence . <P> Through the war years , he organized his Barbados Labor Party and Workers ' Union , in 1948 , after suffrage had been broadened , took over the legislature ( the party now holds 15 of 24 seats ) . In 1954 he got the title of Prime Minister , and last year he was knighted . He boasts that " the spirit of feudalism that ruled Barbados is as dead as Queen Anne . " But with 230,000 people jammed onto an island 14 by 21 miles in size , Barbados is still among the poorer areas of the West Indies . Its best hope : relaxation of immigration bars by other islands once federation begins working . Adams will be among the top three men in the dominant Federal Labor Party , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he plans to stick to his local job . " If I went to the federal Parliament , " he says , " I would be betraying Barbados . "
