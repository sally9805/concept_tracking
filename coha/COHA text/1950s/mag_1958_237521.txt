Ever since Red China began baiting its bids for diplomatic recognition with the glittering prospect of trade , some Canadians have shown themselves surprisingly eager to swallow bait , hook and all . Most outspoken of the lot is Toronto 's Globe and Mail , whose publisher . Oakley Dalgleish. recently returned from a tour of the Chinese mainland burbling with admiration for the Peking regime . Last week U.S. diplomats wondered if the pro-Peking line of Dalgleish and his fellow apologists might not be swinging the government in the same direction . <P> After the Chinese Reds began shelling the Nationalist-held island of Quemoy , the Globe and Mail renewed its demands to hand over Quemoy , extend diplomatic recognition and welcome the Chinese Communists into the U.N . The Globe and Mail reprinted three editorials in ads in the New York Times , drew a freshet of letters from both sides of the border , including an approving note in the Times from John Carter Vincent , left-leaning onetime U.S. diplomat who was fired from the State Department in 1953 . <P> By itself , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . More alarming is the possibility that the Ottawa government , prodded by Canadian friends of Red China , might agree , thus shattering the Western front against U.N . recognition of the Reds . It is an open secret in Washington that Prime Minister Diefenbaker has pressed President Eisenhower for a softer policy toward Red China . The State Department was also jolted by Diefenbaker 's hint that Canada might take the initiative to turn the Quemoy crisis over to the U.N . <P> Canada has issued no formal statement of policy , nor has it announced any plans for the coming U.N . General Assembly . Washington hopes that the government recalls some clearheaded remarks delivered in the House of Commons last year : " I think the experience of the United Kingdom , which recognized Communist China prior to the Korean war , has added little to the extension or expansion of trade between that country and Communist China . . . Until such time as the Communist government of China expiates its wrongdoing under international law there certainly will be no justification for the granting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diefenbaker.
