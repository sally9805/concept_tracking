The biggest U.S. rubber company and the world 's biggest tiremaker last week had one of the biggest management shifts in its 60-year history . Into the post of chairman of Akron 's Goodyear Tire &; Rubber Co. ( 1957 sales : $1.4 billion ) stepped Edwin Joel Thomas , 59 , president ( since 1940 ) , chief executive ( since 1956 and longtime protege of Paul Weeks Litchfield , 83 , who became honorary chairman of the board after 58 years with Goodyear . Up to president from executive vice president moved Russel De-Young , 49 , the third president in a row to be tapped from the production ranks . Litchfield , one of the rubber industry 's most indestructible leaders , picked Eddie Thomas out of an Akron high school in 1916 , made him his personal assistant and trained the young mail carrier 's son so thoroughly that in a few years he was delegating responsibilities to him . As Litchfield moved up to the presidency in 1926 , Eddie Thomas also rose , became general superintendent of Goodyear in California and worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the youngest ever chosen by a major rubber company . Together they groomed Russ DeYoung , son of a Rutherford , N.J. carpenter , for the presidency . Both Thomas and DeYoung brush off talk of any basic changes in Goodyear 's policies . As devoted admirers of Litchfield , they say that the policies " P.W . " used to make Goodyear great are good enough for them .
