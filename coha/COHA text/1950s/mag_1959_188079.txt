As Yale 's President A. Whitney Griswold struggled to patch up relations between his students and New Haven cops-askew after last month 's snowball-and-night-stick war ( TIME , March 30 ) - an old grad unkindly recalled some carefree words addressed to a student mob in 1951 , less than a year after Griswold had taken office . Said the president , in the green days of administrative youth : " I love a riot . . . I loved them when I was an undergraduate . . . I can yield to no one the record of smashed light bulbs . . . " <P> Hale as could be on his 85th birthday , salty , shaggy Poet Robert Frost huffed lamely at a birthday cake , tackled the inevitable press conference . " Someone said to me that New England 's in decay , " rasped Frost . " But I said the next President is going to be from Boston . That does n't sound like decay . " Who , he was asked , might that be ? " Ca n't you figure that out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Aha , but did Frost want the boyish Senator to win ? " Anything from Boston is all right with me . " <P> With the will of the late Vincent Astor ( TIME , Feb. 16 ) waiting for probate , the temporary administrators of the estate petitioned Dutchess County , N.Y . surrogate 's court for help on a little problem in part created by Philanthropist Astor 's uncanny financial touch . The request : permission to invest earnings of the mammoth estate ( at least $100 million ) , which is burgeoning at the rate of more than $200,000 a month . <P> Europe-bound aboard the Queen Mary , Negro Cinemactress Dorothy Dandridge , who has finished her chores as Bess in Sam Goldwyn 's forthcoming movie version of Porgy and Bess , hoisted the conventional pretty wave for the flashbulbs on the day of a proud revelation : her engagement to Jack Denison , white proprietor of a Hollywood supper club . <P> In a Boston University dormitory , Freshman John Thomas , 18 , gangly ( 6 ft. 4 in. ) , growing Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) than any other man in recorded athletic history , slammed shut the latticework gate on an upward-bound elevator . When it rose , Thomas ' size 12 left foot was jammed between the car and the shaft walls . Result : severe lacerations and bruises . After surgery , doctors predicted that High Jumper Thomas would be off the sawdust for six to twelve weeks . <P> On a jaunt with Grandmother through an exotic bazaar in Beersheba , Israel , pert , 16-year-old Nina Roosevelt* spied the cutest souvenir ever , begged Grandma to bargain for it with the canny Bedouins . Obligingly , Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt shelled out $77 for a scrawny baby camel ( named " Duchess " by Nina ) , which , if Daddy approves , will stalk the Roosevelts ' Hyde Park estate until it gets big enough to deserve permanent residence in any interested zoo .
