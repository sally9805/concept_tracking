txt Before the Atlantic treaty can formally include Greece , Turkey and the Mediterranean Sea , it must be amended and sent to the Senate for ratification . This will afford the Senators a longoverdue opportunity to consider just what such extensions of our " security " system actually mean . They do-not mean what they seem to mean . that is for sure . The Atlantic pact in its present undistended form is conclusive evidence of that . What the Atlantic pact seemed to mean was that the U. S. national interest was concerned in the fate of certain nations ; it would defend them if attacked . On that basis there could be no overriding objection to the Atlantic pact . The U. S. national interest would be adversely affected if Western Europe were under Communist domination , in the short run if not necessarily in the long run . Still on that'basis , there would be no great objection to extending the pledge to defend Greece and Turkey . Carrying it to the whole Middle East ? which is the destination implied by including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far even on that basis . National interest is all very well , but if you go around defending every nook and cranny of the world you will rapidly find what you are pursuing is not the national interest but its reverse . Korea has given us a taste of that . - But in practice it develops that the pledge to defend if attacked is but the beginning of caur obligations under the Atlantic pact . Understandably enough , nobody wants to be attacked in the first place . So all the places that we have pledged to defend must be made strong , and it is not enough that they be made strong militarily ; everybody knows that you have to have a strong economy to have a strong military . In practice it turns out also that it is the U. S. which must make all these places strong , economically and militarily . The U. S. has spent over S31 billion on foreign aid since World War 11 . If the Administration had its way . that figure would be up to nearly S40 billion in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the Atlantic pact ? in its present unextended form . Why must the U. S. do all this ? There are two interrelated reasons . One is. that foreign nations are convinced that U. S. resources are without limit ; the other is that the U. S. has done nothing convincing to disabuse them of this notion , as the $31 billion figure indicates . So we see that in taking more and more nations into the Atlantic pact , we are vastly increasing this spending commitment , by what astronomical amounts it is impossible presently to imagine . If we simultaneously adopt Governor Dewey 's proposal ? as there is every indication we will , one way or another ? for a " total " Pacific pact . we will sweat under that load from here to eternity ; or , more likely , will be quickly crushed by it . We think the Senators should searchingly examine this fundamental question : Is it in fact in the national interest to undertake to defend every non-Soviet country in the world ? If they decide that it really is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our great Atlantic and Pacific pacts from becoming the more-than-geographical monstrosities they are maturing into . That is to get them back on the original track of the Atlantic pact  --  the pledge to defend if attac ' ? ed . If we must have a Monroe Doctrine for the world . let it be just that , and not a perpetual global subsidy .
