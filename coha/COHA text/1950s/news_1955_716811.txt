txt General of the Army Douglas tonight urged this nation to " now proclaim our readiness to abolish war in concert with the great powers of the world . " " The result would be magical , " he declared . The General rejected preparedness as a sure path to peace , or collective security as a steadfast bulwark of the free world . Abolition of war , as he sees it , need not even rest on international inspection of armaments . Public opinion and the great gains enjoyed by a world of peace would ensure it , in his opinion . The alternative , he warned , was a preparedness race that might plunge the world into nuclear warfare by " spontaneous combustion . " General 's denunciation of war was made in a speech delivered at a banquet sponsored by the Los Angeles American Legion that followed dedication here of a monument in his honor . He came to the West Coast for public ceremonies marking his seventy-fifth anniversary . He touched only briefly on the Far Eastern situation . He made no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope , which he so strongly opposed . Instead , he devoted his address to the suicidal nature of modern nuclear warfare . In ? terms seldom employed by a military hero , General demanded not just a cease-fire , not just coexistence , not just a false peace at ally price , but an absolute end to war itself . General attributed present tensions to two illusions ? belief by the Soviet world that the West is determined to attack them sooner or later , belief by the free world that the Soviets are determined to attack us . " Both are wrong , " he counseled. - He viewed the Far Eastern crisis as a classical development , with a concentrated enemy in a central position deployed against scattered He said Red China faced defeat if it fought in Korea and Indochina at the same time it fought the Chinese Nationalists . So , he continued , the Nationalists were isolated to Formosa , then a cease-fire was arranged in Korea and China was free to tackle Indochina . " Successful there , , the Reds now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " General declared . ' ' As Napoleon Bonaparte once said : ' Give me allies as an enemy so that I can defeat them one by one . ' " Militarily , the situation demonstrates the inherent weakness of the theory of collective security  --  the chain is no stronger 11 than its weakest link , and what is even more vital  --  its full power can only be utilized when all links are brought simultaneously into action . The diverse interests of allies always ' tend towards separation rather than unity . " Whatever betides the ultimate fate of the Far ? gast  --  and indeed of the world  --  will not be settled by force of arms . We may all be practically annihilated  --  but war can no longer be an arbiter of survival . " Earlier today at Park 15,000 persons heard the general denounce the proponents of internationalism and collective security . He spoke ' at ceremonies dedicating the civic monument to him . He urged his wildly cheering audience to repudiate " seductive murmurs * * that patriotism is outmoded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general received an award of extraordinary merit by the Los Angeles Protestant Episcopal diocese . He said in accepting it that nothing has given him more personal satisfaction than his work in restoring religion in Japan . " Though I am of Caesar , I rendered unto God that which was His , " General said . In acknowledging the monument , in which he is depicted in bronze , eight feet tall , the General paid glowing tribute to his comrades in arms . " I and this statue and this park are but the reflected monuments of their grandeur , " he declared . Dressed in blue serge , the Gen'eral spoke in a steady voice , his head shaking slightly . The General and Mrs. , radiant with a bouquet of white orchids given her by the local Filippino community , were ' cheered as they arrivea . They passed through an honor guard from the Forty-seventh Antiaircraft Brigade from Fort , San Pedro . Some in the crowd waved placards reading " Happy Birthday , Mac , " " We Need Mac in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Two old men held up a large sign : " Expose the Men Who Keep Mac out of Washington . " Mrs. , smiling broadly , pulled the strings that drew back the curtains revealing the bronze statue of the General in his familiar informal battle attire , with shirt open at the neck . In the pool in the foreground lay a reproduction of the Pacific islands from Australia to the Philippines that he and his men recaptured during World War II . Gov . Goodwin J. Knight , on behalf of " the twelve and a half million people of California , " extended the official welcome to the General and Mrs. 1 As the General strode from the park , the crowd rushed in , pushing as near as restraining ropes permitted . Many reached out their hands to try and touch him . Then they burst through the ropes and policemen had to lock arms to hold back the crush . Twenty women fainted . The General finally made his way to his scarlet automobile and departed . The ceremonies were held in hazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , but nothing compared to the heavy fog in which the General and his party arrived last night . A crowd of 1,500 waited two hours for his arrival and many thousands lined the route to his hotel .
