OIL &; GAS <P> Barely three years ago the Southwest 's Four Corners area was a 15,000-sq. - mi. wasteland inhabited by Indians , mostly Navajo , whose sheep battled the jackrabbits for meager forage . Last week the mesa-dotted region , where the boundaries of Utah , New Mexico , Arizona and Colorado meet , was the hottest petroleum area in the U.S. Each day El Paso Natural Gas Co. piped more than 600 million cu . ft. of natural gas to the Los Angeles market from 3,000 wells ; other companies piped huge amounts to the Pacific Northwest , Santa Fe , Albuquerque and Los Alamos . Oil company pipelines sent 120,000 bbls. of oil daily to the West Coast and Texas Gulf refineries from some 750 wells in the area . With great finds in San Juan and Paradox Basin , oilmen counted 300 new gas wells put down in the first half of 1958 . They expect another 300 before the year is out . <P> Pockets &; Pipes . The Four Corners oil boom is nothing like an oldtime oil rush . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state governments or Indian tribal councils , and with leases going for as much as $4,308 an acre ( v. $100 or so only two years ago ) , only the biggest companies can afford to gamble . They are there-in force . El Paso Natural Gas built a $750,000 division headquarters to operate the pipeline , has expanded it three times since 1952 . This week or next , Shell Oil moves into a $500,000 headquarters , while Phillips Petroleum , Humble , Superior , Union , Carter , Gulf , Magnolia , Continental , Skelly and half a dozen other majors all have sizable operations . <P> Actually , the industry has known about Four Comers oil for years . The first well was brought in in 1879 . But geologists never thought there was enough to bother with-until the 19505 . Then , hunting gas for the rapidly expanding industries of the Los Angeles area , El Paso Natural Gas moved in . Soon it hit a big gas pocket in the San Juan Basin , built a pipeline to Los Angeles . Within a few years it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intricate that it looked like a page from Gray 's Anatomy . <P> The Reluctant Drillers . The first real oil find came in 1954 . Shell Oil brought in a 1,170-bbl. - daily well at Desert Creek in nearby Utah . But the biggest discovery came in 1956 . The Texas Co. tried to get other companies to come in on a deal to drill in the Aneth section of southeastern Utah , where the lease was about to expire , found no takers , and finally went reluctantly ahead itself . Result : it bored smack into the Aneth pool with estimated reserves of 300 million bbls. , the biggest find since the Williston Basin seven years ago . <P> The great trouble was getting the oil out . Truck and rail costs were so high that Four Corners oil was priced out of the market . To lick the problem , a combine of six companies ( Standard of California , Gulf , Continental , Shell , Richfield and Superior ) formed the Four Corners Pipe Line Co. , spent $50 million for a 16-in. line pumping 70,000 bbls. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Texas-New Mexico Pipe Line Co. , has built another line , with 50,000 bbls. daily capacity , from Aneth field in Utah to Jal , New Mexico , where the oil goes into the Texas Gulf and Midwest markets .
