OF all the slow-moving , detail-bound agencies in Washington 's bureaucracy , the champion is probably the Interstate Commerce Commission , oldest of the Government 's nine independent regulatory bodies . And yet its job is one of the most important . It rules over the destinies of 450 railroads , 20,000 truck lines . 300 freight haulers on inland and coastal waterways , pipelines , terminal companies , etc . Currently , the ICC is in the middle of the fight for the New York Central and has petitions from both sides charging skulduggery . Nobody would be more surprised than the petitioners if the ICC concluded its investigations before the issue is decided by the stockholders in May . <P> To light some boilers under the ICC , the Administration is backing a " time-lag " bill requiring that rate cases before the ICC be decided within 60 days . It is also trying to streamline the ICC by eliminating some of its 15 scattered bureaus . To this end . three bureaus were merged into one last week . And it is pressing for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Johnson . 75 , both for patronage reasons and to put in a younger chairman . So far , Johnson refuses to budge . Actually , Johson is one of the most vigorous and effective men at ICC , within the limitations of the agency 's regulations . He can be outspoken when he thinks the railroads are falling down on the job , but pushes harder than anyone to get rate decisions through when the railroads need them . The big trouble is that the ICC needs more than just a highballing chairman . <P> Employees , steeped by long service in their own bureaucratic traditions , are buried in paper work and time-wasting procedures . They have been doing the same thing the same way for so long that they resist efforts toward a speedup . A 1952 analysis showed that 27.5% of the staff were 60 or older and 37.8% were between 50 and 60 . Says a veteran staffer : " Nobody ever retires from the ICC . Departure is only by death . " <P> All the paper work slows up vital decisions , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ICC now has 560 rate cases pending , some of them filed as far back as 1952 . Moreover , the commission is so scrupulously fair and long-suffering at its hearings that it will hear all witnesses at any length . As a result , shippers and farm lobbies know that they can filibuster a rate increase merely by bringing in more witnesses . Meanwhile , the railroads ' costs have already gone up . Since 1945 , the delay in rate cases has cost the railroads more than $500 million . <P> Part of this is due to the outmoded law under which the ICC operates . One of its original purposes was to protect the public against monopolistic railroad practices . But cars , trucks and planes have brought keen competition to the transport industry , and so have drastically reduced the monopoly dangers and the reason for ICC . Instead of withering away , the ICC is now devoting much of its time to protecting the railroads from themselves . For example , 25% of the time at rate hearings is spent on the effect that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will hurt rail traffic . The railroads would rather do away with such paternalism and let free competition take its course .
