Three weeks ago Christian Democratic Premier Adone Zoli ringingly announced that he would not accept office on the strength of Fascist votes . Last week , in a performance that left even connoisseurs of political agility openmouthed , Zoli announced that he was , after all , prepared to swallow one little Fascist vote . <P> While members of Italy 's Chamber of Deputies listened in hostile silence , Zoli glumly reminded them that it was not his fault that he was Premier of Italy . True to his original promise , he had resigned office just as soon as the tellers finally confirmed that without Fascist support he would have been one vote short of a majority ( TIME , June 17 ) . But when President Giovanni Gronchi , unable to find anyone else , coolly declared that Zoli was still Premier , " I felt , " burbled Zoli into the silence , " that I had to accede to so high an authority . " So ended Italy 's longest political crisis ( 52 days ) since the one that preceded Mussolini 's accession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government is not a solution to crisis , but merely a manifestation of it . "
