Everett Franklin Spruce , 48 , is the other kind of painter . He did not spend his youth in the ateliers of Montparnasse and the arms of his models . Nor did he return wearing beard and beret . The measure of his distance from the conventional unconventional background is that he is a respectable father of four , a full professor of art , and a citizen of Texas . For the past 30 years Professor Spruce has been celebrating the flora and fauna of Texas in imaginative oils laid on with a realistic brush . Now the University of Texas is publishing an annual full-color portfolio of the works of artists portraying the Southwest . Its first choice , picked by a blue-ribbon committee of leading Texas art patrons advised by the state 's most prominent art-museum directors : stocky , sobersided Everett Spruce . <P> The accolade was not his first . Before being selected over all regional competitors , including Dallas ' Otis Dozier ( TIME , Dec. 17 ) , Painter Spruce had won recognition nationally ( the Scheidt Memorial Prize , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the first prize at an exhibition of American paintings in Brussels . <P> Painting began for Spruce in back-country Arkansas with local landscapes , rabbit hunters and deer . He went to a rural Arkansas school , did farm chores , picking apples and digging sweet potatoes , soon won a county competition with his first watercolors and oils . At 18 he went to the Dallas Art Institute on a scholarship . There he studied life drawing and painting , made ends meet by doubling as school janitor and fabricator of canvases and panels that the school sold to its students . Eventually he became assistant director of the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts , now teaches at the University of Texas in Austin . At any time he is apt to load his family into a battered station wagon with palette and easel and take to the hills or the canyons of the Big Bend . A prolific painter , Spruce takes only a couple of days to complete a canvas , sells his paintings at $1,000 and up . <P> Spruce feels no sense of restriction because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes that " it 's important for the artist to have roots , " and that " his duty is to communicate . " Contrasting the painting in the East and in Texas , which Texans are trying to boost as one of the principal art centers in the U.S. , Spruce says : " It is important that a painting at least represent something that is understandable . An artist can be very personal , as I am , and very imaginative and still deal with the intelligibly visible world . Some artists who live in the East get themselves into a kind of prison of form and expression . In Texas I have been free to do the work I like . I 'm not bound . "
