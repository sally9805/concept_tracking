Argentine Dictator Juan Peron has long had a simple answer to foreign publications that report unfavorable news about him and his administration : he banned them . Six years ago he banned TIME from Argentina , followed up by gradually banning 15 other U.S. magazines- and , this year , the New York Times . This week , in another move to patch up strained relations with the U.S. , Peron changed front . As part of his program to present a friendlier face to the U.S. , the post office " unofficially " announced that the banned U.S. periodicals will be allowed to enter Argentina again . ( The ban on the New York Times was lifted early last month . ) This week the first banned magazines were shipped into Argentina . Nevertheless . U.S. publishers still did not know whether Peron would permit them to take the money from sales out of Argentina ; for most of the time before the ban , publishers were forced either to leave their money in Argentina or exchange pesos for dollars at undercut rates . <P> <P> - LIFE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post , Vision , U.S. News &; World Report , U.N .
