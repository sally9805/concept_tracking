Space flight enthusiasts talk confidently about trips to the moon , but so far no rocket , even an unmanned one , has climbed more than 0.25% of the distance-about 600 miles , unofficially credited to the Lockheed X17 . The first vehicle to make a really big stride into space will probably be a cheap , unstreamlined , unglamorous , four-stage job assembled out of familiar rocket hardware by Aeronutronic Systems , Inc. , a Ford Motor Co. subsidiary at Glendale , Calif . Its gimmick : it will start at 100,000 ft. from a balloon . <P> <P> Battling Air . When rockets are fired from the earth 's surface , they can not start fast . If they move too fast too soon , the dense , low-altitude air battles back ferociously , wasting the rocket 's fuel and heating the structure to the disaster point . But slow starting has disadvantages too . Rocket motors are less efficient at slow speed , and a slow-starting vehicle wastes energy because it has to carry the fuel it needs for later acceleration to high altitude against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force to design an extreme high-altitude research vehicle , Aeronutronic rocketeers concluded that if the vehicle could be lifted above the densest part of the stratosphere before it was fired , they could get the advantages of high-speed starting without the disadvantages of drag and heat . They got in touch with General Mills , Inc. , which had developed enormous balloons of polyethylene film , asked if the company could design a balloon that could serve as a launching platform . General Mills could , and did . <P> Aeronutronic 's rocket , named Far Side , lacks the streamlined style of surface-starting rockets . Its first stage is a cluster of four Recruit solid-propellant rocket motors , made by Thiokol Chemical Corp . at Elkton , Md. , each with 40,000 lbs . of thrust . Stage Two is a single Recruit . Stage Three is four clustered Arrow II rockets ( thrust : 250 lbs . each ) . The last stage is a single Arrow II which pushes the payload-a tube containing 3.5 lbs . of instruments-to final speed . The whole assembly looks like a graceless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4,000 Miles Up . Hanging nose-up below its balloon , Far Side will be lifted nearly 19 miles above the earth , where the air has one-hundredth the density of sea-level air . A radio signal from the ground will set an igniting system in motion . The four Stage One Recruits will roar into life , concentrating their 160,000 lbs . of thrust on the small rocket and snapping it upward with 70 g. of acceleration . It will shoot through the filmy balloon as if it were not there . The first stage fuel will be burned in 1.5 sec. , giving Far Side a speed of 3,500 m.p.h . Stage Two , igniting a few seconds after the separation of Stage One , will double the speed . Stage Three will raise it to 11,000 m.p.h. , and finally Stage Four will fire . When it burns out at 75 miles above the earth , Far Side will be climbing at about 18,000 m.p.h. , and it will not stop until it has climbed 4,000 miles . When it falls back , the friction of the atmosphere will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth .
