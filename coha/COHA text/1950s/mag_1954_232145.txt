" The cow , " wrote Mahatma Gandhi , " is the mother to millions of Indian mankind . She is a poem of pity . " By tradition and training , many another devout Hindu through the centuries had assumed the same attitude toward the beasts who roam India 's city streets and country lanes by the millions . It is a statutory crime in India to kill a cow . In 1944 a high-caste Hindu , who accidentally let one of his own cows strangle herself , was forced to roam the streets for three days with a halter around his neck , mooing for food and forgiveness . <P> In recent years , the increasingly modern-minded Hindu has begun to look with less favor on his sacred cattle . The " dedicated bulls , " which from time immemorial have been set free to roam the country as walking memorials to dead Hindus , are no longer of carefully selected , high-breed ( Brahman ) stock as they once were , but more often cheap , scrub calfs with little breeding and less manners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set free by their owners each day to filch and pillage in other men 's gardens , garbage cans and vegetable stalls before returning home at night to be milked . <P> Last week , casting sentiment to the winds , the city fathers of New Delhi took action at last against the 4,000-odd free cows and bulls at large in their city . A task force of 100 picked cow catchers , armed with ropes and long poles , gathered each night at dusk near the municipal post office for briefing . In deep secrecy , lest the cow owners foil their plans , the posses deployed to strategic spots in the city , blocking off the ends of streets and side alleys . Their main idea was to trap the vagrants and drive them into a temporary pound , but time and again the cornered cows would charge their pursuers and escape , frightening the wits and the sleep out of many Delhi citizens dozing in cots on the streets . When finally trapped , the cows would lie down and 8 or 10 people would have to roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , working against odds , Delhi 's cow catchers had rounded up 500 cows for shipment to a 2,000-acre government cow home in the Himalayan foothills ( unless their owners chose to claim them and pay a fine ) . This week they plan to go to work on the city 's bulls .
