For a man who had come all the way from Europe to play one Manhattan concert , Harpist Nicanor Zabaleta had cause to be disheartened . As one of the finest harpists in the world , he could be sure of an eager audience-but equally sure that not a single kind word would appear about him next day : with the town 's newspapers shut down ( see PRESS ) , the music critics of the dailies had no way of raising a cheer . <P> Zabaleta rippled out a notable program anyhow . Instead of the usual keyboard music arranged for the harp , he played nothing that was not written specifically for his instrument . Instead of misty sound effects and undulating glissandos that have become a trademark of harp performances , he played clean-cut melody and counterpoint . High point : Hindemith 's Sonata ( 1939 ) , with its ear-twisting harmonies and Celtic echoes . <P> At 46 , Zabaleta is too well established to suffer from the silence of the Manhattan press . Basque-born ( he now makes his home in Puerto Rico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven , a recitalist since 22 . After early successes in Europe , he turned to Latin America , and has made more than 1,000 appearances there , but only after an interval of bad luck : he had barely started when he caught a fungus infection in his fingers . For four years he was limited to teaching ( in the Caracas conservatory ) . But " I do not have the teacher 's mentality , " he says , and he went back to the stage as soon as he could . <P> Since there was little available music for solo harp and he has " no ability for composing " either , Zabaleta decided that he must uncover music written for the harp rather than resort to arrangements . For a year and a half he searched the libraries of Europe , turned up some surprising finds , e.g. , harp music by one of Bach 's sons , by Beethoven , Handel and Faure , as well as by early Spanish and French composers . That still left one gap : the moderns . To fill it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harp . So far , six concertos have been dedicated to him , including compositions by Milhaud and Villa-Lobos . <P> Next after his recital , Harpist Zabaleta will make a record ( for Esoteric ) , then load his harp into an airplane and take off for a month-long Caribbean concert tour . After that he heads for more recitals in the U.S. Northwest and Alaska . <P> Other musicians suffered more seriously from Manhattan 's newspaper strike . Among them : 66-year-old Roland Hayes , famed Negro tenor , who returned to a half-filled Carnegie Hall for his 30th anniversary concert and was greeted by a standing ovation ; promising Latvian Pianist Herman Codes , 32 , making his New York debut ; and Negro Soprano Georgia Laster , 27 , whose Town Hall recital was her prize as a winner of the Naumburg Musical Foundation contest .
