A Date with Judy ( Sat . 11:30 a.m. , ABC-TV ) transforms another just-folks radio family into a daytime TV show . The Fosters come equipped with a whimsical father , a lovable but levelheaded Mom , and a lackwit , adolescent son , all working as background for daughter Judy ( Pat Crowley ) . The plot throws Judy in love with an oaf named Oogie , supplies her with boundless opportunities to pout , indulge in temper tantrums and end nearly every scene in a drugstore , where a finger-pointing clerk urges viewers to stock up on Sponsor McKesson &; Robbins ' products . <P> Queens of America ( Sat . 9 p.m. , ABC-TV ) adds women baseball players to the TV ranks of women roller skaters and women wrestlers . The Queens are a softball team decoratively turned out in shirts , shorts and knee-length stockings ; their opponents bear such names as the Checashers , the Bluebirds and the Music Maids . The caliber of play is a good deal better than the camerawork and announcing .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
