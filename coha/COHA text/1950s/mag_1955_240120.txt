When 17-year-old Yasujiro Aoki was told that he had leprosy , he did what a devout Buddhist should . Dressed in white robes and carrying a walking stick , he made a lengthy pilgrimage to the 88 holy places of Buddhism on his native Japanese island of Shikoku , visiting each three times . But at the end of the last lap , having found no cure , he did what a devout Buddhist should not : he turned in at the gate of an Anglican missionary hospital . <P> There , although he stayed ten years , he found no cure , but he found a cause . He became a lay missionary in the Anglican Church in Japan and devoted himself to helping other leprosy victims . In March 1927 , at the age of 35 , he made his way to jungle-like Motobu Peninsula on northern Okinawa because he had heard fearful tales of the misery of Okinawa 's leprosy sufferers . <P> Religion Spurned . He could hardly have picked a more difficult place for his labors . The last missionary who had tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meddling . When Aoki arrived , the afflicted were either kept hidden by their families or left on the beaches to starve . Many of them managed to live by creeping into stores , threatening to touch the goods on display unless the storekeeper paid them off with food . <P> Aoki made his headquarters in a cave by the ocean , secretly began rounding up his fellow sufferers and taking them back to his peninsula . There , unnoticed by the islanders , they built crude shelters and lived on food that Aoki bought with his slim funds . His recruits at first spurned his religion , since by Okinawan tradition leprosy was considered an evidence of evil , on the part of either the sufferer or his ancestors . Aoki countered by reciting Christ 's absolution of the blind man : " Neither hath this man sinned , nor his parents : but that the works of God should be made manifest in him ( John 9:3 ) .

Then an enterprising newspaper printed a story about Aoki 's work , and nearby farmers marched on the colony , pulled the huts down with ropes ( they were afraid to touch the boards ) and burned them . Aoki 's small band got until sundown to get off Okinawa . They fled by boat to an uninhabited island off the coast to start all over again . <P> Undaunted . Aoki slipped back to Okinawa , used intermediaries to buy up a wooded island called Yagaji , just off the peninsula shore . Two wealthy Japanese Christians donated money to build a central hall and two dormitories . A new colony , called Airaku-en ( Garden of the Haven of Love ) was started , and Aoki became its manager . The following year the Japanese government decided to use Aoki 's site for its leprosarium , built a hospital and several other buildings . The colony 's population jumped from 42 to 242 , and some blamed Aoki for the government 's brutally efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beatings and having my house burned down , because I had faith in my work , " said Aoki .
