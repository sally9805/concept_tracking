IN the hammock and half out of it , Andrew tortured a beetle in the grass and fretfully murmured obscenities . A squirrel sassed him from the crotch of the tulip tree and Beth , three feet away , insolently sat with her back to him . Nothing could make him feel worse , when he was feeling bad to start with , than the insult of a cat . He hated them all , and most of all he hated this black bug whose legs he slowly amputated . Between the dirty words , he talked as he worked to an imaginary twin who sat on the grass at the base of the tree . This interested and adventitious homunculus , although it was his twin , was , nevertheless , much younger than he and surpassingly ignorant . " When I have finished killing Charles , I 'll take you downtown , " he said to it . " How would you like to eatp99an alewife at the smoke-house ? What is an alewife ? Why , it 's a sort of herring . Okay , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be about the only chance I 'll have because day after tomorrow , I 'll be too busy to bother with you . " " You mean because day after tomorrow you 're going eeling with Victor ? " asked the twin . " Eeling ! " he exclaimed . " My God , you do n't know anything , do you ? Do you think I 'd catch an eel on purpose ? " The poor kid quickly changed the subject . " When will the funeral be ? " he asked . " Ten in the morning probably , " replied Andrew . " Depending on the tide . " " Why depending on the tide ? " " Because we have to go clamming right afterward . " It was mid-morning but the dew was not yet dry in the shade of the elms ; drops of it depended like beads from a spider web that was strung from tree to tree . Andrew had been awake since daybreak , stirred out of sleep by two wrens that had held a shrill colloquy in the vine over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the strong , fresh breeze on his face , he had seen his cousin 's lamp go off . For a moment he was so thrilled to think of the two of them awake in the sleeping house at five in the morning that he had thought of knocking on her door and asking her to go for a swim . But he knew that the lake would be cold and anyhow , there was something too intimate and isolatedabout this hour of the day ; alone with her in thep100aboriginal morning with nothing else to distract her , she might read his criminal mind . She had not come down to the dining room while he and the twins were eating their breakfast and her tray , which usually went up at half past seven , had not gone up by the time he left the house at nearly nine . There was a funny feeling in the house ; the maids and the twins were quiet , and no one seemed able to settle down to anything . It was alwaysthat way whenever Cousin Katharine 's routine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all night , " he told his twin . " All night long she was reading my mind . " " Maybe she just turned on the light for a minute , " suggested the twin . " Listen , " he said to this impudent Doubting Thomas , " listen to me . I 'm boss around here . I said Cousin Katharine stayed up all night and that 's what she did , no ifs , buts or maybes . " The twin blubbered at the scolding and more kindly Andrew said , " Come on , half-pint . Charles Smithwicked is deader than a door-nail . " He had decided to go down to the village because of something Harriet had said the night before when they were playing three-handed bridge . She had said he should be ashamed of himself for behaving like a baby ; he could n't fool her , she said , he was n't reading in the hammock , he was n't doing anything but pretendingit was a cradle ; she thought that anyone should have more pride than to advertise to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources . He hadp101flung down his cards and told her to go to hell . But she was right and he was ashamed and all night long he had pitched and tossed and pummeled his pillow and deranged the bedding . It took great courage to leave the hammock and to expose himself to the town ; his mouth was as dry and his heart was as erratic as it always was when he had to be in any kind of play or exhibition . It was like a dream of going to school in his underwear . But he steeled himself ; he got up , full of determination . To Honor who called out from the drawing room to ask him where he was going , he replied , " I 've got some errands to run downstreet . " She saved his life then , for in fact he had no errands at all but she asked him to take the morning letters to the post office . There were five altogether , the three they had written to their parents ( Andrew , having nothing to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health of the animals , all of whom were well ) and two in Cousin Katharine 's hand , one to the Shipleys and the other to Aunt Alma . When he was out of sight of the house , he held these last two up to the light but the letter paper was thick and he could not make out a word ; he would have given much to know what she had written about him . He idled down the road and through the town , keepingup appearances by smiling to himself and , from time to time , if he passed anyone , faking a chuckle . He paused to look at an unfamiliar skiff tied up at the small pier and to speculate on its owner and its purpose and to deduce that it had sailed in from Bingham Bayp102on the early wind . It occurred to him to board it and get a lift to the docks to hunt for Congreve Smithwick and reclaim his knife with which to cut out Charles 's heart ; but for all he knew the man was out on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with white houses , each with a picket fence , a square of lawn or a spring garden , a pair of lilac bushes , this road was as familiar to him as his own face and so pleasing were his sensationsas he walked along it that for the time being he took heart and was happy and independent . To the ignorant little wraith beside him , he made much of the stock rural-joke Christian names on the letter boxes , Silas , Reuben , Hiram ( he found them marvelous , not in the least comic , exactly as he would have found it marvelous and reassuring to know a colored man named Rastus , a dog named Fido , a cat named Tom ) , stopped dead still to gather and remember smells , smells of skunks , of tar , of some late riser 's percolating coffee , of peonies , weigela , salt air , wood smoke . He and Victor had always felt it their right to look through open doors and windows and he did so now , frankly stood and stared at women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shelling peas ; at an old man , infirm and useless , rocking himself to sleep in a Boston rocker as gently as if he were a mother and a baby in the same person and then jerking suddenlyawake at a sound or the intrusion of the sun . He examined the packages on top of the letter boxes , read the addresses of the senders , applauded or deplored the knots in the string . Now and again he opened a letterp103box itself and diligently and with no interest at all read the postal cards and quickly leafed through the sale catalogues from Montgomery Ward , bridling with indignation at the pictures of corsets . Eventually he came to the fish run , a complicated conduit a few hundred yards below the crescent headtidewhere every spring the alewives left the river to spawn in the fresh water of the lake above . He stood on a plank over the canal for a while and watched the obdurate fish that progressed by fractions upstream through the fast-moving water , or simply held their place for seeming hours , with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the smoke-house came a strong and putrid reek which , on windy days , penetrated to the outskirts of the town ; Cousin Katharine , at such times , closed all the doors and windows and went from room to room carrying a long burning joss stick high over her head . The smoked alewives which were bony and tasteless  --  until age impartedto them an unintentional pungency  --  and had a skin like yellow isinglass , were shipped to Haiti where , it was said , they were considered a delicacy , a fact that had led the cynical manager of the run to observe that he would not " care to sample their home-grown carrion . " Once Charles Smithwick 's ship had called at Portau-Princeand on the back of a view of the Citadel , he had written that he had bought a Hawthorne alewife and that eating it had made him " ( home ) sick . " Oh , that Charles was a wit all right , all right.  | " He 's a wit in a pig 's valise , " snarled Andrew 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it had always been a part of his and Victor 's ritualistic day , Andrew begged a fish from one of the men and in the fuming shed he ate the woody , salty flesh in flakes ; they were as dry as pine shavings . The genial , stinking man , pausingto wipe his sweaty face , smiled down at Andrew and said , " I suppose you and your side-kick have been too busy listening to Charley Smithwick 's tall tales to come and see your old friends . " Andrew was amazed ; he had thought the whole town knew that he and Victor were not speaking . He said " Yes , " but he dared not elaborate lest the lie be discovered and he become really the laughingstock , and as soon as he decently could , he sped from the smoke-house and went to the general store where , with urgent thirst , he drank a bottle of tepid raspberry tonic . There in the cool of the vast room , partitioned into aisles with cases of notions and shoes and graniteware kitchen pots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time yesterday . There had been a fire in a henhouse and you should have smelled the feathers ! And a breaking-and-entering , a motorcycle accident on Route One ; a boat had capsized in the harbor at BinghamBay ; a ventriloquist named Theophilus Sabatini had come to town and would be heard nightly after the first showing of the movie . Charles Smithwick had gained five pounds in the last week ; Mr. Breyfogle was out of green split peas but he had plenty of the yellow.  |p105The  martial Miss Duff , barking out orders to Mr. Breyfogle for dried apricots as if she were requisitioningammunition , turned and pointed her finger at Andrewlike the man in the Moxie ad , " Is your cousin sick ? " she demanded . He choked on a swallow of tonic and shook his head . " Her light was on all night , " she accused . " I know because a damned rat kept me awake myself . " " You ought to try this here new Rightaway Rataway , ' " said Mr. Breyfogle . He had a long pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rat himself . " Ought to try a shotgun , " said Miss Duff , " and would if the damned outlaws were n't so wily . " " Did you say Kate was sick ? " asked Mrs. WainrightLowebustling up from the back of the store where she had been pawing a bin of new potatoes like a ragpicker . Mrs. Wainright-Lowe was a grass widow and she was fond of trouble . Mr. Wainright-Lowe had , for all practical purposes , vanished off the face of the globe though there was a rumor that he was living in Tibet and another that he had settled down in peaceful bigamyin Omaha . She lived with her elderly bachelor son who called her Mumma . Putting upon her round , smalleyedface a look of sympathy transparently malicious , she said , " You do n't suppose she ate something at your house last night that poisoned her , do you , Peg ? " " If she did , she brought it herself . " " Oh , I would n't be so sure of that , " returned Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they say . As a matter of fact , Brantley and I both remarked that we felt a little under the weather this morning . I was n't going to mention it to you but since Katharine is sick . . . " " Rats , " said Miss Duff and turned back to Mr. Brey-f ogle who , evidently under the impression that she was speaking of her own rats , held out for her inspection a can of Rightaway Rataway . The whole town seemed to know that Katharine Congreve 's light had been on till morning and everyone was wholeheartedly interested . The occupants of the summer houses of Hawthorne , whose chimneys smoked from just after thaw until the first frost , greeted Andrew one by one with solicitous inquiries as they sauntered or bustled , according to their humour , into the store and later when he sat on the porch , petting Miss Duff 's beagles . It gave him a vicarous importance and he was careful not to deny or affirm any of the hypotheses that the ladies and gentlemen proposed ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it but was not at liberty to tell . Between interviews , he dropped his role and studied the matter analytically , but he came to no conclusions ; he could not imagine what on earth she had been doing and he did not believe she had been sick ; Cousin Katharine was above sickness except for flu occasionally when there was an epidemic . " Perhaps she had a guest , " suggested Mrs. Tyler . Miss Duff exploded with outrage , " The light was upstairs . " They were standing just inside the door and evidentlyp107Mrs . Tyler caught sight of Andrew for she hastily amended , " I meant a guest of the animal kingdom . My rats and squirrels often give me insomnia . " " Do n't talk to me about rats ! " roared Miss Duff . " They 're driving me stark staring mad . " They moved out of earshot of Katharine Congreve 's relative but he could see that they , together with Mrs. Wainright-Lowe , were continuing the conversation avidly . Now he watched the deliberate approach of old Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy and others , because he had nothing else to do ) as he took his two-hour constitutional , covering the whole of the little town , his choleric Negro valet following a few steps behind , armed with an umbrella if it should rain and a palm-leaf fan if Mr. Barker should have one of his attacks of vertigo . He waved his stick at Andrew and called out , " I hear your daddy 's yacht came into Bingham Bay last night , and I also hear that our own Empress Katharine is indisposed . Convey to her my distressful solicitude and beg her to call on me , her humble servant , if there is anything her heart desires . " He laughed , taking none of his speech seriously . " It 's my personal opinion , " he shouted , cuppinghis hand to his mouth in a stage gesture , " that she was up all night reading Gone with the Wind though she would never own up to it . " Miss Celia Heminwayt speeding to the post office in her wheel-chair , on hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Speak for yourself , Rodney . The trash you read ! " He continued to sit on the porch , his back against a tall milk can , knowing that he was the cynosure that morning of every eye . Aloof and smiling enigmatically , he watched as much as he was watched ; he watched the parade of summer people whom Victor , even though he had known them all his life , looked on as sui generic , " the people from away , " and watched the town 's indigenousfreaks and skeletons whom Victor did not find odd at all but who comprised a gallery so unusual , small as it was , that on the two or three occasions Andrewhad described its members to boys at Sewell , no one had believed him . Every single person indicated in one way or another that his rich and beautiful maiden cousin had not gone to bed till morning . The French Canadian game warden of great age and rumored lunacy ( he sometimes thought he was General Pershing and tried to drill the trusties when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputed to be raising snakes , came riding his skinny brown mare down from the headtide for his weekly purchase of provisions ; he had a reckless greed for macaroni , thereby earning for himself the nickname Yankee Doodle . As long-legged and as lean as . his horse , he loped up the steps and Andrew could have sworn as he passed by , that he caught the fishy smell of snakes . He looked at Andrew with his crazy , batting eyes and he said , " Tell her to try a spoonful of honey in a glass ofp109gin . " Behind him , Miss Duff made a sound as if she were throwing up . There was a vile old beggar woman known as Em Bugtown who sometimes wandered away from the county farm at the.edge of town and went from door to door asking for food or snuff or silver spoons ; it was said that she had been beautiful , been rich , been  --  despiteall this  --  jilted by her fiance and then , defying everyone who loved her , had turned to dipping snuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come driftinglike a hobo up from New York and finally had settledhere , an eyesore when she was abroad , a burden to the taxpayers when she stayed put . She smelled of onions and she wore a yellow rag , limp with Musterole , on the back of her neck to alleviate the headache she had had ever since her lover disappeared . Early this summer she had come to Congreve House and had hammered loudly at the spotless door and when Mrs. Shea came to shoo her off , she planted herself solidly on the front lawn , bony arms akimbo , and shouted , " Hark , Lady Congreve ! You 'll pay for your black sins . " Cousin Katharine laughed but she turned a little pale and said that it did not seem fair to be so threatenedsimply because she would not part with her coin silver teaspoons that had been in the family time out of mind . But Cousin Katharine , who had never borne anyone a grudge , did not fail , when she made her weekly visit to the poorhouse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old wretch some tins of snuff and packages of cigarettes nor to talk to herp110for a quarter of an hour . " Miss Bugtown and I , " said Cousin Katherine , " according to Miss Bugtown , are in the same boat . She asked me whether I got the go-by ' by letter or by mouth and when I told her both ' I thought for a minute she was going to hug me . " This morning Em Bugtown came ranging down the hill in a huge pair of sneakers , busily munching her toothless gums . " Pick up your feet , Em Bugtown ! " cried Andrew , for it was this injunction that Victor used to make her swear . She halted , peering this way and that to find the source of the voice , her mouth still browsing greedilyover itself . Seeing Andrew finally , she took a stance in the middle of the road , her feet far apart and she shook both fists at him ; from her ribby lips there came a stream of words so venomous and nasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck erupted into gooseflesh . When she had finished with her imprecations , she became malevolently unctuous and actually rubbing her twiggy hands together she said with a smirk , " You do n't go scot-free for robbing the poor and defrauding the helpless , do you , dear ? Did n't go to bed at all last night ? But I , for one , am truly sorry for her . " Hummingvillainously , she moved on in the direction of Mr. Barker 's house undoubtedly to ask for spoons . He saw the man with one diminutive ear ( it was no bigger than a clove of tangerine and Andrew would have given both his normal ones for it ) and the man without a nose but only a great bandage where it should have been ; and Jasper , the epileptic ; and the fabulouslyp111corpulent Bluebell James who had had a bastard baby every year since she was twelve . Every one of them spoke to him and tried to seem casual when they asked after Miss Congreve . Not the least interesting of these autochthons was Beulah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future and disclose the past in a pack of filthy playing cards or a pattern of wet tea-leaves . She came to town at a trot every morning , carrying a covered basket in which she put her small supplies of two eggs , four potatoes , half a pound of pork liver , a loaf of bread , which she left then in the cold-room of the house where she was sewing that day until it was time for her to trot home . She loitered a little in the streets  --  yet seemed to skip note . It was Andrew 's sisters ' fancy that Beulah and Yankee Doodle Lafontaine were married but very secretly and that they practiced black magic with the snakes and the tea-leaves . One year , when a band of gypsies came in the heart of summer and through the bird-watching binoculars , Honor and Harrietand Andrew had spied on the fat little women sidlingin and out of Beulah 's cottage on what errands they did not dare imagine , Honor had sworn that one of them had given her the evil eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in hives and she would not be persuaded that they had come from eating wild strawberries in the woods ; she spoke of " the time Beulah 's house-guest hexed me . " Beulah worep112a ruffled mobcap and winter and summer , rain and shine , around her neck , there slackly hung a many-tailed fur tippet the color of a mouse . " How come your mother wears fur in the summer ? " Andrew once had asked Victor and Victor , shrugging his shoulders , countered , " How come your lady cousin rides around in that oldtimewhatsis ? " Remembering that , Andrew turned his face away from the street and gazed into a stand of pine trees on the far bank of the river , carried again into the past in spite of the potentialities of this morning 's mystery . For one of the most puzzling aspects of Victor 's snub was that next to his brother , he had admired Cousin Katharinemore than anyone else in the world and Andrew had never deceived himself that it was partly because of his kinship to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were meeting secretly ( anything was possible in this unpropitious year ) he had ignored her as completely as he had ignored Andrew . It was true that he had seldom come nearer to Congreve House than the kitchen garden except during a party , but all the same , he knew the interior of it as intimately as Andrew did for , making no bones about it , he toured it in the winter when it was shut up except for the kitchen and the two bedrooms where Maddox and Mrs. Shea slept . Similarly he entered all the boarded-up , dust-sheeted summer houses , inspecting them methodically and uncritically . He said that if one kept " a sharp look out " it was possible to learn everything there was to know about a person just through his belongings . In speakingp113of Mr. Barker 's house , he once had said , " I think it 's funny for a man to keep a box of cowbells under his bed . " His eye had wandered as he contemplated this vagary and then , " I bet he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his man , " a hypothesis that was very likely true since Mr. Barker , who was many times a millionaire , had long ago been threatened by black-hand letters , presumably from a band of kidnappers . He had immediately retired for protection to a private sanitarium for nervous complaints , where through a gross misjudgement or a snarl of red tape , he had been put into the violent ward . He admitted freely that ever since , he had had horrifying nightmares in which the kidnappers and the psychiatrists pursued him in gyroscopes . And speaking once of Cousin Katharine 's house , Victorsaid , " I figure she keeps those spriggy shoes in the china closet to remember something by . I figure she wore them on some red-letter day or other , but I have n't figured out yet why there are two sets . " The " china closet " was a bibelot cabinet in the upstairs sitting room and the " spriggy shoes " had been worn by Cousin Katharineand Andrew 's mother at a ball he had often heard about . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's funny to keep a keepsake for getting twotimed . " But when Andrew demanded an explanation of this cryptic statement , Victor said only that he had been joking . Another time , he said , " You know last winter when I was in your house ? I found out something . I found out why she never got married . " Andp114then , when Andrew asked why , Victor stood on his head and upside down , in a strangled voice , brushed him off . " April Fool , " he gurgled . " I found a mice nest in a hat of hers , that 's what I found . " Beulah Smithwick was a woman to whom gossip came unsolicited and copiously like particles of iron to a magnet and who , though she was trustworthy with confidences , enjoyed holding character up to a strong light . Like all inveterate gossips , she claimed she did not gossip at all but that she had only a friendly curiosity to know " what made people tick . " And it could be assumed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time the erratic telephone was out of order , she used her son as her sounding board and interlocutor so that it was natural that his mind had been sophisticated early and natural that he should know as much and even more about Cousin Katharine than Andrew did . For she had known Miss Congreve from childhood since she had been a maid in the house , twelve years old , when the infant Katharine had been brought up for her first summer in Hawthorne . Through the crude country boy , Andrew had learned that his cousin 's gilded cradle had been made in the shape of a shell and had been lined with pale pink China silk ; her frocks and bonnetsand peignoirs had come from Paris and so had her saucy nanny who taught her to say " ma bonne " before she said Mama or Papa . Beulah had watched her gorgeously unfold , emerge magnificently from her adorable chrysalis . And Beulah had , moreover , watched Maeve Maxwell grow from a thin and tearful littlep115orphan into a woman nearly as confident and nearly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's recollections , spoke of Andrew 's mother , Andrew was at once excitedand discomforted : it was like a double vision or like a dream within a dream . As if he spoke of someonehe had read about or someone he knew and Andrew did not , he would say , " She and the other one . . . " ( and by " the other one , " he meant Andrew 's own mother ) . " She and the other one took off one night in the middle of the night and rode horseback to Bingham and stowed away on a tuna boat . They found them before they got past the lighthouse but  --  " and now he quoted his mother verbatim and his voice even partookof her screeching timbre  --  " it was a scandal that rocked our town . " Then , speaking for himself again he added , bored , " Nothing happened , though . " At such times , Andrew felt like an immigrant to a country where he spoke the language brokenly but had excellent connections . He thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew 's relation to her , how he had questioned him on the interior of her house in Boston and had been delighted to know that she had a chemical laboratory in the basement where she had once successfully made gunpowder . His cat-eyes widened and his mouth hung open in fascination when her name was mentioned or when he saw her , tall , white-haired , dressed in her lovely clothes , her flowing cloaks and her Spanish shawls , her broad hats and her veils . He liked to seep116her going past in her carriage for her afternoon drive , bowing and smiling like a public personage on her way to pay visits of half an hour or to leave her card together with one of the small mementoes she always carried with her in a rattan basket , sprigs of lavender , spills of colored paper , dried morels . She greeted everyoneshe met by name and by her friendly questions , to do with a sick child or the progress of a new wing on a house or the loss of a dinghy or the preparations for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors were her concerns . When Victor called her " ma'am " he sounded as if he were addressing a queen and sometimes , forgetting his manners , he stared at her , dumb and spellbound . He was rigid at the lawn parties , the midday picnics , the strawberry teas and the evening fetes with dancing round a maypole garlanded with roses . And while she organizedthe other children into games of blindman 's buff and snipsnapsnorum , he stood apart , unwilling to be distracted from his contemplation of her . And while she fed the others to repletion with profiteroles and lemonade , he could not eat . Once , though , he had agreed to join in a game of post office which Cousin Katharine herself had organized and he had got a special delivery letter from his hostess and had been required to go with her to the writing room off the library , the " privy chamber , " as she called it , a term that made the country children blush and squirm with giggles . And here , behind the damask portieres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of surprise when he came out had im/parted to his hodgepodge face an unbelievable dignity which had stilled the tongues of the others who had been on the point of teasing him . He had stalked directly to the finches ' cage over the terrarium and Andrew had seen him put his lips to the grating as if he hoped the birds would permanently tattoo the kiss on his lips with their sharp beaks . Ever since that time , however , he had shunned even post office and he stood speechless on the sidelines , unable to participate in anything although , because the etiquette his mother had schooled him in demanded it , he would stand on his head , he would even yodel briefly if Miss Congreve asked him to . Cousin Katharine had not had a single party this summer , not for children and not for ancients . Andrew had not thought of that before but now that he did , he could only come to the conclusion that there was something wrong with her . " Something is rotten in the state of Denmark , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beulah Smithwick fluttered up the steps and shrilled at him , " What 's this about my darling lady being sick ? Say it is n't so . " " It is n't , " he said and on an inspiration he added , " She was up all night cutting out paper dolls . " " Cutting out paper dolls ? " Mrs. Wainright-Lowe inquiredwith great interest through the screen door . " I think you 're mistaken , Andrew . I think Miss Duff 's hot crabmeat hors d'oeuvre gave her an upset . " Beulah flicked through the tails of her tippet and underliningevery word she said defensively , " Shellfishp118does not disagree with Katharine Congreve and I am in a position to know , having known her from the bassinet . " " I was n't impugning Miss Congreve , " said Mrs. Wainright-Lowe . " If I was impugning anyone . . . " But just then Miss Duff , who was about to be impugned , marched out the door , ordered her dogs to " Heel , damnit , " and charged off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mrs. Wainright-Lowe again . Now that the dogs were gone and now that practicallyeveryone in town had spoken to him , there was again nothing to do and no attitude to strike . Turning a little to the left , he said to his twin , " This is the most boresome summer A.D. " It was indeed a summer not in any way superior to those of his school friends whom he had formerly pitied since they were either shunted off to camp to learn the doubtful art of making fire with sticks or to grandparents , set in their ways and in the belief that a child 's sole commission in life was to be seen and not heard . He and the twins had had one awful , unforgettable summer , to be sure , when Cousin Katharine had gone out West and they had been sent to the Stygian Newportvilla of their Uncle Daniel Thornton , a queer fish who kept his own appendix pickled in a jar under a glass bell in the library . All that summer he had sought to improve his wards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fall of the Roman Empire and every morning after breakfast , no matter what the weather was , they had had to sit in the library , in full view ofp119that pale inner worm of his and write an essay  --  or rather a pensae , as he more stylishly put it  --  for Uncle Daniel was in love with the written word and called himself " a member of the scribblers ' fraternity , " though he had been published only once , with an epithalamium in dimeter , in The Harvard Advocate . The rest of the time in Newport had been divided between orderly excursionsto Bailey 's Beach with an acidulous Fraulein hired for the season ( their governess , Miss Bowman , who was from Santa Fe , had been refused house-room by Uncle Daniel who did not favor the West which he called " the ultramontane colonies where nothing flourishesexcept the solecism " ) and equally well-ordered afternoon picnics with suitable children as bored as they . The whole summer had had the languid , empty air of convalescence . But so had this present one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire a boat to sail among the islands of the wild Atlantic ; nor roasted corn on the rocks at Pemaquid ; always before , Cousin Katharine sitting sidesaddleand wearing a perky derby and a regal habit of dark blue poplin , had taken them for moonlight horsebackrides . They had not even played croquet or boccie . Conceivably the world was coming to an end.  |p120Billy  Bartholomew , the blasphemous and long-winded blacksmith , was sitting in the doorway of his shop directlyopposite the store , alternately reading a newspaper and observing the doings of his fellows with a misanthropiceye . Billy disliked almost everyone and he especiallydisliked Katharine Congreve who took her horses to Bingham Bay to be shod . Through innuendoes , through a maze of hints about " someone , naming no names , not a thousand miles away , " through a crabbed castigation of the rich and of summer people and " certainparties that get themselves up like Lady Astor 's plush horse , " the shaggy , baggy , cantankerous old man had , in the past , lambasted her to Andrew when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ callingon him and when he was reminded of her existence by the sight of her maids going into the drugstore or by the spectacle of Miss Congreve herself in her splendid carriage , her coachman dressed to the nines , Pegasus and Derek trotting along in their infuriating shoes . He had the caution never to make a direct attack but circuitously , speaking of " some people who are ruining the country by refusing to buy in the domestic market , " of " people who come down here in the summer and think they can lord it over us , " of " hoity-toity spinster women who think they know it all , " he arrived , eventually , at his oldp121wound which he loved and cherished and kept open , bleeding for all the town to see . Although Billy was garrulous and tiresome and usuallyangry , Andrew needing company made his way across to the cool , cavernous barn , piled to its rafters with wheels and broken springs , the skeletons of sleighs , old lanterns , splayed creels , rat-chewed landing nets . On top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy kept tuned to a Canadian station ; over it there came a watery wail from Toronto and , at certain times , the exultantvoice of a young woman who advertised " live honey " which could be ordered through arrangement with one 's local grocer ; in the background , the static sometimes gave the impression of bees producing on the spot . " Glad to have this unexpected honor , " he said as Andrewsat down on the floor beside him . For some time then he read aloud the obituaries of people he did not know and the fillers in the Bangor Courier . In a rich , ministerial voice , he intoned , " There are more rats than people in New Orleans , Louisiana . ' What do you think of that ? More rats than people . " Then , in two different voices , as if he were reading a dialogue , he presented a question and answer : " Question : Why is neatsfoot oil so called ? Answer : Neat is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaningox or oxen . Neatsfoot oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained from the feet of cattle . "  |p122He  fell silent and leafed through a magazine called The Northern Farmer . From time to time he looked up and sneered at someone in the street . " How Albert can call that thing a car is beyond me , " he said . And some time later he observed , " There 's Jasper walking like a fiddler crab , sign he means to take a fit today . " Billy 's pleasure , apart from mustering odd data , was to inveigh against the government and against women for both of whom he had an unremitting hatred . He led his lean ( he himself was stout and red and hairy ) embittered wife a wretched life , and their exchange of vituperation in public places was as much a part of the local scene as the springtime arrival of the alewives or the daily passage of Miss Congreve through the streets . Anything that was low or uncomfortable or dishonest or ugly was , in Billy 's mind , either womanly or governmentaland he liked to confound the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House and in Congress " and calling Mayor Curley " a damned flapper . " Of his horse , an irascible white geldingwith one blue eye , he said , " When he gets my dander up , I call him Carrie Nation , but generally I call him something sweeter . " His sweeter name was Dave . And all the murders he recounted  --  he did this well ; he had a histrionic flair and a sincere appreciation of bloodshed  --  had been committed by women whose victims , always men , had died through fiendish , housewifely tricks ; they had drunk arsenic with their morning coffee , had eaten ground glass in their rice pudding and died a dog 's death , had been decapitated with hatchets as they read the Sun/day papers . A relative of his who had gone West and rashly had married a native had been eaten to death by a pack of dogs belonging , significantly enough , to his mother-in-law . Billy 's nickname for Mrs. Bartholomew was Lizzie Borden . " The blue , or sulphur-bottomed whale is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ioo feet and a weight of 150 tons , " he read , picking up the newspaperagain . He exhaled a breath of beer though it was not yet noon ; he made the beer himself and drank it green and bottles of it , in the dark recesses of the smithy , sometimes exploded like a clap of thunder . " Here 's something else , " he said . " Dried skinks are still used medicinally in certain parts of the United States . ' Does n't say what parts or what for . That 's typical of these women on the papers ; they leave out half of what a man wants to know . Also I am fully of the opinion that a good part of the time these facts are not true . For example , do you believe as it says right here that the jaw is the strongest part of the body ' ? " Andrew , to please him , said he doubted it and Billy yawned and put The Courier aside . " It 's as plain as a pikestaff that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , " he said gloomily . " Now you take Charley Smithwick , when he was a little shaver he wanted to be a blacksmith and he spent more time with me than he did away from me learning my trade . He would have been a good man , but I never blamed him for throwing me over for Uncle Sam when it became the self-evident fact of the matter that the horse-drawn car/riage was a gone goose . Charley , I am happy to report , has begun to rally . It is my conviction that he is one of the two or three people I have ever known who was worth his salt . " " When is he going away do you think ? " asked Andrew . " He ought n't to go back too soon . He ought to lay around his mother 's house for a good long time . Else how can he get the strength to become  --  as it is my full opinion that he will  --  the kingpin of the whole U. S. navy shebang ? I am persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring his ship right up to headtide . " The fact that Charles had neither received nor been ambitious for promotion was ignored by everyone , and he was called " the captain , " " the skipper , " and " the admiral " and it was believed by many in the town that his finger was on the pulse of the world . " You ca n't tell me , " said Billy now , " that being right there on the spot in Tokyo and Shanghai and all that he does n't know all there is to be known about this socalledFar East . But he 's tight-lipped even with me , his tried and true old friend . He knows a lot he ca n't put out . " The eulogy went on and when he began , " I 'll take my share of credit in the molding of that young man . . . " Andrew surreptitiously leaned toward the radio and concentrated on the phrenetic pops and ululations from Canada . When he ended , " You mark my words , " Andrew sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come to thep125Bay , " he said , " and her Ladyship has got the pip . My , my , there 's a lot going on in the world . A lot more than meets the eye , and a lot of it that do n't bear too close examination , if you get my meaning . " " I do n't get your meaning , " said Andrew nervously . " I do n't get your meaning at all . " " Well , you know , like I said , there was a lot that Charley knows about those Chinamen and Japs that he 's not telling every Tom , Dick and Harry . Well , everybody'sgot something like that , have n't they ? Not so important but something to keep in the dark all the same . I bet if you were of a mind to do it , you could tell me a good deal I 'm mildly mildly , I repeat  --  curious to know . Why lights are burning in the middle of the night or whatever . " " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to , " said Andrew . " What about Charles Smithwick ? " demanded the blacksmith , clenching one enormous fist as if he were looking for a fight . " Be careful how you talk about Charles Smithwick . " " Oh , just about what 's going to happen to him one of these days , " said Andrew and ducked out the door and ran up the hill toward Congreve House . He had turned in at the gate before he realized that he had not mailed the letters . He debated whether to go back now or to wait until after lunch . Seeing Cousin Katharine feeding the swans and not looking in the least unwell , he decided to wait and to spend the time now trying to find out why shep126had behaved so eccentrically . He hailed her , and she greeted him warmly . If he had had any idea of broachinga serious subject to her , he had to put it aside . She would talk of nothing but the downy woodpecker fledglingsthat this morning had at last flown out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though that , detective-like , he noticed : there was a long slim glass of pernod on the iron tea table and when she had finished with Helen and Pollux , she began to drink it , not in sips but in big swallows . He had never seen her drink in the middle of the day before . He wondered if , all of a sudden , she was going to become fast and cut her hair and even dye it . He half wished she would . But there was not even a suggestion of a crack in her facade and when she saw him looking at her aperitif , she said , " I was longing for Paris today . Nothing brings it back to me more clearly than this delicious drink . " " No , " Andrew said to his importunate twin who had been asking too many stupid questions , " I will not take you there again because there is absolutely no point in eating alewives . You can go by yourself if you want to . " The twin business had begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in sight . At lunch , each time he had opened his mouth to say that everyone in town knew that Cousin Katharine had stayed up all night and that the Empress Katharine  --  called now , horror of horrors , La Paloma  --  was in the harbor seven miles away , someone had interrupted him . Finally he had moodily askedp127to be excused before dessert and ever since had been lying in the hammock drafting in his mind a series of black-hand letters to be sent to Charles Smithwick , Billy , and Honor who , at lunch , had called him a gasbagthough the fact was that he had not got a word in edgewise . He had not gone to the post office but had put the letters in his bureau drawer and had told himself that he would mail them when he got good and ready . He watched Brantley Wainright-Lowe pegging along the road in shorts and a tennis visor and he saw Miss Duff , dressed in a mechanic 's coverall and a baseball cap , riding past on her motor-bike to hunt for bargains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it , day after day ? " she hollered and was gone with a threateningpull at her police siren . She disliked boys and declaredthat they did nothing but crack their knuckles and ask each other riddles . " Pop ! Pop ! " she would say to him on meeting him in the road and give him a hard look . " When is a door not a door ? Really ! " He was too busy with other things today to resent her implication that he was a lazy and overgrown baby , though he filed it away to consider later , for he had found that slights and insults often served to distract him from his deeper grievance ; for one whole day he had been sustained by Honor 's charge that he handled his knife and fork like Mutt . He turned over in his tree-hung cradle , his back to the road , and gazed upward at the lightning rods and the broad arched doors of the barn ; the iron whale was veering east . As he watched , he saw Cousin Katharinep128come round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lilacs . She appeared and disappeared behind the sweep of columnsas she approached the door and then for a moment she stood framed by the two central ones , looking into the rosary opposite where she had perhaps heard a bird , so motionless and tall , placed so symmetrically that she looked to be a part of the house itself , like the cool , impassive statue of Minerva . Today she wore a full skirt of yellow linen , a tucked white blouse with wide sleeves that were inflated with the breeze , and a ribbon crossed at her neck and pinned with a cameo ; her white hair rose from her forehead in a high pompadour . She listenedfor a moment and then she turned and though she looked directly at him , she did not call or wave or smile , seemed not even to recognize or see him . He was nonplusedby this preoccupation  --  or was it displeasure ? He was accustomed to preoccupation in his parents and lately this had been their usual role , but not in her , never in her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who came within her orbit . For an awful moment , there flashed preposterously across his mind the thought that she really had read his wicked thoughts and knew he wanted Charles to die ( at night before he went to sleep , he could not help it , he kept seeing Charles 's bloody , decimated body strewn all over the highway and he was sometimes paralyzed with fear that he would talk in his sleep ) and she had stayed up all night long writing to his parents to tell them that they should lock him up somewhere before it was too late . He knew a boy , Teddy Throckmorton , who wasp129only one year older than he who had gone berserk , out of a clear sky , and had threatened a cook or a maid or someone with a straight razor and had been taken away to an insane asylum . At Sewell it was rumored that he was in a padded cell and that he ate out of a bowl on the floor like a dog . Possibly he was going crazy ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd betterread a book , he thought , or his mind might do somethingdreadful , and he picked up Life on the Mississippi . Over the top of it , though , he watched his cousin . She went in in a minute , closing the front door softly so that the knocker would not sound , but the image of her there persisted , poised perfectly in the exact center of the stage . Or like a judge at the middle of his long , legal pen , sentencing the prisoner to death . " I sent thee late a lilac wreath , Not so much honoring thee , As giving it a hope , that there It could not withered be , " sang Honor ; her voice was reedy and clean , as pellucidas a shallow , amber pool . She sang and stopped , unable , perhaps , to continue with her paraphrase or asked , perhaps , to put the lilacs into water . The house was silent . At the back of his mind , Andrew heard Poor Hollisring the bell for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoke-house . He continued to stare at the expressionless face of CongreveHouse and at the after-image of Cousin Katharine . Didp130she know ? Did she know that as he lay here hour after hour under his great-grandfather 's elm trees he wished and prayed for the death of someone who had never done him any harm ? Together with the fear and the guilt and the dismay at his atrocious inner nature , there was a kind of obscene pleasure in it and he thought how he might most dramatically blackmail himself by writing an anonymous letter to her , telling on himself . " Madam , you harbor a serpent of the male sex , " he would write and sign it with a skull and crossbones . The more he thought about it , the more convinced he became that all last night she had been writing to his father about him . The letter had been very thick . He was not sure that he would ever mail it . He turned from Charles to Cousin Katharine and back again , living through the afternoon . Alternately he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An hour passed . He saw Beth , pregnant , wearing her kittens like saddlebags , adroitly mount the Dutchman's-pipe to her mistress 's windows and just after the bell at St. James 's rang for four , its last note loitering and dissipating then in a spray of fading echoes , the owner of this belvedere appeared , assisted the cat and called down to Andrew , " Will you take me out to get a water lily for my spittoon ? " and vanished , letting the vine fall back into place like a curtain . She must want to get him alone to give him the third degree . His heart was as loud and jazzy as a dance band , but he got up and called back as naturally as he could , " Sure ! Now ? " and she reappeared in a blue silk wrap/per . " I 'm changing for a swim . I 'll meet you there . Just you and I , no little girls allowed . " The twins , hearing this interchange , came to the downstairswindows and Harriet cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily caroled , " As if we 'd get our hair all wet when Raoul is coming ! " " Beth will go with us , " said Cousin Katharine , comingagain to the window . She had always taught her cats to swim . When he came to think of it , Cousin Katharine was awfully peculiar ; he had always before taken her for granted but suddenly he no longer did . Why , for example , was she so attached to such oldfashionedpastimes ? The game of patience while she drank her tea if she had no visitors ; the simple needlepoint ; the making of potpourri with sun-dried rose petals ; the outmoded customs of reading poetry aloud , and mounting butterflies on pins . She even smelled oldfashioned , of some fastidious , countrified scent ( Maddox made it for her from an arcane receipt ) no more conspicuousand no more nameable than the general sweetnessof a rural garden just come into bloom . She moved in a nebula of this and of dove-gray chiffon or lilac lawn , regarding the works of Robert Browning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds which she described in a black ledger with a thin gold pencil , rejoicing in them all except for the puffin which she found absurd and the cowbird which she deploredon moral grounds . The cat was always doomed from kittenhood to wear a bell of piercing tone.  |p132If  insanity ran in the family , who was she to have him put away ? For a moment , he was inexplicably exhilarated and he set off at a run , taking the longest way through the meadow , a field of timothy full of daisies and nests of voles and stands of wild iris . A bright snake flicked past him and he ran after it and though he could not catch it , he shrieked in the direction of the kitchen , " There 's a snake here , Mrs. Shea ! " Instantly , like a jack-in-thebox , the woman rose from the steps and vanished into the house , slamming the screen door behind her to finish her Hail Marys trembling as she stood upon a chair . Maddox , who was clipping the box beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his look of sullen disapproval . " If you throw any more rocks at my Seckel pears , I 'll snake you , " he said sourly . Honor came to the dining room window to scold , " You 're mean ! You 're a beastly boy and you 'll never go to heaven . You tell Mrs. Shea there was n't a snake . " But he cried back , " I was only telling the truth . There was a snake . There are millions and trillions of snakes in the grass . " He stood still , his eyelids burning in the sun , and chanted , " Grass snake , water snake , bull snake , viper , red snake , green snake , cobra , adder . " But the joke , like all jokes these days , palled and he sighed and his smile faded . No prank seemed worth the effort when there was neither confederate nor claque . Morose again , he plodded on . When he had changed into his swimming suit in the damp bath-house ( he hated it here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran on stilts up and down the slippery walls ) he sat in the tippy rowboat waiting for Cousin Katharine , carelessly startling two young turtles that were sunning on the rock at the lake 's edge ; their place was taken by an enormous butterfly that shuttered its pansy-yellow wings three times before it flew away . He plucked the beggar 's lice off his socks and swaying the boat lightly as if he were still in the hammock , he crooned , " Charles Smithwick , die , oh , Charles , get well , oh , big fat nitwit , Charley Smithy , go to hell for leather . " A stream of images like a motion picture passed before his eyes : Charles was swimming off the dangerous rocks at Pemaquid and a squall was coming up ; under the darkening sky , the phosphorescent spindrift shone ; it was a sinister sight . Charles was too far out ! He could not get back ! For the third time he went down ! Months later , flaccid and fishbelly white , the body was washed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ringing the bell in the firehouse to summon the volunteer brigade and the cry went up through the streets of Hawthorne , " It 's the Smithwick house ! It 's going up in flames ! " Beulah was in the sewing room at Congreve House , sewing a fine seam , and Victor was at the store , but Charles was in his bed in the burning house and he died before the marshal came . Charles Smithwick ate a poisonous mushroom . His lifelong enemy stabbed him through the heart . His mother , mistakingthe bottles , gave him iodine instead of Castoria and he writhed to death before the doctor had evenp134finished cranking up his car . As they were leaving the graveyard , Victor said to Andrew , " Let 's go smoke . " He was frightened again and when Cousin Katharine came down the path , he bent his head , pretending to be tying his sneakers . She was wearing a long red linen cape over her bathing suit and a straw picture hat that tied under her chin , making her look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came trotting after her , mewing conversationally , her high tail waving like a plume . She leaped neatly into the boat to sit squarely in the middle , winking her shrewd eyes . For a long while Cousin Katharine said nothing significant . Under the white sun of summer as he slowly rowed her from this archipelago of lily pads to that , he listened to her casual stream of talk , but at the same time he followed the paths of the blue devils ' darning needles that skated through the reeds and watched the holiday fishermen try for bass ; once someone in a red motorboat got a strike and Andrew rested his oars to watch the catch . The struggling fish arched angrily as it twisted through the air and when it was landed , Cousin Katharine clapped her hands and cried , " What a sight ! Oh , what a day ! " But on a day like this , he and Victor should be fightingwith the valiant bass ( his new flies , ordered for his birthday from Abercrombie and Fitch , had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked across the water in the direction of the Smithwick house , but all he could see of it above the trees was its single solid chimney from which arose ap135line of smoke as narrow as a pin . And then , a minute later , from far off , he heard Victor 's lighthearted approachand Cousin Katharine said , " It 's a pity your friend has n't a quieter talent . Could n't we teach him to juggle ? It would be just as droll as yodeling and it would disturb the peace far less . " Hating Victor , Andrew cut the water deeply , woundingit , and said , " He 'd juggle if Charles told him to , " and under his breath he went on , " He 'd suck eggs if Charles said suck eggs . " " Yes , he is devoted to his big brother , is n't he ? " said Cousin Katharine . " I do n't think he 's been to our house once this summer . " " He 'll never come to our house again . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a ridiculous , unworthy notion . Someone has to look after Charles . " " They could hire a nurse . " " And what would they pay her with ? You should n't say such selfish things , dear , they make a bad impression . And you should remember that Charles ca n't stay forever . " " Charles can stay forever , " said Andrew grimly , gougingthe water . " And he will . " They were near the end of the lake where the water petered out in a marsh beside the road and when he glanced up , Andrew saw Victor just rising over the top of the hill on his way home ; from his wide-open mouth the yodeling poured copiously like something from a pitcher . Cousin Katharine waved and called , " Hello ! Ip136hope your brother 's well today , " and softly to Andrew she said , " Do you suppose it 's related to gargling ? I must try it some time . " " Hello ! " cried Victor exuberantly . " Charles is okay . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give him our fond regards . " Enraged , Andrew set his jaw . " You got the cat with you ? " bellowed Victor and when Cousin Katharine assured him that Beth was there and if he looked closely he could see her flattened out now in the middle seat , taking the sun , he slapped his behind with the magazine he was carrying and shouted , " Oh , boy ! I hope she do n't get seasick . " " If she does , we 'll give her Mothersills in her cream . " Tee hee ! Ha ha ! Shut up , said Andrew to himself , shut up and that goes for your damned old brother too . Not very long ago , he had heard about a man who had got a cactus spine in his finger that worked itself into his blood stream and finally got to his heart and killed him like a poisoned arrow . It would n't be hard at all to send some cactus spines in a black-hand letter . " Wo n't you come for a row with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and flippantly replied , " No , thank you kindly , ma'am . I got to get this Albert Payson Terhune installment to my brother p.d.q . " And beginning to yodel again , he marched on quickly , swinginghis arms as if he were doing calisthenics . Andrew turned the boat and doggedly rowed on . " The Smithwicks are a touching family , " said Cousin Katharine . " I hope the chap recovers . If anything shouldp137happen , if Charles should die , I think poor Beulah would die herself . She very nearly did when her husband was lost at sea . " She was speaking of the terrible shipwreck , before Victor was born , that had cost the towns of Hawthorne and Bingham Bay eighteen lives . He did not look at her for fear she was looking at him . " Perhaps we should take him strengthening things , calves ' foot jelly and beef tea and all those other things in books . Do you think a bottle of my father 's best burgundywould restore him ? We must go and call on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian not to cheer the sick . " Andrew , feeling very sick himself , smiled politely . " I hope Charles gets well soon , " he said . For a short space of silence , he kept his eyes averted from his cousin 's regard which , nevertheless , he could feel upon him like the silent , examining scrutiny of Dr. Townsend to whom , last winter , he had lied about the pain he had ; and exactly as the doctor had finally touched the flaming spot in his right side and said , " Here , boy , you do your part and I 'll do mine and between us we 'll rout this bellyache , " so Cousin Katharine said to him at last , with utmost gravity and sympathy , " Would n't it help to tell me what it is that 's troubling you so terribly this summer ? You can trust me . " Involuntarily , he relaxed as he had done when the doctor had seemed to enter with him into his pain and keep him company and even to feel himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He remembered how then he had willingly answered all thep138questions . But a real thorn in the side was one thing and a figurative one another and his moment of ease was followed by deep distrust of her intrusion on his privacy . Grasping out of the air a plausible reason for his brooding , he told her that last year he had especially hated school . " But surely I remember that your mother told me you liked it much better than before , " she said earnestly . " Did n't contract bridge take the lower school by storm ? And did n't Maeve tell me  --  I know she did  --  that you played every afternoon at Johnny and Allen Webster 's house ? " He shook his head . It was true that half the boys at Sewell could think of nothing else but bridge last year and he had gone , twice , to the Websters ' house but he could never fix his mind on the game , never was sure what was meant by " trumps " , and after some gaffe that caused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not the slightest idea what he had done , he was expelled from the foursome . If his mother had said that to Cousin Katharine and had believed it , it showed how little she knew of the way he . spent his time . When he did not go to the Public Library to read the New EnglishDictionary , he prowled through Scollay Square , counting the sailors as his cousin counted birds , and in the doorways of abandoned buildings , smoking cubebs stolen from his mother 's cook , waiting for the summer . At first he said that it was Latin that had made him miserable ( this was an outright lie for Latin was the only thing he had ever liked in school ) and then he said ,  |p139in  quick succession , that it had been Chapel , History and Algebra . It had been Miss Bowman 's interminable quotationsfrom Poor Richard and The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table ( the Lord knew Bowman was enough to set one 's teeth on edge . He and the twins had long outgrown the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roles of housekeeper and secretary to Maeve although she did not relax her vigilance over the children ; energetic and stoutly self-improving , she read hard books on economics and psychology and as she did so gnashed her teeth as if she lay on Procrustes ' bed ) and her insistence that he recite the Gettysburg Address immediately after brushing his teeth , night and morning , as an exercise in memory . In a way everything he said  --  except his attack on Latin  --  was true and it all made far more sense than if he had said he was ready to commit suicide or murder just because some dumb country hick had never stopped to see his brand-new fishing tackle nor even whistled as he passed by . Victor had left no notes beside the lantern on the gate , he had not one single solitary time called Andrew on the telephone : he might at least have done that and still kept his eye on the invalid ; they had sometimestalked for half an hour until other people on the party line impatiently snapped at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to hear about this . What if you 're trying to get a doctor for an emergency and ca n't get through because boys are saying riddle me this , riddle me that until the cows come home ? " They had retaliated by putting a ticktack on her living-roomp140window when she was there alone on maid 's night out and scaring her half to death . " But there 's no Algebra to stump you now , " said Cousin Katharine , " and poor old Bowman is far away . Is n't it more that other thing you sometimes came to me about ? That feeling at home you could n't put your finger on ? " Of course ! How could he have forgotten ? But strangely enough , as he began to speak of it , she interruptedhim to praise the way he was so capably managingthe boat with its dangerous keel and to direct him toward a far patch of floating flowers . And as if they had been engaged in nothing but small talk , she began to plan a picnic on Stork Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she inquired whether they should have whole lobsters or put the meat into sandwiches ; should they color the hard-boiled eggs with beet juice in the old-fashioned way ? And should they roast corn or should the meal be cold ? Perhaps it would be a greater treat for the Smithwicks to go to Pemaquid ; but she did not like the waters there , for there was no hope at all for a swimmer if anything went wrong . ( His mouth was dry . ) She wandered and lightly talked about the picnics of the past , beginning in a fairy-story way with , " Once upon a time , the world was a picnic and Maeve and I were allowed to drink champagne when we went to the Bois at holidays , taking innumerable hampers and silver spoons and tablecloths and chinaware . So cumbersome and so very elegant ! The inconveniences , as they arep141called these days , did n't disturb us in the least . We were as gay as larks in spite of the fact that we had no paper plates and ate off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recipient of her bright-eyed reminiscences and speculations , her prophecies and her stray , unprefaced facts that she interpolatedwithout rhyme or reason ; as they skirted round the smallest and the nearest of the islands , she asked him if he was aware that on a certain island in the British Virgins , the natives formally disputed whether God could laugh . Fastidiously and with close attention to its good points and its flaws , she rejected lily after lily like a woman shopping for a hat , and as they zigzagged back and forth , she talked continually , her even , undemandingvoice lulling , taking him willy-nilly away from the sharpness of his discontent and his suspiciousness and even leading him part of the way into her remembered adult world . She told him about a cruise she had taken once with his parents to the Caribbean and she described to him the extraordinary fish they had seen and the sea birds and the strange plants with stranger names , the shake-shake tree and the fiddlewood and the monkeycan't-climb . " I meant to tell you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay last night . " " Oh , that makes me very sad . Do n't tell your father when you write him . She meant so much to him . " " I know she did , " he said and to prove to Cousin Katharine that he did know , he told her about one afternoonlast winter when , after the tea tray had gone , hep142had established himself in a corner of the library to read his father 's second-class mail . Though he was really absorbed in it , thinking how extremely useful a home elevator would be for someone like Miss Heminway in her wheel-chair , he could not help hearing a passage between his parents who did not seem to know that he was there . His father was standing before the case of yachting trophies looking down at his mother who was sitting on the fire bench with her head between her hands . His father said , " For God 's sake , Maeve , this testifies that I have done something with my life , " and he gestured toward the loving cups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught the words , " Oh , yes , you were an emperor in your fashion . " Cousin Katharine frowned . " Has no one ever told you that eavesdropping is a vicious habit ? " " They were n't telling secrets . That 's all they said . After that they had a drink and talked about whether they should go to Europe on a big boat or a little one . " Actually , his father had said something else but he did not repeat it to Cousin Katharine because it had been so rude and it had been about her . He had said , " You 've grown so like Katharine that half the time I do n't know whether I 'm talking to you or her . You are mad to imitatea manner that you perfectly know sticks in my gizzard . The infuriating reasonableness of it ! " Cousin Katharine smiled . " No , I suppose you are n't repeating anything you should n't , so let 's forget it . Poor John ! That yacht was a beauty . " Now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lake and asp143Andrew turned the boat toward it , stirring up a school of pickerel , she trailed her fingers in the water and began to talk again . " There is no water in the world as clear and clean as this . This is what Madeleine St. Denis envies us the most and I do n't wonder because it seemed to me , when I visited there , I saw nothing but stagnant water . Louisiana was like something drawn by Dore , every inch of it covered with tendrils and naked roots and vines and that hairy moss hanging from the oak trees . " From their new position , Andrew could see clearly into the Smithwicks ' yard and there , indeed , was a lengthy figure stretched out in a canvas deck-chair , the face obscured by a straw hat with a ruptured crown . Victor was standing on his head in the garden path . He looked as if he had been in that position for hours . His cousin 's self-supporting monologue went on . " . . . Like the stagnant water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from Paris for Sunday lunch . I have never eaten such melon since . It tasted of the sun . . . Victor turned a back somersault. and through the straw hat that capped the inert rope of flesh there came a booming voice , " Good enough , you landlubber you , " and Victor patted his open mouth , favoring this time a war whoop instead of a yodel . With half himself Andrew watched the brotherly horseplay and the other half was drawn into the embrace of Cousin Katharine 's voice . " After the meal , in all ways perfect for a perfect summerday , our host and the other men practiced tight-ropep144walking in the park while the ladies of the party sat in a tree-house admiring one another 's jewels . One of them had a golden cowrie shell in which she kept her heroin . " " Honestly ? " he gasped and when she nodded he felt a quiver of delight run straight through him . " While all this was going on , John took Maeve and me for a row around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgusting smells that came to us and how the oars dredged up the mud and brought to light the odious things that grow in stagnant water , a horrid , reptilian green . In some places we had to lie down flat in the boat when we went under trees that bent from bank to bank . Once John lost his balance and through some stupid accident , splattered your mother with his oar and totally ruined her velvet dress . It was no loss , really ; we had agreed that it was a shade of violet that never suited her . But she was terribly nervy all that summer and when this happened , she burst into tears . She cried all the way back to Paris . " Now they had come to the lily of her choice and as she tugged at its snaky stem , the fascinated cat sat up to watch , thrust out a paw as if to help and then was quiet , her tail curled around her feet . There was to Andrew a new and exquisite quality in the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin 's sweet past life , or the foretaste of enjoyment , the source of which was undefined . In the end , the world might change and the cornucopiabe filled again . The name " Paris " took his fancy , acquiring for him a dimension it had never had before and the words " park " and " moat " and the image ofp145Frenchmen walking tight-ropes and of women sitting in a tree captivated him . He leaned forward in the boat and said , " What happened afterward ? Did you show your jewels too ? Did Mother cry in front of all the others ? " " Maeve went into the house to set herself to rights , " said Cousin Katharine , dreamily , intent upon the elusive stem of the water lily , " and the rest of us had a cassis under a false sycamore that was bound round and round by a thick vine that corkscrewed up the trunk like the serpent going up Eve 's apple tree . The cassis was made on the premises . It is odd the way one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the scene of disaster . Why should I remember that Peter 's cassis was made by his servants out of his own currants ? There , I 've got it ! " Her eyes shone and she cradled the lily in her hands , showing it to the cat . " A prize , is n't it , Beth ? " " What was the disaster ? Did the tree-house fall down ? " " I should n't have said disaster , ' " she said , " because the ruin of a dress has n't quite got that stature , particularly for the bride of a very rich young man . " " Oh , was that all ? " He was disappointed . " Yes , but actually there was more to it than that , for she found out the next day that she was going to have a baby  --  or babies , as it turned out  --  and that was what had put her so on edge . I shall always remember the taste of cassis when I think of the day that the Shipley children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cassis , for our host had given us a bottle of it to bring back . " His interest flagged and he turned again to the boys in their desultory garden . They were so near the bank now that when Charles took off his hat , Andrew could see him clearly . He was quite as unusual-looking as Victorbut in a different way ; he had a flattened nose and his eyebrows were black although his hair was the color of sand . His forehead was a gleaming bulb from which that strange stiff hair rose straight up like a tall lawn . He did not much resemble his pictures because his illnesshad whittled him down to the bone . Beulah said his legs were rubber and his blood was water and he had n't the strength of a newborn babe . If he stayed out too late in the dewy evening , he might catch a chill and die of double pneumonia . Charles began to read his magazine ; the parrot wanderedout the door and stood , laughing privately , beside the canvas chair ; Victor turned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Who told you the Empress Katharine was in ? " his cousin asked suddenly . " I ca n't remember , " Andrew said . " Everybody knows everything in this town . Maybe it was Mr. Barker and maybe it was Bluebell James . They all knew your light was on all night . " Cousin Katharine shivered . " Go back , " she said . " I 'm nervous about this boat . " He knew enough not to ask her a direct question and docilely he attended to his own business , turning thep147boat once more and cutting off the pantomime of the Smithwicks ' contentment . He felt again the clutching void of summer with nothing to look forward to except more of these long , long days fading gradually into the gloomy winter . He wondered , without caring a pin , whether his parents , in Dublin now , were any gayer than they had been when he had seen them last , sitting far apart in the back of the car , as it took them to the station for New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were going to a funeral . " They make me furious , " she said . " We ca n't not answer when we 're spoken to so why can they ? " and Harriet said , " I 'm glad they 're gone . " As soon as the car was out of sight , the house had seemed to shake itself from a deep sleep ; from the maids ' sitting room had faintly come the sound of a victrolaplaying " On the Sunny Side of the Street " and Hal , the choreman , covering the furniture with muslin shrouds , began to sing " Santa Lucia . " The children waited in the ghostly drawing room for Alfred to bring the car back from the South Station and take them to the North and all at once all three of them , for no other reason than that it was summertime , began to laugh . He thought of the silent house , shut up against the sun , holding the hush in its halls and niches and he wondered how he could ever be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least as old as Cousin Katharine . Much farther away than Ireland , more indistinct than dreams , his bemused parents seemed irrevocably gone . He said , " Supposing our house burned down or suppos/ing they decided never to come back again , would Honor and Harriet and I live with you ? " " Andrew ! " She was shocked . " The house ca n't burn down , they will come back . You must be careful what you think or it may happen ! You must be careful what you wish for when you are young for you may not want it when you are old . What if we heard when we got home that your house had burned down ? Would n't you feel as dreadful as if you 'd set it on fire yourself ? " He did not reply . Now they had reached the little pier and Cousin Katharine , gently laying the flower in a mossy cave at the base of a tree , waded into the water for her swim . Knee deep , she turned again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 'll tell you what I was doing all last night . I was planning the most wonderful party we have ever had . We shall have dancing and champagne , but the chief thing will be fireworks . Not the noise-for-noise-sake ones , for those I hate . But fountains and wheels and roman candles . Skyrockets and beautiful blood-red Catherine wheels . " As if she were descending to a bed , she entered the water ; in her mild wake came Beth . " What is a Catherine wheel ? " asked Andrew . " A spinning rack , " she called . " A stupendous round of sparks . Some of them look like rose windows . They 're gone before you know it . " " Was that really what you were doing , Cousin Katharine ? " But he did not believe her when she said it really hadp149been . For a while they swam in silence and then , still silent , they climbed up the path to Minerva 's temple where Mrs. Shea had left glasses and a bottle of cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encircled the gigantic , helmeted goddess , sipping the herbal brown drink with the summer day lying all about them ; there came , to their heedless ears , through the topaz atmosphere , the sound of the rowboat dipping in the meek south wind . The careful cat dried herself and washed her violet-veined ears . This afternoon had been a series of multitudinous beginningsthat had come to nothing ; now the sun had illuminated everything , now all was dimmed as a shadow intercepted the halo of June . Was this talk of Catherine wheels and lobster sandwiches nothing but a blind under the cover of which she was seeking his central , pertinacioussin ? She had said you must be careful what you think about or it may happen , you must be careful what you wish for . Drawn to his obsession , he could think of nothing else and in this quiet and in this nearness to her , omniscient , judging , he could not help it ; he said , " Do you think you can make somebody die by wishing for it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I mean like using those dolls the way they did in The Return of the Native ? " " You must not say these things . You must not think these thoughts ! Believe me , no one in the world is so detestable that you should wish him dead . " " I was thinking about a snake I saw in the meadow , " he said.  | " I know you were ! I know it ! " Her voice was flooded with relief and to his terrible embarrassment , he saw tears standing in her eyes . Perhaps it was true that she was sick and hurting somewhere . But while for her sake he wanted to be purged of his vileness , his interiorvoice went on and on relentlessly , " Charles Smithwick , die , die , die . " They went single file back to the house , Andrew in the lead . Cousin Katharine came fragrantly behind him , her cat on her shoulder , her water lily like an offering in her hand . She was so tall behind him ! Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of his head and reading everything that was written there . When they reached the front door , the cat leaped , purling , from her shoulder and Cousin Katharine leaned against the lintel for a moment , bendingher head forward as if to kiss his cheek . She did not , but the mass of her hair swept over his eyelids softer than snow . " Oh , Cousin Kate , shame , shame ! " came Honor 's taunting voice . " You 're showing preference ! " She stood at the foot of the stairs holding a pair of ballet slippers by their ribbons . " If Bowman ever hears that you baby the boy , she 'll send you straight to Coventry . " " Be quiet ! " Cousin Katharine put her fingers to her lips and bade the children listen ; in the pear tree at the entrance of the picking garden , a thrush was singing ; when the intricate and formal song was finished , Cousin Katharine clapped her hands . " Bravo ! " she cried . The children were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Encore ! " until they were hoarse . Andrew snatched one of the ballet slippers from Honor 's hand and running halfway down the lawn he whirled it like a boomerang and let it fly off to land in the dead center of the hammock . They raced for it through the sunlight , but even the whistling in his ears did not drown out the voice and even as he put the length of the long lawn between them , he knew that Cousin Katharine knew everything . Her eyes were inescapable . He was inundatedby a wave of scalding anger and reaching the hammock first , he grabbed the ballet slipper and threw it into Honor 's face . She was so surprised that she only looked at him . " I think you 're going crazy , " she said . There was hardly any outrage in her voice . She seemed to be stating a fact . He did not trust himself with her and turning , without apologizing or refuting her declaration , he ran like the wind down to the orchard and when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and screamed.  |p152A  LETTER from John Shipley was waiting for Katharine when she and Andrew came back from the lake . In its thin , square European envelope , it lay on the table in the entrance hall , and though she changed the water in the cuspidor and took her time , painstakingly posing the lily so that it lay oblique to the burnished valentine of its pad , and though in this procedure , her hands were steady , she was invisibly assaulted . Her hands , moving with such deliberation that this might have been the creation of a masterpiece upon whose laurels she was to rest for the remainder of her life , in her imagination mauled the letter , and more vividly than she saw the chaste flower , she saw St. Stephen 's Green and him upon a bench , writing to her , using a book as a desk , the opal mist of Ireland and the sweetness of being in love hang/ing between his faculties and the red-haired children playing among the beds of public flowers . Importunate at her elbow , Harriet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's letter ? Please open it and see if he promises to bring us the plaid raincoats . " Katharine shook her head , said she was busy as Harrietcould plainly see and the girl , respectful but still impatient , fingered the foreign postage stamp and asked , " Then may I open it and read it to you ? " With the unkindprerogative of the person in charge , Katharine severely changed the subject and more sharply than she meant to , she said , " Go up at once to dress . Honor is ready , why are n't you ? " Wounded , Harriet ran upstairs without a word , but at the top she leaned over the banister and said , " I 'm sorry I was nosy , Cousin Kate . " There were several further domestic interruptions beforeshe could go to her room . Maureen had come in an excessive flood of tears to confess that she had broken a sugar bowl , not valuable , not pretty , and Katharine , aware that the girl for some time had been " carrying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this undue display over nothing at all meant , perhaps , that she was pregnant and that in the midst of upheaval and revolution , a husband would have to be found for her . But for the time being , she refused to think about it and comforted the girl by saying that she would deduct a dollar from her week 's wage . Mrs. Shea , wringing her hands and almost weeping , had reported that " the boy " had frightened her with a talep154of a snake in the meadow and she could not , would not , therefore , cook fish for dinner , the bellies of mackerelbeing what they were , Miss Congreve knowing how she felt . She revised the menu , endeavouring to keep a rasp of exasperation from her voice . Then Maddoxhad appeared at the windows of the dining room to announce , sepulchrally , that his prize Dr. Van Fleet rose bush , a new and costly importation from Long Island , had been mortally felled by the blacksmith 's dog whom he begged leave to shoot . Aggrieved by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children who had come to gape at the peacocks had litteredthe lawn with empty Walnetto boxes and gum wrappers . And Harriet 's feelings were hurt and Andrew . . . Once more greeting her father 's eyes , when at last her household let her go , she recalled his solacing precept , " When you are unsettled , consider yourself sub specie aeternitatis . " But the strength she gained from his advice failed to serve her when she read the letter from Dublin in which John 's consideration of the two of them under the aspect of eternity lacked , she could not help but feel , responsibility and compassion , was rash , was honest ( bull-headedly ) and unethical . The only anachronism in you he wrote that I find fault with is your caution . You once called it your " indeciduous Puritanism " ( how like you to use a botanical term ) but I beg you to name for me any people more incautious than the passionate men of Salem . While I deplore their violence , Ip155honor their conscience and conviction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must commit , I love what makes it necessary . In obedience to you , I have taken this trip , prolonging my agony and Maeve 's , and nothing has changed . My decision is incontrovertible and this dissembling is torment . There are times when I am close to anger with you . Yesterday we motored down to Tara and because the day was clear ( the only one we 've had so far ; the rain has not improved my state of mind ) we could see the whole of Ireland from the summit  --  or tell ourselves we could  --  like the assembled kings and poets and when Maeve innocently said , " If only Katharine were here ! This is the sort of panorama that she loves , " I leaped down her throat . I snapped , " Is it some special virtue in Katharine ? Would n't anybody in his right mind love this view ? " She cried when she defended you . I tell you this to show you how wretched I am , so cantankerousin this deceit that I am driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Will you not summon me back ? But in a sober postscript he wrote : Do not imagine that I do not have doubts . There are days when I am suicidal , thinking of the childrenfor whom I 've done nothing , to whom I shall now do much worse than nothing . And I say to myself , " This is their last happy summer . " I hope they are the happiest they have ever been . Stripped of the integument of middle age , John Shipley stood before her , twenty years old , and for onep156callow , callous moment , she leaned on him , abiding by his decision , a yielding woman trusting a man 's strength . But then , miserably , she thought of Andrew and of the lures she had thrown to him . He had seemed to rise to every one of them , though she could not be sure . She could be sure of nothing , only that he bitterly hated someone but whether it was his father or herself , she did not know . Within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So then for a child , must one repudiate one 's victory and love and life and go on existing in a state of need ? John Shipley , in his anarchy , would say no , and the world would say yes , but in the end it was not John 's place to answer the question , it was only hers . And she could not answer it now for she must change for tea and put upon herself an air of insouciance with which to confront her friends who had said that she was ill . She was ill but not as they imagined . In the boat with Andrew she had heard herself saying things she never meant to say ( no one should ever know except herself the envy that had grated on her when she had learned that Maeve was pregnant ) ; she could not bear to think that any fiber of her will could relax and she was afraid it had already begun to happen and that the ganglion of her being was beginning , slowly , to atrophy . It would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came  --  Mr. Barker in his debonairMercedes  --  she wrote a note to Boston to order the fireworks for her ball , a mixed assortment , she instructed , with a preponderance of Catherine wheels . Asp157she looked through her address file for the name of the novelty shop she knew would send them to her , she came across the name of the stonecutter who had made Minerva and later had designed her father 's tombstone . Under his fig tree in his own backyard and under the aspect of eternity : what peace awaits us all ! Old Mr. Barker , who wore a monocle , handed up his cup to be refilled and to the St. Denis family he said , " You fellows need n't tell me that in Dixie you 've got any gardens that will put these in the shade . Even in a drought  --  and we had one last year to make you think of the Gobi  --  the gardens of Congreve House are a veritable paradise . " " Hear ! Hear ! " cried Edmund . " Is n't it wicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she shook her dimpled fist at the roses climbing up the stable wall . " Wicked is the word , " echoed the old man , still addressingthe Southerners who , as if they had been relegatedthere by reason of their being newcomers , sat a little apart from the regular Tuesday callers on the rim of the pond . " You take my word for it , this seeminglygood Christian woman says incantations when the moon is full and does her plantin ' when the Widow Smithwick 's crystal ball gives her the go-ahead sign . "  |p158Edmund  guffawed and nudged his son who rebuffed the gambit and became absorbed in lighting a Turkish cigarette . The decadent aroma drifted on two thin blue membranes of smoke , a European smell , a smell of snug cafes , bringing to Katharine a burst of fragmentary memories of morning conversations in Rome and Venice and Madrid in the middle of sight-seeing ( how rapaciousfor churches and galleries and historic houses she and Maeve had been ! ) and bringing , as well , a bittersweetnostalgia for those cities and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every yonder elevation , before the intimations of one 's immortality had ceased . Those ascending days of loving girlhood , long , long before Maeve 's ball which , a few minutes before , she had told her company , to their exclamatory delight , she meant to duplicate in August . She was committed , having allowed the twins to run back to the house to write down the event , permanently in ink , on the PhillipsBrooks calendar that listed , otherwise , only the probable date of Beth 's accouchement in July . On either side of her , Maeve 's copies in their lavenderdresses watched Raoul , lips parted , innocently preying . She wondered which of them would engage him in an adolescent holiday flirtation  --  Honor , audacious and piquant , or Harriet , serene and soft . Their resemblance to their mother today was so remarkable that even old Miss Heminway who could barely see had spoken of it , saying , " You ca n't miss your alter ego when you 've got her double strength , right here . " Katharine tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had succeeded , but Mr. Barker , following in Edmund 's raffish lead , winked at him through his owlish eyeglass and Raoul deliberately looked away and up at the weathervane on the barn . She was touched as she had been earlier when she thought of Raoul by the youthful intermixture of his nonchalance and his uncertainty , this arrogance with which he refused to join his elders in their buffoonery that was united to the humility with which he examined his surroundings , praising the house and the swans with his large , heavily lidded eyes and remaining silent exceptwhen he was asked a question . Rebellion , intellectualor filial , had caused him to obliterate his Southern accent but a soft , slow trace of it remained . His father 's diphthongs , on the other hand , and his inflections were as pronounced as Mr. Barker 's Mississippi valet 's , to such an extent , indeed , that after they had met him for the first time the twins , imitating him between convulsionsof glee , had said , " You did n't think you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the days when she had thought of marrying him , he had no accent either and she remembered a time when , angry with his father for something else , he had burst out , " Will you , for God 's sake , sound your final consonants ? " The whole family had rocked with laughter and an aunt had cried , " Does he mean something like Gabriel tootin ' on his final horn ? " Miss Duff , Hawthorne 's unofficial and undisputed dragoman , was presenting to the St. Denises a lengthy dossier on the Widow Smithwick , on whose advice Kath/arine presumably did her gardening , and on the Smithwickboys . She dwelt at length upon a theory that she herself had arrived at , that Charles had sprue . ( " Rampantin the Orient , I 'm told , sprue . Funny name . " ) Katharine , having ascertained that her other guests were occupied  --  Miss Heminway with talking in an undertoneto Harriet who had now to leave off casting sheep 's eyes at Raoul , Mrs. Tyler deep in conversation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Barker affirmed or emended Miss Duff 's statements  --  busied herself in a needless shifting of pots and caddies on the tea table and retired into the state of mind in which she had stumbled and floundered since the evening before , finding in it , on reflection and now that the crisis was past ( one crisis anyhow ) , a certain excitement and even an attractivenesslike something romantically forbidden , like certain kinds of pain which one should not enjoy but didopium-eatingperhaps , that imperiled the spirit but quelled the pain . Though it had disturbed her deeply , John 's letter was , in the end , no more than a letter and sub specie aeternitatis it was even less than that , only a sheet of paper hastily inscribed . Protected by that thought and by her guests and by her duties to them , the last flickerings of her agitation had gone . There lingered only a vague dread of the possible return of her dislocation which resembled , she now decided , her conception of death . She was sure that no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she took a healthy and mischievous pleasure and even bentp161her head to smile as she thought , " If only Mr. Barker could see my nightmare ! " Such must be the needs and the dangers of addicts of alcohol and thievery and settingfires , cleverly hiding their macabre manias to relish them alone . She glanced from guest to guest and thought , " Not one of them guesses that I have had glimpses of a morbid world hidden beneath my reasonand my senses . " 1But a gust of wind rippled over her white skirt and chilled her although it came from the south and was warmed with the sun : her eyes had fallen for the first time on Andrew who sat distant from the terrace , crosslegged on the lawn , his back to the party , presenting to her the long nape of his neck . His still , rejecting attitudealarmed her , and she realized now that earlier , when she had been talking about the party , he had not joined the discussion although , since he had been the first to hear of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Had he really repudiated her ? What else could explain the indifference of a boy of twelve to fireworks ? As she stared at the small , heavy-headed boy , the wheel began , in the dark vault of her heart , slowly to revolve . Terrorized and longing for the climax of her terror and knowing that her longing was obscene , she disciplinedherself , she could stop the wheel ; she took a deep breath and she held a whispered conference with Maureen , deflecting the nameless experience by concentrating on the tepidity of the water in the Guernsey pitcher , and telling the anxious girl for the fifth timep162that the sugar bowl she had broken was not of the slightest consequence . Surreptitiously looking at the watch pinned to the bosom of her dress , she saw that she must endure for the better part of an hour and as invisibly as she had departed from them , she returned to her guests . Miss Duff 's discourse on sprue was long . Dressed in umber from her trowel-shaped hat to her imported German walking shoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease which she had read that morning in a medical encyclopedia . There was no possible reason for her to imagine that this was Charles Smithwick 's complaint , but there was a general predilection in Hawthorne for the out-of-the-way or the archaic or the unlikely . Since no one specifically knew what he was suffering from ( the doctor would not say through over-scrupulosity and Beulah did not say perhaps because she knew how much her patronesses enjoyed guessing ) and the most obscure diseases had been proposed : yaws , fluke worms , psittacosis , dengue . Actually , they were all quite sure that it was only malaria but this they would not admit ; they would have looked on that as too banal to discuss . And the ordinary was not Hawthorne 's line . They enjoyed discussing termite mounds in Africa , witchcraft , medieval fin amour ; they could exchange receipts for sillibub and mead and directions for domesticatingcrows . And although they were staunchly Low Church and daily read The Book of Common Prayer , they also studied their horoscopes , took seriously Beulah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Barker 's house was haunted by the shades of seven aborigines who left their burying ground in the forest several nights a week to take turns sitting in a creaky Boston rocker in his upstairs hall . The Wainright-Lowes , who were not imaginative , often heard the clank of chains . It was not entirely unbelievablethat Peg Duff was sometimes troubled out of sleep by the cry of a moose cow that she had shot out of season , a felony for which Yankee Doodle Lafontaine had been obliged to hale her into court , to the delectationof the whole country , three quarters of whose populationhad come to the trial . It was Katharine 's father who had started this vogue , peopling his house with an august body of ghosts to whom he had given names from the novels of Thomas Hardy which he much admired ; and Katharine , continuingthe mythology as an essential part of Congreve House , had early taught the Shipley children and her servants to distinguish them one from the other by the sounds they made as they shuffled and padded through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubling the country quiet with their sighs and their soliloquies . Michael Henchard came to pity himself , running his stick along the balustrade and to make a sound like the cracking of nuts . And the room where Maeve had used to sleep was occupied by Eustachia Vye who knew no rest at all and wept and beat her breast until the cocks began to crow . At lunch today Honor had said , " I heard Tess rummaging through the sea-chest where you keep the croquet set , " and herp164twin , not to be outdone , said , " Jude had a frightful night . " Fondly Katharine watched her ancient playmates nibbling sandwiches . Their appetites were nearly as huge and simple as those of the village children who came in their Sunday best of linsey-woolsey knickerbockersand huckabuck shirts and of ruffled , rumpled organdy and tin barettes , to spill ice cream upon themselves and cry , not for the damage to their clothes , but for the loss of a single drop of food . And she thought how extremely pleasant her life of compromise among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give it up and go to live in Mangareva ; she knew herself sufficiently to know that she would never find in breadfruit trees a substitute for elms and she did not think that John could reproduce Merrion Square in palm thatch . She could not ( it had been lunacy ever to imagine it ) leave for naked Polynesians these vivaciouscreatures , brimming with gossip and personal style , loving to quote from Dr. Johnson 's dictionary , perpetually happy because their work was finished and all the demands upon them had been withdrawn and they were married to their houses and their habits and their infirmities . Miss Celia Heminway , for instance , a dry wisp lost in her wheel-chair , talking with such animation to Harriet , seemed , at this moment , to be absolutely indispensable to her . And because she knew that she was indispensable to Miss Heminway , she almost leaned forward to squeeze her crippled hand . Miss Heminway ,  |p165who  had read widely and was especially conversant in the novels of the nineteenth century and the memoirs of the court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own had faded , to read passages of Saint-Simon , at which she would laugh so hard that she had to extract a handkerchief from her little beaded pocketbook to dry the pink corners of her eyes . " Trust Katharine to find that mot again for me ! " she would cry . And Mrs. Wainright-Lowe trusted her to be an unfailing source of information on birds , and Mr. Barker relied on her to be , in his own words , " a bijou par excellence . " She could not leave any of them , certainly not this heavenly and preposterous Miss Duff who , having disposed of sprue , was now delivering Hawthorne 's pronouncementon the St. Denis choice of summer resort . Bingham Bay was the sort of place that catered to touristswith tearooms upon whose walls hung studies in water color of the Bristol lighthouse and with antique shops that sold , as well as china broody hens , the bone and raffia produce of Japan . It was a false , expensive , loud-mouthed mecca for arrivistes and Miss Duff said , " Bingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their right minds go there . Bar Harbor even worse , on a grander scale . Will fight day and night to keep hoi polloi out of Hawthorne . Ca n't have people mousingaround in emeralds and not enough clothes . " The two beagles that always attended her looked up lornly and she gave them each a piece of cake . " Went over to the Bay on my whizzer this afternoon to get boozep166do n't use any of their shops except for martini mixings  --  and saw John Shipley 's boat . Two big , half-naked blonde tarts for every one of those slinking Cuban men . It made me good and sore . " It would be out of the question to move out of the neighborhood where Peg Duff lived or where lived this beaming , baby-round and baby-bald old Mr. Barker who , having rejoiced in Peg 's performance ( no one had ever been able to determine whether or not she was a conscious comedienne ) now returned to his earlier tribute to the gardens of Congreve House and asked her to let her friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The secret is n't mine , " she said . " It belongs to Maddox and he 'll guard it with his life . My father used to claim that he was the son of a sorcerer and a sorceressand quite possibly he is and quite possibly he does say abracadabra by the light of the moon . " She paused and wishing still to draw Andrew into the circle , she said , " Andrew , do you know what Maddox does on moonlight nights ? " He heard her and he shook his head but he would not turn around and Edmund St. Denis chuckled , " Man at work . Do not disturb . " " He bays the moon , " said Honor , cheeky for the benefit of Raoul who looked at her and smiled faintly . " What does it mean , to bay the moon ? " " Merely to bark , " said the literal Miss Duff . " Doubtlesscomes from the same root , only a transitive verb in this case . "  | " Well , then he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stews newts ' eyes in brine . " Miss Heminway drolly shook her finger at Honor and to Katharine she said , " It shows the goodness of your heart , Katharine , that you let that cynical minx live with you . Do you know that last week , in this selfsamespot , she told me  --  in a most defiant tone , I must say  --  that she does n't believe in stars or ghosts . She says there 's no such thing as levitation . To hear her talk , you 'd think she thought her elders were insane . " " I do too believe in ghosts , Miss Heminway ! " the girl protested . " Why do you think the croquet set is up ? Because Tess made me think of it , rattling the balls in the sea-chest half the night last night so that I could n't sleep . Do you play croquet , Raoul ? " Poor Harriet , minding her manners , continued to smile and nod at Miss Heminway who , after her badinage with Honor , resumed telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant girlhood . But Katharine could see that Harriet was glancingnervously and angrily out of the corner of her eye at her sister engaged in this unfair campaign . Raoul shook his head and his father gave his shouldera push . " Then go and learn . No time like the present . " And he smiled a conniving , match-making smile at Katharine who , taking pity on Harriet , ordered all the young to go and play a round of croquet . The blond , long-limbed boy got up and ceremoniously bowed to everyone while Andrew , his back still to the company , went on ahead down the arching pergola.  |p168Everyone  turned to stare at the children as if youth were a curiosity not to be seen every day and Miss Heminway sighed , " Like something by Renoir . Those little girls , those lovely , lovely little girls . " Their black hair lay free and long across their shoulders and as Edmund St. Denis followed their light and laughing retreat , there came to his rubicund face , in which the slovenly flesh sagged away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if at last he had begun to remember the world of possibilities whose welcoming portals he had been too timorous to enter . " What would n't I give to be that fellow 's age ! " cried Brantley Wainright-Lowe . " Smoking Egyptian Prettieststo impress the girls , what ? I say that 's the life . " " He 's too young to smoke at all , " said Raoul 's mother . " But the young are not as young as we used to be . " " It 's not really smoking when those fancy brands are involved , " said Wainright-Lowe . " It 's just living up to the ad , Be nonchalant : light a Murad . ' And I repeat , I 'd give my worldly goods and all my expectationsto be a kid again . " " I would n't give a farthing , " snorted Mr. Barker . " I like being old . Would you want to be sixteen again , Katharine ? Sweet sixteen and never been kissed ? " She shook her head and gasped , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord , no ! What an appalling thought ! " Peg Duff said , " I was a tomboy then and I 'm a tomboynow . Never wanted to be kissed , never have been kissed . Like things just the way they are . " " Oh , so do I ! " agreed Katharine and she meant it ;  |p169she  would like to have this peaceful hour go on and on , with the sound of the twins ' carefree laughter and the cracking of the wooden balls coming to her , like a testimonialof security , across the sunny lawn and with these true friends around her offering her and each other their respect and their uninvolving love . " This is the most beautiful house I have ever seen , " said Madeleine St. Denis and she gazed upward reverently . " It is also charmed , " said Mrs. Wainright-Lowe . " Congreve House has always had a charmed life . The Congreves never have water trouble , to name but one of their divine rights . When the rest of us are buying Vichy water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lolling in their tubs like Roman senators . " " Found a mouse swimming in my well this morning , " said Miss Duff and patting the dog on her left , added , " Spotty killed the bad old mouse after I ladled it out , did n't the spotted doggie ? " " As the mistress is , so is the house , " said Mr. Barker who was a little deaf and had not heard Miss Duff 's unseemly revelation . He looked at Katharine , infatuated . " Could a queen live anywhere but in a palace ? " " She 's got no servant problems , " said Mrs. Tyler , a stout old widow famous for her inability to keep a cook longer than a month and equally famous for trying , always unsuccessfully , to steal the cooks of her friends . " Are you aware , Mrs. St. Denis , that this genius gardenerof hers simply materialized one day twenty fullp170years ago and has been here ever since ? I 'm lucky if I can get a high-school boy to come and cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Mrs. Tyler said , simply materialized one day in the rose garden when Katharine 's father was spraying his prize bushes . In the full tide of noon the strange boy had stood stockstilland breathing in the perfume of the profuse flowers he said , " I 'll work here . " No one ever knew where he came from nor what his antecedents were ; he had a faintly Nova Scotian accent and his coloring was Scotch . Celibate and unsociable , he was interested in nothing but flowers and shrubs and trees whose Latin names fell unaffectedly from his lips although he could not read or write . She wondered again what he did so late at night in his room in the stable and she knew that unless she snooped and spied , she would never find out , for he was a private man , as private as a child . " To say nothing of Mrs. Shea , " said Brantley Wainright-Lowe , " and Maureen and that other little Irish smasher , " and it was impossible to tell whether his leer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Katharine or her blue-eyed maids . " It 's no virtue in me that Maddox and Mrs. Shea stand by . He is wedded to the gardens and she is wedded to the house . Where would they go if they left me ? " " I 'd take them in a minute , " said Mrs. Tyler who lived in one of the ugliest houses in the town , a sepia shingled warren beset by rank spirea and shaggy bangs of wisteria that blinded every window . " If you everp171give up Congreve House , will you give them to me ? Hear , everybody , bear witness , I 'm first bidder . " " Give up Congreve House ? " The indignant cry sprang simultaneously to the lips of the five other Hawthornecitizens and by their glares they set the greedy infidel beyond the pale . " Give up Congreve House ' ! " Miss Heminway 's was a cry of pain . " What can you be proposing ? If KatharineCongreve gave up the house , I 'd have a warrant out for her arrest before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyler snickered unhappily and Katharinesoothed them all . " Perhaps I can find another Mrs. Shea for you . But I sha n't give up Congreve House . I shall be buried here under my own fig tree in my own backyard . ' " " That 's the sort of thing we mean about Congreve House and Maddox and all the rest of it , " said Mrs. Wainright-Lowe to the St. Denises , personally envious but publicly proud . " There really is a fig tree beside George Congreve 's grave . It is put to bed in the winter in a contraption comfortable enough for a person to be buried in . " " Ceremony twice a year , " said Peg Duff . " Bedding down of the Congreve fig tree in the fall , ascension of the fig tree in the spring . A movable feast , to be sure , depending on the frost . " Small silences fell as the western sky began to redden . The tea was tepid and the cake was gone and there was no reason for them all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; not one of themp172had broached the subject of her lamp that had burned all night . And finally , as if she were rewarding good children , she said , " I could not sleep last night . " They clucked their tongues as if she had given them a piece of news . " I was planning my party , " she said . " I was making lists . " " Oh , lists ! " exclaimed Miss Heminway , to whom the making of lists was tantamount to a vocation ; now , because her hands were stiffened with arthritis , it was a labor but it was still a labor of love . " I , too , would far rather make lists than sleep . But I so seldom have a legitimate one to make . " Her voice was plaintive ; she seemed to look back on halcyon times of inventories . Now that the matter was out in the open , they all gave themselves away . Mr. Barker said he had thought she was reading Gone with the Wind and Mrs. Wainright-Lowesaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardon and Peg herself said that she had concluded Kate imagined that she smelled fire , the notion having lodged in her mind earlier in the evening when they were all looking at the cactuses . " Glad it was nothing worse than lists , " said Mr. Barker and winking at Mrs. St. Denis he said , " I 'm the lowbrow here . I read Gone with the Wind . In fact I ate it up . " He signaled to his chauffeur at the foot of the drive , and now the prolonged adieux began and the exchange of invitations , the apologies for drinking so much tea and eating so much cake , the reiteration that this day was beautiful and that the rest of the world did not know what it was missing by not living in Haw/thorne , the admonition to Katharine that she must not stay up again all night . Miss Duff was the first to go , striding down the drive like a soldier , loudly ordering her dogs to " March ! " Presently only Edmund and Madeleine were left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their island off the coast at Bingham Bay after dark , went around the house to take her son away from the croquet game and when she was gone , Edmund said , " You are a wonder , Kate . You have n't changed at all . " " Oh , no , I have n't changed , " she answered . His wistfulscrutiny broke her heart . His jowled face was mottled with the sort of colors , mauve and washed red and yellow , that appeared on picture postal cards from Venice . " Not changing is my only occupation . " " I think your fuddy-duddy old friends are grand . I think you 're grand . " He crossed the terrace to sit beside her and he said , " You ought to have married , Katharine . " " But if I had married , then I might have changed and changed in a way you would n't have liked . " " Maybe so . Still , I think . . . I 'm going to speak freely , Kate , we 're old enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to say what 's on my mind and tell you that you ought to have married me . " The impropriety was so unexpected that she could not reply but could only stare at his soft pink mouth , much smaller than she had remembered it to be . But he did not expect a reply and he went on in the same downhearted voice , " A man does n't really know whatp174he wants until he 's forty , but why should the poor devil be penalized just because he was brought up wrong , too damned ignorant to know that nine times out of ten the woman he marries is never the woman he needs ? " It was a gross and platitudinous burlesque of John Shipley 's protestations , and the man was neither better nor worse than John in his effort to struggle out of his boredom and his disappointment in himself by pleading with her to build him a castle in Spain and take him on a magic carpet to the end of the rainbow . " A man needs a woman to inspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make or break a man . I am not implying that Madeleine has broken ' me . Madeleine would n't hurt a fly  --  maybe that 's just the trouble , maybe if she had put up a fight on some issue or other , I would n't feel now that the starch was out of me . " The piteous , self-conceited jeremiad went on ; he bent his head , staring at his hands that he kneaded steadily . " I think I could have been a painter . I might even be able to paint now . " ( John could have been a Bulfinch , could be one now . ) He did not look at her as John had not looked at her when he declared that he was in love with her . " I 'm a married man , I 've got a son , and I swear I 've fought against this feeling , but I ca n't win . I knew the minute I saw you again after all these years that I should n't have rested until I got you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful life together , you and I. " A loon cried in the reeds of the marsh and a single whippoorwill prematurely began nearby in the meadow.  |p175She  heard the children 's voices as they came back through the pergola and then Madeleine 's as she urged Raoul to hurry , " Please , son , I 'm leery of the water after dark . " " You think about what I 've said , hear ? " Edmund lifted his head and looked at her and wanly smiled . " The first thing I 'll do is forget what you 've said . " . " Do n't be like that , Katharine . Do n't sound so angry . I surely did n't take you by surprise . You surely must have seen that I 'm crazy mad about you . " Fatigue after the long night and the long day had been gathering for the last hour in her muscles and in her brain and she had to think of each part of the process of standing up and of saying to him , " Wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The improbableexchange between them was as remote and indistinctas , suddenly , Edmund 's face was ; it seemed to fade to a wavering ectoplasm . She said , " I 'm terribly tired . I did n't sleep last night . " " It sometimes happens like that , " he said , his normal voice practical and self-assured . " You go through the day and then it hits you all of a heap . " Andrew came running across the lawn . The game , which he and Harriet had won , had lightened his spirits and he devoured the remaining sandwiches , having refused to eat anything before . " Harriet said there was a letter from Daddy . Are they going to Germany because if they are . . . Cousin Katharine ? Cousin Katharine ? Are you sick ? " Green clouds rose , layer after layer , for the sun/like Catherine wheel , the absolute , unburying itself and edging up behind the dogs ' backs of tremendous waves . The inseparable mind sang in its bone-cell and she was wheeled outward swiftly and the purblind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone and luminous blood , singing with the music of the spheres.  |p177No  ONE in Hawthorne could remember a midsummer more comely than this . The genial rains fell in the night , spoiling no one 's picnic plans or boating parties and keeping the wells and cisterns full . The elegant blue hydrangeas and the splendid lawns , sweeping downward to the river or to the lake , ripened coolly under the faithful sun . Everyone looked satisfied . Peoplepassing on the road in front of Congreve House whistled and sometimes sang and saluted Maddox in the rosary and Mrs. Shea pottering about the kitchen garden . The birds had never been more various nor voluble , fluting and trilling in the shrubs and thickets ; on the lake , coots clucked deeply and two dapper cardinals came to live in the grape arbor . Cousin Katharine had to send away for another bird ledger because she usedp178up the last page of the old one before July was half over . The bells , ringing for services and ringing for the hours , partook of this tranquil jubilation and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even Mrs. Shea , a saturnine woman , was inoculated with the summerand in her singular good humour , she attended Beth in her childbed although heretofore she had never approved of cats , finding them wanton in their promiscuitywith their own sons and grandsons ; she accompaniedthe parturient purrs with " Lord Randal " and ordered Maureen to warm a bowl of milk for the brave mother who bore a litter of six . For Andrew , though , the days lumbered on as slowly as they had done in June almost without incident . There had been one resplendent afternoon with Victor , but only one , so that afterward his loneliness was twice as great as it had been before . Cousin Katharine had got tickets to a circus for them and because Victor looked on an invitation from her as a command and also because Charles was on the mend and needed less attention now , he accepted enthusiastically ; his spirits were obviously dampened when he discovered that Cousin Katharine was not going with them but he was mollified when she told Adam to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way through town , Victor bowed and waved an imaginary hat and Billy Bartholomew looked up from his whittling and called , " You the personal representative of Lord Nelson ? " The circus was small and undistinguished but they saw a man eat a live rat and they had an instructive con/versation with a hermaphrodite ( Victor , though , was skeptical and quoting the everlasting Mr. Knowitall , Charles , said such people were fourflushers ) . They had seen a girl lion-tamer who was very skillful but who cared so little for her personal appearance that her dirty yellow hair was tied up with a shoe-lace and her bodice was held together at the back with a horse-blanket pin . They had ridden the Ferris wheel and had bought chameleons and Victor had won a swagger stick in the shooting gallery which he gave to Andrew to take to Cousin Katharine . It had been exactly like old times , for after the circus they had gone to the smoke-house and , grimacing , had eaten their handouts until Victor remembered the rat the circus man had eaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can of gurry . They had gone to the store for tonic and had drunk it on the porch , watching and ridiculing the people who passed by , as much at home with each other as if nothing at all had happened and this afternoon had been preceded by others like it . Andrew tried to appear as casual as his friend but his laughter sometimes sounded hysterical , his praise was fulsome and he could not stop issuing further invitations to Victor who either refused or pretended that he did not hear . When Jasper Freeman had a fit beside the horse trough and the Black Maria came to take him home , Andrew laughed too loud though , in fact , he had never found the spectacle in the least funny and Victor told him frigidly to grow up . But Victor had been the one who had started it , long ago . Em Bugtown was onp180the loose , whining for Copenhagen from every passer-by , but Victor barely noticed her . They went to call on Billy who , before he even said hello , read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are married in sackcloth . " An ugly stream of laughter jetted from his mouth and then he welcomed his visitors , pointed to a lard can full of cherries that they might eat and opening The Northern Farmer , read them a joke . It was a dialogue dealing with the taciturnityof New England farmers and Billy read it with lugubrious solemnity : " Morning , Si . " Morning , Josh . " What 'd you feed your horse for bots ? " Turpentine . " Morning , Si . " Morning , Josh . " Two days later : " Morning , Si . " Morning , Josh . " What 'd you say you fed your horse for bots ? " Turpentine . " Killed mine . " Mine too . " Morning , Si . " Morning , Josh . " Andrew had thought it an excellent joke but no one at Congreve douse had even grinned when he repeatedp181it . He seemed , even in such small matters as the telling of jokes , to be doomed this summer to failure . They had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone home by way of the lake , plunging through Billy 's unkempt field , littered with scraps of machinery and the foundations of outbuildings that would never be finished ; in his shiftless garden , the lettuce , gone to seed , was as tall as cosmos and the cabbageswere striated with the black tunnels of worms . The whole place , in the fading light , had the look of ruin and the sight of it made Andrew heavy-hearted . At the lake , they bathed their faces and took off their shoes and socks and then , with their feet in the water , they lay down , their heads pillowed on mounds of moss . From far away they heard the chug and whistle of the evening train going its leisurely way to Portland and presently the first star came out ; automatically , Andrew wished on it , but he had the feeling , uncomfortable and deep , that even if Charles Smithwick vanished , things still would not be the same between him and Victor . He tried to question Victor about his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , you know , storms and stuff . . . I du n no . You 'd have to get him to tell you himself . " " Would he , do you think ? Could I come and see him ? " " I 'd like to ask you , but Charles is funny that way . I mean he says when he 's telling a story two 's company and three 's a crowd . " There was no doubt about it , the son of a bitch hadp182poisoned Victor against him . Three might be a crowd to some people but Andrew would bet dollars to doughnutsthat Charles Smithwick liked big audiences for his boasting and his lies . He would bet anything that he invited every man and boy in Hawthorne except Andrew to lend him his ear . Victor had nothing to say to him and all the way across the lake when Andrew was rowing him home , he yodeled . When he got out of the boat all he said was " See you in the funny papers . " Nothing had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly reacted at all when he put its corpse on her missal ; it was leglessness in creatures she objected to . Cousin Katharine had her picnic on Stork Island but Charles was sick again and he and Victor did not come , and so , instead of them , Raoul St. Denis came , bringing his house-guest , a brash seventeen-year-olddandy from Mobile named James Partridge , who had a mandolin and , inhaling , smoked Lucky Strikes , and who so swept Honor and Harriet off their feet that for days afterward they mooned and could not eat and when they were not writing in their diaries , stood looking at themselves in mirrors , stunned with foolishness . They wanted to fly a Confederate flag from the barn . But while there had been no change in Andrew 's life and the events of it had been little more than a way to pass the time , there was a profound and unnameable change in Congreve House that affected everyone and had begun , he thought , to take place on that remarkablep183day when Cousin Katharine , renowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Andrew knew why she had fainted ; she had been overwhelmed by what her intuition had discovered to her about him ; she had looked him in the eye and seen that he was a murderer . It was enough to make anyone pass out . There had been nothing he could do about it , for the die was cast and he could not silence the voice inside him that perpetually sentenced Charles to death . From Cousin Katharine down to Adam , they all appeared , like Andrew , to be anticipating something ; there was that sense of an impending storm which is a kind of taut quiescence or a sort of premonition of disclosure as if , at any moment , the firmament will be slashed open by the lances of lightning to reveal , if one 's eyes are quick enough , the angels and the thrones of heaven . This mood was nothing like the stale blight of the winterpast but had an invigorating element in it , so that while they waited , the members of the household were ceaselessly busy and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life , stirred himself to build a doll house for a favored niece and to learn how to add and subtract on a Chinese abacus he had found in the barn . The twins were frequently fetched by Raoul and James in the latter 's jazzy yellow roadster to go to rustic square-dancing parties or evening sails on the tourist steamers at Bingham Bay . And when she did not dine out , leaving the house in full and magnificent regaliaat eight o'clock , Cousin Katharine entertained and though her guests were the same old ones and the eve/ning 's routine was the same  --  after dinner she played the virginals for a few minutes and then the company moved to the card tables except for Mr. Barker and Miss Duff who played a cutthroat game of chess  --  the air was gayer than it had ever been . One might have thought that Cousin Katharine , like Maureen and like the twins , was in love . But Andrew knew better . He knew that all this contagious gaiety was made up and what it was was really her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night to hear her moving around in her room which was on the front of the house next to his and he knew that she was standing guard to see that he did not slip out of the house and down to the lake to row across and murder Charles in his sleep . Poor Cousin Katharine ! It was a terrible secret for her to have to keep . She talked continuously of the fireworks ball in August and the twins , who really did think she was in love ( they always imposed their own state of mind on everyone around them ) , amused themselves by imagining that on that night a lover would appear and she would announceher engagement to him  --  that Ronnie Pryce , perhaps , back from Australia and less talkative now , or Max Pirsch who had had a dueling scar . However , she repeated whenever they asked , that the only thing special about this party was that it was to be unusually big and unusually elaborate but that it was to commemorate nothing more than another of Hawthorne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular tradition , " an estival Thanksgiving , " she said , " when we 'll give our prayerful thanks for roses instead of pumpkinsp185and phoebes instead of turkeys . " The whole town talked of the party too and they assured one another that the fireworks show she would put on would be twice as sensationalas any municipal display on the Fourth of July ; Billy Bartholomew predicted that she would burn up the woods with her folderol but no one listened to him . There was an altogether groundless rumor that there was to be a set-piece of Old Ironsides . Andrew , for his part , was not sure what she was planningunless she meant to send for the plainclothesmen to take him away that night . It was very clever if that was what she intended to do , for in all the confusion , no one would notice even if they handcuffed him . The town talked also , rather less openly , of something else that had already happened at Congreve House , something that altogether baffled Andrew . For his unfathomablecousin had done the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tombstone made by astonecutter in Thomas and once a week she drove overto see it as if she were going for a fitting for a dress . People of a sanguine cast of mind accepted her tossedoffexplanation that there was nothing more morbid inordering a tombstone than in making a will . Mr. Barker , in fact , thought it so excellent an idea that he consideredhaving his own made and drafted several designs , butin the end he decided to be cremated and sent for illustratedbrochures of urns which Cousin Katharine studiedwith him . " No one will make monkeys out of us whenwe are dead , eh , Kate ? " the old man laughed . " We'llp186see to it that our houses are made in the style we are accustomed to . " But Mrs. Tyler , who was a pessimist , and Miss Duff , who was going straight through her medical encyclopediathis summer and whose thought , therefore , was largely dominated by disease ( last year it had been the evolution of the automobile and Brantley WainrightLowehad said that if she used the word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , connected Katharine 's act with her fainting spell and a frequent absence of her mind . One day , Andrew , bearing a message from his cousin to her neighbor , had stopped under Miss Duff 's open windows , drawn irresistibly to listen to the ladies ' low-pitched voices , and he heard Miss Duff say , " Carcinomaof the breast or I 'm a dead man , so it may be just as well she 's getting ready . Must say I hate to think of Katharine pushing up the daisies , as they say , but when you 're called , you 're called and that 's that and no two ways about it . " Mrs. Tyler , who knew a thing or two herself , was inclined to suspect angina pectoris but , being shouted down by her friend , asked for evidence and was told , " Have n't got any , but have a distinct feeling . Usually right about these things . Knew about Dan Thornton 's cirrhosis before the doctors did . Long be-fore . " Honor and Harriet thought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were growing more and more conventional . The maids and Mrs. Shea said she was tempting fate and Beulah Smithwick ghoul/ishly said , " If you ask me to run up your winding sheet , I 'll refuse point blank . " Andrew did not know what to make of it and he was inclined to accept it as he had accepted all her other caprices ( her manufacture of gunpowder , for example , and her passion , one year , for collecting swords ) , although , from time to time , he wondered if perhaps she did have some knowledge of her death , told her in a dream . ( Miss Duff 's theory was too ridiculous to considerfor a minute . ) Whatever her motive was , she had succeeded in doubling Andrew 's interest in death , and he often went to stand beside his great-uncle 's cedarshadedgrave , trying to imagine what the skeleton looked like and whether the shroud had rotted away ; he roamed the churchyard at St. James 's and he scrutinized the dead bodies of birds , slain by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mice pinched to death in traps in the pantry . He began to have dreams of Charles Smithwick from which he awoke in a guilty sweat and some of which propelled him into sleepwalking . He loved to think about these nightmares afterward although they terrified him at the time and one night when he woke to find himself downstairs in the library , he screamed , partly from shock and partly from astonishment at the phenomenalpower of the dream that had physically carried him , sound asleep , all the way from his bed to this pitchdarkroom . Cousin Katharine had heard him and she came downstairs to lead him back to bed . When she had asked him to tell her the dream , he could only babblep188incoherently but long after she had left his room , he reviewed its ominous details . He had dreamed that he was in the picking garden hunting for Cousin Katharine 's shears which she had dropped . The sun had set and the night was coming on ; Congreve House was no longer white but was brown stone , domed like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Charles Smithwick , wearing a long beard , lying on the cement entry and when he tried to open the door to see if he were really dead , a black dog ran out from a shed and standing on his hind legs , bit at Andrew 's neck . Then Charles , clean-shaven , loomed up over a little rise , carrying a gun and two dead birds . He called off the dog and came close to Andrew and he said , " We must not kill birds . I never kill birds , " but he was carrying two and the gouts of their blood shone on his trousers . Andrew knew at once that Charles was both dead and mad , and in his wanderings through the house and grounds , he found the evidences of it everywhere , for it was the dead lunatic 's whim to strew enigmas as he restlessly roamed , scattering them on the lawns , pinning them to trees , to walls or to the backs of chairs . In Minerva 's temple , Andrew found one on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I must have golden gold at once , " and in the library he had pasted a banner over the front of the bird cage and this one read , " My coat of dove , my glove of deer . " When Cousin Katharine had turned the light on , she had found him standing right there , beside the finches.  |p189Not  long before the fireworks party , Cousin Katharine and the twins went off one morning to the state prison where Cousin Katharine annually bought the handicraft of the convicts to give away as Christmas presents to maids and godchildren . Andrew , alone in the house , was glum and when the summer 's record for fair days was broken by a black rain that began to fall at noon and he knew his cousin and sisters would not be home in time for lunch , he settled into a monotonous dark mood . He could not put his mind to anything and his dissatisfactionmade every act an effort of the will . At his lonely lunch , he had to think each time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been careful , his water glass would have slipped from his insentient hand . He ate the peas on his plate one by one , maddening Maureen . Afterward , he tried to read and could not ; he put together a few pieces of a jigsaw puzzle but it was much too easy . He stared at each object that entered his range of vision as if he had never seen it before , but there was no excitement in his discovery , only a kind of dull confusion . That is , there was no excitement until it occurred to him to become a detective for the course of the next hour or so and , like Victor in the shut-up houses , examinehis cousin 's history through her belongings . He pretended that he did not know her and that he had been sent as a spy to her house ; sniffing and prying andp190listening , he wandered in and out of the crowded rooms , lingering occasionally in the long windows to gaze out at the roiled waters of the lake . Once , for no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the rain went on . " The devil is beating his wife , " he said and his voice seemed not to come from him at all . He moved toilsomely , pausing to wonder what vagary had caused Cousin Katharine to buy or to be given a cabbage rose carved of bone and having no other purpose than to lie alone on an austere marble mantelpiece in a back bedroom ; he debated which of the objects in the house were gifts and which were purchases . The milk-glass cuspidor , he knew , had been used for its intended purpose until Cousin Katharine had wrested it from a quiet old gentlemanin Bath by staking ten dollars against it in a local election . From a Japanese friend of her father 's had come the Samurai sword she used to prune the Dutchman's-pipethat grew over her windows ; lopping and brandishing , she sometimes sang " The Volga Boatmen " in a stylish contralto to the delight of Miss Duff who generally came right over and stood below , watching . When Cousin Katharine had finished , she called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fun than a basket of chips . " He examined , in cabinets and miniature desks and lacquered boxes and in jewel cases , on hanging what-nots and in sewing drums the accumulation of four generations . There were banjo clocks and music boxes that played minuets ; embroidered nightcap holders and stuffed owls ; in nooks and turnings there were Chinese vases filled with petrified cat-tails and furry grasses asp191old as Mr. Barker . There were porcelain umbrella stands and trivets in the shape of ducks ; there was a leather fire bucket and an artificial cedar tree of jade . In drawers , there were Japanese fans whose silk had rotted from the ivory stays , Spanish lace and Spanish combs , magnifyingglasses mounted on bamboo . There were snuff boxes , camel bells , and scores of ornamental wooden boxes that contained the testimonials of moods and enthusiasmsand friendships , ribbons and seashells and colored stones gathered for the sake of the gathering on beaches and along the banks of rivers ; fragments of wedding cake in cheesecloth bags ; scraps of Mechlin , of tribute silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of velvet , solitary chamois gloves , bald buckram waistbands . There were strawberry emeries and coveredcorks for bone bodkins and decorated darning eggs and cases for tapestry needles . There were marbles , jackstones , fish hooks , chessmen , golf tees , corks with silver tops in the likeness of Henry VIII and Theodore Roosevelt , water bowls from Chinese bird cages , a campaign button that pledged its wearer to vote for Grover Cleveland . In the library , on a big round table , covered with gold-tasseled gray velvet , there were , behind the porringersand christening cups , a multitude of photographs of relatives and friends . Andrew and his sisters were there , immortalized in drooping bathing suits ; each held a lobster by the tail and grimaced dreadfully although it was clear that the brutes were dead . His parents were present many times : on their wedding day they stoodp192before the front windows of the drawing room in CongreveHouse and stiffly held up glasses of champagne ; they posed on a beach before a dwindling Roman ruin with a company of men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pictures showed them with Cousin Katharine , ankle-deep in shamrocks beside the River Boyne , drinking tea on a steamer crossing Loch Katrine , strolling through the Arboretum on Lilac Sunday . In one of them , the two girls sat on the lawn at Congreve House , plucking the petals from black-eyed Susans to learn if they were loved or not and John Shipley , a book closed over his thumb , lay in the hammock , looking fondly down at them . " Get out of my hammock , you drip , " said Andrew and turned the picture face down on the table . Here in this room an investigator saw that the lady of the house did needlepoint but not for long at any time because beside her easel there was a table piled with books and magazines : she was reading , at this time , Henry Esmond , Bulfinch 's Mythology , an old cook book , The Illustrated London News . Even if he had not known her , he would have seen that she did not keep her mind on anything for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a second table on which she had half finished a game of Canfield . He edged slowly up the stairs , and considered going into his room to work on a model of the State House that he was assembling but then he remembered that he had run out of mucilage . Besides , the box of parts was in the top drawer of his bureau and he felt like a criminalp193each time he opened it because he had never mailed the letters to his parents that Honor had given him weeks rgo . He had not read them after all , for he had not dared know what Cousin Katharine had said about him , but he flinched each time he saw the neat , stamped pile . The loud , toneless rain shut out all the sounds from downstairs and he felt as if this were the middle of the night and everyone was asleep except himself . All the bedroom doors were closed and the long corridor was full of shadows and the smell of dank . He thought of exploring the attic , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some perfectly awful lie such as that his father was a Hindu convert and slept on a bed of nails , but Mrs. Shea was in a bossy mood today and doubtless would n't listen . And for a moment he thought of paying a call on Maddox but he gave up the idea when he remembered how short-tempered Maddox was on days when he had to stay indoors . Adam was gone with the carriage and the maids made him shy . Aimlessly he went into Harriet 's room and examined her collection of ceramic pigs . What on earth she had them for he could not guess ; incongruous garlands of dainty flowers girdled their necks and their round flanks were branded with arabesques and hearts and some of them had gilded ears . She had an equally worthless assortment of souvenir spoons , some with heart-shaped bowls , others with bowls like shovels and like arrowheads ; one had a mosaic handle and all of them bore some legend that could not possibly have meant less to her : St. Louis World 's Fair , From Colvin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of dresses and her bureau drawers full of lace-edged underpants and all the scarves she never wore . A lanky French doll lay on a frilly baby-pillow on the bed . He picked up her Line-a-Day from her desk and finding that it was locked , he rummaged like a burglar through the jewel box and through the drawers again but he could not find the key . He did discover , to his mild titillation , a box of dark blue eyeshadow secreted in a handkerchief case . Finally he gave up and went into Honor 's room , but her diary was also locked and the key was nowhere to be found . He wrinkled his nose with distaste when he found a piece of paper on top of her bookcase on which she had been canceling out the letters in her name and the name of the Alabama boy , James Partridge , to determine whether their relationship was to be one of friendship , courtship , love or marriage : Jamei Partridge ( courtship ) Honoy h jpl  --  y ( marriage ) With her small fountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a moron . " Kneeling at his sister 's window , he singsonged , " Rain , rain , go to Spain , never come back here again . Rain , rain , go away , come back on another day . " He repeated the jingles until the words lost their meaning and becameno more than syllables . Then , tired of that , he read a little in a book called The Language of Flowers which bore the name Katharine Congreve in a childish hand on the flyleaf . He learned that mistletoe signified " I surmount difficulties " and that whortleberry , whateverthat might be , meant " Treason . " Back in the spooky corridor , he mechanically opened every door on the west side  --  the huge linen closet smelling of pine soap ; the bathroom with cold marble surfaces and the longest tub in the world and a mirror opposite so that while one bathed one could make faces at oneself , a far cry from Cousin Katharine 's days in convent school when all the mirrors had been taken down from the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they got into the water . How did the nuns themselves take baths , he wondered , thinking of his mother 's cook 's sisters whose habits looked to be a permanent integument like fur or feathers . Next to the bathroom was a storeroom filled with boxes neatly labeled " Kitchen Curtains , " " Lamp Chimneys , " " Coat Hangers &; Shoe Trees . " After that there was the sewingroom where two ample-bosomed , wasp-waisted dummies , armless and legless and with a curved hook for a head , stood , sentry-like , on either side of the Singer ; around the middle of one of them , he tied a girdle of bias tape ; he filled a bobbin with green silk thread , wrote " Beware " with a piece of chalk on an old billiard table piled with bolts of cloth , and bifurcated the room with a tidy row of buttons , alternating black and white . The last of the rooms on this side of the house was Eustachia Vye 's . It was never used except once in a blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ago , when he and the twins had still been veryp196small and had needed the governess , it had been Miss Bowman 's room and he remembered how , somewhat to Cousin Katharine 's annoyance , she had converted it into a schoolish place , hanging up maps in place of Godey 's ladies and substituting for the graceful little escritoire a sturdy golden oak office desk which she had had sent up from Boston , causing everyone trouble . There were no signs of Bowman here now . Indeed , there were no signs of anyone , for this was unlike any other room in the full house ; it was swept and dead ; its narrow , stripped-down bed had an air of final vacancy as if its occupant had been carried away to a coffin , as if it really were inhabited by a ghost beyond the need of any creature comforts . And yet , by contrast , the open desk showed letter paper and a full inkwell , ready for a guest , and a vase of roses so fresh that they must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chest of drawers . Light books for summer reading were lined up between two square Chinese vases on the bedside table , Lear 's Nonsense Rhymes , The Memoirs of a Midget , The Green Hat . Still in its wrapping , a cake of Pears lay in the soap dish on the commode and the towels on the rack were fresh . But the naked mattress and the frame of the bed , disrobed of its tester , were inhospitable ; it was like a carcass picked by birds . He looked into the closet and found nothing there but an enormous empty hatbox from a shop in Paris . The drawers of the desk and the dressingtable were empty ; there was nothing in the sewing drum except a length of gray grosgrain ribbon , and onp197the shelves of a three-tiered what-not there was only a yellow pear made of wax with a hinged section in it , like a drop seat , which , when it was opened , revealed a minute creche half lost in cotton . And then his eye fell on a little box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katharine always carried with her , extracting from it lemon drops that she gave to children she encountered . She must have left it here , he reasoned , when she brought in the flowers , and though he found it peculiar that there should be flowers in this forsaken room , he found it even more peculiar that she had left the box behind . He had not imagined it had any existence except when she was making up to a child , just as umbrellas seemed to dematerialize betweenrainstorms . He opened the box to take a candy out and noticed , as he had not done before , that there was a photograph slipped into the inside of the lid . It was a picture of his mother and Cousin Katharine as girls , examining the wares of a lace vendor before the doors of Chartres , and on the back of it was written , " Maeve and I buying scandalous lace gloves . M. in a black mood because of her eczema which is so severe that Sister Chrysostom thinks her skin may be permanentlypitted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hummocks that often appeared on his own chin ? He looked closely at the photograph again but he could see no mutilation of his mother 's wide-eyed , lovely face . So tall that they dwarfed the lace vendor even in her high medieval headdress , the girls , hatless andp198wearing their dark hair in buns at their necks , gazed tranquilly into the camera , their arms entwined . An arresting hypothesis came into his mind : if this Sister Chrysostom had been right , he doubted that his father would have married his mother , because he could not bear disfigurement of any kind ( he could hardly endure the sight of Honor whenever she had hives and when the three of them had had chicken-pox , he talked with them through the closed doors of their rooms and never once came in ) . In that event , he probably would have married Cousin Katharine who , then , would have been Andrew 's mother . But would Andrew have been the same person ? Would he have been born to Katharineon the same day and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Maeve ? And would he be standing here now in this little room , and would the rain be coming down so madly at this very hour if his father had married the girl on the left instead of the one on the right ? A distant , uncompleted trumpeting of thunder startled him and he looked out the window . The stable was directlyopposite this room and in the gardener 's room , he saw a light-globe burning . Immediately , as if at a signal , Maddox 's face appeared ; he flattened his nose against the pane like a child and scowled . The rain was heavier than ever , lunging against the windows and lashing the tops of the maple trees and making a swift muddy river down the drive . The gardens would be a mess and Maddox would not be fit to live with for a week . For a moment Andrew watched Maddox , whop199did nothing but glower at the ruinous downpour but Andrew felt as if those angry eyes had caught him redhandedin some wickedness and he moved backward from the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . Taking the lemon-drop box , he went across the hall to put it in his cousin 's sitting room , partly out of thoughtfulness and partly as an excuse to lie on the chaise longue , an article of furniture he liked next best to a hammock . Beth and her family of six blind , naked kittens lay in a basket lined with flower-printed cotton flannel ; the mother cat stretched her neck to be petted and purred loudly , narrowing her perspicacious eyes . If Cousin Katharine were his mother . . . Taking up this speculation again as he lay on the chaise longue and stared up at the ceiling , he presented himself with questions and problems as if he were taking an examination . Would Cousin Maeve , in that case , be at the state prison today or would she be in Dublin , about to leave for France ? Would it be Katharine who followed Paris styles and Maeve who wore what she wanted to regardlessof fashion ? He proposed a series of substitutions , imagined his mother in Cousin Katharine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys from Harvard and , on other days , walking up to Mount Vernon Street to the Shipleys ' house . It was all unthinkable , really , because his mother would never dare to do the things his cousin did . It would never occur to her , for example , to take up Botany as Cousin Katharine had done for one semester atp200Radcliffe . When she bought a microscope and announced her intention of watching the sex cells of slime-mold conjugate , Mrs. Shipley had put her hands over her ears and cried , " Slime mold ? For pity 's sake , do n't tell me what it is ! " To use one of Bowman 's favourite expressions , his mother had no " intellectual curiosity . " He changed his tack , pretending now that Cousin Katharine , as his mother , was the person she had always been and that his mother , as Cousin Maeve , was that rather vague , somehow always slightly worried , rather humble , faintly discouraging woman to whom he returnedon winter afternoons . How much nicer it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of the other way around ! He remembered a typical day last February when it had seemed to him that all the careworn futility of being alive in the winter was crystallized in the person of his mother who , even while she accepted confidences and soothed tears and laughed at jokes , never gave herself up wholly but kept preoccupied with the mechanics of existence : her mind was always elsewhere  --  it was on the message that had come up from the kitchen that the alligator pear was bad , it was on the failure of the window-washers to appear , or the error in the address that Shreve , Crump and Low had printed on invitations to a party . If he came to her , bearing like a gift the intelligence that the word " hippocampine " meant " of or pertaining to seahorses , " she did not ignore him and , in fact , she showed a considerable interest , but it was polite and after much too short an interval in which her questionsp201were much too perfunctory , she was as likely as not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call the men about oiling the books , " and to take up a pencil and write a note to herself ; Cousin Katharine , on the other hand , would have written down hippocampine . On that particular afternoon that came back to him today , he had gone to call on Cousin Katharine and had been wholly frustrated for she had to break her promise to show him a slide of tap water because , in the first place , an uninvited guest was announced , a doctor by the name of Codman who spent the time disrespectfullyfingering the beard of a bust of Shakespeare and importunately telling Cousin Katharine that she ought to learn to drive a car . And then , just after he left and they had adjusted the microscope , Andrew 's father came . Failing to see his son at first , he said , " Well , thank the Lord , I find you alone , " and then , " Oh , blast and damn  --  forgive me , Katharine  --  I left my briefcase in the hall . Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chap ? " He had drawn up a design for a guest house for Cousin Katharine , he said , and he wanted to go over it with her . When Andrew came back , his father commenced to shuffle through papers and to drum his fingers on the tea table and then he abruptly looked up and said irritably , " Do you mind if you cut your botanizing short today and go along home ? I have only a few minutes to get through this business with your cousin . " Cousin Katharine herself had let him out and winking at him just before she stooped to press her cool cheek againstp202his , she said , " What a fusser he is ! But since he 's doing it for me free , I ca n't look a gift-horse in the mouth . " He had been about to ask her where the guest house was to be and who were to be the guests who would sleep in it , but her manner hurried him and as he walked home through the cold , mean dusk , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a dinner dress on his mother 's bed and his mother was at her dressing table brushing her hair . " You 're early . I thought you were having tea with Cousin Katharine and boning up on tobacco diseases . Was n't it very gay there ? " " No , not very , " he said . " Dr. Codman was there at first . And Daddy afterward . Just as we were starting to look at tap water . " " Tap water ? What 's botanical about that ? " " Bacteria , " he said . " You probably would n't drink it if you knew what was in it . It 's alive . " " Really ? I never heard of that before . I wondered where Daddy was . Darling , you terribly need a haircut . " She began to brush her hair again . " It does n't matter that he did n't come home because there was no tea today anyhow . We 're going out for dinner . " The purling of a pigeon on the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely the way the sound of a night train could do or the look of a dog staring through a window . " I do n't see why he ca n't let her come to his office at a regular time . Why does he have to spoil the slide she made ? "  | " But if it 's only tap water , sweetheart , she can make dozens , ca n't she ? " " You would n't understand , " he said but so softly that she did not hear . He watched her in the soft and facile light that came from under the small pink silk shades that sat like parasols upon the crooks of two dead-white Dresden shepherd boys . From across the room he could smell her perfume ; she smelled delicious , but she smelled like all her friends who bought their perfume on the Champs Elysees at the same shop and discussed the price of it , dispelling , thereby , half its magic . Cousin Katharine 's , on the other hand , was brewed secretly by Maddox . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . " I do n't know . I did n't like him . He had a dead front tooth . " " I expect he could have that taken care of . Dentists are growing awfully clever . Did he do something offen-sive ? " He told his mother how the doctor , as he was leaving , ostentatiously reminded Cousin Katharine of the present of red roses he had brought to her and said , " An aspirin will help keep them . And be sure to cut the stems each day , " to which Cousin Katharine replied with sincere thanks for his thoughtfulness . But when she came back after seeing him out she sharply fanned up the fire with the bellows as if she were attacking someone and said , " Cut the stems indeed ! I know ofp204nothing that annoys me more than to be instructed in matters I took in with my mother 's milk . The curse of being female , Andrew , is that we must pretend to be quite incapable of grasping the self-evident . " His mother smiled to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception to that . What a pity . " Puttingdown her hairbrush she began to look at her eyebrowsin a magnifying mirror . " I 'm sorry you had a dull tea and I 'm sorry you and Cousin Katharine do n't like Dr. Codman . I , for one , wish she 'd marry him . He 's a very good doctor . " " Marry Dr. Codman ? " His voice was a squeal . The pigeon moaned again like something sick . " Dr. Codman or anyone ! " exclaimed his mother . " Anyone at all ! It has gone on too long . Her solitude has gone on far too long and year after year she has grown . . . she has grown more unpredictable . " He was indignant at the thought of Dr. Codman eatingthe pears at Congreve House with that blue tooth and running his hand over Minerva 's helmet as he had fondled Shakespeare 's beard , and he said , " If she does marry him , you can bet your boots I 'll never go back to Hawthorne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a familyof her own then . " The possibility of never going back to Congreve House , of being supplanted by another boy ( first of all it would be a baby and he loathed babies ) so depressed him that he closed his eyes and behind them he saw small pictures of things he might very well not seep205again ; the fruit room behind the kitchen where Mrs. Shea kept her jars of tomato preserves and grape catsupand chowchow , a room with a country coolness and a country smell where , on hot days , Beth lay at full length as limp and insensible as if she had been killed . Ile saw the lake and the river and the pond and the marriage elms ; he smelled an early apple , freckled with pink , that he had picked up from the deep grass . Suddenly he said , " She wo n't marry him , I promise you . He 's a hootnanny and she knows it . " " What is he ? A hoot what ? " There was a rapid double knock on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him the chill of the street and , so Andrew thought , an echo of the smell of the room on Brimmer Street , of Cousin Katharine 's unique perfume and Dr. Codman 's roses and the fire on the hearth . He nodded to his son and to his wife he said , " Your match-making was a fiasco . She has sent Codman away with a flea in his ear . " Mrs. Shipley put her forefingers to her temples and closed her eyes and murmured , " It is n't natural . " " It is n't your business whether it 's natural or not , " her husband said brusquely . " If she marries , she 'll marry . " " We should n't be talking this way before Andrew . " Andrew picked up his school bag and started for the door . " I 'm not a child , " he said . " Why did you say all that about the guest house when you were really there to make her get married ? " His father straightened up and looked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winked though Andrew was in no mood to accept such an intimacy . " I was killing two birds with one stone , " he said , " catching two cods with one line . " He laughed at his joke , but Andrew did not . He went on , " Sorry , old man , about that thingamajig you were going to look at . A frog 's gall bladder , was it ? " Andrew clenched his fists and enunciating clearly , he said , " Botany is the study of plants . If frogs have gall bladders , which I doubt , you would look at them in zoology . " " They were going to look at tap water , " said his mother . " Jove ! " said his father . When he had closed the door , he outlined on it a skull and crossbones with his finger and for a moment he listened at the keyhole . His mother said , " What is it ? Oh God , John , tell me what it is ! " And his father answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing more than the inevitable changes that are taking place in you . And in me . Nothing to get stirred up about . " And in a lighter voice he continued , " I meant to call you earlier but I got jammed up . I sha n't be going to the Websters ' tonight . My potentate from Indiana wants to see the sights . " A silence followed and Andrew went upstairs , listening briefly at Harriet 's door , but she was only con-j ugating fero , ferre , tali , latum . That story about the guest house had been a whopper . The only thing that had been built at Congrevep207House this summer was Adam 's doll house for his harelipped niece . They were so flat and limp , both of them , and reconstructingthat dispiriting scene , Andrew decided that while he wished Cousin Katharine were his mother , he wished someone altogether different were his father , someone he did not know , and he wondered what the drowned Mr. Smithwick had been like . If Cousin Katharinehad married him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have been his brother ? Now he was rattled and he pushed aside these philosophicalexperiments and gazed around the room , looking for something to do . It was an excludingly feminine room . The painted furniture was French , thin-legged and daintily furbelowed ; in the recesses of the windows there were two round tables on one of which stood a figure of Minerva , on the other , Venus . On the pearl-white walls , there hung six likenesses of Cousin Katharine , by six different painters ; as a shepherdess , as a horsewoman , as a bird lover , a debutante , a bibliophile , as Marie Antoinette dressed for a masked ball . On the desk that had once been a spinet , there was a double inkwell made of Sevres and silver and there was a mountainous supply of letterpaper for her huge , incessant correspondence . Here was her black record of birds and here was her big diary . And here , as in the drawing room , there were the testimonialsof her restlessness : another easel , smaller than the one downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low table over which spilled from thep208wide maw of her knitting bag the brilliant yarns of half a dozen unfinished sweaters . Her place in Don Quixote was marked with a letter from the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin , addressed in his father 's hand . He would have liked to read the letter , he would have liked even better to read her diary and he touched its plump covers and lifted it up to judge its weight . He took the two thin , closely written sheets of paper out of the envelope with its Irish stamp , but as he hesitated , he saw the cat out of the corner of his eye stand up in her basket and look at him alertly . His bad conscience made him shudder as it had done earlier when he had seen Maddox 's face at the window and returning the letter to its place and putting the lemon-drop box neatly on the diary so that it was encircled by the signs of the zodiac embossed in gold , he left the room , feeling the vigilant cat 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to peter out , but it was still too sopping wet to go outdoors and the house was still dark and he felt like someone going crazy in a dungeon . He must keep busy or he might begin to scream , so he went up to the big attic that ran the length of the ell and resumed his examination of other people 's property . A smell of squirrels and dust came from the old beams and hornets seethed sleepily in the rafters . His footsteps made the floorboards snap and a mouse sped through the maze of rounded trunks and wicker hampers , patched with the stickers , like heraldic emblems , of the half-mythical hotels of Florence , Athens , and Madrid.  |p209Often  in the past on just such stormy days as this , he had come up here with Honor and Harriet and had dressed up in the clothes left behind by people who had died or had left them to moulder because they were no longer in vogue . Against a trunk that had belonged to Great-Uncle George leaned a pair of snowshoes that probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumsily over the floor and rousing every small beast in the attic . Then he opened his uncle 's trunk from which arose a smell of camphor balls and wool ; under the withering tissue paper lay morning coats and dinner jackets and opera capes . Uncle George had been very particular about his clothes and he had gone annually to London to confer with his tailor for three weeks . Miss Duff said of him , " Best-dressed man on God 's green earth . " All the fabrics were old and soft to the touch ; Andrew stroked a dark red smoking jacket with velvet lapels and heavily embroidered frogs . He took out a pair of white trousers and a blazer with broad blue stripes , a crimson foulard ascot and a canvas yachting cap and when he had put them on over his own clothes ( he was swallowed up and he giggled idiotically to think how he must look ) he began to look for a top or a pair of Indian clubs or something , anything , to distracthim for the rest of the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once have belongedon the Empress Katharine and a box of lotto cards and a parchesi game . And then he did find a top in a carton that contained wooden curtain rings and the ends of birthday candles . It was a bright red one andp210when he spun it , it seemed to have a glad life of its own ; it was bursting with energy and merriment and he hated to see it slow and begin to falter and finally to keel over and become again nothing but a shape in wood . He spun it over and over , endowing it with vitality , making it a being more substantial than his twin . Andrew was in the entrance hall spinning the top when the ladies of the house came back . He saw them through the sidelights , his smiling sisters flanking his cousin who wore a white leghorn hat , tied down with an old-fashioned motoring veil ; he slipped behind the bamboo screen , meaning to give them the surprise of their lives . But the top , unfortunately , was still spinningwhen Honor opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slits of the wood , glance round , a little startled , " Fee , fie , fo , fum , " she said . " I smell the blood of an Englishman . " He waited , breathing shallowly . " Ignore the Englishman , " said Harriet and went into the library to put down her packages . " The Englishmanhas knocked over the trinity of Congreve House , " she called out . The top slowed , reeled and fell , the play gone out of it . " Harriet ! " cried Honor . " We 'd better go see if the Englishman has been in our rooms . Did you take the key to your Line-a-Day ? " And the two girls ran laughingup the stairs . He knew that in a moment when Honor found what he had written below her forecastp211of her love affair with James Partridge , rage would replaceher lightheartedness and the infantile frolic would be over . So he stepped out of hiding to have , at least , the pleasure of fooling Cousin Katharine . She had her back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , but she wheeled instantly when he said , " The Empress Katharine , I presume ? " She seemed , she really did , not to know who he was . She stared into the dusky depths of the hall and the letters fell right out of her hand and lay at her feet in a perfect fan . She was taken in to such an extent that she said " John ? " and could not move . It was the most successfulhoax he had ever perpetrated . Honor ruined it as he had known she would do , flying downstairs in a tantrum , spluttering unintelligibly but doing it at the top of her voice . And then , to his astonishment , he saw that Cousin Katharine was angry with him too ; she looked at him frigidly , freezing him solid , and without a word she turned and went upstairs . Skinned and smarting , at the dizzy peak of his restivenessand loneliness , he shouted at her retreating figure , " I hate you ! I hate you all ! " and savagely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his raving sister , " You shut up or I 'll kill you ! "  |p212BECAUSE  HER HANDS shook so , ostentatiously publishingto her mirror the dishevelment of her nerves , Katharinecould not undo that knot of her veil and as if this failure were a catastrophe , she sank to the floor beside a window , still hatted , and tightly locked her fingers to stop their fidgets and tried , and failed , to cry . Even in extremity , she could not seduce a single tear from her eyes . She had misplaced her rose-colored glasses which until now had taken the place of the gift of tears , and because she was herself bedeviled without them , she saw in everyone the symptoms of decay . Andrew , masquerading clownishly in her father 's clothes , looming out of the palpitant light , had seemed instinct with crime , with an active immorality that transliteratedhis travesty into a threat . She had felt preyedp213upon . This time it had been necessary , such was the increasing delicacy of her inner balance , to show him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was angry with him . Just as she had been obliged , out of self-preservation , to berate him when his eye had fallen on Mangareva , so just now she had had to throw up a smoke screen of adult displeasure to conceal her staggered utterance of his father 's name . It sickened her that she had cried it out but even more she was sickenedby his tempestuous cry that he hated her . In the course of the punishment that must follow , and in his remorse , it was possible that he would forget her aberrationand remember only his own misdeed . But it was equally possible that he would not forget . One knew as much at twelve as one was ever goingto know . Even more perhaps , since at that age one wasstill , philosophically if not practically , in a state ofnature and could cleave through the toughest tissues tothe heart of the matter . Certainly she had known , known even before she was twelve , how rickety wasthe scaffolding of her parents ' marriage ; she had proceededfrom just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew a little while ago , to the knowledge that her father had a mistress . It had been throughsome process infinitely more direct than logic , somethinginstantaneous and unquestionable , that she hadperceived that the reason her father had often seemedto prefer Maeve was that Maeve was not the daughter of his wife whom he did not love . Later , when he grewp214accustomed to his guilt , he had begun to lavish on Katharinethe fruits of his cool heart . She remembered how in the beginning at school in France , when both she and her cousin were languid with homesickness , her greatest joy had lain in her letters from him in which he sent impersonal messages to Maeve ; even though Maeve wrote to him every day and every day , finding no envelope addressed to herself , burst into tears . She was reluctant to admit it to herself , but she was afraid that she had never really forgiven Maeve for those two or three years when she had been her father 's darling . The fact was that she had never really forgiven poor Maeve for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her will and her intelligence , she had tried to love Maeve and , failing , had come at last to this ultimate betrayal . In Katharine , a grown and apparently integratedwoman , there bitterly rankled still the recollectionsof how all the young men in her girlhood had been taken first with her and every one of them had abandoned her the moment they met Maeve , who was not more beautiful , not more alert , danced no better . This imponderable in Maeve , even now , Katharine could not define , but clearly it had been there , immediately recognizable to men and immediately alluring . She recalled that once the two of them had fallen in love with a German who lived there in the French town , and they quivered at the sight of his great height and his blond head , in the streets and the shops when they were allowed to leave the school to make small pur/chases and to drink chocolate in an approved cafe . One day they had separated and Katharine had gone alone to the stationer 's shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolscap and had heard the shopkeeper address him as " M. Faust . " She had stood beside him at the counter , so agitated that her French left her , so giddy that she pointed to ink when she had come for envelopes . He had smelled richly of tobacco and pomade and out of courtesy to her , he had taken off his cap , showing a sculptured , intellectual forehead . When she left , he held the door open for her and she said boldly , " Vielen dank , Meinherr , " and had been transportedwhen he smiled and bowed and paid her babyGermana compliment , " Gut gesprechen , gnadiges Fraulein . " She had kept the secret of his name from Maeve and yet , on the very next excursion to town , they had met Herr Faust in the road and Maeve had greeted him , calling him by name . Katharine asked her how she had come to know it and Maeve had replied , with her disarming candour , " He told it to me . He 's a novelist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been feverish with jealousy . Afterward , a three-cornered friendship had sprung up and they had had meetings in teashops that the girls were forbidden to enter and had taken walks together in the woods , though this was not allowed . Though the young man had listened gravely to Katharine'sobservations on literature ( she had begun , as soon as she had learned his name , to read Goethe ) his eyes were forever on Maeve . It was Maeve 's elbowp216that was cupped when they came to a log fallen across the path , it was Maeve who was asked if she were cold , it was Maeve who was invited first to choose her pastry . But Katharine had persevered ; she would be noticed and , seeking to flatter him by imitating him , she began to write a novel . When she had finished twenty pages of it ( it had dealt with a nun who had broken her vows ) she had submitted it to Herr Faust to read , and at their next meeting , returning the manuscript to her , he had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or paint ringaround-a-rosyon saucers , " and to Maeve , not to her , he had explained why women should never try to write . His heavy , arrogant , Teutonic waggishness had been unendurable . As soon as they got back to the school , Katharine had written to her mother that a certain man of the town had succeeded in converting Maeve to anarchy , a yarn that could not fail to arouse the lawabidingAlma Congreve . Until some weeks later , when Sister Chrysostom had a letter from her and both girls were reprimanded for breaking rules and their permission to leave the convent grounds was suspended , Katharine had had to put up with several more meetings with the man during which he teased her about the novel which had been called " The Bright Blight . " Down the years of girlhood , she had suffered these small fractures of the heart while Maeve , infrangible and unbruised , had never been aware in her tranquillity that anything was wrong . She felt , these days , that she was living in a void and that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift trip to chaos , changing the climatefrom despair to dementia . For in the evening after Edmund St. Denis had witlessly held up her relationship with John to such maudlin ridicule , after she had been attended by the little doctor and her frightened maids and finally had been left alone , she had written a letter to the Shipleys in which , embedded in gossip and bulletins on the welfare and occupationsof the children , she had told John that the daydream , for her , was finished . Last winter I flirted with the notion of pulling up my stakes and leaving everything behind she wrote , thought of going to live in Bermuda , perhaps , that blessed isle where the internal combustionmachine does not intrude . If you can believe it of me , I thought of selling Congreve House or turning it over to the state for some good antiquariancause . What possessed me , I can not think , unless it was that usual slump that everyone falls into in February  --  I seem to recall that both of you were very low about that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come so fully to my senses that I intend to have my gravestone made in Thomas by the man who made Minerva and Papa 's stone and when it 's finished , to have it stored in the stable , until the solemn day when it is laid on top of me . It is a kind of insurance  --  however tenuous and symbolic  --  against my suddenly kicking over the traces and going off to a flamboyant island in my middle age . The stone will be superb , if Mr. Normanexecutes it as I plan . My neighbors havep218formed two opposing camps , one horrified , the other benedictory , and if I have done no other act of generosity , I have provided Hawthorne with a meaty subject of discussion . Maeve 's reply had been , as she had expected , filled with anxious questions and it was evident , despite the shrouding tact , that she thought Katharine was either gravely ill or mildly mad . She suggested that they come home earlier this year than usual and she proposed that if the children were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a postscript she added , " Our difficulties , John 's and mine , do not diminish . How on earth is it going to end ? " She had expected from John a storm of anger and had , to tell the truth , looked forward to it , had in her mind written back with equal indignation , sending the letter to the business address at which he had told her to write him . There had come instead a groaning petitionthat she reconsider , a plea to know if he had offendedher in any way and it had ended , " You must ask yourself this question : Have you the moral right to destroy me ? If you are thinking of Maeve or of the children , you are being ungenerous to everyone , for the divorce is a foregone conclusion . My life is in your hands . " But Katharine was certain that he would not divorce Maeve ; he would not , that is , unless another woman appeared with her hands outstretched , delighted to take his life in them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after half a year or perhaps a year , thep219talk would die down ( like Maeve , the gossips imagined that he kept a dancer ) and his " bit of a fling " would be forgiven and even condoned as something perfectly naturalin the life of any healthy , good-looking man of forty-two . And he himself , looking back , would probablythink , " That was a narrow squeak . " Eventually he would even be able to console himself for his want of accomplishment by imagining that he had sacrificed his career to his family and he could die praiseworthy in his own eyes . But none of this would he foresee now . One time she had told him that if he botched this loop-the-loop , he would hate her with far more passion than he loved her now and he had chucked her under the chin ( it was hard for her to believe , just as it had been hard to believeat the moment it happened ) and had said , " There will be no botching . This is n't puppy-love , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exactly what it was , but how convey that to him ? How tell him : what I wanted I have now achieved , my desire is consummated for I have supplanted Maeve , and we would have to be born again and to live our lives up to the night of the Catherinewheels for me to pull up from my earth my intricate , tenacious roots . She had continued to write to the two of them and had not written privately to him , and knowing what pain it must cause him , had told them of the ball she meant to have , strewing the many creamy sheets of her letter with reminiscences of their first meeting ( " It was I , the bystander , that knew the two of you were done for , notp220you the actors in that pretty pastoral play . ' The jig is up , ' said I , looking at you , for you had n't a ghost of a chance of getting your hearts back once you 'd lost them to each other " ) and knowing how these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell himself , as Edmund did , that until a man is forty he does n't know where he is at . But she wrote with her blood , for all the while that she repudiated John Shipley as he was now , she was hungry to avidity for him as he had been then , as he might have been , as he had been this very afternoon , stepping softly around the wing of the bamboo screen . A rainbow arched across the western sky , its nearer terminus behind the canting chimney of the Smithwick house and its yonder one lost in the trees that fringed the headtide . The stone curls of the Roman notables stationed along the boundaries of the rosary were roguishly plastered with leaves from the plane trees above . And the birds that had been driven to shelter in the storm were out again , singing in the arbors , undoubtedlynettling Maddox with their cheer since he , for days now , would be cheered by nothing , now that his belles had been decapitated and their tattered petals lay in the mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns . Katharine could see him pacing the sticky paths of the garden , his hands slack at his sides , his head disconsolately hanging forward as he surveyed his slaughtered virgins . She sometimes felt that Maddox carried his personifications too far and one time she had been disturbed when , after a heavy wind , he had had ap221mass burial of the ravaged blossoms ( some of them stabbed by their own thorns ) , interring the sodden , fragrantmass in a shallow grave beside the summerhouse . She had not found the ceremony sentimental  --  as her friends , on hearing of it , did : " Pathetic fallacy it 's called , if I 'm not mistaken , " Peg Duff had said  --  but nearly psychopathic . Thinking back on it , she was reminded of a lemon tree she had seen today , growing in a solarium of the state prison ; it had produced one fruit , still green but of titanic size , and its custodian , a short and hunchbackedparricide , referred to the tree as " he " and the lemon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fertilized this boy with vetch . " A foul effluvium had come from a stone crock of fertilizer ; the whole scene had been one of hatred and scurrility and when she turned to go , the man had said , with sarcastic piety , " I took a life so now I make a life . You know the old saying , A lemon a day keeps the hangman away , ' " and he had tittered shrilly , squeezing his eyes between dirty wrinkles , showing huge false teeth . She had no affinity for homespun wisdom but , even so , she was repelled by this perversion of it and so had pretended not to hear ( Honor and Harriet laughed and one of them said , " Jimmy will love that ! " ) and had gone to examine a rack of trays on which were painted teapots , windmills and love birds . An incident like this was in itself too trivial to be more than noted in passing and at another time in her life , Katharine Congreve , who believed in sweetness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to remember it ; if the memory had gained access in spitep222of her , she would certainly never have drawn a parallel between the convict in his vengeful act of penance and her gardener , an honest man whose idee fixe , though it was often difficult to live with , implied no unseemly motive . But " at another time in her life " she had not yet opened up Pandora 's box . The boy must get his dressing down . She stroked the cat and touched the squirming kittens and steeled herself to call to Andrew and to deliver to him a lecture on the misuse of the word " hate . " But as she started across the room , it struck her that there was something wrong at her desk and she stood for a moment looking down at it . Nothing was missing , nothing was in disarray . It was several minutes before she realized that the box she kept lemon drops in had been set squarely on her diary . She remembered that she had left it in the small guest room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary had begun to turn the room out ( there were to be several overnight guests on the occasion of the ball ) . She had been carrying a vase of roses that she meant to put in the hall window and now she remembered that she had forgotten them , too , having been called to the telephone in the middle of her inspection . She had gone through the drawers to make sure that there was nothing in them to distract ( or interest ) a visitor and in the desk she had found a photograph of herself and Maeve . It was innocuous enough except for the inscription on the back which had been childishly unkind , bearing in it a reference to a skin disorder of Maeve 's which Kathar/ine had prayed would be incurable : actually had prayed , with humble Christian words and phrases , in the Lady Chapel at Chartres while , impatient in the aisle beside her , a subaltern of the sacristan had waited , sniffling and shuffling , to guide her and Maeve up the tower , the profanity of his avarice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heaven . How that day , as all shameful days , came back ! When they had emerged from the murk of the cold , weird winding stairs onto the lowest of the church 's roofs and had leaned over the parapet looking down upon the distant little houses and the puffs of budding April trees , her muscles had tightened against the desire to fling herself off and in her desperate fear of the height , which she had never experienced before , she had been frantic , certain that she could neither go farther up nor go back down the ' precipitous and slippery stairs . And yet , the moment she had seen this same terror in Maeve whose breath came spastically , who clutched the solid stone for dear life and tottered when she closed her eyes to the chasm of the narrow street below , Katharine , through an act of will , regained her equilibrium , unmercifully laughed at her cousin who , really sick with fright , began to cry . She had gone on with the guide , as far up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun . When they came back , she had not moved but her rigidity was gone and she quivered and her teeth chattered as if she had a chill . The swindling little Frenchman had been , if anything , more blatant in his taunts than Katharine ; their conspiring giggles , on the slow trip down , hadp224echoed in the malign twilight . The chaperone , waiting for them in the vestibule , having admitted freely to her own phobia for heights , had hectored Maeve with smellingsalts though by this time she had fully recovered and wished only that her cowardice ( for that was what Katharine and the batrachian cicerone had called it ) be forgotten . No one , she told herself rationally , could possibly read all of that into the casual photograph of schoolgirls on an educational tour . But , all the same , she felt invaded , for her desk was known as sacrosanct and no servant ever touched it , even to the extent of civilly putting on it something , like this box , that she had misplaced . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would also have put the roses where they belonged and the table in the hall window , as she could see through her open door , was bare . So it must have been Andrew , alone in the house , idle and restless in the rain . What had he made of the inscription ? And what else had he done ? She turned to last night 's entry in her diary and read : The boy 's somnambulism has passed but his nightmarescontinue . He screamed in his sleep just before dawn this morning and when I went in to rescue him from his ogre , I found him already resting easily again and looking , in the half-light , so like John that I was too much drawn to him to touch him although the covering had fallen off and the wind was cool . I mean that I had no idea what form my gesture would take , for he has become the vor/tex of these chimeral fancies that seek to undermineme and while I struggle to resurrect the past by any rapacious reading of his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face that in my own nightmaresis omnipresently before me . Himself again in linen trousers and a striped blue shirt , Andrew sat on the hassock at the foot of the chaise longue , the picture of contrition , his feet in sneakers pointing , pigeon-toed , at the tail of a golden dragon in the rug , his hands clasping and unclasping as he admitted that he had done everything he was accused of for no good reason except that he had had nothing else to do since he could not find any mucilage to go on putting together the facade of the State House , and had therefore occupied himself with whatever had come to hand . For no good reason , he had put the photograph of his parents and his cousin face downward and he deniedhis sisters ' charge that this had been an act of disrespectto his elders ; but he was sorry . And he had written on a piece of paper that Honor was a moron but if Cousin Katharine could see what she had written on it in the first place ( he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would agree with him ; for this , too , he was sorry . Sighing , he went on with his list of misdemeanours : he had dressed up in Uncle George 's boatingp226clothes and was sorry for it , and had frightened her and was sorry and was sorry , above all , for having said what he did for it was not true , he did not hate them all . And he was sorry . . . but he stopped and lowered his head . In the quiet the clock 's ticks crashed . " Maddox says it will take more than him and Adam to set off the fireworks , " Andrew said suddenly , invalidatinghis remorse with his exuberance and the smile that smoothed out the scowl on his forehead . " So can I help ? " " We 'll talk about that later , but now I want to know what else you did this afternoon . Did you read your sisters ' diaries ? " " They were locked , " he said and lowered his head again . " Then what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all afternoon to turn over the picture and to write on Honor 's slip of paper . I 'm not really prying . I only want to know how you spent the afternoon . " She tried to trap him with a friendly smile . " Oh , you know ! I walked around and looked at things . I hunted for that top . I thought . " He would admit no more ; he could not or he would not say why it was that today , of all days , he had been urged to dress up in anachronistic clothes to match herselfand he seemed wholly innocent when , shooting off at a tangent , he asked , " Honestly and truly , did you think I was Daddy ? Just for a minute maybe ? " and his disappointment seemed genuine when she told him that after her first surprise she had only played his game ;  |p227she  had had to appear angry with him , she quickly explained , in order not to seem to be playing favorites in Honor 's eyes : it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had although , the Lord knew , she said , that one could stoop to almost anything on a confining afternoonlike this . She paused , waiting for his confession that he had stooped to something base , but he said nothing and tired at last of the interrogation which proceeded nowhere , she dismissed him , telling him that for having said he hated everyone , he must not speak until after dinner . His jaw set stubbornly as he turned to go ; facingthe door , he said , " I do n't hate you , but there are some people that I do . " " You must n't be vehement . You do n't hate anyone . " " Oh , but I do ! There are certain people that I hate so much I wish they 'd die . But I do n't hate you . " He wheeled around again and said , " When is the tombstone coming ? " " Why ? Why do you want to know ? " she cried . " I 'll tell you why ! Because I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He stood with his fists clenched over his head , the tip of his tongue showing slyly at the corner of his mouth , his eyes rolled upward . In her alarm at this dreadful transformation , she looked away and heard him run from the room and scramble down the stairs , heard the front door open and bang loudly to and heard the maniacal child scream at the top of his voice , " I 'll talk to myself if I want to ! I can talk to the trees and the snakes and the road and the houses ! " She saw him running down toward the lake ,  |p228calling  out his own name , " Andrew ! Andrew Shipley ! " and she turned weakly to her desk . She remembered having read once , in a scornful , misanthropicbook that the degeneration of a society was often marked by " graphomania " when verbiage streamed from the pens of the decadent and doomed . And from that she went on to think of a friend who had gone into a nervous collapse after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to everyone she knew , covering page after page with unrelated matter , quotationsfrom poetry , diatribes against the nurses in her sanitarium , minutely described accounts of meals and quarrels ; sometimes , in the middle of a paragraph she worked out a problem in algebra . The tragedy of the letters had been that here and there in the tenebrous purgatory of them , there had been light glades of sanity and Katharine thought now of the woman 's picture of the institution 's dining room , " It has a hush like Sunday and there is nothing to look at except our food and a fire extinguisher that hangs beside the door . I am too near-sighted to read the words on it from where I sit and so , instead , I count the little humps in the plaster that run like a frieze around the window near my chair , but I never remember from meal to meal how many there are . My life is so reduced now to the bare necessitiesthat I do not know what will become of me if I ever do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that if this happened , I might induce them to let me change my place so that I could read the words on the fire extinguisher . " The irony had then caved inp229and the rest of the long letter was a wandering babble . In six weeks , Katharine 's loose-leaf diary had doubled in size . She had written more in this time than she had written in the sixteen years before , since this had been her only possible confessional and she had hoped , through the articulation of her fears , to quiet them and right herself . Heretofore , it had been her custom to make one daily entry after lunch , usually as impersonal as notations in a ship 's log , but now , like the corrupt graphomaniacs , she wrote in it at all hours of the day and in the dead of night when she could not sleep , drawingher shutters and her curtains so that her light would not be seen by her cordial , inquisitive neighbors . Harassed by the whippoorwills , she would at last get up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivory earstopples . She seldom read over what she had written but she knew , without reviewing them , that these nocturnal outpourings , exaggerated as they were bound to be by the intensification of her loneliness in the dark and the silence , wholly revealed her . She should destroy the book , she thought , although , if the boy had read it , the damage was already done . ( But he had said I do not hate you and he could not have said those words if he had read these words , " Is it not a sin crying to heaven for vengeance to be sometimes in love with a child and at other times , terrified of exposure , to wish him off the face of the earth ? " ) At times , the countless elements of her double life ( it was more than double ; it was a labyrinth of paths that turned back on themselves , crossing and recrossing )  |p230were  as clear to her as a table of contents , and at those times the issues assumed their due proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John to burn his ; she had returned from the only aberration of her life . But there were other times  --  and these were either in the night or when she was surprised by some fresh problem or snatched by some old misery  --  when she was consumed by the smallest of vexations . One night , not long ago , she had not been able to turn her thoughts away from an absurd argument she had had with Brantley Wainright-Lowe on the subject of Cezanne . He , who " dabbled " in water colors and made dithyrambic studies of her swans and peacocks , had patronizingly patted her hand ( his tactile need enraged her ; he was forever touching her shoulder or her wrist as if without this physical accompaniment he could not speak ) , and had said of Cezanne , " There is a kind of simplicity about him that is rather charming , I admit , but he is really no great shakes . Of course I can understand how people who are in no way artistic would look on things differently from myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had been beset by a hurricane of anger , no less turbulent than if the cause had been John or Maeve . Again , she had paced and fretted one whole night through over Maureen who , stupidly , was pregnantand who , trusting and devoted and naive , had put upon her mistress 's shoulders the responsibility of solvingher dilemma . Her sleep could be extorted from her by word from her caretaker in Boston that a leak in the dining roomp231had mildewed the wallpaper ; or by the image of EdmundSt . Denis at a picnic as he lay , rowdily spreadeagledon the sand in an unbecoming bathing suit , trying to catch her eye with a pleading , hangdog expression or to catch her ear with a cajoling whisper . Or she could spend the night calling off the roll of the men who had been in love with her as , in gentle lamplight , she gazed at herself in the mirror , drowning in her beauty ; stripped of every amenity , enthroned upon her invincible selflove , she would fall forward on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty dissolved and weep and weep and weep and with her wet lips pressed to the back of her hand , murmur , " They did not . Only the Humanist loved me . " She knew that it was only a question of time before the signature of her distress would be written on her face . The sleeplessness would show , staining the eyesockets , loosening the flesh from the cheekbones , and the headacheswould assert themselves in lines , and the dragging weakness in her arms as if all the strata of her flesh were starving except the live , thrashing nerves . Tired to death , she could not stop the continuum of woundedand-wounding , or of **25;6615;TOOLONG ( it could go on forever ; if Maeve 's parents had lived and Maeve had not , therefore , started it all by winning Katharine 's father for those few but most important years , making it necessary from that time on for Katharine to compete with her ; if Katharine 's father 's father had told him how to treat a daughter in that crucial situation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onep232came to Adam and the blame was spread out evenly upon the human race ) and she could not remember when life had been anything but this , when it had been possible to enjoy , to look forward to , to want to own something or to meet someone . Now she could only take on blind faith the promise her reason made her , that there had to be an end to this sickness that alternated between coma and paroxysm , and that when that time came , her whole life might swing into a different course . She was not sure , she made no plans , but it occurred to her that perhaps she would no longer immolate herself to the distant August night . She , who had been constant , might change , but into what and through what means she could not yet imagine . Her forefinger outlined the body of the gilded fish embossed on the red cover of her diary and a ceremoniousplan came to mind ; after the ball was over , she would assist herself in her release by burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreckage . " After the ball was over . " The tune of the song began to play and , afraid that it , like other minutiae , would go on and on like a stuck phonograph , she forcibly expelled it and turned level-headedly to making a furtherplan whereby to conceal her malady from everyone , for , above all , despite her outward eccentricities , she was conventional , and she did not want to have her melancholyanatomized by women at lunch and men in their clubs . The children would stay , as always , until September and she , as always , would linger on as a denizen ofp233Hawthorne until election day . And only then would she close Congreve House . ( How hard it was to leave the country in the autumn ! When the leaves had turned , flaring in the steady sun , releasing their metallic leaves to the winds that riffled over the aging grass and the dying gardens . Dogs came to play in the dunes of fallen leaves and the geese came over across the faultless sky ; in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watched by the red foxes from their lairs in the meadow . The town began to close in on itself , snuggling its houses with banking boards and storm windows . The big summerhouses were bleak and out of place and the summer gentry , no longer having the upper hand , began to leave in something like embarrassment . One thing was not gone from her , she thought as she thought of the autumn , and that was her abiding love of her dominion and all the natural enchantments that surrounded it . ) So , she would close Congreve House and would go back to Boston and after she had seen John once , she thought she would go away , perhaps to make a retreat at some Roman Catholic convent of a silent order , not to pray , but simply , for a time , to drop appearances . In time , all would be well . And if the boy already knew , there was no helping it . To every child there must come some wretched , sordid foreknowledge of what it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ( his statement that he did not could have been devious and deep ) and hated his father ( he was bound , finally , to hate him anyhow , for John was indifferent to his children and had only a vestigial memory of what it had been like to bep234a boy ) and if his whole life was tinged by his secret knowledge  --  secret , for he could never admit to his sistersor his parents that he had read a private diary , this being , thank God , in their mores , an inadmissible and heinous crime  --  she would not take all the blame . " Andrew ! Andrew Shipley ! " Now he was running back to the house and now down the length of the lawn . At the hammock , some sound or sight arrested him . The marine light of late afternoon after a rain , and the angle from which she regarded him , enlarged him and looking as tall as a man , as she watched , he clasped his hands over the back of his long neck . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from the window , and from the foot of the lawn he mocked her , calling , " Honor ! Honor ! Your enemy is here . "  |p235ADAM  AND MADDOX AND ANDREW stood in the barn looking down at Katharine Congreve 's tombstone that had come early that morning from Thomas by truck . It had taken five men , huffing and puffing and swearing , to get it into the barn . One of them had called the stone a bitch and another had called it a bastard and when they rested they marveled , using the same kind of language , at anyone who would anticipate death to such an extent in so calm a way . One of them had tapped his forehead and said , " Low tide , if you ask my , opinion . " The stonecutter , Mr. Norman , an unprepossessing little old man in rimless spectacles and a square mustache , had sat on the terrace with Cousin Katharine watching the proceedings and drinking coffee with her as he accepted her compliments , bashfully denying them.  |p236He  wore gray suede gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matched his new fedora ; with his sober black suit and his old-fashioned high stiff collar and his broad black tie , he looked like a pallbearer or an undertaker and he did nothing to dispel the illusion by his conversation . At one point he said , " If you know of anyone else who contemplates this move , would you be so kind as to put in a word on my behalf ? Tombstones are my forte . " Honor had burst into laughter and apologizedimmediately but said that the phrase " contemplate this move " had been the funniest thing she had ever heard and Mr. Norman , profoundly gratified , beamed at her , shuffled his spatted feet and allowed , " My wife tells me that I turn a neat phrase every once in a while . " It was hard to associate his masterpiece with Mr. Normanand his finicking ways ( his little finger had stood out at a right angle when he picked up his coffee cup and he had pursed his lips into a rosebud before each speech ) and the coachman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's abilities by his appearance . For the stone was as impressive as the statue of Minerva and the figure of Cousin Katharine , in marble effigy , was as heroic and as handsome . It was a likeness awesomely accurate , though Mr. Norman had made only one sketch of her on the day she came to place her order . It showed , in the piebald stone , her protuberant pompadourarising from her wide forehead and her noble nose and chin and her broad , loving lips , but it showed , even more wonderfully , her pure and vestal air ; the actual person seemed to lie beneath the folds of her full sleevesp237and her long skirt . Between her peaceful hands she held a full-blown rose and over her head there was an intricatelycarved circle ; seven hooked spikes curved inward from the rim pointing toward the name engraved there and the date of her birth and the empty space below that would be filled in when she died . " Katharine Congreve , born August 3o , 1898 , " read Adam . " Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it out to be ? " But Maddox was examining the rose ; his stained , heavy fingers palpitated over the petals and he smiled , glorying in the cleverness of the stonecutter . " That 's an awful wonderful thing , " he said . " Could be a rowel , " said Adam , still looking at the design at the top , " except the teeth go in , not out . Is it some kind of a family dohicus , Mr. Andrew , some kind of a coat of arms ? " " It 's a Catherine wheel , " said Miss Congreve from the doorway . She had brought out the maids to view the stone and they stood timidly in the sunlight , hangingback , not wanting to look at all but forcing themselves to express an admiration they did not feel . " A Catherine wheel ! " exclaimed Andrew . She did take the cake , as Adam had said earlier . A Fourth of July thing carved on her gravestone ! Why not a Christmaswreath with bells on it or an Easter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somewhat to his disappointment , from Mrs. Shea who was a fount of knowledgeon matters ecclesiastical , that this was the symbol of the martyr Catherine . " They tied her to a thing likep238that and set it spinning , but it broke before it killed her and then they chopped off her head . " The little maids were even more distressed and Maureen seemed about to cry and furtively she crossed herself while the cook went on to expatiate on *St . Catherine 's intrepid character . The men were puzzled but they said nothing ; it was all over their heads as it was over Andrew 's . By now there was a huddle of spectators in the doorway , for Miss Duff , who had seen the truck drive up , had spread the word around and all of Cousin Katharine'sfriends had dropped what they were doing and had come straight to Congreve House in order to be among the first to see what Brantley Wainright-Lowe called " Katy 's hick-jacket . " Unlike the servants , all of them at the sight of the memento @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praised the workmanship ( " an estimable performance ! " said Mr. Barker and clapped his hands ) and the way Mr. Norman had uncannily caught Katharine 's singular look ( " Damfino , " said Miss Duff and slapped her jodhpurs with her riding whip , " the very spit of you " ) , they all agreed with old Miss Heminway that " our Katharine " was a humourist . Miss Duff and Mrs. Tyler were as gay as the others but Andrew saw them exchange a wink . " What 's that thing there ? " said Mrs. WainrightLowe , pointing to the Catherine wheel with the handle of her butterfly net , and after Cousin Katharine had explained , in the absence of the expert , Mrs. Shea , who had returned to the house and her baking , the grass widow , whose cross she was fond of telling friends wasp239heavier than most , chided , " Oh , now , Katharine , that 's too far-fetched for words . Whoever in the world scourged you ? " " Whips tipped with metal , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole of Miss Duff 's mind was seldom in attendance when there was a gathering of more than three . " Far-fetched or not , " said Mr. Barker defensively , " I call it a crackerjack idea . Her name 's Katharine , is n't it ? " Mrs. Wainright-Lowe wagged her finger at him , made sure that the maids had gone and said , " You 're going into your dotage , Rodney , if you imagine that Alma and George Congreve would ever have named her for a Popish person . " There was some discussion then over whether or not Catherine of Alexandria was included in the hierarchy of the Anglo-Catholic saints and Mrs. Wainright-Lowe , the only Presbyterian that Mrs. Tyler admitted knowingsocially , was ignored . Seeking then to make amends for her blunder , she sadly said , " It 's true , it 's true , everyonedoes have a cross to bear . " Cousin Katharine smiled and said , " I 'm only giving myself airs , Aunt Lowe . I fixed on this only because I thought the design was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross . " And herding them all out she asked her friends if they did not think that this was an occasionfor brown sherry , the drink she said she always associated with funerals . " The most delicious sherry I ever drank was after we buried Uncle Tim who was sop240extraordinarily glad to die . You know he was sensitive to noise to a degree and from the time he was fifty , prayed that in his old age he would go deaf . But he never did and , in fact , his hearing seemed to get sharper . The very last words he said were If there is whistling in the great beyond , I 'll kill myself . ' " They laughed , accepted the invitation to drink brown sherry in the library and started toward the house . " Good old Tim , " said Miss Duff . " Have n't thought of him in years . We 'll drink to silence in the great beyond . " Andrew lingered for a few minutes in the cool of the stable . The arrival of the gravestone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Cousin Katharine that it would be a sign , he had believed it . He had expected , for no reason now that he could think of , that the men who brought it would be dressed like executionersin black robes and peaked hoods and possibly even half-masks . And they had come , in harmless daylight , nothing more than ordinary workmen in dirty pants and blue shirts . He had been convinced that on this day they would learn of the end of Charles Smithwickand then all the waiting would be over , the nightmarewould be done and whatever it was that had been boiling in him all summer long would quiet down . He wanted to give up his obsession , but the obsession had resolutely stayed of its own accord . With his announcement to Cousin Katharine , it had reached a fever pitch , hotter and hotter until there was in his very heartbeat a voice that constantly said , " Charles Smithwick , die . " And the worst of it was thatp241he did not care any longer whether Charles Smithwick lived or died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , to be able to read Mark Twain and play poker with Honor and Harriet and have a little fun , for pete 's sake , but the voice would not let him be . It was an undertonewhen he was with other people , but when he 11 was alone , it was a roar and he had come to think that if Charles did n't die , this would go on for the rest of his life . He would never be able to study at school , he would flunk and be sent back or be subjected again to Bowman who would tutor him in that mausoleum house where his parents . . . Oh , his parents ! They would be home so soon , the summer was so nearly over ! At the thought of them , he turned and slapped Derek 's flank ; the horse disdainfully lifted his lip to show a row of grass-green teeth . He had definitely appointed this day as the day on which Charles would die not because there was any connection between his death and Cousin Katharine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew Shipley , could stand the voice no longer . And this morning , just as the truck was coming up the drive and just as Andrew was getting out of bed , what had he seen through his window but the lanky towheaded sailor himself sauntering down the road , looking as if he had never had an ache or a pain in his life ? At breakfast , which he could not eat , Cousin Katharine had come into the dining room to tell them that Charles was coming to help Maddox and Adam set off the fireworks on the next night.  |p242It  was really amazing that no one could hear the voice that made as much din in his blood and his brain as Victor 's yodeling ever did ; he sympathized with Uncle Tim . It was extremely loud and shrill just now and in order to modulate it , he crossed the lawn to watch the men who were putting up the stand for the orchestra beside the dancing platform . Below this , there had been pitched a red and white striped marquee for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , eating their lunch out of black boxes , their heads bent down in an attitude of diligence as if their very lives depended on the wedges of apple pie and the cold pork chops . When Andrew 's shadow fell across their picnic ground , one of them , Congreve Smithwick , looked up . He stopped in the act of cracking a hardboiledegg on his knee and stood up , brushing off his fingers on the seat of his pants , and came across to shake Andrew 's hand in both of his . He wore Victor 's knife at his belt . " I have been meaning to write you a **27;6642;TOOLONG for that knife , " he said , " and partly I took this odd-time job so I could tell you in person . I said at the time it was like manna from heaven because I sorely needed that knife . " " Connie treats that knife of his like it was a baby , " said another of the men through a mouthful of pie . " It 's all right , " murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the blade and from a pocket , he brought out a small whetstone ; he said that when he had nothingp243else to do , he spent his time sharpening it until now it was keen enough to shave with . " There 'll be no knife left when Connie gets through with it , " said the man who had spoken before . " Do you mind my asking one thing ? " said Connie . Even here , miles inland , he smelled as strongly of fish as the smoke-house . " What does V.S. stand for ? " " Very Simple , " said one of the men . " Virtue and Sin , " said another . " Go on ! " cried Smithwick . " My wife maintains you bought it for somebody else and those were their initials . But I maintain that you knew I needed a knife and you bought it for me . " He was in dead earnest , this credulous yokel , and Andrew thought what a simpleton he himself had been to imagine that he could ever in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not that Victor deserved it or anything else except , perhaps , a swift kick . " V.S. stands for , " he began and paused , trying to hit upon a hoodwink to while away the time till lunch . He thought of the Latin words veritas and semper which together sounded like a motto , but he did not want to sound snobby and so , instead , he invented a name and told Congreve Smithwick that the man who had made the knife was called Vernon Saltonstall . As long as he was talking , the voice was no louder than a whisper , rather like a purr , and so , sitting down among the men , he began to tell a long lie about the mythical cutler and how he had come to buy the knife , through mental telepathy , for Congreve Smithwick.  |p244Realizing  that no one believed him except Connie who listened , rapt , forgetting his lunch , he gave the other men a knowing , sidelong look from time to time and imperceptibly they winked . It was a snug , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular with his audience whose connivance and buried mirth spurred him on to higher and higher flights . He said that one afternoon after school as he was going through the Common , a man had given him a leaflet about Christian Science ( " C.S. , you see , " he said and Congreve Smithwick gaped and his companionshid their smiles with apples ) and just as he sat down to read it he thought he heard a voice that spoke to him , " Do you happen to know where I can get a knife ? I am a stranger here . " He had turned on the bench but there was no one nearby except a fat squirrel eating peanuts on the path ; this was in about January . Did that mean anything to Connie ? It certainly did ! The loony flushed and fidgeted and stammered that it had been January that he had lost his old knife which , anyhow , had never been much good . The fabrication rolled on and Congreve Smithwickbelieved every word . The more the men showed , by nods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the softer grew the voice inside him until finally , when he hesitated once in search of some fresh improbability , he realized that it was altogether gone . He was extremelyhappy being the center of attention , and all the time he was spinning out his yarn , he was thinking that Victor , after all , was not the only pebble on the beachp245and that he was going to ask permission to join this band of workmen as an apprentice or , if they did not need one , as a jester to amuse them during lunch . He imagined himself traveling with them throughout the county , becoming famous as an entertainer , Andrew Shipley , the One-Man Show . But before he had finished his account of Vernon Saltonstall , Honor burst out the front door crying , " Andrew ! Something awful 's happened ! " The men rose as a body and followed him like a herd of animals , muttering , " House on fire ? " " Somebodygot hurt ? " Connie Smithwick said , " Lucky I got my knife along in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there came with Andrew the voice , more insistent than it had ever been before and it was to it and not to his sister that he shouted , " I hear you ! Stop yelling at me ! " When he was at the columns he panted , " How did it happen ? " " How did it happen ? " she said . " How did what happen ? Did you do it ? Andrew Shipley , if you did it , I will never speak to you again in all my life and neither will Harriet or anyone else . " Harriet , the cool one , was in the hall . " Do n't be ridiculous , " she said . " Beth did it herself . " " Oh . The cat . " He turned to face the men ; he felt rather as if he were dismissing troops . " It 's just about a cat , " he told them and as they started back , disappointed , having hoped for an excitement , one of them said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Mr. Saltonstall. "  | " Mr. Saltonstall ! " whispered Harriet harshly . " You were n't telling them about the Saltonstalls ' divorce ! " " Ask me no questions and I 'll tell you no lies . " He had not known , until now , that the Saltonstalls were getting or had got a divorce . " What 's the big idea of yelling all over the place about a cat ? " Honor was crying and it was Harriet who had to tell him what had happened . It was awful , though awful in a way so different from what he had expected , dreaded and longed for that he was not nearly as horrifiedas he might have been at another time . Cousin Katharine had gone upstairs to get the key to the wine closet in the library and the ancients had waited and waited and finally Mrs. Wainright-Lowe had come into the drawing room where the twins were sewing and asked them to go see if something was wrong . Honor had been the one to go and she had found Cousin Katharinein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom and when Honor saw what had made her faint , she had almost fainted herself . Or died . For right in the middle of Cousin Katharine 's bed , right on the lace counterpane , lay one of Beth 's kittens with its head chewed off . Cousin Katharine had been brought around with aromaticspirits of ammonia administered by Mrs. Shea but had refused to have the doctor and in spite of their protests would not hear of her friends ' leaving without the sherry she had promised them . They were all in the library now and as the children entered , Miss Duff as coroner , in a visored cap , was conducting the inquestp247and helping herself liberally to the wine in the decanter . She looked a little tipsy or else a little thrilled . Certainly she was flinging herself wholeheartedly into what she called , from time to time , " a phenomenon of the first water . " No , said Cousin Katharine , Beth had not had an abnormal labor and Mrs. Shea , who had been with her , would bear her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the runt of the litter but he had been well-formed and as healthy as the others ; Cousin Katharine had promised him to Beulah Smithwickwho for some time had wanted a black cat . " Fitting , " said Mr. Barker . " I have always said that woman was a witch . " Enthralled , they probed the possible solutions to the mystery . Why had a cat , by nature secretive , left the body of her murdered kitten in a place so public ? And were the others now in danger of their lives ? Had Beth gone berserk like a human being , like those mothers and fathers one was always reading about who suddenly could not put up with the crying of their infants another minute and strangled them or fractured their skulls with the first object that came to hand ? Brantley Wainright-Lowesuggested that the cat 's mind " had lightly turned to thoughts of death " on this particular day becausethe tombstone had arrived and his mother , on wondering why the creature had chosen that particular method , was told severely by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how else could she have done it ? They discussedwhether or not Beth should be punished and Mr. Barker who knew a smattering of law said , parentheti/cally , that in ancient Greece , rocks that had fallen on people 's heads and killed them had been tried and sentenced and executed although he was not just sure how . " Pulverized , " asserted the omniscient Duff who had probably never heard of the practice until now . Obviously , she said , it was impossible to punish a cat ( except by putting it into a weighted gunny sack and dropping it into the lake from a boat ) and this was the reason why she , personally , would never own one . " Beat a dog once or twice and he knows who 's in charge but a cat , to my way of thinking , is devoid of any moral sense whatsoever . " Beth , the tribunal decided , would have to go scotfree . They clucked their tongues over the damage done to the counterpane ( " which must have cost a fortune , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had recently sufferedserious losses on the stock market which she could ill afford ) but said it was surprising how little blood there had been , leading them to believe that the deed had been done elsewhere and that the placing of the body on the bed had been an afterthought . They remarked , offended , the complacency of the animal when they had all gone up , the very picture of motherly love and pride , lying there in the pretty basket with her remaining kittens suckling her , purring and holding up her pansy face to have her cheeks stroked as if she had just done something bright . They talked of other cases in the lower orders in which the maternal instinct went amiss , of ewes that abandoned their ailing lambs andp249neurasthenic turkeys that would not take care of their eggs ; but no one had ever heard of anything so gross as this , even in the order homo sapiens , and they did not wonder that Katharine had fainted dead away . But it was evident that Mrs. Tyler and Miss Duff thought there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Andrew saw how they looked alternately at her and at each other , ever so slightly inclining their heads or elevating one shoulder and Mrs. Tyler began presently to make an attempt to get the others to leave . Had n't Mrs. Wainright-Lowe planned to catch butterfliesbefore lunch ? Did n't Mr. Barker always work up his appetite with a brisk walk ? Was she wrong in her belief that Celia Heminway was under strict doctor 's orders to rest , rest and rest some more and especially before meals ? How well trained the Shipley children were to listen so patiently to grown-up conversation when they must be wild to be outdoors ! Just a few minutes before , she had seen Andrew down with the men . . . boys did have such a jolly time around men who were working with hammers and saws . But no one made any move at all to go and , inspired with the unusual events of the morning , they allowed their sherry glasses to be refilled and did n't mind saying that they were rather shaken , juvenile as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cat and so young a cat that it had not even developed any personality . Foiled , the diagnosticians were obliged to content themselves with a close surveillance of Cousin Katharine.  |p250She  had not touched the little green-stemmed glass of wine on the table beside her ; earlier , Andrew had seen her start to pick it up but her hand was so unsteady that she could not have carried it to her lips and she put it back again . She entered into the conversation only to the extent that her role as hostess required her and did not add to the fund of parallel cases nor offer any theories . She sat in the midst of her friends , gambolingin their second childhood , as pale and unblemishedas the filmy pink dimity she wore and she seemed , by her straight back and her tightly clasped hands and by the way she held her head at a slightly backward angle , to be listening for something . She was not listening to the voices of her friends but to some sound beyond the room or even beyond the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it too . He could hear the drone of the lawn mowers and the erratic pounding of the hammers ; he heard a motorboat'srapid snore diminishing . Nearer , he could hear someone moving about upstairs and he heard the sound of Honor 's ballet slipper as she traced a parabola with her left toe on the newly waxed floor . And then his interior voice , which had been silent for some time , began clamoring . Was that what she was listening to ? Could she hear it all the way across the room ? His heart banged brassily and he edged backward out of the door . Just as he was about to turn , Cousin Katharineseemed to rouse herself , shaking her head a little as if she had dropped off to sleep and as he watched , the color came back to her face and she smiled and herp251quiet hand picked up her wineglass and said , " This is no time to be triste on the eve of my party ! " They toasted the party and Harriet said , " Oh , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party and not about that cat . " " I should have expected something of the kind , " said Cousin Katharine . " It was days and days ago that Andrewtold me on the day my stone arrived something awful was going to happen . " " He did n't ! " cried Honor and reached out to seize him by the arm , but he flung away from her and stood just for a moment in the doorway before he ran . " You did do it ! " she whispered but Harriet again defended him . " You are insane . Do you think anybody in the world would chew the head off a kitten ? It was gnawed , Honor . It must have taken her hours . " " Lucky guess , " said Wainright-Lowe , leering at Andrew . " If it had n't been pussy I suppose there would have been some other little old carnage . " He laughed indulgently . " Boys will be boys . I was a boy myself once , believe it or not . " They all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Tyler , as if he were five years old , said , " He did n't want his cousin to get a tombstone , did he ? Nobody wants to think that anyone close and dear is going to pass away , does he ? Between you and me and the gatepost , Andy , " she cupped her hand around her mouth and whispered loudly and he hated her for using a nickname that only strangers ever used and sometimes his father when he was in a falselyp252jocose humour , " this lady is going to live to be a hun-dred . " " Andrew does n't care , " said Honor but softly so that the others did not hear . " Andrew has no heart . You willed that little helpless baby cat to die . " " Honor , be quiet , " said Harriet sharply . " You 'll make him have a mood . Besides , he did n't do it . " Now Cousin Katharine , released from her strain , was really laughing and she said , " Will it make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a billiard table on top of it ? Does that seem too bizarre or would n't it be rather a lark to let people play on it tomorrow night ? The ones who are coming from a distance wo n't know what 's underneath the baize . " " Kate , you 're the limit ! " cried Mr. Barker and laughed so hard that he had to wipe his eyes with the neatly folded ornamental handkerchief in his coat pocket . " And then you would unveil it afterward , I suppose ? " " Most gruesome thing I ever heard of , " said Miss Duff , " but knowing you , I 'm not going to be surprised if you do it . " " Listen ! " said Cousin Katharine suddenly . Her smile was gone again and again she sat up straight . " Listen ! Is that the wind ? That sound ? " He ran then through the corridor and out of the house and down to the dancing platform and stood in the middle of it with all the men around him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " I want to get something straight in my head about this Vernon Saltonstall , " said another . " Did he knowp253about Connie needing the knife too or did you pass that along to him ? " He had to shout over the voice to make them hear . Dizzied , he could only dimly see their faces , swimming in the hot sunlight . He shrieked that this was the last knife that Vernon Saltonstall had ever made because , with it , he had stabbed a man to death and he had given it to Andrew just before he went to the electric chair . The waving faces that had been split apart in grins began to seal themselves together and he heard someonesay , " Take it easy , son . " Finally , pausing for breath , his eyes focused on Congreve Smithwick whose stupid mouth was open wide and who was staring at the knife in his hands . Momentarily the men had all stopped working ; an enormously tall one with a pock-marked face went over to Connie and put his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your knife , it ai n't bad luck . The boy is only poetizing . " The hammer beganagain and he knew that they had had enough of him . " You ought to be a story writer , " said the man who was consoling Connie . " Good luck , boy . " With this he was dismissed and he drifted down the lawn toward the hammock . The voice , mercifully , seemed to be as tired as he was and though it was still there it was slow , like the pendulum of the grandfather clock . As he lay down , he saw Victor and Charles meanderingdown the road , carrying pails and diggers . He coveredhis eyes with the pillow and put his fingers in his ears and he counted by fives to a hundred and fifty untilp254he was sure they were out of sight . Out of sight and out of mind . He flopped over then and aloud he said , " You get out of my sight and out of my mind , you Smithwicks . " He began to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of a still moonlight midnight when they had stolen out of their houses and had met in the graveyard of St. James 's to tell each other ghost stories ; he thought of the solemn rite of the alewives and the raspberry tonic , of the parrot , and the pet vixen and Billy Bartholomew 's batteryradio , and the seals , and the eels , and when Maureen came down to tell him that lunch was ready , he was crying so hard that she had to call him twice before he heard her.  | " BEEN DOWN in the garden when Maddox , the Dragon , was n't there , " boomed Peg Duff from the lawn . " Your Ulrich Brunners are gorgeous . " Katharine stroked the coon-cat who was dozing in the last of the sun on the windowsill . " They 're his especialpride , " she said , " those and his Dr. Hueys . " She had often wondered why he chose to call his roses by variations on her name when their own were so sonorous : Baroness Rothschild , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was a tribute , and she would not have liked it if he had changed . " Any signs of remorse in the creature ? " Peg pointed at the cat . " None that I 've seen . Her appetite is excellent . " " You have a forgiving nature , I must say , " saidp256Peg . " If I were you , I would n't touch the little bitchwith a ten-foot pole . You did say buffet , did n't you ? I told Maxine I would n't fool with dinner . " " I did . How do you like the looks of things , Peg ? Does n't it all seem like old times ? " Miss Duff looked around the lawn at the dancing platform where crepe-paper lanterns hung and the candy-cane marquee and the moon , as big as an archery target , hanging between the elm trees with a man in it looking like Theodore Roosevelt disguised as the man in the moon , and the round raised dais for the orchestra like a bandstand in a village park . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " It does seem only yesterday . I can see George Congreve as clearly as if he were standing at my elbow . He would dance the first dance and the last if you recall and in between times he would be in that everlasting library of his with a crony , holding a gab-fest in Greek . What was it he called the writing room ? " " He called it his microcosmal Athenaeum . ' Papa was a bit of a pedant . " " But a lamb , " said Miss Duff and then , embarrassed by her sentimentality , she resumed her gruffness . " Got to get ready for your shindig . Forgot to tell Maxine to press my best bib and tucker . " Touching her khaki cap , she strode off across the lawn . There had been much life within this house , thought Katharine , when the guest rooms had been occupied by long-term visitors , agreeable scholars with whom herp257father had all but talked in Greek , and feminist friends of her mother whom the men had controlled by turningupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pugnacious Mrs. Rowe who had once inquired of an English Latinist his opinion of Mary Wollstonecraft and the man had answered , " Do you mean the lady who felt it was right to expose the limbs so long as they were clad in blue stockings ? " Worlds apart , the visitors , nevertheless , had not encroached upon each other 's provinces ; the Amazons went out to war for principles and rights while the men stayed indoors in their ivory tower . The sense of ease and holiday had made them tolerant and there were even times when they met on the commonground of play . ( Was tennis not the same game it had been then ? Why did it seem , today , so much faster ? ) She grappled for the lost time , for the interplay of learned wit , for music as music had sounded then . She hunted , in the hollow of the present time , for the sensationsthat had once enlivened her on such an evening as this before a party , for those sensations that now were flittering over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were ready to cry , ready to laugh hysterically , equally ready to fall in love and to spoil all their chances by gabbling nonsense . She had seen them a little while ago in Honor 's room , fresh and pink and fragrant from their baths , wearing lacy slips , pinning up their hair ; breathless and intent , they had been sitting side by side before the dressing table , making braids with which to crown and age themselves and they had notp258known that she was watching them . Honor 's blue dress lay on the bed with its morning-glory skirt spread out and beside it was a pair of brand-new silver dancing slippers . The party , after all , thought Katharine , was not for her and the cremation of her regrets , but it was for these flower-like , simple , punctiliously feminine girls , devoutly putting all their eggs in one basket . Their pantomime was as graceful and as fundamental and as revealing as the dances of birds , and Katharine tiptoed away . For the point of the ball , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended still to burn her diary after the guests were gone and the lanterns had been extinguished , she did not expect to arise from the ashes of it ; the act was far more expedient than symbolic ( but because she died hard and gave up her habits of thought grudgingly , she could not relinquish the two small rituals of time and place ; she would destroyit after the commemorative ball and in her father 's study ) . And the act necessary rather than elective . It was an act and not a gesture for , uncertain of the course her life was pow to take , she did not want to leave behind these lares to be rummaged through . If they had not been already rummaged through ! Her fear of Andrew was inescapable . What he knew , she could not guess , nor could she guess the terms by which he scrutinized his knowledge , but yesterday in the library when she had asked the others if they heard a sound and they had not , he had turned at once and run from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heels , he had given her a look that she had construedas unspeakable hatred . He had looked at her through half-closed eyes and his lips parted in contempt . It had been the fear of him that had made her faint earlier when she found the mangled kitten . Before she lost consciousness , she had attributed to Andrew the sophisticated blackmail of this desecration of her bed , and she remembered that as she began to fall , she had vainly tried to call him in the intention , as she now supposed , of finally ferreting out of him the reason for his preoccupation , unbroken since the day he had arrived . She had been alarmed when Maureen had found him crying in the hammock , so passionately and convulsivelythat the maid had had to take him by the hand and lead him , stumbling , blind with his tears . And still , he had allowed himself , like a much younger and much more pliant child , to be consoled with promises . He was to help set off the fireworks and if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house from Thomas to Hawthorne ; his requests had been so normal and so boyish that for a while she had been reassured . He had even nestled against her for a pitiful moment and the shudder of his final sobs , runningthe length of his body , had been copied in her own nerves and muscles . But she had not been convinced that the freshet of his tears had been released , as he said it had , by a bee sting , for he was a Spartan child ( all Congreves , Shipleys , Maxwells were physicallyp260courageous if that was any virtue ) who would never admit to fatigue or aches . " It 's the excitement of the party , " said Maureen to her privately and , having no wish to analyze her cousin with anyone , she agreed . " It 's the gravestone that makes him sad if you 'll pardon me for saying so , Miss Congreve , " said Mrs. Shea and Katharine nodded her head . Mary said he had had too little breakfast and too much sun and Harriet accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud boy stuck to his story of the bee and even asked for baking soda which he took up to his room , saying , with an attempt at a smirk , that he would have to make the application himself because the " scurvy bee " had stung him in the belly button . All afternoon he had mooned in the hammock , and all of this day he had been invisible except at breakfast and lunch . It was almost four o'clock when he had come up from the direction of the lake with a string of fish , the very last thing on earth anyone wanted today , and when Mrs. Shea , who was on the verge of tears with worry over the success of her meringues , ordered him to take his reptiles back where they came from , he had savagely flung them into the garbage pail beside the door , thrown his rod into the lettuce bed and thudded upstairs to his room from which presently there came to the ears of the edgy household the sound of his jew's-harp squeaking through the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , a little later , he had knocked on her door and had asked to see Beth and had shown only a natural curiosity to know , as Peg Duffp261had wanted to know , if Beth was sorry for what she had done . Thoughtfully , using the terms of the newspapers as glibly as if this were his ordinary speech , he said , " I think it was a mercy killing . I think there was something wrong with the kitten that the cat would know and we would n't . It may have fallen down and sustainedinjuries , in which case she ought to be shown clemency . " Katharine dressed slowly , taking a long time before her mirror to brush her hair into a Psyche knot and plait it with a string of baroque pearls ; with silver hairpinsshe arranged in it two rosebuds , doled out grudginglyby Maddox who hated parties because they meant that his gardens were stripped to fill the vases ; he had once , in all seriousness , suggested that she keep artificial flowers in the house . Her dress was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yards of mousseline de soie , cloud-white and gossamer , cascaded over a ridge of crinolineat the waist and fell to the floor , showing through its mobile folds a full and pale blue rustling petticoat ; the dead-white satin bodice was cut low at the shoulders , smooth and unornamented , for she had refused Beulah 's suggestion of a frill of starched lace at the neck . No matter how gifted they were , these diamondsin-the-rough , they could not leave well enough alone but wanted always to add extras to their work . It had required consummate diplomacy to keep Mr. Norman from carving a bed of roses for her to lie on , and one year she had disputed a full afternoon with a carpenterp262who had come to repair the capital of one of the columns and who had implored her to let him make a connecting molding across the front of the house , loopinga wooden ribbon from pillar to pillar . Or let him , even better , take down these useless " fence posts " and build for her a porch on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more comfortably watch the world go by than she could on her terrace . He had advocated , she shuddered to remember , screens . She had withstood Beulah Smithwick 's further suggestion that she wear a high Spanish comb like a battlement upon her castled hair . It was dusk . Maddox was lighting the candles in the lanterns with a taper longer than himself and the small orchestra were tuning their fiddles and a cello . They were five old German brothers with faded brown faces like withered apples who had arrived that afternoon from Boston , overwhelmed with happiness to leave the city 's heat and to find a landscape that reminded them of the Tauber valley . The sweet and sour scraping of the violins and the swaying of the lanterns at the touch of the taper and the smell of the coffee that was being brewed in the dining room in the immense urn made her tremble with expectation and suddenly she wished she had invited an escort for herself ; even Jack Codman , who was a simpleton , could have been metamorphosedthrough her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask her if they " looked all right " perfectly knowing and preening themselves on the knowledge that nothing could have improvedupon their looks . They pirouetted before her long glass and boldly sprayed themselves with her perfumeand exclaimed rhapsodically as they leaned out the windows to look at the lanterns and at all the other finery of the lawn . A regiment of servants recruited from the kitchens of her friends were stationing the punch bowls on the long tables under the marquee and covered platters of salmon mousse and lobster salad and partridge in aspic and daube glace . From Honor 's windows , they had earlier seen wine coolers and bottles of burgundy and magnums of champagnebeing taken to the summerhouse . Could they have champagne ? They knew they would be too excitedto eat a bite , would Cousin Katharine be able to ? Was she sure that this way of doing their hair was becoming ? Their skirts were not too long ? Were the seams of their stockings straight ? Would she not grant that their shoes were absolutely the last word in chic ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their questions , for the ecstasy of their anticipation was their sole concern . They did not even notice Katharine 's dress and she was shocked to realize that their failure to do so wounded her ; she was cast into a shadow by their conflagration , for they were so very young ! And their hearts were so very simple and their minds were so clear and shallow , their ambitions so modest and direct that she was certain they would never come to grief.  |p264Theirs  , in the end , was the supreme talent : they had the talent for happiness and it radiated from them even in their perpetration of these addled , adolescent idiocies ; it was their one depth and it amazed her for they had had neither the help of heredity or environment to bring about its cultivation . The first car to come up the drive was James Partridge'syellow roadster and , beside themselves , the girls froze at their post and in the end had to be urged and all but pushed downstairs to receive the boys . Katharine heard them , refusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the headmistressof their school as if she were a subject of pressing interest . Now Edmund 's car came in between the maple trees and when she saw him get out , his plumpness seeming everywhere to push at his clothes , a momentary disenchantmentchilled her ; the evening lost its dimension of romance and the violins grated and the lanterns appearedsleazy and absurd . Edmund 's temerity had been put to flight at once as soon as she had fainted and he kept a nervous distance from her now even while he continued , out of habit , to cast lovelorn glances at her and endeavoured at large gatherings to be alone with her to pay her some proprietary compliment . She had awakened that day in the drawing room to hear him say , " I 'm staggered . I thought Katharine was made of iron . " The violence of her reaction to his profession  --  for he would have no way of knowing that a far greater weight had crushed her down  --  had flattered him a littlep265but far more had dismayed him and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed only with the letter " E " in which he implied that he had thought she knew all along that he had only been joking . His need for her , now that he saw she was in need , was gone . The house was lighted tonight only with candles and , by accident , with the green flashing of fireflies , and as she went down the stairs , hearing her sibilant petticoat , she thought it had never been more magnificent . Always immaculate , it had been washed and polished and burnishedfrom the cellars to the attics for this occasion so that glass glittered and metal burned and wood gleamed like hide . Perfect and plenteous , Congreve House was the locus but was also the extension of herself ; not the events that had taken place in it which she had clung to out of her stubborn self-destruction , but the very paneled walls themselves and the wide random boards of the floors and the marble mantels and , above all , the ironic spirit of the house , mature ( as she must learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her efforts to destroy herself ) . It was her father who had imbued the house with its spirit of acceptance ; she looked back up the stairs at his portrait and was ashamed , meeting the face in which judgement and resignation were balanced equally . As if he were there and had held her up to friendly ridicule , had said all this emotion was infantile and unattractive , she felt her broken structure begin to mend , begin top266move articulately , and whole , mistress of Congreve House , she emerged from the embrace of it into the summer evening . For the first time , Andrew had a close look at Charles Smithwick . He had come into the stable where Adam was teaching Andrew to play pool on Cousin Katharine 's tombstone ( she really had done it and Adam had told him what Billy Bartholomew had said when he had heard of it . He had said , " She has bats in her belfry as big as my old white horse " ) and began at once to correctAdam , saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you how . " He wore a pin-striped business suit , much too small , so that his knobby wrists hung long below the sleeves and the tops of his white socks were visible below his trouser cuffs ; he wore a proper white , starched shirt , a red bow tie and squeaky ox-blood shoes . He looked dressed for a business interview , and he was so brash and toplofty that Andrew wanted to ask him if that suit was left over from high-school graduation or if it belonged to Victor . Popping his gum loudly , he said . " Who 's getting the twenty-one gun salute ? " And when Adam asked him what he meant by that , he said , " Who 's the blow-out for ? The king of Canada ? Or the Jewish postmaster general ? " He sneered at everything though Adam tried to shush him because of Andrew . He said , " Oh , stow it . It 's ap267free country , ai n't it ? " He said he had never seen anything on land or sea to beat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought she was kidding , the kindergarten ? Was that the band ? That bunch of dried-up hardware salesmen-looking shrimps ? He had bright tumid lips and stupid , glassy eyes , and the smell of his Juicy Fruit gum was sickening . " How come the pool hall 's here ? " he asked , and immediatelyleaped back , sending the cue ball lolloping down the felt . " Oh , hey , Billy told me . Jesus , that gives me the creeps ! " Serious for a moment , he looked around uneasily and started when Pegasus gave forth a muted whinny . But seeing Adam start to make a shot , his egotism overrode his uneasiness and he came back to the table to offer advice . " When are you going back to your ship ? " asked Andrewand Charles , intent on pocketing the red ball said , " One of these days if I feel like it . " " How do you feel ? " Andrew watched him from the foot of the table and hoped he would miss the shot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely into the pocket and Charles gave himself a warm handshake . " How do I feel ? Well , I 'll tell you . Some days I feel like a million and some days I feel as good for nothing as one red cent . I 'm up and then I 'm down , if you follow my meaning . " " On the days you 're up ' do you do things with Victor ? You know , like fishing ? I mean do you dig clams and things like that ? "  | " Oh , sure , " he said . " Yeah , I play nursemaid to the kid brother . " " Missed ! " crowed Adam for Charles 's ball had sailed past the pocket . The sailor snapped his fingers . " You joggled my elbow , dammit , " he said . It was not true ; Adam had not been anywhere near him . Andrew was delighted to find that besides being a braggart Charles was a liar and a bad loser . " Well , on the days you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do ? " " Lie around the house and wish I was dead . " " Do you really wish you were dead ? " " You betcha I do . And you would too if you felt like you had a buzz saw in your bread-basket . " He stopped in the act of taking his stance for another shot and addressing Adam he mused , " You know about that wishing you were dead , it 's a funny thing . Once or twice , I 've gotten to feel so god-awful that if somebody came along and offered to shoot me , I swear I think I 'd take them up on it . I never would go and do it myself because in my opinion people that commit suicide are cowards and I do n't care what reasons they give or how they try to whitewash it . But if some one of these traveling nomad gypsies came up in the yard and offered to kill me I swear I think I 'd say hop to it ' if I was feeling the way I sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backward into a shadow . " What 's that ? " said Charles Srithwick . " Is that a musical saw ? "  |p269Andrew  's throat constricted suddenly . The air seemed shut off by a thin membrane . " That 's one of the twin girls singing , " said Adam . " Miss Honor or Miss Harriet , I ca n't tell them apart unless they 're standing side by side and then I know that one of them is on the east and the other is on the west . " Through the roars of his own voice , Andrew could hear Harriet , somewhere close by , singing James Partridge'sfavorite song , his favorite because his name was in it , " On the first day of Christmas , my true love brought to me a partridge in a pear tree . " " No kidding , I mean it , " said Charles reverently . " It 's like a lady I heard playing the musical saw in Tokyo . " Her voice diminished with distance and then it stopped as the orchestra began to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , began to talk in man-tomaninnuendoes of geisha girls . Andrew left the barn , driven by the voice that clashed and clanged like a brass band and boomed like kettledrums , although he did not care . Charles was stuck on himself and rude and unlikeable , but Andrew did not care . Between clenched teeth , he said furiously to the voice , " Shut up . I say , shut up . " He felt no part of this festival gathering . He watched the dancers on the platform , circling and dipping in the waltz , his sisters ' blue skirts whirling out as round and round the outer edges they danced with Raoul and James . Cousin Katharine was dancing with Mr. St.p270Denis who looked like a porpoise and wore the kind of mess-jacket Mr. Barker 's butler wore . If Andrew had to dance , he thought , that would be the very end . He moved down toward the pond where a group of older people were sitting , hoping that their conversation would be interesting enough to drown out the voice , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were news , that the face of the man in the moon was accounted for by craters . He wondered contemptuously if anyone had told them about the Easter rabbit . There followed some dispute over the identity of the man in Katharine 's artificialmoon but it was agreed , at length , that it looked the most like Theodore Roosevelt . " The Rough Rider , " explained Miss Duff , who had also posited the original statement about the craters of the moon . " Invented the word mollycoddle . " She was ignored though several people smiled politely at her . " The only things left out of this picture , " said a dreamy-eyed old lady Andrew had never seen before , " are John Shipley and Maeve . Do they never come to Hawthorne now ? " " Sometimes they come to take the young fry back , that 's all , " said Miss Duff . " They 're city people . City people do n't know what they 're missing by not getting on the land . " " Is Katharine quite well again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some very roundabout way that she had n't been well this summer . " The talk was diverted then to the fainting fit of yesterdayand what had brought it on and Miss Duff wentp271through the whole post-mortem again while Mr. Barker implored her not to go on , seeming to feel that she was somehow blackening the name of Hawthorne and of Congreve House . " I do n't see how she can stand to have the cat in the house after what happened , " she concluded . " I 'd be reminded of that mess every time I looked at a cat . " Mr. Barker said , " That 's nonsense , Peg . One must rise above such things . Else would we not quail at the sight of the Atlantic because the Lusitania went down ? At oil lamps because Mrs. O'Leary 's cow kicked one over ? " " Always wanted to see Chicago , " said Miss Duff . This message was followed immediately by another , " First dance over . Katharine coming this way , no more talk of you-know-what . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sounded frequently like a greeting card . He got up and said , " Hail to the mistress of ceremonies ! Methought I had wandered into Arcadia . " " You all must go and dance , " cried Cousin Katharine . " Too old to dance , " said Miss Duff , but Mr. St. Denis bullied her to her feet , laughing noisily , and in her surpriseshe permitted herself to be propelled across the lawn and up to the platform ; she danced like a bundle of sticks . " The very picture of carefree youth , " said Mrs. Tyler peevishly . " I mean , of course , the Shipley girls and their swains . " " Oh , surely you do n't think that youth is carefree , "  |p272said  the woman who missed John and Maeve . " At their age  --  perhaps a bit older , I was wretched . Growing up for me was like coming out of purdah . To be relieved at last of those awful jealousies ! Those dashed hopes ! " Except for Mrs. Tyler who held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure lay within the girls ' appearance of it , the elders on the terrace agreed that they would not for anything be under thirty-five again . They complimented Cousin Katharine on the music and though they would not agree to dance , for all her urging , they would agree to eat and drink . In pairs and threes they drifted away from the terrace in the direction of the buffet and of Minerva 's temple . When they had gone , Cousin Katharine loitered , picking up the petals of a shattered flower that lay on the stones . She came to the edge of the pond , so close to Andrew that he could have reached out from the shadow that hid him and touched her dress . He saw her toss the petals onto the black water and watch the swans move slowly toward them . She seemed , again , to be listening . He looked at her and then looked up at the stable where Charles Smithwick was standing to one side of the door to let two of the men guests by . " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly . She put both her hands over her heart but she turned her head very slowly and when she spoke , her voice was even . " Do you mean the pump , dear ? Or do you mean the music ? " Picking up her skirts so that the grass would not stainp273them , she went back to her party to mingle with her fifty happy guests , pretending that she had not heard the voice . Always pretending ! He would have to go somewhere to drown it out by screaming ; sometimes it stopped for a while if he ran fast . He ran now across the meadow and when he was deep in the pine-woods , near the Indian burying ground , he hallooed to himself , " Androoo ! Yoo-hooooo ! Androoooo Shiii-pley ! " It was the longest party Andrew had ever been to or ever heard of . The first people had come before six o'clock and at midnight they behaved as if they had just arrived . There was a steady parade of servants bringing fresh platters of food down from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill up the bowls . In the summerhouse the grownups were drinking wine from George Congreve 's cellar and champagne that Mr. Barker had brought . The orchestra , barely pausing between waltzes , went on like a perpetual motion machinewithout a sign of fatigue . Down in the meadow , Andrew waited with Adam and Maddox and Charles for the signal to begin shooting off the fireworks . They stood at the four corners of the square they had sickled down that afternoon and all of their hands itched to get at the flares and skyrockets in their bright Chinese wrappings . The road in front of Congreve House was crowded with the townspeople standing on the running boards of cars and even , in the case of children , sitting on the topsp274of them . " The rabble waits without , " Andrew had heard Mr. Barker say to Cousin Katharine and Miss Duff had growled , " Typical . Always after something free gratis for nothing . " But Cousin Katharine defended them , said she had let it be known that everyone was welcome and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had not come . She was flushed with high spirits and to three differentpeople , he had heard her say , " I have never been happier in my whole life ! " and Edmund St. Denis , quite drunk and trouty , remarked to no one in particular , " She does n't look a day over sixteen . I say Katharine Congreve is nonpareil , " and as if someone were about to deny it , he tentatively put up his hands for a fistfight . Everyone was there except Em Bugtown who was down with summer complaint . Billy Bartholomew was there on Carrie Nation who wore an old Western saddle with the pommel broken off ; he sat in it as if he were sitting in a chair and tilting it back on two legs . " First we 'll see her ladyship 's pyrotechnical to-do and then every able-bodied man in the county will spend the rest of the mortal night in a bucket brigade putting out the forest fire , " he declared in a voice of doom and his wife , a safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dry up . Poor Hollis was there and so was his mother ; she was very small and withered but she had her arm around her son as if he were an infant . They were near the gate and Andrew had seen how , when Billy 's angry voice frightened Poor Hollis , his mother tugged himp275closer to her and he heard her say , " There , now , let me hear you ring your pretty bell . " Jasper , the epileptic , was treading an erratic path up and down the road and Billy said , " He 'll be going in circles , sure as shooting . Somebody 'd better go get the paddywagon for the inevitableevent of our fair city . " They had been waiting an eternity when Andrew saw someone coming up from the lower edge of the meadow . In a moment , as the figure came closer , he recognized Victor Smithwick 's lope , a wasteful gait in which the arms and the head participated far more than necessary . He went directly to his brother without so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-letter word for legal excuse ' was ? Alibi ! " " I 'll be damned , " said Charles . " I did n't know alibi was a legal excuse . I thought it was just the opposite . I mean I thought an alibi was an illegal excuse . " " Hello , Victor , " said Andrew . Victor peered across at him . " Oh , hello , there , Shipshape . I did n't recognize you with your hat on , " and the brothers burst into laughter . " Did you shoot pool ? You know where I mean ? " Victor 's voice shook with giggles . They held a conversation , Victor and Charles , showing off the security of their brotherhood as Honor and Harriet often did , laughing madly at allusions no one could understand except themselves , speaking in a kind of code so that a listener felt himself to be the butt of jokes , pilloried and hooted at . What had happened to Victor 's admiration of Cousin Katharine that he would make fun of her tombstone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatsis but meanly , like Billy Bartholomew ? What was the matter with him that he had spent this whole evening at home doing a crossword puzzle when he might have been here where everyone else was ? Everyone including his brother ? There was only one possible answer , that he could not bear the sight of Andrew . " Anchors aweigh ! " cried Charles , breaking off in the middle of an exposition on the differences between billiardsand pool and those between real pool and the kind of pool that Adam played . " We 're off , " said Maddox , for the signal had been given . The orchestra had stopped playing and through a megaphone , James Partridge , elected because both the twins were in love with him and were under the impression , therefore , that the party was in his honor , announced that the fireworks display was now to take place and that his " gracious hostess " had asked him to say that the dancing would continue when it was over . Adam and Andrew set off the first two girandoles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one toward the river , bursting five times . From the dying shower of scarlet , there shot a higher spray of violet from which sprang blue , then green and the far , last opening cone was brilliant gold . When the last of the sparks had perished , applause came gustily from the road and the lawn and then everyone fell silent , waitingp277as if for the curtain to rise in the theater on the next act . In the south sky they saw a blood-red waterfall and in the north a silver rain . An ephemeral sun , hissed into existence , hung in the summer firmament , blotting out the Pleiades . They saw serpents coiling upward to dissolveat the highest point of their path into radiant green stars . The tourbillion fires ascended , spiraling straight into the sky and beneath them , like a ballet chorus , the small pastilles spun themselves quickly to nothing . Two of the skyrockets were delinquent and ploughed through the timothy to fizzle out , but all the others , the blazing , blasting garnitures and galaxies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be five Catherine wheels , set in the clearing , four of them revolving simultaneously and the fifth coming a little later as the premiere danseuse . Andrewwas watching a curving rain of gold falling , gently like snow and dying in the air above the pine trees by the lake when he heard Cousin Katharine 's voice behind him . " I have come to superintend the final outburst , " she was saying to Maddox . " It has been stupendous . " Respectful of the men , she stood aside and Andrew saw Victor move toward her and heard her say , " Victor Smithwick ! You 're a total stranger these days . Why did n't you come earlier to stand on your head ? Your mother tells me you have got a whole book of crossword puzzles . I 'll tell you one thing , slave ' is always esne . ' " Victor started to reply but she silenced him , " We 'll talk about ers and ems another day . The Catherine wheels are going off . "  |p278Andrew  and Maddox and Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches to set off the fuses and leaped back into the tall grass . In a moment , Charles ran forward again to light the fifth . There was a flare too low and everyone at the same time realized that the Catherine wheel was a dud . He heard Adam say , " Too bad to spoil the grand march , " and then he saw fire illumine Charles 's face as he knelt , still trying to make the wheel go off . His high white hair was on fire ! Charles Smithwick 's head was blazing like a torch ! It had been bending over , the head with its shock of coarse hay-hair , and the gunpowder had set it on fire ! It was a Catherine wheel that was killing Victor 's brother , it was beloved Cousin Katharine 's quick , ravishing wheel that would burn him up as it burned itself up , while in the stable her other one , motionless in stone , was as cool and as permanent as the sky . Andrew had been right , after all : her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assailed by the voice , bending with it and resisting it . He was a tree and this was the wind and he could not move a step forward because his obstinate roots were in the ground . He saw the other four of them , his cousin first , rush to pound and stamp Charles with their hands . The fire eddied like a thin , roiled liquid at their feet , burning the bodies of the used matches and the seepings from the rocket cases , and the sailor , turned into a candle , squawled . " Now do you hear it , Cousin Katharine ? You hear the voice inside my head , do n't you ? " roared Andrewp279above all the other cries from the startled bystanders in the road and on the lawn . But she was busy . She was beating the sailor 's head to save his life and her white skirt was on fire at the hem . He watched , fascinated , as it ate scallops into the filmy cloth . " Katharine ! " Mr. St. Denis came scrambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came a phalanx of men and behind them came Honor and Harriet . The gardener was the first of the men below to see that her skirt was burning and , leaving Charles , he seized her by the arm and pulled her down into the higher grass , but then , insane with terror and confusion , she evaded him and ran by herself in a widening circle , fanning the fire until it reached her waist ; she screamed unceasingly . A battalion of her guests closed in upon her , like dogs on a fox , and someone managed at last to fling her to the ground and roll her , as if she were inanimate , until the ravenous flames stopped eating her . For a minute , there was a vast , unnatural silence and in it , as soft as an insect sound , Andrew heard the tinkle of Poor Hollis 's bell . He turned a little in the direction of that soft , affectionatenoise and as he did so he saw Charles Smithwick standing where his rescuers had abandoned him for Cousin Katharine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head but he was already beginning to relax from his surprise ; in a moment , unhurt , he went to join the others.  |p280After  they had taken her up to the house and after all had been done that could be done , it was Andrew that she asked to see . At the sight of her hideous black face and the intolerable , sickening suffering in her eyes , his misery pushed before it a tide of tears . Her arms were swathed in bandages and there was a turban of gauze wound round and round her head . But her voice , though it was weak and hesitant , was almost her own when she said , " I heard it , Andrew . I heard it when you heard it . " He swayed against the bedpost , sightless with his tears ; it seemed a sacrilege to make these gulping , baby sounds but he could not stop . The pain must have driven her out of her head for when she spoke again she said , " I heard the Catherine wheel swinging low to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it swung , it swung , it swung . . . " She tried to move her hands to imitate the revolvinglights , but the least motion was agony and she moaned . Across the bed from him the doctor nodded his head in some signal that Andrew could not understand at first and then he indicated that the boy should move closer to his cousin . Reluctantly , he edged along the bed until he was looking directly down on her dying , unrecognizableface . " Is that boy all right ? Charles Smithwick ? " Before Andrew was obliged to answer , the doctor said , " Do n't trouble yourself on that score . His hair was singed , that 's all . He 's home asleep by now , resting up to go back to his ship next week . "  |p281Her  voice grew slower and slower as if she were going to sleep and long pauses came after each word . " Andrew , " she said , " do this for me. " fake my big red diary and burn it . And forgive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing she said , she said to herself . " Ile was not worth it . " Oh , no , no , he had not been worth it ! Victor Smithwick'sfriendship had not been worth the shortest moment of Cousin Katharine 's love . When at last he found it and could use it again , his voice came out in a questioningplea , " Cousin Katharine ? You 're the only person I ever loved , ever , ever , ever ! " He could tell that she was trying to smile but her lips barely moved and her eyes seemed not to focus . The doctor , bringing the diary to Andrew , put it into his hands and told him to leave . He took the heavy book down to the kitchen where the fire was banked in the coal stove and leaf by leaf , without reading a word of them , he fed the pages to it , his big tears hissing and skittering away in minute bubbles on the iron lids . The thin leaves curled and disintegrated into crackingchar . The voice in Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swishing , sibilant swirl and the eyes in his mind saw four bright Catherine wheels perishingin glory . Wheels wheeled within the wheels and Cousin Katharine wheeled with them until the last page of her history was black ash .
