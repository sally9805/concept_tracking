The fly-tiers of my acquaintance are too numerous , muscular and , by their gifts , important to my fishing for me to express an opinion about them , but I will try to portray them by presenting just the facts . All do-it-yourselfers are , er , " different , " but fly-tiers are very different  --  away out in left field . Let me give you a fair example . // A few years ago I dropped in to see a friend who is a commercial photographer . He had a girl on the stand , and you will believe that she was a toothsome dish when I say that she was the highest-priced fashion model at that time and got , as I recall , $100 an hour . She was wearing a gorgeous fur coat , which was being brushed meticulously by the furrier who owned it so as to get the right play of light on it . ( Such props are borrowed , of course ; the owner takes the publicity for his pay. ) // Then entered a mutual friend who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely he stopped short and pointed like a bird dog , then bounded forward with a glad cry . // " Gee whiz ! " he cried , approximately . " What a gorgeous body .... " The model jerked her head around to slay another fresh guy with a dagger look , but the newcomer ignored her to fondle a corner of the coat while he finished his exclamation . " What a gorgeous body that would spin into ! " // You may be as puzzled as the model was unless I explain that a fly-tier often " spins " ( twists ) clipped fur around a sticky silk thread and then winds the furry thread in close turns on the shank of a fishhook to make a body for his imitation of an insect . // " What is it ? " he asked as he gazed at the glorious creamy , cinnamon-tinged fur . // " Fisher , " said the photographer . Then he indicated the coat with his thumb and added , " Only $12,000 , if you own a credit card . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gosh , I wish I could get just a little piece of it . " // " I can give you a few trimmings , " said the amused furrier. // " You can ? Oh boy ! Thanks ! " chortled the fly-tier , almost beside himself , and hastily hauled out his business card . // As we walked out together I remarked , " That girl is really a cupcake , is n't she ? " // " What girl ? " demanded the fly-tier vaguely . " Gee , I hope that guy remembers to send me those clippings . What a body ! " // NOTHING TO IT // This will give you an idea , although real fly-tiers whom I have known are far worse than that . And that is a curious thing , for there is really nothing to tying a fly . // Simply , the tier clamps the bend of a bare fishhook in a little vise so that he can work on the shank of it . He waxes a piece of fine silk thread  --  about one-quarter as thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it stiff so that it is easier to handle , and sticky so that it wo n't slip . He lashes one end to the hook with a few turns and then he winds that silk back and forth along the shank to the various points to which he attaches the parts of the fly ; the whole fly is tied together with that single strand . // At one point he ties on a couple of little slips of feather for wings ; at another he ties on a few long fibers of feather for the insect 's tails . Where the body is to begin he ties on a piece of colored wool yarn , or a narrow strip of gold or silver tinsel , or a piece of silk with fur twisted onto it until it resembles a miniature cat 's tail . Then he winds the silk ahead to the point where the body will end , winds the body material in close turns to that point and fastens it securely with the thread . // At the right place he ties in one end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then winds the feather around the " neck " of the fly like a ruff , so that the bristling fibers resemble the legs of an insect . ( He thinks so , anyway . ) Then he ties down the other end of the feather with his silk and finally winds on a lump of it to form the head of the insect . A hitch to secure it , and a drop of varnish , and he has an artificial fly for catching trout . // It 's a cinch ; any 5-year-old kid can tie a fly , and I have the evidence to prove it . The only real stunt is getting the materials , particularly hackles . The good ones come not from just any rooster but from certain tough old geezers which happen to have just the right color , stiffness and freedom from center web in their neck feathers , a mighty rare combination and , needless to say , even rarer to find in the only place where chicken carcasses occur in quantity  --  a poultry market . The right roosters seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any I ever go near anyway . // So why does n't someone raise the right kind of feathers for the market ? Well , friend , how are you on Mendel 's law , the fundamental law of the geneticist ? Because these characteristics I have mentioned are not dominant but recessive . If you mate a cock and a hen , both with feathers of just the right blue-gray ( the most desired but rarest color ) hue and springy , clean texture , you will get a bunch of black , white , green , purple , spotted , striped and ring-straked monstrosities , among which the unusable colors will have fine glassy-fibered hackles and conversely the usable ones will have soft , webby hackles useless for dry flies , which have to float on the tips of clean , stiff fibers . // A PECK OF ROOSTER TROUBLE // In case you have never raised roosters , know that there are other complications too . Good feathers come from cocks with a game strain , and if you do n't keep each one in a separate pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even let them see each other ; they 'd kill themselves trying to fight their way through the wire to get at the opposition . You have to be fond of music , too . When I stay overnight at the Darbees ( Harry and Elsie are the best pro tiers in the world , for my money ) , I get a rooster serenade that begins at 12:30 a.m. and runs right through sunrise . // However , there are a few really gone fly-tiers who raise hackles . You can get some from them with a revolver and a blackjack. // That 's a possibility , too , for a true fly-tier is quite fanatical . For some years during and after the last war a chap named Harlan Maynard taught fly tying to disabled veterans at Hal-loran General Hospital . This hard-fisted , hard-faced , hard-talking and soft-hearted Maine man had a magnetic personality , and his classes tied with a fanatical fervor which persisted after they had been discharged and sent home . He once showed me letters from two of his grateful graduates , the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I am back to tying . I want to get a dozen of each size of 20 patterns in time for the opening of the trout season . My wife gave birth to a boy yesterday , 9 pounds . I have picked up a very promising pointer pup and am training him , but most of the time I tie flies .... " // Wrote the other : " I sure miss the class and wish I were back tying with you . I am getting tools and materials to start again . My wife went out for the evening three days ago and has n't come back yet . Wait till she gets home . How are all the fellows in the class ? I have found a place with some good blue necks , and the price is right too .... " // But I think the most in fly-tiers was the chap who came into the smoking compartment of a Pullman sleeper one night when the late Walter Sill of the Anglers ' Club of New York was tying salmon flies to pass the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lightning ! " said the young man , which was not an exclamation but the name of the salmon fly Walter was tying . He sat down to talk , and in half an hour the porter came in. // " Your wife sent me to see where you were , suh , " he said . // " Tell her I 'll be right back , " said the young man . Half an hour later , while they were taking turns at the tying vise , the porter returned . He addressed our young man again . // " Your wife says to come back , suh , " he said . // " Right away , " said the young man , waxing another piece of thread and never looking up . // Half an hour and two salmon flies later the porter returned for the third time . // " Your wife says to come right away , suh , " he said . // " I guess I 'll have to leave you , " the young man said with an apologetic smile , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , we were married just this afternoon . " // He was a real fly-tier.
