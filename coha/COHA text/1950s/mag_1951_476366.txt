THE year in books was a mixed grill . As one who happens to like mixed grills , that seemed fine to this department . But authors , ? editors , publishers , critics , and booksellers had tremendously weighty things to say on what was wrong with the year . They glowered at the idiot 's jig of television . They deplored the high cost of literacy in every step of producing a book ? and then they discussed pocket editions with the air of Rolls-Royce fanciers watching the Fords go by . Talking to one another , they probably used up a million highball-hours and tons of paper that might as happily have gone to Ethel Waters ' His Eye Is on the Sparrow , Omar Bradley 's A Soldier 's Story , Rachel Carson 's The Sea Around Us , Jessamyn West 's The Witch Diggers , James Jones ' From Here to Eternity , The Collected Poems of William Butler Yeats , The Letters of Theodore Roosevelt , J. D. Salinger 's The Catcher in the Rye , William Faulkner 's Requiem for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story , Arthur Mizener 's The Far Side of Paradise , Nicholas Monsarrat 's The Cruel Sea , The Papers of Thomas Jefferson , The American Oxford Atlas , James B. Conant 's Science and Common Sense , Carson McCullers ' The Ballad of the Sad Cafe , and The Forrestal Diaries . For these were some of the books that showed what was right with the year . It was ? and , as we shall see , it still is ? quite a year . Winston Churchill 's new book , Closing the Ring ( Houghton Mifflin , $6 ) , the fifth in his majestic chronicle of Armageddon Part II , adds fresh fires to controversy and gives splendor to history . The theme of the volume , which runs like a planetary fox hunt from the spring of 1943 to the spring of 1944 , is the isolation of Nazi Germany , ready for the kill . In this volume you hear , for the first time , an undertone of plaintive fury beneath the rising thunder of victory . The Allies are winning everywhere , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the Battle of the Atlantic ( with Mr. Churchill as Triton ) , in Sicily , in Italy ( tougher going there ) . But in the councils of the Allies ( Quebec , Washington , Moscow , Cairo , Tehran ) the imperial voice of Britain is not growing any stronger , in spite of all that Mr. Churchill can , in spite of all he will , do . For this is a story of tremendous battles in the field ? and also around the green baize tables . The balances are changing , all over the earth . An awesome sight . Struggle for the World THE struggle for power it dramatizes is a struggle for the world of the future as well as the present and its clinging past . It runs through all the arguments over what to do about Poland , about Germany , about Japan ; about the Mediterranean , and the naming of one date and several commanders for the invasion of Normandy . Anyone who thinks the Soviet characteristic of grabbing appeared late in its table manners will be enlightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everything . When , as Mark Clark wryly said in Calculated Risk , the Prime Minister " had gotten back in the Mediterranean picture as a sort of super commander in chief , " masterminding luckless Anzio , he read Jane Austen 's Pride and Prejudice . Or , rather , since he was " at this pregnant moment on the broad of my back amid the ruins of ancient Carthage , " with pneumonia , his daughter , Sarah , read Miss Austen aloud . He endorsed the most perfectly written novel in the language : " What cairn , lives they had , those people ! No worries about the French Revolution , or the crashing struggle of the Napoleonic Wars . Only manners controlling natural passion so far as they could , together with cultured explanations of any mischances . " His Majesty 's First Minister .4 IPPERED back into his siren-suit in Lon- don , he fired memos , cables , letters , minutes , right and left , raising a welt here , a blister there . " Why must you write intensive ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Intense ' is the right word . You should read Fowler 's Modern English Usage on the use of the two words . " He wanted the Foreign Secretary to advance the legation status of Cuba to ambassadorial rank , praising this rich , large , beautiful island , the home of the cigar . " He won the retroactive gratitude of Americans stationed in London by asking why British landlords soaked them so brutally with high rents . He told General Ismay that " the difference between a Chief of Staff and a Commander in Chief in the field is more apparent than real . Both are office workers . " It took some amusingly avuncular letters from the King to keep him off a Royal Navy ship on D-Day . As for the chairborne officers who swarmed in Algiers , he thought it might be a good idea to form a Sacred Legion of them : " Let them set an example to the troops in leading some particularly desperate attack . " He knew all that was going on , everywhere . For example , in Hitler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schmidt , who spent a livid decade translating the Fuehrer 's shouts and mumbles , says that one of the most remarkable meetings he ever saw was between l3adoglio 's foreign minister and the Nazis , after the fall of Mussolini . But Mr. Churchill knew about that , too . The Badoglio people did not get anywhere with their recent friends . Or with anyone else , for that matter . They were expendable details in Mr. Churchill 's larger plans for the Mediterranean , which he liked to refer to as the Third Front . ON ALL fronts , at all times , our Allies were always apt to be calling for more and more and more production from America 's home front . That , truly , was the free world 's last frontier . Eliot Janeway 's graphic and hard-hitting survey of America 's economic mobilization in World War II , The Struggle for Survival ( Yale ) , shows under what astoundingly untranquil conditions we filled the staggering orders for global war . This book is one of the latest in the Chronicles of America series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , which now includes such volumes as The Era of Franklin D. Roosevelt by Denis W. Brogan , From Versailles to the New Deal by Harold U. Faulkner , The New Deal and World Affairs and The United States in a Chaotic World , both by the indomitable Mr. Nevins , and a sketchy but useful narrative of battles and leaders , War for the World , by Fletcher Pratt . Although these volumes have different prices , depending on the binding and general d ? cor , apparently ? $5 for the bookstore edition , $6 for the standard subscription edition , $2.50 for the textbook edition ? unlike theater seats , they all give you precisely the same view of the stage . The plays themselves , however , are not at all alike . Not even when they present the same historical characters . In fact , it 's sometimes a thought difficult to recognize the same figure , the same problem , from chronicle to chronicle as each bard sings his tune . Thus , at one moment , in one book , Eliot Janeway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sometimes sounds slightly like an economic Chesterton with a slipping clutch , will tell us that " Roosevelt 's normal way of organizing a Department was to split it right down the middle . " And at another moment , in another book , Denis Brogan , who often sounds like a gifted Fulbright Scholar on reverse lend-lease , tells us that " even the Administrative simplifications of the overlapping New Deal agencies that had been loudly called for had been mainly completed by 1941 . " Or do you suppose they really mean the same thing ? If so , it 's a new example of the incalculable power of fission . What Light ? What Way ? AT ANY rate , there is certainly variety in the new books that end the year . Give the people light , the man said , and they will find the way . But what light ? What way ? You take Senator Robert A. Taft 's A Foreign Policy for Americans ( Doubleday , $2 ) , and read it in the same week you read Richard H. Rovere and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the President ( Farrar , Straus 8 , - Young , $3.75 ) , a probing study of MacArthur , Truman , and the future of American foreign policy , and you will see more fission , more fireworks . " The confusions of Senator Taft , the ablest and most logical of the isolationist Senators , " Rovere and Schlesinger say , " provided a measure of the chaos into which isolationism had fallen as a philosophy . " But Taft , nailing one more challenge on Truman 's crowded door , sounding as if he had overheard the none too soft impeachment , and , not a bit confused , comes right back with : " Entirely apart from any immediate threat of military aggression against the United States , I have always favored an international organization to promote the peace of the world and therefore of the United States . " Let him who is without bromides cast the first clich ? about paying your money and taking your choice . Holiday Philosopher RAVIN EDMAN 'S Under Whatever I Sky ( Viking , $3 ) is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of modern man . These cheerful essays , first published in the American Scholar , touch lightly on all things ? beginning , inevitably , with the familiar essay saying that the familiar essay is due for the oxygen tent any minute now . They are all forays against provincialism , proving that no matter where we live , under whatever sky , we are all apt to have the same sort of parochial tricks of entertainment , boredom , or delight , the same fears and frets and fidgets . The publishers , Mr. Edman suggests , seem to know this very well . Their lists , he notes , " are crowded with predictions of evil things to come and helpful little volumes that promise to mature your mind , to bring peace to your soul , to lift up your heart , to civilize your manners , to relax your tensions , to ennoble your character , to force people to love you , to persuade you to love them . " All these yearnings , incidentally , arc examined in novels . Where will it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that will add to the mountains energetically surveyed in The Modern Novel in America 1900-1950 ( Regnery , $3 ) , by Frederick J. Hoffman . For I believe that the novel reflects the state of the world in all its reason and unreason more faithfully than any other form of writing . As Mr. Hoffman takes you on his lecture tours through the works of Mr. James and Mrs. Wharton , Frank Norris and Theodore Dreiser , Miss Cather and Miss Glasgow , Lewis , Fitzgerald , Hemingway , Dos Passos , Wolfe , Faulkner , and all their followers , you are aware again that they have had a fair share in painting the world 's portrait of America . O'Hara 's People O NCE it was true to say that John O'Hara 's work began at the precise point where the strong influences of Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway met . That idea has no particular significance any more . For Mr. O'Hara writes now in a completely American grain of his own , about a Dutch-streaked Pennsylvania countryside that he knows and uses as remorselessly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should say , loves as well . Of course he may drop it tomorrow , and return to New York 21 , N. Y. But his new novel , The farmers Hotel ( Random House , $2 ) , a short and brilliantly executed parable , shows that he is once again deep in the land of Appointment in Samara and The Doctor 's Son and A Rage to Live . Once more the Brooks ' Suit Gang and the Blue Jeans Set meet in fatal confrontations . During a few dramatic hours at a snowbound country inn they clash ( while the clowns in his universal hotel tumble ) openly or subtly in what seems to me to be O'Hara 's most deeply thought out book . What is new here is that both sides have learned something about noblesse oblige , and that there are now many more sides to O'Hara 's characters . His faultlessly synchronized Pickwick Sisters are a long way from the theatrical landscapes searchingly documented in Show Biz : From Vaude to Video ( Holt , $5 ) , by Abel Green and Joe Laurie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place in this hospitable and rambunctious chronicle of American entertainment . Mr. Laurie wears the service bars of a thousand shows , and Mr. Green is the editor of Variety , which is written in an idiom ( " Sticks Nix Hick Pix " ) as strict and austere as that of the New Criticism ( " velleity gives ambivalence to the autochthonous dichotomy of Kafka 's formulations " ) . No Moaning at the Bar PEAKING of formulations , the other evening I dusted and uncapped a vintage bottle of Coca Cola , decanted it carefully into snifter glass , and picked up The Hour ( Houghton Mifflin , $2.00 ) by the Chevalier Bernard DeVoto . Or , as the cover of the bound galleys happily said , Bernard De Veto , since he imperially vetoes practically every drink known to man and beast except very sound old whiskeys and very cold young dry martinis . As readers of these pages know , he has done more than any other liberator to reclaim gin from the bad name Hogarth gave it , and he does n't want it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , again . But The Hour does require some sort of conviviality , and in another excellent new book by a member of the club , Russell Lynes ' Guests , or How to Survive Hospitality ( Harper , $1.50 ) , we are told that " the cocktail party , as good a symbol of the informality of modern entertaining as any , is , in a sense , a display of social irresponsibility . " ( A Voice from the Easy Chair : " Who in hell wants to be socially responsible during The Hour ? " ) Not Mr. Lynes . He 's deputized T. S. Eliot to look after that while he observes snobs and other weak-ended pests . The Specter of the Ross MI-IE social responsibility of the I Nero Yorker is touched upon heavily by Dale Kramer , the biographer of Heywood Broun , in Ross
