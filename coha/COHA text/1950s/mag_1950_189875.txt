In Atlantic City this week , 3,000 U.S. public-utility men , members of the Edison Electric Institute , heard a prediction that sent their voltage up . In the next 20 years , estimated Elmer Lindseth , outgoing institute president , * the growing U.S. economy will require three times as much electric power as the industry 's present capacity . " That , " said Lindseth , " will mean raising $30 billion of capital . . . a sum equal to the total investment today in the nation 's iron and steel , automotive , petroleum and coal industries . " <P> Coming from anyone else , such a prophecy might well have made the institute 's hardheaded members blow a fuse in surprise . But as president of the $250 million Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. , bustling , ruddy-faced Elmer Lindseth , 48 , has made a habit of winning big bets on an expanding economy . <P> Crossed Wires . Five years ago , when many businessmen were preparing to cut their switches in expectation of a " reconversion " slump with mass unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom which would need an ever-expanding supply of power , and backed his bet with a $90 million expansion program for his own company . Then Lindseth went out after business . By offering advice on factory sites , suppliers and markets , he helped lure 536 new plants ( including $50 million in chemical plants alone ) to the five-county area that C.E.I. 's national ads call " the best location in the nation . " To supply the power . <P> <P> Lindseth increased C.E.I. 's capacity to 984,000 kilowatts , almost double its prewar level . Last week , just before he left Cleveland for the convention , Lindseth announced that C.E.I. would double its capacity again , with a new $100 million , 1,000,000-kilowatt installation , scheduled for completion after 1965 . <P> Dynamo . Elmer Lindseth calls himself " a beneficiary of the capitalist system . " The son of Swedish immigrants ( his father was a blacksmith ) , he won scholarships to Cleveland 's Case Institute of Technology and Ohio 's Miami University , later a teaching fellowship to Yale . He worked summers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , got a full-time job as a " junior tester " in 1926 . Within a year he became a production engineer , later moved up as an assistant to C.E.I. 's President Eben Crawford , stepped into his shoes ( and an $80,000 salary ) at Crawford 's death in 1945 . <P> As president of the Edison Institute , Lindseth has been a leader in the utility industry 's fight against encroachment of public power . Four years before C.E.I. was divorced from North American Co. under the Utility Holding Company Act 's " death sentence , " Cleveland 's Cyrus Eaton led a movement to bring C.E.I , under public ownership as a part of Cleveland 's existing municipal power plant . Lindseth helped drum up an opposition which united management , labor and newspapers on C.E.I. 's side . Private ownership won . But Lindseth is n't letting his guard down . Says he : " The cold war against freedom of enterprise here in America is being waged without letup . We ca n't afford to become complacent . " <P> <P> * The new president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Carolina Power &; Light Co.
