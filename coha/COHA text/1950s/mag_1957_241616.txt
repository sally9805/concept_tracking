By 1907 the citizens of Haverhill , Mass. had shrugged off the motion picture as a flickering freak . Then an enterprising young ( 22 ) junkman named Louis Burt Mayer came to town and laid out $600 as a down payment on a onetime burlesque house . Mayer hid the shoddy past of his theater with a coat of white paint , installed an organ , and dug up a religious film called From the Manger to the Cross . His opening was a socko success . The lines of ticket buyers taught L. B. Mayer a lesson he never forgot : Americans want simple , clean entertainment . <P> As he added theaters to his chain , Russian-born L. B. Mayer soon ran out of his kind of films . In 1918 he opened a studio to supply his own demands . Six years later , prodded by Theater Owner Marcus Loew , he merged his two companies with Producer Sam Goldwyn 's studios to form Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer . The ex-junkman confidently made himself production chief . With Irving Thalberg , his brilliant assistant ( and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mayer set about remaking the motion-picture industry . <P> The Star System . His success was dazzling . For three decades tough , cocksure L. B. Mayer was the most important man in Hollywood . He knew exactly what Americans wanted and he gave it to them , by ballyhooing unknown kids into superglamorous movie stars . He found Robert Taylor at Pomona College and Joan Crawford in a chorus line . His star system , soon copied by his competitors , developed Gilbert , Murray , Gable , Tracy , Garson , Garbo , Powell , Astaire and Turner , clustered them and others in such big-money films as Ben Hur , The Good Earth , Grand Hotel and Dinner at Eight . If need be , Mayer could alter his proclaimed moral standards to fit the freewheeling ' 20s and ' 30s , turned loose Gilbert and Garbo in some sizzling love scenes , and let Harlow 's neckline find its natural level . <P> Mayer 's contract with M-G-M gave him 10% of the studio 's profits . For seven years in the late ' 30s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation , in 1937 made $1,296,503 . Success never softened his muscle . Hollywood had it that at one time or another he used his fists tellingly on Charlie Chaplin , Walter Wanger and Sam Goldwyn . <P> Enter Senary ; Exit Mayer . But even Mayer turned out to be vulnerable . In 1948 he startled Hollywood by handing over production of M-G-M films to onetime Scriptwriter Dore Schary . The two soon clashed over the proper themes for the studio 's pictures . Finally the old man quit MGM , talked vaguely of again making pictures that " you can take your mother and children to see . " <P> He never did . Instead , he shrewdly multiplied his fortune by investments ( oil , real estate ) , spent hours avidly watching television . Last July , when he suddenly lost his oldtime pep , he dropped in at Stanford Lane Hospital in San Francisco for a checkup . The doctors first said it was anemia , then spotted leukemia . Mayer entered the U.C.L.A. Medical Center in September , had a series of blood transfusions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died . Close by his bedside was his television screen , the only other force that had changed Hollywood as much as he himself had . Headlined the Hollywood Reporter : MR . MOTION PICTURE IS GONE .
