The Communist masters of China are having trouble with the peasants . Those who must farm the land to feed the world 's most populous country do not seem to have got the idea at all . In fact , most of them suffer from " spontaneous tendencies toward capitalism . " Others , unable to see the logic of increasing output or wealth only to have to give it up to government confiscators , are now afflicted , say the propagandists , with the delusion that poverty is best . <P> Private party reports , filtered out through Hong Kong last week , told in the Communists ' own unintentionally candid words how things have been going wrong : " The production sentiment of the peasants . . . lacks stability , and their understanding of the new production relations ... is still obscure . " <P> As a prelude to their vaunted classless society , the Peking Reds have tried to put peasants into a set of strict classes : landlords , who own land but do not work it ; rich peasants , who own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves and hire others to help them ; middle peasants , who may own or rent as much land as the rich peasants , but work it entirely themselves ; poor peasants , who may own land , but do not own the tools or animals to work it ; hired peasants , who own nothing , work for others . <P> Land , houses and properties were taken from the upper classes , divided and parceled out to the lower . Then came the " mutual aid teams . " In 1952 the reports showed that the party 's cooperatives and aid program in Manchuria actually knocked production down . In 1953 the party shifted its ground , told Communist cadres to tone down " socialist education " and put production before all else . Result : production no better than 1952 . The Chinese Nationalists on Formosa count the peasants ' discontent among their greatest propaganda assets , are trying to nourish it with leaflets dropped from planes which cross to the mainland almost nightly ( see cut ) . <P> Why Bother ? In five years , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reds have succeeded in setting up only 14,000 cooperatives out of a targeted 800,000 for all China . Some of the reasons for the great lag , as told by a team of Communist inspectors reporting to their bosses from a small area in South China : <P> The middle and rich peasants are afraid to expose their wealth , fearing that somebody may come along to borrow from them without returning the loans- " like tigers borrowing pigs . " The report quoted Middle Peasant Ho Yao-hsiang : " Why bother to make production such a success ? It will be sufficient if you grow enough to keep yourself fed . Once you make a success of your production , your staircase will be leveled by the footsteps of visitors . " Others were afraid of being accused of exploitation . " Because Poor Peasant Kan Yao-ching once lent grain to Kan Yung-lin , the masses wanted to promote him as a landlord during the reinvestigation . He said : ' I really dare not lend out grain again .
