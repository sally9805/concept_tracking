txt An all-time record for landings by the.trawlermen of Cape Ann is expected here by the end of 1951 . The men who " shoot the trawl " for redfish and whiting and circle the seines ' round the wily mackerel will have landed at least 255,000,000 pounds of fish here during the year , if catches hold high for the next three weeks . This is an estimate of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service here and it means a banner year for this old port which has sent its fishing ships to sea now for well over 300 years . The previous record was in 1948 when a little more than 251,000,000 pounds were put ashore to be shipped to wholesale and retail Stores all over the country . Most of the huge catch this year will be in redfish , the pink colored species that was an unsought " nobody " of the sea until Gloucester dealers gave it a " home " among fish foods back in the mid 1930 's when they were seeking something to take the place of Gloucester 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of changing times in fish processing and merchandising . ' Ocean Perch ' Promoted In 1934 only a few thousand pounds of redfish were landed at Gloucester . Now most of the Diesel-powered draggers sailing past Cape Ann to the off-shore banks are on the hunt for the profitable redfish ' that has been promoted as " ocean perch " into a top place among seafoods favored on the dinner tables of the great American Midwest . So intensive has been the hunt for redfish that rich hauls no longer can be made in the Gulf of Maine and other nearby grounds . The bigger boats of the Gloucester fleet are going ever fartherfrom home to drag the bottom for redfish cargoes . During the past year vessels in the 100-foot class have been making long voyages down to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and even to the far distant grounds of Anticosti Island in the Gulf ' of St. Law-. rence .
