No man living knows more about children and how they grow than Arnold Lucius Gesell . Unlike Freud , who reconstructed the child 's development from the moldering memories of neurotic adults , Dr. Gesell ( pronounced gazelle ) went to the child . For 40 years , most of them spent at Yale University 's Clinic of Child Development , Dr. Gesell has poked the fists of newborn babies to see how they contracted , taken 300,000 feet of movies showing how more than 12,000 youngsters grew in skills and aptitudes from the cradle to the age of ten. * This week , in a slim volume called Infant Development ( Harper ; $3.50 ) , Dr. Gesell sums up what he has learned of life and growth . <P> To Dr. Gesell 's understanding and sympathetic eye , the baby picking up building blocks one after another and banging them on the table is not making useless noise but doing something essential to his learning and growth : " He is much too young to count by spoken words . But this one-by-one behavior is unquestionably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehension . The rudiments of geometry are contained in his ... arrangements of his building blocks . " <P> Dr. Gesell sees growth as an uninterrupted , continuous process from the moment of conception to old age ; even the sudden change from life in the womb to the world outside is , to Gesell , only an uncommonly striking and abrupt phase of this continuous development . And he includes mental growth along with physical growth . " It is probable , " he writes , " that all mental life has a motor basis and a motor origin . The non-mystical mind i.e. , the mind when not engaged in pure reverie must always take hold . Even in the rarefied realms of conceptual reasoning we speak of intellectual grasp . . . Thinking might be defined as a comprehension and manipulation of meanings . Accordingly , thought has its beginnings in infancy . " <P> His researches have gone far enough to convince Dr. Gesell that " there is a basic ground plan of growth peculiar to the species , and always a variation of that ground plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be learned : <P> " We shall not have the requisite self-knowledge to manage our culture until we make a more sedulous effort to understand the ways of all growth and the potentials of child growth , which are the . . . products of organic evolution . This evolution has not ceased , and to that degree man still remains educable . . . Among other things , he surely needs a science of behavior . . . which will not only probe the lingering wickedness of Old Adam , but will explore with unrelenting penetration the rich repository of potentials for good , which are revealed with awesome mystery in the sequences of child development . " <P> <P> *He has spelled out the stages of growth in two bestsellers ( written with Dr. Frances L. Ilg ) : Infant and Child in the Culture of Today and The Child from Five to Ten .
