T T Culver Military Academy , in Indiana , they tell , with some delight , the story of the startled father who did not know his own son . The sire , a man of considerable renown in the mov-ing-picture business , popped in one evening unex-pectedly , asked if he might pay a brief visit to his off-spring and was directed to the proper room in bar-racks . Hoping to give the boy a pleasant , surprise , he opened the door without knocking , poked his head in , stared a moment and then hastily withdrew , mum-bling an apology for entering the wrong room . In the hall , witnesses recall , he did a Hollywood-style double-take , went hack to the door for another look , and then announced in a voice that rang through the barracks that he would , in truth , be damned . Later , in conversation with Col. William E. Gregory , the superintendent of the academy , he explained his somewhat peculiar actions . When he looked in , he said , the first thing he noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had expected , an outsize copy of Fibber McGee 's closet . No clothes littered the floor , shoes were lined up under the bed in neat rows , glittering with polish , and there were no apple cores about . The second thing that befuddled him was the fact that the youngster at the desk in the corner was obviously studying with all his brain cells at once . The radio was there , but it was off , and the cadet poring over the textbook was not seeking to absorb Caesar 's dissertations on Omnis Gallia while 110 generations ago a male parent was likely to be an austere and aloof character , Olympian in his dignity , who demanded and received considerable deference from his young . No boy in his right mind would think of referring to him as " pop , " or of answering him with a diffident " Yep , " " Nope , " or " Okeydoke . " A newer generation of fathers , though , spurred on by the child psychologists , have to a great extent broken down the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their offspring . The idea has certain virtues , Culver feels , but it does not lack flaws . The man who chuckles amiably when his six-year-old son addresses him by his first name and ignores his sage advice is displeased and disturbed when the youngster does the same thing at the age of sixteen . He begins to suspect that perhaps he has overdone the palsy-walsy business . In the old days , Culver accomplished one of the basic missions laid down by its founder-that of disciplining the moral nature-by pressing the malleable spiritual metal into a military mold under a regimen that embodied the more rigid restraining features of West Point and a Trappist monastery . A new cadet did not walk or stroll . He marched in a military manner , turning square corners even while hastening to the lavatory in barracks . When he sat , he sat at attention . He spent long hours at drill , and he devoted much arduous toil to shining the forty-four large brass buttons on his dress uniform . When he finally came off the assembly line under this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon and the master of many manly accomplishments . He stood and walked erect , possessed great social poise , and treated older folk with courtesy and respect . He drilled in ranks with the precision of a toy soldier wound up by a spring , and he could command a squad , a platoon , a company or a battalion with aplomb . He was likely to be a magnificent horseman , a dashing polo player , a good skeet shot , an accomplished squash , tennis or golf player , and he could adroitly handle a sailboat in foul weather . February 11. 1950 " In my day , " recalls Elliott White Springs , World War I ace , author and textile manufacturer , " recitations and study periods were just means of thawing out cadets between drills . " By the late ' 20 's Culver 's trustees , many of whom themselves were products of the school 's rigid discipline and parade-ground pomp , were seized by the dark suspicion that there might be some flaws in the system . The product Culver was turning out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking in the cadet 's make-up , mainly above the ears . The school , after all , was not concerned with producing candidates for West Point and Annapolis , but was , presumably , preparing boys for any of the 1700 colleges and universities in the United States . Culver 's top graduates , attending Ivy League colleges , were finding themselves outpaced scholastically by erudite products of Andover , Exeter and Groton , who seemed in no way handicapped by the fact that they could not salute with the saber or name the component parts of a howitzer 's breechblock . Consequently , despite cries of alarm from some older alumni , who , having survived the system , feared that the school was being turned into a seminary for young ladies , the institution gradually began to de-emphasize the military , and lay greater stress upon book learning . Drill was cut to three hours a week , the minimum necessary to keep the academy up to its forty-year standard as a War Department honor school , and no longer did the garrison turn out to pass in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the campus . Classroom instructors kept their military titles , but swapped their uniforms for sack suits , tweed jackets and slacks . Tactical officers-stern military men who were responsible for discipline in barracks and the general good behavior of the cadet when not on the drill field or in class-were replaced by more mellow counselors , who , before they put a cadet on report , sought to find out whether homesickness , girl trouble , family squabbling at home or just plain orneriness was causing him to dope off . The new accent on scholarship had gratifying results . Culver first-class ( ( : ont ? . r1 from Page 110 ) men , or seniors , who once approached College Board Examinations with the fearful unwillingness of a man being led to the scaffold , and who emerged from these exams dazed and shaken , began to tear into the tests with gusto and come up with creditable marks . In recent years , for example , every graduating cadet has passed his College Boards , thus making himself , presumably , eligible for any higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual matters has naturally led Culver to do a considerable job of academic soul-searching , and the school frequently invites renowned educational technicians to come down and poke around through the curriculum , it in on classes and recommend new courses and teaching methods . Some of these suggestions the school takes . Many it rejects , for there seems to be a view prevailing among avant-garde educators that the best way to bring a teen-age boy to his fullest development is to let him follow his own bent , doing what he wants to do when he wants to do it . Culver , which has been dealing with teen-age boys for more than half a century , does not think this theory makes much sense . " We have observed , " one teacher said , " that the average teen-age boy , if left to his own devices , will do something he should n't be doing or do nothing at all . We get a great many youngsters here who have been allowed to express themselves through the first eight grades . Many of them have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of their first year teaching them to read and write . " Working on the reasonable assumption that colleges first of all want men soundly grounded in the three R 's , the school therefore has largely ignored recurring fads in secondary education and has kept its curriculum as simple as the course of studies offered by the Little Red Schoolhouse . It , bears down heavily on English , history , mathematics , science and languages , and a cadet must acquit himself well in these subjects before he is allowed to branch out into more cultural fields , such as music and art . There is plenty of opportunity for self-expression outside the classroom , though . A youngster may spend his spare time doing anything from modeling in clay to riding to hounds . The school slogan ? Culver Educates the Whole Boy  --  may inspire campus cartoonists to draw derisive caricatures of a cadet earnestly spining a top , but it is true . The rounding-out process , however , takes place outside the classroom . Despite the fact that many parents in recent years have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstreperous little varmints may be sent to have their felonious tendencies subd ued , Culver also feels that no better system than the military has yet been devised whereby democracy can be taught and the disciplines and the competitive drives of adult life can be simulated . So , though it has modified a plebe system which kept new cadets scurrying like frightened field mice at the command of upperclassmen , and has done away with much of the pomp and pageantry of the military ceremonies , except on festive occasions , when parents get a great thrill out of seeing their sons parade , the school has clung to a basic military concept . By the nature of its student body , it feels that it has had to . Its students , in the main , are the sons of hard-driving businessmen who had it tough in their own youth , worked hard , and made enough money to give their - families a far softer life than they themselves knew . They look to the school to impose on their sons the responsibilities and the disciplines that life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five o'clock in the morning to carry a paper route when I was a boy , " said one frustrated father . " I think it was good for me . But I 'd feel like a fool trying to make my son 4 do the same thing when the man next door was taking his boy to Canada on a fishing trip . " Many Culver students , also , are the sons of men and women of notable achievements in financial , professional or entertainment circles . Children of such exceptional parents may have a tendency to consider themselves exceptional , too , and to look upon the rules and restrictions they will encounter in the outside world as being applicable only to lesser folk . The military system takes care of that delusion neatly . " The minute they put on the uniform , it no longer matters how rich their father is or how famous he may be , " one counselor explained . " Their parents ca n't help . The multimillionaire 's son and the boy on a scholarship are just alike . Each is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all alike " policy prevails in barracks and on the drill field , but stops at the classroom door . Culver has long recognized the fact that boys of the same chronological age may be widely disparate in mental age and in the ability to learn . The sixteen-yearold with the fourteen-year-old LQ. , therefore , is put into classes which carry him along at a pace he can maintain without undue strain , with plenty of opportunity for special tutoring and extra study-hall sessions when the going gets tough . The especially bright and talented youngster gets an equal break . Instead of being required to drone along at half speed with the laggards , he can work for honors in special teaching sections which carry him far beyond the usual high-school stopping point in English , math , history and languages . In science he can leave the textbook experiments behind and venture into actual laboratory research . More of a challenge- to the school than either the striving dullard or the 114 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 11 , 1930 ( Continued fr6 6r Page 112 ) ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to care whether he learns anything  --  the type whose parents tell the registrar , " He 's smart , but he 's awfully lazy . " Culver does not recognize the word " lazy , " considering it to be meaningless . They prefer to say that a youngster is " unawakened " or " unstimulated , " and the whole school setup is geared to stimulate him . Mainly this is accomplished by applying the old Napoleonic theory that if you give a man a medal , he 'll give you his life . A cadet can win a set of little buttons to wear on his collar merely by holding his shoulders back , and for each new achievement , whether academic or military , he earns another wreath , lozenge , star , shield , diamond or arrowhead to wear on his collar , bosom or sleeve . As a result , a youngster who has acquitted himself with moderate distinction as scholar , soldier , athlete and all-round citizen goes home after graduation wearing more brass , braid , emblems , medals and ribbons than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such stimuli , of course , and for the overtly recalcitrant ones there is a system of punishments ranging in severity from heart-to-heart talks to dismissal for the cadet who is obviously wasting the school 's time and his parents ' money . " When we have to ship a cadet , " one teacher said , " it means , of course , that not only he but we have failed . A boy is like a piece of intricate machinery . He 'll run smoothly , if , only you can flint the proper button to push . We spend a lot of time and thought trying to find the button . " Now and then a cadet who seems to be running smoothly will suddenly take off for home , causing the school considerable embarrassment . To avoid this , the academy has set up a system of cadet personnel officers , who supplement the work of the faculty counselors . Old cadets of amiable disposition and mature judgment , their job is to keep an eye on the general state of morale in barracks . They comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad who finds it hard to keep pace with the fast-moving daily routine , and ease tensions which arise when roommates begin to get fed up with each other . The academy believes that cadet personnel officers discover and smooth out many troubled situations that might never come to the attention of the high brass until too late . One cadet personnel officer , for instance , took a hand in a situation the school itself would have hesitated to tackle . Worrying over the fact that his father and mother were on the verge of divorce , a top cadet went into a bad slump . The cadet personnel officer , acting on his own , got the folks back home to patch up their differences until after the boy had graduated . Another tactfully suggested to a doting mother that her son would adjust to the discipline more quickly if she would not visit him so often , smothering him with affection and sympathizing with him when he complained about having to shine his own shoes . The complex system of lures and pressures by which the school seeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students into a commendable , though conventional pattern , would , no doubt , have perplexed the academy 's founder , a man who himself was cast in a somewhat unconventional mold . Henry Harrison Culver was neither an educator nor a militarist . He was a stocky , bearded , laughter-loving salesman , with a lusty sense of humor and a fund of colorful stories , gathered in his years on the road , which he told with great zest , slapping his leg and roaring happily . A handsome old gentleman , bearing a strong resemblance to Robert E. Lee , he hated pomposity and was inclined to distrust individuals who wore tall beaver hats . When calling on bankers to float a loan for his business , he was careful to wear a venerable slouch hat and a coat that looked as if it had been slept in , and a hole in his pants did not distress him . He loved children , and on trains would take squalling babies from their mothers and dandle them on his knee until they shut up . Once on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he threatened to poke in the nosy an irascible traveler who complained about a child 's crying . He was particularly fond of boys , who followed him about like mice following the Pied Piper , and he was extremely tolerant of their foibles . He allowed his own youngsters to keep a bear cub for a pet , and once nonplused a minister who called to rebuke him for allowing the neighborhood kids to shoot craps in the basement of the Culver residence in St. Louis . Crap shooting was good for growing boys , he told the preacher . It taught them early , when they did n't have much to lose , that gambling was a foolish pakirne . In the course of a busy life that ended when he was fifty-seven  --  only three years after he had started the school  --  the elder Culver never had time to get more than the rudiments of a formal education . Born on a farm near London , Ohio , in the year that William Henry Harrison was elected President after the famous Log Cabin and Hard Cider campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join his older brothers peddling sadirons , clocks and , later , stoves , through the South and Middle West . He traveled by wagon , spending the night at farmhouses , where he would set up a stove and bake a batch of biscuits to demonstrate the virtues of the range . After some ten years of this wandering life , he made a selling expedition into the vicinity of Wolf Creek , Indiana , where he not only sold a stove to a prosperous farmer named Hand ; he sold himself to the farmer 's daughter , Emily Jane . Thereafter , for a number of years , Mr. and Mrs. Culver traveled together , pausing now and then to add a son or daughter to a growing family . Finally , the brothers , discovering that malleable iron made a far more durable stove than cast iron , quit the road and set up.their own manufacturing firm , the Wrought Iron Range Company , of St. Louis . Soon scores of salesmen , wearing derby hats , flowing mustaches , and riding in buggies , were extolling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkansas , startling the natives by throwing their sample stove off the back end of the buggy , opening the oven door and jumping on it , and banging the stove lids with hammers to demonstrate the durability of the new product . The new firm prospered , but ; unfortunately , as Mr. Culver 's wealth increased , his health declined . The next time he journeyed to the vicinity of his wife 's home he came as a sick man . Nearly dead of a heart ailment , he set up a tent on the shores of Lake Maxinkuckee , a twelve-square-mile stretch of clear blue water filling an old glacial depression in North Central Indiana , and lived there while his house was being built . A year in the open left him haleand vigorous again , a transformation which so delighted him that he felt a strong compulsion to advertise Lake Maxinkuckee 's salubrious qualities to the world . His first venture was a revival meeting . He built a tabernacle and a large hotel , or bunkhouse , and imported such noted pulpit thunderers as T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The venture was in one respect a great success . Twenty-five thousand people came in wagons , buggies , on horseback and by special train from Chicago and Indianapolis . Unfortunately , the eager seekers after spiritual guidance were thrifty folk , and since Mr. Culver had neglected to fence in his grounds , most of them managed to hear the high-priced preaching free . Unable to subsidize the spiritual uplifting of the entire Middle West , Culver quickly abandoned his religious enterprise and converted the plant into a fairground , complete with race track . To encourage the local farmers to improve their livestock , he paid $5000 for a bull , bought a hog , which his sons remember as being as big as a roll-top desk , and a magnificent curly-horned ram of testy disposition . The fair struggled feebly for a few years , the bull and the hog expired , and the ram , in a temperish moment , butted Mr. Culver with such violence that he thought he had been struck by a locomotive . Bruised in body and spirit , he gave up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to cast about for other means of perpetuating his family name and the fame of Lake Maxinkuckee . For reasons nobody has ever quite understood  --  other than the fact that he liked to have boys around him  --  he converted the old bunkhouse into a barracks and started a school . The venture at first seemed destined to be no more successful , financially than had the subsidized preaching and the fair . Of the first forty-five cadets a zealous commandant fired six for some minor infraction of the rules , unaware that Mr. Culver , in order that his new enterprise might appear to be thriving , was paying the tuition of most of the students himself . Culver fired the commandant and reinstated the boys . At the end of the first year , to the great delight of the cadets , who were about to take an examination on Scott 's Marmion , the barracks burned . Instead of giving up his costly venture then , as his stove-making brothers urged , he built a new and fireproof barracks that would house 100 boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri , the original Missouri Military Academy , headed by a distinguished old Greek scholar and Confederate soldier named Alexander Frederick Fleet , went up in flames . Mr. Culver , with a handful of cadets rattling 116 TILE SATURDAY EVENING l ' ? ST February 11 , 1950 around in his big new building , immediately fired a fast telegram to Colonel Fleet . " Let 's get together , " he invited . They did , with an impact which jarred the spines of the original Culverites . Fleet 's homeless Missourians arrived by train , marched to the barracks , seized the inhabitants already there , wrapped them in mattresses and tossed them out the windows . Then they ripped open the fine feather pillows Mr. Culver had provided for their comfort and scattered wind-blown goose feathers over the cornfields for twenty miles around . No harsh hand of discipline fell , for it was the kind of exuberant prank Mr. Culver could easily forgive in the fine glow of suddenly acquiring a going educational concern . By the time of Mr. Culver 's death in 1897 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his commandant , Capt . John Quincy Adams , who had been Sherman 's signal officer on the March to the Sea , had the school well in hand and running under a tight rein . In a few years it was on such solid ground that it felt it could afford to fire outright 102 of its corps of 205 for leaving the grounds without permission . The move at first seemed disastrous , for the parents of the boys who had been kicked out roared with rage . The nation 's press , though , broke out in a rash of editorials praising a school which had the courage to dismiss half its student body for a breach of discipline , and the " Big Fire " turned out to be the finest kind of publicity for the young academy . As the winter school grew , prospered and attracted increasing public attention through the exploits of its famed Black Horse Troop of cavalry , which was always available for the escorting of bigwigs in parades , B. B. and E. R. Culver , sons of the founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not had time to put into effect before he died . First they started the Summer Naval School , to the derisive laughter of the editor of the newspaper in nearby Logansport , Indiana , who looked with hilarity upon the thought of training sailors on a Midwestern lake . Not long afterward the editor was making honorable amends . The Eel and Wabash rivers had inundated Logansport , and 1300 citizens of the town had been rescued from their rooftop perches by Culver cadets manning cutters . Soon after , to keep the horses earning their oats , the Summer Cavalry School was begun , and paralleling the birth of the Boy Scout movement in this country , the Culvers brought in Dan Beard to start the Summer Woodcraft Camp , a joyous gambol where small fry from ten to fourteen years old learned the rudiments of military drill , developed their muscles in athletic games , studied birds , trees and flowers , and danced around campfires at night , uttering war whoops . For two decades the academy , scuffling to make a place for itself in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by whatever means it could devise . Under Brig . Gen. L. R. Gignilliat , a superintendent with a showman 's flair , magnificent pageants flowered each spring along the lake banks , luring throngs . At presidential inaugurals and at civic celebrations through the Middle West , the Black Horse Troop and the Lancers awed the populace with the colorful maneuvers of the mounted drill . The picture of a Culver cadet performing intricate equestrian gyrations became as familiar to the readers of the London Graphic and Paris L'Illustration as it was to the readers of the United States Sunday supplements . Celebrities , from Madame Schumann-Heink to Will Rogers , thronged to the school to be honored with a battalion review , though Rogers professed to be less impressed by the military pomp than by the fact that teen-age boys were expected to learn to spell " Maxinkuckee " and pronounce " Gignilliat . " While the academy staff was out in front , holding the parades and taking the bows , the Culvers themselves were working quietly behind the scenes , pumping money into the school for projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , with stables for 136 horses and a mammoth recreation building , housing facilities for sixteen sports plus a 120-foot swimming pool and the world 's biggest indoor rifle range . They laid out a golf course , set up one of the first radio broadcasting stations and built a memorial library modeled after an English castle of the fifteenth century , which contained quarters where any alumnus with a nostalgic yen could come and stay indefinitely , eating at the mess hall , playing golf , sailing boats and taking the waters as a guest of the school . When finally they had rimmed the lake shore with a physical plant of thirty-six buildings worth nearly $5 , - 000,000 , they transferred the whole enterprise as a free gift , without strings and in perpetuity , to a trust foundation . " Buildings , land and all the cash in the bank , " said B. B. Culver . " We let the tail go with the hide . " While the Culvers owned and ran the academy as a private , though nonprofit corporation , they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a drinking fountain from a graduating class , and the school was forbidden to put the bite on alumni for contributions . Under the foundation , the " no-soliciting " rule still holds , but voluntary gifts will be accepted . The first gift building has already been erected by retired Capitalist Ross Beason as a memorial to his aviator son , Ross , Jr. , one of the 283 Culver men killed in the last war . Now that the no-gift rule is off alumni , whose affection for the school sometimes startles graduates of other secondary schools , have joined with the Culver fathers ' association to raise $1,000,000 for a new chapel . Some classrooms are still scattered in the basements of the barracks , but plans are on the drawing boards for a quadrangle of classroom buildings which will relieve this somewhat embarrassing situation . Along with its building program , the school is filling some chinks in its academic armor . Knowing that the $1450-a-year fee for tuition , room and board restricts its enrollment to the sons of the well to do , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford such an impost , both the Culvers and the alumni have set up scholarship funds " to grubstake , " as B. B. Culver puts it , " the best boys we can find . " While trying to get a handful of the best , no matter how poor , the school is now avoiding the worst , no matter how rich . Enrollment has leveled off at 650 , giving the school a better chance to pick and choose , and applications are politely rejected when alumni investigators report that the boy is an incipient hellion whose parents are at their wit 's end , discipline-wise . Realizing that in the last analysis the school will stand or fall not on the beauty of its 1000-acre campus or the spectacular riding of its horsemen , but on the record its graduates make in college and in later life , the academy in recent years has been working out a system of individualized guidance which seeks to analyze each boy 's aptitudes and capabilities and develop them to the fullest . Sometimes , in seeking to find the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies in directions other than those his folks had hoped he 'd follow . This may cause some pain back home , particularly if his father had set his heart on having the youngster join him in the family business . But it is all forgotten  --  at least for a moment  --  on graduation day. - When the youngster steps through the Iron Gate with his diploma in his hand and all his medals and ribbons shining on his chest , his old man stands there waiting with his eyes tingling and a lump in his throat , feeling the kind of high exultant pride that Christopher Morley felt when he wrote : There ' is no prince or prelate I envy  --  no not one . No evil can befall me  --  by God , I have a son !
