Britain 's womb-to-tomb National Health Service is in the red again . Last week Chancellor of the Exchequer Derick Heath-coat-Amory gave Commons the bad news : individual contributions will be upped , on July i , as much as 37% . <P> Before the N.H.S . was launched in 1948 , optimists estimated that it would cost $490 million a year ; of this , $355 million would come from general tax funds , the balance from individual contributions of up to about 20 a week . But the estimates proved woefully low . <P> Total costs have rocketed to an estimated $2 billion for the next fiscal year . To raise even one-fifth of this whopping bill ( four-fifths will still come from taxes ) , the Chancellor set these new weekly rates : for employed men , 7 more , for a total of 26 ; employed women , 5more , total 19 ; employed juveniles ( under 18 ) , 2 more , total 12 . In addition , employers ' fees will go up from 4 per worker to 6 . For children not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total of 16 . <P> The Socialists promptly blasted the government for laying the added burden on the whole population , meaning that most of it would be borne by the well . Deliberately so , said Heathcoat-Amory : the government believed this was fairer than putting a still heavier burden on the sick , who are least able to bear it .
