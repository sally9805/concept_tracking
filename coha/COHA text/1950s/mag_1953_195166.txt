Most publishers do not allow their books to come out in cheap paperback reprints until sales in hard covers have petered out . Last week they were beginning to wonder if they had been wrong . They noted that the deal by which Houghton Mifflin and Ballantine Books published Cameron Hawley 's Executive Suite ( TIME , Dec. 8 ) simultaneously in $3 hard-cover and 35 paperback editions seemed to be a solid success . Ballantine , which has sold 375,000 copies in soft covers , is getting ready to print at least 100,000 more , a big sale for a paperback . Houghton Mifflin has already sold 20,500 hardback copies ( v. an average sale of under 10,000 for most novels ) , and Executive Suite is still on the bestseller lists . Instead of hurting hardback sales , the cheap edition seems to have helped by giving the book more publicity . Houghton Mifflin has brought out four other titles the same way .
