txt President Syngman Rhee has sharply reversed his position on the question of an election under which Korea might be unified , and in so doing has greatly strengthened the negotiating position of the United Nations . He had previously held that , since his Government was the legally constituted and recognized one for Korea , all that was necessary was for the North Koreans to fill the vacant Assembly seats that had been reserved for them . He says now that he will not oppose a plan for a new nationwide election , North and South , that might choose himself or any other person for the Presidency , provided only the choice is free . This statement does not alter some of the hard facts in the case . It is still to be determined if the Communists ? Russian , Chinese and Korean  --  have any intention of permitting the unification of Korea on any terms whatever . The cynical , therefore , may say , that President Rhee is on safe ground . Most persons familiar with the Korean scene would say also that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since there is little doubt that in a free election he would be returned overwhelmingly . To his countrymen he remains the first Korean . But when these discounts are fully recognized , the fact remains that President Rhee has made , not a personal concession , but a great contribution to the cause we have espoused . The United Nations has repeatedly affirmed that its objective is a free , united and democratic Korea . The opponents of the United Nations  --  and of Dr. Rhee  --  have repeatedly asserted that what was ahead was a sinister movement to perpetuate a " dictatorship " with the military support of the United States and to extend it to an unwilling North Korea . That this allegation was demonstrably false has not made it less effective in some quarters in vilifying the United States , Dr. Rhee and the United Nations ' aims for Korea . Dr. Rhee 's statement should clear out some of this underbrush and broaden the path to settlement , at least as far as the United Nations is concerned . If unification proposals , including that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be obliged to face the retort that Dr. Rhee and his Government would not permit such a course . There does not , therefore , need to be the insidious suggestion that the United Nations would be obliged to negotiate with the Communists on the one hand and with Dr. Rhee on the other . This should not imply that the United Nations has a moral right to make decisions for the Koreans without even the courtesy of consulting them . It does imply that it will be far easier to reach a ground of full agreement with the Korean Republic than has sometimes been supposed , and even declared . More than that , Dr. Rhee has put the emphasis precisely where it should be placed . A unified Korea is important and it is Dr. Rhee 's constant goal . But it is no less imperative that this united Korea be free and democratic also . In stressing the criterion of free choice and his complete willingness to abide by it the Korean President has strongly reaffirmed the philosophy and the ideals of the free world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
