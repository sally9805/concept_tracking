Buick has jolted along a rough road in the last few years . After banner 1955 , when it sold 737,879 cars and held third place , Buick skidded steadily to 263,890 sales and fifth place last year . Trying desperately to arrest this slump , Buick Boss Edward Tillottson Ragsdale , 61 , radically remodeled the 1959 Buick . But in this year 's first quarter , when all other General Motors models rode up , Buick sunk to seventh place as sales slipped another 11% , and its market share dipped from 6.6% to 4.9% . <P> Word went round Detroit that G.M. was ready to scrap well-liked Ed Ragsdale . Finding a replacement was not easy : few of G.M. 's success-conscious comers wanted to take on Buick 's woes . One G.M. veep , so the story went , was offered Ragsdale 's job , nervously said no : " This is a promotion I do n't deserve . Ca n't you please find somebody else to reward ? " <P> Last week Ed Ragsdale announced his retirement . G.M. handed his job to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radiator Division at Lockport , N.Y . Like Ragsdale , Engineer Rollert moved up via manufacturing instead of sales . He joined G.M. out of Purdue ( ' 33 ) , rose in the AC Spark Plug Division as metallurgist , chief tool-and-die designer , assistant works manager . During the Korean war he managed the Kansas City , Kans. , Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac plant , made his mark by converting it into G.M. 's first dual-purpose plant , turning out cars and F-84F Thunderstreak jet fighters at the same time . For his good work , he was made chief of Harrison in 1955 . <P> Rollert , who likes to play chess or golf in his spare time , is faced with a real puzzler in Buick . No one knows why the ' 59 Buick has done poorly . Automen guess that it is too radically styled , too low and hard to get into , has a cramped back seat . In any case , Rollert starts with one big advantage over Ragsdale . Ed Ragsdale took over when Buick was at its peak . Ed Rollert 's Buick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
