Doctors disagree sharply on the value of vaccination against tuberculosis with BCG , the Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin ( TIME , Sept. 23 ) . Nearest approach to a consensus is that BCG is not to be recommended for people enjoying high standards of sanitation and health , but may be good for those with low resistance , living in overcrowded conditions , and those exposed to TB victims . Now the results of a long-term experiment show how effective the vaccine can be . In the Archives of Internal Medicine , three University of Pennsylvania researchers report striking benefits among American Indians who got BCG as children . Of 3,000 youngsters in the study , half were vaccinated in the 1930s , while the others ( from the same families and tribes , identical in all other ways ) were left unvaccinated for comparison . Checked 20 years later , the unvaccinated were found to have had more than five times as many deaths from TB as the vaccinated-68 as against 13.               @ @ @ @ @ @
