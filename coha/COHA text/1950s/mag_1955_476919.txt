AN UNEXPECTED characteristic of the eight lectures by J. Robert Oppenheimer collected in The Open Mind ( Simon and Schuster , $2.75 ) is their preoccupation with style . Oppenheimer does not use the word style in a primarily literary sense , though the care with which the lectures are written shows that he is by no means indifferent to style in language . But he gives the word a much broader meaning . He speaks , for instance , of the style of a science , and ? more surprisingly , perhaps ? he refers to Grant 's permitting the Confederate troops at Appomattox to keep their horses as an example of style . As the old saying has it , a man has to draw the line somewhere . The line he draws is his style . It is in this sense that the style is the man ; it is his definition of himself . In a remarkable passage Oppenheimer describes the kind of style he admires . It consists of drawing the line in such a way that justice is done to ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It " complements affirmation with limitation and humility " ; it makes action effective without being absolute ; above all it is the way " power defers to reason . " Presumably Grant 's style at Appomattox , in Oppenheimer 's eyes , lay not merely in permitting the troops to keep their horses but in adding that they would need them for the spring plowing . There Grant beautifully deferred partisan power to common humanity . The Open Mind is primarily concerned with the relation between the style of science and society as a whole , though several of the lectures deal with the relation between society and specific results of scientific research , atomic weapons . The scientist 's life , as Oppenheimer sees it , is a life of action ; science is a form of action , " a search for order and regularity in those domains of experience that have proven accessible to it . " Though the way of carrying on that search varies from one science to another , their styles have certain characteristics in common : they are nut authoritarian ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this style has great beauty , and he regrets that so few people participate in it . Science , he thinks , is no longer a part of the general culture as it was in the days of Jefferson and Franklin , with the result that many are deprived of its beauty and enlightenment . Nor is Oppenheimer hopeful that the style of science can be shared more widely , either through popularization or formal education . He argues with great cogency against President Conant 's position on the scientific education of nonscientists ; he maintains that repetition of standard experiments in a school laboratory is simply going through the motions , and by going through the motions of science a student will never learn the style of science , will never share in the life of action that is the scientist 's . Can the style of science be of help to us in dealing with other problems ? political problems , for example ? Oppenheimer doubts it . In human affairs one condition essential to the style of science is lacking ? the opportunity to verify results by repetition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once they are made things are different . And one important condition is added ? the problem of right and wrong . Though science has extended the range of moral questions and altered the form in which they are posed , it can not , Oppenheimer thinks , answer them , because it is always focused on a very small area of experience and takes the rest for granted ; it is ' ' profoundly unmetaphysical . " The style of science must defer to only one imponderable , the unknown ; but when we draw the line in human affairs we have to hear in mind not only what we do not know but also what we do not want or approve . At bottom Oppenheimer is troubled that science must be amoral and a scientist dare not be . The style of science can not be the man of science , because too little is taken into account by the line science draws . Since , as the stories of Adam and Prometheus remind us , this problem is as old as human consciousness , it is not surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Open Mind the attentive reader has an opportunity to see the problem explored by an extraordinarily cultivated , lucid , daring , and humane mind . HARRY S. TRUMAN calls his account of his first year as President The Year of Decisions ( Doubleday , $5 ) , and a highly appropriate title it is . Surely few men have had to make so many decisions , or decisions of such magnitude , in so short a time . In three months the new President had to deal with the San Francisco Conference , the surrender of Germany , the Potsdam Conference , the beginnings of the atomic age , and the surrender of Japan ? all while /earning a job for which he had not been briefed and carrying on a heavy schedule of routine administrative work . To have come through that alive is something to be proud of , and Truman is proud of it . Whatever else may be commonplace in Truman 's make-up , his hook shows that he has a most uncommon ability to make decisions and not let the consequences gnaw at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirking responsibility . He never whines . I believe that only twice in all these 596 pages does he say he did the wrong thing . Once , in the long autobiographical digression that recounts his life before the Presidency , he says he was wrong as Senator in voting for the Neutrality Act ; again , toward the end of his first year as President he made a mistake , he says , in telling a press conference that he approved a speech Henry was about to deliver when he meant to that he knew Wallace was to speak . Where did Truman get the stamina to make and survive so many decisions ? For one thing , Truman came to the Presidency perfectly familiar with what Oppenheimer would call the style of politics ; he loved it and he respected it . For a generation taught in " civics " courses that the object of governmental organization is to make politics nonpolitical , Truman the politician has always been a little hard to accept ; but for Truman it is as clearly self-evident that a man in politics ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be a dentist . Almost as soon as he became President , for instance , he began to think about replacing Stettinius as Secretary of State , because Stettinius stood next in line for the Presidency and he had never held an elective office . He was not a politician and therefore unfit to be President . ( Obviously there may well have been other considerations involved that Truman does not see fit to record , but it is significant that he does see fit to record that consideration , and that the order of Presidential succession was changed within his first year inoffice . ) And Truman 's reasons for thinking of Byrnes for Stettinius ' post were overwhelmingly political ? Byrnes had hoped to be Roosevelt 's running-mate in 1944 and had asked Truman to nominate him , and Byrnes ' service to party and country ( in that order ) merited recognition . There is no mention of Byrnes ' knowledge of foreign affairs . Repeatedly in speaking of the qualifications of a man he appointed to office Truman emphasizes that the man had political experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truman writes , " because a man who understands politics understands free government . Our government is by the consent of the people , and you have to convince a majority of the people that what you are trying to do is right and in their interest , If you are not a politician , you can not do it . " But a man who has mastered the style of politics has more than his powers of persuasion to fall back . on in making decisions . He has learned to see the issues and he has acquired some sense of what Oppenheimer calls " the implicit , the imponderable , and the unknown " in them . For another thing , Truman believes , like Oppenheimer , that political decisions are moral decisions ; they concern what people want and approve . But Truman 's is not a speculative mind . For him the fact that political decisions are moral rather than , say , scientific makes them easier , not more difficult , because morality is in the public domain ? all men are moral beings but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He says that given the facts reasonable men will usually agree about what ought to be done . Truman 's praise for other men is almost always in moral terms . He says of Henry L. Stimson , whom he greatly admired , that he was honest and just and had a gift for plain language . The detractors of Stimson , who like to see him as a fox-hunting snob , will not be pleased by the reference to the gift for plain language , but it is characteristic of Truman that he would praise a gift for putting the issues in the public domain . The praise of George VI is typical : he was good and well-informed and had great common sense . Yet for all his emphasis on moral qualities , Truman does not care for moralizing . Repeatedly at Potsdam he became " very impatient " with Churchill 's long-winded and lofty discourses . He says he liked Churchill at once , but it is clear that he liked him best when there was an ocean between them . On the other hand Stalin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' ' he quickly reduced all questions to problems of power . " On the rare occasions when Truman mentions intellectual attainment he shows little enthusiasm ; his reference to " the famous and brilliant Dr. Albert Einstein " is somehow cold and distant and as if he thought the reader might not know who Einstein was . Yet Truman has great respect for information , and he is probably a better-educated man than has generally been supposed . He thinks of himself as a bookish man . When he was a little boy first fitted with glasses he was told that he would have to be careful not to break them ; consequently , lie says , he played less and read more than most boys . He was not overwhelmed when he saw the mass of documents lie would have to get through every day as President , because he " had always been a reader . " Mostly he has read history . He has read it not as a scholar but as a practical man and a politician and a moralist ? to see what men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular situations , and there is no doubt that he thinks of history as of great help to him in making his own decisions . His procedure in setting up what came to be known as the Truman Committee of the Senate during the second world war is typical : first he established the simple principles on which the committee was to operate , next he picked the men to help him , and then he sat down to read the records of a committee that had failed at a similar task during the Civil War . ABOVE all one is struck by the extent to which Truman has taken his own measure . When he first saw the ravages of Hitler 's Germany on the way to Potsdam he said to himself , " That is what happens when a man overreaches himself . " Truman was free to make decisions because he knew who he was and had accepted that knowledge : all his tremendous energy was directed outward because it was not worn away in quarreling with himself . There is nothing messianic about the man : for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his conviction that most of the time he has done it , he has little self-righteousness ; he is a man who , in the old-fashioned slang phrase , does n't expect to get anything on his looks . There is a clear distinction in his mind between a man named Harry S. Truman and the office of President of the United States . Where Truman 's self-acceptance came front it is impossible to say , but there is a curious gap in his life that invites speculation . From shortly after his graduation from high school until the first world war , according to his own account , he simply staved at home OH the farm . He says very little about what he did or thought or expected of himself during that long stretch of time between youth and maturity . Apparently he accumulated some capital , which he lost in the haberdashery business after the war ; apparently lie continued to go with the girl he had loved since high school but did not marry until after the war ; the rest is vague . Surely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to work on his father 's farm for more than a decade . Perhaps it was one of those fallow periods that often appear in the lives of men eminent in American politics . Possibly a late and slow growth to maturity and a sustained experience of the daily round of ordinary life often go into the formation of the political style in a democracy . At any rate the first world war put an end to that . The war meant a lot to Truman and still does . On his Potsdam trip he was proud to see his old " outfit , " and he found certain military developments " very interesting to an artillery mar . " His warm advocacy of universal military training comes from his sense of what military service meant to him . For the first time in his life he saw the world far from Missouri , and it changed him . He left home a farm bachelor and returned to become a married businessman in town . In the long run the wartime policy of Woodrow Wilson had a decisive influence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much to him at the time . Nor is there evidence that Truman was greatly interested in foreign affairs even as late as his service in the Senate . His corn . niittee work there was concentrated on domestic issues . But in his ac. count of the Presidency , Truman makes it clear that he regarded foreign policy as an extension of Wil son 's . Repeatedly he cites Wilson 01 employs his phrases . Only one criti cism of Wilson appears : he failed to carry the Senate with hint . But Tru man adopted Wilson 's policy with out assuming Wilson 's role ; the po litical style he had mastered was corn pletely unsuitable for that and he had enough sense to know it . He appreciated Stalin 's shrewdness and jokes and clear-headedness more than Wilson would have , and he probably sized up Stalin better . IN HIS acknowledgements Truman pays tribute to the men who have helped him write the book , but a good deal of it bears the unmistakable stamp of his own hand . He is not much of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has none of the tension that comes with introspection and self-doubt and brooding ? over things , but fortunately he does not try for literary effects . Many of the letters and speeches that form a large part of the book have only a documentary interest , though that interest is of course often very great . Truman 's account of how his speeches were written makes one wonder that they are not worse . He wanted them to be thoroughly responsible public statements , and to make them that they went through a mill which would make the ordinary committee report look like the product of a flash of inspiration . The best piece of writing in the book is an angry letter about John L. Lewis . When Truman lost his temper , as the world knows , he could write a racy , vividly idiomatic language which reminds us that he came from the same state as Mark Twain . But most of The Yeas of Decisions is recollected in tranquillity . He has not allowed his later differences to color his initial estimates of men he worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his mother and sister that Eisenhower was " a real man " ) , and accounts of his fights are usually good-tempered , though Truman regularly wins . The career of Harry S. Truman will always be debated by students of democratic government , because it is in a sense a test case of that kind of government . It will be argued that Truman was simply the ward-heeler who held the lucky lottery ticket , aid it will be argued that democracy has some kind of built-in mystique whereby those who are called to power are made worthy of it . On the evidence of this first volume of the Truman memoirs , both views are wrong and the truth does not lie somewhere in between . Truman came to the Presidency with no recondite gifts , to be sure ; he had no power that ordinary men do not have in some measure . But he was extraordinarily endowed with ordinary powers , and he had combined those powers in a personality of uncommon effectiveness . THE FAILURE OF STYLE 0 N C E I had a punch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel , The Deer Park ( Putnam , $4 ) . " . . . But they say that sometimes a fighter is dangerous when all that 's left is his instinct sort of , because he ca n't think his fight any more . " That is a fair sample of Mailer 's language , and ? after certain ' corrections have been made ? a fair description of his book . Mailer ca n't , or wo n't , think his novel any more , but when a novelist tries to get along by instinct sort of , he is not dangerous ; he is only dull . The book is iticompetent in almost every way . Sometimes the words fail to make sense , Mailer writes of one character , for instance , that he " could talk openly about his personal life while remaining a dream of espionage in his business operations . " This is the failure of style at its most elementary level . The novel 's very plan ( to use words loosely ) is absurd . It is written in the first person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the scenes he describes and the nature of the scenes is such that ( one hopes ) they would n't have occurred if he had been there . In the earlier chapters Mailer clumsily explains how the narrator knows these things ; later he just gives up . The whole concluding section of the novel takes place when the narrator is 3,000 miles away from the action and after he has taken leave of the characters for the last time . This kind of botch is not new in American writing . Sherwood Anderson spoiled some otherwise good stories in the saute way , though not so outrageously . It results from the failure of style at the highest level : a lack of confidence in what you are doing . Because a writer lacks confidence in the authority of the imagination ( the only authority a novel has ) , he attempts to give his work the authority of reporting , by using a first-person narrator who can tell us JOHN GUN'THER 'S Inside Africa ( Harper , $6 ) is an enthralling hook . The subject is infinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book . Gunther has been systematically gathering material on Africa for a quarter-century . He has been out there five times . His last trip , in 1952-53 , covered many months and 40,000 miles , and lie met and talked with everybody of any importance except for a few Moslem sultanas in ' purdah . Through it all Gunther has maintained his journalistic aplomb . He preserves his gift for striking comparison . ( Most of Africa south of the Sahara is perfectly safe for travelers , he says , but a few parts are as dangerous as Central Park at night . ) He has an endless supply of colorful de1 tails . ( The Fulani of Nigeria are a slender people but they admire fat women ; the emirs used to line up candidates for concubinage with their noses against the wall , and those commodiously cantilevered* tapped for the harem . ) He * Cantilever : a projecting beam . . . ( Webster 's ) . THE NEW BOOKS knows a good story when he hears one . ( A South African passenger on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Negro holding so dignified a job as steward , and he addressed hint contemptuously as " Boy . " The steward replied politely , " Am not boy , sir . Am air hostess . " ) And he even leaves ? alter 900 pages ? curiosity unsatisfied . ( He tells us that the people of the Gold Coast a few years ago chanted " Kwame Nkrumah 's body lies amold'ring in the jail " to the tune of " John Brown 's Body , " but he does not tell us how they got in all the syllables . ) Occasionally ? very occasionally ? Gunther gets a bit grand ( " I have always , " he writes , " had difficulty in talking to Arab potentates " ) and he is too fond of certain words ( especially formidable and indeed ) , but on the whole the book is a remarkable accomplishment . In fact it is very formidable indeed . To generalize from this wealth is to tell the reader what he knows al-ready ? that Africa is a collection of countries in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For some tribes it means jumping from the stone age to the present in a few decades ; for some countries ? the Moslem countries and Ethiopia ? it means jumping from feudalism to modern times . For the Gold Coast it means a delicate experiment in freedom ; for Liberia it means making a government out of a permanent minstrel show . Gunther does not often go beyond description to prescribe for Africa , but when he does he is not always convincing . The crying need of the continent as he sees it is education , but education in a society where there is no place for the educated is not always salubrious. join ? Kenyatta , the leader of the Mau Mans in Kenya , studied at the London School of Economics ; there are more and better universities in South Africa than in any other African country . This is not to say that Africa does not need education , but a new social structure and the people to make it work have to be developed more or less simultaneously . But no one should or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book that instructs at the same time it restores the sense of wonder : the world is a stranger and THE NEW BOOKS snore various place than we had remembered . ( Incidentally , the prospective reader would be well advised to get himself a good map . The maps provided are handsome but inadequate . ) AN U NU SUAL opportunity to see what one kind of African etic-a-1 tion looks like is provided by Albert Memmi 's novel The Pillar of Salt ( Criterion , $3.75 ) . This is the story " semi-autobiographical , " the publishers call it ? of a Jewish working-class boy growing up in Tunis in the years before the second world war . He is a bright youngster , and through a kind of scholarship system established by the Jewish community he is able to achieve an education far superior to that of the rest- of his ? family . He comes to think of them as benighted Orientals and gives his allegiance to the great culture of France which provides the substance of his education . Then comes the fall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a concentration camp the boy realizes that he is now thoroughly deracinated ; his education has cut him off from his Jewish ? North African heritage , and French culture has betrayed him . He can not express more than the simplest ideas in the dialect of his birth , but he will never speak French without an accent . In the end he somewhat unconvincingly sets sail for a new life in Argentina . This is of course a sub-species of the novel of social mobility lyhose generic title is You Ca n't Co Horne Again . Such novels were particularly frequent in America in the ' thirties , when the Depression often seemed the betrayal of a culture 's promise . But it increases rather than lessens the pleasure of an American reader to see in this book from half-way around the world so many of the same strains he has seen on a smaller scale in his own society , if not in his own life . The Pillar of Salt is in no way a hackneyed hook . It tells a moving story , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memmi 's novel appears with the endorsement of another and better-known and more gifted French writer of North African birth , Albert Camus . As it happens , the hook of Camus recently published , The Myth THE NEW BOOKS of Sisyphus ( Alfred A. Knopf , contains some extremely fine essays on North African cities . Most of the book , as the title indicates , is devoted to Camus ' celebrated essay on the absurd , written fifteen years ago but now for the first time available here . Fortunately limitations of space spare us discussion of this work . THE PROBLEM of race relations is the subject of Laurens van der Post 's Dark Eye in Africa ( Morrow , $3 ) . Van der Post comes from a Dutch family that has been settled in South Africa for three hundred years : but certain experiences , induding imprisonment during the second world war , have led him to disagree with the attitude toward the Negro prevalent among his segment of the South African nation . His book is made up of a lecture originally delivered before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion ? which accounts for its rather peculiar form and perhaps for the way the argument is developed . Van der Post 's central idea is that the European has projected his own unrest on the African . He borrows from Jung the notion that the part of a man 's life he fails to live will be avenged on him , and applies it to race relations . In exalting reason and materialism , in extending his control over things , the light-skinned European , according to van der Post , has denied his instinctual and spiritual nature , with the result that when he sees that aspect of life personified in the dark-skinned African he feels it is a threat and turns upon it . A similar process operates in the dark man , only in reverse . The solution of race relations , then , is for people to change , to become whole by living all aspects of their lives . The argument is developed in language that is slightly cosmic , and solutions that depend upon being born again and being born different do not usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions there are . As readers of his earlier books know , van der Post has an unusually varied and adventurous experience to call upon , and his mind is well stored and original . For some readers the many incidental insights of his book will be more valuable than the central argument . Another psychoanalytical approach to rare relations is offered by Selma Hirsh 's The Fears Men Live By ( Harper , $2.75 ) , but here the orientation is more Freudian than Jungian . Actually Mrs. Hirsh 's book is a summary and interpretation of the many-volumed Studies in Prejudice , which were an effort to combine all the social sciences in the study of prejudice , and relics especially on the best-known volume in the series , The Authoritarian Personality. , by T. W. Adorno and others . Adorno 's book has been subjected to extensive criticism , not all of it favorable by any means : but of books on social science published in this country since the war probably only David Riesman 's The Lonely Crowd has attracted more attention or been more influential . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable body of research . Anyone interested in the actual state of race relations in America will want to rcad Walter C. White 's How Far the Promised Land ? ( Viking , $3.50 ) . Here the late Executive Secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People describes what has happened to the Negro in the United States in the last fifteen years . He tells the story judiciously , with a superb command of the facts and a fine awareness of the international context of American race relations . On the whole it is a hopeful story ; White points out , among other things , that he has not had to include a chapter on lynching . For his last chapter , which turned out to be also the last chapter of a life devoted to Negro progress , White takes his title from Galileo , " Aye , But It Does Move . " EDMUND WILSON 'S essay The Scrolls from the Dead Sea created something of a sensation when it appeared in the New Yorker some months ago , and those who missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more permanent form , will be pleased to know that it is now available as a book ( Oxford , $3.25 ) . Wilson has lengthened his essay by about nine paragraphs and a footnote , though the additions are not so inconsiderable as their enumeration may suggest , since Wilson is not parsimonious about what he will put in one paragraph . In the essay Wilson does three things : he recounts the discovery of the scrolls ( in 1947 ) and their subsequent adventures ; he describes their contents and assesses their importance ; and he draws certain general conclusions from the narrative . The reader who wants to know what happened after a Bedouin boy first found the scrolls in a cave near the Dead Sea will have to read Wilson 's account ; it is a fascinating and complicated story . As for the contents and significance of the scrolls , they greatly expand our knowledge of a Jewish sect called the Essenes which flourished in the Near East in the era between the Old Testament and the New , and they go far toward building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sturdy a bridge remains ? and , it may be safely predicted , will remain ? the subject of scholarly dispute . Two main ideas arise from Wilson 's essay . One is that the scholar uncommitted to religious belief is better able to deal with documents like the scrolls than the scholar with a religious allegiance . Wilson is a little whimsical in adduchig evidence on this point ? he seems to hold it against one distinguished Christian scholar that he has brought out sonic of his work in a periodical published in Pittsburgh . But even if Wilson is in general right , he is left with a paradox something like the one Oppenheimer pointed out : the uncommitted scholar , like the scientist , commands a style that can probe the unknown , but it can not deal with the value of what it investigates . The leaf reason we are interested in the scrolls is that Christianity and Judaism are great sources of value for many people . ! then The Pyramid Texts ( forerunners of The Book of the Dead ) first became available in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an essay in the New Yorker by Edmund Wilson . They were left to the uncommitted scholar , because ancient Egyptian religion had ceased to be a source of value in the lives of men . Wilson 's second idea , which appears largely in the passages added to the original essay , concerns the possible effect on relations between Christians and Jews of the discovery of a closer historical relation between their faiths . Naturally Wilson is hopeful of improvement , but studies of prejudice like those Mrs. Hirsh has drawn upon make his hope appear fragile . Another account of the scrolls addressed to the general reader ? The Dead Sea Scrolls ( Viking , $6.50 ) ? has arrived too late for review . The author , Professor Millar Burrows of Yale , was Director of the American School of Oriental Research when the first manuscripts were discovered and since then has been closely identified with the investigation of their contents . Burrows ' story is less dramatic than Wilson 's and makes more circumscribed claims for the scrolls ; his account of the scholarship is intricate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translations from the scrolls .
