Navy Chaplain Otto Sporrer had been with the Marines long enough to decide that no one else is quite so good a fighting man as a marine , had confirmed his conclusion in Korea . Like many another serviceman , he also had some white-hot observations to make on the inadequacies of fighting men in other outfits . Unlike most , Chaplain Sporrer , a Roman Catholic priest , got his accusations into print in an unsigned article ( title : " The Shame and Glory of Korea " ) in the California newsmagazine Fortnight . Last week copies of Fortnight began popping up all over the Pentagon ; most of them were being exultantly waved by officers of the U.S. Marine Corps . <P> Music with Meals . As chaplain of the 1st Marines , Sporrer saw some of the bitterest fighting in Korea , shared the misery of the marines in their bloody , icy , splendid retreat from the Chosen Basin . There he built up his grievances against Army officers whom he accused of incompetence and claimed were " corrupted with a luxurious love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of courage , bravery and interest in men that are expected . . . " He charged that supplies of such things as " delicate crackers , cookies , cheeses , also vast quantities of beer " being hauled to the front made " necessary transportation difficult . " Said he bitterly : " At General Almond 's headquarters in Hungnam , Korea-the X Corps headquarters-the Officers ' Mess consisted of a nice warmed building in which the food was served in plates , well cooked . There were waiters and an orchestra was available for music . Outside in the bitter cold , long lines of enlisted men stood in order to receive a little heated can of C-rations . Those long lines took three hours to feed . " <P> Chaplain Sporrer had more serious charges to make . During the Korean fighting , he said , many Army officers took leave " without a pass and without orders " to hitch rides on planes back to Japan to visit their families over weekends . On one occasion , he declared , 160 Army officers who had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Tokyo . <P> Afraid to Fire . At the Battle of No Name Ridge , according to Sporrer , an Army battalion on the right flank of the 5th Marines flatly refused to deliver supporting fire because it was afraid it would draw return fire from the enemy . On another occasion , he said , four Army tank crews deserted their tanks and fled by foot when another tank was knocked out by two enemy antitank guns . <P> Asked by California 's Senator William Knowland for comment on the article , the Army at first prepared a blistering denial , point by point . But Major General Floyd Parks , Army Information chief , quashed the reply , wrote instead to Knowland that the Army considered the charges ill-considered and irresponsible , would not reply to them . It was a decision that did the Army credit : Padre Sporrer , a lieutenant commander in the regular Navy , had taken a course that would have scandalized all but the most pop-eyed columnists ; there was no point in letting the incident blow up into an interservice scandal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
