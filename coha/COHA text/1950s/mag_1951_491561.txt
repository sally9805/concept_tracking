O HERE is a hospital in Little Rock , Arkansas , in which a mongrel dog named Susie runs freely in and out , visits the wards and even , on occasion , leaps happily on the patients ' beds . Visiting examiners from the American College of Surgeons , annually scrutinizing procedures at the Arkansas Children 's Home and Hospital , raise their eyebrows at Susie , for dogs are about as welcome as measles in the nation 's infirmaries  --  no telling what they might bring in , including fleas . But aseptic-minded reformers who have attempted to oust Susie or her predecessor , a three-legged police dog named Mike , have collided with the most celebrated dander in Arkansas , the temper of the hospital 's superintendent , Miss Ruth Beall  --  pronounced " Bell . " She does n't care what anybody says about Susie ; the dog performs a necessary function and is going to remain . Susie 's job is to help keep the patients happy . The patients are all children . They come from the poorest homes in the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated to the task of treating the cleft palates , harelips , clubfeet and disease-racked bodies of indigent youngsters . Miss Beall insists that her charges receive the kind of hospital care which would be expected by a Du Pont or Roosevelt scion , although none of them has ever paid a penny to the hospital or to any of the sixty doctors who work there . More than that , she insists that they also receive affection , on the-not-uncommon feminine theory that love is the greatest of all medicines . Anyone who does n't agree with these principles gets very rough treatment from Ruth Beall . She can afford to be independent . She is performing a service done by no other institution in Arkansas . Her seventy-five-bed hospital has no administrative connection with any lodge , university , foundation , Government agency or religious group , and thus takes orders from no one . Further , Miss Bean is successful , her hospital being " A " rated by all the medical societies concerned , and praised alike by medical and social-welfare investigators . Miss Beall is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice which can rage with authority or coo a baby to sleep . She has reddish-black hair now turning gray ; hypnotic eyes and vehement mannerisms . She likes to take physical hold of a conversational adversary , clutching him by the shoulder in an iron grip and poking her face forward until her eyes are only a few inches from his face . She hangs on until her point is made . She once caught an intern drinking babies ' formula , and talked him , in her characteristic manner , out the formula-room door , across a hall , down a stairway , and into a dead end at the extremity of a long corridor . Here she finished her vocal chastisement at some length , berating him for stealing from the babies . She uses the same tactics to extract donations from citizens . Roy W. Spence , an oilman , says , " When you see Ruth Beall coming with that look in her eye , there 's no question of saying ' no ' : you just pray hard she will be lenient , and pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her administrative tactics are equally unusual . She has no office of her own , as she loathes closed doors , appointments and formality . Miss Beall ranges the three-story hospital in a shambling half trot from eight A.M. to midnight , answering phones on every floor , checking up on workers and patients alike , detouring occasionally to the business office to issue orders or dictate a few letters while opening the latest mail . As she goes , like any good housewife she spots and corrects dust and disorder . She rarely sits down , except to eat . She knows each of her patients by name , and never asks a nurse , " How is that rheumatic-fever case today ? " Rather , it is always , " And how is Sally Oates , from Phillips County ? Does she need anything special ? " If there is a need , she goes at once to the telephone and orders it . She pitches in to help with every staff job in the place , from washing dishes to rolling bandages . Chatting with her employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and acts to alleviate them too . She has procured oxygen for the sick husband of a nurse , and sewer pipe for the new home of her supply-room attendant as aggressively as she attends her patients . She wants everyone around her to be happy , workers and patients alike . Miss Beall 's insistence that only the best is adequate has made her beloved by the entire state . She is conceded to have more friends in Arkansas than the state chairman of the Democratic Party . She has no enemies , although she tromps heavily on the toes of anyone she considers inefficient , lazy or uncooperative . She even cusses people a little , which Arkansas ladies are not supposed to do . Her angers , her forthrightness , even her cussing , are known to be short cuts toward her objective , and they are forgiven . One little girl received attention from the Children 's Hospital so much superior to that of her home environment that her mother almost sued Miss Beall for alienation of the daughter 's affections . Only an interview with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from filing her suit . When that story got around Arkansas last year , people who knew Miss Beall understood perfectly . " That 's Ruth , all right , " they said ; " she loves them as though they were her own . " Arkansas is not a wealthy state . Its annual per-capita income is $778 , third lowest in the nation . It has more than its share of poor families . Eighty-five per cent of the Children 's Hospital 's patients come from rural homes which rarely see fifty dollars in cash in one lump . The state is also short of extremely wealthy individuals capable of endowing an institution . So what Miss Beall has done with her hospital , which has no rich benefactor to pick up its deficits , and only $102,000 of endowment compared to annual expenses of $249,000 , is a source of constant wonder . She has the best of everything  --  airconditioned operating rooms , a premature-baby ward , a formula room and ultramodern equipment . She has the only physiotherapy room , the only occupational-therapy department , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . Miss Beall 's young patients have so many toys that their parents never think of bringing them any ; rather , after visiting hours on Sunday , the parents go away loaded with toys , gum , candy and comic books , to take from the sick child to the children at home . Miss Beall maintains the only facility cently she summoned a surgeon from a in Arkansas which ministers to the sur- dinner party to operate until four A.M. gical needs of poor children . Ten other on an accident case . When she diso hospitals have a total of 101 beds re- covered late one night that a promiserved for children , but these are used nent doctor had not checked post-for the pay patients of private practi- operatively on one of her cases , she tioners . The Children 's Hospital re- awoke him by telephone . " You get pairs congenital deformities , straight- down here , " she barked , " or I 'll come ens twisted spines , heals third-degree and get you in your nightshirt . What burns  --  of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pool incidence among juveniles  --  and other- hall ? " She called Dr. J. B.

" We walk into ing an address . " Anybody can make the future on the feet of our children , " that speech , " she told him . " Only you Miss Beall likes to say , " and we must can save this child . " not limp on clubfeet . " By such direct methods , Miss Beall During the fiscal year 1950 the hos- gets things done . Oddly , the doctors pital performed 316 major operations like to be bullied , and tell one another and 516 minor operations , applied 1260 how she has victimized them , and in Plaster casts , treated 1245 outpatients what picturesque language . Dr. Joe E. and gave convalescent treatment to 450 Shuffield , the busiest bone specialist in Polio patients . In addition it treated at Arkansas , describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's like a pounding surf ; just keeps children were kicked by mules , shot in moving in until something crumbles . So hunting accidents , burned in fires or when she calls , you save time in the swallowed the contents of lye cans . It also took in twenty-four premature babies , one of which weighed only thirty ounces . The doctors convert rib bones into chins , put living corneas in the eyes of blind children , lengthen legs and correct the effects of spinal tuberculosis as a matter of routine . Three fourths of the work is orthopedic , the average such case being under treatment for four and a half years , of which forty-two days are spent in the hospital . One girl , treated for five years after having been immobilized in both arms and both legs by infantile paralysis , went on to graduate at the head of her high-school class , marry and rear a family . A boy so badly doubled up from burns that his knees and chin had grown together walked again after thirty-two skin grafts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are referred to her by state and other social agencies , others by the Arkansas chapter of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis . Most of them , however , come from country doctors or directly from the parents involved . A an far up in the Ozarks telephoned Miss Beall one day , saying his nineYear-old son was suffering from a double hernia , and asked the hospital to help hun . " I do n't have a bed right now , " Miss Beall answered , " but when I get one , I 'll let you know . " Five days later the man and boy arrived at the hospital In a borrowed pickup truck . The father not only unloaded his son but also a hand-hewn bed he had made from a Picture in a hospital-supply catalogue , using hardware cloth for springs . " Since You do n't have a bed , I made you one , " he explained . Miss Beall set the bed up Ili a corridor , for lack of room space , and admitted the child . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help themselves , " she said . Dr. Ellery C. Gay , chief of the medical staff , estimates that the sixty surgeons , orthopedists and pediatricians of Little Rock , all of them private practitioners , donated to the Children s Hospital in 1950 services which , if Charged for at a bare minimum fee , Would have enriched them by $740,000 , or , at average fees , by$1,100,000 . Dr. W. Verne Newman , chief of orthopedics , likes to point out that under a system of state medicine none of that work would have been done at all , since Miss Rave methods are too unorthodox to survive Government standardization , and her personality too vitriolic to ap ? Pease politicians . Miss Beall can be rough on the doctors , all of whom work for nothing . Reerally credited with this philanthropy . Cooper Jacoway , an attorney , was persuaded to head a fund drive . The oilman , Mr. Spence , was sent to Memphis , Tennessee , to put the bite on Harvey Couch , a noted philanthropist . Couch promised to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each . Spence located three , then in desperation put $350 worth of small checks together , begged $150 from another source , and got the last donor to take all the small checks and give him a draft for $500 . Confronted with the four $500 donations , Couch faithfully paid in his $1000 . Later Spence 's conscience bothered him . He went to Couch and said , " I subterfuged you . " " I knew that all the time , " Couch replied . " Nobody in his right mind would give $500 to that bankrupt hospital , and there are only three rich idiots in Arkansas . " By such unorthodox tactics , $16,000 was raised . Miss Beall 's next move was to persuade A. L. Barber , a corporation lawyer , to become chairman of the trustees , on the theory that with bondholders constantly at her throat , a good legal mind was imperative . Barber more than repaid her confidence , by becoming her partner in crime which got him on such a hook that he was unable to extricate himself for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bondholders had first claim on any money that was raised . With her charges eating poorly and lacking essential medicines , Miss Beall would not part with her hard-raised cash . She opened a lock box in a bank , put into it the first $7000 raised in the fund drive , and failed to report this cache to anyone except Barber . From it she paid C.O.D . urgencies for two years . Barber was also busy . Certain endowments , earmarked for specific uses of the orphans , totaled $32,000 . Mr. Barber " borrowed " these funds to pay off the out-of-state bondholders , figuring he could keep local people under control more easily than people in other states . Barber figured that eventually the citizens would raise sufficient money to put the endowment back . Not until the last dollar of endowment was safely restored , in 1941 , was he able to step down as president . Miss Beall did her part to get him out of the hole , by her economical administration . Restoration of buildings was the costliest problem . Little Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance as plaster cracks , walls shift and foundations sink . Under the Public Works Administration Act of depression days , materials were available to institutions for repairs , but not labor . Miss Beall conspired with local administrators to get $33,000 worth of needed brick , steel , cement , plaster and other building materials , which she stacked or stowed all over the hospital . Then she went to WPA which could provide labor , but not materials , proved she had the materials , and so got the labor to renovate her plant completely . This type of ingenuity still continues . In 1950 she talked the city 's union painters into a mass demonstration , for clean-up-paint-up week , of how fast they could paint the exterior trim of her buildings ; one hundred of them did it in one hour , and charged nothing . The most urgent continuous need , when Miss Beall undertook her job , was food and other household supplies , which totaled $1000 a month . Like any housewife , she decided that the way to accumulate cash was to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tuberculosis Association , she had interested the Benton County Home Demonstration Clubs in pushing the Christmas Seal campaign . Here was a vast reservoir of farm women who had little cash , but much good will . The clubs , a function of the county agent 's office , taught health , diet and homemaking to rural Arkansas . Throughout the state there were 1626 such clubs with 39,000 members . To them she appealed for aid . Today Ruth Beall 's hospital gets 50,000 quarts of canned fruit and vegetables annually , tons of potatoes and tomatoes , strawberries and meat from the Home Demonstration Clubs , and all the needed pajamas and bedding . County game wardens supply deer and ducks taken out of season . This help enabled Miss Beall to retire $60 , - 000 of debt in six years on housekeeping savings . Miss Beall 's next coup was political . She argued that the counties should support her institutions , since she was treating children from every county . Legislation legalizing such appropriations was slipped into a very popular agricultural-extension bill and passed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $30,000 a year for the hospital . Miss Beall then persuaded the Arkansas legislature to support a direct state appropriation , which amounts to $25,000 a year . She saw Federal aid to unfortunate children coming , and moved in to get a share for Arkansas . Even before the Social Security Act had been passed she talked the then state attorney general , Carl E. Bailey , the father of six children , into sponsoring an official opinion that her hospital would be eligible for Federal aid . Fortunately , Bailey became governor a year later , and nailed down the hospital 's tenuous position by recognizing it as an agency eligible for aid under a new State Department of Public Welfare . Miss Beall 's energy here paid off . In fiscal year 1950 she received $81,684.46 for patient care from state-Federal funds administered by the welfare agency . Another remarkable bit of foresight surrounded the establishment in Arkansas of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis . The first President 's birthday ball , in 1936 , was a success in Little Rock primarily because Ruth Beal/ flooded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polio . Last year the foundation paid the hospital $83 , - 782.54 for treatment of polio-victimized children . This was Miss Beall 's largest single source of income . Her budgeting is legerdemain to her trustees , all of them prominent businessmen accustomed to precise accounting . " She spends money like my wife , " one of the trustees says . " Whatever she gets her hands on goes for the urgent immediate need ; then she comes back for more . " Under Miss Beall , the orphanage , which was the original reason for the institution , has become a side line and eventually will be abandoned , on the theory that she should concentrate on providing the greatest good for the greatest number . The foundling home looks like no other orphanage in the world . Its inmates ? there are eighteen at present  --  are treated as if they were members of Ruth Beall 's family . They attend public schools , participate in school and city social life , dress individualistically , have dates , and bring their friends home for table tennis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POST Febrour ? 17 , 1951 ( Corn d fr Page 69 ) gives each of them a cash allowance and a mother 's attention . None are put out for adoption , Miss Beall raising them until they are ready to make their way in the world . In the fifteen years Miss Beall has used this system , none of her charges has ever become a delinquent , and none of her 155 graduates has ever subsequently been in jail , on relief or a criminal or a social-agency problem . Ruth 's hospital today is out of debt . Moreover , it is back in the good graces of the medical societies , back in the Community Chest , and is expanding its services at the rate of 14 per cent more patients each year . The latest innovation is an outpatient department . This facility enabled the hospital in 1950 to augment its orthopedic services nearly 200 per cent over the 1949 case bed cost . It also has permitted Miss Beall to do quietly something that has been on her conscience for a long time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without her board 's knowledge , a clubfoot clinic for colored children , who heretofore have been neglected . Arkansas generally offers virtually no facility for hospitalizing indigent colored youngsters , despite the fact that the state population is 25 per cent Negro , a situation high-lighted in 1948 by Dr. Francis F. Schwentker , of Johns Hopkins Hospital , in a survey which he made for Miss Beall . Miss Beall feels guilty about this neglect , and has been after her trustees to let her do something about it since 1945 . They now have in blueprint , and hope to build in two years a $250,000 increasing its capacity to 200 beds . One wing with sixty-five beds will , with the outpatient department , adequately meet the colored children 's needs as estimated by Doctor Schwentker . There was some anxiety among Miss Beall 's well-wishers when this innovation was proposed . " Do you think she can do it ? " one asked hesitantly . " Do it ! " exclaimed Cooper Jacoway , who is still a member of the trustees ' board . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donated by the state Masonic lodges . I 'll bet you ten to one she builds the new hospital at the same time . " No one took the bet , even at those odds . In Arkansas people have learned not to bet against Ruth Beall.
