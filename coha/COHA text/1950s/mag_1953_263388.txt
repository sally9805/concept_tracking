Sightseeing during an atomic bombing is unwise ; it may destroy the sight of anyone who is otherwise safe from the heat and blast . This is the warning of Ophthalmologist Heinrich W. Rose and Biophysicist Konrad Buettner , who looked into the matter at the Air Force School of Aviation Medicine . <P> In the case of a " nominal " ( Nagasaki-type ) atomic bomb , the heat cooks the skin up to two miles away . But if a person happens to be looking at the detonation , he will certainly be blinded permanently at more than four miles away , and even at a greater distance his eyesight will be seriously damaged . <P> The cause is a simple optical principle . The burning effect of the bomb 's heat on exposed skin diminishes as the square of the distance ( twice as far away , it is one-fourth as strong ) . But the eye is a lens that concentrates heat and light in a spot on the retina . As distances increase , the spot grows smaller but remains as bright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across forms a brilliant spot on the retina 1/300th of an inch in diameter . This is larger than the fovea centralis , the part of the retina that is used in accurate vision . <P> At four miles , enough heat will be concentrated on this area to cook the tissue , which will turn to something like hard-boiled white of egg . The immediate effect will be a large blind spot . Then , as inflammation spreads , the eye will lose its sight entirely . At night , when the pupil is wide open , blinding will occur at 25 miles or more . <P> If the atomic sightseer happens to be looking to one side of the fireball , his blind spot will not cover the center of his visual field , and the blindness is less likely to be permanent . But even off-center views of the bomb will make him partially or temporarily blind . <P> No count was made of people blinded at Hiroshima and Nagasaki ; perhaps few people were looking into the sky at the right moment . If modern bombs attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than four miles , for they are far brighter than the nominal bombs were . Hydrogen bombs , say Drs . Rose and Buettner , will probably blind from as far away as they can be seen at all .
