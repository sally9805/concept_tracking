How to Use a Newspaper If a newspaper stacks up all the facts in a news story , is it fulfilling its responsibility to its readers ? Many an editor who likes to call such treatment " objective reporting " thinks it is . The Christian Science Monitor 's able Editor Erwin D. Canham thinks it is n't , and last week wound up a six-part , Page One series of articles that told his readers why . <P> The concept of objective reporting , said he , is basically wrong ; the facts need careful interpretation if they are to explain to readers the significance of happenings in the modern world . " Spike " Canham , who has steered the Monitor toward more realistic news coverage by just such stressing of interpretive reporting , explained his philosophy under the headline : HOW TO USE YOUR NEWSPAPER . It was also an important lecture to newsmen on how to edit one . <P> " Just to print news will not suffice for a modern newspaper , " he wrote . " Newspapers must tell the meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so misleading as to be false . For example , it is a customary editorial assumption that if an important man says it , it 's news . But what if the important man says something that is essentially a lie ? . . . It happens nowadays , and not only in Moscow . If we print only the factual press association story . . . we are flagrantly misinforming readers . It is not enough to catch up with the lie on the editorial page a day or two later . " <P> To be certain that " the balancing fact " is tacked on to " the misleading assertion , " the Monitor prints far more stories from its 81 correspondents and its 2,000-odd special contributors than it does from its three wire services - A.P. , U.P . and Reuters . " We think this balancing fact is more important than hasty headlines . So we do not hesitate to hold up a misleading story until we can link with it the necessary fact . Our own correspondents are instructed to do this before they file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , this interpretive function need entail no more editorializing than is involved , for example , when an editor decides to print one story and not another . But interpretation requires integrity and knowledge and understanding and balance and detachment . . . News interpretation is all too readily misunderstood . Whenever interpretations differ from the preconceived notions of readers , misunderstanding is likely to creep in . " Objectivity is a very elusive thing . It usually means , to the individual , agreement with his own views . . . This is a problem newspapers can solve in the long run by steadfast news objectivity and honest interpretation . But it sometimes seems to be an uphill road . "
