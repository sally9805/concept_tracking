txt Is the recently demonstrated improvement on the part of the rest of the . world to earn dollars purely adventitious and transitory or does it contain elements that can be expected to be more or less permanent ? Opinion has been fairly general in Europe , according to Michael L. Hoffman , our economic specialist there , that the former is the case . But that is not the official view in Washington , as Mr. Hoffman points out , if we are to take the word of one highranking American economic adviser . He is Winthrop Brown , and he is economic counselor to the United States Embassy in London . Mr. Brown , who participated in a general discussion of the subject at Geneva this week with representatives of the contracting parties of G. A. T. T. ( the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ) , took the position that the recent swing in the over-all balance of payments in favor of countries other than the United States reflects certain funds " mental adjustments in the pattern of world trade that give promise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress made in checking inflation , " the other is the expansion of output . Simon Reisman , Canadian representative , offered , a contribution , incidentally , that indicated he was thinking more or less along the same lines as Mr. Brown . European representatives , Mr. Reisman suggested , " should study carefully the British record in the matter of loosening import controls . " Britain has demonstrated , he said , that getting rid of control systems which discriminate against " hard money " countries such as the United States and Canada " can contribute by itself to strengthening a nation 's international financial position . " It is n't necessary to assert  --  and neither of these experts has asserted ? that the present pattern of international payments is permanent to point out that it is completely defeatist to assume that nothing about it is permanent . The pattern of international payments has rarely remained constant over any considerable period , and the kaleidoscopic variatkons before , during and after . the last war were espe-1 cially dramatic . The approach of war in Europe calked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's history , simply because this seemed to be the safest place of refuge . From $12.8 billions at the end of 1937 our gold stocks almost doubled in the ensuing four years , rising by $10 billions to $22.8 billions . In the years 1942-45 , when Lend-Lease was ' the key instrument of our wartime foreign trade policy , we lost nearly , $3 billions of the metal . World post-war reconstruction was the dominant motif in Ithe period 1946-49 and-in those years the movement on balance each year was heavily- toward this country . In 1950 , with the coming ; of . the Korean war , our reliance= On ; the outside world for raw ' : materials was refleeted in a gold loss , . kf:1oVer1 , - $1.7 billions . But even after that - ether : gency passed the world ' ; Continued to add to its gold ' and dollar holdings : In 1951 the sterling area suffered a crisis of confidence and lost $685 ' millions , ibut despite this fact countries other than the United States increased their-stocks by $78 millions : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second quarter of 1952 , when Britain had about completed the task of halting the flight- from-sterling . By the second half of .1952'the United States surplus of payments , exclusive of military aid shipments , had disappeared . Between the end of the first quarter of 1952 and the second quarter . of 1953 gold stocks outside the United States had risen by about $2.7 billions . It is estimated that the net for 1953 as a whole will be in the neighborhood of $2.5 billions . Simply to sit back and say that this is " not significant because it can not last is completely irrational . If there is such a thing as a " normal " state of international payments , one thing is certain . Present conditions are far less abnormal than those which immediately followed the war or which dominated the period of post-war reconstruction . There ate possibilities in intelligent foreign trade policies today that were nonexistent in either of those periods . '
