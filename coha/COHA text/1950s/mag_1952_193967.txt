" Here we are in Rome , " complained an American tourist , camera in hand and vivid sport shirt on torso , one red-hot day last week . " But where are the Romans ? " <P> They were taking a holiday . It was Ferragosto Day ( Aug. 15 ) , Italy 's best loved and most ancient annual holiday , * and from the teeming Eternal City ( pop . 1,600,000 ) a million Romans decamped to their seaside villas and to public picnic grounds in the Abruzzi Mountains or at war-famed Anzio Beach . Shops , offices , banks , even Vatican City 's Sistine Chapel , were closed up tight , though St. Peter 's , as always , stayed open . Garbage went uncollected. milk undelivered , newspapers unpublished and tourists unsolicited by the prostitutes in Villa Borghese park . At his summer palace of Castel Gandolfo . Pope Pius XII rested for a couple of days ; so did Premier Alcide de Gasperi and most of his political friends and enemies . Communist Boss Palmiro Togliatti spent the weekend hiking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even the cops disappeared from Rome 's deserted boulevards . Explained one of the sweating few who remained at his post : " There 's nothing for policemen to do . No respectable crook would be caught dead in town on Ferragosto . " <P> <P> * Rome has celebrated Ferragosto for some 2,000 years . Most historians trace its origin to the three-day jeriae augustales ( holidays of Augustus ) proclaimed in 29 B.C. in honor of the triumphant return of Caesar Augustus from his campaign against Antony and Cleopatra . Some say it has even earlier beginnings . Six centuries later it became a universal Roman Catholic holiday , celebrating the anniversary of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary into heaven .
