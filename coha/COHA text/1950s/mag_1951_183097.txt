MORNING JOURNEY ( 345 pp. ) - James Hilton-Little , Brown ( $3 ) . <P> <P> " He had been left money and a job by his father , a Wall Street man of the old school , while his mother had contributed good looks and . . . innate good tastes in the arts . Education at Groton and Harvard had followed , after which there had been years of hard work . In 1920 , aged 36 , he had married a New Hampshire girl who loved horses and dogs ... so he had bought some land in Connecticut and there they had spent much of each year . . . In 1925 she had died in an influenza epidemic , leaving a boy of three named Norris . . . During school holidays , when Norris was at home , he sometimes took the boy to places like the Metropolitan Museum and the Statue of Liberty . " <P> When fans of fast fiction see a paragraph of this kind lumbering up the page like something escaped from an old copy of Who 's Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again at a point where the going is not quite so statuesque . The trouble with James Hilton 's new novel is that anybody who tries to skip such dull parts will be obliged to skip the whole book . <P> Morning Journey is totally unlike Novelist Hilton 's big hits , Goodbye , Mr. Chips and Lost Horizon . It is the story of a stage-struck Irish colleen named Carey , who pines for stardom and is raised to it by a producer who is a theatrical genius . He also marries Carey , but , like all geniuses in fiction , is too much of a heel to toe the married line . So Carey swaps him for a likable millionaire-only to conclude , after a couple of hundred pages of tightly packed pondering , that the path of genius , however rough , is preferable to Wall Street . <P> In Novelist Hilton 's hands , this plot goes from ham to Spam . Had he shown but a spark of Carey 's fondness for drama , Morning Journey might have turned into as much of a grassfire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , readers can only look on with morbid fascination while Novelist Hilton earnestly lights the fires of one dramatic episode after another and then , swiftly dropping his matches and snatching up a fire bucket , pours suffocating streams of cold water over the struggling flames .
