" Step right up , folks , and have your health checked , " blared the sound trucks on lower Manhattan 's Mulberry Street last week . " Step up and get a blood test- it 's free , it 's easy and it 's quick . " Befitting Mulberry Street 's cosmopolitanism , the English spiels alternated with the same pitch in Italian , Spanish and Chinese . At three intersections spaced two blocks apart , teams of clerks and technicians from the city 's Health Department were ready for the customers at sidewalk stands surrounded by hospital screens . <P> If a passerby , puzzled by the vague wording of the come-on , asked what the test was for , he got a forthright answer : syphilis .

But plenty of men ( and a few women ) interrupted their window-shopping or lunchtime sauntering to step behind the screens and take the test . <P> <P> With one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it , a technician slipped a needle into a vein and drew out 5 cc of blood . The donor 's name and address were noted and he was promised a prompt report by mail . Of the first day 's 415 samples , 388 were negative ; the rest were positive or doubtful . To each of these 27 subjects went a letter asking him to return for further testing or to see his own doctor and have him send the Health Department a report . After a while , if it hears nothing , the Health Department will do some sleuthing . <P> Behind the New York City campaign is a U.S. Public Health Service grant of $50,000 to try to find out how many unreported and probably unsuspected cases of syphilis are walking the streets . Experts believe that even if every new case of syphilis could be cured by penicillin , the disease still would not die out because there is always an infectious reservoir of old and unreported cases . On the sidewalks of Mulberry Street they hope to learn something about the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
