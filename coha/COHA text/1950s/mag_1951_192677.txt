Each week thousands of railroadmen , truck drivers and pilots are at their jobs around the clock to speed TIME to a newsstand conveniently near you . Recently , we asked one of our Midwest correspondents to interview one of them-a St. Louis truck driver-to give us a closer look at one of the many people who handle newsstand copies of TIME in transit . He was 48-year-old John Deibel , a senior highway pilot for the Consolidated Forwarding Co . If your copy of TIME this week came from a newsstand in the St. Louis area , it was hauled from Chicago by Deibel . <P> On Wednesday afternoon , Deibel jockeyed his shiny orange tractor #684 against the big trailer at Consolidated 's Chicago transfer garage . He motioned toward the trailer loaded with 2,350 copies of TIME . <P> Explained Deibel : " When I come in they say , ' Get going , Johnny , you got the magazines . ' That means , ' Keep pushing it along , Johnny , and do n't stop to beat your gums on the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride which shows through Deibel 's curt shop talk . He wears a red C.F.C. badge above his visor for his twelve-year safety record . He 's proud too ( but wears no badge for it ) of his regular , five-year-long assignment to haul TIME . TIME 's schedules are known to be so tough that 48 trucking companies from coast to coast use their TIME contracts to get other fast-delivery business . <P> Out of Chicago , Deibel 's first stop was at Chenoa , Ill. at Steve 's Cafe . " Best steaks on Route 66 , " he claims , with the truck driver 's air of finality about such matters . There he had time for his meal , no time for trivial talk . A short distance behind him rolled another Consolidated truck , with a " straight load " - goods without such a demanding time schedule . If #684 were to break down , they would switch trailers and the other driver would haul TIME to St. Louis . It has n't happened yet . <P> Behind Johnny and the whole system are other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is printed in plants in Los Angeles , Chicago , Philadelphia , Paris , Honolulu , Tokyo and Havana ( where we just recently began printing the Latin American Edition ) . If deliveries from one printing point are endangered , other points can come to the rescue . And , of course , copies can be shifted back &; forth among newsstands and local distributing centers . In emergencies , extra copies have been flown to disaster points to avoid delays in delivery . When virtually all forms of land transport were bogged down by the July floods of the Kansas River , copies were rerouted around the flood area by an ingenious truck and train system-and got to subscribers and newsstands with minimum delay . <P> While Driver Deibel was on the road , 127 other trucks were hauling other newsstand copies of the U.S. Edition . More than half , however , of the total newsstand supply were delivered by Railway Express , frequently using crack passenger trains . Meanwhile , a few thousand newsstand copies were being flown to posts in Canada and Alaska and pilots were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editions to six continents and over five seas to all the far-flung places where TIME is read . <P> Cordially yours ,
