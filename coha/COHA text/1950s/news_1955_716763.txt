txt A cold winter 's morning a couple of weeks ago Paul Crandall looked out the kitchen window of his Beverly . Mass. , home . It was early . The family was just sitting down to the morning meal . The boy turned to his father , Arthur C. Crandall , Beverly police sergeant . " Dad , " he said with surprise , " Donald is hanging around out in the yard . " " Invite him in , " Sgt. Crandall told his young son . Guest for Breakfast Bashfully , eleven - year - old Donald entered the warm kitchen . Had he had breakfast ? No , he had n't . The Crandalls set a place for him . The two boys spent the day playing together . Donald ate a hearty dinner . When the sergeant lea for duty , he drove the boy downtown with him , gave him enough money for a movie . The next morning before breakfast Donald was back in the Crandalls ' yard . His little brother was with him . " Those boys have terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what happens when you give them just a little attention . It shows how easy it is to keep kids out of trouble and going right . " This is the story of the man who this week was honored for his almost singlehanded job of founding and operating on a shoestring the Beverly Boys ' Club . The Big Brother , Big Sister , and Jewish Big Brother ? ssociations of Boston selected Sgt. Crandall as the person most deserving of their Service to Youth Award , given this year for the first time . Another award was presented by them to the New Bedford Kiwanis Club . The associations feel that the absence of a serious juvenile delinquency problem in Beverly can be attributed in large degree to the efforts of this police officer . Sergeant Crandall knows about boys . He has three of his own  --  Paul , the youngest . Richard , in high school . and Arthur , now assigned to a Navy bomber . The brown shingled house at 31 Northern Avenue where the family lives has become a mecca for boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had a lot of them here for dinner or supper , " the sergeant said . " They drop by and call me up all the time . They ride here w ? thew bikes from all over the city . " Club Started in 1951 How does Mrs. Crandall respond to this stream ' of unexpected dinner guests ? " I 've got the best wife in the world , " Sergeant Crandall says . She likes kids . She knows how to bring them up . We have a happy home here , a really happy home . " ? If you ask the sergeant what he considers is the cause of juvenile delinquency , he will tell you that " home life is a big part . " There must be love and obedience there , ' he says , " If parents have n't instilled faith in their kids . the love of their parents , they have missed the boat , in my opinion . If a boy goes out and is tempted to do something wrong , hem think about his mother and dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought him up right , he wo n't do it . " The idea of the Boys ' Club began in 1951 when four boys , 8 to 12 years old , were caught stealing candy and toys . Sergeant Crandall went to one boy 's house three times in one week . When the children were brought to the police station , the sergeant invited them to the guard room . " I did n't mention anything about what they did , just treated them like my own sons . " he said . " We played checkers and cards . The little fellow eight years old went right to sleep . He did n't know what he had done . He had just gone along with his older brother . " I kept them busy and then told them they could come back the next week if they wanted to . The following Monday night eight came . Every week there were more and more . " The sergeant later learned that the ringleader was a boy whose mother had deserted the family . His father had boarded him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of her own . " So naturally the kid had no home life at all . " Sergeant Crandall said . " I made sure he came every week and he turned out all right , believe it or not . " Every Monday night since that first one , boys 8 to 15 years old have met with the sergeant . Like many of the boys themselves , the club has gone from pillar to post , seeking larger quarters as their numbers grew to 225 . Inadequate Quarters First it was the police station guardroom , then the city garage , arranged for by Mayor Clarence S. Wilkinson , then a school auditorium . When that was filled with classes they moved on to their present smaller " post , " American Legion Post 331 . Sergeant Crandall 's greatest concern now is the lack of adequate quarters . It saddens him to think ? that attendance has dropped to only 75 to 100 boys . not because the others wo n't come but because there just is n't room . " We do n't have things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we had sports , a place to shoot a basketball , they would love that As long as the boys want the club , I 'll keep it up but I would like to have something to work with I almost quit two or three times . It 's pretty discouraging sometimes . If I had facilities I know I could put 300 or 400 boys in there . " He said there is no conflict between his group and Beverly 's YMCA . A lot of his boys could n't even afford to pay " Y " dues . There is no charge in the Boys ' Club . Pledge to Flag Club meetings begin with raising the American flag and the pledge of allegiance . Then the sergeant gives the boys a five-minute talk on safety measures and any special information he thinks they should have . After that come games . The boys who proudly wear the club badge abide by strict rules . " Anybody swears ? out they go . " the sergeant says . " There is no swearing and no fighting . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they wo n't go home . They stay outside the door crying . The next tune they are all right . " Since receiving the award this week Sergeant Crandall has gotten a letter from a prisoner in a state institution . The Man , who , like the sergeant , was a Beverly boy , said he has decided to " go straight " and when he gets out he wants to help him with what he is doing .
