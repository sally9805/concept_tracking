In the Manhattan jazz den known as Birdland , the seven-man combo was swinging up a storm . Its music had a fine , contrapuntal texture , played with a neatly organized air that is not characteristic of such outfits , and was several degrees warmer than most modern jazz . The leader : Austria 's excellent young ( 26 ) Concert Pianist Friedrich Gulda , making his first professional appearance as a jazzman . <P> He sat at the grand piano , his large head listing heavily to port , his horn rims and high forehead giving him a scholarly appearance . Before him stood four blowers on trumpet , trombone and saxophones , men whose personal styles seemed almost perfectly adapted to the Gulda idiom . During the evening 's five half-hour sets they played a round dozen of Gulda 's own compositions-pretty , slightly sentimental ditties with such names as Air from Other Planets , Dodo , Scruby , New Shoes-plus his arrangements of other men 's tunes . Whatever the music , it had one mark of good jazz : it stimulated the performers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pianist Gulda joined his long-haired colleagues in a general sneer for jazz . But he found himself listening to records of Count Basie and Duke Ellington , and gradually his attitude changed . Last year , between concert tours ( he has played four times in Carnegie Hall ) , he organized a group of musicians in Vienna , wrote out jazz-style counterpoint for them and made a series of broadcasts . American Jazz Buff John Hammond , who had a significant part in the careers of Basie and Benny Goodman , listened to off-the-air recordings and flipped for joy . He helped Gulda gather his combo in the U.S. , got him booked into Birdland and also for Newport 's American Jazz Festival next week . <P> Finding himself in a world he once looked at down his nose turns out to be a relief to Gulda . " Everybody agrees that something is out of order with concert music , " he says . In Gulda 's case , he did not like contemporary music , yet yearned to play something new , so jazz became " a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices his usual three hours daily on his concert music , then turns to jazz at night . Thus concert halls have not lost a son , but jazz halls have gained one . " At first I was afraid for my career , " he says . " But this became inevitable , so I let it happen . "
