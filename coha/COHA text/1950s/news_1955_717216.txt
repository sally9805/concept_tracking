txt The engineer was killed and twenty-four persons were injured today when the Federal , crack New Haven Railroad train , jumped the rails on a sharp curve just south of the Bridgeport station . Fifteen of the train 's seventeen cars were derailed . Seven of them hurtled down a thirty-foot embankment , coming to rest in a mass of twisted steel , debris and high-tension wires torn down by the plunging locomotive . About 175 persons were on the Washington-Boston express . As a result of the wreck , morning inbound trains to New York were reported thirty to ninety minutes late . Commuter trains leaving in the evening from Grand Central Terminal were delayed ten to fifteen minutes . A routine procedure carried out just twenty minutes before the pre-dawn wreck was credited with having prevented a major disaster . At 4:20 A. M. , David A. Griffith , the conductor , had moved all day coach passengers from the forward to the rear cars , preparatory to taking on more passengers at New Haven . At 4:40 A. M. , while the train was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad , the express left the tracks . The forward day coaches , then empty , were among the cars that plunged down the embankment . They jackknifed as- they hit steel girders holding the high-tension wires and caught fire as the wires fell across them . The . dead man was Arthur ? Orteneau , 62 years old , of New Haven , Conn . His fireman , George S. Kennedy , 34 , escaped with minor back injuries . He was released from St. Vincent 's Hospital , this afternoon and taken to his home in East Haven , Conn . The ' engineer 's body was recovered early this afternoon . Firemen , the police and a New Haven Railroad crew worked more than seven hours to cut it free from the wreckage . Of the twenty-four persons injured , twelve had been released from St. Vincent 's Hospital and the Bridgeport Hospital by midafternoon . The condition of the others was described as fair or good . The New York , New Haven and Hartford Railroad and the Connecticut Public Utilities Commission began separate investigations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials concerned would express an opinion on why the train left the rails . In a statement issued in New York , Patrick B. , president of the New Haven Railroad , said : " Reports reaching me indicate that the accident was not caused by faulty equipment . Happening as it did on the severest curve on the New Haven Railroad , the accident seems to point up our need for the low-center-ofgrtevity trains , which Ihave been advocating and four of which I have ordered . We are thankful that God was with us in that more persons were not killed . " Similar Wreck in 1911 The wreck occurred a quartermile from the Bridgeport station and less than a sidle from the spot where an express , on the same run and also running late , was derailed on July 11 , 1911 . Fourteen of the 150 passengers were killed then . Railroad regulations call for a maximum speed of thirty miles an hour on the curve where the wreck occurred . Paul R. Goulett , the New Haven 's vice president in charge of operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , but added : " The tragic death Of our engineer will prevent us from ever knowing what happened . " Joseph Sanso , the baggagemaster who was alone in the baggage car , said the train seemed to be moving at normal speed when it passed Fairfield , five miles from Bridgeport . Soon afterward , he explained the emergency air brakes suddenly went on , the lights went out and the car teetered as the wheels bumped over the track ties . The Federal left Washington at 11 o'clock last night and was scheduled to arrive at New Haven at 4:40 A. M. today . It was twenty-six minutes late passing Norwalk , about thirty miles from New Haven on the railroad . At 4 A. M. , according to William F. Hartford , a ticket taker on the train , it was running " very late . " Swerved Half Way on Curve About half-way into the curve the engine swerved to the right . Io pulled up track and ties as it tore across the narrow gravel way at the top of the embankment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose to fall alone-into the railroad yards below . It landed on a switching locomotive just preparing to haul freight . The plunging engine struck full force just a few feet from the cab of Willard B. Tallerdy of Fairfield , the engineer of the switching train . He escaped with minor injuries . On the other side of the eight-track viaduct on which the curve is built , there is a straight thirty-foot drop onto Water Street . A derailment on that ' side would have caused far , greater damage and probably a much larger number of casualties . As the engine and cars plunged down the embankment , they crashed into two catenaries  --  the huge steel structures that span the tracks and carry high tension wires of the railroad and the United Illuminating Company . Both the railroad 's lines , carrying 11,000 volts , and the elecItrio company 's wires with 69,000 volts were torn down . One of the empty forward day coaches was wrapped around a catenary and hung there in a ! grotesque pattern . Most of the injured were in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sixth and seventh cars of the train . John Donovan , night yardmaster at the Whiting Street yards , where the locomotive fell , sounded the first alarm . He was sitting in his office when the lights went out . Then he saw the railroad wires coming down and a great cloud of dust rising in the area . Mr. Donovan phoned the dispatcher to stop all trains and summoned the Bridgeport Police and Fire Department ambulances . As the extent of the wreck became known other ambulances were called in from surrouning communities . The firemen , police and railroad workers first on the scene began helping the stunned passengers from the cars . Many of passengers , among them a large number of service men , joined in the rescue work after recovering quickly from the shaking up . The injured were removed to the edge of the ' viaduct and lowered to the ambulances waiting on the street below . In the street , weary and dazed passengers , some in nightclothes , wandered around , unsure of just what had happened . Within an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passengers to the near-by Bridgeport station ) and to downtown hotels . Later buses were obtained to speed the work . The wreck disrupted electric service to parts of Bridgeport , Fairfield and Stratford . How-1 ever , service was restored in all ' parts of the area by 8 A. M. Railroad crews were'at work quickly after the wreck . Within , ' nine hours the line had , been suf-1 ficiently cleared for the first train , pulled by a Diesel engine , to move slowly past the wreckage . ? sp , 4 Three more trains , pulled by Diesel engines , crossed the viaduct between 1 and 2 P. M. Railroad officials said they did not expect to restore the electric power at the spot for-some time . The line was still far from normal late tonight . There were two children among the passengers and both escaped with minor bruises . The youngest , 4-year-old Shelley Ann Whyte , accompanied her mother , Mrs. Josephine Whyte of Washington , to St. Vincent 's Hospital . Mrs. Whyte suffered a head injury . Like Shelley Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injured . He was traveling alone from Baltimore to meet his parents in Bangor , Me . A railroad employe put him on a bus to New Haven , where Traveler 's Aid attendants transferred him to another Boston-bound train . Mr. Sanso , the baggage master , crawled out of the overturned baggage car after it had rolled down the embankment . Persons at the scene rushed to his side and tried to persuade him to board an ambulance . But he refused medical aid until he had removed all baggage from the car and had posted a New Haven special policeman to guard the piled luggage . The sky over the wreckage lit up as in a giant fireworks display when the power lines came I down . Some of the high voltage lines fell close by but not across one of the Pullman cars that overturned on its side .
