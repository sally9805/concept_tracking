When the French deposed Morocco 's Sultan Sidi Mohammed ben Youssef in 1953 , the rulers of adjoining Spanish Morocco could not control their gloating satisfaction . Posing as champions of the Arab world , they declared the deposition " illegal , " welcomed Moroccan nationalists from the French zone , closed their eyes to guerrilla raids on the French zone from hideouts in the Rif Mountains . Theoretically , both Moroccos are one country under the Sultan , and Spain has always resented that she holds her zone only as a sort of sublet from the French . If it were not for those nasty French , the Spanish implied broadly , they would give the Moroccans all their hearts desired . While Frenchmen lived in terror of nationalist bombs across the border , Spaniards basked in the sunshine of nationalist favor . <P> France 's sudden restoration of Ben Youssef caught the Spanish with their promises down . When the French pledged Morocco " independence within interdependence , " Spanish spokesmen backtracked hastily , began to talk of the necessity of " going slow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous , " because " we do not wish for the Moroccans something which is repugnant to ourselves . " <P> Last week the zone 's disenchanted nationalists gave Spanish Morocco its first taste of terrorism in years : a bomb burst in a Tetuan cafe , another was hurled at a bus . Demonstrators shouting for " independence and unity " stormed through Arcila . <P> Suddenly , Spain began to talk more kindly of cooperation with France . With a faintly patronizing air , French Resident General Andr Louis Dubois drove over to the Spanish zone for a " courtesy " call on his Spanish counterpart , Lieut . General Rafael Garcia Valino . Dubois ' main concern was to get Spanish cooperation in halting the Rif raids across the border . Garcia Valino seized the opportunity to announce Spain would introduce political reforms to institute " parallel evolution " in its zone . At week 's end , Franco conferred long and late with his Cabinet , authorized a guarded statement promising that Spain would " follow attentively " events in the French zone " with the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legitimate interests of the Spanish nation . " <P> It posed quite a problem for Fascist Franco . As one Spanish observer said : " What are we going to do ? Let them have a parliamentary democracy when we have none here ? Permit them to have a free press when our own papers are censored ? Give the workers economic rights when they are denied in Spain ? No , we ca n't do it . "
