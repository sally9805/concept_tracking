txt All this produces nothing like the almost hourly stimulation of battle felt at the Democratic National Convention last week in Chicago . Leonard W. Hall , Republican National Chairman , has been gaveling the convention into activity at the commodious Cow Palace , which has been host in its time to everything from Liberate to lasso artists . The hum of political talk , however , has dealt not with what keynoter Arthur B. Langlie , Governor of Washington , would be likely to say in his kickoff speech , but whether by any conceivable , or inconceivable , chance Mr. Nixon might not be renominated . Mr. Stassen , who has opened an Eisenhower and Herter headquarters on downtown Market Street , gave his umpteenth press conference Aug. 19 and forecast that President Eisenhower actually would submit to the convention a list of the names of vice-presidential nominees acceptable to him , other names beside that of Mr. Nixon . Associates of Mr. Nixon said they had assurances no such list would be submitted by Mr. Eisenhower . Mr. Stassen countered that there had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican organization , and that there would be some " revaluation " of the Nixon prospects now . Eisenhower Displeased ? On the other hand GOP regulars like Representative Joseph W. Martin , Jr. , of Massachusetts have said emphatically that no candidate other than Mr. Nixon could realistically expect to receive serious consideration . And even Minnesota , where Mr. Stassen was once Governor several long years ago , dealt " Honest Harold " a blow when Senator Edward J. Thye of that state announced that his delegation was practically solid for Mr. Nixon . The vast preponderance of professional delegate sentiment is obviously for Dick Nixon . There are authentic reports from Washington that President Eisenhower has not been at all pleased at the way Mr. Hall and his colleagues virtually sewed up the vice-presidential nomination while he was convalescing at Gettysburg , Pa. , and that this is why Mr. Eisenhower intends to exert a mild influence at the convention toward an ' ' open " contest . Beyond this there are intimations that some members of the Republican New York delegation are worrying lest the invigorated Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority groups in the big cities . They aver that Mr. Nixon is not popular with these minorities . All of this rumble and rumor , however , seems to add up only to the prospect that the convention may , where the vice-presidency is concerned be " open . " That is to say , a number of names can be placed in nomination if anyone wishes to do so . For instance . Mr. Stassen , though not a delegate , could rise to nominate Gov . Christian A. Herter of Massachusetts if he receives unanimous consent from the convention , Nixon ' Satisfactory ' Other vice-presidential candidates likely to merit the approval of President Eisenhower , as named by Mr. Stassen , include : Governor Langlie ; former Gov . Dan Thornton of Colorado ; presidential assistant Sherman Adams : Gov . Theodore R. of Maryland : United Nations Ambassado- Henry Cabot Lodge , Jr. ; ** William F. Knowland of California , and possibly Senator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine . On the other hand , Mr. Eisenhower has said Mr. Nixon would be " entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " delighted " to have him on the ticket . He has not ruled out other names . What seems to have happened is that an effort now has been made by the Republican political high command , with either the approval of Mr. Eisenhower or at his strong insistence , to open up the convention for vice-presidential nominal ions . An " open " convention v.onld mean that any name could be put in nomination , so long as it had the approval of the President . Mr. Nixon has said that the convention should have a free choice . Mr. Hall has said the convention should be " open . " But the Republican command obviously wants a convention which , though " open , " will still be very certain to nominate Mr. Nixon . This it is likely to get , for the party regulars either approve of Mr. Nixon , or regard any move now to replace him as desperately " ill-timed " ? altogether too late . The real difficulty with the Stassen drive to replace Mr. Nixon is that no outstanding Republicans have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Paul G. Hoffman have endorsed Mr. Nixon .
