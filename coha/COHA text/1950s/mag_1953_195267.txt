Salome ( Beckworth Corp. ; Columbia ) tries-with small success-to set the historical record straight on the story of Salome . According to the Biblical version , Princess Salome of Galilee was a willing accomplice in the beheading of John the Baptist because of his preachings against her adulterous mother , Queen Herodias and her stepfather , King Herod . As the movie has it : Salome ( Rita Hayworth ) was just a nice , healthy girl over whom men lost their heads-figuratively rather than literally . And she danced her famous dance of the seven veils not to lure Herod into serving up the Prophet 's head on a platter but merely to distract the King while a handsome Roman commander ( Stewart Granger ) , a secret convert to John 's Christian teachings , tried to free him . <P> Doubtful as history , Salome is just as dubious as screen entertainment . A turgid multimillion-dollar blend of sex , spectacle and religion , it has been directed with a ponderous touch by William Dieterle . Chewing at the Technicolor scenery are Charles Laughton as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evilly scheming Herodias , Alan Badel as a weirdly wild-eyed John the Baptist , and Stewart Granger as an intrepid Roman commander . Actress Hayworth does her best in the dance of the seven veils . With choreography by Valerie Bettis , Rita is the very picture of a Galilean glamour girl in an off-the-shoulder gown by Jean Louis hairdo by Helen Hunt , and make-up by Clay Campbell . She wriggles , writhes and undulates through this predecessor of the modern striptease with such abandon , as she methodically removes as many veils ( six ) as the law and the Breen Office will allow , that moviegoers may come away with the feeling that never before has history been so colorful . <P> I Love Melvin ( MGM ) is a Technicolored song &; dance show with little to offer except the animated presence of Donald O'Connor . Cast as a photographer 's brash assistant whose main job is lugging flashbulbs , O'Connor falls head over dancing heels in love with a pretty Broadway chorine ( Debbie Reynolds ) , and boastfully promises to get her picture on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , photographs of prizefighters , puppies and horses keep appearing on the magazine cover with increasingly monotonous regularity-but never one of the chorine . Does Debbie ever get to be a cover girl ? Does Donald prove that he is no mere flash in the bulb ? Do cinemusicals have happy endings ? <P> In the course of I Love Melvin , pert Debbie Reynolds impersonates a football in a gridiron dance number . Donald O Connor does a tap dance on roller skates and goes through some amusing rapid costume changes in a photographer 's gallery . But the picture leaves O'Connor 's musical-comedy talents largely untapped .
