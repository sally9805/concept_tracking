INTERNATIONAL borothy and Virginia Warren kiss their father48 he is nominated Vice-Presidential candidate . ? ON Election Day last November seventh , certain inexorable forces  --  some of human contrivance , some beyond human control  --  were set into motion in the state of California . On that day , Earl Warren , governor of California , won a third-term victory unprecedented in the history of his state . His margin was such that some political analysts saw in Warren a man conceivably to be reckoned with when the Republican Party chooses its nominee for President in 1952 . In the early morning of Election Day , tragedy hit the Warren household ; the governor 's youngest daughter , Nina , a golden-haired seventeen-year-old , whom the Warrens call Honeybear , was stricken with spinal poliomyelitis . Thus , in the hour of hisgreatest political triumph , Warren was an unhappy man . He and Mrs. Warren went to the bedside of their desperately sick child . All that day and night Earl Warren waited and prayed .

Warren himself was " unavailable " for comment , and the voters knew long before he did that he had been re-elected governor . The happy sequel to the story is that the stricken daughter not only will live but will walk again . Govtour when her father was the Republican vicepresidential nominee ; she is an unspoiled , considerate young woman . Earl , Jr. , just turned twentytwo , is a husky , adventurous member of the junior class of the University of California 's agricultural college at Davis . He plans a career as a stock farmer , but right now he is drilling with the National Guard and expects to go into military service when his call comes .

Finally , there is the " baby , " Bob , sixteen  --  he weighs 160 pounds and already ? comes up to the chin of his strapping father . All the youngsters seem to be happy and well-adjusted . In an **27;4000;TOOLONG family such as the Warrens , it was natural that group consternation should reign for a while when Honeybear came down with polio . The symptoms began to appear four nights before Election Day . On that Friday evening , Honeybear had been a cheer leader for her school , McClatchy High , in a night football game . She had felt a little droopy ? a strange experience for her  --  and her instinct  --  typical of the Warrens  --  was to react against her fatigue by " punching it in the nose . " So she outdid herself in leading the yells for McClatchy with leaps , twists and handsprings . She was a sick youngster when she got home . It was a grim pre-election week end for her parents . The first hopeful diagnosis by doctors was that it might be flu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been three cases of polio at Honeybear 's school , could not shake off the feeling that it might be something worse . On Election Day morning , however , Honeybear 's temperature was down to normal after a peak of 102 , and she pleaded with her parents to follow their usual custom of voting in Oakland , eighty-six miles away . She told them she felt fine . With foreboding , they went off to the polls , after making arrangements so they could be reached by phone all along the route . He Won  --  on an Unhappy Election Day B Y 8:45 A.M. , the Warrens had voted and were having an uneasy breakfast with old friends in Oakland . The telephone rang . " Honeybear 's awfully sick , Mrs. Warren , " said the housekeeper . " She 's in pain and I 've sent for the doctors . She did n't want me to call you , but I thought I 'd better . " When they got home  --  the ride back to Sacramento seemed the longest the Warrens ever had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in extreme pain and hardly knew what was going on . She was paralyzed from the hips down and her abdominal muscles were affected too . The governor and Mrs. Warren with great effort held themselves together , kissed her and petted her , and then tore down the steps to follow the ambulance that took her to Sutter 's Hospital . All day and night the dazed parents were either in the hospital room or outside her door . Their morale dropped as an iron lung was wheeled up , ready to be put into use if her breathing failed . At one point during the day , Honeybear was sufficiently alert to look at her parents and stretch out a hand to them . Slowly and as seriously as if she had been the mother and they the children , she said , " Daddy . . . mother ... you are going to be nervous wrecks . You know , it 's a terrible thing when you think about having ... this polio ... but once you get it , it's'not BO bad . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At this , Governor Warren went quickly out of the room , found a corner to himself , broke down and wept . But soon after the disease hit her Honeybear began to snap back . The paralysis did not spread to the upper regions , as had been dreaded , and it was not necessary to use the iron lung . The doctors made tests and discovered , to everyone 's delight , that the paralysis had left the legs . Twelve days after Honeybear was taken to the hospital the Warrens suffered another blow . Their second daughter , Dorothy , was coming home from a college dance . A heavy fog had set in , and Dorothy 's date was unable to see a car that had stopped at a railroad crossing . There was a collision and Dorothy Was thrown against the dashboard with such force that five ribs were broken . Dorothy was in a walking coma ? she says today she can not remember a thing until she came to , much later , in a hospital  --  but apparently she instinctively told officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take her home before anything else . The governor had gone to bed , planning on an early-morning hunting trip with Bobby , and Mrs. Warren was in the kitchen in her robe making up vacuum bottles of hot chocolate and stacks of sandwiches for the men to take with them . Dorothy came in , still oblivious of what was going on . Mrs. Warren awakened the governor , who jumped up , Swallowed hard , and told the officers to get Dorothy as rapidly as possible to the city-maintained emergency clinic . There was no attempt to get a private doctor for the governor 's daughter or to hush up the news of the accident . In fact , the governor was much disturbed when he was told that the young man driving the car , while giving his own name correctly , had I tried , understandably , to keep the girl 's identity secret . The governor made a special call first thing the next morning to make certain that Dorothy 's name was on the police accident report . At the clinic , X rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five broken ribs . So she was moved into Mercy Hospital , and for the next few weeks Mrs. Warren and the governor had a busy time shuttling between the two hospitals . As things turned out , Honey bear beat Dorothy home by three days . When I visited the room where the youngster is convalescing in the rococo Executive Mansion  --  a relic of the 1870 's which Mrs. Warren has converted from a rundown eyesore into a gracious , well-appointed home  --  Honeybear looked a radiant picture of health . r " She 's just raring to go , " said her nurse . At the moment , Honeybear was bucking for a wheelchair , and already was beginning to proposition her mother about being taken out for rides . A trapeze arrangement to enable her to exercise even better in bed came in the next day , and she was as excited about it as if someone had promised her a diamond ring . As a matter of fact , Mrs. Warren , knowing how the youngster always has admired her diamonds , has taken off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Part of Honey bear 's daily exercise is to take a few steps around her room , supported by the physiotherapist and the nurse . In the hospital , the very first time she tried it , she said to them , " Turn loose a second , please , and let me stand by myself ! " She said it with such intensity that they took their hands away for a moment . She teetered , but she stood . Just before I left Sacramento I saw Honeybear make her awkward , painful circuit of the room . As a group , the first family of California is remarkable . The attractive Mrs. Warren , whose auburn-blond hair is a good deal grayer since the morning Honeybear went to the hospital , has a striking talent for taking care of her family and for staying out of the limelight . She believes firmly that wives of public men should stay in the background . At a California Republican rally in 1946 , the exuberant crowd began yelling for speeches by everyone present . Wives of other political figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd kept chanting what to Mrs. Warren were terrifying words , " We want Nina ! Speech ! Mrs. Warren ! " Earl Warren came to the rescue . He leaped onto a table and held up his arms for silence . " Folks , " he shouted , giving the crowd his famous smile , " I want to let you in on a family secret ! We have a rule in our family . I do the talking in public , and Mrs. Warren does the talking at home . " The crowd roared its approval , let up on its chant , and the color gradually came back to Mrs. Warren 's cheeks . It has n't been many years since Mrs. Warren stopped doing most of her housework , all of her cooking and even the ironing of her husband 's shirts . She did this  --  and still does much of it  --  for several reasons : For one , she likes it . For another , when Warren first was THE WARRENS : WHAT A FAMILY ! ( Continued from Page 19 ) elected governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowance for running the huge , drafty mansion was only $500 a month . The salary and allowance since have been raised , respectively , to $25,000 per annum and $1000 a month . As for the shirts , for a long time no one but Nina Warren had the knack of ironing and starching the governor 's size 17 collars the way he likes them  --  and the governor , an extraordinarily neat man , has been known to use four shirts a day . All seven of the other Warrens , from the governor down , will assure you earnestly that " no one can bake a cake like mother . " A Warren birthday is n't official without a hand-baked Nina Warren devil's-food cake  --  only it takes a minimum of four cakes to go around . Her all-time cake-baking record  --  there was a special party on  --  was seventeen in one day . I once asked Mrs. Warren how she and the governor embarked on their plan for raising children without physical punishment . " Neither of us , " sbe answered , " ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one saying to the other , think we ought to raise the children without spanking , do n't you ? ' " Mrs. Warren says it would make no difference to her how " difficult " a child seemed  --  she " never would punish any youngster by slapping or hitting . I know , " she says , " how children resent harsh or unfair punishment , particularly if it is for breaking a rule that has n't yet been explained to them . I know what it does to a child to be blamed for something he has n't done . " Her technique for dealing with an unruly youngster is subtle . " I do n't say much , " she explains , " but I ' tune out ' on the child . That does not mean that I freeze them , deny them anything or give them any less than their brothers and sisters . In fact , I bend over backwards to see that they get every customary attention , including a bedtime snack and a good-night kiss . " But they sense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite right . I have found it far more effective than threats and spankings . Never , on one of the occasions when I have found it necessary to ' tune out , ' has the youngster gone to sleep without saying , ' Mother , you 're angry with me , are n't you ? ' Then we talk it over ; the child works out for himself or herself what is wrong , and usually comes up with a suggestion for what he or she might do about it . " One thing I never do , " Mrs. Warren continues , " is to punish any of the children by sending them to bed . I 've always wanted them to think of bed as a pleasant place  --  a haven of comfort and safety . When they are ill or injured ? and our active youngsters have had more than their share of cuts and bruises  --  I want them to feel it 's going to he fun to stay in bed for a while . Maybe that 's why Honeybear is so cheerful right now despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen that the children have had special little treats when they go to bed . I see that they have games and their favorite books in bed with them , and I 've let them take their favorite dolls and toys ? even as many as a dozen  --  to bed with them . " There are not too many instances of direct punishment , fot the Warrens more often encourage than curb their youngsters . But , for example , there was the time that Jim , the oldest boy , began cutting Sunday school to slip down to the athletic club and practice his diving . Jim , by the way , who now is married to Margaret ( Maggie ) Jessee , a wellknown California tennis star , and has three sons of his own , is Mrs. Warren 's son by a brief first marriage . His father , Grdver Meyers , died of tuberculosis when Jim was only three weeks old . Jim was six years old when Warren , then the thirty-four-year-old district attorney of Alameda County , married the pretty young widow after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembers . Warren adopted Jim . It was wrong of Jim to play hooky from Sunday school , so his dad took over the disciplining . Warren told Jim that swimming and diving were fine and he was all for them , but that it was more important not to run out on what your parents were expecting you to do . " He asked me what I thought of it , " * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * says Jim , " and first thing you know I was arguing against myself . " Then came the decision as to what the punishment would be . Jim would have to be deprived of something in order to make the lesson felt . " I spoke up , " Jim relates , " and said I guessed that since swimming got me in trouble he ought to stop me from using the pool for a while . ' No , ' said dad , ' swimming is a good thing for you , Jim , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' So we settled for no movies for a month  --  and that was a real punishment , for I loved the movies . But the thing I can understand now is that I came away without feeling I 'd been done wrong or held back from learning something worth while . Punishment or not , I felt dad was a pretty fair and swell guy . " There was also the time the Warrens went on a trip and left the children in charge of Mrs. Warren 's sister . Virginia , who was just a kid then , had picked up some adolescent ideas about elegance . She put on her best frock and went calling on tie neighbors , haughtily informing them that " we have a new maid ? really an excellent servant ? in our family . " Then she went home and told her aunt that , since she was filling in as the maid around the house , it really would be better for auntie to eat her meals in the kitchen . One thing that never has been tolerated in the Warren household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff . Employees in the Executive Mansion are not referred to as " the maid , " " the cook " or " the housekeeper " ? in fact , the word " servant " is taboo . If you work for the Warrens , you 're usually called by your first name and you 're a member of the family . So , when the Warrens returned and learned about Virginia 's little excursion into adolescent drawing-room manners , Father Warren took over . There was no shouting , no threats , no orders . After he had talked pretty plainly for a while , however , Virginia got the idea that she ought to get this thing straightened out . So she retraced her footsteps and apologized to every one of the neighbors . " I was just being show-offy , " she told them . " The new maid really is my Aunt Hannah . " There is n't a trace of snobbery in any of the Warren children today , despite their father 's fame . As youngsters in Sacramento they were driven to school and picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jalopy was being repaired , the driver had to haul them in the governor 's gleaming official limousine . But whenever that happened , the children insisted that the driver drop them and pick them up around the corner from school ; they did n't want to be showing off . Instead of writing , " The Executive Mansion , " as the return address on their personal correspondence , all the children mark their letters unostentatiously with the street address . The children also are pretty square on turning themselves in when they 've done wrong . Virginia , for instance , smoked cigarettes secretly for a long while , then voluntarily reported herself to her mother . Mrs. Warren , " who neither smokes nor drinks , did n't dictate to Virginia on what she should or should n't do , but did point out that , in her opinion , if you had to smoke , there were times and places for it . Virginia , a college graduate , still does n't smoke in public . Earl , Jr. , fudged a little about driving a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about thirteen , though they were n't allowed licenses until they reached the legal age of sixteen . Their parents ' theory is that they 'd rather have their children , whom they know and trust , driving their own cars than riding with youngsters who may be less responsible . Earl found an indulgent household employee who used to let him take the wheel , but then his conscience hurt him and he turned himself in . Same with Bobby  --  he carelessly lost Earl , Jr . ' s , prized fishing rod once , and one of the governor 's aides had to go to a lot of trouble to recover it . But rather than let the aide cover up for him , Bobby , who was only nine at the time , took full blame for it . That 's definitely a Warren trait ; when you make a mistake , you take the rap for it . Another thing Governor and Mrs. Warren have worked hard at is letting the children develop their own personalities and talents . No matter what the hobby or sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the children could convince their parents they were sincerely interested in the project , they got a green light to pursue it . Take Jim , an avid athlete , for instance ; he had a bad arm injury from playing football . When war came , Jim enlisted in the Army , but , because of the old injury , was kept on limited service , which did n't suit him at all . By some legerdemain , he managed a transfer to the Marine Corps and got to the Pacific . There never was one word of suggestion from his parents that he remain on the less hazardous assignment . Or take Earl , Jr . For four years , his particular hobby has been diving unarmed into caves at the bottom of the ocean to hunt octopuses . He began by going down clad in trunks , goggles and feet fins ; now he has graduated to a self-carried oxygen tank which enables him to go down more than 200 feet . It 's all right when you encounter only a little octopus  --  one , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if a big one gets you , you 're in trouble . Earl combines his diving with abalone hunting , which nets him some very substantial summer spending money . The governor and Mrs. Warren had to swallow hard on this underwater business  --  particularly when Earl , Jr. , began getting Bobby , Dotty and Huneybear to go down with him . But all the governor ever told him , once he was satisfied that Earl , Jr. , knew what he was doing , was " Take it easy , son . " Sixteen-year-old Bobby now divides his interests between football and hunting , fishing and deep-sea diving with Earl , Jr . At the age of eleven , however , his real love was his Morgan pony , Porky . Bobby , husky even at eleven , decided to train Porky to compete against Thoroughbreds in jumping contests . This is something a Morgan pony just is n't built for ; though it is a fullSized animal , it does n't have the litheness of a Thoroughbred . The first time Bobby entered Porky in a jumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and riders were auctioned off to spectators willing to take a chance on them ? the auctioneer thought h was a huge joke . Someone bid five cents for Bobby and Porky , and the merry auctioneer knocked them down for a nickel without letting the bidding go any farther . Bobby was so mad that he hardly could sit in his saddle . But he Went home and , without bellyaching to anybody , began training Porky in earnest . He trained more than 100 pounds Off the weight of the pony and got him so he could jump with the best of them . Then he entered Porky in another Pool  --  putting up twenty dollars he had earned himself as an entrance fee . This time Bobby and Porky were auctioned off for six dollars  --  the buyer being a fellow by the name of Earl Warren , Sr. , who was sitting in the stands . Bobby and Porky licked every Thoroughbred in the pool to win a grand prize of eighty-three dollars for his father . " Here , son , " the proud governor told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half for you and half for Porky . " The governor was in the stands once ? Mrs. Warren , although she wo n't discourage the kids , just wo n't go to watch them ride  --  when Porky got obstreperous and threw Bobby right at the hurdle . Bobby hit the bar with his head and was knocked out cold . When they revived him , he got that grim look on his face which his brothers and sisters know so well , got back on Porky and made him take the jump . The governor , of course , is very much in the political limelight at present as a result of his spectacular victory over Jimmy Roosevelt in the recent gubernatorial campaign . In California 's entire 100 years of history as a state , only two other men have been elected to two consecutive terms as governor  --  and one of these was back in the early days when it was only a two-year term . Warren now has been elected to three fouryear terms in a row . In 1946 , by crossfiling in the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominations . In the 1950 primaries , Warren came within approximately 250,000 votes of beating the bearer of the magic Rooseveltname in the primary of Jimmy 's own party . Then , in the general election , although the Democrats had registered approximately 1,117,000 more voters than the Republicans did , Warren beat Roosevelt by approximately 1,128,000 votes . Also Warren this time carried all fifty-eight California counties . The sweep was so complete that Earl C. Behrens , of the San Francisco Chronicle , dean of California 's political editors , noted that Warren 's victory " was more impressive percentage-wise " than the victories of those three presidential hopefuls , Dewey , Taft and Duff . " Even Eastern Republicans who want to pick a ticket from their own section can not laugh off the tremendous vote piled up by Warren in winning the unprecedented third term , " Behrens wrote . Many of Warren 's friends think it was a mistake for him to accept the Republican nomination in 1948 as Thomas E. Dewey 's running mate . Warren himself never has gone on the record explicitly  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sportsmanship to do so  --  as to how he felt about his 1948 role . However , I had the opportunity to observe him closely while traveling with him for more than three weeks during that campaign . On the basis of a number of long , frank talks at that time and more recently , it is my deduction that he disliked his 1948 role from start to finish . Warren is above all a man of independence , and he never has had his heart in any situation where he can not run his own show as he sees best , perfectly willing to take the consequences if his judgment is wrong . I do not think he ever relished the idea of a Throttlebottom role . I further think he regarded the Republican campaign strategy ? popularly described before the 1948 Dewey debacle as " lofty " and " on a high plane " ? as just plain , dumb pussyfooting . Warren , who will be sixty years old next March nineteenth ? six years and ten months younger than President Truman  --  will not talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization , and it is highly unlikely that he is going to start flitting around the country corraling 1952-convention votes . He also is realistic enough to know his independence will count against him . Many GOP moguls regard him as a political maverick , and even some California Republicans are mad about the way he selects Democrats for state jobs if he thinks they have more ability than available Republicans . However , ' 52 is still a good way off , and it is entirely possible that prevailing circumstances at that time might make an independent such as Warren , with a strong reputation for integrity and for putting the country 's welfare above partisan politics , highly attractive to the GOP . If they select him they will have a candidate who makes it plain where he startis . At the 1948 Republican convention , for instance , he said in polite but prophetic terms th4 same thing that Harry Truman later trumpeted with such success  --  namely , that the Republican-controlled 80th Congress had n't done much . At the 1950 Governors ' Conference , he asserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the GOP to become saddled with . And , in Sacramento recently , while discussing with me how the recent Republican victory might affect future GOP policies , Earl Warren said , " There is no such a thing in this country as a mandate to turn back the clock .
