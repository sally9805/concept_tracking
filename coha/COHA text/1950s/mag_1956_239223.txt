Supersonic speed has brought a new hazard for jet-plane pilots : shooting themselves down with their own gunfire . Last week the Navy told how Test Pilot Tom Attridge was trying out the 20-mm. guns of a Grumman F11F-i fighter off Long Island . He put the airplane into a dive , speeded up to 880 m.p.h. and fired a four-second burst ( about 70 rounds ) . Then he went into a steeper dive and fired another burst . As the last bullets left his guns , something struck and shattered his windshield . Pilot Attridge thought he had run down a bird . He headed for the Grumman base at Peconic River , but before he got there , his engine died . He crash-landed half a mile short of the field and broke a leg and three vertebrae . <P> Examination of the airplane proved that Pilot Attridge had hit no bird ; he had overtaken and run down the fire from his own guns . A nonexplosive 20-mm. bullet ( used in practice ) had gone through his windshield . Another had hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the projectiles had been explosive , Pilot Attridge would not have got home alive . <P> Navy experts explained that the bullets left the guns at 3,000 ft. per sec . Their speed through the air ( muzzle velocity plus airplane 's speed ) was about 4,300 ft. per sec. , but friction quickly slowed them , and gravity pulled them toward the earth . If the airplane had kept its original course , it would have passed by them , but its steepened dive made it intersect their down-curving path . When it hit them , they must have been moving so slowly that the airplane overtook them at a good fraction of its own air speed , which was about as fast as many a newly fired bullet .
