A CENTURY OF BRITISH MONARCHY ( 274 pp. ) - Hector Bolitho-Longmans , Green ( $6 ) . <P> When Queen Victoria opened the Great Exhibition in 1851 , she was one of 20 reigning European sovereigns . The number has now dropped to seven , * but , as Hector Bolitho says in A Century of British Monarchy , " the influence of the monarchy in Britain has remained as strong as ever . " Bolitho looks for the sources of this strength and finds a big one in the energetic character of the royal family itself . <P> His book , which includes a fine gleaning of drawings and photographs , is chiefly a series of informal personality sketches . Queen Victoria is wisely allowed to characterize herself in her gushy , gossipy , bossy letters , Prince Albert in his steady , sensible ones . <P> The reign of Edward VII , the rakish son of this sober pair , is wittily described in the imaginary diary of a putative secretary to the King-though it passes over in silence what must have been the domestic travails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the royal family in two world wars is given due credit , and the constitutional crisis that dethroned Edward VIII gets a judicious , white-gloved examination . Bolitho concludes that , although the tasks of kingship were apparently " intolerable " to Edward , " as heir to the throne he was the noblest and most devoted Prince of Wales in our history . " <P> Author Bolitho , a New Zealand-born journalist , should be as familiar with his subject as any living writer . A Century of British Monarchy is his twelfth book on the members of the House of Windsor . <P> <P> * Belgium 's Baudouin , Denmark 's Frederik IX , Britain 's George VI , Greece 's Paul , The Netherlands ' Juliana , Norway 's Haakon VII , Sweden 's Gustaf VI .
