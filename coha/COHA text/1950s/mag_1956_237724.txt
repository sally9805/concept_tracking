In his moment of triumph , Nominee Adlai Stevenson announced a decision that gave the 1956 Democratic Convention its highest , wildest moments : he left the nomination of a vice-presidential candidate entirely to the will and whim of the delegates without a word about his personal choice . <P> The backers of Massachusetts ' Senator John Kennedy , convinced that they could not get a flat endorsement from Adlai , had been trying for three days to persuade Stevenson to throw the nomination wide open . Stevenson finally gave in to their main argument : that the Democrats might be able to stir up more trouble for their favorite campaign target , Vice President Nixon , by inviting a sudden-death competition in their own ranks . Immediately after the convention nominated him , Stevenson went to a two-room suite ( decorated with prints of American birds , e.g. , the black-billed cuckoo and the boat-tailed grackle ) in the Stock Yard Inn , next to the convention amphitheater , to talk over his decision with Democratic leaders . <P> " If He Does n't Pick . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jim Finnegan ( see box ) , and his old political sponsor , Chicago 's Jacob Arvey . Their private discussion of the pros and cons of Adlai 's open-race plan floated over an open transom : <P> FINNEGAN : They 'll say he lacks decisiveness . <P> ARVEY : It 's a very courageous thing to do . <P> FINNEGAN : It 's the first time it 's ever been done . I talked to Larry Spivak <P> Meet the Press , and he says we underrate the imaginativeness of the American people . <P> ARVEY : Dave presumably Pittsburgh 's Mayor David Lawrence does n't like it . <P> FINNEGAN : Well , suppose he does n't pick Kennedy . Then the Catholics are against him . If he does n't pick Kefauver , then he loses all of his people . If he does n't pick Humphrey , it does n't make too much difference . <P> Brimstone Words . When Adlai arrived at the inn , he faced angry opposition in the formidable persons of House Speaker Sam Rayburn and Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson-who share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide-open convention would give the nod to Estes and his primary-built organization . Rayburn and Johnson used brimstone words while protesting that , in giving the convention its choice , Stevenson would seem to be abdicating his responsibility . People might think that Adlai would have equal trouble making up his mind about " whether some night to use the Seventh Fleet . " <P> But Adlai was adamant ( he specifically vetoed only Missouri 's Senator Stuart Symington , who , he said , has yet to make a positive Senate record ) , and he went off to the amphitheater to launch the Democrats on a night of politicking .
