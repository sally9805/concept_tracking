Bowing to the long-standing demands of the powerful U.S. independent oil producers , President Eisenhower last week told big oil companies to slash crude-oil imports " voluntarily " to a level 10% below their average imports from 1954 to 1956 . This would cut current U.S. imports of foreign oil by about 20% . If the companies do not go along with the request-and three other similar pleas since 1955 have only been moderately successful-the Administration threatens mandatory Government controls . Grudgingly , most of the oil importers promised to cut back rather than risk controls . But oilmen will probably suffer less than the U.S. consumer . Charged Vermont 's Republican Senator Ralph Flanders : " The quotas will surely result in a price rise in the near future-in fact , that is the purpose of the order . " <P> President Eisenhower ordered the quotas-despite his free-trade convictions-as a result of an Office of Defense Mobilization report that " the nation 's security " was being endangered by the flood of cheap foreign oil . Crude imports have risen by 500,000 bbl. a day in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production has gone up 1,100,000 bbl . But crude imports were scheduled to hit a record 1,200,000 bbl. daily this month , or 16% of U.S. production ( v. the 12% limit set by the quotas ) . As a result of the foreign competition , Texas producers are selling about $1,000,000 less oil a day than they did in May , will work their wells an alltime low of 13 days this month . The quotas are also intended to encourage new exploration in the U.S. This year , for only the second time in its history , the U.S. will probably wind up with lower reserves than it had on Jan. 1 . <P> But the quotas pleased almost no one . Tidewater Oil Co. , which only recently began buying heavily abroad , condemned them as unfair and discriminatory against " new importers . " Tidewater 's imports will be slashed from a planned 84,600 bbl. daily to only 34,200 because it imported little in the base 1954-56 period . Even the domestic producers who will benefit most from the quotas called them too little and too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission , which controls 45% of U.S. output : " There is every logical reason why the voluntary plan will break down . No voluntary plan ever worked . "
