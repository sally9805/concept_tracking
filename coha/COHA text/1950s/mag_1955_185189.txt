On a black , rainy night last week , 300 heavily armed Israeli infantrymen converged stealthily on a network of five Syrian border strongpoints along the northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee . One assault party landed from small boats , conceivably near the place where Jesus stood when He called to Peter and Andrew to abandon their nets . A second column forded the icy River Jordan and advanced by land up the coast . At the zero hour , a Syrian sentry cried out : " Min hada ( Who is there ) ? " And the night answered with fire . The Israelis fell upon the 200 men in the strongpoints with grenades and Tommy guns at point-blank range . <P> The Syrians were caught so completely by surprise that three of their officers were killed before they could get up from a card game . The Syrians fought back savagely , nevertheless . The battle raged for two hours in and around their concrete pillboxes , barbed wire and connecting trenches , until they were finally overwhelmed . The Israelis then methodically destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 30 prisoners . Said a tired , mud-spattered but jubilant Israeli soldier : " We gave them a lesson they wo n't forget for ages . " <P> Ulterior Motives . United Nations observers provisionally put the casualties at 41 Syrian dead , including a number of civilians who lived in a farming settlement in the combat zone . Cost to the Israelis : six dead , ten wounded . <P> The Israeli government made no bones of the fact that it had ordered the attack . Its official excuse for its aggression was that it was in retaliation for sporadic Syrian firing at Israeli fishermen in the Sea of Galilee . This was plainly only part of the story : not a single Israeli fisherman has been killed for a year ; incidents on the Sea of Galilee make little stir even in the Israeli press . A likelier explanation was an attempt to convince the Syrians that their new military pact with Egypt might be more of a liability than an asset ; and additionally to scare neighboring Lebanon out of joining the pact . <P> Shocked Friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends were shocked , especially in the U.S. Senator Herbert H. Lehman of New York , speaking to 18,000 people at an Israeli bond-drive meeting in Madison Square Garden , warned Israel to " show restraint . " The New York Times called the border raid " deplorable . " The incident appeared likely to delay , if not to block , a favorable reply to Israel 's request for U.S. arms to match Communist shipments to Egypt . <P> At a special session of the U.N . Security Council , ten nations , including both the U.S. and the Soviet Union , expressed sympathy for the Syrians . In Cairo , Premier Nasser talked of going to war against Israel , in the event of similar forays in the future against either Syria or Egypt .
