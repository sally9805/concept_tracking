British Publisher Lord Beaverbrook has traveled far and fast since he left his boyhood home in New Brunswick , Canada , half a century ago . But he has never forgotten the folks at home , has showered them with such gifts as a park , a skating rink , a set of chimes and a 12,000-volume library . Last week Canadians got their first look at the Beaver 's latest gift : 80 paintings from the collection that will be turned over to New Brunswick next year , along with a new museum to house it . <P> Last week 's exhibition was mainly devoted to 200 years of British and Canadian painting , plus a portrait by Fragonard , who , the Beaver explains , " would have been French Canadian if he 'd been born on the other side . " But the most intriguing exhibit of the show was a series of oil sketches of Winston Churchill , never before shown to the public , which were done in preparation for Graham Sutherland 's controversial portrait , presented by Parliament to its hero last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the case with the presentation portrait , * Sutherland 's preparatory sketches were apt to please the critics who think painting should be true-to-art ( by fulfilling certain " laws " for what makes a good picture ) and displease the majority who feel that painting should be true-to-life ( in the sense of showing what everyone can see for himself ) . <P> Churchill 's first question to the artist was : " Are you going to paint me as a tiger or a cherub ? " Had Sutherland tried to catch something of both , he might have got results . Instead he took the easier course of choosing a single dramatic aspect-the tiger . He got nine short sittings in which to bag it . His studies on view last week showed a robed tiger in the Order of the Garter , a cigar-chomping tiger , a tiger weary unto death , and a fat but hungry tiger . Each clearly caught a mood . But by concentrating on the tiger , each missed the complex man . <P> <P> *Which has been consigned to the cellar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
