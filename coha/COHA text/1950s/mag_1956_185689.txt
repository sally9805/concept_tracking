When Felix Berrios , the Bishop of San Felipe , added up in his mind the scandals touched off by the parish priest of Catapilco , they made an astonishing total . <P> There was , for a starter , the charge of threatened arson . One night not long after Padre Antonio Zamorano took over the parish in 1942 , his flock , mostly peasants who lived and worked on neighboring estates , came to the church in tearful anger . A landlord , annoyed by one of his farmhand tenants , had refused to pay any of them for their work that week . The priest , whose life until then had been the unharried existence of a Catholic school teacher of algebra , Latin and Greek , was shocked . " Is weeping all you propose to do ? " he roared at his parishioners . " Let 's teach that man a lesson . " He there upon organized a torchlight parade that marched round and round the landlord 's house . The landlord paid the wages , but he called the parade a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After that the landlords gave less and less to Padre Zamorano 's church , and that led to the incident of the gambling party . Right in the churchyard , the peasants played roulette , held a raffle , drank wine and danced ; Padre Zamorano himself pounded the piano and sang . The proceeds , fortunately , were substantial and went to support Catapilco 's school , founded by Zamorano . <P> Later there was the case of assault-the day the priest , armed with a hammer , chased a quack healer out of town . And a case of battery-the day Zamorano beat up a knife-brandishing thug . Worst of all , there was a political scandal . <P> It seemed to Padre Zamorano that the main problem of his flock was its poverty , which he blamed on the 15-a-day wages paid by the landlords . " The villagers can not pray on an empty stomach , " he insisted , and he sought a political solution . He persuaded his parishioners not to sell their votes to the landlords and urged them to register . At length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked a peasants ' candidate to represent the village on the township council . The candidate 's name : Padre Zamorano . <P> Victory at the Polls . Stridently , the landlords appealed to the bishop . " That priest is a social agitator , " said Daniel Perez , whose family has held the same land since the Spanish conquest . The bishop took heed . " If you run as a candidate , you will be suspended , " he warned the priest . Zamorano-torn between his superior and his backers-decided to run . He won , last month , by 196 to 8 . <P> " Zamorano is a very good man , " the bishop admitted , but his warning was no idle threat . Last week the people of Catapilco held an angry testimonial meeting to back Zamorano ; then , even angrier , they staged a one-day protest strike . The governor had to send ten fully armed carabineros to keep order . All protest failed . Padre Zamorano was duly dismissed as parish priest of Catapilco .
