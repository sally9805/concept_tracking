Maria Bertha Hertogh was five years old when the Japanese soldiers took her mother &; father away from Bandung , Java , where papa Adriaanus Hertogh was a sergeant in The Netherlands East Indies army . Bertha was too young to remember just how it happened , but while she was staying at the home of Che Aminah , a Malay woman known to her parents , the rest of the family disappeared into prison camp . <P> The war years passed . Che Aminah loved the girl , gave her the Moslem name Nadra , moved with her to a jungle village north of Singapore . After VJ , the Hertoghs were repatriated to Holland . As best they could , they tried to find Che Aminah and their lost daughter , finally found them last May . Then they ran into fierce emotional barriers . Che Aminah insisted that mama Hertogh had given her Bertha . The girl , now 13 years old and brought up as a Moslem , did not want to leave her foster home . <P> The Hertoghs brought suit in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rescue the " jungle girl . " While lawyers argued , Bertha was married to a young ( 22 ) Moslem schoolmaster , Inche Mansur Abadi ; since she had passed the age of puberty , the marriage was proper under Moslem law . <P> Early this month , the Singapore Supreme Court ruled that Bertha , Dutch by nationality and Roman Catholic by baptism , should be returned to her parents . By British law , she was under the age of consent and therefore her marriage to Mansur was annulled . The girl bride wept over the verdict . " I am a Moslem , " she wailed .

" , stoning and cudgeling Europeans and Eurasians , overturning automobiles , driving whites into terrified hiding . Singapore 's Malay police seemed to have no heart to restrain their coreligionists . British and Gurkha troops , with bayonets and riot shields , barred the mob from a march on the Convent of the Good Shepherd , four miles outside the city , where Bertha and mama Hertogh waited for a plane to Holland . There the girl doffed her Moslem veil for European dress , tried to remember her Dutch , fondled a doll , told her mother : " It 's hard having two mothers . I love you , and I love Aminah . " <P> After three days , Singapore came under control again . Scores of demonstrators were in jail , and seething Moslem leaders vowed to carry on the legal fight for Bertha 's return to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep it going .
