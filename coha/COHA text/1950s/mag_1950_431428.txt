 | It is estimated that about 70 percent of all adults are sensitive to poison ivy . And now that summer is on its way , we should learn all there is to know about it : what precautions should be taken to prevent it ; how it should be treated the moment symptoms appear . Poison ivy can cause a condition known as contact dermatitis ? a skin infection brought about as a result of external contact . There are countless substances and literally thousands of other plants ? poison sumac is the next worse offender ? responsible for contact dermatitis . The skin eruptions may be merely unpleasant or they may be so severe that hospital care is required . Medical science admittedly has a great deal to learn about contact dermatitis . Immunity and susceptibility are curious and uncertain phenomena . For instance , some people never suffer a moment 's discomfort from poison ivy ; others apparently are safe from it only when locked up during the summer in an air-conditioned apartment . Certain substances are irritants , but they do not irritate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a person has been exposed to the substance for a long time , however , his skin becomes sensitized . There must be repeated exposure before a reaction takes place . For this reason , some people who believe they are immune to poison ivy suddenly find themselves victims of an unexpected outbreak . Poison ivy lurks thickly in every state except California and Nevada . It is a pretty plant , glossy green in the summer and vivid orange or scarlet in the fall . It grows either as an erect , bushy shrub or as a vine that trails along the ground or climbs and winds its leaves around tree trunks . You will find it along the edge of woods , on roadsides , around fences or hedges or shrubbery ? almost anywhere . It thrives in deep shade and moist soil ; and it flourishes in the dry soil of the most exposed hillsides . It rambles over rock walls and wooden fences . It climbs posts and houses along with English ivy or Virginia creeper . Poison ivy seems to be impervious to insects and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it is not always easy to recognize , for the leaf forms vary from plant to plant and even on the same plant . It has , however , one uniform characteristic : its trifoliolate leaves . The old saying " Leaflets three , let it be " may cause you to suspect other harmless shrubs , but you wo n't go wrong if you heed that advice . Moreover , you will notice that only one of the three-parted leaves leads off from each node onto the stem . Not all poison-ivy plants have flowers or fruit , but some do . Therefore , beware of a pretty cream-colored or white waxy fruit . The skin irritant of poison ivy is a substance called " urushiol . " It is found in all parts of the plant , including the roots and the fruit . It is especially abundant in the sap , so the danger from ivy poisoning is greatest in spring and summer and least in late autumn and winter . As poison ivy is virulent , a very little of it can cause a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture , garden tools , or even on the door handles or steering wheel of your car , it remains there . Your dog may go through a patch of poison ivy and carry the poison material to your home . The smoke from burning poison ivy may cause a highly irritating inflammation . Even motorists who have passed quickly through such smoke have been affected . Contact with @#  | poison-ivy material on objects other than the plant itself does not end in trouble for everyone , and reactions may not be severe . But you can not be sure about that ; everyone is different ? and different at varying times . There is only one reassuring factor : Ivy poisoning is not transmitted from one person to another . If you are susceptible to poison ivy and your skin comes in contact with the plant , your reaction to it will become evident very quickly . Some people respond to it after a few hours ; most people develop a rash after a day or so . Seldom do more than 3 days elapse between exposure and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for a week or more . THE first symptom is itching or burning , which gets worse as the poisoned area becomes more inflamed . You may notice only redness and swelling , but the chances are you will soon have blisters about the size of pinheads . They may or may not spread until they join and become big , running blisters . In the course of time , with or without treatment , the inflammation subsides , the eruption dries , and the old skin peels off and reveals new skin . Ivy poisoning is a selflimiting disease that lasts from 1 to 3 weeks or longer , depending on its severity . Usually that is all there is to it . It is not fatal , but it will make you extremely uncomfortable . Sometimes , however , ivy poisoning may become serious . If you scratch the area , the lesions may get infected . You may suffer from abscesses , enlarged glands fever , and other symptoms . Dermatologists say the condition comes on the surface of the skin as a result of direct contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the skin , not in the blisters ; but this is not true in every case . Under any circumstances , scratching the blisters is undesirable ; it may cause infection even if it does not spread the poison ivy . When you notice the first symptoms of ivy poisoning , see your doctor . He may be able to avert a severe case by some fairly simple remedies . Do n't try home treatment ; people tend to put too many medications on poison ivy and do not give it a chance to heal . The best single prescription is ordinary calamine lotion , some of which is now made with menthol or phenol , which relieves itching . The doctor also may prescribe cold compresses of ordinary salt water ; . he will suggest that you moisten some old sheeting and apply it to the affected areas . A few years ago , doctors gave injections to treat poison ivy . Now dermatologists feel that at best the injections are useless and at worst , if the patient has very sensitive skin , they make the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used on an active case ; if there is any poison ivy still on the skin , the grease will spread it . The doctor may , however , give you an antihistamine to take by mouth , to relieve the itching . You have to be cautious about this , to see whether or not it makes you sleepy or has any other adverse effect . Toward the end of the attack , an antihistamine salve may also relieve the itch . The main thing is to soothe the tissues , avoid scratching , and give the skin a chance to heal . The doctor @#  | may prescribe a sedative so that you get I some sleep and wo n't scratch a great deal during the night . The compulsive scratching caused by poison ivy prevents healing and may cause infection . Therefore , the doctor may tell you to keep the affected areas covered . Less damage will be done if you absent-mindedly scratch through your clothes than if you dig into the blisters with your fingernails . Some dermatologists use a more drastic approach . They start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution to tannic acid . They prescribe a " shake " lotion to be applied during the intervals when the wet dressings are not on the skin . Many of these lotions , most of which contain zinc oxide , are in general use . The doctor prescribes the one he feels will be most helpful in treating the individual patient . Sometimes the dermatologist uses X-ray treatment to abort an attack of ivy poisoning . Such treatment must be given only by a skin specialist , not a general practitioner or even a radiologist , for it involves a highly selective dosage and a good deal of experience with poison ivy . In the worst cases relief is obtained by lying in a soda-and-starch bath for half an hour at a time , twice daily . Even if the doctor does not see a case of poison ivy until it has become very severe , his approach is much the same . If , however , the skin has become infected , he treats the infection with penicillin , or some other antibiotic preparation . ALTHOUGH even the most acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously much more satisfactory to prevent it than to cure it . The problem of preventing poison ivy has concerned people for a long time . The horse-and-buggy doctor coped with it long before dermatology or any other medical specialty developed . Physicians and laymen alike have noticed , for instance , that quite frequently a person has 1 or 2 severe attacks in the early spring and then is less sensitive and may have no more trouble the rest of the summer . On the other hand , some people have several outbreaks , each progressively worse , during the same season . Everybody tries to do something about prevention . Farmers who know they are susceptible sometimes chew poison-ivy leaves to try to establish an immunity , for the inside of the mouth does not react much , if at all . Many doctors recommended taking the extract by mouth for 3 or 4 months before the poison-ivy season began . Dermatologists have tried to desensitize patients by means of a vaccine . Two or 3 weekly injections were given well ahead of the time the susceptible patient planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this subject was undertaken at the United States Military Academy , at West Point . The cadets were divided into 3 groups . The first group was made up of 33 cadets who had spent the previous summer at Camp Buckner , an area thick with poison ivy , and had suffered from attacks of the plant poisoning . Twentyone of them were inoculated and 12 were not . The result was that 66.6 percent of the cadets who received the injections developed poison ivy , and 83.4 percent of the uninoculated boys were affected . The second group consisted of 36 cadets who spent the summer at Camp Buckner . All except 2 had had poison  | ivy before , and all of them were inoculated . During their 8 weeks at camp , 50 percent suffered from poison ivy ? and the victims included the 2 boys who never had had ivy poisoning before ! The third group , 21 upperclassmen , were inoculated before they went to spend the summer on leave , on duty at West Point , at Camp Buckner , or on various trips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoagland , Chief of Medical Service at the Station Hospital , who conducted this research , published his report and his conclusion in the New England Journal of Medicine . He stated : " A study conducted under relatively controlled conditions showed that although men in an uninoculated group had a slightly higher percentage of dermatitis than their associates who had received previous inoculations , the incidence in the latter group was too great to warrant use of preventive inoculations . " It is believed that previously favorable reports are largely based on inadequate exposure to offending plants or inadequate numbers of subjects in a control group , or both . " YOU can , however , take steps to avoid contact with the poison-ivy material . Keep your skin well covered while you are walking or working in an area where the plant is growing . Take off your clothes carefully , to avoid touching any cloth or leather that might have come in contact with the poison ivy and so become contaminated . If possible , immediately put your clothes in a washing machine , with hot water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your bare skin , or if you touch it with a glove and then pass your gloved hand across your face , scrub the area vigorously with soap and water at once . You absolutely must wash thoroughly and immediately . After about 5 minutes , no amount of soap and water will be of any use . Carbon tetrachloride or kerosene or some such good solvent , as in 1 cleaning fluid , may be used to wash away the poison material . Be sure to keep it ! away from your eyes . You can take a little longer to get from the plant to the kerosene or solvent , for it is slightly more effective than soap and water . But you must not waste many minutes . They count . The best of all possible preventives is to stay away from poison ivy . The practical measures are watching out for the plant when you are off your own premises and getting rid of it in your garden or on your farm . Poison ivy can be killed by grubbing it out or applying chemical herbicides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single treatment kills all the leaves and about nine tenths of the roots . Unfortunately , some of the most effective of these chemicals also kill other plants ; so if the poison ivy is intermingled with beautiful or valuable shrubs or trees or flowers , it must be pulled out by hand if you want to prevent damage to other plants . However , there are a number of chemical sprays that can be used with a minimum of damage . For instance , ammonium sulfamate , which is now on the market under a number of proprietary names , is especially useful against poison ivy . It is not dangerous to use under ordinary conditions , and is neither harmful to the soil nor inflammable . It should be sprayed on the leaves until they are wet but not @#  | dripping . They begin to wilt in 24 hours and die in about a week . You may have to use it 2 or 3 times , to eradicate any new growth . Another weed-killer is 2,4-D , which is one of the so-called " plant hormones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your garden supply house which type is best for your purposes . These chemical sprays can be used with murderous results to the plant when it is in full leaf ? from the first of June until the middle of August . After that , the plant becomes dormant , and sprays are ineffective . The best results are obtained when the soil is moist but not wet and when the chemical is applied in the morning or late in the afternoon , when the air is moist and cool . You can not rely on just 1 application . Give it 2 or 3 or even 4 " follow-up " treatments at intervals of from 2 to 8 weeks , to make sure it does not revive . It is an obvious conclusion that preventive measures are touch and go ; you can not always avoid poison ivy . You can not be forever on the lookout for it , nor can you spray 46 states . When you come in contact with the plant , let 's hope you are not a long way from soap and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of poison ivy , the doctor usually can make you comfortable , assist in resolving the dermatitis , and prevent your becoming seriously ill . Much is still to be learned of the processes of the cells in the skin . Basic research in dermatology is now under way in many institutions . For example , the Colleges of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania , Cornell University , the University of Chicago , Johns Hopkins , and others are investigating these reactions in their laboratories . So many people are victims of this and other skin complaints that dermatology is a most important medical specialty . We can hope for the future . For the present , keep away from poison ivy , get rid of the plant , and go promptly to the doctor if you become infected . And keep your chin up . Even the worst case of poison ivy comes to an end !
