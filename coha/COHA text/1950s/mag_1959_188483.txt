The drab British factory towns dominated so long by " dark , Satanic mills " have a striking new landmark : the government-maintained school . More than 4,000 new buildings have risen in the last decade . They are telling symptoms of a quiet revolution wrought by the historic Education Act of 1944 . Under the act , British schooling ceased to be an upper-class privilege . Today any child mentally able to make the grade is entitled to a free secondary and university education , a situation unthinkable in caste-bound Britain before World War II . <P> One out of two Britons still ends his formal schooling at 15 , when compulsory attendance stops . But so many more are staying on that university enrollment has doubled since 1939 , with a 19% rise since 1954 alone . " At least 20% of my students have some real ambition for a profession , " says a London primary school headmistress . " Before the war , hardly a single one would have presumed to think so far above his station . " Says a London milkman : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' as , I would n't be just a milkman , not bleedin ' likely . " <P> Eleven Plus . But the lofty dream is still far from perfection . Last week , as 7,000,000 children trooped back to classes , flaws in the system loomed as a talking point in Britain 's impending election . Both Conservatives and Laborites promise to build more schools , provide more teachers ; the Conservatives talk in terms of a $960 million program . The school system can use that much and more . One out of ten rural schools in England is still lit by gas lamps ; science facilities are woefully inadequate . After 15 years of work , teachers get a maximum salary of $2,800 . Even more vexing is that unexpected injustice , the dreaded " eleven-plus " exam , which was set up in 1944 as the fairest way to channel children into secondary schools geared to their abilities . <P> The exam is mandatory for every child just past the age of eleven , except for those headed for the public schools such as Eton or Harrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IQ test ) ruthlessly splits youngsters into three groups . The top 20% go to respected pre-university grammar schools ; the mechanically minded 4% go to good technical schools . The rest are packed off to low-status secondary modern schools , many convinced that they are failures . The effect is to demoralize the whole system . <P> Rather than see their children marked as second-rate material , many middle-class parents rush to the prestigious public schools ( costing up to one-third of their incomes ) . In turn , standards in the secondary modern schools are falling , which makes it even tougher on the children of less prosperous parents . Noted the London Times recently : " A mood of disquiet , and even of neurosis , runs wide and deep across the country . "
