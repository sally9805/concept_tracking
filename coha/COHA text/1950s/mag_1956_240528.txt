As Communist heroes go these days , a slim , hatchet-faced Hungarian army lieutenant named Sandor Iharos is a singular exception . For one thing , he is not a Communist Party member . All he knows about Marxism , he says , he learned by rote in school . And as a soldier he fights strictly from a desk . All Sandor really has to do is run , and he does that so well that he now holds five world records ( from 1,500 to 5,000 meters ) . In sports-happy Hungary , excitement boils any time he shucks his sweat pants and gets to work , for Sandor is the star of a small , gaunt band of five trackmen* whom Hungarians confidently expect to win them third place in the 1956 Olympic Games at Melbourne , Australia . <P> Many experts outside Hungary concede that Sandor &; Co. , given a little help from some less talented trackmen , will not disappoint their countrymen : Hungary may be a small onion in the international goulash of sport , but it is a country with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronounced sheer ) , commissar of the track and field section of the sports council of the Ministry of Culture : " We train . That is our secret . " <P> Come April showers , August heat waves , fall fogs or winter blizzards , the trackmen pull on spikes and practice every day of the year , and always amid a gaggle of trainers . High-speed sprints , then intervals of jogging , then high-speed sprints , hour after hour , mile after mile , make up their " interval training " program , give them the steel-legged , leather-lunged stamina of champions . <P> The rare moments of freedom from the strict regimen come , strangely , at the table . Breakfast-eaten usually in state-subsidized clubs or officers ' messes-is a souped-up repast of coffee , rolls and hefty portions of eggs and ham . Lunch provides plenty of soup , meat and vegetables , topped off with the sweet desserts , e.g. , palaczinta , so popular in Hungary . Suppers are generally light , but no one frowns on wines or beer . " We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir . " It does n't go with the Hungarian character . " <P> " It is possible , " Runner Iharos once said in a rare reach for the party line , " that ideology also helps in a psychological way , but the real answer is in training . " There is , he was frank to admit , one other advantage that the hard-running Hungarians can boast over their capitalist competitors : no senseless squabbles over the difference between amateur and pro . Said he : " We have no professionals here . There are only amateurs . All athletes are workers . " <P> <P> *The others : Second Lieut . Laszlo Tabori , 24 , who shares the 1,500-meter record with Iharos ; Captain Istvan Rozavolgyi , 26 , 2,000-meter record holder ; Textile Factory Worker Jozsef Kovacs , 29 , who has tied the world record at 10,000 meters ; Budapest Fireman Lajos Szentgali , 23 , 800-meter specialist .
