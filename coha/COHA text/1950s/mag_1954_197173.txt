Cyprus , a strategically situated island in the eastern Mediterranean , is a place that has been denied even the long-term hope of independence . The British , anxious to strengthen it as a Middle Eastern base now that Suez has gone , fortnight ago classified Cyprus as one of those parts of their empire which will never be allowed to go free .

Henceforth , Enosis agitation on Cyprus will be punished as seditious . <P> <P> In Athens the Greek government cheered on the Cypriots .
