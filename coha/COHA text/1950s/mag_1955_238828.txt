While all Britain talked about Princess Margaret 's romance with 40-year-old R.A.F. Group Captain Peter Townsend , the royal family did its best to see that there was little to talk about . Captain Townsend returned to Belgium after a three-day visit to England without so much as a glimpse of his princess : neither he nor Margaret attended last week 's classic St. Leger horse race at which it was hoped they might meet and exchange , at the very least , a significant look . The Court Calendar noted without comment the visit to Balmoral Castle of Britain 's Attorney General , which led the Associated Press into excited speculation that perhaps he and the Queen were talking over how to get Margaret married . English editors , who know more than they print , did not fall for such speculation : they know that the legal considerations are being handled , not by the Attorney General , but by the Lord Chancellor . <P> Margaret 's long-awaited 25th birthday ( after which she presumably can marry whom she pleases without the Queen 's permission ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tabloid headlines as COME ON , MARGARET and PLEASE MAKE UP YOUR MIND . All the proper British papers condemned such improper journalism . But the surprising fact in the whole situation was how carefully the respectable papers , without being so vulgar as to mention Townsend 's name , had kept their readers up on the news . They did so by a sudden rash of articles about the archaic Royal Marriage Act which requires that Parliament shall have a year in which to disapprove of any marriage in the royal family . The Manchester Guardian learnedly explained that the act was passed by the slimmest of majorities in 1772 to control the marriages contracted by the libertine brothers of George III . " Sensible mortals , " concluded the Guardian last week , " will doubtless feel that in the 20th century , such matters can safely be left to the head of the royal family without the restrictions of antique acts of Parliament . " " Is n't it time , " asked Lord Beaverbrook 's Daily Express , " we took this chain from Princess Margaret ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editors seemed to be saying that if Margaret chooses to renounce her right of succession in order to marry Townsend , her decision is all right with them .
