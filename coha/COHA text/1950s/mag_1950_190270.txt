Giovanni Antonio Bazzi ( 1477-1549 ) has been called both a great artist and a hack imitator . Pope Leo X made him a Cavalier of the Order of Christ ; Art Historian Vasari , also a contemporary , described him simply as " a beast . " He was also known as " The Sodomite , " which pleased him ; Bazzi signed his letters " Il Sodoma " - the name he is known by today . <P> Last week Siena , his home town , celebrated the 401st anniversary of Il Sodoma 's death with a full-dress retrospective exhibition drawn from France and Germany as well as Italy . Along with the 70-odd paintings and drawings on show was a batch of personal documents that proved him to have been the luxury product of a wide-open age ; lazy , cynical , proud , humorous and wild . <P> He wrote songs in praise of homosexuality and accompanied them on the lute with what Vasari grudgingly described as " no little facility . " He kept a string of race horses , and pets by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marmosets , turtle doves , and a raven which he taught to answer the door . In an inventory of goods filed with the Siena tax collector in 1512 , Il Sodoma also listed " a donkey that talks theology to the priests . " <P> When he was low in funds , II Sodoma gave in to the pleas of his admiring patrons and worked a bit . He had well assimilated the painting techniques of his consistently great contemporaries , Da Vinci and Raphael . He had once taken the trouble to copy Da Vinci 's painting of Leda , which has since been lost , and II Sodoma 's copy was long mistaken for the original . He could draw , when he cared to , with serene accuracy ; he knew how to round out shapes by blurring their contours ( sfumato ) , and how to steep his fingers in rippling depths of light and shadow ( chiaroscuro ) . <P> Such pictures as his Nuptials of Alexander in Rome 's Villa Farnesina and the Saint Sebastian which he painted on a processional banner ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were quick , badly botched candidates for the booby prize . Their quality , or lack of it , was apt to depend on the fee .
