<P> An unhappy exception in the generally flourishing economies of Western Europe is the coal glut ; mountains of coal rise high alongside the smoking industrial chimneys . More than 14 million surplus tons clog Germany 's Ruhr , and 20,000 miners have been laid off . Continued production at Belgium 's notoriously uneconomic Borinage shafts ( TIME , March 2 ) added to the stocks of 7,000,000 tons of coal already piled up in Belgium , so that , as one coal producer put it , " we literally have no more room anywhere to put the coal we produce which nobody will buy . " <P> The glut is giving the six-nation European Coal and Steel Community the severest test of its six-year history . Eliminating frontiers and the barriers that go with them , the Community had progressed smoothly on a rising market . But coal 's current slump provides a painful reminder that although barriers may technically be gone , barrier mentality is far from dead . The pressures of economic self-interest have begun to resist the supranational powers originally granted by treaty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , warning of a coming coal crisis , the High Authority urged member nations to cut back production . The Belgians largely ignored pleas to modernize their mines , close marginal producers . Germany 's Ludwig Erhard resisted any imposition of production quotas . He preferred to slap domestic tariffs on imports from outside the area ( including $4.76 a ton on U.S. coal ) and higher taxes on other fuels to boost coal sales . Italy and Luxembourg want to continue buying cheaper U.S. coal , even if this is considered disloyal to surplus-ridden Community producers . The French hinted that they might not obey orders to restrict production , which , though helping the Belgians , would be merely " exporting unemployment into France . " <P> Prodded by desperate Belgium , the High Authority last week proposed to the Community 's Council of Ministers that " a state of manifest crisis " be declared , permitting imposition of mandatory quotas . But in the Council of Ministers , composed of cabinet ministers of all six nations , supranationalism meets nationalism . Despite Belgium 's crisis , the ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressures .
