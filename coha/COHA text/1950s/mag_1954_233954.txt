History students persist in some strange ideas about the economic past . Thomas S. Ashton , professor of economic history at the London School of Economics , has come to this conclusion from reading student examinations . Last week , in an essay called The Treatment of Capitalism by Historians ? * Ashton told what some of these ideas are-and roundly denounced them as a tired old libel of the capitalist system . <P> First of all , Ashton says , " there is a shadow . . . cast by the grievances-real or alleged-of workingmen who lived and died a century ago . According to a large number of the scripts examinations which it has been my lot to read , the course of English history since about the year 1760 to the setting-up of the welfare state in 1945 was marked by little but toil and sweat and oppression . " <P> Wrong Cue . Economic historians have too often taken their cue from the reports of royal commissions , completely disregarding the fact that the commissions were dealing " with social grievances , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they painted of early Victorian society " has become fixed in the minds of popular writers and is reproduced in my scripts . " Yet , says Ashton , a careful study of these reports should have revealed another picture-that it was not in the factories , but " in the garret or cellar workshops that conditions were at their worst . " <P> Though such conditions date back to the 18th century , few historians , Ashton maintains , have bothered to make the comparison . " It was so much easier to pick out the more sensational evidences of distress and work them into a dramatic story of exploitation . . . Conditions in the mills and the factory town were so bad , it seemed , that there must have been deterioration ; and , since the supposed deterioration had taken place at a time when machinery had increased , the machines , and those who owned them , must have been responsible . " <P> The romantics among the historians not only overestimated the happy state of pre-industrial man , but also the misery of the industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought a substantial increase in wages , and if the workers were jammed together in rickety " jerry-built " houses , it was not the fault of the capitalists . " The typical builder was a man of small means , a bricklayer or a carpenter . . . The jerry-builders were not capitalists but workingmen "
