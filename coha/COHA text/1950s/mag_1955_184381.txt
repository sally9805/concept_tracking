Churchmen , like businessmen and bees , tend to swarm in the late spring . Last week the denominational convention season was well under way , and elections , budgets and resolutions filled the air . <P> In Miami , 11,584 " messengers , " as Southern Baptist voting delegates are called , met to represent 8,169,491 members of 29,899 churches in 30 states . They passed a record budget of $10 million for 1956 ( up $800,000 over 1955 ) and elected the Rev. Dr. Caspar C. Warren of the First Baptist Church in Charlotte , N.C. as convention president . Under the eyes of a delegation of nine Baptists from the U.S.S.R. , the convention passed a resolution to congratulate President Eisenhower for his " patient diplomatic conduct , " urged a " more determined effort " at armament reduction and elimination of atomic , weapons . <P> In Atlantic City , some 10,000 delegates assembled for the 48th annual American Baptist Convention , fourth largest of the 26 Baptist groups in the U.S. , with 6,000 churches and 1,600,000 members . They noted a building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least half of their present churches carrying on building expansion programs , and $6,500,000 of their $8,000,000 building fund already raised . Unanimously the A.B.C . accepted the proposal of Southern Baptist Convention President Warren to participate with his group , together with the National Baptist Convention , U.S.A. ( Negro ) and the National Baptist Convention of America ( Negro ) , in a five-year evangelistic crusade , starting in 1959 , to " win America for Christ . " <P> In Los Angeles , 905 voting " commissioners " of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. ( northern ) turned out for its 167th General Assembly , representing 2,658,903 members and 256 presbyteries . Without a dissenting voice , the delegates approved a statement of the church 's Permanent Commission deploring the Roman Catholic " trend to exalt the figure of the Virgin Mother to the office of associate partner in the work of redemption . " This development , said the statement , " has widened the breach between the Roman Catholic Church and all other Christian communions . . . " <P> In Boston . 583 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unitarian Association heard a report of a committee appointed last year to study the thorny question of whether Unitarians have any business making resolutions on non-church matters . " To abandon the practice now , " the report decided , " could be interpreted as a move of caution or expediency ... in the present climate of opinion adverse to free speech , heretical views and diversity of opinion . " One of the " hazards " of being a Unitarian , according to the report , is that Unitarians believe in " work for the kingdom of God . " and that kingdom includes " public affairs .
