For a select group of Americans there is a global plan of expense-paid travel . In Paris , for example , such a privileged person may be met on arrival by an officer of the U.S. Embassy-sometimes fondly called " the Boodle Man . " The traveler is handed an envelope containing the boodle : as much as $500 in French francs . From then on , the visitor is on his own , needs only to check in with the embassy 's boodle man to replenish his wallet . In 1955 in Paris alone , some 700 Junketeers availed themselves of this service , to the tune of $100,000 ; in 1956 , the number dropped to 400 , the amount to $46,000 . <P> To be eligible for membership in this exclusive club , Americans must be members of the U.S. Congress , or staff employees of the various congressional committees . The money they spend comes from counterpart funds , i.e. , local currencies accruing to the U.S. Government in exchange for U.S. dollars spent under foreign-aid programs . And best of all , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports need not be fully detailed or made public . <P> Nail-Chewing Functionaries . For the most part , the funds are spent with a sense of responsibility by Congressmen and their staffs educating themselves . But there are some who ride the Uncle-pays plan like a gravy train . Last week , in offices scattered all over the world . U.S. diplomatic and information officials were recounting a nightmarish story of two such hellbent freeloaders , both staff members of the Senate Appropriations Committee . They are Grace Johnson , fiftyish , tough-talking , weight-throwing $10,000-a-year staffer and longtime friend of Louisiana 's Democratic Senator Allen J. Ellender ; and her companion , Mississippi-born Mary Frances Holloway , fortyish , an assistant committee clerk . Twice , the two women made prolonged trips abroad , ostensibly to investigate the operations of the U.S. Information Service , each time leaving a wake of empty bottles , empty pockets and nail-chewing functionaries . <P> The nightmare was the same nearly everywhere : the investigators showed up in Paris last fall in the company of former Senate Page Boy Joseph Stewart , 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 days in Paris , appeared only rarely at the embassy . A typical business request : a list of USIS employees , salaries , etc. - the kind of information that is always available in Washington . For the rest of their stay , the investigators searchingly investigated shops , restaurants , bars , entertained themselves to exhaustion . <P> " You 're Out . " In another European capital , the investigators grumbled about their meager counterpart allowance ( $100 daily apiece ) , complained about their hotel rooms ( de luxe ) , threatened to " make it tough " for any official who failed to come across with any of a variety of services they demanded . " If you do n't give us the treatment we expect , " announced one of them to a high U.S. official , " you 're out . We 'll take care of you when we get back to Washington . " At one point , Investigator Johnson cabled then-SHAPE Commander General Alfred Gruenther , demanded an airplane to fetch them for delivery at their next stop . The general declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conned the Air Force out of a plane for their own use .
