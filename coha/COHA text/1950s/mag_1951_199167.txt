" We are trying , " said Publisher William Randolph Hearst Jr. , " to do away with the oldish elements that have crept into our operations . " And so the Hearst empire was getting the biggest shaking up in years . As the " oldish elements " were swept out , so were many of the oldish ideas of the late W. R. Hearst . <P> Over the wires to the editors of his 18 daily and Sunday papers , Bill Hearst sent orders for more local stories and editorials , more straight news reporting ( " Avoid bias or lack of objectivity " ) . Some papers started using a more conservative makeup . Even the familiar " must-go " editorials , once the staple of every Hearst editorial page , have been reduced . <P> " What 's Our Policy ? " Hearst editors have already dropped some of the most cherished campaigns of the Chief and his great &; good friend Marion Davies. * Less than a week after Hearst died , the Los Angeles Examiner printed its last blast against vivisection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a Milwaukee Sentinel staffer asked , " What 's our policy now on McCarthy ? " Managing Editor J. J. Packman replied : " We have no policy on McCarthy . Play the story for what it 's worth . " <P> Along with urging his papers to push more local issues , Bill Hearst has also been busy reshuffling his high command . He moved Washington Bureau Chief Edward C. Lapping in as executive editor of the ailing Chicago Herald-American . When Publisher Hearst dropped the empire 's Saturday Home Magazine , Lapping put out his own Sunday supplement . Into the top spot on Pittsburgh 's Sun-Telegraph went Albert E. Dale , a veteran Hearst editor who left twelve years ago , worked for NBC , also did public relations . Lee Ettleson , former executive editor of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer , moved over to run the San Francisco Call-Bulletin , and more changes are in the offing for Detroit and other cities . But the biggest shake-up of all came to the American Weekly , once the brightest jewel in the Hearst diadem . <P> Candybox-Cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulation ( still a giant 9,966,689 ) had dipped under that of its chief competitor , This Week . To pull it out of the slump , Publisher Hearst called in a magazine specialist , Ernest V. Heyn , 47 , who founded and edited Modern Screen for Dell publications , started Sport for Macfadden . Some drastic changes showed up in last week 's issue of the Weekly . Heyn got rid of the Weekly 's old-fashioned clothes by dumping the wispy , candybox-cover girls . A new editorial diet replaced the oldtime brew of bloodshed , bosoms and pseudo-science that had built the Weekly up in its heyday , but let it down in its old age . ( The first Weekly editor , Morrill Goddard , regularly held up as a model to his writers the famed Weekly headline : NAILED HER FATHER 'S HEAD TO THE FRONT DOOR . ) The Weekly began to run more how-to-do-it features on fashions , homemaking , health and beauty . <P> So far , such Hearst magazines as Harper 's Bazaar , House Beautiful and Good Housekeeping have not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . A new editor and other new staffers have already moved in on Hearst 's American Druggist and it will soon come out fortnightly instead of monthly . <P>
