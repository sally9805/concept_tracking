Taking a short cut through the hedge , Mrs. Carter ran next door , a letter fluttering in her hand . " I 'm so upset , " she began as soon as the door was opened to her . " A letter just came from Mary Lou . She says she 's pinned , and we 've never even met the boy , and she 's only known him a few weeks . What do you think we ought to do ? " Mrs. Carter was close to tears . " Nothing , I guess , " her neighbor said thoughtfully . " You 'll have to wait and see if the pinning sticks . It may mean nothing . " " But I thought it was an engagement . Both your girls ? " " Pinning is engaged to be engaged . ' A sort of trial run . It did take with our girls , but it does n't always . I was as upset as you are when I first heard about it . It seemed so , well , unconventional . But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has created a new social status . For hundreds of years a woman could only be single , engaged , married , widowed , or divorced . Today a girl need be none of these ; instead , she may be pinned . You wo n't find the rules of pinning in the etiquette books ; many parents have never heard of it ; society does n't recognize it ; but those most concerned honor it and understand it . Even the parlance is new and may sound strange to adult ears . A young man says , " I 'm pinned to Marjorie . " Or his friends may put it that " Joe has pinned a girl from Detroit . " The girl too is pinned " to " someone . Less often you hear that " she 's accepted his pin . " A few rituals are growing up around pinning . On some coed campuses the girl who has just been pinned is serenaded or otherwise singled out by the fraternity she has " joined " ; at one Midwestern college , fraternity houses give a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinned to members have the honor of serving dinner to their hosts . But there are not many such recognitions . Usually pinning is an informal , personal affair . That 's one reason it 's a comfortable thing to try on to see if it fits . No society page carries word that the parents " have the honor to announce " ; there are no formal parties , no presents . The boy feels no obligation to call on the girl 's father and verbally flip open his bankbook and discuss his prospects . If the pinning does n't last . there need be no public notice , no returning of gifts , no embarrassing explanations , perhaps less heartbreak . It 's a private affair in which the pledges made and taken are whatever the two concerned want them to be . In Mary Lou Carter 's case it amounted to nothing ; for when she  | came home for Thanksgiving , she was no longer pinned . " Tom was too much in earnest and kept talking about when we could get married . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin . " In most cases pinning means far more than that . Young people everywhere say emphatic-.11y that they consider being pinned serious ? more serious , perhaps , than some of their parents consider an engagement . Certainly today 's pinning has no likeness to the way fraternity pins were collected fifteen or twenty years ago ! By the very fact that pinning does usually carry real significance , it creates a relationship that could mean much to the future happiness of the boy and girl who are pinned . Under its influence they can relax some of the superficialities of casual dating and get to know each other better . Because they have ( at least for the time being ) picked a common goal , they can be more frank about finances , friends , interests , hopes . Or they may use pinning quite openly as a device to get their families used to the idea of a coming engagement , knowing they wo n't object to this status as strenuously as they would to a formal engagement announcement while the boy or girl is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinning is the fact that it 's a private affair ? accepted , yes , but far from clear-cut in its meaning . It can mean what it did to Mary Lou , who was thrilled when her first college beau offered her his pin , though it meant no promise on her part . Or it can mean what it does to the impecunious medical student whose pin has to carry the same deep significance as a ring , because it 's all he has to give his love by way of a pledge , along with his heart . GRANTED pinning is a current social phenomenon , the question is why ? Surely it must have taken a powerful force to change the customs of generations and to put this earlier stage in front of the time-honored sequence of engagement and marriage . Pinning appears to be a definite seeking for security . The boys and girls who are now at the courting age have never felt steady ground under their feet . Always life has been insecure , war has loomed , the old moralities have been shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but surely the quest for security in the most important of human relations also accounts for the younger and younger marriages that are a matter of recent record . In 1940 , 27 per cent of the men and 51 per cent of the girls who were between the ages of 20 and 24 were married . By 1950 , 43 per cent of the men and 66 per cent of the girls between those same ages were married . Today 31 per cent of girls are married by the time they are nineteen . Pinning is a kind of " social security " in the years before marriage . Less binding and more private than an engagement , it is an attempt to find someone to depend on . Sometimes it seems that young people must make the most important decision of their lives in the midst of tremendous pressures . Perhaps our boys and girls have invented a more reliable way of choosing a mate .  |
