AMERICANS ' regard for their pioneers , which comes to bloom around the Fourth of July , feeds largely on word and spirit . But to reinforce facts in print and feelings in the heart , there is testimony by eyewitnesses-the painters who were there . Some of their best evidence is presented on the following pages . <P> Because they made no distinction between art and craft , the early pioneer American painters did not lack craftsmanship ; each of their canvases was at least as well painted as the wall on which it hung . But by European standards , early colonial art was medieval . Being mostly commoners cut off from London court life , the Puritans had remained unaware of Renaissance art . Instead of trying to paint people in the round , they produced flat , stylized maps of their sitters . The word for this , derived from medieval illuminating of manuscripts , was " limning . " It permitted likenesses of a limited sort , but lifelikeness was beyond it . <P> Margaret Gibbs is a classic example of the Puritan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye not like a real girl in a real world but like a dream of one . Her body looks no thicker than a dress on a clothes hanger . The ringleted hair , silver necklace , lace , drawstrings and bows are presented distinctly . But it would be hard to guess how Margaret looked from the side . Her square-toed shoes scarcely touch the floor , and though the floor is seen from above , Margaret stands at eye level . Nevertheless , the portrait is superb as well as typical limning . Margaret neither looms out of the picture nor shrinks into it , but stands quiet and assured , with soft gestures and thinking eyes . <P> Captain Thomas Smith is an amazing canvas , for its time and place . Done within a few years of the Gibbs picture , it made the leap from medieval toward renaissance portraiture . The captain , who painted it himself , thought in terms of shapes not pattern , action not stillness , and character not spirit . Almost nothing is known about Smith , but his picture presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes plain that he had sailed the sea , that he had seen European pictures , and that he was a stern man , thoughtful of death . The poem under the pictured skull reads , in part : <P> Why why should I the World be minding <P> therein a World of Evils Finding Then Farwell World : Farwell thy Janes <P> thy Joies thy Toies thy Wiles thy Warrs <P> Ann Pollard stands outside art history . The anonymous artist plainly forgot himself and what little he may have known of artistic conventions the moment Dame Pollard 's basilisk stare fell upon him . He painted her neither as a tender dream , like Margaret Gibbs , nor as a fleshly reality , like Thomas Smith , but as an apparition . Shrewd as J. P. Morgan , straight as Queen Victoria , she rises out of the night , holding her book like a scepter . The ancient well merited her haunting memorial . One of Boston 's original settlers , she bore twelve children , kept a tavern and lived to be 105 , surviving all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
