Spring had come gently to Britain . Chestnuts were pushing out baby buds , and clotted cream was off the ration and was being spread thickly on Devonshire scones . Talk of peace ( if not peace itself ) was in the air . A queen would soon be crowned ; the sound of hammering could be heard all over Mayfair as viewing stands went up. * Rab Butler 's budget matched what seemed to be a common British resolve : to make the coronation year a gala occasion . <P> Britons did not fool themselves about their new budget . When it came down to plain shillings and pence , the tax cuts were small ; no Briton was going to need larger pockets . But the tax cuts were a well-timed tonic for the British spirit . A London lady read about them , calculated that they would save her 70 this year , and promptly asked a painter to paint the front of her house for the 70 . <P> Risks and Gain . Whether Rab Butler 's budget results in a durable coronation-year glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is deliberately taking . He wants tax savings plowed back into business , not distributed as profits . <P> But Britain 's business and labor alike have grown unused to the risks - and gains-of an adventuresome economy . Through years of encroaching government , they have become accustomed to subsidized industry , protected markets , guaranteed full employment . Recently , Rab Butler 's new National Productivity Council tried to persuade union representatives that more and cheaper production is Britain 's only hope . The council got nowhere , for union men have long memories of un employment and living on " bread and drip . " Said one delegate : " If you ask a Tyneside worker to turn a ship around in two weeks instead of four , he wants to know what you would expect him to do with the other fortnight . ' ' <P> It is the same with many businessmen . The 39-year-old boss of a family-owned box factory in Cheshire knows that he could double his business . " That would n't thrill me , " he says . " I consider myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too big . . . We have always been able to sell all we wanted . Where you get people who have been working together for a long time , you just ca n't break them of their habits . There is a tempo that goes with the business and gets ingrained into it . . . " <P> <P> In a Rut . Yet there were signs that some winds were blowing Rab Butler 's way . " We are getting out of our immediate difficulties , " said Stephen Burman , a Midlands industrialist , last week , " and we can retrieve our place as a leading world power if we get down to it . But we have had life too easy ; there has been a safety-first attitude . . . Every year I send a manager either to the Continent or to the U.S. to look for the best machinery for the job we do ... but many others are in a rut and wo n't follow the lead . <P> <P> " A new outlook is needed here ... I think our younger executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , if we do wake up , all of us , then heaven help the rest of the world . " If there was enough of that spirit around the old islands , Rab Butler could plan on even better news to relate in the second year of the Elizabethan Age , come Budget Day , 1954.
