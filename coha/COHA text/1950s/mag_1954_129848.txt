Often a writer can do in fiction what he can not do with facts , just as a painter can catch essences and meanings and emotions that may elude the finest camera . This short story ? the first to be published in SI ? might be called a " baseball story , " but it is really about the community of people . Brooklyn is Brooklyn , and yet it might be any baseball town after the home team has blown a lead in the ninth . // It 's one of those long , drawn-out games at Ebbets Field , and it 's not over till nearly six o'clock . We come out hot and tired , and with a little headache ? you know how it is after a game ? and the kid says he wants a hot dog . // " I like the long ones , Pop , " he says . // You know the kind they sell outside the park at those little hot-dog stands , long and skinny and rubbery . // " Never mind , " I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the big crowd is pouring out of the exit gates . It 's almost six o'clock and Madge has the supper on the table , and I can see her fuming , and the kid 's talking about hot dogs . // " Forget it , " I tell him . // Who thinks about food when the Dodgers lose ? You sit there for nearly three and a half hours and you try to root them home . You 're with them every minute , every play , and you have it in the bag , and then it 's gone over the wall . // " That was some home run , " the kid says . // " Shut up , " I tell him . " Keep quiet . " // " Well , it was good , Pop . Way out toward center field . " // A home run in the last inning which wins the ball game and sends the Brooklyns down to defeat is never a good home run . What the kid means is that it was well hit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I admit that . The ball travels maybe four hundred feet before it clears the fence in right center , so it 's a good hit . All right , but do n't rub it in . Three and a half hours I sit there in the bleachers on a hot day and we lose anyway . So what 's good about it ? // A guy on the trolley says to me , " They shoulda passed him , that Kluszewski. " // " Alston did n't wan na put the winning run on base , " I tell him . " That 's baseball . You play the averages . " // " He did n't put Kluszewski on , neither , " this guy says , grinning . " Klu hit it an ' kept goin ' . " // This guy jokes , yet . This is a time for jokes when you have a ball game sewed up eight-to-seven in the ninth , and you lose it with a home-run ball . // I look out the window , and the guy says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even look at him . That kind of guy I do n't look at . // You do n't mind losing a ball game now and then , but when you lose to Cincinnati it hurts , especially when you got it sewed up , and especially in September and you 're way out of first place and that old lost column can murder you . // The kid 's getting wise here . He 's eleven now , and I 've had him down to a lot of ball games , and he argues baseball with the other kids on the block . // He says now , " They shoulda took Oiskin out . " // " Never mind , " I tell him . " Forget about it . " // Why ca n't they let it drop ? It 's over and we lose it , so it goes down in the records , and you never change the records , not even if the Russians come over and take this country . It 's down in the books . // So maybe Alston should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Podres walks three-four guys and it 's over anyway , and Alston 's a dope again . He should have left Erskine in. // I do n't like to second-guess the manager . The guy is out there with his job to do , and he knows more about it than anybody else . Just like me in the shop . In the shop I know my job and I do it . I do n't like a guy coming around and telling me it might work out better some other way . // I 'm just saying , though , that if it was me in Alston 's shoes I 'd have had Shuba pinch-hit for Erskine the end of the eighth , and maybe bring us in another run or two , so when this big clown belts one over the wall in the ninth we still got the lead . With Erskine out for a pinch hitter I 'd have stuck Roe in there for one inning with that slow stuff . It might have been a different ball game . // Like I say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly to work yourself up into a stew because we dropped one . Just forget about it ; let it drop . // I hear a guy in the seat behind me say , " They shoulda pulled a squeeze in the seventh with Reese on third . When Dressen was runnin ' this club we worked a lot of squeeze plays . We 'd of had that extra run , and when Kluszewski hits that homer it 's only tied up , an ' ? " // You see how they try to dope it out ? It 's dead ; it 's in the record books . So who 's up when Reese is on third and one away ? Gil Hodges is up , and Gil is a long-ball hitter . Since when do you ask your long-ball hitter to bunt ? That guy behind me is crazy . Any kind of fly ball would have brought Reese in . So Hodges struck out ; so Alston knew he was gon na strike out ? // If it was me I 'd have had Reese try to steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taking a long windup . I 'm not telling Alston how to run his ball club , but you can see how it goes around and around inside your head . I 've heard of guys going off their trolley arguing points like this . // Madge says when we come into the house at about six-thirty : // " What were you doing ? standing outside the field asking for their autographs ? " // She has that look on her face . The pots are still on the stove , all covered up , and they 've been there for some time , I can see . // " It was a long game , " I tell her . // " It 's always a long game down there , " she says , and the way she says " there " you 'd think she was talking of some gin mill somewhere . // She should be married to a heavy drinker or a guy who plays the horses like some of them in the shop . I do n't have any bad habits ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Ebbets Field . That 's wrong ? // " Sit down and eat your supper , " Madge says . // " Pop would n't buy me a hot dog , " the kid tells her . // " I 'm not surprised , " Madge says . " He probably did n't even know you were with him . " // " I bought him two in the park , " I snap . " He wants another one on the way home . What am I ? Rockefeller ? " // " He 'd have had a better time at Brighton Beach , " Madge says as she 's banging the pots around on the stove . // " My vacation , " I tell her . " Monday we go to the beach . Wednesday we go to the beach . What am I ? a seal ? " // " Sit down , " she says . // I notice that there are four plates set out and I know who the other plate is for . He comes in from the parlor , snapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see tonight . // Uncle Nathan is my brother-in-law , a bachelor , and he lives in a rooming house around the corner from us . Every once in a while ? and even once is too often ? Madge invites him around for supper . I 'm practically supporting this guy , and I think that , secretly , he likes the Giants . // " Lost again , " Uncle Nathan grins as he sits down opposite me . " Heard it on the radio . " // " Again , " I tell him acidly . " Do n't I know it 's again ? " // " The Reds , " Uncle Nathan says . " The Cincinnati Reds from Cincinnati . " // He 's a guy who never goes to a ball game , but he can make remarks like that . He do n't know first base from second . // " Kluszewski hit a home run and won the game in the ninth inning , " the kid says , and I have to hear that over again . // " They should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Uncle Nathan says . // " What 's wrong with Hodges ? " I ask him . " What 's wrong with a guy who hits over three hundred and drives in all them runs ? " // " Eat your supper , " Madge says . // Who feels like eating , especially with Uncle Nathan sitting across from you , smirking ? Uncle Nathan is a small , pot-bellied guy with a circle of fuzzy hair around his bald head . All his life he 's lived in Brooklyn , twenty minutes from the field , and never saw a game . That 's a citizen ! // " Who was it beat them this afternoon ? " Uncle Nathan says . " I never heard of the guy . " // " How many guys you ever heard of in baseball ? " I ask him . // " Eat your supper , Joe , " Madge says . " You 'd all be a lot better off if you spent your time on something more educational . " // I could make some remarks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got arguments up to the neck , already . Education . What 's education but knowing something , and what 's better to know than Brooklyn wins ? // " Hear the Giants won this afternoon , " Uncle Nathan says , without looking up from his plate . " Three-to-one over the Cardinals . They got it made . " // " They 'll fade in the stretch , " I say . " They 'll drop a few , and we 'll catch them in the last week . We got a three-game series here , remember . " // Imagine a guy talking about the Giants down here in Flatbush . A guy like that is crazy . He should be arrested . // I do n't eat much tonight because I 'm not hungry , and I guess I do n't say much , either , because Madge says , as she 's bringing out the dessert : // " All afternoon you yell your head off at the game . When you come home , you shut up like a clam. " // " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ta talk every minute ? " // " He 'd be talkin ' plenty , " Uncle Nathan says , " if the Dodgers had won . " // I do n't even bother to answer . // The kid , sitting next to me at the table , says , " That Kluszewski sure can hit . " // We have pork chops for supper , but they do n't taste good ; the peas do n't taste good either . Imagine a guy with a name you ca n't even pronounce licking the Dodgers ? Down at the field I hear this Kluszewski 's name pronounced about nine different ways . Any way you say it , though , it goes down in the books as a Brooklyn loss . // My wife says , " I spend the afternoon making a supper and he eats it like he was a bird . " // " So I have to stuff myself every meal ? " I say . " That 's smart ? " // I 'm glad when I can get outside . I go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We live in a nice section in Flatbush here ? two-family houses , with a little plat of ground out front . It 's not much as far as ground goes , maybe six feet from the house to the sidewalk . Most everybody has a little shrubbery . // I get out the hose and I water the shrubbery because we have n't had any rain in a week . Next to me lives Saul Ruskin , who is my neighbor . Saul is sitting in one of those aluminum-and-plastic chairs that folds up , and you wonder how it holds his weight . // The plat out in front of Saul 's house he 's filled in with cement , so he has sidewalk from the house all the way to the curb , and no shrubbery , no grass or weeds to worry about . // " I should be a farmer ? " Saul says . " I wan na raise crops , I move out to the suburbs . " // Saul watches me as I hook up the hose . He has a stub of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar , " A tough one to lose , Joe . Them Reds allus get hot against us. " // " They have to win once in a while , " I tell him . // Saul is a dyed-in-the-wool Brooklyn rooter . I see he do n't feel too good about this one , either , and it makes me feel a little better . // " These clubs come in here loaded , " Saul says . " They save their best pitchers for Brooklyn . They do all their hittin ' at Ebbets Field . It ai n't right . " // " That 's baseball , " I tell him as I start to squirt the shrubbery . // " Couple of Sundays back I see Pittsburgh , " Saul says . " They score eighteen runs in two games . They do n't score eighteen runs in a whole season . That 's the way it goes . " // " I know , " I tell him sympathetically . // " That home run Klusoositz hits , " Saul says . " It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Saul , " I tell him . " He hits that long ball . " // " Allus against us , " Saul scowls . He pauses and then he adds , " Alston maybe shoulda passed him , a guy hits like that . " // " Man on second an ' one out , " I tell him . " Kluszewski ai n't made a hit all day . " // " Then he was due , " Saul says . " You ca n't shut out a guy like that four-five times in one game . He was due . " // " They took a chance . Erskine got him before . " // The guy lives upstairs from me is just coming back from Sam Klein 's candy store , where he has bought some cigarets , and he stops to talk . He says : " A good game , Joe ? " // " Brooklyns lose , Lennie , " Saul says . " That 's a good game ? " // " You know what I mean , " Lennie says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
