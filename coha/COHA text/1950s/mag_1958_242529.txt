Does the Academic Procession sometimes resemble an Oklahoma land rush for prestige and pay , with an unseemly flapping of gowns and gums as scholars jostle for position ? In a book that seems likely to make the organization scholar a notorious subspecies of the herd-running Organization Man , Sociologists Theodore Cap-low and Reece J. McGee examine the rush as it is run at ten unnamed major universities . The authors of The Academic Marketplace ( Basic Books ; $4.95 ) find schools and scholars ridden with intrigue and lustful for prestige , often indifferent to teaching and scholarship . <P> Documentation of their charges suggests some clear-and clearly controversial-answers to a question put by Columbia Dean Jacques Barzun in the foreword : " Why has the American college and university so little connection with Intellect ? " In language that is often witty and only occasionally typical of sociology 's bread-pudding prose , Professors Caplow ( University of Minnesota ) and McGee ( University of Texas ) list academe 's hurtful mores and petty machinations . Some of the worst : <P> Promotion . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faculties of major universities in the United States today , the evaluation of performance is based almost exclusively on publication . " Result : a neglect of what teachers are hired for-teaching-and " a great deal of foolish and unnecessary research . . . undertaken by men who bring to their investigations neither talent nor interest . " The ambitious academician 's sole aim is to accumulate published titles , as a young actor squirrels away television credits . Title-squirreling pays off : " Success is likely to come to the man who has learned to neglect his assigned duties " in favor of his " private professional interests . " <P> Hiring . Ability to teach is , for the most part , not important . Sample quotes from hiring committees : 1 ) " The biggest thing is that other people think well of him . " 2 ) " They 're supposed to be able to teach , I guess . " 3 ) " Our requirements are purely mathematical ; no one gives a damn if you can teach . " Scholarship appears to count for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but seldom , committee members admitted , are the articles read . More than one university confessed that a socially presentable wife is one of the scholarly attributes it looks for . <P> Conformity . Not surprisingly , the authors list agreement with one 's department head as a must for advancement . But conformity reaches beyond scholarly dogmas . One teacher complained that his department head " believed that conviviality and sociability were the prime qualities for a professor . We had parties twice a month , played golf , etc. all the time . We also had a lousy department . " '
