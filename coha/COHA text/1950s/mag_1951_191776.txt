Like a wet snowball in the back came an announcement from customs : 20 ( $56 ) duty might be charged on 55 crates of snow sent from Norway for a ski-jumping contest on London 's Hampstead Heath . <P> Cried London 's Daily Mail : " What sterile , counting-machine mind decided that these chunks of climate must pay duty ? " Said the Times : " If the taxation is for revenue , the interest of the Exchequer demands the utmost effort to stimulate trade with the Polar region . . . " An Evening News cartoon pictured ogre-like customs men waiting to pounce on returning travelers . The caption read : " Ready , men ? Watch out for French air in the bicycle tires , Swiss mud on the ski boots , Italian sunburn , Continental elan . " <P> Last week 20,000 Londoners watched the ski-jump ; the Norwegian snow came in duty-free after the sponsors had filled out a customs form setting forth that the snow would be used for sport , and not commercially .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
