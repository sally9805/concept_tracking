In the newspaper empire that John Shively Knight built , the boss 's brother , Jim Knight , has played a secondary role . It was the elder ( by 15 years ) brother Jack who took full charge of the Akron Beacon Journal in 1933 on the death of their father , and led the expansion into four other cities . It was Jack Knight , too , who sold the prosperous Chicago Daily News three months ago to Marshall Field Jr . ( TIME , Jan. 19 ) . " All I wanted to do , " Jack said then to those who speculated on the imminent dismemberment of the chain , " was relax a little , and give a little bit more to Jim . " Last week James Landon Knight , 49 , got quite a bit more : for $1,500,000 he bought the Charlotte , N.C. News ( circ. 65,508 ) , thereby restoring the Knight group to five papers* and moving to the front page for the first time as the potential successor to the throne . <P> Victory in Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unaccustomed prominence . He has climbed the hard way , by merit , in a family empire where climbing was scarcely necessary . By disposition , he settled on the business side . " Jack is n't any bookkeeper , " he said , " and I 've always been sort of a tinker . " When Jack Knight bought the Miami Herald in 1937 , Tinker Jim went down and hammered it into shape . A relentless foe of back-room featherbedding , Jim took on a strike by the powerful International Typographical Union in 1948 , kept the paper on the street , set up a nonunion shop , won the battle hands down . ( The I.T.U. considers the strike still in effect to this day . ) All told , Jim performed so well that Jack put him in overall charge as Miami general manager in 1951 . Four years later , Jim Knight took over as publisher of a new Knight property : the fat and venerable Charlotte morning Observer . <P> In his quiet way , Jim shook the stodgy Observer alive . He dumfounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strict ban on " puff " copy tied to ad accounts-long a news staple of both Charlotte papers-revived the Observer 's bureau in Raleigh , the state capital , and added staffers in three Carolina cities . The Observer 's gloomy makeup vanished in a wash of white space , new type , and pictures boldly played ; its brighter columns carried livelier , shorter stories . Inevitably the Observer , historically dominant , stole further circulation and advertising marches on the News . By last year News Publisher Thomas Lambard Robinson , watching his paper slip below the break-even point , put it on the block , as a last resort offered it to Jim Knight . <P> Competition in Charlotte . The Knights , wary of complaints about monopoly , were not anxious to gobble up the News and take sole ownership in a town they entered only four years ago . But buying the News made the kind of economic sense that Jim Knight likes to make : fusing the mechanical and business office operations of the two papers will give the ledgers a real lift . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let each paper keep its individual character , with the News continuing as a folksy , locally oriented , feature-conscious paper , while the Observer moves on a somewhat more serious regional orbit . Jim Knight says he expects the papers to compete on the news side and disagree on the editorial pages .
