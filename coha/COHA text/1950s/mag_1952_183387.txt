Horsetrader David Harum never had such troubles . All Uncle Sam wanted to do last week was to be the honest broker between immovable Great Britain on one side and immovable Iran and Egypt on the other . It was late in the day , but nobody could say the U.S. did n't try-at least in its usual tentative way . <P> In Teheran , the U.S.-dominated World Bank offered to put up the money to reopen Iran 's oilfields and refineries . Iran simply had to agree to a three-way profit splits-with equal shares for the bank , Iran , and for the oil purchasers ( principally the dispossessed Anglo-Iranian Oil Co . ) . But Premier Mohammed Mossadegh wants no deals involving Anglo-Iranian ; he gave the bank little welcome . <P> Uncle Sam tried another scheme to save Mossadegh from himself . Washington offered Iran $24 million in U.S. Point Four aid , plus another ( estimated ) $50 million for guns , planes and tanks . In return , Mossadegh had to agree , by the terms of the Mutual Security Act , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free world . " Again Mossy balked ; after some frenzied haggling the U.S. emerged with a limp victory . It won a letter from Mossadegh reaffirming Iran 's adherence to the U.N . charter ; on that basis he would get the $24 million . Negotiations over the military aid continued . <P> Uncle Sam did even worse over Egypt . The State Department clumsily proposed to Great Britain that she surrender the Sudan to Egypt in return for Egypt 's joining the West 's Middle East Defense Command ( TIME , Oct. 22 ) . Britain bristled : such an idea , replied Whitehall , had " absolutely no likelihood " of being accepted " whatever the pressure . " Uncle Sam , all thumbs , gave up , said weakly : " It was only one of many ideas for the solution of this problem . . . " <P> And still there was no peace in Egypt . The extremist weekly , Al Gomhour , offered 1,000 Egyptian ( $2,880 ) to anyone who would kill Lieut . General Sir George Erskine , British canal zone commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed any British officer . In reply , Sir Brian Robertson , British Middle East commander , back from talks with Churchill , declared : " We shall go on month after month , for many months if need be . We shall meet force with force . . . We shall not be turned back from our policy by the passage of time or murderous episodes . "
