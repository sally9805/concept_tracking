 | " Use your ears , " he bawled in return . The kitchen boys came out to set a tub upon a stool , and put a smaller stool before it with a pillow . Wat meant to fling into the stables and sulk there , but somehow , he had to stay . With hatred and resentment , yet he had to stay . Paul came over then . " You 're not prettier for the expression on your face , " he said . " You 'll be no prettier if I put this fist in yours ! " Anger flashed in Paul 's expression , for they had never liked each other , but a quarrel could not be started here . Paul moved away , and left Wat to stand alone . Now the Welshman appeared , with my lady , and three maids all giggling , and it seemed a signal for a hubbub to begin . Heads were peering out of windows across the street , where the upper stories oversaw their wall ; their own household crowded out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any kind . The mastiff Murdach roared from his wall at strangers on his property and his iron ring clashed incessantly . The Welshman knelt on the smaller stool with the pillow , bells jingling , while a maid stood behind to hold his sleeves from the wet . My lady dunked his head herself and soaped it . " The best castile , " she proclaimed , above the splash and laughter . " Fresh-purchased from the apothecary . " The Welshman spat out soapsuds . " Still , " he replied , " not the best for eating . " A sally of laughter from all and a deeper dunking from my lady repaid him for being saucy . He came up choking and proclaiming he had never learned to swim . Onlookers yelled comment , and were answered smartly by Mary , who held a bowl of fresh water on her hip , spilling it down her skirts as she laughed and jumped . Anger boiled in Wat . What did that one have but a handsome face and garments so tight he 'd split his hose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point that laced his hose to his paltock ! Yet , unconsciously , Wat 's hands pulled at his own leather hose . He wore separate stockings in the old-fashioned way , while the Welshman followed new fashion and wore them like hose and drawers together in one garment , lacing at the waist to the bottom of his undershirt hem . His upper  | garment , the long-sleeved cote-hardie , was only long enough to hide that joining . The Welshman began to straighten , his face running soapy water , and Mary suddenly drenched him with clear , startling him straight up completely . Constance flung a great cloth over his head and shouted the tub must be dumped in the Thames . The Welshman was guided to sit on the stool , for he was blinded by the towel . He squatted very cautiously , while Wat hoped to hear a point snap , but he got safely down . The Welshman 's hand was out like a blind man 's , offering a silver comb to the air . My lady snatched it from him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . A silver comb with fine teeth on one side and coarse on the other , with the center polished and set with stones . " See the work on it , " Constance exclaimed . " This is a very fair comb and never another like it in the world . " She paused , significantly . " I would cherish such a comb . " " I will try to get one for you , " answered the Welshman , muffled in the towel , " but as for this , my lady , it was given me for a remembrance . " And my lady did not like that at all . " Oh , do not trouble , " she said , with a toss of her head . " I can send a servant and buy its like . " Whereupon she snatched the towel off his face , and with much pulling , combed his hair . That called Wat 's attention to how the stranger carried his dagger , at the back of his neck between his shoulders , from a silver collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! In this household , mink was hardly good enough . And when would my lady finish with him ? There was not much to comb . The Welshman wore his hair in the common style , as if a bowl had been placed on his head , and all below the tops of his ears shaved off . A good thick pad under a helm , they said of this style . But no armor had come with him . Only his lance with its green ribbon , a shield , and saddlebags he carried himself , nor trusted to a knave . Himself . There was a thought . If he sought to guard them , what was within ? Could he carry something valuable ? Wat 's fingers itched . It might be worth the stealing . My lady backed away , as if to admire her work , but she held on to the comb . She was determined to have the bauble . Wat grinned  | at the acquisitiveness of the sex . To get something of a man and keep it was a little triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man desired victories by the sword , so they collected trifles . And the Welshman knew this also , for he had turned swiftly around on his stool , and as my lady hiked up her overskirt to idly thrust the comb in a pocket beneath , whence no man would see it come again , the Welshman reached out . " It 's a keepsake , " he said , smiling , " and very dear to me . I 'll match it for you , my lady , but I 'll not part with this . " My lady saw with stupefaction that he would take it from her if he must . Perforce , she returned the bauble , but a storm was brewing in her look . " Take the old man for husband , " her father advised her joyously from the sidelines , " he 'll give you all you want ! " She ignored the provocation , though her brown eyes snapped . " Who was the lady ? " she asked , head atilt . " A Frenchwoman , " the stranger said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchwomen ! Dark of hair ? " " Light , " he answered . He would not say graying . That vexed her . " Blond women are wraiths , " she stated bluntly . " They all look drowned to me . Could you kiss a drowned woman ? " " I have never seen one , " he answered . " Have you ? " " Many , " she declared , with a flourish of the hand she 'd kept from childhood when she told lies and swore that they were true . " They float by , there , on the river . They drown themselves for love , the fools ! " Her father guffawed . " Thou liar ! " he declared . " Wat ! " she shrieked . " Loose the dog ! " The neighbor women squealed and fled , and slammed the street gate hard . The kitchen boys dove for their kitchen . Wat watched , with hands on hips , pleased to see the scattering . My lady yelled , " Wat ! " and flung the soap at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , to show the Welshman he could talk free with my lady . Then he strolled in his own time to loose the dog , while the merchant and his daughter and their guest went back into the kitchen . Wat hurried then , let Murdach go free , and rushed after them to see what happened . He almost crashed into 32  | my lady , who had stopped at the top of the three steps down inside . His Worship was halted at the bottom , and the Welshman was on the step between . " See , " the merchant was saying indulgently , " see the hussy ? The cook would fetch her a clout if he dared . " It was Blaunchette , the brazen one , with her forepaws on the table , engaged in nosing some meat . The cook watched balefully , while kitchen boys tending a goose on the spit had their heads turned almost backwards . " Now , Blaunchette , " the merchant said . " Let it be ! " But when , perverse , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Naughty ! " he said , as she settled down to toy with it . But Wat 's attention had gone to my lady , who was stroking at the Welshman 's head . He did not even seem to notice . There 's a man used to women , disdaining their attention by reason of having too much . Envy was strong in Wat again . They treated him as they treated Murdach , with fear , and stayed beyond his reach . He 'd heard of men who were fools for women , forever some wench 's victim . He 'd be such a one and gladly , if they would only pursue him . But he was ugly , his tones were rough and his words came out harsh . His legs were short , his nose was hooked , his hair all greasy cowlicks . Why should a man made as he was trouble to keep his body clean , or his chin shaven , or his hair cut ? Should he wear tight hose to show off misshapen legs ? " It 's fine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the Welshman notice her . " The journey 's dust is in the Thames . " Her father heard her speak , and turned to see her arrange a lock not set to her liking . " Be done with that ! " he roared . Instantly , Blaunchette seized up her prize and fled to the great hall . " I was but seeing if the wash had dried , " Constance answered impudently . " You 'll be wed this August , and that 's not soon enough ! " " I 'll not wed this August or any August to that grandsire , " she declared . " I 'll get to a convent first ! " " You 'll go to no convent ! I 'll have grandsons of you , mistress ! " " Ha ! You 'll get none from that old man , " she said . " Will I not ? With his fourth wife dead of her seventh child last year ? " it 33  | " I 'll poison him first , " she shrieked in a gust of temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were merrily off on a battle with the Welshman standing quietly between them , blank-faced , though Wat 's heart went to beating faster . No , no , he pleaded silently . If you will not have the old man , I 'll kill him , but do not provoke your father . He could do nothing now to aid her , and the Welshman did not care , but put his back to the wall and a foot across the stair between them , lounging . That was the way of gentry , to make sport of everything . A dark mood rushed on Wat as he remembered another quarrel in another kitchen ; a smoke-blackened greasy hole in a thieves ' inn , where his mother was cook , and more when a man had the money . He was twelve , or thereabouts , and they told him a real gentleman had come by , driven in by the snow . He rushed to tell his mother this exciting news and found the gentleman himself , with his mother . " Is this your whelp ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This . . . this . . . you 'd best drown it , woman ! " His mother flung the nearest missile at her child , then pursued him as he leaped and crouched away . She was black-toothed and dirty , but he had so unreasoning loved her . . . . A pot caught him a blow on the head as he sought to reach the door . It sent him reeling , too dazed to think or move . he staggered into a wall and went to his knees , and his mother came at him with a chunk of firewood snatched up . When he was conscious again , the gentleman was gone and she was snoring in a corner . Always before he 'd gone back to her after a beating , to the only human to whom he belonged , but he heard the gentleman laughing , or some such sound in his head . He did not go near her but crawled away instead , to the door , and rested there , then crawled again along the frozen ruts that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snowy meadow , leaving a trail like a snake , red-spotted , until he reached a fence where he pulled himself to his feet , leaned to rest , then staggered on . The inescapable memory choked him now , years after , while the quarrel cracked on and the Welshman studied his fingers . As if he knew he was watched , the Welshman 's head turned and caught his glance . Wat dropped his eyes .  | " I 'll have my way ! " my lady shrieked . The merchant 's neck swelled over his collar and his face was like raw meat . In a moment he would strike her . But the Welshman moved first . He seemed to sway forward and stand upright facing the merchant . He said nothing more . Did nothing more . But it almost numbed Wat 's brain . Whom should he aid ? The Welshman , his enemy , who would protect my lady ? Or His Worship , who might strike her , but was master of the house ? The moment of panic was resolved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent on the battle , now pulled something wrong and the goose crashed into the fire . The cook shouted and sprang . The merchant swung around with a bellow . The cook dragged the bird out with a poker , rolled it clear on the floor , flapped a cloth over it , and threw the red-hot dinner on a table , where he anxiously stripped off the fat that wrapped the bird . A fragrance surrounded them all , rising with the steam , to bring Blaunchette 's slim presence inquiring to the door . The cook was smiling over his undamaged bird when he saw her appear . His face changed and he reached again for his poker . Merchant or no merchant , he meant to defend this bird , though His Worship stood right there . But the red had faded from the merchant 's face . My lady turned sweet-toned . " Cooked with the fat of swine , " she said , seeing His Worship admire it , " and stuffed with apples and honey . We 'll brown it with butter and baste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instant it is done ! " the merchant finished . " Now , we 'll leave the kitchen to those who need it , and settle family matters another time . Blaunchette , not a tooth will you put in that goose . " He seized her by her cloth-of-gold collar , half lifted her from the floor , and dragged her into the great hall . " Robin ? " he inquired mildly . " A game of chess before dinner ? " Wat was horrified instantly . Robin ! Pet names , now . " ... and take that sword off , " came the merchant 's voice . " It 's only fit for tripping women in this house . " Wat looked through the door . The Welshman was taking off his sword , but very slowly , though the merchant had already flung his clattering on a chest . " I had thought to go out on business , " His Worship said , " but it 35  | will wait until we make bones of the goose . And so will your trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight in France . This afternoon will be time enough , and I 'll send Paul to guide you ! " Paul ! Wat was angry at this preferment . But it would be as well , he thought with disdain . Paul could keep nothing to himself , and he 'd tell all that passed . " Wat ! The chess pieces , " the merchant yelled across . " We 'll sit here in this sunny window . Wat ! Bring chairs ! " The Welshman got his own , and hung his sword on the back of it , easy to his hand . Chapter 5 LIKE most official documents , the Indenture was in French , which Robert read laboriously , while the bored clerk watched with superiority . This Indenture , made between the Kynge our Sovereign Lorde of the One Part , and Robert de Fayr f yell , Esquire , of the other parte : Witnesseth , that the sayde Robett is bound to our sayd Lorde the Kynge , to serve him for a wholl yere in a voiage whyche our Lorde the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleaseth God . . . commencing with the month of Juli next comyng , if hee then bee redy to make the sayd muster .

Details of how his loot must be shared with the king , what prisoners he might keep for ransom , and those that must go to the crown . With luck , he 'd have enough to pay for a knighting , and only as a knight would he return to Wales . In Witnesse of whyche thynges , the Indenture concluded , the a f orsayde Robbert has put his seal , Given at Westminster this xxviii day of June ... . The bored clerk dripped sealing wax upon the document . Robert set his seal ring firmly into the red blob . When he raised it , he was the king 's man , signed and sealed and sworn ; his loyalty belonged wholly now to King Henry the Fifth , three years on his shaky throne . Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paul brought the horses , and he mounted , still borne up by the signing . He followed Paul , scarcely noticing the hundreds of women around of all hues and nations , shouting their wares in diverse tongues . This was the worst stew of the city , at the southern end of London Bridge . Vaguely he heard the babble of nations , but he neither knew nor cared these stews were famous . Whatever any man wanted , no matter how strange , he would find it here . But Robert looked to his horse ; for now the beast was skittish , unused to these screeching crowds . The stream of traffic on London Bridge was a mad thing ; jostling and shouting and faces all about , struggling in and out of shops that lined the outer parts of the bridge . Robert would have liked to stop at the chapel in the very middle , to pray and give thanks for the signing , but Paul hurried on and never turned , and Robert knew he would lose himself in this sweltering press if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came off the north end of the bridge . Severed heads aloft on pikes . Traitors ' heads , displayed . One was bearded with the eyes turned upward , clotted blood still fresh on the stem of the neck . Robert fancied he had seen that face when it possessed a body , but Paul forced his way steadily through the crowd and there was no time to linger and think on it . And so they forged their way back to the merchant 's house , the great stone building topped by a tiled roof with a winch fastened there to the back . All lower windows facing the street were stoutly barred , with stained-glass panes , and a motto spelled out : I THANK THEE LORDE AND EVER SHAL , IT IS THE SHEEP HATH PAYED FOR ALLE . It was a great , expensive house , decorated with a gilt band of carved lambs gamboling among hawthorn , straight across the front at the height above the door , continuing along the top of the long stone wall that shut the courtyard away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door that opened a step above the street , was inset a plain shield bearing the device of a cross inside a circle , the merchant 's mark of Lewis Chapelle of London , known wherever ships took trade . A man did not need to know how to read to understand a thing was his . They stopped at the courtyard gate , and Wat Strongbow opened it to Paul 's shout . He had a surly look , like the mastiff chained to the wall . Robert dismounted inside and flung him the reins as Constance came skipping out to meet him . " Here 's one home at least , " she said , " and my father should come any moment . Sit in the great hall , Robin , and I 'll be with you soon . I have to watch the cook or he 'll have the sauce too mild . " She sent him out of the kitchen , and he walked to the row of arched windows and stared out at the side garden of roses , still borne up by the signing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long affair . Twelve years training in Wales , and Count Llewellyn had decreed that Robert must go home , for the last step was his knighting , and this a matter for his sire . Therefore , in the fall Robert rode back to the place where he was born , a stone manor set in a neglected wood , with barren fields around , for the serfs had long since run off to the cities . The house was somber , brooding , streaked with wet and unremembered . It seemed small and mean after the castle . Stones had fallen from the tower and lay mossy green among the weeds all  | around . The silence was broken only by the harsh cries of the ravens . The old man did not remember Robert . He had thought little enough of his only child , got in old age of a wife who died in gesine . He thought even less of Robert 's reappearance , for a knight was a great expense . With resentment the old man said it could not be afforded ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restlessly around the snowed-in ruin , while the old man sat in his oak chair before the fire , snoring or drinking , having long since forgotten youth and its ambitions . He looked only into the flames and what he saw was over long ago . What was to come he did not care , for death was his companion . Spring came at last , with green things bursting up through muddied snow . The roads were open , to horses if not to carts , and rumors of impending war came with wandering merchants . Henry the Fifth , by the Grace of God , King of England , was pressing for war with France . A young king for a new war , the merchants said , and disapproved . But Robert had known no other ruler in his life ; it had been Prince Henry governing Wales , and now it was King Henry governing England . If he wanted France also , it was natural . In Wales everyone wanted his neighbor 's lands . And Robert was ambitious also . Yet he waited still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think where his duty lay , in the home manor with the old man who did not want him , or with the king who needed loyalty but hated Lollards now , though he 'd had enough for friends when he was prince . Robert returned from such a ride in early summer to find his father in the great oak chair as if he had never moved . Except that this time he swung his head around . " The king 's messenger came by the woods ' road , " he stated dully . " King Henry is asking all his vassals to contribute . I said I had no money and nothing to sell . " God ! to grow so old all things were alike ! Let me die young , still eager , regretting bitterly the years I 'll lose ! " And , " the old man finished , " I must list what men I have who can bear arms for defense of the realm when the king is out of it . " " A home guard ? Not for me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . " " As you will , " his father said , without interest . " As you will . You 'll get no gold spurs of me. " . . . 39  | " La ! " Constance said . " You dreamer ! You 'll move from that place , or we 'll set the table atop you ! Johannis ! " She guided him out of the way . " My father is not yet home , " Constance shouted over the din and clatter of planks . " I can not think what keeps him . " " He started later than he planned , " Robert reminded her . " No doubt he 'll return that much later . " " Dame Margaret argues the same , " Constance said . So they dined with one place empty , and as the daylight faded , Robert saw that she grew worried . " This is a handsome goblet , " he said to distract her , fingering chased silver . " My father had it from the coronation feast , " she said , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . " He sat with the Aldermen of London , near enough to the king to see him well . " " IIow does the king look ? " Robert asked . " I 've never seen him . " " Brown-haired , " Constance said , reciting without interest . " Hazeleyed . A cleft in the chin . A high color . A scar , here . " She indicated a place by her left eye . " From an arrow wound at Shrewsbury that nearly killed him . " She had little thought for this , her manner said , but all for the lateness of the merchant . " Tall ? " Robert asked . " Tall ? " she inquired vaguely . " The king , " Dame Margaret prompted her . " Oh , the king . Nay . To your nose . No higher . " " Merry ? " " My father said at the feast you 'd think he was buried , not crowned . He sat alone in a marble chair on a dais with a gold canopy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father said no doubt he wished the party all in hell , for the king could not leave till the guests had done , and the feast went op forever . The servants were on horseback , and the nags so skittish with crowding , my father said , they were like to spill all on the diners ' heads ; but the king never noticed nor smiled . That was a night I worried about my father also . Drunk and coming through the streets by night , and the snow . oh , the snow ! I thought I 'd be an orphan , with a frozen man for a sire . I would he were home now ! " She looked up as Wat came to the table with the hangdog air he  | had in the house . He wiped the back of his hand across his mouth , and muttered something about Jesu . Jesu just tied up at the quay . " Jesu in ? " Dame Margaret asked from the end of the table . " But my father is not , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She went swiftly , with Dame Margaret clucking behind her . Opening doors at night was not a woman 's business , so Robert followed them . There was no one outside . Constance came slowly back to the table . " Now , " Dame Margaret said , " he started late and will return so . " " He would not be late tonight if he could avoid it , " Constance said . " Jesu 's in from Calais . " Her voice turned fretful . " He carries money too often , and too many know it . Wat , you should have gone with him ! " She spoke across the room . Robert glanced and saw a lumpier shadow , darker than the rest . The monstrously ill-favored knave had not left . How quietly he moved and stood ! It was a fact to be remembered . Robert was glad he 'd flung his saddlebags over his horse that morning when he 'd ridden to the palace . A varlet that silent was bound to be a thief , and God forbid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You fret like your King-at-Arms . There 's no cause yet for worry . We 'll make a time and you 'll be calm till then . We will not worry until the moon reaches around that window and touches the foot of his chair . Then indeed he would be too late . " Robert identified the chair she meant , a large one , carved , marked with a cross and circle in a shield , set in a shadow with a long streak of moonlight by it on the floor . " So the king has forsworn smiling ? " Robert asked , resuming as if the conversation had never been interrupted . " It seems so , " she said , trying to play the hostess . " But they 're seeking him a wife and that may make him merry . " " He wants no wife , " Dame Margaret contradicted flatly . " They 've tossed brides enough at his head , and he 's tossed them all back swifter . " " He may yet wed Catherine of France , " Constance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her father 's mad and she 's worse than emptyheaded , " Darne 41  | Margaret said , shocked . " God defend England from such a queen , to get mad sons for the realm . " " She 's but twelve years old , " Constance said , still trying valiantly . " She 'll grow wiser as she grows older . " " Let her grow older in France , " Dame Margaret said . " A Portuguese princess is what we need . That would be good for trade . " Constance did not answer , and silence fell over them . " Though a king can not choose his wife as he will , " Dame Margaret said , to make a sound in the huge , still room . " They 'll force him to marry , and I fear it will be Catherine in the end , and so does he . No wonder he brooded at his coronation feast . " Dame Margaret poured more wine and it gurgled . Robert looked at the moonlight creeping nearer the chair . " His throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too many say Henry should have gone to the Church and his brother Thomas to the throne . " " In Wales , " Robert said , " they favor the Earl of March . " " And well he knows it , " Dame Margaret said . " He 's no fool . He had old enemies at the coronation feast to show he would not carry grudges . He 'll have peace in England to go to war the faster , thrusting aside the prophecy . " " What prophecy ? " Robert asked . " Why , there was a two-day blizzard when he was crowned . It snowed so hard and deep , men froze in the street , and many lords never reached Westminster at all to swear their loyalty . Therefore , it was prophesied that King Henry 's reign would be as the snow , full of violence and short besides , for the snow was gone in a week . " " He 's but twenty-seven , " Robert protested . " Yet he pardons men who try to murder him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is riot the description of a long-lived man . Constance ! Not to the door again ? Your father will be in a temper when he finds you opened it at night . The streets are dangerous now . " " I am thinking just that , " Constance said from the doorway , " and that my father is out among them . " The moonlight touched the leg of the merchant 's chair . They were not all they seemed in this house , and something was afoot tonight to which the merchant should have hurried . Robert was full of suspicion ,  | but he was a guest and a man and the girl was worried . He pushed back his chair and rose . " All excuse is at an end , " he said . " Therefore , tell me the way he would take and I will find him . " Chapter 6 ROBERT FAIRFIELD was no coward , but he 'd not have Wat Strongbow behind him in a pitch-black street , so he sent the knave ahead to show the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stableboy had a cudgel as thick as a wrist in one hand , and with the other he held the mastiff Murdach on a thick rope doubled through his collar , so loosing one end would free the beast to run . The streets were black tunnels hereabouts . The houses were tall and slammed tight together , and since each story overlapped the lower the top floors almost bridged the streets . Robert could not see where he put his feet . Night dampness crawled along the slimy cobbles with the smell of dirt and fish and tide . " Where 's the watch ? " he asked once . " Against a door with a wench , every man , " Wat replied . " Here 's Candlewick Street . It 's wider . " A little moonlight forced its way down to illumine their way and keep them from falling into the sewage ditch . They were in an area of old houses and buildings used for storage . Wat halted before an unlit bulk looming into the night sky . " Our warehouse , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arrows from the north today . " Robert drew his sword with a soft hiss of steel . " Stay here , " he said , " and see if any run out . " Ile walked warily into an alley beside it , after trying the door . All was silent and deserted . He made a complete circuit , overleaping a fence at the back , and returned . " Nothing , " he said to the waiting man and dog . " Is there another place the Worshipful Alderman might stop ? " 43  | " The Pope 's Head Tavern in Lombard Street , " Wat hazarded . " He knows the landlord well , and often stops there when he 's late . " Robert gestured , and Wat took the lead again . No light showed anywhere , for all fires must be covered when the curfew rang . A forgotten fire could mean a conflagration among the wooden tenements , and a slum burned down by morning . They passed dark churches with spires high against the stars ; cemeteries that were pools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what lay within besides the silent dead . Once two men slunk across their path , but Murdach snarled , and when they came to where the men had been , there was nothing but a cough heard in some alley . They turned into Lombard Street . And in the center lay a fallen torch , still burning . Wat went to it . " I know the mark , " he said . " It 's one of ours . " " Loose the dog , " Robert told him . " Tell him to find his master . " Murdach stood a moment , hard-chested and belligerent , with a long line of slobber dangling from his jaw . Then he leaped away , heavy and slow and exceedingly dangerous , searching shadows and on the hunt . " He has no nose for trailing , " Wat said , " nor Blaunchette 's speed in a fight , but he 's diligent and will attack whatever appears . " Murdach paused on the very words , to stare into an alley . Suddenly he leaped , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran after him instantly , and were as instantly beset . Robert had no time to pick opponents , but fought whatever stood before him . The first knave fled when the sword but pricked him , and was a swift shadow illumined at the end of the alley and a sound of running feet . Another rascal came from nowhere . Robert tripped him , and stuck him on the ground . Then against the light at the end of their battleground he saw Wat engaged , and a third man coming up behind him . He stepped lightly forward and struck hard . He heard a sharp intake of breath , smelled onions on it . Wat and his man went crashing down , and Wat bestrode the other and burst his skull against the cobbles , while Robert 's ruffian staggered back and back , still spitted , dragging sword and swordsman to the alley 's mouth , where Robert heaved back on the weapon . It snapped , set hard in bone . The knave fell backwards into Lombard Street . Robert flung down the useless hilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its scabbard at his back .  | A great bulk was outlined now against the light from Lombard Street . Robert almost struck it until he realized it was the merchant , so he stabbed the other , who screamed and fled . One more yell and the last of them fled after the screaming man , with Murdach bellowing after . Wat yelled , " Murdach ! " then pounded in pursuit . " Who 's that ? " the merchant 's voice demanded . " Paul ? " " Robin Fairfield . " " I thought that too bold for Paul , " the merchant said , and came to the light , where he turned his back . " Cut those thongs , if you will , Robin . " Robert cut them and sheathed his dagger again , while the merchant rubbed his sore wrists . " Where 's the dog ? " " Wat 's after him . " The merchant kicked thoughtfully at the body of the man Robert had killed . The ruffian lay on his back in a welter of spreading blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dead hands clutched it yet , as if to tug it out . There was a gleam on one of the fingers . Robert picked up the warm , limp , bloody hand . In Wales one did not waste good loot on dead men . He pried the jewel off . Then , bending again , he picked up the varlet 's sword . " Nicked like a saw , " he said , " and balanced like a rock . An ax were a better weapon . " He flung it with a clatter to the alley , disappointed . " I will match yours for you , and more , " the merchant said . " That 's but justice . Here 's Wat , returning . Did you run all over London , " he inquired , " to take so long ? " Wat made no answer but scuffled to hold Murdach , who reared up and struggled and would return to a fight . Robert picked up the torch , still burning in Lombard Street , and they walked on by its ill light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alderman was with them , and it was the law that honest men abroad after curfew on emergencies must carry torches to prove they were not prowlers . All London lay inert and silent , dark except for the stars , the moon , the beacon fire in the spire of St. Mary-le-Bow , and the pinpoint of their torch . The furious battle brought no investigation . If the householders heard the uproar , they remained prudently in bed behind their shutters and bolts . As for the watch , it never came at all . 45  | " Welladay , " the merchant said , before his own door , " at least they got no money of me . As for my gelding , it ran off and will come home when it is pleased to do so . Wat , there were seven of them in the alley . This is a fighting man , for all his pretty bells . " " Seven men in a small space , " Robert said , honestly , " and more disposed to run than fight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knocked upon the door . It opened too promptly to suit him , and he shouted at his daughter for flinging doors wide when no men fit to wield swords were in the house . As for Constance , she did not listen but bolted the door and came running after them into the great hall and the candlelight . There she yelped at their gory looks . " Be quiet ! " the merchant commanded . " It 's only a little blood and none of it ours . Wat , is that dog injured sorely ? No , well throw him in the river and cleanse him , he 's tracking blood on the floor . Constance , be useful . Tell the cook I 'm hungry . Dame Margaret , see to our nightgowns and menservants to attend us . " Dame Margaret hustled off , but Constance stood staring at Robert anxiously . He backed away , protesting she would stain her gown . " But your hand is hurt , " she said . " You hold it closed and it 's bloody . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fist , it holds a bauble for a lady . " Her eyes glowed . " For me ? " Then she pounced at him , and pried his fingers open . " Ah , " she cried out , greedy . " A ring . A balas ? " She caught up the expensive silk of her skirt to wipe it clean . " A balas ! Taken of a thief by moonlight . I will cherish this pale ruby , Robin . Jesu , I would I had seen the fight that took it ! " Dame Margaret came up behind her , frowning at this behavior . " Your Worship , " she said , " the menservants are coming , and I 've ... " here she looked hard at Constance , who 'd been derelict in this assigned duty , " . . . roused the cook also . " " Then get to bed , " the merchant said , and when his daughter would only stand trying on her ring to see which finger it suited , he raised his voice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you ? " Constance dallied off then , trailing behind her aunt , looking at her  | balas , though it did not capture all her attention , for she turned to grin like an imp at Robert as she closed her chamber door . " Never a thought to my welfare , " the merchant proclaimed piteously . " I could have been killed in the streets . She did not inquire if I was wounded . " He subsided into grumbles , and at length began to laugh . They stood upon footcloths before the fire and were washed by menservants , who put the nightgowns on them ; black silk for the merchant and garnet ' silk for the guest , trimmed with ermine dyed the color of a salmon 's flesh . By then the table had been put up by sleepy kitchen boys , and candles brought in profusion . Wine was poured . Wat came in and whispered in the merchant 's ear , and walked away with a glance for Robert that slid off guiltily . A yawning kitchen boy came with honied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a basket of strange tawny-colored fruit . " Oranges , " the merchant said , seeing Robert look with interest . " St. Joseph brought them to Calais , and transhipped to Jesu , for we like them in this house . Wat ! Did the searchers see them ? " Wat said hoarsely that no man had set foot on the ship , and the customs searchers would only come in the morning . It seemed to Robert that more was meant than stated , but he paid no attention outwardly . But this time he had seated himself with his back to the fireplace , facing the hall and the merchant with his black beetling brows , black beard , and long hair following the fashion of an older day . The man was masked in hair . The merchant suddenly snapped his fingers . " I am reminded . A sword to replace that broken in my behalf . " He rose instantly and stalked off to his chamber with a candle . Robert heard him fumbling in some chest within . Then he returned across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the midst of the many candles , and all the flames bowed abruptly . An omen ! Robert caught in his breath . His Welsh blood saw the sign ! " Take it , use it , " the merchant said , " but bring it back when the fighting 's done . It is not yet mine and I must answer for its safety till it is . " The sword was not ordinary . The hilt was wrought by the gold-47  | smith 's art into the form of three ostrich feathers , unique , beautiful , strange . Robert had never seen a real ostrich feather , only stiff drawings on shields , but now he knew how one should look , and yet , it would fit the hand . The goldsmith who had created this hilt had used a model ; every shaft of every soft feather was here in precious metal . The artist was long-gone dead or blind ; for those who followed the goldsmith 's trade lost their sight early from the smoke of quicksilver , or turned madmen , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his great gift behind . He had left this sword . Robert reached for it ; then dropped his hand to the linen cloth and left the jewel untouched . " I have it on security for a loan , " the merchant said , biting into cold mutton with relish . He saw only its value in crowns and marks and that was great enough . " If it is not redeemed in a year and a day and a month , I will give it to you utterly , in exchange for my life this night . " He could not touch it . Something cold ran in his blood . " Take it , " the merchant said , impatient with this dawdling . " Take it ! " With a sharp motion , Robert picked it up . He drew the blade , and it hissed free . What was the message it spoke ; the portent ; the meaning ? He held the sword out . Balanced finely , the best steel . The firelight glittered red as blood along the blade . That was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among swords with his blood ! He knew it , and he did not care . The merchant threw down the bone of the mutton and reached for a honied bun . " It was King Henry 's jewel , " he said , " when he was Prince of Wales . " Chapter 7 ROBERT sat on the bench against the wall that shut out Thames Street . From there he could oversee the courtyard and the quay where Jesu was unloading . Bales sailed upward into the capacious third story of the house , swung by the squeaking winch on the roof through double doors that opened into air .  | The merchant basked in a sunny place , his presence the peacekeeper , for otherwise sailors and stableboys fought . Constance was sewing with her maids , and Dame Margaret was watching the washing of clothes at the stairs to the river . It was peaceful enough ; diligent pursuit of profit and cleanliness in a kindly household . So it seemed by day . But by night they were like owls , awake and flying after prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a strange , shy visitor who had not appeared until Robert was long abed , and given much time to sleep . Wat sat on the stairhead guarding when Robert risked opening the door a crack , sensing someone below . He heard a murmuring . The voices were not clear , but in one the intonation was distinctive . It was good northern French . A Frenchman below , and the two countries on the edge of war . He deciphered talk of a hundred thousand gold crowns . They were setting a price , and that the price of betrayal in high places . Who 'd give it ? The French were frugal , and might think it cheaper to murder a king than fight a war . Wat on the stair grew restless . Robert closed the door . Nor opened it again that night , for reason of Wat 's settling outside against the very panel . A hundred thousand gold crowns . That went far beyond the price of poor Wat Strongbow 's murderous service . Robert 's eyes drifted speculatively to where butts had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lads were shooting a match with the stableboys to decide the better archers . The garden was full of the sound of buzzing arrows , mingled with screams from the winch , the cursing of sailors , yells from men within the ship , and the gentle cooing of the white doves that strutted softly at his feet . Robert fed them idly with bits of bread he crumpled in his fingers . All the soft white company attended him , though great Murdach was dangerously near , tied fast to his iron ring . The birds fluttered and flew with flashing wings to Robert 's hand , feathers aglare in the sun as they balanced on his fingers and pecked crumbs from his palm . Constance glanced over frequently , but there was another watcher too , and not so pretty as she . Wat Strongbow paid little attention to his archery . As often as Robert withdrew his attention from Jesu and the soaring bales , or the red-legged doves clinging with beating wings to 49  | his tanned fingers , so often did he catch Wat looking hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Lewis Chapelle had no look of trickery now , for all he plotted with Frenchmen while Englishmen slept . He sat on his chair in the sun with Blaunchette half off and half on his lap by reason of his great belly and her great length . They were playing at her being a lap-dog , and the merchant made much of her , petting and patting and promising if St. Joseph came safely home from this venture to Venetia , there would surely be a collar of pretty stones for her . Robert chanced to glance at Murdach when a dove strayed too near the beast . But Murdach saw no dove to be snapped up , nor anything but the merchant with his Blaunchette . The mastiff stood square at the end of his rope , and queerly , sadly , unexpectedly , out of his ugliness , beyond the torn ears and scarred hide and raw wounds from the night before , from some deep , unsuspected softness and pitiful need , came a low , longing whine , a small crying wrenched from a fierce heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it . " Now pretty , now hussy , " the merchant said , and teased Blaunchette by pulling her ears . Murdach cried , and Robert was all compassion . " Here , Murdach , " he called softly . " Will you take second best with me ? " And he tossed a bit of the sweet bread over . Murdach snarled and showed his fangs . The merchant heard that quick enough and hitched round in his chair on the instant . " Snarling ? " he inquired . " At guests ? Down , you brute ! Or I 'll take a rope and teach you manners ! " Murdach flattened to the ground , abject at having sinned , his shy attempt at affection crushed . The merchant grunted , and faced front again . Blaunchette licked his face and had him back in humor soon , laughing at her . She threw back her lovely , graceful head , as if she laughed too , while very quietly , great Murdach crouched on his belly and cried in his throat . Sadly , Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was watched again . He snapped his head up this time , and caught Wat Strongbow barefaced . There was no masking it . The knave was staring . Wat did not drop his eyes this time . Robert 's mouth tightened . Perhaps it was the ugly face , the look , Robert never knew .  | But he remembered luckless Murdach , not as evil as he seemed . Tentatively , Robert smiled . Wat Strongbow grimaced shyly , and Robert guessed it was meant for a smile . " That looks to be a fine bow , " he called , for want of something to say . Wat came to him hesitantly , proffering the weapon . Robert showed his surprise at the stoutness of the bow , almost shocked by the abnormal strength it would demand . Wat wiped his hand nervously across his mouth . " I 've shot at the mark all my life , sir . " " You have a Welsh look , " Robert said . " Do you come from there ? " " From under a stone for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was got of a tavern wench by a passing stranger . In the year of the plague I came here and they took me in . My breeding , sir , is a ban-dog 's  --  unguessed at . " He looked down at his toes . " It was my life you saved last night , sir , as well as . . . " He gestured with his chin , and Robert realized suddenly there was no love lost there . " Only I can not discharge my debt with such as . . . " He jerked his chin again , to indicate King Ilenry 's sword . " I 'd have had a knife in my back , " Robert said , " if you had not been there . " Wat stood , without words . A shouting made them both look up . It was Wat 's turn to shoot again . He ducked in a clumsy bow and stepped up to the mark . Immediately Constance left her women and came to sit by Robert with her embroidery needle still in her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking with Wat , " she said . " Did he offend you that you called him ? " " I admired his bow , " Robert said . She seemed relieved . " He 's ugly and he 's forward , and he stared at you , I know , yet he but watched admiring . " " Admiring ? " " Have you not noticed he 's lost his shaggy look ? He 's close-shaven today , instead of bristling . He 's pulled his hose tight , and cut his hair , and this morning he swam in the river . I screamed at him for years and never accomplished improvement , yet one street fight and you 're the hero . He has need of one . He 's not liked in the household . You heard them jeer just now when he missed the mark ? I never knew 51  | him to miss before ; but this morning he cares nothing for the match . Before , he had to best all corners . He 's found his hero and lost his aim ! Robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is his misfortune and turns away trust . Therefore , let me speak for him , since he can not and there is no other who will . He 's tired of the household and would go adventuring . He 'd die for me , but hates a woman to order him . Robin , when you go to France , you must take three followers to go as a gentleman . My father , I think , will offer men from our household . If he does , and you choose , I beg you , choose Wat Strongbow first of all if you would please me . " Her face seemed full of concern for Wat , but Robert did not trust it altogether . With plotting he had come to manhood amid great treachery that had often as fair a face . Yet he inclined his head , though warily . " Sometimes your face can not be read , " Constance said . " What are you thinking ? " " Of nothing , mistress , " he said , " and therefore nothing appears . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Heartless , " she said . Her face turned impish . " Therefore ... let us be great friends ! " Then she leaped to her feet , alarmed by her own words , and skipped hastily back to her handmaids . She glanced once to Wat as she sat , and Wat glanced at her and away . No word was spoken , but the message was given and received . Wat knew he was going to France . His aim improved . The last of the arrows were shot ; the match concluded . The neighbor lads drifted out of the garden with shouts of retribution due another day . The stableboys crowded into the stables , yelling of thirst and victory . No doubt they 'd go out the other side into a small dirt court which they frequented as their private yard . They 'd drink beer , reshoot the match , and brag . Wat might boast of going adventuring abroad . A sentence here , another added , while they thought themselves unheard . A man could read much from a little . Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some swans floating there , going double with their reflections . He spoke briefly with Dame Margaret at her washing , flung the last of his sweet bread to the great white birds , and wandered along the steps toward a grape arbor that stood on the far side of the yard at the top of the steps , backed by thick lilac bushes , behind which was the stableyard for the lads who lived there . Under the arbor was a stone bench . Robert sat ,  | elbows on knees , as if looking over the water ; being quiet to keep his bells from telling of his presence . Behind the lilac bushes a jangle of voices shouted of triumph . Then a shadow fell over him . IIe raised his eyes . Constance stood there , bright-eyed . He smiled welcome and rose politely . " It 's a forest overhead , " she said . " Leaves . Few grapes and those sour , but it makes a pleasant place to sit apart . " She slapped idly at a spray of leafy vine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time , her foot seemed to catch on some flagging , she stumbled and fell forward . He caught her . She was soft and warm and he did not think and kissed her . She moved her head back a little , surveyed him with a wise look . " Sir Knave , " she said , " you 've had much practice at this sport . " " And you , Mistress Constance ? " " Was it the lady of the silver comb ? " she inquired . " Was it the apothecary 's son , who dawdled in the garden before and gave me marvelous black looks ? " " A man with a quick tongue is a man who 's been much around ladies . " " There was little to do in our country castle , " he said , " but play chess or flirt . " " Chess , " she said . " You 've lost three times to my father , and he 's indifferent at the game . " She disentangled herself firmly and sat at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing . Ah , he liked her , despite her imperious nature . She was warmhearted and loving , and her kisses , judged by the one she 'd tossed him , would drive no man away . Yet he feared her , also , for he thought on her too often and sought to excuse her nightwalking , when he knew well enough she did what she did with a will . It was as well the Indenture was signed and he could not stay . Abruptly Constance moved closer and put her arm confidingly through his . " I do not want that grandsire to wed , " she whispered , like a naughty child with secrets . " Robin , I have a better dowry , " she said , very slowly , " than a nobleman 's daughter . " He was sorry it had come to this . But she was headstrong and indulged . She would reach for what she wanted . " You know nothing of me , " he pointed out . " I know all that I desire . You befriended Wat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue of all in a husband . You are merry , too , which makes a happy house . Also you are bold , to make a safe one . " She raised her hand and touched his face , so gently . " That you are handsome is the will of God , added to the rest . " " Mistress Constance , " he said , " I thank you and will remember what you have said , but I can not stay . " She dropped her hand from his face and her dark eyes flashed . " So it 's the lady of the silver comb who 's bewitched you ! And how many men has she been with since you left ? " " None , " he said . He dismissed explaining what she so gravely misunderstood . " How do you know what she does , so far away in Wales ? " " She 's not in Wales , " he said , " for she left the castle when I did , and fled back to her brother in France . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems to me that 's where you 're going . " " With King Henry , " he reminded . " Ha ! " she said , and tossed her head . " You may go with King Henry , but will you stay with him ? " She pulled her arm from under his and flounced back to the far end of the bench . " Robert Heartless . They knew how to call you in Wales . I 'll marry my old man and when I 'm a widow I 'll find another husband , black-haired as Satan . These flaxen-heads are light of hair and head , and fickle as a wind and cold as winter ! " Her anger was hot with jealousy , and she tried to burn . She and her father quarreled readily , and she had never learned to hold her tongue . Robert said nothing . Should he explain she had no rival , and so encourage her to defy her father by refusing to marry the old man ? Constance wet her lips with her tongue , almost spoke again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing for her . She moved uneasily , disconcerted by his failure to answer her bitter taunt . Her face grew anxious . She feared she 'd gone too far . She would make amends , but did not know how . She squirmed and twisted her fingers and glanced sideways at him . The sounds in the garden seemed to swell . The stableboys behind the lilac bushes were pushing one another about and gossiping . Wat 's voice rose above them all , exultant . .. . but I would not be King Henry for such a price ! A crown 's no  | payment ! " Roars of knowing laughter from the others . " Here 's Paul . Paul ! The beer 's gone . Drink water and die of fever ! " " There 's beer or better be , " Paul said roughly . " I 've been working while you 've been swilling , and if you 've had it all I 'll cut your throat and drink your blood ! " " Sweet Paul , " Wat said , with false solicitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I never trust you or your questions , " Paul said bluntly . " Move over and give me room to sit . " " Chance an answer , Paul , " Wat urged . " Chance it ! Would you be king and change places with our Henry ? " " Willingly , you clod , " Paul said . " I 'd never lift a finger again . " Screams of raucous laughter , as the stable lads took their own meaning , and Paul saw he was the fool . " I 'll take this rock to your head , Wat , " he said , " if you mock me . " " It 's a joke , Paul , a joke . " " I see no joke , " Paul said , growing furious . " If it 's my accent , I 'll strangle you with your own bowstring , dwarf ! You reek of the gutter , but do not stand so high ! " There was instant scuffling . A peacemaker intervened hastily . " Soft ! Soft ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around ? " " I 'll kill him , " Paul said . Another scuffle , wilder now , and cries as they were separated . " Irishman ! " Wat spat . " Your people run naked in your land ! " " At least I know my father ! " Paul snarled back . " Your mother brought you to see him hung ! " Wat yelled . Peacemakers again , redoubling their efforts . It was hastily explained as only a joke and no cause for affray . " Name me that joke , " Paul demanded . " Make me laugh ! " " The joke was only this , " someone explained . " The king sleeps alone , and when you said ? " " Go to the devil , you liar , " Paul said . " It 's true ! " Wat was defending his gossip . " I had it of John the Brewer , and he had it of a guard for Bishop Courtenay , King Henry 's friend . The bishop swears the king has been continent since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Dear God ! Tie a stone about my neck and drown me in the river first ! " 55  | Did knaves dare talk so of the king , poking scurrilous fun at a man who had no defender here ! Did they dare ! Henry had been a gallant prince and was an honest sovereign , and this cruel jesting was not his due ; to be a butt for stableboys . Constance caught at Robert 's wrist , distracting him , as if she guessed at Welsh blood brewing a storm despite the Saxon heritage . " It 's only gossip , " she was assuring him . " No harm is meant . " Robert jerked his wrist free . " ... and the night before his coronation , " Wat said avidly , " he called in a priest and made confession , and needed all the dark hours for remembering his sins . Now he lives like a monk , and why should any man want a crown if he can have no joy of it ? " " You 've made that up ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to stout lads like us to make more soldiers . " He guffawed . Robert lunged straight through the lilacs . A stableboy fell off the end of a bench with fright , and Wat swung around with a jerk . " If any man will malign my sovereign , " Robert said distinctly , " let him dare it to my face . " Wat 's smile vanished , and he looked evil . " It was Bishop Courtenay who said it , sir . " " What the king does is not for your amusement . " " And what the king does not ? " Robert slapped him sharply across the face . Then Constance shoved between them . " Wat , move back . Robert , my father is in the courtyard , and if he comes here , it will turn I 'm to blame for all . Paul , if you sneak to my father with this tale , you 'll have my displeasure . Robin , please . I can not order you , but will you hear my plea ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it was her household and he her guest , and he had lunged into this unseemly situation without consideration . He had never flared up so before to lose his head . But he could not bear to hear the king maligned so roughly . It had stirred his wild Welsh blood , and the calmer Saxon strain lost ground . " I 'll have Wat beaten , " Constance said , after they had passed her father 's chair .  | " Nay , " he said bitterly . " I was the fool and know it . No man should suffer for that but myself . " Chapter 8 AS THEY supped that night Robert announced from a deep silence that he must be in Southampton by the fifth day of July , that he was grateful for their hospitality but must leave on the morrow . Constance gave a squeak . Dame Margaret gasped . The merchant looked between them . " Did you think he would stay forever ? " he inquired . " Now , Robin , we ca n't have you setting out like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman with a retinue . Have you thought on this matter ? " " I 'll find three men in Southampton , " Robert said , very stiffly . " You 'll find three men in London , " the merchant amended . " You 'll pick three lads from this house , and I 'll supply the horses . " " Your Worship , I can not accept it , " Robert said . " Pride fills no stomach , " the merchant said . " I hold my life valuable and will make due return . " " I have the sword , for which I am grateful , " Robert said . " Loaned , " the merchant reminded him . " You 'll take three lads or l 'll hold it as an insult . Do you think my life worth nothing ? Before God , " he roared , " I 'll teach you better ! " Constance said hastily , " Robin , choose the men ! " The merchant took another tack . " Robin , I have no son , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this house . " Robert hesitated . The merchant had his own reasons , he was sure . It might be as well to learn them . " John , " he said . " Gladly , " the merchant said . " For the second ? " Constance looked at Robert , and tried to signal . " Walter , " he said . Constance frowned , reminding of the promise to choose Wat . But could the knave be trusted now ? Was he forgiving ? " For the third ? " the merchant asked . 57  | " I had not thought . " " Take Paul , " the merchant suggested . " He speaks French . " " Wat speaks it better , " Constance said . " He 's been in France , besides . " Her father frowned this time . " And he does not carry tales , " she added . " No , but he carries a knife , " her father said . " I doubt he can be trusted , his feelings are too tender and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Paul . " A kitchen boy serving them slammed down a goblet and streaked for the door . " Off to the stables , " the merchant said , looking after him . " To tell who 's going to France . They 've talked of nothing but that since I said that three might go if you 'd have them . " Had Wat bragged that he was chosen , since his mistress had assured him ? Paul would drive that home . " Now , " the merchant said , turning businesslike , " I give nothing for nothing . With the retinue go letters I must have delivered in France . " " What do they deal in ? " Robert asked . " Merchandise , " the merchant said . " My business must go on despite a war . " " It will not come to war , " Constance insisted . " The French king 's mad , his Dauphin spits blood , and their lords are like wolves at each other . They must have peace . " " While King Hal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue the war . His policy demands it , and his parliament backs him . Meanwhile , I must get a cargo for Holy Mary , lying empty at Ostend wasting money by the bag as she sits anchored . " " King Henry will give her a cargo fast enough , " Robert suggested . " Transporting soldiers ? You 're tangled in loyalty and expediency , two things that seldom agree . I am not so troubled . I 'll not dirty my ship with soldiers . They 'd fight with my sailors , and there 's a man killed and my ship confiscated by the crown , for the ship is blamed if a man dies on her . Nay , Robin , I 've done my duty , lending money . " He had grace enough to grin in his beard . " . . . against good security , of course . Constance , a sulky look does not improve you . ' When you are married , I hope you will be meeker . Your future husband 's eager . I 'll set a date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " I will not marry him . " " And I tell you that you will . No more argument ! Robin 's off to a war , and you to a churching . " She stood up at her chair . " I will not marry him ! " The merchant did not move , " I am master in this house , " he said . " You must obey me and you will . I am determined on this marriage . " Constance burst into tears and ran for her chamber . Dame Margaret rose in a flurry of skirts and went off clucking after her . The merchant sighed and leaned back in his chair . " And weeping can not change it , " he said , with pity and regret . Though the quarrel was a bitter one , the merchant and his daughter patched the breach , for late in the night they passed by Robert 's chamber . He sat up in bed as he heard them go . He had opened the letters given him to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He dared not take them to a priest to read , for fear of what they might contain . If treason were within , and his belongings searched , the Bible would prove him a Lollard and hang him . What then must he do next ? He would not deliver what he could not understand , and there was little chance of translation . He reached beneath the covers where he kept King Henry 's sword . Moonlight came through the window to illuminate its hilt . It made a weird brightness , a glow , a misty ... Robert went suddenly cold . It seemed as if a damp mist spread to surround him and he could see mistily within .. . . His mother was Welsh . The race had magical powers . She had stared , they told him , at things that were not there . She stood , when she was young in Wales , and listened . He had his mother 's nature , they said ; she had bequeathed much of herself . And tonight , now , he felt this strangeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this house , this London , and carried him far away . He clasped the hilt of the sword , and it seemed he was near to the king . The night is full of betrayal . The waning moon is the ill portent. ' tonight one walks to meet another who travels by her dying light . Someone near the king . His price is reached . The money 's paid . And King Henry is betrayed ! Ile saw no more , he knew no more . The mist seemed to float back 59  | and away , and left him sitting there , breathing as if he had fought . King Henry had a trick , they said , of ever looking backwards . He liked no man behind him , and well might he be wary , for there had been assassins enough but none with the courage to face him . Ambush from behind was the king 's lot , or poison in a cup . Wherever he is tonight , God grant him a true man to guard him . Robert waited tensely until at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed beneath his door . Let them go down . Let them sleep . Tonight he would be abroad the last of all . If a Frenchman lay above , they 'd find him a body by morning . Robert flung back the covers and reached for his sword . Then he waited , with the weapon buckled over the cold silk of his gown , waited with the patience learned in Wales . At last , he stepped out into the corridor . Black quiet was over all , yet it seemed as if the house itself was wakeful yet . The baleful light of the treacherous moon shone through the tall and pointed windows , marking their patterns aslant on the floor of the empty hall . All seemed clear . He went back and lit his candle from a last ember in the bed of the fireplace , and emerged again to listen and then to climb upward in the stairway like a tunnel . The little candle he carried wavered like an unsteady pinnacle of light , stretching long and crouching short ; the smell of wax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small sound ! He flattened himself to the wall , but his own candle blinded him to all below , so he went on . The upper corridor was plain and narrow , with rough doors on either side shutting away rooms that were compartments to store bales , until there was a door of oak with an iron lock . It would take a battering ram to force it . Robert tried the room on one side , but the common wall was perfect . He tried the room on the other side , and as he moved among the bales with his candle high toward the barrier he saw ' a loose plank . He set down his candle , hooked his fingers in the broken place and heaved backwards with all his weight . The board ripped away with a tortured squall . He stopped , appalled at the noise , and listened , but nothing stirred . They were , after all , two floors below . So he resumed . There was a piece of tall furniture blocking the other side , ample reason they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder against it , and flung his strength toward it . The great chest squealed and shifted , and he eeled through the opening  | he made , thrusting the candle before . There were no windows ; and no hidden Frenchmen . There was a table , two chairs , some half-used candles , and a cloth such as a dog might bed on . The only other furniture was the heavy cupboard . Robert opened it , puzzled . There were a few books within . Two in Latin . The third in English , the vulgar tongue , and that he deciphered slowly . The Lan-tern of Light . Holy Mary ! He seized another book below . A Bible ! Forbidden ! Contraband ! There was enough in here to send all the household to the stake for heresy ! Before God ! They were Loll'ards in this house ! He grinned with pure delight . He had suspected assassins and found fellow heretics . He had so carefully concealed his Bible , and they had so carefully hid theirs ! He pushed their splendid book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , he heard a lock grate , and jumped to extinguish his candle . He was too late , the oaken door flung inward . Filling it was the merchant , with death in his eyes and a sword in his hand . Behind him stood Wat Strongbow , holding gleaming candles and an ax . " I had liked you well , " the merchant said , reproachful . " You have nothing to fear from me , " Robert said . " I 'm as Lollard as you . They 'd burn me at the same stake and save fuel . " The merchant moved in , but Robert did not back . " Send Wat , " he said . " Let him look beneath my pillow , and bring the Bible I 've hid there in a leather skin . It is not so elegant as yours , but twice as perilous . My name 's writ in . " The merchant paused , as a bull before it charges , " Wat . Go down . " The knave went . " If you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand before you . If you think to flee , Blaunchette holds your bolthole . " Robert glanced back and glimpsed the white hound by the cupboard . Her eyes glittered , and the hairs rose on his neck . " She 'll rip out your throat for a snap of my fingers , " the merchant said , quite pleasantly . " So do not move , Welshman . I 'll take no chance with my daughter 's life . " Robert stood very still . The merchant also . They listened to their own breathing until Wat came again , panting up the steps with a bundle of pages he thrust at the merchant . He 'd come back . He could have said the Bible was not there and 61  | had revenge for his slap . Yet he had returned . Robert stared at him , but Wat would not look up . Chapelle riffled through the pages awkwardly , by reason of holding his sword . " God have mercy ! " he exclaimed , and " By all the Holy Angels ! St. George be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name writ in besides ! Wat , he carries his death warrant with him , and he King Henry 's man . Did ever anyone make trouble for himself like this ? King Henry 's man and Lollard too ? Let me look at this strange being . Has he two heads to hold two loyalties ? Robin , either you are the one or the other . You may never be both . " " Nevertheless , " Robert said , " that is how I stand . " " You 'll not stand long then , " the merchant said grimly . " One hint to the king , and you 're dead . He let them sentence Oldcastle to the stake and Oldcastle was his dearest friend . He 's pious ! " " But Oldcastle escaped , for all that , " Robert reminded him . " I know he 's running free in Wales right now . " " An outlaw , " the merchant pointed out , " with a price on his head , and the stake waiting when he 's captured . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wall . " You 've torn my house apart , " he declared . " What did you seek ? " " Assassins . Frenchmen . Spies . I 've heard you come up here by night and I know you 've had strangers in after dark . " " You 've the ears of a fox , and sleep like a sinner , lightly . We came to read our Bible , and as for night callers , Lollards hang together , and merchants smuggle . When it comes to French , I have naught to do with them , save take my profits . " " A hundred thousand golden crowns ? " Robert inquired . " You heard that also ? If you know that much , I 'll tell a little more . I bought a French duke for my king , to keep him in his duchy when his own king calls him . Merchants may go where heralds may not . Come , I 'll lock my door again and fix the wall tomorrow . Softly down the stairs . Constance sleeps like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for twenty men fighting to the death in her chamber , but she might come inquiring as we go down on tiptoe . " The merchant led the way with the candles . Robert followed , and Wat came last of all . Halfway down the tunneled stair , Robert paused and Wat was forced to stop .  | " Wat ? I wondered if you 'd return with the Bible , or say it never was and take revenge . " Wat 's eyes glittered in the candlelight as the merchant turned to listen . " I am sorry for the blow I dealt you , " Robert said . " I was angry for Henry 's sake . " He held out his hand impulsively . Hesitantly , Wat took it . Then abruptly bent and kissed it . Robert pulled his hand away , surprised . Wat said hoarsely , " I have beaten Murdach often , but when I call he comes , ears flat , tail tight and all apology . I have no tail , and my ears stand out , but if you call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " It 's a useless knave , " he said , " brawling and wenching when there 's work to be done . But take him if you will , or he 'll kill Paul for jealousy . Now , who 's to tell Paul he 'll not go ? " Wat 's face was savage . " Your Worship , " he said , " I told Paul hours since and put a hole in his head in the telling , to be sure the words went in . " They sat in the great hall near the kitchen , and Wat fetched two cups made of half-coconuts bound with silver . The merchant gestured from his chair to slanting shafts of moonlight beyond the glow of their candles . " Once I filled that hall with my children , " he said . " Amulph was the eldest , and I think on him when I look at you . You favor him , though Arnulph 's hair was black and yours is pale . His build was more stout , as I think on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide . I Iis eyes were dark . Nay , you are not alike at all . I do not understand it , but every time you pass I see my Arnulph . Yet he was never gay like you , but a serious lad worried for all England . " " I am worried enough for England , " Robert said . " Wherefore ? " " I had a dream , a dream of ill portent . I saw King Henry betrayed . " " By whom ? " " A cloaked man , holding out his hand for gold . I saw his fist close on it . " " So you searched my attic for him ! You 're forthright . That 's the Saxon blood . But the dreaming , that 's Welsh . They 're a queer , dark , 63  | brooding people . They see in the night and talk with spirits . I knew a Welshman well . A ship of mine sailed , and he said he saw her breaking up on rocks in wild surf . " " Did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came again to any port . " The merchant stared hard at Robert . " Some people scorn dreams , but I am not so foolish . I 'll ask about , cautiously . I 'll listen if I can hear of any plots against the king . Whatever crows in Southampton must hatch in London first . Ah , God , if but one of my sons were alive ! " He sighed . " I had ten to begin ; eight boys , two girls . Arnulph was the eldest . Well , babies die , it 's the will of God and not to be gainsaid , but I was luckier than most and seven lived . Five boys , two girls . Fine children , obedient , except for Constance who was ever a spitfire and small besides , the last of all the litter . " He sighed again . " I see now the gentle ones took after my wife , God rest her well , but as for Constance , that acorn fell under the oak tree . ' What I would , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would . My wife was helpless with her , and I away too much . I said at last she must go to the nuns at St. Anne 's . " He tossed down wine against his painful memories . " The last time , I was two months on a journey . When I returned , I rode through the Aldgate unchallenged , not a man on guard . Here 's slackness , I bethought me , I 'll set aright . Then I saw there were none abroad in the streets , and this full daylight . " He crossed himself , and the candles flickered with the motion . " Next came a cart rumbling down the street with a little bell sounding , piled with dead thrown in like wood . I thought I had the nightmare . In this nightmare I spoke to the driver . Is the city taken ? I asked . He said , Yes , of the angel of death . The plague is upon us , and more die than can be buried . " I galloped home . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no one in this house or garden or stables . All vanished . I ran across the way and pounded at their door and it opened of itself . They were all dead within . I ran down the street , shouting and beating at doors , begging that they tell me where my wife was , my wife and all my children . At length a man looked down from an  | upper room and said , Dead and carried to Pardon Churchyard , buried with a hundred others in a common grave . I stood out in the street and wept . I think I meant to kill myself . My hand was on my dagger . Then I remembered . I had one child who was not in the house when the plague passed through . " It was well no man sought to stop me . I galloped all the way . I smote the gate of St. Anne 's convent , and frightened the poor nuns inside . I swore if no one answered , I 'd burn all down , for if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon send the smoke of a convent to Him and serve the Devil the rest of my days ! " I know not what I did in my wrath , but one nun , God give her blessing , said I fetched straw from a field and piled it against the gate to begin my burning , until she came and spoke to me gently and opened , and praise to St. Anne , my daughter was left me . I built them new kitchens and gave them land and gold . To this day , they may ask of me what they will and I give it . " The merchant held out his cup and Wat stepped from a shadow and filled it . " So it may be that you understand what this child means to me . She is spoiled , I acknowledge it . But what man can forbear to give his only child her way in all she desires ? Now she desires you , and this I can not grant . You know us for Lollards , others suspect it . I am surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die hard . I ask no quarter in this , but I must provide for my daughter when I am not here to protect her . Nay ! I know you 'd do what you could , but you have not dealt with enemies like mine , who lurk aside and use whispers for weapons . You have no friends in high places , the only bulwark against them . Therefore , she must marry the old man . I have thought much on it . She must ! He 's wily and his family 's powerful , and once they 're wed he must defend her or fall himself . Yet it is a pity , for she has a marvelous fond heart . " Ile gestured at Wat to refill Robert 's cup . " She brought this knave into the house , the winter after the plague . The snow was deep , the wind bitter . They died in the streets . One clay there was a whimpering at our courtyard gate . Constance cried out that someone starved there , and would give me no peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ragged and beaten , with blood loam on him and streaked down our gate where he fell . He would 65  | not tell us whence he came , or could not , for he had been much struck about the head and was a little foolish . I would have turned him away , for he had a dangerous crazed eye , and though he was starved , the muscles stood out on his arms . He was a dirty , bloody animal and maddened , but Constance seized him , and I could not drag her back without him . " The merchant turned his head slightly as Wat moved away . " Therefore , " he said , " he will do anything for her , but as for me , he remembers I did not want him . " Wat did not move in his shadow , and the merchant sighed and set down his cup . " When must you be in Southampton ? " " The fifth day after St. Peter and St. Paul . " " You can reach Southampton in five days ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay one more day with us . St. Peter and St. Paul is a great holiday in London , and Constance has made such plans . Let her have this celebration . She 'll be married and sober soon enough . She had Arnulph 's clothes from the press yesterday before you woke , to choose a garment for you to wear for holiday array . The maids have worked in secret to shorten the cote-hardie to the fashion that you favor . It 's fine dress , Robin , brown velvet trimmed with sable , embroidered in gold with oak leaves . My wife did the orphrey work . Arnulph swore he would not wear it else , the garment was too plain . I remember my wife sitting there by the fire and the gold thread flashing while Arnulph leaned on her chair , overseeing every stitch . " " How can I take what was your son 's ? " " Because I wish it for my daughter 's sake . She is yet alive , and the boy 's long dead . Will you stay another day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , for a premonition of illchance was on him . But he dismissed it . They had been kind to him here , and he had grown fond of them all . " I 'll stay till tomorrow , " he said .  | Chapter 9 THERE were huge bonfires in every square , each circled by singing and dancing maids and men . London blazed , kissed strangers , picked pockets and went mad . Every door was garnished with green birch and long fennel , and flowers , and lighted by lamps of glass with oil burning in them . Up and down the lighted streets more lights went marching with the marching watch , while noise crashed all around : singing , bellowing , shouting , neighing , barking . Armor clanked , trumpeters trumpeted , and drummers and fifers banged and squealed . The mayor marched , and his footmen and henchmen and torchmen . The sheriff marched , and the guilds of the City marched too . Archers marched , pushing back the mobs with their ranks , dressed in coats of white fustian with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bows bent in their hands . Pikemen marched in glittering corselets ; and morris ( lancers bounced at the tail of every procession . It was worse than a battle . Robert had to spur his horse against a wall of screaming humans swaying in one mass in the streets . Wat shouted , " The French can be no worse than this ! " and laid about him with a whip to clear more space for his horse . Bearded sailors off JesrL rode behind Wat and Robert with Constance and her aunt between them , and last came Walter and John and Paul , waving torches that spewed sparks on the heads of everyone . They reached their destination after a bitter struggle to the alley at the back of the Pope 's Head Tavern . Here in this favorite ambush of thieves the crowd shied off for a brighter path while they jumped in with a rush and clattered down the long dark way to a mean court at the back . They left their horses there , with a boy who swore he 'd stay by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who thinks to steal my Kingat Arms , " Constance said . " He 's all in a passion from the crowds . They get rougher every year . " 67  | The smell of roasting flesh reached to them as they entered , and a blast of heat from the kitchen . One of the sailors inquired if the ale was good . This was a tavern above a poor man 's purse , he said apologetically , and so he did not know . " You 'll find soon enough how it is , " Robert said . " And His Worship bid me tell you this . He will pay for all ! " There was a delightful , shocked pause for a moment , as they realized what Robert said . Then the men all shouted alike and stampeded for the front to seize room at a table by the empty fireplace , while the landlord himself escorted Robert and the women to the place he had saved for them . " This is not choice , " Constance declared , with a scowl that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like it very well , " Robert said . It had a handy exit and was near the horses . She shrugged and sat down without argument and looked around at the noisy crowd , while a sweating serving wench fought her way through to them , laying about lustily with a wet towel to beat down hands that reached for her , until at length she stood by Robert . Dame Margaret wanted beer and so did Constance . Robert thought of all the wine he 'd already drunk this day and ordered more , to avoid a sickness in his middle . It seemed to him as if all the merchants in London had put tables of dainties at their door , serving out food and drink all afternoon . Since the Worshipful Alderman was known all over London , they had been able to pass scarcely a single house without a horsebridle seized and demands made that they drink up or forfeit forever the regards of the master there . Constance was mannerly and whatever was offered went down at the homes of her father 's friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickled fruits , lampreys , pasties , honey cakes , figs , and God alone knew what some things were she devoured . Now she looked about restlessly with bright , excited eyes . Robert watched her , warned by her father that she might flirt when she was joyous with the spirit of the holiday . Ah , my lady had decided where to throw her glances . On the opposite side of the room was a dais , guarded by a carved rail , a place  | of honor . Here under the low roof with his head raised by the dais into wood smoke hanging among the ceiling beams was a lord and his henchmen at a long table that groaned under food . This lord faced Robert . He was grossly fat , red-faced , and sweating so hard his bright green houppelande was marked with it . A jeweled collar was about his neck , and his hands glittered when they moved . His henchmen shouted from one end of the table to the other , but the lord himself was quiet , with his lip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Who is he ? " he asked my lady . " The fat one in green . " " Him ! That 's Edward , Duke of York , four times pardoned for trying to murder King Henry . " York ! Picture him younger , thinner , and in Wales . Picture him an old enemy , the first that Robert had made . He recognized him now . " ... four times that he was caught , " Constance amended . " God knows how many other plots he spun and blamed on others . Yet the king pardons him each time . " " Henry is a gentle king , " Dame Margaret pronounced . " Let the fat duke beware , " Constance said . " He 's not loved in London . " " Nor was he loved in Wales , " Robert said . " You know him , then ? " " It was long ago , " Robert said . " I was a child when he came to the castle , at Christmas . " " And ? " Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gaunt stone castle . A huge ox roasting in the great hall , for the kitchens were overwhelmed . The children gathered before it , staring , except for Robert , who stood by the countess . Another woman stood by . " The duke is coming through the gate with his retinue , my lady , " she had said . " Which duke ? " the countess asked . " Edward of York , my lady , who is cousin to the king . " For then Henry the Fourth was ruling on his usurped throne , and this King Henry was the Prince of Wales . " Which king ? " the countess asked , to be scornful , for many thought 69  | poor King Richard was not dead but hiding and might come back for his stolen throne . Robert asked if this was the Duke Edward who fought so well . " His courage is good , " the countess said . " It 's his character that 's bad . " Edward of York passed Christmas with them . He was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a short man turning gross , his face marked by disappointments . He was an ambitious , intelligent man always crossed by his own treachery and with no hope of posterity , for he could not get sons . It was said he could be amusing when he chose , but at their castle he chose only to drink himself sodden . It was also said the sight of Count Llewellyn 's six sons had soured the royal duke 's temper , when he could not manage even one . It was certain that he acted like a wounded boar . At New Year , according to the custom , the children drew water from a new well and went among the feasting company , dipping dried rosemary sprigs in the water and sprinkling the guests for good luck and all blessings in the New Year , while they piped out high-voiced songs . It happened that Robert reached to sprinkle the Duke of York . The cold drops hit the duke 's hot face and startled and angered him both , for he flung back his chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were some kitchen knave . " Have it back ! " Robert exclaimed and flung his vessel of water . The duke seized a knife . " If you strike me , " Robert said , " I 'll kill you for it when I 'm grown ! " The count had meanwhile come running , grabbed Robert and thrust him back . " Now there 's a spirited boy , " he said , " and if he 's displeased you , I 'll punish him , but none of it was meant for harm . " " Another of your sons ? " the duke had asked . " That one , no , " the count said . " Now , Your Grace , I 've a new horse that you 'd like . The ground is hard , true , but there 's a wolf in a thicket near the castle . Let 's hunt and leave the castle to women ! " He 'd laughed and clapped the duke on the back and jostled him until he was talked into hunting as drunk as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert . But the count turned as he supported York from the hall , and nodded . He 'd approved .  | The countess said , as the men swayed out , " Rob , you were right . I give you good counsel . Always be bold . Break before you bend . It becomes you . " After that York ignored Robert , whether by reason of forgetting or for fear of his host 's anger , no one knew  --  but Count Llewellyn had invited guests and held them for ransom before , and now he showed favor to Robert . When he hunted , he took Robert . And as soon as the boy was fourteen , he had him as his squire , following into battle . He had been all for his thick-bodied sons and found he could not trust them . The youngest were stupid , and the two eldest craved his lands and title . He turned to Robert and from that moment , Robert had to plot for his life ; for Rhys and Gryffyd were greedy lest they lose one penny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all their avarice and grasping at power , they could not come nigh this Duke of York . Four attempts on his liege lord 's life , and four times forgiven . He was aware again of Constance , smiling prettily at a young man in white and gold , whispering to the Duke behind his hand . " And that one ? " Robert said . " God knows , " Constance said . She leaned closer . " Pick a quarrel with him , Robin . " " Why ? " " That I may see you fight . A little , little quarrel will do . " She measured with her thumb and forefinger how small it might be and please her still . " Leave off , " Robert said . She grinned like a street urchin . " Welshman , your temper rises . Look how the oak leaves flutter as the storm begins ! " She poked at the embroidered oak leaves , rising and falling as he breathed . He could have kissed her , the pretty bit of impudence , but instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York remembered him , for they said the duke was vindictive and always paid old scores . But remember York , with Constance by him ? She was dressed in fine array , her hair in two braids and each thrust into a cylindrical gold mesh caul on either side of her face before her ears , with the open ends up and down . The mesh of the cauls was set with jewels at each crossing of the strands , and a gold fillet bound them , crossing her forehead low . She wore a mesh net , jeweled also , over  | her back hair , and over that a tiny transparent veil that had been stiff at the beginning but now had gone limp . Her gown was scarlet sendal , cut too low , but her father did not object to this , it seemed , as long as her arms were decently covered . " He has a crooked nose , " Constance said , " and his eyes are set too close . They say only natural sons have eyes so close . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'll not provoke a fight for your amusement , " he told her . She moved away from him , affronted , and brushed her forearm fretfully across her forehead . " Landlord ! " she called . " Landlord ! Open a window , or I 'll roast ! " " Let it be , " Robert advised her . " He needs the shutters closed to keep noise in and the watch out . This is well past legal hours and he 's chancing it . " But she was not to be denied her open shutter , for the slim knight in white and gold had risen and slithered around duke , henchmen , chairs and all , with sword hilt catching and clattering as he came . He flung open the shutters on a window to the back court while the host watched , appalled . The dandy bowed to Constance . She inclined her head . The dandy returned to his seat . York had missed nothing . His eyes watched from their folds of fat . " Robert ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her eyes , which added to his turmoil . He tried to ignore her and watch the duke , but her perfume was warm and surrounded him . " There ! " she exclaimed , triumphant . " You 're sweating ! I told you the room was too hot ! " The Duke of York said something to the dandy , who nodded and kicked back his chair and stood . The room went tense . Well , it had come , and it pleased Robert well enough . A fight took energy and he had much to spare now . He pushed CQnstance aside and stood also . The last man ceased talking in the middle of a sentence . By the fireplace , Wat 's shouting crew was silent , and Walter got up and slipped out the back . Robert flicked a look of approval to Wat , who 'd thought of having the horses ready to run . The white-and-gold dandy pledged his cup to Constance and drank , an open insult . " Mistress , " Robert said , " it 's time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she said . " Not I ! I 'll not miss this too . " " You will not be here , " he said , " when the battle starts , nor when the watch comes to allay it . " He caught her by the wrist . Wat jumped to his feet , alert . Constance jerked back against Robert 's hold and began a tug of war . Then the white-and-gold man was beside them . " The lady does not like you , " he said haughtily . " Get to your drinking , " Robert told him , loud in the silent room . " That is your business , and none of this . " " I 'll escort the lady home , " the dandy said . Robert said , " Dame Margaret ! " Dame Margaret roused herself with a shake . " Fighting ? " she inquired , startled . " I will not go , " Constance said and flung herself on her stool . " The lady is pleased to stay , " the dandy said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Robert replied . The dandy drew his sword with a sibilant hiss of steel . And Robert drew his . The folly bells jingled as he shoved a stool aside with a kick . Benches scraped and trestles banged as they were flung into corners and out of the way . The two opponents circled warily . " Lords ! Sirs ! Lordings ! " the landlord wailed . " Not in my tavern , as you are gentlemen ! Your Grace ! " He turned appealing to the duke . " Ah , lords ! " Robert yelled " Lancaster ! " The duke 's man shouted " York ! " And Robert lunged to press the fight . The dandy fended him off , and his face showed he knew already he was overmatched . Robert rushed him backwards . A man shouted , " Ten nobles on the one in brown ! Who 'll back the man in white ? " Shouts began all around , and in the midst of it , abruptly , Robert struck home . A stain sprang out on the dandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloody froth seething at his lips . " A moil " he moaned , and blood ran over his chin and he fell . Three of his companions overleaped the rail . " Shame , " yelled someone . Wat bawled in anger . A sailor yelled " Boarders ! " And the fight turned into a riot , with everyone engaged . The landlord  | lunged about , snatching torches from brackets and flinging them into the fireplace to darken the room . Planks crashed . Everything movable was flung . Then came an ominous drumming ; fists raining blows on a door . " The watch ! " the landlord bawled , despairing , and wrung his hands in a corner . The battle hesitated . Robert slashed his opponent hastily on the sword arm , leaped back and seized Constance down from the table where she 'd stood , swinging a stool at any who ventured near . He flung her shrieking out the back window to Walter and leaped out too . Wat shoved Dame Margaret next , and the sailors covered retreat as long as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert gave King-at-Arms a crack to send him headlong , and galloped wildly after . The watch pursued them screaming Stop ! Stop in the king 's name ! But by then they were in Lombard Street , inextricably mixed with merrymakers , while the watch tried to halt other brawlers spewing from every window and door . And so they got safely away . There were sore eyes and swollen lips and tender noses among them . A sailor had been knifed in the leg and swore all the way to the jouncing of his horse that gave him hurt . Robert discovered his linen paltock sleeve was dark with blood , but it was not his sword arm so it did not matter . The sounds of strife behind them lessened . They walked their horses as soon as they dared , to call less attention to themselves and their disheveled state . Bonfires still flared in many places , but only the younger celebrants were now abroad , and the tables with good things had long since been taken back into the houses . Garlands lay underfoot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sky showed where some slum was burning down . Wat said , with deep satisfaction , " That was a good riot . " " And well for us if we were not known , " said Paul , who always thought on the dark side . " York would be a bitter enemy . " " The watch got him , " Wat reported with glee . " I saw it . A man-atarms at each elbow , dragging the fat duke away . " He chuckled . " Think on it . Twelve knights tossed in one dungeon , gold spurs and all . And a duke ! God be my witness , a genuine duke , in a genuine London jail ! " He guffawed . " You 're drunk , " Paul said .  | " With joy ! " Wat admitted . " I 'd tell my children of this night , if I only knew their names ! " " It 's well for you you 're leaving London , " Paul said with morose envy .

" It was only that I never saw you fight , " she said sadly . " I never meant all London to join in ! " He smiled , despite himself . He had fought well , killed his man , and no shame to him , and was it not after all natural for a maid to want to know what a man was made of ? " Think on what to tell your father , " he advised her sternly . " My father is abed by now , thanks be to St. Anne . " The sorry procession halted at the garden gate . Wat flung himself down , and cursed as he felt some obscure hurt . Then he straightened again and opened the gate with an iron key . Murdach whined welcome from his iron ring . Wat hushed him . The horses moved in quietly . Wat barred the gate and they moved toward the stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing torch by the lintel stood the merchant , with his arms crossed under his beard . The two sailors flung their reins to Paul and hastened off to Jesu at the quay . The stableboys rushed the horses into the stables at a trot . Robert and Constance and Dame Margaret were left to face the merchant . Somewhere down the street a swinging sign complained of rising breeze . Wat came cautiously out of the stable to loose Murdach from his ring . " Wat ! " The knave stopped abruptly . " Was it a good fight ? " the merchant inquired . Wat turned with a grin . " Mother of God ! " he exclaimed with a lilt . " What a bloodletting , and with the Duke of York , that traitor ! The watch leaped on like terriers , but we got clean away ! " The merchant smiled . Dame Margaret said , " He 'll stand there the night , fighting it over , but as for me , I want my bed . " 75  | Whereupon she marched away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to go to her master . They went slowly down the three steps to the kitchen . The hearth fire burned still , and a kettle bubbled and steamed there . Constance took his arm to halt him where they were alone , and he winced . " Ah , " she said , " I had forgot your wound , and you were hurt but for my vanity . " " I 'll cherish the scar , " he told her . " Let me wash it , " she said . " It will heal swiftly of itself . " " Your wound , perhaps , but never mine . I have known you only days , yet there 's not time enough in the rest of my life to heal me from this party . See out the window . Light streaking the sky . Oh , God , already ? The night 's gone . " " And here 's Blaunchette , " Robert said . " Your father wo n't be far behind . " " The folly bells rang out the day we met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would not stay . Following your lady to France . Go then , Robert Heartless . They named you well . I do not care how soon you leave ! " She stepped back disdainfully , then suddenly burst out weeping . He longed to tell her of the countess , that there was no true love he pursued , but only war and loot in France that he might wear the gold spurs of a knight . But wherefore ? She must marry another ; let her do it thinking his heart was far away . The merchant came in then . The two men looked at each other with compassion for her . " Here now , tears are in vain , " her father said to comfort her . " You 'll learn to love the old man . He 's kind and will be doting . " She let out a howl , and fled . " Well , I 'm sorry for her grief , " the merchant said , " but I look to preserve her life . " Dame Margaret came bustling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl 's fit for Bedlam the way she 's weeping . " " Sleep by her . Comfort her , " the merchant said . Dame Margaret said , " I loved when I was young . My father married me to another , and it was a good marriage , but I never forgot the first . His name was Robert , too , and he was gentry . He was killed in  | the lists at Smithfield , the day I turned sixteen . " Abruptly she turned away . " Come over to the fire , " the merchant said to Robert . " I 'll wash that wound before it festers . Here , I 'll help you with the cote-hardie . " The merchant unfastened his points and peeled off the paltock and threw that bloody-sleeved garment in a corner . Then he took hot water from the kettle steaming over the fire and sloshed some in a basin , wrung out a cloth , and touched it to the wound . " The gash is clean , and not too deep . Here 's some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's good for wounds as well . " IIe smeared some on and Robert set his jaw against the sting . " This brings back my own youth , " the merchant said . " Patching up after a brawl . " " I am sorry for it , and that Constance was involved . " " Think not of it , " the merchant advised . " I 'll send to the landlord for the bill and the damage , and add something for his memory to fail . A little high play on a feast night is only to be expected . I was no calm man myself . Lift the arm . I 'll bind it . When do you think on leaving ? " " Now , " Robert said . " It 's not daylight . The road is dangerous . " " It would be more dangerous for your house if I stayed . The Duke of York remembers me , I think , from another time . I 'll go before he finds me here . " " I do not care who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's waking the men and saddling horses .

Therefore , let it be now . " " Holy St. Anne , " the merchant burst out . " I could weep with Constance . " But he woke a kitchen boy and sent him to bring down Robert 's belongings . Blaunchette came over from where she had lain watching and put her muzzle on Robert 's knee , her eyes turned sorrowfully upward . " She never did that for any but myself , " the merchant said . " All the household dotes on you . " 77  | " I have been happy here , " Robert said . " And yet you go . Before God ! I had thought honest men were fools before this time ! " But he helped Robert dress , for the arm was stiffening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his folly bells . " The house will be silent now , " the merchant said . Robert jerked a single small bell free and put it on the table . " That 's for remembrance , " he told him . The door from the courtyard opened , and they turned to the sound . Wat Strongbow stood there . " The horses are ready , " he said . Chapter io THE MERCHANT looked out the side windows at the rose bushes in the narrow garden . They had bloomed all June but were leaves and thorns in late July . His daughter came in then , having just returned . " What did you do with yourself this morning ? " he inquired . " I went to mass with Allys at St. Olave 's , " she said . " And then ? " " To mass at St. Paul 's . " " And then ? " " To mass at St. Mary-le-Bow . " " Afterwards ? " She gestured . Home . " I got some news at least , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He left for Southampton yesterday . " " What of it ? " the merchant asked . " A brawl in a tavern is nothing to revenge , and besides , he provoked it : " " York spent most of a month in a dungeon . " " He 's spent years of his life in dungeons , " the merchant said . " A little more wo n't swell the tally . " " But honor 's involved . He sent a man to King Henry , praying for release , and King Henry sent back word he would not intervene , that the king 's justice is above all , even the king . "  | " York should have had more sense than to bother King Hal with a trifle . " " A trifle ? If the army was not delayed , it would have sailed without him weeks ago . " " Robin 's lost among thirty thousand , stuffed into Southampton , " her father said . " He 'll not come out deliberately to tease the duke .

Well , in another century perhaps lovers might meet and marry , but not in this , nay , not in this . He sighed , and thought how to tell her he 'd made arrangements for her marriage . " This morning . . . " he began . She looked at him , sad-eyed . " What of this morning ? " she asked . He could not tell her now . " It 's a fair morning , " he said lamely . " I 'm glad Wat 's by him , " she said . " Wat would cut a duke 's throat as fast as any man 's . " She picked up her goblet and she tinkled . There was Robin 's gold bell around her neck on a chain . It was not the day to tell her , but it was well that all was done and the marriage contract seen to while the girl and Allys rattled around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat back , father and bridegroom , and the lawyers argued obscurities , and a word out here and a word in there , signatures , seals , and copies to each party . John Taylor was almost sixty , but eager . He was in fair health , had an excellent disposition , and was at an age where a young girl was a wondrous thing . Constance would have her way with him , no doubt of that at all . It was strange to see her so quiet . At length she said , " It were a shame for the moths to devour all Arnulph 's fine things . " He guessed at what she wanted . " Is there such a hurry ? Robin 's not worn out his own . But take them , take . . . two garments . Remember , they must go on the back of a horse . " She did not finish her food , but called her maids , and puddled the floor with color as she spread the things out there . Silk and velvet and wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle to choose . It was painful to see them so . That tawny made for a wedding . And 79  | there . . . that violet and azure silk , in diamonds , that he never thought to see again , made for Arnulph 's own wedding and never worn at all . As he looked at it Constance bent to pick it up , and held it for him to see . " It will become him , " was all he said . " Do you like it as well as the scarlet ? " " Equally , " he said . The problems of lovers and their partings . He was grateful for Mistress Anne in her neat cottage on the edge of his hunting preserve , a reasonable ride from London . He could visit if he chose , or not if he chose . Anne was a woman grown , the daughter of his gamekeeper , and his companion since he was eighteen and home from sea with his first prize in tow . She was assiduous to his comfort , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was left a widower . He felt suddenly maudlin about it . He 'd ride out today . He 'd bring a gift . It had been a long time since he 'd taken care to choose a present . Yes , he 'd visit today and let business rest . Anne had a fund of tasty gossip got of her father at the local tavern , all the latest scandal . It might be he 'd hear of the Duke of York . Of late he enjoyed this talk more and more . A quiet sitting by the fire in the winter , or under a tree in the fall . Well , he 'd had a hot youth and all things cooled . He watched his daughter and Mary standing together , heads bent over scarlet velvet , thinking how the stitches must be ripped . Then he heaved up to his feet . " I 'll ride out to see how the deer do on my preserve , " he said . " I 'll be late for supper . " " I 'll wait to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be late , " he warned her again . " I 'll wait till you come , " she said . He nodded and departed . He bought a topaz ring and a bolt of yellow silk . He stopped once more to get a cask of pickled lampreys , and tie it on behind his saddle . Then , encumbered with all this , and whistling one of Robin 's tunes , he rode gaily out of London . To come back at a gallop on a lathered horse , with no gifts , no songs , and no smile , but a grim look . He strode into the great hall , and Constance started up from her sewing .  | " There 's nothing ready , " she said . " I have no time for eating , " he said . " Where 's Paul ? " " Gone to Norwich . " " I know he 's gone to Norwich . Is he back ? " She shook her head . " I ca n't trust the others , " he said . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd travel the black streets this night . " My lord father , " Constance said , " what can Paul do that I can not ? " " Fight in London 's alleys , " he said . " Plots ! Plots ! " He contained himself with an effort so his voice would not inform the house . " London 's like France tonight . Where two men whisper together , murder 's planned . " He broke off and started for the door . " I only came for Paul and a fresh horse . " She ran after him and caught his arm . " Let me know the danger , at least , " she said . " I 'll help in any way I can . " He looked down at her , a little thing . But if he could not trust her , he could not trust himself . " Anne had grave news from her father , " he said . " When I rode in , she was preparing to ride to me , though I had bid her never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confession ? " " Months ago , " she said . " Does it displease you ? " " I would it were years ! " he said . " It was a week ago they seized him . No . . . no , do n't turn faint . . . not Robin , but your confessor . The priest 's already convicted of Lollardy . Stay away from St. Olave 's , it 's brimming with spies . Suspicion is on all nigh him , and he was your confessor . Still , it 's been months , they may forget you . They can not try all London , and a spy can only spy so far . " " Can our lawyer help him ? " " It 's hopeless , " the merchant said . " Besides , we have many priests in London and one can easily be spared , while I have a single child and can not spare her . " " He was a good man and kind to me , " she said . " Let me visit him , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you these were grave matters . He 's hung and stiff on his rope . " Her mouth opened , but no sound came .  | A shuffle of feet . " Well ? " the merchant roared . A boy from the stable spoke in a frightened voice . " The black horse is saddled , Your Worship . " The merchant dismissed him impatiently . " Must you go tonight ? " Constance asked . " I must . There are Lollards gathering , and uprising planned . I will not sleep till I learn the plot . " " Have they kept it from you ? " she asked , surprised . He nodded grimly . " They know I 've done king 's business and helped spin plots in France . They fear I 'll try to warn him . I will ! Ay , I will . If I can learn what they 'll do ! " " Thank God , Robin 's gone , " she said fervently . " We 'll not touch him with our danger . If the king is murdered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father finished . " Stay in the house . Do not open doors . If we must run , there 's Jesu at the quay . " She hastened beside him into the courtyard and stood by as he mounted . Blaunchette waited , eager for adventure , a vicious fighter for all her loveliness . " Obey me , Constance , " he said , down from his horse . " I care for nothing but you , and would not leave you now if it were not to preserve King Hal for England . " And again at the gate , as she unbolted it . " Be mindful of what I say , " he warned her . " Bolt the gate , turn Murdach loose , stay within the house , and do not open doors ! " She waited in the great hall before the fire , listening to the storm thundering outside and trying to stay her trembling . She perceived now in her fear that high courage in some people was merely a doing before a thinking . If she had thought , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone . She was an impulsive coward who acted , and then wept . She shook with terror now for what she 'd done . Oh , but her father would be raging if any told him she had left the house . But she 'd done it openly , as if there was nothing to hide , surely they would not think to mention this to him . And if Paul , returning from Norwich , had accepted her action as normal  --  at least in the beginning  --  why should any others think it strange ? If they did not tell her father , then she would not tell him either , for all her fear and wish  | to unburden her conscience . Pray God Paul kept his babbling mouth shut ! Should she have paid him ? That was a mistake . She saw it now . By paying him to be quiet , she had admitted she was uneasy . She moved even closer to the fire , and could not warm herself . She was frightened for what she 'd done , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arguing it all over and over until dawn . Only then did the merchant come home . She leaped to her feet and ran to him , to clasp as much of his bulk as she could . He pushed her back . " I 'm wet , " he said . " I 'm dripping . " " Your Worship , " she said , half sobbing , " you 're safe . I care for nothing else . " " Now , now , " he said , embarrassed at showing tenderness . She bethought herself of his business . " Did you discover anything ? " she asked . " Murder , " he said . " Is Paul back yet ? " " Do not send him on your business , " she begged . " I can not write the message that must go to Southampton , and I can not go myself , " he said . " I must stay in London to quell the uprising that will surely follow the spilling of royal blood . " " The less Paul knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Send me . " He looked at her piercingly . " Ay , " he said without argument , as if both had known from the start it must be she . " King-at-Arms can reach Southampton in three days , " she said , " no matter how bad the roads . " He nodded , mouth set . " I 'll give you sailors from Jesu for escort , " he said , and strode out through the kitchen , while she ran to wake her aunt . She was on her way by sunrise with her party . She dared not think too long . From horseback , she looked behind and saw the steeps and spires and roofs of London above the disreputable walls . The beacon was still alight on St. Mary-le-Bow . July the twenty-fifth . She must be in Southampton by the twenty-eighth and there were seventy miles or more to go on dangerous roads , with many delays , ahead . She turned her face to the west , and rode as if she had been her father 's son . 83 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stayed at an inn beyond the walls . He hated the walled port . It was a stifling , stinking place jammed with soldiers , sailors , pages , pickpockets , harlots , and scornful lords thrusting scornful horses through the press . The army had been delayed too long . The beer grew daily weaker and the wenches more rapacious . The army had spent its pay while waiting and now slept in the streets , and robbed when it could . Gossip said August the first was departure time , but there were other rumors , untraceable to any source , that said they would never go at all , so that Robert remembered vividly his dream of a betrayal . The Duke of York was here now , strengthening the feeling of danger near the king . He had arrived the day before , on July the twentyseventh . Four times York had been forgiven . Was he risking a fifth attempt ? There had been much to excite suspicion . Little groups of nobles in crowded streets , whispering with sober faces . Little parties gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone knew there was an evil gathering , but what it was and where it came from was obscure . Robert could do little ; but he knew the merchant was powerful in London and had sworn to listen for a plot . Therefore , Robert haunted the chief road from London , to intercept any messenger who might be sent . The shadows of a hot afternoon were across the road . Another day futilely gone , it seemed , until Robert saw a cloud of dust that turned to a yellow mist enveloping a party riding hard . Robert said , squinting , " There 's a gray horse in the forefront . " Wat watched . " King-at-Arms , " he said . " He always goes with his head very high . There 's Dame Margaret on the chestnut . The others ride like sailors . Jesu must be in from Calais . " They spurred forward to meet the others , and the parties met , joined , and milled in the road . King-at-Arms swung aside to a green meadow , and Robert cantered after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and bushes alike . Robert felt the hair of his neck rise up when he saw her face . " Your father ? " he inquired instantly . " Well , " she said . " All the household is well , but London 's sick . The Lollards are gathering to rise . Oldcastle 's in rebellion . " " Rebellion ? " He showed his disbelief . " Sir John 's no rebel . He 's convicted by the Church of Lollardy , but never by the king of treason . Besides , he 's in Wales on the run . " " He 's near London , like a falcon above her prey , " Constance insisted . " He 's in rebellion now . He 's turned on the king at last . " " The fool ! The king will crush him ! " " The king will be dead , " she said , " and his three brothers . " " Holy Mary ! " Robert said , and crossed himself . " How ? When ? " " They 're to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent London from sending aid to Henry 's party after his death . In the end , we 'll be blamed for it all . " " York 's in it , " Robert declared . " For once he 's clean , " she said . " His name has never been mentioned . " " He grows cleverer as he grows fatter , " Robert said . " He lets others take credit and blame alike , and counts his gains alone . " " It may be , " she said , and Robert knew how grave things were when she refused contention . " Who 's in it ? " he asked . " Thomas Grey of Heton , " she said . " I 've seen him , hanging about in the streets with others . " " And one the Earl of Cambridge ? " " Ay , York 's brother . " " York is not in this , " she insisted . " I do not like him and will not defend him , but they say be 's not in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the plot , more dangerous even than York . Do you know who is thickest with Cambridge ? " " No , " Robert said . " Never him . Not Lord Scrope . Name the Archangel , but not Henry 's truest friend . " " Henry , Lord Scrope , " she said , and named him . " But the two Henrys are always together , " Robert protested . " Lord Scrope is privy to the king 's thoughts . I 've seen them riding and laugh-85  | ing on this very road . They were boys together . Scrope 's the last friend of his childhood , since Oldcastle ran for his life . " " If you will not believe it , how will the king ? " she asked , despairing . " It 's a man 's life to warn him , and he 'll not be believed . I know not what to do . My father will try to quell trouble in London and show that we Lollards are cat's-paws , Scrope 's tools , to be destroyed when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? " Robert asked . " French gold , " she said . " A million crowns of it , they say . A better price than ever Judas took for the body of our Lord . " He had dreamed it . The fist had closed on golden crowns , and the money had dripped down endlessly . " How much time is left us ? " " Little enough , " she said . " No sooner was my father privy to the plot than he set me galloping . King-at-Arms knows how we have ridden . They will rise tomorrow . " " Tomorrow ! " " And set the Earl of March on the throne as the rightful heir of Richard . " " As to that , " Robert said grimly , " he may be rightful , but Henry is the king , anointed and crowned , no matter how his father seized the throne . The Earl of March is a gentle prince , no man for high place . He 'd be ruled by Scrope . " " Exactly so , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , who would be king instead , though he must stand behind a throne . Lord Scrope , who 's made a pretty plot and provided a scapegoat besides . He 'll send Lollards to the stake for murders that he 'll do . " " The king 's in Portchester , fifteen miles away , " Robert said . " Tell His Worship I have ridden to warn him . Wat ! " Wat rode over instantly . " Will you ride with me this night ? " " To hell and back . " " Perhaps not back . " Wat grinned . " Then I 'll shoot at devils and imps tomorrow , which is well . I 'm tired of deer for targets . " " I go with you , " Constance said . " Nay , you 'll return to London with the news . " " I have pigeons and a code to send , " she said . " I 'll ride with you . "  | " Your beast is tired , " Robert said . " He 'll delay us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead in the road . He 's of purest Eastern blood and stoutest English heart .

I tell you I will come if I must follow like a dog , scenting your footsteps with my nose . " " There 's no gainsaying my lady when she 's determined , " Wat advised . So Robert turned his horse to the Portchester road . My lady shouted to her escort that they were to wait at the inn with John and Walter , and then , with King-at-Arms running high-headed and pulling as gallantly at his bit as if he were fresh from the stable , they went off with my lady between them . Stray soldiers wandered along their way and looked hard at a woman riding , but no one stopped them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon climbed into a starry sky and flooded the earth . When the outline of Portchester Castle showed square against the moon-drenched sky , they halted . " They 'll never grant us entry , " Constance said . " They 'll bid us wait till morning . " " The king might still be abroad , " Robert said . " It will be well to watch the road , for he must come by here to the gate . If he does not come all night , then he 's inside and must ride out tomorrow . " " Scrope 's in Southampton yet , " Wat said . " I saw him there this morning bound for a day 's hunting , though what a man hunts in July , God knows . " " A king , " Robert said . " We 'll lie in wait . I saw a place at the bend , before the castle comes in sight .

" I 've had only glimpses from a distance . " " He sits very proud on a horse , " Wat contributed . " And rides a favorite white courser most often , " Constance added . " Then may he ride that white courser tonight , so we may know 87  | him , nor stop strangers who 'll give battle for nothing and cause us to miss the king . " " I 'll know the horse , " Constance said . " As for the king  --  when you are close , look for a deep-cleft chin and a scar by the left eye , that he had of a wound at Shrewsbury . It almost killed him , but never taught him caution . Robin , be careful . " " I 've stopped men from ambush before , " Robert said . The moon sailed on , and the shadow of the trees slanted across the road . Twice Wat went cautiously to look over the crest of a small rise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underbrush , breathing hard . " Two riders , " he reported . " One on a white horse ! " " You stop the second rider , " Robert said , " and I will halt the first . " " Jesu , " Constance exclaimed , " I love a bold man , but this frightens me . I 'll hold your folly bells , and shield , and here 's my veil to cover your face . No , over the hair also , or it will gleam . " Wat covered his nose and jaw with a kerchief and pushed his leather brain cap lower over his eyes . The sound of hoofbeats were audible now , the thudding of tired horses . " They 're topping the rise , " Constance reported . " I know the horse ! The man on the right is the king ! " Robert drew Henry 's sword and arranged his long sleeve over the hilt , so it might not be remembered . He looked at the riders , to judge his distance . Oh , God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Duke of York ! Well , a man must take chances . He leaned a little forward , ready , and felt his horse gathering beneath him . He looked over to Wat . The riders came closer . And closer . And were almost opposite . Chapter 12 KING HENRY strode up and down the narrow cell impatiently . There had been so much delay ! Not even the coolness within the thick walls of the Abbey of the White Canons at Titchfield could  | lower the heat of his anger . Would to God Harry Scrope was here ! There was much to be discussed , and it seemed no other man could get things done ! He thought fretfully of his last interview with the French ambassadors about the possible marriage . That plucked owl , that Catherine of France , that madman 's daughter ! His mobile face darkened . That damned French archbishop , standing before him , accusing him of never wanting the girl at all but only delay to prepare for war , saying he had no right to the French crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were told they should treat with the heirs of Richard instead of a usurper 's son . And I lost my temper , he thought , despairing . He 'd been goaded to it , but he was rueful now . He 'd shouted that the lot of them should get back to France , and he 'd follow soon enough . Soon ? The delays he never counted on . Scrope was one man and could not be in two places at once . The friends of his youth , how he missed them ! Dozens of companions and no worries or fears when they were by him . But now , whispers of a plot again . Henry sighed wearily , and paced more slowly . There were always whispers , and each one must be traced . Well , Scrope could find if there was aught to the latest , he 'd probably heard of it by now . , .. as long as they did not use poison . He 'd a horror of that now . They 'd used it for the first attempt when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman giving him sweets , beguiling him with laughter . He 'd been a thin and dark-faced child , harshly treated by a father who thought to prepare him for a throne . The woman had been pretty . But he remembered mostly the burning . And the retching that followed . It was the retching that had saved him , but he 'd been terrified of a beating for dirtying the floor . He had never relished food since . Always before he put it in his mouth he thought , Suppose it 's poisoned ? And the affliction in his throat bothered him yet . Fifteen years . They had not killed him , but they 'd made him remember the attempt . Suddenly , he could not stay another night within these walls . IIe must ride on . The old restlessness seized him ; wild energy that would not let him stop . He had a need , a drive , a necessity to hurry on . Always to bitter unfulfillment . He was twenty-seven years old and 89  | felt his life would be short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a wailing he could not assuage . Let me live out my destiny ! A crushing sense of doom swept over him . Make haste ! Time passes ! A minute 's gone ! Another ! It was his private agony of desperation . He dared not sleep a full night , struggling to add more time to his small supply . Scrope was the only one who knew of it . At least , he 'd heard the words when Henry told it . King Henry did not think even Scrope understood this tearing , but at least he did not think it strange when they 'd seem to settle at one place for the night , then suddenly depart for another . Scrope merely saddled a horse and rode with him . He looked out the narrow window of the cell , attracted by sounds of laughing , and saw some of his men under a tree on a bench with winecups in their hands . Despoilers ! he thought . Suckers of gold ! Not even honest leeches , healing a man . IIe looked beyond them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portchester that often carried travelers from Southampton past . There were some riders on the road , though it was twilight . He could see three together , the middle seemed a woman on a gray horse . They 'd better get in for the night , he thought , and turned impatiently from the window to pace again . It was too late to set out now . He 'd have to spend the night . Why had his father wanted to be king ? For this sorry knowledge of a murderer always lurking , so that he , Henry , who 'd been a brave soldier , always wanted a wall at his back , always faced doors and never turned to leave a man behind him ? The old king had regretted his throne at the end , he thought . Old king ? Forty-six , but riddled with disease , his face so disgusting with discharging pustules that he only ventured out after dark . I 'll die in Jerusalem , the old king always said , repeating the prophecy which foretold it . He had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . But he 'd been seized with a fit at the shrine of St. Edward Confessor at Westminster . He 'd been borne through the cloisters to the Abbot 's lodgings , and laid on a pallet before a roaring fire in a room . And when Henry came galloping and asked where his father was , they 'd said , why , in Jerusalem , for so the chamber was called . His father died there , in Jerusalem . He 'd not cheated the prophets by delaying his crusade . They 'd had their way .  | A short reign and a turbulent ; as the snow came and passed away . Henry the Fifth had his prophet too . He 'd waited there between his father 's pallet and the iron Lancastrian crown of England , brought in great haste to the dying king so it could not be stolen by a man with a better claim . At length the king 's breathing seemed to cease . The doctors bent over him . Henry rose and looked down on the ravaged face . Then a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and picked up the iron crown . The fight to hold it was begun . He knew not what he felt . Then a movement startled him . A doctor exclaimed . He turned . At the pallet a thin hand like a skeleton 's thrust up blindly , and blindly tugged at the silk . The old king was yet alive ! His face peered up . The eyes looked around . To his son . His eldest son and prince , holding his iron crown . " What right have you to that , " he asked in a whisper , " seeing I had none ? " So Henry held a murderer 's crown in his hands , there in Jerusalem . It belonged by right to the Earl of March . But March would make no ruler , and England was sore beset . Nay , a Lancaster had taken the crown from a weak king , let a Lancaster hold it from another weakling . March could not deal with rebellion at home , with a divided Church and an England ridden with heresy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a middle class rising to power . March could not restore England 's prestige . It would take a Lancaster . They had many faults , but not one of them was weakness . Henry 's hands clenched in Titchfield as they had clenched hard on the crown in London , two years before . His problems were still with him but thank God for Scrope . Scrope stood by . The last friend left of them all . The first was Hotspur . Dead twelve years . When the Percy family rebelled , there was little plotting . They rebelled with armies and banners for all to see . Hotspur had marched to rid himself of a tyrant , the tyrant King Henry IV had become . Forthwith he marched on Shrewsbury and bottled up the Prince of Wales . He rode up to the walls and demanded admittance , and Henry had stood on the walls and refused . Two friends , forced by politics into opposing camps . Then King Henry IV came to Shrewsbury , for it was his battle , after all . Hotspur withdrew to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no weakness in the Lancasters . On the evening of July zest his men tramped through fields yellow with uncut corn , for harvest time was near . But the harvest was dead men . Henry remembered himself being wounded early in the fight ; an arrow he never saw , stuck suddenly into his face and the blood dripping off his chin ; but he 'd pulled out the arrow and fought on . He 'd fought till the fight was won , and someone called him and pointed , and he stumbled over and it was Hotspur lying there , burly even in death ; but strange to see him quiet . Hotspur had been given to laughter and shouting , to riot and song and dance . What was active was Hotspur . And Hotspur was dead . He was weak from his wound , bleeding still and growing dizzier ; a sixteen-year-old with all hazy and growing hazier . He knew he would faint , but while he could he clutched at his father 's arm and begged that Hotspur might have burial . The old king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had rather seen his father dead and Hotspur living . " Have him ! " he 'd said to his son . " Bury him ! You 'll bury all your friends before you die ! " The promise had been given . Henry was sure of it , though he had been sickening so fast from loss of blood . But the promise had been given . After that , he fainted . Much later , when he fought out from the delirium , he found the promise had been broken while he lay helpless to plead for his friend . By the king 's order the body of Hotspur was dug up , rubbed with salt , and placed sitting by a pillory , guarded by armed sentries , so all in Shrewsbury might see Hotspur Percy was dead , and no man dare say he 'd escaped to the mountains , and later counterfeits appear , as the king was plagued with duplicates of murdered King Richard . After that they cut off Hotspur 's head and sent it to be fixed on the gates of York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hung in London and Bristol , Chester and Newcastle , so all would know throughout the realm that gallant Hotspur was truly dead . It was politics for the old king , but Hotspur had been Henry 's friend since he was thirteen and sent to govern turbulent Wales . He could not bear these walls about him ! He 'd ride on to Portchester and meet Scrope there tomorrow . He walked to the window . He did not like darkness , but if he stayed here now , too many men would rise up from their graves and torment him .  | Those other riders he had glimpsed on the road had been pressing on . Was he better than his subjects ? He 'd ride also , but also not alone . Edward , he thought . He 's a traitor , but at least he does not fear me . And they were related by blood . He called his Duke of York " cousin , " though in truth York was cousin to the old king . So it was the Duke of York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotspur . Henry crossed himself suddenly as he thought again of Hotspur , aware that York looked sideways covertly . Henry knew what they all said : he should have gone to the Church , he was too pious , he prayed too much . But then , he had so many to pray for . All his friends were dead or rebels . Except for Scrope ! Thank God for Scrope ! " Your prayers are finished , Hal ? " York inquired as they rode . He wanted to talk . Henry did not . York waited , then amended his presumption . " Sire , " he said , in one of his flashing fluctuations from equality to humility , " I know that white horse is your favorite , but I beg you to return and change him . He shows too well in the dark . " " I said nay to the others before I left Titchfield , and I say nay to you now . " " But he shies at every shadow , " York insisted . IIe did not want to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his mind . This plot , this faint whiff of treason that had come to the sharp noses of his spies  --  they had tried to scent it to the source and failed . There was a clever rogue behind it . Some said it was the Lollards . He should have listened to Scrope . They 'll murder you yet , Hal , Scrope had said , if you do not destroy them . We need some burnings to discomfit them . Or raise them in rebellion , he 'd replied , and tossed off Scrope 's advice . It could not be there were so many . True , the Church was splintered , and three popes quarreling . The matter must be set right , before the splinters turned to cracks and then to chasms . When he had time enough . . Time . God grant me time . I 'll raise England to a power . I 'll unite the Holy Church . I 'll seize back the Holy Land from the infidel . If You but give me time . 93  | York said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A pause . " The landlord has a handsome daughter . " " I 'll ride on , " Henry said curtly . This angered him , this waving of wenches in his face as a cure for his darker moods . ' This made his plight more sore . The curse of his life was the desire of his body , and when he took the crown he 'd made confession of this and vowed and promised he would govern both England and himself . It must be both or neither . If not himself , then he could not govern England . If he learned to control desire , he could learn to control himself , his temper , and this rebellious country , all three . Yet it was hard for him . He was full-blooded . Not cool like his brother Tom , who was twenty-six , married to an older woman , contented with her and faithful besides to prove it . It was easy for Tom . But as for himself , he boiled and seethed and could scarce breathe for the troubling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas would have made the better king . Or even John , the third of the four brothers . But never Humphrey , the youngest . Henry 's face set . Humphrey is like me , he admitted to himself , or what I will be if I do not control these moods and wild distempers . Yes , Tom would have made the better king , better than any man so driven by rage and lust and loneliness and wild ambition . But he 'd chained the lusting . God knew he had . Two years and over . A man can learn contentment with continence , he insisted to himself . If he must . Edward again , interrupting his thoughts with chatter . What had he said ? A dangerous night with the moon showing all ? " It 's a fair night , " he replied . " A fair night for thieves . The moonlight almost blinds me . " " Stay on the left hand , " Henry said distinctly , as York sought to drop back and go around . " My horse bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might displease you , or make your beast sheer off . " " I can hold a horse straight , " Henry said . " Your pardon , sire , " Edward said . When they had started , York had made to ride by the sword arm . Was it old habit to ride on the right , or new plot to block the swing of his sword ? York was a sharp man and intelligent , despite a fat man 's  | lethargic look . And bold , besides . York had never been a coward . He was quick to chance an opportunity ; he 'd been quick to come on this ride . Too quick ? Here 's a matter to think on ! York was devious . Like the matter of the book on hunting , a fair good book , written by York while imprisoned for treason and attempted royal murder , and dedicated to the king who 'd sent him prisonward and given the leisure to write it . That were a deft matter . Deft and merry and impudent , too . York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If he protests , then he 's laid no ambush , and there f ore it is safest to go on . If I stop , there will be assassins at any inn York favors . " I will ride to Portchester , " he said . The path was clear then . An honest robber was not to be feared . I-le was glad there was only York with him . One man can be watched , a few would outnumber him . It was a good trip and a swift one ; and as they approached a little crest in the road , Henry knew it was probably a safe one , for from the last rise of ground he glimpsed the square tower of the castle . But suspicion was in him yet . York had ceased his dire predictions , and seemed content . Was it because they had reached journey 's end ? Or was it because he had lured his liege lord on with protests ? York was clever enough for this . It could be , just over the hill , armed men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were stout yeomen there . If there was to be murder , it would be lying between the top of the hill and the next clear sight of the castle . It would be waiting close enough to the castle for a traveler to feel safe ; but too far from the castle to call help . It would be as God would have it . From the top of the hill , as the path began to dip , the road seemed clear . Moonlight lay ahead of them like snow . Insects sang . Henry always listened for them ; little heralds , warning if any stranger stole by to still their song . He rode on amid the cheerful sounds of tiny lives in the underbrush that went back into tall deep shadows and trees . Where an army could hide . The castle was out of sight now . He looked swift from side to side of the road . Between here and the castle , if it was to be tonight . God , God . If I had a man by me I could trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this stallion 95  | shied at anything and would fling him to the ground for the huzz of an arrow . Keep on at this pace then , unsuspecting as it seemed , and hope that all was nervousness at darkness , nothing more . But he 'd campaigned long in Wales , among Welshmen born to rebellion and suckled on ambush , and he knew . This was the place for a trap . He was afraid of it . But he 'd not let York see he turned craven so close to the castle . He kept his head high and his body straight , and listened for the instant 's warning he would have , the place where the insects did not sing . Chapter 13 ROBERT spurred abruptly , and the startled horse shot out of the underbrush with a violent rush . The bay horse on the road reared with terror . The white horse neighed and shied violently away . The king was flung sideways , almost from the saddle , struggled to draw his sword while still off-balance , pulled it free ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sovereign , " he cried through the muffling scarf , " I come not to waylay but to warn . " " Edward ! " the king shouted . But York was down in the road , with Wat on horseback standing over him , bow drawn to his ear . The king turned back . " Then give me this warning that needs an ambush to be brought . " " You are betrayed , sire , " Robert said . " You are to be murdered on the morrow , and your brothers also . Thw plot and the moon are to the full at once . " " How did you find this plot ? " the king asked scornfully . " From a true friend , as I am yours . " " Does a true friend mask his face ? " " If he is a Lollard , sire , then he must . " Nothing less than the absolute , dangerous truth could convince this king .  | " Well then , Lollard , " the king said , " who 's in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friends . " " I have few and will have fewer . Name them ! " " Thomas Grey of Heton . " The king waited still-faced for the next . " The Earl of Cambridge . " King Henry looked back over his shoulder . " Edward , " he called , your brother has been named a traitor . " York did not reply , but stood in the road . " Henry , Lord Scrope , " Robert said . The king 's hand clenched on his saddlebow . But he waited . " The Earl of March is in the plot , but not of it . They 've frightened him to silence . Scrope plans to rule England in his name , and execute Lollards for the plot . " " And York ? What of York ? Will you give his name ? " " I have not heard it . " " Where does London stand ? " " The Lollards there are loyal . They will not rise . " " That 's a mighty promise . Who are you to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " " Prove it , " the king challenged . Robert dismounted on the instant , picked up the king 's sword from the dust , and proffered it to Henry . The king seized it , seemed as if he would strike ; then sheathed it quickly . " Let me guard you to the castle , sire , " Robert said . " Nay , I 'll ride on with Edward . You say he 's not in this plot ? Still , if I die tonight , or tomorrow , I charge you , kill my Duke of York . " " Sire , I will , " Robert said . He mounted his horse and pulled back from where it blocked the way . " My thanks is this , " the king said , " that I did not unmask you when I had the chance . " And he spurred away with his duke . Robert sheathed his sword thoughtfully and pulled the veil away from his face . Wat came to him , and the horses stood side by side . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wat commented . " Not a purse or a jewel tossed us for our trouble . And we 'll be troubled , I think . York watched you very close . " Robert shrugged . " There 's nothing he can prove , no matter what 97  | he may suspect . Here 's my lady ! " he said quickly , to warn Wat to silence . Constance came crashing out . " That were bravely done , " she exulted . " You stood to him bold as the lion on your shield . " " My lion is sleeping , " he said , as he took it and hung it by his saddle , " and I was no bolder than he . It was as well I sat a horse . My knees were jelly so close to the king . " " Liar , " she accused him . " You rode up bold as a lion , discoursed like a scholar ? " " You never heard a word . " " Brought him his sword like a courtier , and stood like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if he 'd struck ? " " I 'd have killed him ! " He turned his horse toward Southampton . " You think not ? " she demanded hotly . " I 'd have ridden to him all tears and sworn I was stolen away , and the first time he turned his back , the Earl of March would have had his throne . I do not carry a dagger to cut bread . Robin . . . it might have been better if you were unmasked . The king was much impressed . " " Greatly , " Wat said , with irony . " Greatly ! " She caught the mockery . " Robin , did York know you ? " " I do n't think so , " he said . " But the king knows him , " Wat said . " Not by name , " Robin said quickly , " only that I 'm a Lollard . There was no other way to explain my manner of seeking him . " " God , if York remembers you by name . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , give it to me . Praise be to St. Anne , it does not bear my father 's mark . " Whereupon she flung the fine , expensive thing into some bushes , a prize for a scavenging villager . " Robin , I brought with me some clothes that belonged to my brother . We could not bear to waste them in the press . Bury that cote-hardie . Your horses go back to London with me , where they 'll vanish out of England . I 'll give you two of ours . And Robin , give me your Bible , also . " " No , " he said . " Let me sleep nights , " she begged . " Give me the Bible . "  | " If it 's a noose for a head , let the head be mine . " " My father can guard it for you . " " It goes with me . I have sworn to Heaven I will carry it . " They were at the crest of the hill , and here he swung his horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the road , but far off there were torches flickering and racing over the battlements of the castle , to congregate at one place . King Henry had reached his gates . Tonight he was safe . Tomorrow lay with him . Robin turned his horse again and trotted down the hill with the others . After a while my lady said , " My father knows the Duke of Burgundy well . " " The one who took gold to betray his own king ? " " All men take gold , or some other thing , " she said , being a practical merchant 's daughter . " Burgundy is a gallant Frenchman , and he likes bold fellows . He 'd like you . Robin , would you join him in France ? " " And sit the war out in Burgundy ? Nay , I 'll go to France , but only . . . " " To that woman ? " she inquired , with jealousy . " To King Henry 's battle , " he said . They rode on in silence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king 's man , " she said , " and will follow him , but Robin , do not forget how thankless that king was tonight . " Chapter 14 SOMEWHERE out in the graying dawn , King Henry thought , as he leaned on the cold stone of the parapet , York silent beside him , was the Welshman who had warned him . A Welshman . The accent had been thick . There was no doubt of his origin . And it was a neat trap too . Trust a Welshman for that . " Loyalty , " he murmured , " in an unexpected place . A man who 'd warn me at his own risk . " 99  | " Loyalty , sire ? " York asked . " Say he had good reason of his own , rather . A Lollard would plot Scrope 's downfall in any way . " " You defend a plot to murder me , Edward ? " " Nay , sire , nay , " York exclaimed hastily . " I did but mean ? " " Your brother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll not forget . " " Let me send after this man , " York urged . " A little torture ? " " He said you were not in the plot , and if he changed his tale , you 'd die . You 've betrayed me too often , cousin . I tire of it . " " I swear before God , I have been loyal since you took the crown ! " " Swearing comes too easy to you , " Henry said . " Therefore learn truth , which is often halt and stubborn . Guard ! No one is to leave this castle today without an order signed by me ! " He turned back to the duke . " Dear Edward , " he said , " I 'll not have you send warnings swift after my orders for a council . " The guards looked covertly at York . One ventured a malicious grin to the other . Edward was safe for the day now , Henry thought , and he must think of other business . A letter must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lollards , he 'd say , dictating tentatively in his head . But do not act against them unless they rise . There was softness his advisers would not like . But he 'd say to them , um , he 'd say , It is not a time for pursuing Lollards . He must have peace in England if he would war in France . Scrope would say that any time was a good one to pursue . . . . He flung the name suddenly from his thoughts , as if it had been a stinging nettle . Scrope ! Scrope ! He almost cried out the name . He 'd pulled tight within , as if a hand jerked at his guts . It could be gross calumny . Send a guard after the Welshman and drag him back . Torture out the last vestige of his knowledge ! Nay . The man had warned him . He could not return evil for good . Suddenly he turned and ran down the stone steps , so abruptly he left York behind , openmouthed . The guards glanced significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One lifted a shoulder slightly . Their eyes followed King Henry as he went hotfoot across the yard below . " The chapel ? " one hazarded to the other . The second nodded . " To pray the morning through . He 'll he a saint , I think . " too  | " I 'd rather be a man , " the first one said , " but we 'll both be only heads on halberds if we do n't watch that traitor there . " They resumed their pacing so that one of them always faced the Duke of York . Henry had thought to laugh and joke with Scrope this day , take time for gossip . Instead he sat sweating in July heat in Portchester Castle , on an oak chair for a throne , with all the nobles come from Southampton to sit in council . They stirred , mopped faces , looked worried . Scrope turned continually toward him , and Henry as carefully looked away . He had prayed half the morning that Scrope was maligned . He had risen from his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Then he had gone to his chamber to read the reports that had been waiting for two days . The plot still swirled in obscurity , his spies wrote ; but it was more than a scent now ; it was a stench . Cambridge had been seeing the Northumberland knight Sir Thomas Grey , a cousin of Hotspur , secretly . Henry bargained with heaven as he sifted through more reports . Let not one name appear among the others . I 'll sacrifice Hotspur 's cousin and York 's brother . Let me not find .. . On Sunday , the 22nd July , read this report , Thomas Grey of Heton arryved att Southampton and entered into comunycation with Lorde Scrape . Bothe then did communycate withe thee Earle of March . Grey and Cambridge , both with Scrope , and all with the Earl of March . Henry was ill with this betrayal , but his reasoning was clear . All in secret communication . Let it be done openly and he 'd grant coincidence in meeting . But secretly  --  that 's intrigue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that now did him for a throne . When this council ended , would it be firm beneath him ? He looked over the assemblage of his lords . They feared him now . Silence , heavy as the heat , thick as the humid air . All the faces turning blurry . The iron crown bore down hard on his head . " I have heard rumors , " he began . " Of a plot . " He stared straight at Lord Scrope , who paled . Guilty , Henry thought , and passed sentence . " Look among yourselves , my lords , " he invited . ioi  | Heads turned cautiously to inspect neighbors with uneasiness . Scrape did not move . You , who were my friend for all my life . " Thomas Grey of Heton , " Henry called . " Let me look at you . " After a hesitation , a man rose defiantly . He was in his early thirties . Hotspur 's cousin . But there was no resemblance . It would be easier , therefore . " Richard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The earl rose unwillingly , glancing wildly toward York . They bore great resemblance . Two traitors in one family . As well York had no sons . That were too many snakes for one bosom . " Henry , Lord Scrope , " he said , forcing out these words . Scrope stood immediately , and straight . " How say you , my lords ? " This heat , this heavy crown ; his heart burst with grief . " Guilty , sire , " said Hotspur 's cousin , bold as the rest of his clan ; admirable friends , honest enemies . " Cambridge ? No words ? I 'll speak for you then , " Henry said . " Guilty . " Guilty indeed if he did not now protest his innocence . What proof there must be for the seeking . Yet one more traitor remained . He looked full at Scrope . " Guilty , sire , " Scrope said . Henry held himself tight-reined . He 'd been betrayed before . " Sheriff , " he said , " take these three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Southampton . " A shuffling of feet as the sheriff 's men herded them . " Is there anything you 'd say ? " Henry asked . Thomas Grey curled a lip . Cambridge sent more imploring looks to York for intercession . Only Scrope made answer . " I would ask mercy , sire , " he said , " for the sake of our long friendship . " It stung Henry like a whip , a goad , a spur . This man would provoke murder , and then be excused for friendship 's sake ? " Mercy ? " he inquired of him . " You ask too much , Harry . You presume . What is broken can not be used . Would you ride a lame nag , wield a broken dagger , take a wanton to wife ? Go to , Harry , do not  | ask good service of cracked friendship . I 'll give you justice as I am king , but I 'll not give you more ! " The three men were marched out . Henry rose . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out quickly . The crown was a torment on his head . He reached his chamber , dismissed the pack of gentlemen running after him , slammed his own door , flung the crown from him to the bed and stood with clenched hands . It was a moment before he noticed his little spaniel at his feet , trying to climb up to his arms . He picked her up and held his cheek to her silky neck . " Welshman , Welshman , " he muttered to her long ear . " It were better to have taken my life than my friend . " On Friday , August 2nd , the Duke of York brought Henry the news at Portchester that the commission of twelve lords , sitting in the castle at Southampton , had examined the three accused men . No torture had been used , as Henry had sternly forbidden it . Yet the proceedings were short . Cambridge and Grey had admitted their guilt again and threw themselves on the king 's mercy . " Scrope ? " Henry asked eagerly . York hesitated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " He says that he was privy to the plot , but not to carry it through . he wished only to learn it and tell you . " " A strange song he never sang to me . Tell him this plea is illadvised , since I would have been dead before he denounced them . Besides , the Earl of March had sung that song , though I believe him . He 's timid and afraid of Scrope . How did the verdict go ? " " Guilty , sire , all three . March 's name . . . was not mentioned . " " It will not be , " Henry said . " I will give him pardon . " York licked his lips . " You hesitate too much , " Henry told him . " Sire , my brother and Lord Scrope . . . " He gulped again , by which Henry knew York had fought against this but given in to his brother 's wish at last . " . . . claim trial by their peers as their right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of that , and pulled Cambridge after him . He thinks on delay and delay and delay again , until my temper cools and I forgive him . What a puny thing my temper 103  | is if it cools so quickly and I think , well , he tried to murder me , but we had a happy youth together . It would take months , and he has not that much time . Scrope thinks on days when it was long work to gather up peers scattered over England . Now all the dukes and earls and barons in my peerage wander the streets of Southampton , waiting to go to war . I 'll bring them together in a day , and give Lord Scrope his trial ! " " Sire ? " York whispered . " Oh , begone . " York waited a moment , then backed away and closed the door . Henry watched for him by a window , to see him come out below . He was weary , weary with praying through a long night . He warred within to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said he was weather-tempered ; stormy or sunny by turns and only God knew how the weather did ; a man could only bask when it was fair and run for shelter when it thundered . York appeared below , and they brought his horse to him . Henry had a sudden feeling that York was sincere in this effort to help his brother . But he frowned at his own fancy . As well send a child to sleep with a hungry lion as let trust nestle with York . He turned from the window to send two messages : one to the sheriff at Southampton to assemble a jury within a week ; the second to his brother Thomas of Clarence , to preside . By nightfall , the Duke of Clarence came walking in , frowning over a paper in his hand . " Twenty nobles summoned for the jury , " Thomas said , " and here 's the Earl of March , eager to serve . Does the guilty try himself , Hal ? March is high in this plot . They promised him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Behead him , " Tom urged . " You 'll never have a better chance . Behead him while you have good proof of treason . End a claim to your throne ! " " He meant no harm , " Henry said . " It 's his misfortune to be heir to a third son , while I am heir to a fourth . He wants no crown . " " Others want it for him . " " I know you give good counsel , " Henry said , " but I will give good pardon . " " That 's a fool 's trick , " Tom said . " He 'll trouble you again . "  | " Then he will trouble me again , " Henry said , flaring up , " but I will not execute an innocent man . " " Innocent ? " Tom said . " He 'd have seen you killed . If you think on sparing Scrope too , you 'd better speak now . Left to myself , I 'll see him beheaded . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calling you his friend . " Henry scowled . Tom shrugged and walked out , untouched by executions or blood . They were right , the ones who said Tom should have had the crown . He had the stomach for it and slept well of nights . All living was a chess game to him , and death but a piece off the board that could not be played . They looked much the same , the two oldest brothers ; only a year apart in age . But there the likeness ended . Henry had all respect for his brother , but he had never loved Tom ; and Tom had never loved him . King Henry came to Southampton on August 5th , when the jury sat in Southampton Castle , but he kept aside in a distant chamber while Thomas , Duke of Clarence , acting and speaking in the king 's name , pronounced the sentence . Death to all three ; but the infamy of hanging was to be omitted , and Grey and Cambridge were to be spared the ignominy of being drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention of Scrope in these orders . And so , very soon , Lord Scrope would be hauled through the streets from the Watergate to the Barred Gate in a hurdle pulled by a bony nag ; like any common cutpurse . The crowds surged in the streets , waiting for the fun . They 'd fling many a clod at the bound man . Scrope was not liked . He 'd squeezed too hard ; taken too much from too many . The stones would be flying ; and the catcalls would follow him to his death as the mob shoved , bloodthirsty , jostling the cart to the place of execution outside Southampton 's walls . Henry heard a step and swung round to the noise . Then he smiled wanly as he saw Bishop Courtenay , who had free passage to his presence . " Were they shriven ? " he asked . The bishop nodded . Now came the sounds of Scrope 's progress through the streets ; sounds that made Henry wince. 1o5  | " I shall pardon March , " he said . " Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the merciful , " Bishop Courtenay said . They walked to the window . The crowds had already vanished and their howling was diminished by increasing distance . " The proclamation was already written , " Henry said , " to be published after my murder . They styled me Henry of Lancaster , Usurper of England . " Here 's a birthday gift above all , Henry thought bitterly . Three days hence he 'd be twenty-eight ; and have little joy of it with three men new-buried as proof he 'd live to reach it . " I 'll change my will before I sail , " Henry said . He had named Scrope in the old one . The bishop only nodded . Where was the Welshman now who 'd brought the warning ? Beyond the walls , standing by to see the executions , pleased as they bandaged Thomas Grey 's eyes even now ? Was he grinning as Grey knelt on bare ground ; avid as the executioner gripped Grey 's hair with one hand and swung the sword high with the other ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the might of the executioner , who was undoubtedly well bribed by Grey 's good friends for the last service they could do their lost companion , which was to see that the first cut be the last and save him an agony of hacking until he was finally dead . You 'll not go free , Welshman , he promised him , as his anger waxed with his agony . I can find you . Tall , well formed , moving with grace . Face and hair both covered . Was he redheaded then ? A Welsh accent and he handled his sword like a Frenchman . The horse had a white foot . Nay , forget the horse , he 'd be rid of it by now . Welsh , with French training . Tall . Hair of a diverse color . And a strangeness about that sword . He 'd kept his sleeve upon the hilt . It had , therefore , an uncommon device . Something more about the sword teased Henry .. . Bishop Courtenay put his hand on the king 's shoulder and Henry started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a touch . Courtenay thought him a good man because he 'd given Lancaster 's huge revenues to Holy Church ; but that was only a flourish with a pen , while he 'd let a heretic soul escape on the Portchester Road . He felt a deep sense of guilt . He began to pace , breaking free from  | Courtenay 's soothing hand . Scrope dying , and the Lollard gone scot free ? Beware me for a friend , I make a safer enemy . Suddenly , a roll of drums that transfixed him where he stood . The drums stopped . And Thomas Grey of Heton was dead . They were dragging the body aside , flinging the dripping head into a basket and handing it up to a man on horseback , to post north with speed . The head would be fixed on a pike and displayed at Newcastle . Henry resumed his restless pacing . It was endless , endless , waiting for the next . A roll of drums . York had begged for him , begged for his brother 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his smooth tongue , and tears in the little pig 's eyes . The drummer stopped , and the Earl of Cambridge would never trouble him again . Henry braced himself for the last roll of drums , bending his head and praying for the soul of his last friend from youth . I gave you death , not for the plotting , for others have plotted and lived , but because you were my friend and betrayed me . The drums rolled suddenly . There was a tearing agony in him . " Harry ! " he said , aloud . " Harry ! " Then all was still . Scrope 's head was galloping to York , to be fixed on the Micklegate Bar , where Hotspur 's head had been set so long ago . Bishop Courtenay said softly , " Sire , I beg of you the bodies of Thomas Grey and Cambridge , that they may be given burial . " Henry nodded curtly . He was unable to speak . The bishop had not mentioned Scrope . He was afraid to ask for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry begged silently . Command me ! But the bishop bowed his head , and made to leave . On the threshold he paused and looked back . Ask Scrope 's body of me , Henry thought wildly . " Sire , " the bishop said , " I am not so sick that I can not go to France with you . " Henry shook his head , deeply touched by any kindness , and found his voice . " The doctors have forbidden it , " he said . " I shall go nonetheless , sire , " Courtenay said , and vanished . A true priest , a good man , a confessor to whom not all was told . 107  | The bishop would go to France and toss away his life to fill the place of a man just dead . Yet it was to Scrope the traitor that Henry had opened his heart and mind and soul , from whom he had withheld no secret ; it was to Scrope he had confessed what he never told any priest , and given him wealth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for dogs and ravens , and no man would touch it without Henry 's consent . While Henry could not bear to speak his name . Now came York , subdued . " Sire , " he said , " the bishop told me of your mercy . " The duke came closer . Henry moved away . The duke halted . " Sire , " he said , with his voice hardening , " I think I saw your Welshman of the Portchester road . " " Watching the execution ? " " At St. Julian 's chapel , where I was . " " Doing what ? " York hesitated . " I think he was praying , " he admitted at last . Henry drew in a deep slow breath . He had not watched the death . He had prayed for them instead . Welshman , you 've preserved your own life a little longer , though York will have it yet , and revenge his brother . " Sire , shall I trip him up for you ? " " No , " Henry said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think ? " " I want proof . Can you show me such as is there ? " he asked , gesturing to the table with the copy of the proclamation of March 's ascension to the throne . " Nay , sire , not yet . But if I bring you proof ? " " Then bring it , but do not trifle with guesses . And get out ! " York backed hurriedly . Was that fear ? Fear ? In York ? What expression is on my face that York backs so quickly away ? He was at the door . " Edward ! See that carrion Scrope is buried , " Henry ordered harshly . " Sire , I will , " York said . " And send my captains to me . I 'll not stay another day in this port ! " " Sire , I will . " The guard in the corridor closed the door . And Henry was left alone , to think of Scrope.  | Chapter 15 OUT ON the dark water , small lights moved mysteriously , tossing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transports or more with their torches and flares , following twin lanterns hung on the admiral 's vessel . A very congregation of lights around and above six thousand men-at-arms and twenty thousand archers . Robert watched the glitterings from the rail of Dover , and listened to the sounds of the sea : the gurgling of water , the creak of wood ? and the snores of sleeping archers on the deck behind him , rolling back and forth like lifeless bodies as the vessel dipped and rose . It had been different when they started ; that had been for such as looked to adventure : the craft dipping and bowing and finding their places in a din of trumpets and drums , the flutter of sails and the crack of spars , a wild gaiety of banners amid the crash of shields lashed along the rails of every ship , with the king 's Trinity Royal magnificent with a passion painted on her sails and a crowned leopard , gilded all over , on her prow . They had started on Sunday afternoon , August i i , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind fair for France . Now they were ending their voyage , and all was reduced to little lights and the watery sounds of the sea . He crossed himself suddenly as he shivered and he knew , with a knowledge he could not form into words , that it was the vibrant prick of something-soon-to-happen . Another disaster ? They 'd had one as they started . Three ships had burned to the water in a tangle of spars and fire and drowning men , billowing smoke to the heavens , while their neighbors dashed hastily away . But then , the swans they 'd seen passing the Isle of Wight negated the first evil omen . Suddenly Robert stiffened . He thought he saw . . . The captain passed then , stumbling over sleeping men . " Lean out a little further , squire , " the captain said , " and I 'll be short a man of my tally when we anchor . " Robert said , " Out there . That flicker there . " He gestured past the 109  | torches to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in darkness . " Could it be France ? " " You 've seaman 's eyes , " the captain said . " I could wish them for my lookout . That 's the beacon on a castilian tower . Kidcause , the Frenchmen call that spit of land . " " I see white , " Robert said , while prickles rose on his skin . " There 's a chalk cliff there . " " And a harbor ? " " The mouth of the Seine . " " Then we 're for Harfleur , as was rumored ? " " You , not I , God be praised , " the captain said . From above came a shout , as the man at the masthead cried the beacon fire at last . The captain shook his head and moved off down the pitching deck , muttering to himself about the men who called themselves sailors these days . A little later , Robert smelled France , for the breeze was warm offshore . Then all day long he watched as they drew nearer . Toward nightfall they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their cables as smaller ships cut across them . Now men shouted from ship to ship , discovering friends . But when night came , they quieted , for they began to think more of home than of fighting here . Wat came to stand by Robert , who had been studying the shore and piecing together what he could of France . A beach covered with large , sharp stones  --  good weapons for slinging and plenty to hand for a moment 's stooping . Ditches dug all over the beach , with the tide flowing through . A horse could not be charged through that . It would be hand-to-hand fighting afoot then , over shifting shale and ditches , and after that , the earthworks that stood out in bold outline against the sky , higher than a man 's head , with bastions atop like the wall of a castle , and only a few narrow passages cut at long intervals . Holy St. David , the beach could be held forever ! Then without forethought , Robert began in his mind to hold the beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defensive action , that was the role they played in Wales . Offensive action hardly counted , they were always badly outnumbered . Occasionally he 'd harry a force of English , without hope of victory but  | with great determination to be a nuisance , killing a sentry here and stealing a few horses there . Wat said suddenly , " The rumor they 're shouting is that a thousand men will go ashore in the morning to test the temper of the French . " He spat overboard with scorn . " They 'll not live to reach the bastions . " Robert resumed defending the beach against a thousand men ; then suddenly caught himself up . He 'd been planning his own death . He had grace enough to grin in the dark . He found he was unlashing his shield from the rail . It smelled faintly of paint that refused to dry in the damp . He thought of the news he 'd sailed on . His father was dead , had been dead a week or more . He thought again of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounds and pains from old wars . Wat had got green paint from somewhere and obliterated the red chief and gold molets . Now his arms were those of the senior member of his house . His house , forsooth ! There was but him ! " . . . Fairfield ? " " Here , " Wat called . " So you did not fall overboard ? " the captain inquired of Robert . " It 's as well . I 'm to put you over the side in the morning , before dawn . A man came under my bow with those orders . You 're going ashore . " " With the thousand ? " Robert asked . " Before the thousand , " the captain said . " Twenty men are to test the temper of the French . . . or so they say . . . before any others are risked . " " Who ordered it ? " Robert asked . " The messenger came from the admiral 's ship , where the council was . He called you Robert Heartless , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Robert 's face in the dim torchlight . Then he shrugged and walked away . " York , " Wat guessed . It was likely . Robert looked at the dark , unlighted shore . Twenty men against those bastions ? Well , there was but one way to go and that was forward . A man could only back into the river , and he 'd never learned to swim . He would never see Constance again . That was the burden of his regret . iii  | " I have a message for my lady , " Robert said . " I bid you take it if I falI . " " Take it where ? " Wat inquired , astonished . " To hell ? My lady is not there . " And so , he meant to go along . Robert turned again to the shore and put one arm on Wat 's heavy shoulder . Wat stiffened ; then slowly relaxed . He spat into the river with contentment . " And scout to Harfleur , " Robert said . " That will follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot in France before . If we get through those bastions at all , I 'll be a very jewel among foreriders , if this is what they plan for us . " " I was in Harfleur once , " Wat volunteered unexpectedly . " A killing in a tavern , and a witness , alas . I had to leave London . His Worship sent me over with a ship of his . They have a trade in cloth that 's woven here . Then the witness died in another brawl , and I had leave to return . " " How does it lay ? " " London ? Why , it 's flat . " Robert jogged his shoulder , and Wat laughed , knowing he was meant to describe Harfleur . " The Seine runs so , " he said , and cut a line in the air with a forefinger , straight from left to right , " and the river Lezarde runs so in its valley . " He cut the first line in half , up and down , and had an airy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a finger at the cross and put the city on the northern shore of the Seine , above where the two lines touched . " The Lezarde flows through the town , then ? " Robert asked . " . . . and widens in one place to make a galley-close , " Wat said . " That 's an enclosed port inside the city for the anchoring of ships . You can see the masts above the walls from the outside . " " Strong walls ? " " Would God London had such walls ! Below the town " ? Wat traced south and east on his map ? " all marshland . " " Then beyond these earthworks there are swamps ? " " And fever . " " How far to Harfleur from the Seine ? " " A mile at least , " Wat said , " and two miles from here to the Lezarde. "  | Three miles through swamps in unknown territory in the dark , if they won through the bastions . Horses sinking to the belly in stinking mud . Wat said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , too , and the water was very cold . " " How many gates ? " Robert asked . " Three that I know . One north , one west , one east . I did not think on defense when I was here before , " he said apologetically . Then he added a dot to the west of Harfleur on his unseen map . " Graville , the abbey and castle , among green hills . " They were silent again , surveying the dark shore . At length Wat stirred . " I 'll see to my bow and shafts , " he said . " I 'll need them soon , it seems . " He left Robert at the rail , thinking . Who had known him well enough to recommend him  --  or was it to condemn him  --  with this foreriding to be done ? York seemed most likely . If York had remembered the Welshman at the Pope 's Head brawl , known his name and then identified another Welshman at Portchester . That was the danger , to be put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting and his Lollardy from the other . This Bible he carried was a firebrand to set off his own burning . Constance had argued with him again and again to the last to let her carry it off to London , but he 'd stood firm against commands and kisses , soft words , angry shrieks , coaxings , tears and all . The Bible was part of his fate . He leaned against the rail , looked at France and saw Wales . Wales , under snow . The winter he got his Bible . A winter raid , for Llewellyn ap Gryffyd thought any weather good for stealing . A bold raid too , in force and much loot seized . IHe 'd been fifteen , standing aside while others quarreled over division of the spoils . Women and horses . Robert had glanced timidly at a pretty girl but had no chance for her , and was wistfully relieved as well . He 'd been afraid of strange women still , though they pursued him . It was another year before he let himself be caught , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his share of the loot at last ; a choice between a captured Bible and a good stout nag . He 'd taken 113  | the Bible . They had laughed and called him priest , reading so much he blushed when a maid looked over and tried to read him ! He had gone out to escape the rough teasing , for the count 's six sons had no bridles on their tongues . As he put the Bible carefully in his saddlebags , standing in the trampled snow beside his horse , he looked over its rump and saw other horses on a distant hill . He 'd raised a shout , and the count came out like an arrow , and turned sober when he counted them , and long-faced when he considered his position . They were in a valley like a bottle with a narrow neck and no bottom . Once the English got in the neck , they could harry him ; for Llewellyn ap Gryffyd was loaded with loot , burdened with captured stock and captured women , tied to his spoils like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all deep snow . He 'd turned casually to Robert when he had done counting . " Hold the neck of this valley until dark , " he said . " Take ten men . I give you your choice . " Robert remembered it yet . Picking the men from those who stood around . The best shots , as he could remember . Their horrified expressions as they considered him , a fifteen-year-old boy dressed in high fashion , the pet of the countess , given to speaking French , taught swordsmanship by a French master so he had a graceful pretty way they never understood , though he could cut other swordsmen to pieces between the flailings of their arms . But the ten longbowmen had stood with him while the unwieldy caravan with its overladen horses and wailing women forced its passage through the snow and left a broad hard trail behind them . He was alone , with the English coming at him , and more snow falling . His first command and such grave necessity . How could he hold this valley ? He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then remembered a time when he 'd feared to walk along an unlit hall when he knew Rhys was waiting for him there . " If he beats you , then he beats you , " the countess said , " but do not seek to avoid all hurt . If fear rules you , then you 're a slave . Will you be your own man ? Then rule yourself and your humors . " He hardened there in the snow . He 'd be no man 's slave , not even his own . He 'd rule fear and be the master if it killed him . There was a harsh streak in his nature , despite his pretty manners . Now he perceived the stony part , and was glad . It was the wall to which he put his  | back that day , unseen by any man , though ten archers were beside him . And so he 'd defended the mouth of the valley , under intermittent attack . He would not venture out from cover , though the English teased him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his men behind rocks and sent arrows from every angle . There might have been a hundred men , and he would not come out to be counted or killed . The mouth of the pass was small and the English uninterested , except as he barred them from their pursuit . They split their forces finally ; kept a little one before him to hold him in , and sent the greater around the flaring skirts of the mountains to chase the struggling caravan and catch them as they emerged from the foot . But they had to plunge through snow also , and they had lost hours facing Robert . They got a few stragglers , but the main band had broken into little segments and they could not pursue the bits forever in hostile country . Wales was no place to divide your forces too fine . Even a shepherd would bash in an Englishman 's head . So they had come back down the valley in anger , on the path broken by the count 's going out . Robert saw them coming , and knew Llewellyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to stay and be ground between the two parts . He had his men shoot into the snow above until it began to slide , and then to rumble , and finally turn to an avalanche that blocked the neck behind him . It left him facing English only . He waited until nightfall and bitter cold , and when he saw them gathered around fires he burst suddenly out of his hole and ran for it with the six men left alive . The English had pursued him and pressed him hard for honor 's sake , but he knew the country and they did not . He rode hard all the night , plunging through snow encrusted with ice , so that his horse was cut and bleeding by the time they reached the castle . Icicles hung from the animal 's nostrils , and he had frost on his lashes and brows . Laboriously Robert swung one leg over the saddle and thudded down to the courtyard on feet that seemed to shatter as they struck . Out of the agony of pain , he noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment it meant nothing . Then lie realized slowly that the Bible had stopped the arrow . If it had not been there , the arrow had gone through to the horse . The beast would have been sore hit in the bowels and have failed him . Afoot in deep rr5  | snow , they 'd have taken him . The English were not gentle with captives , nor did they keep them long . He loosened the girths and slung the saddlebag with its arrow over one shoulder . The groom took his bleeding horse . Robert stumbled into the castle . The countess leaped up instantly and dragged him to the fireplace , and shouted for hot wine . He shivered as he sipped it and tried to warm himself , and he thought of the dead men he 'd left behind at the neck of the valley , frozen corpses now . Yet the arrow meant to unhorse him had been stopped . If he had not chosen the Bible for his portion . . . It had been ordained , therefore , that he should live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count came striding in while he shivered by the fire , unable to control the shaking of his hands , so that the countess must hold the cup . The count stopped before him , and his sons crowded behind him . Robert 's teeth clattered against the cup and he pushed it away . " Wounded ? " the count asked . Robert shook his head . " Good , " the count said . " Tomorrow I ride against David ap Davis , who moves in the snow and has horses better than mine . You go as my lieutenant . " " You promised this to me , " Rhys said hotly . " Then I take back the promise , " the count said . The count and his son eyed each other like animals ; then Rhys strode swearing from the hall . From then on , Robert always rode at the count 's right hand , into traps and out of traps ; except when he was sent ahead to scout , or left behind to cover retreats . Which meant he was often raiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on his bottom in a castle when his neighbors possessed more than he . Inevitably , therefore , Robert became known . Another thing resulted from the pursuit in the snow . The same night when his fingers could move again , he shut himself away and melted ink . A sacrifice was needed . He was a Lollard and a Christian , yet the Welsh blood still believed in omens , in witches , and propitiations . The dark gods of another generation still moved . He had felt their presence in the shadowed glens , he 'd heard them on the high  | steeps of mountains , almost seen them in the circles of stones left from centuries before . His Welsh blood demanded sacrifice . Yet he was a Christian . So he made a Christian sacrifice . The Bible had preserved him ; his life continued because of it ; therefore as much as he lived beyond this was given him beyond his measured due . So , with infinite care and much labor , for he never was a scholar , he inscribed his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Robert stirred at the rail of Dover , moving from revery to reality , from the bitter cold of memory to the hot August of fact . How a man is made up of his memories , he thought , amazed . He is but what he has been . This task on the morrow , now . Morrow ? He looked up at the stars . It was past midnight . It was today . He knelt and offered up his prayers , and after that lay back on the hard deck among the common archers , looked up to the sky , thought of Constance , and slept at last till the captain came to wake him . Whereupon he rose in the darkness before dawn , and picked up his shield . Chapter 16 KING-AT-ARMS roused from his weary plodding when he saw the walls of London , and began to trot when he passed through Ludgate . By the time he reached Thames Street he 'd have stormed at a gallop given leave , with thoughts of his stall to goad him . He burst into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house like a charging bull , to pull her from the saddle and clutch her tight . She kissed him quickly and wriggled free . " Father , " she said in a whisper , " the two horses , the white-foot bay and the chestnut with lop ears . . . . " He knew them for the mounts ridden by Robert and Wat . " Wallace ! " he bellowed . " Those horses leaving this afternoon to be sold into Scotland . . . choose out the two stoutest for our keeping 117  | and put those worn nags in their place . The chestnut and the whitefoot bay look the worst to me . Get rid of them . " And turning away as if it was but a matter of trading spent horses for better , he took Dame Margaret by the arm and led her into the house . Constance sat down at the table with her father while he poured wine . " I had expected you sooner , " he said . " The roads were rock hard , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave to walk . And I lingered in Southampton with Robin , " she admitted at the last . " Two pigeons came home , " he said . " The first with the news that the goods had been delivered , and the second that our competitors were outbid and undone , but I know no more than that . My bluecheck hen , my strongest flier , never came home at all . " " She was never sent , " Constance replied slowly . " I gave her in a basket to the captain of a ship named Dover , with grain for the bird and gold for the man . " " And my bird will return . . . ? " " When Robin lands in France . " He did not rant , as she thought he might , with his best bird still out of the cote . He only poured more wine , and the way he did it .. . She did not understand , but felt as if subtly their relationship was changing . He was not being the indulgent father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured her wine as he would for another like himself , a merchant home after hard travel on hard business . " London was quiet , " she said , " when I rode through . " " Never a stir on the surface , " he said , " but swirling below . King Henry has written a letter to the Mayor , we know that much , but what he commanded we can not find . Yet it can not be for persecution and arrests , for nothing has happened . For the moment , then , the danger 's averted . " " For the moment , " she said wearily . It would rise again . Her father said heavily , " You 'll be wed the seventeenth day of September . " Her heart began to race . " So soon ? " " None too soon , " he said . She looked at him uneasily . He had a somber way suddenly .  | " I sent Paul to sea , " he announced . And she knew , without asking , that Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked . " It is not what he told me , but what he babbled to others . " " What did he say in these babblings ? " " That you left the house the night I said you must not . He said that he returned from Norwich late , and before he jumped down from his horse , you told him to stay in the saddle . " " I never thought he 'd talk , " she said desperately . " He was a talebearer , but of trivial things , and Wat was not here to go ! " He did not flush ruddy with anger , or shout ; nor did he grunt and glower as when he refused to speak at all . " I could not carry him myself , " she said at last in a small voice . She shuddered as she recalled the journey through black streets , with the horses ' hooves bound with rags to muffle their sound . She would never forget the sight of the priest , barely seen , dangling below his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She still felt the dangerous balancing on a saddle , while King-at-Arms snorted . There was no one to hold his head and if he leaped she 'd fall . She soothed him , telling him it was the wind he heard and nothing more , and hoped it was wind and not the sheriff , as she sawed at the rope with more haste than skill , terrified of the body that had once been a man , and never fearful in his lifetime . At last the rope was almost severed . " Paul ! Paul ! Catch him ! " Paul 's horrified white face looking up , then vanishing as he 'd leaped back and let the body hit the ground . Back through the dark streets , the priest like a log over the back of Paul 's trembling horse . The storm rumbling ever closer . They stopped at the first churchyard they passed , and buried him quickly in hallowed ground that his soul might rest . She tried to make the grave look old in the guarded light of a shielded lantern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on his . Then they ran for home like hunted things , for her dress was soiled with dirt and would shout their crime if they were taken by the watch . Lightning lit their way . " Did he tell of the burial ? " she asked her father . 119  | " He swears it was only to me . And they have not dug up the priest . I looked to see . " The first drops of rain , falling as they came breathless to their own gate . By then , she was afraid of what Paul might repeat . " Paul , " she had said , drenched by the rain , " it was a good thing to do . " " You did not tell me , " he said , " that you meant to do it . " " If they take me for it , " she said , " they 'll take you too . " He did not answer . " If you tattle this tale , " she said , " you 'll die of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing sullen . " Here , " she said , " here . Some coins for a night in the tavern . " Her father spoke again and drew her back . " I 'll not reproach you , " he said . " If you are of such a nature as to ride on my business to Southampton then I can not but accept you 're boldly made . I know he was your friend , but he was dead . It was a foolish thing to think he must lie in hallowed ground . " She thought that if she had not paid Paul but frightened him to silence , he might have held his tongue and saved himself . Her father sighed . " I 'm growing old and weary of harshness , " he said . " Ten years ago and I 'd have killed him myself , weighted his feet and dropped him in the river . But now , I could not do it . I liked Paul . He worked hard and honestly , and God gave him the tongue he used too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but leave him in some port where English ships never touched . He 'll make his way . He was a clever rogue , and never feared hard work . " " I 'll marry the old man , " Constance said . " There will be no more fussing . I 'll undo the danger I put over this household if I can . The old man can be managed , once he 's married , and he 'll be an ally if it comes to trouble . " Her father nodded . " I 'll have your mother 's jewels out , " he said . " We 'll put a bold face on it . " She ached for Robin with a need that could scarcely be borne ; but she loved him beyond herself and her desires . She would see him safe before she saw herself happy . Keep him away from them and their enemies , or he 'd be pulled down too . But she would pray for him ! She had already sent up such a clamor  | of prayers that the saints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the way of his protection . " Wear scarlet , " her father said . " Have the dress made immediately . " " The azure with gold flowerets will do , " she said . It was girlish and guileless and cut low in front ; and she could not bring herself to troubling with a new dress for this wedding . When the table was cleared she went out into the court and down the empty quay . She sat at the very end , with her feet above the flood . Night was coming again . How many nights before she was wed ? She did not hate the old man ; she felt almost pity for him . He sent small gifts often : food , a jewel , a bird , a pretty veil . He 'd said more than once , obliquely , that he regretted his age and hoped she 'd overlook it . A man made up in gifts for other weaknesses . Nevertheless , she need not fear she 'd be childless . She would learn to abide him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist on doing the traveling , saying it was too hard for him . If she was clever , she 'd spend more time away than in his house . She closed her eyes a moment . She loved Robin Fairfield so , the world was colorless without him ; black and gray like rain . She stared down into the dark water , relinquishing him forever , as the water flowed out to the sea . So silently , so swiftly , so contentedly , it flowed , after the great turmoil of waters boiling desperately against London Bridge with its nineteen arches set so close they formed a dam . The water was five feet higher on the yonder side and must rip and force its way through . But it grew quiet here . She must learn to be like the water . The time was past for weeping . She heard a thin , sad sound . Turning , she saw the tie-dog at his iron ring , like a statue watching . A lonely , ugly brute of an animal , wearing his life away unloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rope was thick and he made it tighter with pulling . She put her knee against his chest and pressed him back a step . He watched her face , staring eerily , and did not see the rope had fallen to the ground . He was always loosed at night to guard the house , but it was yet day . This was too early for freedom and he did not understand . " Come , " she said , and walked away . When she paused to glance around he was yet by the wall , watching with his yellow eyes . 121  | " Come , " she said distinctly . " Murdach , come . " His thick tail wagged tentatively , then he came at a lunging gallop , all delight , romping heavily about her , his body a half-circle , his ears back and his face wrinkled , his mouth all agape . She sat again at the end of the quay . He peered over the edge , snuffed at the smells and listened for danger . Then he sat down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer , watching for a blow . Then closer still , when it did not come . Then he was beside her , warm and heavy . She put an arm about him , for that he was alive and she was lonely too . He leaned against her , and ran out his tongue and panted . They sat so , watching the darkening sky , and pigeons wheeling into their cotes for safety . Her father came out . She heard his footsteps and pointed to a black dot that did not wheel . A dot that grew ever larger in the sky . " That bird comes fast , " her father said . On it came , disdaining flocks around it , overflying slower birds . Then it began to drop . Its tail spread like a fan , the feet shot forward . The bird alighted on the stable , and waddled into her cote . " My blue-checked hen , " her father said . " Your Robin has landed in France . " Chapter 17 THERE was the heart-pounding excitement of the boat ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to grow more huge and black , until the bow of the boat jerked and beached on pebbles . Robert leaped over the side and ran to the shore , sword drawn , full of fighting fervor that could ignore wounds and danger , and joy in them . And then he stood on the beach like a fool , with others who had followed him on the run , splashing madly to battle as they thought . All stared at the bastions built beyond the tide . More men came running up from the river . They stood also , shuffling . Behind them men cursed at horses flung overboard to swim ashore , now being dragged  | out of the river . Shoes rang as the animals lunged and kicked up stones . More boats came , with torches sputtering sparks at their bows , lighting up the beach and making fair targets of Robert and the others , outlining them in a glow . The torches should have brought quarrels and darts and arrows , but only drew insects to swing in circles around each flare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer in my quiver for us , than arrows for them . Are they sunk in their own marshes ? " Someone shouted , " Here 's the Duke of Clarence , landing now ! " Robert yelled , " Hold your tongue ! " If the French were waiting for the best target , they had him now . " Stand over by the shore , " Robert ordered some men . " Between the duke and the French . " They moved to do so , as the boat beached . Then a man with a proud bearing , who must be Clarence and brother to the king , stepped out and waded ashore . He was taller than Henry but looked much like him otherwise , except he had a colder , graver face . " Who gave that order I heard ? " he asked . " I did , Your Grace , " Robert said . " Who are you ? " " I 'm called Robert Heartless , Your Grace . " Clarence looked him over coolly in the torchlight . His face was unsmiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gryffyd 's lieutenant , " he stated flatly . " That 's recommendation enough to me . I have need now of a fearless man . " He moved his hand in a half-circle to embrace the men upon the beach . " All are Welshmen here . They 're proud and wild and unaccountable , they say . I know little of archers or Welshmen , for I 've followed the sea all my life  --  but if you 're proud , I 'll not command your loyalty , but ask it . Robert Heartless , will you follow me ? " Here was a choice place ! Clarence as his lord ! Yet Robert had hoped to stay near the king , and Clarence would prefer to stay away . The king was hot and Clarence was cold and they clashed if they stayed together . " Give me an answer later , " Clarence said . " I want no man who 's 123  | not wholehearted . Meanwhile , there 's the bastion , and it will not come to you . So do you go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Robert mounted . Wat seized at another , and the men on the beach scattered for mounts for themselves . " Picked men , " Clarence said without change of tone as he watched them . " Picked from under the gallows before the rope was too tight on their necks . " They were a rough-looking mob , unshaven , with eyes that glittered . But every man had a longbow , and feathers that seemed to grow from a shoulder . " Like to like , from what I 've heard of you , " the Duke of Clarence said . " Welshmen , here 's your master , Robert Heartless of Wales . " " How far will you have me go , Your Grace ? " Robert asked . " As far as any ambitious man would , " " To Harfleur , then , " Robert said , and raised his hand , touched his horse with his heels and rode up the beach with the villains after him , heading straight for the bastions , for there was no shrewder way . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they threaded through the narrow passages in the walls , expecting instant death ? because there was no one there . Not a Frenchman in sight to defend his land . Once through , they smelled marsh , and then they were in the swamp , guided by the stars and Wat 's remembrance . And why , Robert thought , as they traveled single file in the boggy path , were the bastions never defended ? As for him , the river would have run with blood before an enemy had even landed . They moved on slowly , with Wat going first , bow ready , guiding his horse with his knees . Next came Robert , then the others , each directly behind the man ahead , for there was quicksand too . They moved in inches , it seemed , hemmed in with stinking , slimy vegetation , stagnant water , mud , dead things that rotted , and insects coming in hordes to dine on Englishmen . They reached Harfleur at dawn , and hung back among some trees southwest of the city . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky turned pink behind the city , outlining the sharp black masts of ships caught in the galley-close within as they tilted in the Lezarde 's lazy current . It was a lovely town , surrounded by a heart-shaped red brick wall  | with the apex pointed to the green wooded hills of Montivilliers to the north . For all their beauty , the walls were well fortified and surmounted by a multitude of towers , each with the leaden figure of a bird or animal atop it , painted in blue or gold . There was a gate toward the west . Robert could see it had a drawbridge and portcullis , and was protected besides by a barbican , or outer palisade , of tree trunks as high as the walls . These trunks had bark still on them , and were clamped together with iron bands into little rectangular forts filled with earth and pierced with narrow apertures . There were more of these barbicans along the length of the town , and each would have to be reduced before the walls could be reached . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooded with water , shining like silver now . Mining the walls would be impossible , the tunnels would only flood . The ditches must be bridged then , under fire from the walls . The Lezarde entered the town on the northwest . No doubt the watergate was well protected . As for the eastern side , he could not tell , but the south was a flooded swamp with two great towers at the exit of the river Lezarde , a chain across , and tree trunks driven into the riverbed to stop small craft . Robert contemplated the strong fortress before him , and thought of the three accepted methods of conducting a siege against a powerful city . The first was to cut off or poison the water supply . But the I , czarde flowed through the town , impossible to divert , impossible to poison . The second method was starvation , now unlikely of success . ' I Ile English army had been delayed so long in Southampton by intrigue that the French crops had been harvested . Therefore , but one course was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news , Robert returned to Clarence and made report . To the Duke himself , and not an underling . This both surprised and pleased him and added respect for Lord Thomas . After that Robert stood about on the beach that had never been defended . Clarence had not been wasting his time . The bastions were now guarded by English soldiers , and more soldiers were being rushed ashore . Small boats darted in the Seine , sails dropped and sails rose . ' 1'liere was shouting over all . Flats and lighters seized from the port of Leure were floating catapults ponderously ashore . The siege guns were of wonderful variety : sheltrons , mangonels , springalds , trepgets , 125  | robinets more kinds than Robert knew names . Some slung boulders and some shot shafts . There were guns here too that used gunpowder , that stank and made a fearful noise when they were fired , but they were hard to handle , heavy to shift , fired too short a range , and forever needed repair . Besides , they could shoot but once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred pounds . The siege would take forever with such sorry weapons . A good mangonel was simpler , and flung its stones as fast as they were loaded . No one seemed to know what was going on . Clarence sat on a horse on the highest slope of the beach , overseeing all and watching the stores pile up in scattered hills , but the bowmen wandered around wondering when they would eat . It took three days to get them all inland and camped on the western side of Harfleur , but at last they were bedded down . It was too hot for sleeping . A warm miasma from the swamp drifted among them . Insects sang and bit . The horses stamped and swished their tails . From Harfleur a church bell pealed and woke Robert suddenly in the night . He got up restlessly , and leaned against a tree to contemplate Graville to the west , where small watchfires burned on the hillside . The king and his lords slept there . No , the nobles were sleeping there , not the king . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the host , but the reason was a matter for argument . Someone had contributed the titbit that spread to the entire army . Along with jewels and relics of saints , sacrificed for money for a war , King Hal had pawned the lying-in gear of the royal ladies when they gave birth , gold basins and such . True , there was little need of these things if the king kept on as he did , forswearing women . Where was an heir to come from ? Ay , he walked , and they guessed why , angrily . There were better uses for the dark hours than walking . If he would not sleep , let him get a prince for England ! All the host agreed . What was the king doing now ? Standing at a window in that abbey , Robert guessed , looking down on Harfleur in the starlight , on the rising church spire , the dark streets , the pointed masts of ships , and the red glow of a farmhouse burning somewhere to the east . He would be thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make . Weaken the city and then assault it . The king was not  | sleeping among his lords in the sweet , cool air of Graville . Nay , he was walking up and down , counting the men he must lose at Harfleur . That was a queer , wry thought . The men who would die at Harfleur . They were alive now , these men ; some sleeping , some talking in the dark . They were alive and would be dead . Robert began to walk among them , moving slowly through the men who 'd die at Harfieur 's walls . He had never questioned his life before , or any man 's life , or living or dying ; nor how it touched others ; but Constance had reached some dim part of him , made him think , and turned him homesick too , for London and the house on the river . He felt infinitely sad . Then he checked his aimless walking . A shadow , darting ! Robert watched , alert . It passed before a campfire . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went swiftly toward it and it stopped , it froze , like a hunted thing pretending it is not there . " I 'll know your name , " Robert said clearly . Men turned around from the nearest campfire . " You 've eyes to see in the dark , Robert Heartless , " some man 's voice replied . " Come from under that tree 's shadow , " Robert said . " Nay , come under the tree , " invited the voice . It intrigued Robert , who liked a lively game . he advanced warily , but stopped out of range of a dagger or sword . The few who had looked up turned back to their own fires . " You know my name ? " Robert asked . " I 've heard your bells before , " the other explained . " Do you jest at them ? " " Nay ! I would I was of such a nature , to wear bells to war . You wear a handsome sword . The king had one like it , they say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though not so cold . " It is this very sword , " Robert said . " He could not have prized it , to give it away . " Soft tones , measured , tinged now with mockery . " I am entrusted with it only , " Robert said , " that it might fight still for its absent lord . " " You turn a sentence like a courtier ! " " I was much with women . I learned it of them , not at court . " " Do they weep for you now , gone to France ? " " Nay , " Robert said . " They 've forgot me in Wales . " 127  | " One then ? A sweetheart ? " Robert hesitated . She 'd been fond , but she was quicksilver , and they 'd known each other but few days , when they were counted . And yet , he hoped she missed him . " Yes , " he said at last , and acknowledged a sweetheart left behind . " I had a sweetheart too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never loved me . She fled to a convent when I would marry , but never told me why . " Silence . How could that be answered ? " Hear them murmuring ? " the voice asked . " Hear them , around the campfires ? Men speak so soft at night . " Then abruptly , " How old are you ? " " Nineteen , " Robert said , " but five years of it were spent in border wars . I fought in Wales for Llewellyn ap Gryffyd , but I 'll serve King Henry in France . " Robert could feel the silence shimmering . " See the sky behind you ! " the voice said . Robert did not turn his back , " They 're raiding out of the host , " he said . " Again ? " The voice turned hard , and sounded more like Clarence now . " The king issued orders against this . He must be sterner . Do you think on a skrie also ? You 're wandering about at night as if you seek to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a battlefield , not a farmer , " Robert said , " As for wandering , I was raised in Wales . I like to know who else prowls in the darkness , and why . " The church bell tolled again in Harfleur . " As to who and why , " the voice said , " I 'll not tell you . Adieu . " Robert let him go . There was no need to follow . It was King Henry moving through his army while the lords slept in Graville . So the king knew of Robert Heartless ? From the Welshmen in the army ? From Clarence ? There was no danger in it , so long as the name was not hitched to the confession on the Portchester road . It was not likely , however , that this calamity would come about . Robert was not given to long worry over short possibility . He turned back to his own campfire . It was the Duke of York who 'd be the danger . York could set Robert Heartless at the Pope 's Head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make one dangerous identity of two men . York had half known him by some small thing , though he 'd been masked and muffled . Not the accent . There were thousands of Welshmen in this host , and they all talked the same . It would be another trick , or habit . Traitors were experts in such matters . Still , York could not prove whatever he might suspect , and besides , what interest could a duke have in a squire ? Robert walked into the circle of his own men and sat by his tree again , his backside firm against his saddlebags and the Bible in them . here was the sword that laid its edge to his neck . It would be best to burn the Book or throw it into a swamp . But then , he 'd have been dead in Wales at fifteen , if the Bible had not saved him then . Clearly it was Heaven 's intent he have it . He 'd keep his Bible . Yet it would then be well to avoid the short , fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , he 'd find Lord Thomas , Duke of Clarence , and say he 'd ride with him . York would stick close to the king where the chance of royal favor was , but Clarence would get as far away as he could . Regretfully , Robert made his decision . He 'd join with Clarence , and serve King Henry through his brother . Chapter i8 AT GRAVILLE , they kept regal array . Tents were everywhere , of red and blue and stripes , set gaily under spreading trees near the gray stone abbey . Among this splendor wandered heralds and minstrels , chaplains , pages , pavilioners , watchmen , clerks , priests , purveyors of the spicery and buttery and napery , countless others , all to do with the royal comfort ; though the king was seldom near to enjoy it . But here , on good green grass , in sweet air , in sunlight by day and good bright torchlight by night , walked the nobility of England . And here sat the Duke of York behind a table , under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foliage to speckle the paper before him . He was writing another book . And making another plot . York was an intelligent man , with a crook to his thinking , put there 129  | by ambition he could neither realize nor completely relinquish . He knew it was too late now to reach for more than he had . He knew he stood at a stone wall and hammered with bare fists . Yet , if a man persisted long enough , even a wall might weaken . Henry of England was a reader . He 'd brought chests full of books to war . Such a man could surely be pleased with one that praised him and his war . So the Duke of York had begun another book to advance his fading hopes . What he had failed to gain with swords or poison , he might earn with a littler weapon . A pen . He wrote in English , the vulgar tongue , for King Henry favored it and therefore in that language York made his book , though he could have used Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was learned . His jeweled fingers glittered as his pen moved in slow , fair curves and angles . The lords walking about did not see a desperate man , but a studious one . He set down how Henry had landed in France on August 14th , and fallen on his knees at the moment of landing , imploring divine aid and protection in his effort to obtain justice . ( And must he be forever on his knees ? Especially on those hard stones . ) King Henry had conferred knighthood on many of his followers . A good cheap way of being knighted , York thought , for he was parsimonious in many ways . Plenty of honor and no expense . ( But no knighthood for Robert Heartless , though he wore a sword with three gold ostrich feathers for a hilt , which Henry must have given him . Still , Henry 's thinking was devious , and his new policy was to favor first one man , then the other . The Welshman must be watched ; he might wiggle into favor . ) On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and here it was arranged that commands would be split , as the city was , by the river flowing through . Henry would take the western side , and his brother Lord Thomas the east . ( And with the Lord Thomas , who liked separate command too well , went the Welshman Robert Heartless . He could not be in favor , if Henry let him go . ) On the 19th of August , the Lord Thomas made the long circuitous trip around the southern morass , to get to his eastern command . The road had been utterly destroyed by the French , and the swamp turned to a sea by flooding . ( The Welshman led them through and was not dainty how he went , so it were swift . Many a horse slipped , and many a nobleman landed in mud to send up noble curses . Yet they said that  | Clarence was pleased for the speed , though they went dangerously in darkness , for the French Lord de Gaucourt had marched the day before into the unguarded eastern gate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Graville . Henry had raged , and sworn at Clarence for not closing the trap around the city sooner . Clarence only said , without a smile , that it made more Frenchmen to hold for ransom later . Henry had not been amused . And Clarence had marched the same night . ) But of course , York thought , he could not write of that . He lifted his pen , pleased the brothers had quarreled , and looked across the downward slant of hill , past Harfleur and her ditches and river glinting in the sun , over the walls to the eastern side , where Clarence was . There was the best command . It was from there the final battle would probably be launched . It was there that heroes would be made . It was there that Robert Heartless drew first blood for England in this war . ( Had Henry let the Welshman go to earn a reputation there ? ) York clutched his pen hard and wrote on , scowling . Since the 19th of August , Harfleur had been completely invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the French barbicans , to discourage citizens from prowling into the English host at night . Harfleur lay now in a circle of blackened earth . At the outer perimeter of this burned ground were the stone-throwing guns for the siege , dragged into position under the darts of the crossbowmen on the walls . Traps of wood had been built over them to protect the gunners , and these squealed like butchered pigs when they were hoisted to spring the gun or fire the bombards . And the noise ! The bombards boomed , the catapults squalled , men shouted ; boulders hurtled into the sky and crashed down with a sound of thunder . Stone walls collapsed and bricks and mortar exploded in avalanches of wreckage . The boulders split on impact and splinters flew like knives . People screamed inside when they were hit . But from Graville 's hill , it was almost pretty . Oh , he 'd hear a faint crash when a house was smashed , but chiefly the war was visual : puffs of dust and flying debris by day ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into conflagrations . There were constant fires , and by their glare the watchers in Graville could see black shadows , frantic as ants , each night . There was constant activity then , when the French dared retreat from their walls and leave only watchers there . Then 131  | they fell upon their impassable streets . They took the bricks , the fragments , they took the very stones flung in , and patched their city . Each day the walls crumpled , and each night they were rebuilt . Yet not so high or firm as before . The drama of the rising and falling walls of Harfleur continued like the tide , while the crossbowmen of France and the longbowmen of England kept the air alive with darts and quarrels and huzzing shafts . And , York made rueful note , while Harfleur fought , some four thousand armed Frenchmen sat on the other side of the Seine and watched . They did not dare attack King Henry 's larger army ; and got no reinforcement from Rouen , where their own king was according to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spies . They were no danger yet . But if King Henry 's forces diminished . . . York did not write the last . Nor did he tell of the wounded , everywhere now . The worst were sent home to save supplies . Their war was done , let them take their bellies to England . Such as could fight remained , limping around in bandages . The monks at Graville had a hospital , and the wounded archers grouped together and speculated on their wounds and the walls ; if the one would heal in time for the destruction of the other . It was September now but the walls were still too high , and the French still fought too hard . The war had settled into a routine of deadly monotony on strict rationing , for somehow ships left with wounded but did not return with food . There was little sport to be had to repay a man for going short . King Henry had made firm rules against raids out of the motley host . Looting would be punished by death . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were curbed . Decent women must not be molested . Yet , to avoid hanging his entire army over this , King Henry permitted another kind of woman about , but not in his camp . They were gathered at three miles distant and warned if they came closer their left arm would be broken . A few came . None twice . Three miles away  --  a good long walk to cool hot blood , but many a man hiked it . Unless he was among the wounded . Bloodletting calmed them . But naturally , York did not write it . Another burden had been added . A curious listlessness among the  | men . It was not the languid air of lazy men , nor the weariness of tired men , but rather the dreaded apathy of sickness . Archers stumbled about their duties flushed of face , insect-bit and feverish . Some blamed it on the smells . The cattle had all been killed and the entrails flung into the swamp to steam there in the heat of day until they stank . Some blamed it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not come . Some blamed it on the mussels the bowmen gathered from the creeks . Some blamed it on the fog that drifted over the valley camps . Yet it made no difference what they ate or where they slept . King Henry gave away to the archers his own supplies , but still they sickened with the bloody flux that turned a man 's bowels into thick red blood that poured out as from a gaping wound . Many men died of arrows , but more died of the flux . But of course , York did not write it . He had much to consider in his book . This would not please Henry , that would not please Clarence , and the other did not please him . He would not write the name of Robert Heartless , though it was known now in the host . Robert had been in that first skirmish when some Frenchmen trying to follow their Lord de Gaucourt into Harfleur had lacked his luck at finding an unguarded gate . They came one day after and ran head on into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roving dog . He might be anywhere . He 'd been where the French sought to slip through . It was only a skirmish , but it was first blood , and the Welshman 's name had gone to Henry . One of the Welsh lords had seen to that . Strange , how thick the Welsh blood ran . In the midst of twenty thousand they maintained aloof identity , and there was Robert Heartless , clad in scarlet , a rallying point for a treacherous race that longed for their wild heroes . They cared nothing for books or learning , but their heads went up like so many startled stags when they saw the Welshman 's scarlet flash in glimpses between the trees . For all his riding , Robert Heartless had breath at night to sing . You could hear it almost anywhere if you listened for it , and already too many did . He lent the only spark to dreary days of sickness and woundings . They talked of him , and called out greetings when he came . And when he thundered by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaped to their feet by their fires and listened until he was gone . 133  | At Graville , however , Robert Heartless was but the subdued tinkle of small gold bells , though they were heard too often , for he had almost daily contact with the king . Clarence sent him on personal matters . The Welshman came in a whirl of flying clods kicked up by horses . He stayed only long enough to give his messages  --  some written , too many verbal . York did not like the latter . It meant the king must see him then , while his men waited outside like a pack of bandogs , surly , vicious and unapproachable . They stared with open contempt at the luxury around them , and spat and commented in Welsh . When Clarence 's lieutenant came to Graville , York always watched and listened . Henry gave no sign of anything ; but then , the day was past when he flung his favor to any who smiled at him . Yet he liked Welshmen , he liked gallantry , and he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , untangling the tangled skeins of royal favor , and what man had it , or who might get it next . Henry openly favored only the Bishop of Norwich , Richard Courtenay , but that was old friendship and York did not fear old friends , but new ones . It was a climber who must be watched , a man emerging from anonymity . The time for him to climb was now . Henry was lonely , his war waxed desperate . He was a man who needed another to listen to his problems . Who ? York set spies to watch the Welshman . Which was how he found that Robert Heartless went often on his own business to the beach in the Seine , and got letters sent via a certain ship named Jesu . York usually stayed away from the lower lands . He feared the sickness there . Yet on September loth , when he learned a ship had come and Robert Heartless would surely go down , for it was Jesu of London , he rode there himself . Most of the fleet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was unloading cargo into lighters . Piles of materials in canvas bales were already pyramided on the stony beach , and it was among these stacks that York made his way on foot to find the captain . For he 'd had another thought . Sometimes the sea captains had a pretty taste in wine or food , and such good things could be bought . York wanted to add to his secret store , for his only pleasure was eating and he had a constant horror of depletion.  | But this captain proved to be rough-faced , rough-voiced and rougher still of temper . " Dainties ? " he inquired , and looked York over from head to foot . " We carry only dainties for the French . Arrows . Arrows fletched with goose and swan and parchment . No more is on my ship . " York did not believe him . He had a crook in his nature , and thought all men like himself . So he lingered on the beach , well hidden by the cargo piles . He even made a little hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poked a finger in . And promptly jerked it back bleeding . He swore , and put it tenderly in his mouth . Then with both hands he pulled the rent he 'd made more open and peered in . Arrows , all pointed straight at him . He sucked on his finger again . A crunch of footsteps and he swung half-round . Out from an alley between the high-piled bales came the captain followed by some clerk . The captain stopped in the middle of a sentence . " Now , sir , " he said , without respect , " is this knightly of you , to doubt a poor sailor 's word ? " York pulled his punctured finger from his mouth and put it behind his back . The clerk whined , " . . . but if you did not mark which was swan and which was goose and which was parchment , how can I check what was delivered ? " " What he sells , " the captain said , " he delivers . " The clerk frowned , and saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And snatched it out . He looked pitifully at the bloody thing , then glared at York as if it was his fault . " Arrows , " the captain pronounced , with delight at this misfortune , " sharp ones , too . " Then suddenly he went alert and bellowed , " You ! " He strode a step down , out of sight . " Not that one , not that with the black crosses ! That 's not for you . Load the others and leave that on the beach ! " York heard a thud as something was flung angrily down . Someone swore . A horse snorted . Then grunting and heaving resumed . " Well , then , " the clerk said , resigned , " if we have not food enough , we 'll have arrows enough . I 'll check this as delivered . They 're carrying it off as fast as it 's landed , anyhow . " He walked off with the captain , pebbles rattling beneath their feet . York only moved as far as the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused the fuss , dropped away from the others and set alone . It was wrapped as if arrows were within , but marked on the side with black crosses . He 'd watch , York decided , and see who took it . With determination he pulled down a bale and sat on it . The shafts inside felt like welts to his fat behind , but he waited . He had learned to wait in prison . At length he heard more horses clattering up ; too fast for the sumpterhorses that moved only at a walk . Then , exchange of greetings . He moved behind canvas piles , working his way cautiously , all sound hidden by the laden sumpterhorses that crunched along continually . He got close enough to hear the voices of the newly come . Welsh , flowing like a rushing tide , frothing and pulsing . London , he heard , and arrows and my lady . He risked thrusting his head out and saw a rough , squat man with a brutish face , incongruously clean and well shaven for such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A knife flashed , the canvas was slit . The brutish man dug in with a hand and yelled , " Arrows , lads ! Proper arrows , fletched with peacock , the best in all the world . I 've poached deer with these ! " Instantly he was surrounded by archers , buried in them as they struggled and reached and grabbed . York knew them . The Welshman 's ban-dog pack . The brutish voice rose over the tumult . " No excuses for missing shots now , lads . The Frenchmen will be beautiful with these in their chests ! Peacock ! Peacock ! Who 'll have arrows with peacock ? " An arm waved up out of the millrace of bodies , and peacock arrows gleamed in the sun . Broken English spattered like a fountain . Typically Welsh , they were seizing every shaft they could , while taking the other side . They clutched the peacock and swore that swan was better ! Nay ! others bellowed . Gray goose ! The loud archers ' argument covered the beach as they pushed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be learned here . The argument of goose and swan had begun with the first arrow and doubtless would continue to the last . York walked away from the uproar unheard , passing behind each pyramid and glancing down each alley . Suddenly he stopped dead and jumped back , to be hidden . If those damned ban-dogs would only cease their yelping so he could overhear ! It was impossible . A few strides away the captain talked unheard , and handed a letter over .  | A pair of hands came from behind a stack of bales . White paltock sleeve showed at a wrist . A flash of scarlet and ermine sleeve . The hands gave a letter with the left and took a letter with the right . The captain tucked his into his belt and patted , to indicate the infinite degree of safety  --  then strode away , glancing toward the incredible uproar of the quarreling archers . Messages , York thought . A private line of communication . By whom ? To whom ? He could guess . To the merchant Chapelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that valuable thing , privacy and a swift-sailing courier ? He had to know , a guess was not enough . York moved boldly now , the sound of his footsteps covered by the noise . lIe passed the alley and saw the man . Robert Heartless , reading as if he 'd devour the message with the intense concentration of one who has no speed of recognition of written things . York was a little contemptuous . Robert Heartless sweated to snatch reluctant meanings and never saw an enemy poised near him , or turning in swift retreat . So Robert Heartless , the Lollard of Portchester , was in communication with the merchant Chapelle in London . York smiled happily as he labored over the shale to the horse he 'd left by the bastions . Lollardy and Chapelle , eh ? What an intelligent man might do with such knowledge . What he might do ! York started immediately for Graville . It did not pay to linger here . The flux was rampant . And he had the Welshman now , his destruction was in these hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path , retracing his way to Graville , York wavered . He was not a simple man and he did not like a simple road . IIe 'd never run a straight course in his life . So he played with another thought . Consider if it would be worth while to make an ally of the Welshman , who had rich friends in London , and the favor of Clarence , brother to the king . It must be remembered that a dead enemy was only carrion , and if he tore Robert down , he cleared a vacant place into which still another man might step . Also , if Hal died without an heir , and Clarence was made king . . . This matter would take thinking . If Robert Heartless must be destroyed , this Lollardy must be used now , or the opportunity lost  --  for if Clarence was king , the heretics would run free . On the other hand , if he was to be courted , he might 137  | be a dangerous ally , or else a very strong one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it might feel . He had never known it . And besides , if he let this chance the Lollardy offered go , he could still bring the Welshman down . Robert Heartless was honest , and uncompromising to boot . When he made a step forward , he would not step back . He would not lie , and he would not learn that art . He was stubbornly honest . Such men could be ensnared . York was feeling merciful when he rode into Graville , and went into his tent for some wine and sleep and plotting , which he did not get , for grave news awaited him . The Bishop of Norwich was stricken with the flux . York crossed himself for his squire 's benefit , but when he turned away he allowed himself a smile . The flux , so . It was killing strong men , and Courtenay had been sick when he came . If Courtenay died , and it was likely , there was the empty place ready immediately . Henry was lonely and a man who must talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careless favor counted . With Courtenay dead , this was the chance for York . Then his smile faded . Or the chance for the Welshman . York looked out from his tent somberly at the small groups whispering under the trees . Down the Welshman , he thought , almost with regret . He could not afford such an ally . It had been but a tempting thought . The Welshman was too dangerous . He must be stopped and the time to stop him was now , with evidence in hand . If once Robert Heartless had the king 's ear , it were too late . Therefore , now . York put on darker garments as more seemly , for Henry always expected the worst when a friend was stricken . Then he walked through the camp planning what he must say . He would make it clear , delicately , that he had always been maligned , that he was a good man turned traitor because of his generation and not by wickedness inborn , a traitor by dictate of fate and not instinctive nature . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The years had taught him . There were too many between him and the throne . He was too old now for the insanity of wholesale murder , too old to grasp at a witchfire that tempted a man into a bog . He had learned , and he 'd proved it . He 'd kept out from the whirlpool of  | treason into which his brother Cambridge dropped and drowned . He had survived , and his hands had been clean throughout . He liked this feel of righteousness and good conscience , with nothing to be concealed . His ambition was gone and this gave him ease . All he wanted now was a high place and security there . Well , he was turning honest , but he 'd not forget that too much truth was bad for any man . He was admitted to the king and found Henry sprawled in a chair , amid a crowd of silent nobles standing around with sullen faces . " Hal , " York said , for it seemed warm friendliness was a good approach among these cheerless men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't fret , Hal . Send your bishop back to England . He 'll recover there . " " Not there , or here , or anywhere , " Hal said . He was sunk in gloom . IIe 'd brood now , York thought . There was desperation in his face , and he picked with one hand at a report on a table by him . It was then that York noticed Clarence , leaning by a window looking out . Clarence , here ? He cared for no bishops . He only cared for war and how it went . There was something to do with the war . " Sire , " York said , " not more ill news on top of all ? " " We 've a man captured , out of Harfleur , lowered from the walls , " henry said . " So long as he was captured , " York said , reminding of the good . " He was the fourteenth lowered , " Henry said . " So he told us . We have captured ten . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four men over the walls and through their lines , running for help to the King of France himself , ignoring Bouciquaut , still sitting on the other side of the Seine , leashed by royal order . Harfleur was sick and like to die , but she was risking the dash to Rouen , and sending many in the hope one would get there . Therefore Harfleur would not die quickly . She would linger , hoping for succor from her king . She would fight with desperation , her back to her red brick walls . She would fight till the last brick was kicked loose . And then she would fight in her ravaged streets . Her temper was clear . It might not take long , those dying gasps , but it would take long enough . Illness was the enemy in the English ranks , fighting Harfleur 's battle ; her strong ally . The host was cut in 139  | half . Most of their ships had gone home . Bouciquaut was ready beyond the Seine , and King Charles , if he came quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river and squeeze him in between . York glanced at the king . Hal was looking out the open door toward a certain outbuilding used for a hospital . Courtenay would be there , York thought . He put his hand gently on Hal 's shoulder . " I 'm sorry for it , Hal , " he said , " truly sorry . " The king moved , to get from under the hand . " My friends all die , " he said . " I fear to make one of any man . " " I do not fear to be one , Hal , " York said . It were well said , he thought . The king had looked up a moment . " He might recover , Hal , " York said . And wished it in that moment . " I 'll pray for him . " For Hal was pious , and liked prayers . " he 's my friend , " Henry said hopelessly . " That 's his sentence . " " There are many others , sire , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the entire army . " " As , " York said , " the Welshman Robert Heartless does , going everywhere . " Henry did not respond , as if he did not hear . But by the window , the Duke of Clarence turned and stared with a cold look on his cold and narrow face . The king 's eyes were closed ; his hands were clenched . Outside a trumpet sounded ; it was time to eat , and little enough they 'd get . The king 's eyes opened at the sound . " I can not even get food for them , " he said . " Perhaps the Welshman could , " York said , deliberately . " I 've seen him on the beach , talking to the captains . He gets . . . packages . " " I wondered on how you spent your time , " came Clarence 's voice , like a whip . " Following my forerider , while others fight at the walls . But then , a man stays out of danger so , not fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no coward , ever . Henry said , " Hold , York ! I will not have you quarrel ! " Clarence said , " Sire , this is a traitor I can not abide . If he comes to the eastern side while I am there , I tell you plain , he 'll never come again to the west . " " My lord , " York said , with misgivings that Clarence chose to interpret this publicly as an attack on him , " I was but suspicious that  | the forerider stayed strong while others starved . I sought to do your business and find food by following the Welshman . " Clarence said , " As to the first , he 's used to an empty belly , and as for finding food , we could fatten the army on what you 've hidden . " The king looked at York . " I did keep some small portion aside , " York admitted . " Have it out , " the king said , with the flash of eyes that showed he 'd not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , " York said . His fine viands , flung to yeomen ! God ! Mussels from the creeks suited them . His wines , his dainties . " I but waited till they were needed before the battle . " He ceased protesting . Henry had a way of growing angrier if excuses were offered too long . " This captain on the beach , " Henry said . " ... brought a special package from London , marked differently ? " " Containing arrows , " Clarence broke in roughly . " I 'll swear to it , sire . If you take a traitor 's word over mine , then let me retire to England . I have no place here . " This was plain talking ; too plain ; it was dangerous . Clarence was a bulwark before the Welshman , and did not care who knew it . And Clarence was next in line for the throne . York protested he meant no harm but was zealous in service to the crown . Clarence stared at him , icy . Clarence was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next time he 'd wait till Clarence was gone . York shivered a little . He could not get to the Welshman by open accusation . It must be done secretly and quickly . Particularly it must be quickly . When the king again bade them cease wrangling , York looked abject . He begged Clarence 's pardon if aught was taken wrong ; he 'd meant no harm , no harm to any . He even walked over and offered to kiss Clarence 's cheek . But Clarence turned away . 141  | Chapter 19 SATURDAY , the 14th of September , turned to a bitter dark night . Winter threatened outright and the chill drove all to cover who could go , and kept the rest by their campfires . Only sentries walked , and these Robert passed without difficulty , for all the host knew Clarence 's man and that he rode everywhere , at any hour . It was a long ride , away from the army , and only Wat with him . He had much time to remember how his men had looked when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No man was to take off on a scry . They shivered by their fires and seemed chilled and harmless , as a snake when it is cold , but there had been a conflagration ? some farmer 's house  --  and a little shouting in the forenoon . He hoped it would not stir them . He 'd chance it . The cold would keep them pegged . And he wanted news of Constance . Therefore , he rode with Wat until they reached a gibbet set where two highways crossed , and here they halted . The empty gibbet squeaked in the rushing wind that soughed among the trees and bushes . The moon played at hideand-seek with the clouds . It brightened and darkened , and brightened and darkened , as did his expectations . " They 'll never come , " Wat predicted at last , after they dismounted to save the horses . " Their courage is in their moneybags . " " I know little enough about the breed , " Robert said , " but I know this . A merchant will come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . The Frenchmen know His Worship will come if he said this . They 'll keep the rendezvous . " They waited , shivering ; and the Frenchmen delayed interminably . The moon went dark again ; and stayed dark long . " I hear bells , " Wat declared in a hoarse whisper . " I hear hooves , " Robert replied . They listened together , alert to any sound above the restless wind , the squeaking wood of the gibbet , and the sound of a stream gurgling near . The clouds thinned overhead , and a weak glow filtered through . " Four horsemen , " Wat whispered . 142  | Four great bulks on the road , approaching warily , without torches . " Ho ! Travelers ! " Robert called . The four horses halted under the wooden gibbet . Robert and Wat mounted instantly and approached with caution . Until in a sudden brilliant brightening of the moon that lasted but an instant they could discern the form of the merchant Chapelle on the great horse , his belly resting on the pommel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant said . " Are you just come ? " " Lately , Your Worship , " Robert said . Wat muttered at the politeness . " And your trip ? " Robert concluded . " Holy Mary sailed like a saint , and I 've seen no one since I landed , " the merchant said . " Ah , here 's the moon again . You 're gaunted , if I see right . " " Clarence is no man for letting me sit idle , " Robert said . The merchant 's body heaved with silent appreciation . " You wanted war , " he said , " and you have it . " " Here 's a strange thing , " Robert said . " I hear bells and not my own . " There was an embarrassed pause . " The bells are mine , " the merchant said ; then , half ashamed , " I laughed at yours , but envied you ; yet my belly is too great for such a girdle . At last I thought on this . . . here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver embroidery in a band about my shoulders and silver bells sewn in . " The merchant 's voice turned complacent . " The color of the gown is violet , which is not true in this light . The fur is fox , dyed violet . The sleeves are to the ground , and the fur will wear , but it 's the thing . . . the thing . I can scarce bear to put another robe to my back . Well , we are not met to talk of fashion . ' What will the Frenchmen offer me ? " " Lace and cloth of gold and silver , I know . I talked with one man ; with the others I had no time to linger . I gave your writ messages to some , and passed others onward to Dieppe . " " I hope they have some German hawks , " the merchant said . " With unbroken feathers and a fierce eye . " " I do not know , " Robert said . " Whatever comes , it will be welcome . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Robert said , surprised . 143  | " No man works for nothing , " the merchant said , very brisk . " I 'll consider you in my prices . How must the profit be divided ? " Robert hesitated a moment . " The archers sent back to London , " he said , remembering the sick faces and bodies broken by illness . " Use my share to buy them comforts . A hospital is cheerless . " Wat made a disapproving sound . " Hospital ? " the merchant said . " Ah , the sick ones . What is that illness , Robin ? " " The flux , " Robert said , surprised at being asked . " God save us , " the merchant said with horror . " No wonder the monks took the men off the ships at night . Flux ! It would scare London out of its wits . . . and its breeches ! How are you ? " " I did not like a saddle for two days , " Robert admitted , " but when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very like . " " Call it what you will , flux or marsh sickness , " the merchant said , " it 's ill news . It was given out the men had arrow wounds . We thought there was hard fighting . Sickness ! Henry can not fight with sick men . " " He must , " Robert said . " If he loses this war , he 's the son of a usurper and they 'll howl for the Earl of March . I heard him say that himself , to his brother . " " How close is victory ? " the merchant asked . Robert was silent . The merchant grunted . " Well for us , " Robert said , " that Burgundy was paid . He 's well bought . He 's kept Bouciquaut anchored . There are rumors an army is coming from Rouen , but I 've seen no sign of it , though I scouted twenty miles in that direction . I say King Charles ca n't move his army to Harfleur , or Burgundy will skip behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose France . " " I would not want Burgundy behind my back , " the merchant commented . " I doubt an army will come . " " If it does , we 're lost , between Charles and Bouciquaut , " Robert said . " If it does , warn me , " the merchant said . " They 'll strike at Calais next , and I can use a warning to get my money out . " " I see torches , " Wat announced . " Torches ! " The merchant snorted . " Are they afraid of the dark ? 144  | They should be more afraid of lights bringing men out of the host for a raid ! " The approaching horses halted in a body , as the moon slipped out and showed them six men below the gibbet . The terror of the others could be felt . But when Robert offered no hostility , they began a slow approach and cautious recognition , until both groups were only a little apart . " By Jesu and Holy Mary , " the merchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called so strangers would think it an oath and not an identification , " here 's a hearty welcome for one who 's come to toss his gold away . " A man exclaimed shrilly in French , a recognition , and the two groups merged and a babble broke over them . The torches showed fear-ridden faces . " A man must be cautious these days , " said the shrill-voiced Frenchman , pulling at a sparse gray beard . " A cautious man is a poor man , Pierre , " the merchant said . " What makes you tread so wary ? " The little man jerked his beard . " Rotting crops , " he said , " unending rain , rivers in flood , the blood taxed out of us for armies never raised , robbers swarming to seize what 's left , and . . . " he caught a breath and looked fearfully around , " . . . spies everywhere . " " The wolf eats , the sheep runs , " the merchant said succinctly . " I 'll deal with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one said hastily . " I 'd not have come unless I meant to . I can not get you Eastern horses , as you want . They 're stolen the moment a hoof hits France , but the other things . . . yes . " Then they surrounded the merchant , all still ahorse , for none of the Frenchmen dared dismount in case a shout was raised to run . But after a while fright was forgotten in anger . It seemed the merchant was inclined to drive a bargain . His were the ships , he reminded them , his the markets . . . his , Almighty God be witness . . . the risks . He must have something in return . A babble of French cut the darkness , with cries of Robber distinct ; the faces under the torches contorted and looked to Heaven for help . Behind them , the sky turned red toward Harfleur . Another fire within the city , Robert guessed ; a bad one this time . Toward the end 145  | of the haggling , even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , all the faces turned that way . Then , the little one called Pierre said , in an altered voice , " ... all to be shipped from Dieppe . " " Agreed , " the merchant said . Details were settled , and at last the French with their dangerous lights rode off . Robert moved his horse beside the merchant 's . There was a question he had ached to ask . He waited a little , while the merchant talked of the profit to come . He saw His Worship would avoid what he wanted to hear . He cut across some talk of scarlet cloth , embroidered . " Perchance , " Robert said , " you can tell me of Mistress Constance . " The merchant hesitated . " She 's in London , " he said at last . The moon went dark , and the fire burned fiercely toward Harfleur , wavering red in the sky . He had hoped . . . how he had hoped . . . that she would come . " It 's best left as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he understood . Robert could not forbear . " Is she wed ? " he asked , and held his breath till the answer came . " Soon , " the merchant answered reluctantly . " When ? " " Must you have the day named ? You 'll suffer for it when it comes . " " Tell me , nonetheless . " " You 're no man for avoiding trouble , " the merchant said . " The date ? " " Two days hence , September 17th . " Two days . . . ay . It was past midnight now . Two days . " Nevertheless , " the merchant said , " my house is always open to you , whenever you come to London . " Robert said nothing . At length the merchant turned his horse . " If it 's aught to you , " he said , the last thing , grudging , " she loves you , and she 's wept ! " Then he galloped off , with his three varlets behind him . The moon peered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hooves faded . 146  | Wat indicated the burning in the sky . " They 're raiding , " he said . " Pray not those Welshmen of yours . " Two days and she 'd be wed . God , let the old man be good and kind . Wat said , " We can not stand all night . " Mechanically , Robert touched heels to his horse , and they both rode back to the burning . There were always fires in Harfleur by night , set by the flaming arrows , but this looked to be a fierce one . He rode a little faster , and came to the top of a high hill overlooking the eastern part . The fire was not within the walls ; the city lay stark in a red glow , a small fire in her heart but a greater one without . " They must have made a sally , " Wat commented . " That 's one of their barbicans burning . " Another barbican had been reduced . It was another step to the red brick walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinned cruelly as his teeth set hard with scorn of bought men . He hated Burgundy now and pitied Harfleur , which was betrayed but did not know it and fought on in honesty . God pity you , he thought with bitterness , and knew it was treason to feel so , and did not care . He thought of the Lord de Gaucourt , who had ridden in the eastern gate and reinforced a city that was doomed . De Gaucourt , who had flung his heart to a cause that was lost . Yet Robert understood . He loved , too , but not a city . And his love was also doomed . But he could not stand all the night , moody and sad , looking down on a fire-edged city , thinking of Burgundy 's betrayal that was saving England now . So he rode down from the crest . His men were where he had left them , a somber relief . He rode up out of darkness , unexpectedly ; and there was a stranger among them , who stood up abruptly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger left hastily . Robert dismounted and stared after him . " One of York 's spies , " Wat hazarded . " The duke watches close . " Robert turned to the men , shivering by the fire . " Who was that ? " he asked . " He was passing , sir , " the man replied , " and brought us news . Richard Courtenay 's dying . " King Henry 's friend ; King Henry 's bishop . This was a night of ill news for all . " What was his name ? " Robert persisted . 147  | " He never told us , sir , " the man said . " He spoke Welsh . " Robert turned to Wat , but Wat was already gone . He returned a little later and came to Robert , and bent to dig a knife into the ground to clean it . " York 's man ? " Robert asked . Wat nodded , and straightened . " That 's the second one , " he said , and sheathed his blade . Chapter 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteenth of September . Robert heard them as he splashed puddled cold water on his face . It had rained toward morning . The hill was wet and slippery as he went to a clear space to overlook the valley toward Graville . A long procession snaked down from there , to vanish beyond the far walls of Harfleur , and reappeared again going toward the beach and remaining ships . The bells tolled on from the abbey and were answered from the convent high on one of the hills behind him , unseen but present in the voice of its deep bell . King Henry had protected that convent ; put guards there during the first violent weeks when his host swept the country bare of edibles and loot . Now the nuns tolled for his bishop newly dead . Robert crossed himself . They said he was a good man . There was death of many kinds . The death of the body ; and another , the slow death of a love that must wane because it could not wax . Soon she would be married . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could do . Or would do . He wanted protection for her ; only let her be safe . Wat came up beside him , clearing his throat . " More burning ? " he asked , seeing the dark smoke drifting upward . " Fires in the city , " Robert said . " The rain put them out . " " I wonder there 's anything left to burn , " Wat said , and spat . There was much left to burn , Robert thought . He was tired and hungry and a little sick of the flux , but there was much left to burn . 148  | He began to walk , up and down , because he must wait for orders and could not stand still . He understood , then , a little of King Henry 's restlessness . Up and down , within the limits a man must set and other things set for him . All men are prisoners , he thought . And was glad when Clarence summoned him . " What 's the tolling ? " the duke asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert replied . " He was dying last night , Your Grace . " They both thought of York at Henry 's side , whispering , bowing , sublimely friendly and sublimely untrustworthy . Henry would be lonely now , and lonely men make mistakes if they try the sound of their thoughts upon another mind . " I like you , Robin Fairfield , " Clarence said unexpectedly . " I have troubled myself to show it . " That was obscure , Robert thought , and could not interpret the meaning . " I do not mind your independence , " Clarence said . " Such men can be trusted with vague orders . . . or none at all . Even if they kill other men 's spies . " York must have been complaining , then . Had Clarence stood against York for him ? It was even possible . Clarence was cold , but the coldness was of good steel . Robert noticed now the shadows in the duke 's face , his dull eye , the ruddy skin gone gray . Pray God Clarence did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles restless at their back , all hanging on Burgundy counting his gold . " Robin , " the duke said , " I am going to Graville , to my brother . I want you to ride round the city and tell me what passes within , and without , how all things are , the temper of the city and our host . And if I should be . . . sicker . . . when you get to Graville , report all you find to my brother . " Robert nodded , understanding . Clarence was considering urging Henry to assault the city now . They did not get along , these brothers ; but Clarence would be nigh him now , and not for favors he might pry out . Duty came high to Clarence . If Henry died without an heir , this would make a sturdy king . 149  | " Now do I thank God , " the duke said , " for a man that I can trust . " He put his head back wearily against the oaken chair and closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowed , and left . It was September 15th , but winter was coming faster than the battle . Robert watched his men saddling , pinch-faced and blue-skinned , with their breaths shooting forth like smoke from a dragon 's nostrils . It would be a hard ride again . They mounted and began to file downhill slowly , the horses down-headed , picking carefully in the slippery , browning grass . It would be a race between time and defeat . The barbicans of Harfleur were broken and marked by the fire of skirmishes fought over each little fort . The walls behind them were breached . Open places showed the destruction in the city . Harfleur was in desperate state , yet the English were as close to defeat . King Henry must make assault , if he would , before he was too weak to fight but while the city was yet too strong for his taking . It was a desperate balance . Yet Robert did pity these people ; and did not recoil now from thinking it , or calling it treason himself . They fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives to slip through at night to beg for the assistance they should have freely had . But their liege lord King Charles was not a man for chancing it ; he would not leave his capital unguarded for terror of his Duke of Burgundy marching behind . Burgundy was popular , and a perpetual danger to the French crown while he sulked in his duchy , counting Henry 's bribe . Robert was wrathful that it was the price of Burgundy that would determine Harfleur 's fate , and even his . Not gallantry , not truth , not fierce heart or tireless defense . He was all in a turmoil as he rode by the broken walls . His emotions were as stirred by thought as his bowels had been by the flux . There seemed ' a new man growing in him ; a complex man and not a happy one . He viewed his enemy with compassion and his ally with hatred . It was better in Wales . If he was not your friend he was your enemy . If he was your enemy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see your enemy and wish him your friend ? God ! That unmanned you , made you hesitant , turned a man to a coward in his heart , fearing to see 150  | the other 's blood . He looked to the walls he would cross in assault , and dreaded the thought of the fight . It was not new . He had looked down often in the long , dark , rainy nights and pondered uneasily on beginnings and endings and the crossing of paths and the relation of one human to another . It was robbing him of gaiety and careless laughter ; making his happy gold bells a lie he wore before the world . He had thought to enjoy this war ; he loved bold dash , he 'd wanted men to leap up and shout as he galloped headlong by . He 'd had a taste of it in Wales , and thought to gulp it here . But joy had seeped away . He prayed for Harfleur instead . It was Christian , but not manly . It had made him the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His genius was for action and he knew it . But the thinking stayed , like a new-won habit persisting past forgetting . The bishop was dead . What would it do to King Henry ? The thin ranks of his friends grew thinner , and vanished . If Clarence grew sicker , and it seemed he must , without rest or ease , who would dare wrestle with York in the silent pull for power that had now begun ? If Henry 's friendship was given , all favor went with it . He would not listen to councils . He listened to friends . Constance would be married Tuesday . It overrode all his thoughts , stayed by him almost continually , and gave a burning and a sickness and a kind of death . He made his circuit of the walls with this , and his report . The next day , the 16th , he circled the walls again with the thought of Constance gripping harder . The merchant had been right . It were better to have never known the date . This made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back to his hill and thought , By so much time is Constance nearer the hour . He smelled smoke . Flames . There were always flames . Since the assault was first considered they had bombarded the city constantly to give them no rest within . Flames did not startle him , but habit made him look for cause . Smoke mushroomed up and hid all in a thick concealing cloud . Then he saw flames licking . Outside the walls . That set him moving . He rode down for a closer look . Did they still sally from their breached walls ? Did they , the heroes , dare ? Wind blew the smoke and then he saw them , silhouetted before the inferno of burning English bulwarks . Crossbowmen ! French ! 151  | More corning , men-at-arms galloping from the smashed wall , with varlets rushing ahead to fling a hasty bridge across the ditch . The English archers , surprised below , stood against the sudden sally , raising bows with shaking sick arms against targets obscured by the smoke . Then , suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hillside in retreat , pursued by crossbow quarrels . Englishmen were dropping everywhere . Robert shouted , " St. David ! " and charged downhill . His men gave a ragged shout ; he heard hooves start behind him . he jerked his lance free of its leather bucket and lowered it ; the narrow green pennon streamed straight . His horse drove ever faster on the slick footing ? it must rush or fall . He dashed through the retreating English ; they yelled to see him and leaped out of his way . And they turned to fight again . For as his lance crashed into a mounted Frenchman 's armored breast and broke , long English arrows huzzed past him to rattle on French armor and break on Harfleur 's walls . He flung aside the broken lance butt , drew his sword and began to fight in a swirling whirlpool of action  --  men afoot and men horsed , men in wool and men in armor , determined and desperate men . In the midst of the fighting and rearing , squealing horses and shouting came a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risked one glance to see if he was surrounded . And saw fat York , half-armored , coming down in furious assault . York swept into the French like a hammer , and smashed them back . Now they were outnumbered . York fought the same swirling battle , breaking the French in two . Then he left the smaller segment to Robert and took the larger for himself . He pushed them back , he gave them no time to retrieve their bridges . He galloped over , the first of all his men . The others jammed through after him , and turned their attack on a break in the walls through which the Frenchmen were fleeing . York was trying to get into the city ! ' The fight turned violent there . Citizens swarmed out , children on the walls flung bricks . Still York tried to force in . Behind him the wrecked barbican flared into flame . The sky above was black with writhing smoke ; lashed with the red tongue of fire . Beyond the breach , men-at-arms swarmed to repel the attack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As suddenly as it began , it finished . York fell back . 152  | His men scrambled with frightened horses over precarious footing . One horse broke through a board and fell into the ditch with a splash . The French leaped from their lost barbican and fled across the bridge after the English passed it , dropping torches as they went to fire the wood . The crossbowmen knelt and fired after the English horsemen . York retreated hastily , galloping up the hill . Robert followed him and they paused finally , grimy and smeared with smoke . Only the dead lay below , illumined by the burning French barbican and burning English bulwarks . York looked down , his armor touched with brilliant red where the fire reflected on silver . Robert saw how , ludicrously , the fat man had parsimoniously had his armor patched in a great curved plate over the belly , to accommodate his newer fat and make the armor last for still another war . " That was well fought , " York said abruptly . Robert discerned something more behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fighting . He thought the duke was going to .. . give advice ? York appeared to reconsider . His face went crafty . And he rode off suddenly with his men behind him , a fool 's figure of a fighter bursting out of his saddle , his armor clanging loosely and no helm on his jowled red face . The rain began again in earnest . The flaming stores were quenched . The barbican turned to blackened lumber and smoldered to leave a smell of burning , but the bulwarks burned for days . Nothing more marked high courage from a desperate city . The English bodies were taken up for burial . The French were left for the citizens to retrieve by night . Robert pulled his mantle hood over his head , against the rain , and resumed his scouting toward Graville , pausing first to talk to this man and then to that , until he had made the circuit , returned to the battlefield , which now was empty , and paused a moment . It was the evening of the sixteenth day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and wet . He must go on to Graville now , to report to Clarence ; but the place where he had watched so often held him for a moment . The horses must be rested and stood head down , while men threw anything they could find across the empty saddles , striving to keep them from wet . Robert closed his eyes a moment and listened to the sounds below . The drip and gurgle of rain , the swish of wet leaves , wild squalling in the city as wood was pushed to shore a teeter-153  | ing wall . Stone grated as it was hoisted . They took the boulders cast in all day and levered them into the open breaches . He tried not to think of Constance and her wedding day tomorrow , while he listened to Harfleur struggling tonight to last till then . Even in the rain , the fire-arrows arced over ; but with the wet , no conflagrations were started , though the smell of burnt wood still overhung this place , together with the odor of damp earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wat came over , saying one sought him . Wat sounded doubtful but the man was at his shoulder and spoke up , a voice in the rainy dark . " My lord , " he said , " the duke of Clarence commands your presence , instantly . " Wearily Robert said , " Wat , get the men to horse . We ride to Graville . " " Wherefore , my lord ? " the messenger asked . " Clarence is not there , but at the chapel toward the south and east . " " There ? Tonight ? He was in Graville this morning . " " He 's back , " the messenger said , and lowered his voice . " They quarreled , " he explained . Robert did not like this matter but the brothers did quarrel , it had happened before , and he had had just such orders from Clarence before . He did not want to leave here . He had a feeling that the French would sally again ; gates meant nothing , with great stretches of wall through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had the wrecked barbican for cover , and the memory of a fight that morning . The night was cold and rainy ; it hindered fires and aided men creeping out in a surprise attack . Now that he thought on it , tonight there were not so many sounds of building . They were not patching this wall , but leaving a sally port . He 'd not take his men . Send a man ? But if Clarence wanted him , the message must be verbal , and if so , . he must go himself . " Do you have a sign ? " he inquired of the half-seen messenger . " He does not beg you , squire , " the other said . " You 're commanded . " Robert grunted with dislike . " Wat , " he said , " stay behind and watch the wall . " " Let the others watch , " Wat said . " I want you here . " 154  | " My lady wants me there , " Wat said . There was no use to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble , or a trap , it would be well to have Wat near . But he did not like it , any of it . He thought of York again , who 'd have guessed where he 'd be by now . This had the smell of a trap , with enough truth to bait him in . York 's touch , there . Simple , but sly . Almost , he disregarded the command . But Clarence had always worked so , casually , with some wry word that Welshmen only worked well with freedom . If the messenger had now tried to run off , Robert would not have gone . But the man waited calmly and offered to show the way . So Robert chose another , in case of ropes stretched across a path to bring down a galloping horse . The man did not protest , but followed . Yet not so close as Wat , who rode with his knees . His hands were occupied with an ax in one and a knife in the other . The rain was bad for his longbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So they 're still eager to fight ? " Hal asked . " Like the fiends of hell , " York said . " Even the children on the walls . " Hal stopped his pacing . " How was it that you rode on the eastern side ? " he asked . York was taken aback , but smoothed it over . " Clarence is sick , " he said , " I thought it well to oversee ? " " Clarence will oversee your death , " King Hal said bluntly , " if you poach again on his preserves . He 'll set his Welshman on you ! " Then the king paced again , thinking no doubt of an army wrecked with sickness , and Frenchmen still hot to fight . That headlong attack , York thought . It had fired even York , to see the Welshman , one moment sitting quietly ahorse , the next flying clown the hill with his lance before him and his pack of ban-dogs yapping after , and defeated men turning to fight again . To have that wild flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight like a trifle . Never to count the cost or care for the short-155  | ening of a life . Never to think , I might die ! God , the boy was his enemy but he did admire him then . He could be caught in errors of judgment . York was glad of that . He 'd seen one at the walls ; that headlong leap to battle , when it would have been better to wait ; to draw them out , cut them off , and destroy them away from their walls . An error of judgment , or training ? Count Llewellyn had always been a chance-taker , greedy for a horse or bit of gold ; the boy had been trained in his wild fashion  --  see a sword and draw on the instant ! And he 'd almost corrected the Welshman , told him the error . Almost that gallantry had tricked him into giving good advice . The Welshman had halted beside him , dirty and breathless ; and even in the heat of battle , his face had been blank ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fox , or a fool ? Or a man growing apace in hostile times ? How he had been schooled to keep his thoughts away , to give no hint to any of what was in his mind ! Almost , York had told the Welshman , you should have held back a little longer . But the blank face startled him in so young a man . Thank God , he had not spoken ! The Welshman would have listened . Henry paced on . York watched him covertly , thinking again of the vacant place by his side . Who now would have Henry 's favor and trust ? His golden trust . York 's fat fingers twitched and his embedded rings all glittered . The Welshman would have made a good ally . Gallantry was worth something . It fired men and brought them running ; those who lacked courage came to borrow it . He would have made a leader . York thought now in the past tense , as if the Welshman was dead . He could afford regret for a fallen enemy . The Welshman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was as well he 'd taken steps , called his confidential spy the moment his armor was off , and set the matter afoot . Yet this was one plot he could not enjoy . He was getting too old , mayhap . For the rest , let Henry condemn Robert Heartless . He 'd but think it the evil fate that always pursued him and caused him to be the instrument of destruction to those he 'd rather favor . It would be a fine twist of plot . Robert Heartless hung by Henry 's order . How long had it been now ? Hours . He 'd ridden back to Graville , set his spies off sniffing instantly . . . It must be almost time . He must listen for sounds of excitement outside . 156  | Henry paced , and thought . It could go on for hours . Henry would worry at whatever decision he 'd made , drive it here and there , and see if it stood off the dogs of weakness . York walked to the table and poured wine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry gave him one look and swung around to face him sharply , then stepped backwards two steps and sat down . York 's glance faltered and fell . Hal would take nothing from him . Four times convicted of attempted murder . Henry still remembered the poison , sixteen years ago . York sipped at the cup himself , and felt cold for all his fat and his woolen gown . He knew surely , in that moment , what he had refused to admit before . Henry would never trust him , and nothing could change that now . Vengeance burned in him suddenly , brightly , till his hands trembled and wine slopped over and ran down his chin . He wiped it hastily . If it is not I , he vowed , it will be no one . If you will not have me , I will see you stand alone all the rest of your life . A growing tumult outside caught at his agitated attention . He had meant to listen sharper . He finished his wine at a gulp . Henry half turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York came up and they both looked out , among the tents and torches that flung wild shadows dancing , like a witches ' holiday . Men were grouped together in excitement , standing on a high point where the trees had been cleared away to afford a view of Harfleur when the king wished to overlook the site . " Smiling , York ? " the king said coldly . " Why , Hal , " York said , " I am guessing the city is suing for surrender , and I have prayed for your success . " " I never trust you any time , " Henry said , still icy , " and even less when you smile . " Then he turned and hastened out toward the nobles , only waiting at the door , to herd York out before him , contrary to all etiquette . But he 'd not have him in back , York thought resentfully , and stopped when he 'd reached the group . Now the king edged around them . No man followed him ; a man could lose much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So King Henry stood alone , his shoulders against a tree , looking toward Harfleur with the torches lighting one side of his face and body . Below , the campfires of the host stretched in small lights all around 157  | the walls , ending at the black swamp in the south . Within the walls of Harfleur were several conflagrations waving redly , and the fire arrows arced continually like moving yellow darts . But this was common stuff , seen every night . It was the uncommon sight that made York put his hand before his mouth to hide his smirk . There was a tall hill on the eastern side , a bald hill , with a convent on the top . They 'd heard the bells often enough , banging away for any reason , but it was silent now . It was a burst of flame ; like a gigantic beacon , a burning mountain . While York watched , a fierce flame bolted high into the sky ; surrounding flames flared . Something had collapsed . The sky was alight ! York looked covertly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spot almost , shocked . His face could not be seen , only a glimpse of an ear and a jaw , but the jaw was working . King Henry was swearing in fury ; he was a madman now , in a rage such as only the Lancaster line could engender , like an insanity . It was a raid out of the host , against his command , a slap to his royal face . And Henry being pious , a burning convent was like spitting on his crown . York sidled closer to the king , being careful to be a little before and seen , to add a dart to enrage him more if he could . Henry turned a black look on him , and jerked his head straight to stare intensely at the calamity across the valley . " There will be help on the way , Hal , " York said . " I had wounded in the sally out of the city , and left my men on the east till all could travel . They 'd not let this tragedy occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the life of every man concerned in this , " Henry said , harshly . " I 'll have their lives ! " " My men will catch them , " York assured him . " Sire , they know I am obedient to your commands and diligent that they be carried out . They will investigate a skrie . " " If they be not the cause of it ! " Henry shouted , and turned on him . " Sire , no ! " York said . This was too clbse to the truth ; he must turn the king aside from these thoughts ! Give him something else to attack . " Nay , never . I have only pity for those poor nuns . God help them , with men who 've had no women . . . " He crossed himself . That hit the king . His eyes closed as if he 'd shut away the world and its awful sights ; and swung away to hide his face , his arm bent a little and fist closed as if he 'd strike across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a man galloping , " and pointed to a swiftmoving torch stretching long , high above the ground , borne by a mounted man hurrying toward Graville . All watched eagerly . Few cared about the convent , but the diversion meant much . Here was something more lively than sickness , more interesting than defeat . If the king would bleed for helpless women , let him . As for them , give them news ! The galloper circled below and began the ascent ; the sound of hooves came to them , slowing as the horse labored on the climb . Henry turned and hastened to intercept the rider as he swung through a thicket out of sight , burst through tents , and leaped to the ground before them , gasping . He flung the torch to some lackey . His horse ran a few yards and stood , heaving and dripping sweat . The man looked about , frantic ; saw York and ran to him . York gestured to the king , standing with his back to a stone wall of an abbey building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now by royalty . " Were the raiders captured ? " Henry demanded . " Sire . . . yes ! " The boy scrambled on his knees , to face the king more direct , and struggled for breath . There was blood on his face . " Are the nuns safe ? " The boy spread his hands helplessly . " One . . . one , sire . . . I think . . . was dead . The others ... " He did not know . " Who did this ? " The boy 's head was down , his chin on his chest . " Must it be dragged out of you ? " the king demanded , and took a step toward him . The boy flung up a hand , as if expecting a kick . " Robert Heartless , " he said , " sire , Robert Heartless and his men ! " York 's hands clutched convulsively ; but he guarded his face , and luckily , for Henry with his chin out , and fury in his face , searched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . York was frightened then , and he had never feared the king . " Sire , " he said , controlling his voice , that it did not tremble , " he was trained by Count Llewellyn . " What else can be expected ? he had asked . He had damned the Welshman , but with a kind of plea . York was pleased with his reply , 159
