Besides Formosa , Nationalist China has another beleaguered island redoubt . Oyster-shaped , about twice the size of New Jersey , with 3,000,000 inhabitants , Hainan Island lies in the South China Sea , only 15 miles from the Red mainland . The Japanese used it as a training ground and springboard for their conquest of Indo-China , Malaya and Singapore . From Hainan last week TIME Correspondent Wilson Fielder reported : <P> <P> Tiny , thin-faced General Hsueh Yueh is known as China 's Little Tiger . Thrice he clawed the Japanese at Changsha in 1941 . Now , on tropical Hainan , the Little Tiger watches the weather with a prayerful eye . It is the season for fogs . Usually they roll in from the mainland , and this season they could cover a Communist invasion armada . To prepare Hainan 's de fense , Hsueh says he needs " just one month more . " <P> So far the fog has held off . Every day the small Nationalist air force ( 30 B-25s , P-51s and Mosquitoes ) roars from the blacktopped airstrip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field glasses from the roof of Haikow 's Presbyterian Hospital , their bombs can be seen exploding on Luichow Peninsula where the Reds have been massing . The flyers also drop leaflets that urge Luichow fishermen , whose boats the Reds must commandeer , to sail away and avoid destruction rather than become " running dogs of Soviet Russia . " <P> Many fishermen are responding . Under the guns of a Nationalist naval flotilla ( a few destroyer escorts and smaller patrol craft ) , they are bringing their boats to Hainan . The Communists are smarting . " Landing operations , " admitted a recently captured Red field order , " may be delayed . " <P> Rifles &; Rice . Two months ago the tattered remnant of a beaten Nationalist army started pouring into Hainan from South China . Hungry soldiers roamed Haikow 's crooked , dirty streets and sold their rifles for rice . The Little Tiger struggled for discipline . Demoralized troops were moved out of the towns into the countryside , paid in silver dollars ( for a change ) , reorganized and re-equipped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best units are digging in along the white sand beaches of Hainan 's northern coast . <P> Invasion from the mainland is only part of the Red threat . Hiding in the Five Finger Mountains , whose timber-clad ridges reach up 7,000 feet in central <P> Hainan , are some 25,000 Red guerrillas . They control about 40% of the island . <P> Hope &; Heart . The Chinese came to Hainan in in B.C. For centuries the island was a torrid Siberia where imperial dynasts often dumped political foes . * Between 1939 and 1945 the Japanese transformed Hainan into another kind of imperial base . On the undeveloped , malarial outpost , they established military camps , dredged a deepwater harbor at Yulin on the south coast , developed rich iron mines , built a hydroelectric plant , cement factory and fish cannery . The Japanese enterprises have deteriorated because the Hainanese lack replacement parts and maintenance skill . Hsueh is tearing down one of two arsenals and shipping it to Formosa , " We do n't have the money to run it , " he claims . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and ammunition we need to defend ourselves .
