Yehudi Menuhin added another anecdote to the Toscanini legend . In an interview with syndicated Columnists Tex &; Jinx McCrary , Menuhin told of the time he and Toscanini were rehearsing in the peace &; quiet of a hotel room . <P> " The Maestro was playing the piano when the telephone rang . He was so absorbed in the Beethoven concerto that he positively refused to recognize this foreign noise-but for me it was like trying to ignore a fire siren . Toscanini kept right on playing , and I was certainly going to continue as long as he did , but I could feel the pressure , the temperature rising . Any second , something had to explode . " <P> Something did : the telephone rang a third time . Testifies Menuhin : " Deliberately , the Maestro got up , walked over to the phone , picked it up , and with one mighty yank he pulled it , plaster and all , out of the wall . All this without saying a word . Then , completely relaxed again , at peace with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play the Beethoven concerto . "
