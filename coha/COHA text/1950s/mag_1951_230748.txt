In the food industry , nothing has caught on faster than frozen orange juice . Its sales have soared from an initial 225,000 gallons five years ago to an estimated 31 million this past year . But the paradox is that the more juice the industry sells , the less money it . makes . Last year , both Minute Maid and Snow Crop-the industry 's big two-had a rough time . The trouble ? The cost of oranges skyrocketed from 46 a box to $2.12 , while at retail the industry has been racked by price wars which have recently forced juice producers to sell below cost . <P> Last week Snow Crop took a drastic step to end some of its risks . It sold all its Florida processing plants ( concentrated-juice capacity 14 million gallons a year ) for $11 million to a growers ' cooperative , the Florida Citrus Exchange . As a clincher , Snow Crop 's boss , 60-year-old Charles W. Metcalf , quit his job and took over as manager of the concentrate operations . Under the deal , Snow Crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most of its worries about gyrating orange prices would be solved . <P> But a similar remedy did not work in California , where a growers ' cooperative started marketing the Sunkist brand of frozen juice earlier this year ( TIME , June 25 ) . The California growers found that even the tax advantages held by a cooperative ( no taxes on distributed profits ) can not solve all the industry 's problems of cut-price competition . Some 14,000 members of the California Fruit Growers Exchange have sunk $4,000,000 into Sunkist 's processing machinery . But the exchange , which recently set below-cost retail prices to try to grab the frozen concentrate market away from the older eastern brands , is losing money , and orange growers are squawking.
