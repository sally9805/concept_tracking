TIMES : In February of 1946 Sir Stafford Cripps , Chancellor of the Exchequer in England , ' said : " No country in the world , as far as I know , hag ' yet succeeded . in carrying . through a planned economy without the direction ; of . labor . Our Objective is to carry through a planned economy without the direction of labor *-* s . " On March 10 , 1949 , the Parliarnen tary Secretary of the Ministry of Labor announced that , between October , 1947 , and December , 1948 , " 374 directions were issued to men who were in the mining industry compelling them to , remain in that industry and 132 directions were issued to men in agriculture keeping . them in agriculture . * * * .

TONER : Brooklyn , March . 5 ; 1950 . Campbelt4en Eyck Bill Opposed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I am surprised to note the silence in the papers on the Campbell-Ten Eyck bill Shortly , to come before the Legislature , which provides - that all animals in the pounds shall be turned over to the . experimental laboratories . This bill does not at all affect the desirability  --  or the reverse ? of vivisection . That question does ' not arise . If it is defeated the laboratories will continue to obtain animals at ' any time as they do now . Making animal supply a. state contribution makes the process easier and less expensive for the laboratories . It has nothing to do with what could possibly be considered as the progress of medical science . It does mean that the animal " shelters " will be turned into mere collecting places for experimental laboratories . Heretofore when one has seen a lost or starving animal one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kindly treated or mercifully killed . If this , bill is passed , this will be impossible . It would end , in great measure , the animal welfare work which , has been laboriously ' built up for many years . In view of the interest shown in supporting the S. P. C. A. shelters recently when there was talk of putting them under government management I am sure there would be equal interest in this matter if the public were informed that such a move is being planned . We have until March 15 to protest to our state Senators and Assemblymen  --  unless , of course , the bill is brought up before that time . AMELIA LEAVITT HILL . New York , March 7 , 1950 . Blizzard ' of ' 88 Recalled -  - -  - Anniversary of Famous Storm Brings Back Memories To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I am a member of the " Blizzard Men of 1888 . " For four or five days during the blizzard I was on duty as chief clerk to the general baggage agent of the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I remember , March 11 , 1888 , was a gloomy , raw kind of a day , not very cold and without snow . On Monday , the 12th , I awoke to find a foot . of snow on the ground . It was snowing so fast and so heavily that it was almost impossible to see across the street . In those days we had horse cars . None were running that morning , and so ? I walked from ' Ninth Avenue and Forty-second . Street in order to take the ferry to cross to Weehawken . It was not very cold , but still snowing heavily . We crossed the river on what I believe was the last boat to get over for several mornings . Those who had crossed over ahead of us were stranded in the Weehawken West Shore Terminal . As . I remember , there were parts of two theatrical troupes going to Oswego . Those who had passage to leave the city did not get away for at least a week . We ' suffered no hardships . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies had brought in their trains with provisions but could not get over into New York . Thus we had plenty of food . The buildings were well heated . - Tuesday , March 13 , was very cold , with . a high wind . The snow still fell heavily . On the river there was a heavy flow of ice and a high wind brought in an immense tide . Boats begame uncontrollable and could not ' enter the station slips . It was so cold that animals were taken into the cabins for protection . In New York , snow was drifted to a depth of ten or fifteen feet and clearing it was very slow . Narrow passages were cut through these drifts . The total average fall was more than four feet . Of course , there were shortages of food , particularly milk , in the city . J. M. LANE . Washington , Pa. , March 7 , 1950 . Allocation of Theatre Tickets To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Timm : Your editorial of March 3 " entitled " The Theatre Code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public for hit shows at box-office prices . The Mayor 's Committee recommendations deal only with brokers and theatre owners , and by indirection condones the practice of an inordinate number of house seats going to the theatre owners , plus 75 per cent of the remaining tickets ? being allocated to brokers . Does n't the administration have power in the ' licensing of theatres to see that a fairer allocation is made to the public , and a minimum of 50 per cent of all seats made available to the public at box-office prices ? The enthusiastic response of the general public to the City Center 's programs is proof that when there are seats available to the public at fair prices . for good theatre , the theatre is encouraged . JOSEPHINE M. STAPLETON . New York , March 3 , 1950 . Arbitrary Basis for Retirement To THE EDITOR Of ' THE NEw YORK . Tams : Your editorial on the retirement of professors opens the door to a reconsideration of the whole question of retirement . It seems to me to be manifestly unsound and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of 65 , the ' any other age . Not ' a few are at the maximum of efficiency at 65 . A Presbyterian minister , now well over 70 , was retired and went to the Pacific Coast , where he built and organized one of the finest churches on the Pacific Coast , of which he is now the highly successful , minister . I am not sure that retirement is not wrong in principle . At least it seems wrong ' to use age as the criterion . I can readily understand incapacity as a criterion but it ' has no relation to ' age . It is time ' for us to challenge , if not the theory of retirement , at least the arbitrary basis now employed in determining when a person shall be retired . WILBUR . LA : Roil Jr . Washington , - March 6 , 1950.
