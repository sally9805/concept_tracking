txt LONDON , June ** AngloIranian Oil Company , with the backing of the British Government , will offer Iran ? 10,000,000 tomorrow as a down payment against future royalties , authoritative informants revealed tonight . The offer will be made when Anglo-Iranian 's negotiators meet for the third time in Teheran tomorrow with officials of the Iranian Government . The offer was first suggested by company officials in Teheran , who referred it back to London today . The step was considered here by the company 's home office and the Foreign Office and was approved . The United States Government has also been advised , it is understood . The offer is considerably less than the demand made by Iran for 75 per cent of the company 's net revenues since March 20 when the nationalization law was adopted . Iran also demanded that the remaining 25 per cent be deposited in a mutually acceptable bank as a contingent fund against possible company claims on Iran . Estimates here are that this demand would involve about ? 18,000 , - 000 in addition to another ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ' deposit . " This proposal has been // officially characterized here as " quite unacceptable . " The latest British offer is conditional . While there is no desire to put " pressure " on Iranian officials , officials here say the Iranian Government will be expected to halt provocative and inflammatory anti-British propaganda circulated by official and semi-official agents in Iran . Furthermore , there is hope that the offer will be accepted and that this will be taken by the Iranians as an earnest of Britain 's good intentions . Britain has accepted the idea that the nationalization of Anglo-Iranian 's installations is certain , and there is no feeling here that anything can be done to prevent it . " What we do expect is that nationalization will be carried out calmly and intelligently and with full regard for the tremendous strategic importance of the oil supplies to the Western world , " one official said tonight . There is confusion here over the exact nature of Iran 's latest deI mands on the company and for that reason there is hesitation to speculate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be accepted . " The Iranians have been very vague in their demands , " another official said . " If they an . vague through accident there is hope for negotiation . However , if they are being deliberately vague then the chances are they are more inte- : - ested in the principle of nationalization than in immediate financial assistance . In this case it is hard to see how any negotiations can/ be successful . We 'll know tomorrow . " Iranian Demands Compliance Special to TAB NEW YORK TIMES . TEHERAN , Iran , June 18 ? Hussein Makki , influential member of the Government 's " take-over " mission , now in the southern concession area , warned today that if the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company did not comply with the Iranian demand for 75 per cent of the company 's profits by tomorrow night , the Iranians would take the ? oil installations Wednesday . In the course of a tour of the Abadan refinery , Mr. Makki said that Iranian retaliation would consist of turning off the valves so that the company could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Iranian National Oil Company , projected successor to AngloIranian ' will take over the entire refinery establishment and start delivering oil against receipts , " Mr. Makki declared . " If they AngloIranian meet our demands we will not take any action for they will be working for us . " It was precisely to urge against statements of this kind at the moment when talks between representatives of the British company and of the Iranian Government were entering a critical phase that United States Ambassador Henry F. Grady had hope to see Premier Mohammed Mossadegh this morning . However , after a conversation last night with Basil Jackson , deputy chairman of Anglo-Iranian and the company 's No. 1 negotiator , Dr. Grady agreed that as the company 's answer was imminent there was perhaps no compelling urgency in making another call on the ailing Premier . The Ambassador received word that Dr. Mossadegh was nevertheless eager to talk matters over with him and accordingly the two men will meet tomorrow , The British Embassy and company officials were confident that full instructions from London would reach Teheran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive proposals for a possible settlement of the oil dispute when the talks with the Iranian Government delegation are resumed tomorrow night . Teheran papers carried dispatches from Kermanshah Province , the country 's second oil producing area , describing a border raid by Iraqi tribesmen who had allegedly crossed the Iranian frontier Saturday , entered a village , killed two civilians , injured a soldier and carried off a woman . The Government was reported to be contemplating a complaint to Iraq through diplomatic channels . The Iranian Government canceled at the last minute today a ceremony that had been scheduled for the signing of a British-Iranian civil aviation agreement . The ostensible reason for the cancelation was the desire on the part of the Government to give further consideration to one of the clauses of the agreement , which has been under discussion for more than two years . Meanwhile , a stop-gap agreement between the two countries has been in force . The Government signed a similar civil aviation agreement with Denmark today as scheduled in a ceremony at the Foreign Ministry .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
