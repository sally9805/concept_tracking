txt Costlier smokes are expectea to boost profits for the big cigaret companies , at least temporarily . In addition , cigaret sales are neaoing upward , company officials indicate , despite two recent reports which revived the controversy over the alleged link between smoking and lung cancer . Results of the recent wholesale price increases on regular and king size cigarets , which went into effect June 17 , wo n't show up in earnings for the six months ended June 30 , tobacco officials say . The price hikes came too late in the period , they assert , and orders on the companies ' books when the increases were announced are still generally being filled at the old prices . But they believe the higher prices should make a difference in the second half of this year , although they concede that certain costs , such as advertising and tobacco , may also rise . Effect on Philip 3lorris " For the last six months of 1957 the increase could make a difference of 40 cents to 50 cents per share over what we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kibbee , secretary and treasurer of Philip Morris , Inc . " For all 1958 it could amount to SO cents or St per share over what we might have earned , " Mr. Kibbee adds . In the second half of 1956 Philip Morris earned 52.23 a share . and for all 1956 it posted earnings of $4.06 a share . Most other companies , though reluctant to spell out the possible effects on profits , agree their earnings should get a fillip from the higher wholesale prices . Mr. Kibbee gets his estimate by figuring how many thousands of regular and king size cigarets the company sold in past periods and multiplying that by 35 cents a thousand , the size of the price increase . Judging the Rosy Picture However , company financial officers , including Mr. Kibbee , are quick to ? note that such a rosy profit picture can he misleading . " IL 's unrealistic since it assumes that everything else will remain unchanged . " says a spokesman for American Tobacco Co . Factors which could take a bigger bite out of future profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of making a cigaret , has been getting more expensive . For example , this year 's burley crop , used extensively in making filter-tip cigarets , will be marketed in the fall , and tobacco men say they wo n't be surprised if the leaf price tags are higher than last year . " There was no increase in burley acreage , and this could have an effect on tobacco prices this fall , " says A. H. Galloway. , vice president and treasurer of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co . Advertising costs , a big item in a cigaret company budget , are also going up . One company said it was taking a look at its advertising budget for the second ' half of this year and may " revise it upwards since there 'll be more money available . " Penny-a-Pack Profits With the price boosts , profit margins to the companies on regular and king size brands average a bit more than a penny a pack , compared with about . 4-5 of a cent before the increase . " Profit margins have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reynolds ' Mr. Galloway . The filter cigarets cost a bit more to produce than the regular and king size smokes since it takes two extra machines to put on the filter , executives clairit But since the filter takes up space in the cigaret normally used for tobacco , there is a saving in the amount of tobacco used . With the growth of the filter tip cigarets. there has been more demand for different types of burley leaves  --  generally those that grow higher up on the stalk  --  to " get more flavor through the filter . " company officials say . The resulting demand has pushed prices of this type of leaf up close to the levels of the other main tobacco staples . " The prices have tended to equalize . " Says William L. Perry , vice president and treasurer of Liggett &; Myers Tobacco Co. , Inc . Question of Quality Although conceding they use " heavierbodied and higher-flavored " tobacco in the filtered brands , the companies do n't like to say the quality is inferior to non-filtered blends . " Our Hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strike and Pall Mall , " American Tobacco emphasizes . The filtered smokes make up about 40% of the total cigaret market , . industry observers believe , and some estimate that share may increase to near 50% by the year-end . The price increases have put the king size brands in the same priCe range as the filters , with the regular size about a cent behind . Some tobacco officials speculate that the reduced price difference might hasten the downfall of the non-filter cigarets . " I do n't see how the non-filters and the filters can sell at the same price for very long , " one executive confides . " It is n't realistic pricing . " Prior to the increase , the filter tip brands generally sold for about a cent more than the king size lines and two cents more than the regular size . Sales Still on Rise Sales of cigarets still appear to be on the upswing . A report in March and another earlier this month linking cigaret smoking with lung cancer " have n't hurt our sales at all , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " are up from last year , " Mr. Galloway says . American Tobacco says its sales are " holding up well . " 0 . Parker McComas , president of Philip Morris , said recently his companys sales were running about 10% ahead of 1956 levels . Some of the sales increases can be attributed to the growth of the higher-priced filtered brands . The Internal Revenue Service , which mints the number of cigarets on which the manufacturers pay taxes rather than dollar volume , reports cigaret smoking for the first four months of this year was ahead of the like 1956 period . This figure could be swelled a bit by new brands coming into the market . Example : P. Lorillard Co. ' s Newport and Liggett It : Myers ' Oasis menthol-filter top brands are being rushed to retailers . It the better sales trend continues , it could he a record year for cigaret sales , topping the 394.1 billion cigarets consumed in 1952 . In 1953 and 1951 consumption of the smokes dropped off sharply when the reported cigaret-lung cancer link was first publicized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cigarets from domestic factories dipped to 386.8 billion units in 1953 and to 368.7 billion in 1954 . The uptrend began in 1955 , when 382.1 billion cigarets were smoked , and reached 391.6 billion last year .
