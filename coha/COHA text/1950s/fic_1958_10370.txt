had her on her feet now , and her doing up the bun at the back of her neck and calling for everybody to look on the floor for her hairpins . Some guys got down on their hands and knees and began to crawl around . And a couple of the boys got a hand under each of her elbows and pushed her over to the bar . She was limping . . . . Inky looked down : one foot was bare . He got off his stool and stepped back . The boys lifted her up on it , still by the elbows . She was a good-looking girl , Inky thought . A little too short , but a good figure . And the highest heaviest breasts he had ever seen . " I lost my shoe , " she was saying , still panting , " I lost my goddamnshoe . " " Give the lady a beer , " somebody said . " Pour it so there 's foam , " she said , " I like the foam . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then lifted her face , grinning . " Real cold ! " And she began to drink , so quickly that some spilled on her breasts . Inky found himself staring at them , wondering what sort of a bra she wore , and whether her skin would have little red crisscrossmarks from the stitching . Then he remembered what he was thinking , and turned away , tossed off the last swallow in his glass , and left . He noticed Julius sitting at a table just inside the door and grinning at him , as he left . He felt a little brittle the next morning . He did not work all day . He sent a kid over to the grocery for a sandwich at noon . He took a pillow up under the trees and one of the paper-back books he 'd bought nearly two months ago and had n't looked into . And in the heat of the day he 'd dozed off . He came flying out of his sleep , sitting straight up , and feeling that there was somebody staring at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even a cricket or a locust . So there had been somebody there , he knew . He got to his feet and looked around , but in the tangle of bushes and vines and wide palmetto leaves , he could see nothing . And after a minute or so the crickets began again.  |p201He  looked around for the hose  --  some men were scrubbing out the wheelhouse on one of the luggers tied down the wharf a way . And they had just started dragging the hose there . So he put on his trunks and walked across the island to the open surf side . The sand was a muddy color , but it was smooth as he waded out and there were no rocks . A hundred yards farther out two porpoises were playing , their shiny black backs rising , arching and disappearing . A game of tag , Inky thought . The sand dropped away . It seemed he had stepped over a ledge . And for a minute he went under the water , then he was treading , shaking his head to clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow crawl down the beach , trying to mimic the slow rolling motion of the porpoises . The water was very warm , he noticed . If you swam too hard , you could feel yourself begin to perspire . So he turned on his back and floated , trying to see if he could lift both his feet clear out at the same time . In a few minutes he was winded . Jesus , he thought , the damn cigarettes . So he headed in . This time for fun he swam as high up the beach as he could . His ankle hit something , and he turned to see . The little surf was too muddy . But he felt by the way the water moved that there was something beneath him . A porpoise , maybe , playing games with him  --  a few strong strokes sent him up on the sand . He was walking out hitching up his pants , when he noticed the tall thin man standing and watching him . " Water 's on the warm side , " Inky said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a man , Inky thought , just a boy . Very tall , very thin , with a long thin face and a heavy black beard that showed through shaving . " Why do n't you go try it ? " The boy shook his head . " Go swimming a couple times a year . " " Yea ? " " When I fall over . " The small pointed white teeth laughed . " I been seeing you down at the dock , " Inky said . " Name 's Inky , " the boy said . " I know . Mine 's Perique . " " I left my cigarettes back on the boat , " Inky said . " You got one ? " I " Do n't smoke , " Perique said . Though there was the shape of a half-full pack in his shirt pocket . Inky did n't look . " Wo n't kill me to wait . " " Not many people around here go swimming . " " Wonder why ? " Inky said . " Water 's good . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and you do n't want to go floating around in it on your day off . " They stood and watched the empty expanse of Gulf , bright blue . The porpoises were back ; there were three this time . " What 's that ? " Inky pointed to the flurry of white caps off the west end of the island . " Shallows . " " No pass there ? " Perique shook his head . " It makes it look pretty , all right , " Inky said . " All that white water off to one side . " High overhead , a hawk and a catbird were fighting and screaming . A couple of feathers floated down and settled in the surf . " Funny thing , " Inky said , " coming in just now , thought I kicked up against a rock . " " Did n't know there was a rock anywhere along this coast . " " Okay , " Inky said . On his wet body the sun was burning hot , and in the glare he could hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Timbers , I reckon . " " There ? " Perique nodded and scratched his upper lip . " Ship went ashore ? " " Charlotte L. " " Musta been a long time , " Inky said , " Sand 's most covered it . " " When it blows the right way sometime , " Perique said , " you can see the hull stick up . " " Took a blow to put her up there . " " Did , for sure . " " Kind I do n't mind missing , " Inky said . " Be seeing you . " He went back to the boat and began to fix supper . And hecut himself three extra slices of bread ; he was planning to dosome drinking that night.  |p203He  had switched to whisky . Lacy Livaudais just grinned . He had on a different cap , Inky noticed , a school beanie this time in dark green with the initials TU on the front . " You doing serious drinking tonight , beau , " he said . " It 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get a bottle , " he jerked his thumb over his shoulder at the rows of pints and fifths . " I 'm thinking it going to be cheaper for you . " " Okay , " Inky said , " and no charging for the water . " " What label you want ? " Inky squinted at the names . " No Scotches ? " " Sure . " The head turned so that Inky was staring at the thick white-scarred back of the neck . " There . " " Just one bottle ? " " Who going to drink Scotch ? " " Not me , " Inky said . " Gim me the P.M. " The room was noisier than the night before . It was the band : the piano and the accordion from yesterday , and a guitar , and a set of drums , and a violin . Inky found himself listening to the violin . " Jesus , " he mutteredunder his breath . There was n't a string that was tuned right . Sounds like that were enough to twist your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice . He was sipping away at the whisky , drinking it neat . He 'd always liked the blends better than the straights . It was a matter of what you got used to first ... . Even now when he was spending Arthur 's money . He slipped one finger over his wallet in his shirt pocket , a good fat wallet , fatter than he 'd ever had in his life ; all of it to take care of a boat , a narrow mean hull and some canvas overhead . Boat that had more care than most people , he thought . And he thought of Helen and the bottles of perfume that were still on the boat . She 'd left a heavy musky woman smell around the cabin for days . He closed his eyes and sniffed the whisky and tried to imagineher . Maybe it was the sharp smell of the whisky or maybe it was the noise in the room behind him , but he could n't seem to manage . I came real close to getting stuck on her , he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen , shut up in a boat with her like that . " God-damn bitch , " he said aloud . The bartender heard him and leaned over in his direction . " Who that ? " " Girl I used to know . " " Good looker ? " " Man , " Inky said , " you 'd dream about this one for a piece of strange . " The bartender chipped a sliver of ice and dropped it into Inky 's water . " Only she was fooling , " Inky said . " Huh ? " " She was n't all that fond of her husband . " " Never are , " the bartender said . " Hey , Petie , hey ! " somebody shouted in the room . " She was n't having anything to do , " Inky said , " not with anybody . " Man , she lay herself out on the deck , smearing oil all over herself . And you 'd see her put it on and rub it all over and turn around and take off her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back moved that she was rubbing it in her breasts  --  she 'd rub herself all over and squirm because it was so good . She did n't need a man nor anybody else . And Inky turned around and leaning back on the bar , began to watch the room . Julius was waving at him . Inky nodded back . Julius came up to him . " I been calling you . You gone deaf ? " " I did n't hear nothing . " " Sure I call you . I say : Petie , hey . ' " Julius stopped and began to grin . A little grin that began at the corner of his mouth and kept spreading until it turned into a laugh and he had to bend over and slap his knees . " That ai n't your name ! " " What ? " " Petie . " " No , " Inky said . A girl passed within arm reach . Julius patted her behind . She spun around . And glared at Inky for a minute . " Look , lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Julius chuckled . Her eyes swung over to him and hung stillp205for a minute . Then she began to giggle as she backed safely away . " How 'd you keep from getting your ears flattened ? " Julius waved his fat pink hands . " Me ? Nobody going to take old Julius serious . Not no young man , he ai n't going to get mad . " " I take you serious , " Inky said . " I would n't let you get in ten feet of any woman of mine . " The little hands folded together solemnly . And Julius pursed his lips . Inky worked away at his bottle steadily , not slugging himself all at once so that he would turn groggy . He was working himself into a beautiful glow . He had n't had a good drunk like this in months . " You getting a load there , man , " Hector said . " Do n't you worry about me , " Inky said . " Long as you ai n't a mean drunk . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Okay , " Hector said . Cecile came up and rubbed her chin on his shoulder . " How 's he making out ? " she asked Hector as if Inky were n't there . Inky said : " Ask me . " Those light-colored eyes of hers crinkled up in a grin . " How you doing ? " " Just great , " he said . " Just plain great . " " Yea , I can see . . . you sure you do n't want to dance ? " " How many times I got to tell everybody . . . " Okay , " Hector said . " If you do , " Cecile said , " there 's them around would n't find it any great trouble . " " Yea , " Inky said . " I noticed one eying me for size . " Cecile laughed , out loud . " He do n't need us , " she said . " AndI got to dance , me , " Cecile pulled at Hector 's arm . " Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inky went on drinking , carefully , building his glow . That one girl , the one he had noticed , kept finding excuses to walk back and forth in front of him , never looking at him , but always looking him over . Inky tried to catch her eye , but she was far too quick.  |p206She  was good-looking : dark hair , dark eyes , and dark olive skin . There 'd be Negro blood in her somewhere , Inky thought . She was wearing an orange dress  --  bright orange , the color of lifejackets  --  cutvery full , so that it was always moving around her , always swirling , as if she were just stepping out of it . One of the neon signs began flickering . Lacy Livaudais shook it , hard as he could . Steve , the other bartender , went over too , and tapped it with his fingernail . Nothing happened . So they both shrugged and forgot it . The uncertain light made Inky 's eyes twitch and burn . A tear went dripping down his left cheek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside , remembered and reached back for his bottle and took it along . It was a hot night , moonless , with stars so bright and low that you 'd think they were caught in the trees . It was still too , all you could hear was the high singing of mosquitoes and the little sucking sound of the surf , not fifteen feet away . The steps of the porch went down into the sand . It 'll go in a hurricane , Inky thought . But what about the whole island , he wondered . There was n't any height or real-looking substance to it . The wind and the Gulf together could lift it right off and scatter it all up and down the coast in a million billion pieces . But it had n't gone  --  and nobody remembered to count the hurricanes that had passed while people were living here . It made you dizzy , Inky thought , all the generations that had lived here and all the wind that had blown over them . . . . It was thoughts you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratched his head and half sat on the railing . Over in the far corner of the porch on a little wicker settee a couple was necking . They did not seem to notice him . The Gulf had turned black . Where 'd the porpoises go , the ones that he had seen playing in the afternoon . Maybe some bigger fish was chasing them . He tried to remember . Maybe a barracuda . The screen door opened behind him , but he did not bother . " Man , you are a foxy one , " a woman 's voice said , " do n't even leave his bottle out on the bar while he 's gone . " The words and the voice registered slowly . When he looked there was only the back of the bright orange dress.  |p207Son  of a bitch , he told himself . And went back inside to the bar . His glass was still there . And standing next to it was the tall thin boy he had met on the beach . Inky said : " You know anything that eats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared . " Nothing , " Inky said and felt his ears go hot , " I was just talk-ing . " " What eats what ? " The ice was melted . Inky leaned across the bar . " I need some of this , might need a chaser . " And to Perique he said : " I was just talking crazy . Forget it . " " Sure , " Perique said . There was a girl with him too , Inky had noticed her trim form . And now he noticed her face , and shook his head and looked again . " I sure do keep running into you . " Annie said : " You look like you having a good time . " " Come on , " Perique said , " have a dance with me . " " Quit ordering me around , " Annie snapped . " I did n't come with you . " " Who 'd you come with ? " Inky asked . " Nobody , " she said , " I 'm big enough to find my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bottle . " I guess you can if you want to . " She turned away from him , abruptly . " Let 's try one , " she said to Perique . The girl in orange kept crossing back and forth . She was alone too . Or at least , she was never alone . But she was never long with any one man . The dress was cut low in back . You could see the two little points of her shoulder blades . Inky finished his bottle . Lacy asked : " You want another ? " " Hell , " Inky said , " I do n't want to pass out . " " You got work to do yet tonight ? " He scratched his bald skull through the felt cap . " Maybe , " Inky said . A big brown hard-shelled beetle bumbled into his shirt and hung there . Inky flicked it down to the floor.  | " Hey , " Lacy said , " do n't step on that . It 's a stink bug . " " Get me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He shook his head . " Man , you losing ground , " Lacy said . The girl passed back again . Her legs were a little too thin . She was getting rid of her dancing partner . " I got to get home , " she was telling him . " I got to sleep some-time . " He was tugging at her arm , a thin wiry fellow . " C'm on , no ? Best dancer in the place . " She pulled away . " Where I leave my purse ? " It was down at the far end of the bar . As she headed to it , Inky tossed off his drink and ducked out the door . He moved into the dark clump of little trees to the left of the building . Then he squatted down on the ground to rest . His head was singing , just a little . She came out , finally , brushing back her hair with one hand . She came down the steps , and then stopped and took off her shoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding them one in each hand . Inky got to his feet very slowly . " I 'm coming , " she said , " do n't hurry me ! " How can she see me , Inky thought , unless she 's got eyes like a cat . But he stepped out and touched her arm . She jumped back , gasping . Inky stood looking after her , trying to understand , shaking his head slowly . " Wha 's the matter , " he asked her . " Wha 's the matter ? " She took a couple more steps back until she brushed against a hackberry . The swirling skirts caught up on the heavy thorns . Inky still had n't moved . Something was wrong . And he was trying to understand , drunkenly . And then he noticed the other shadow , just down the path a little . Or maybe he heard the very faint click of the switch-blade knife . He was too drunk . And fighting with a knife was n't one of the things he wanted to do sober . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress was keeping very still . You could hear her heavy breathing . You could tell she loved a fight.  |p209Inky  tried to stop his head swinging , tried to hold it still so he could see better . He used both hands finally , propped them one on each side of his chin . The man had taken a step out into the white crushed-shellpath . You could n't see the knife , but he 'd be holding it low . The woman began carefully pulling her dress off the thorns . " Jesus , " Inky said softly . " Who you looking for ? " the shadow said . Inky rubbed at his eyes , and shuffled his feet on the ground , trying to be sure of his balance . For a second the red neon of the beer signs caught and reflected something . Button , Inky told himself . Or the blade . He rubbed furiously at his eyes , trying to clear his head . He moved his shoulders : they felt stiff . The woman still had n't got her dress free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was working gently at each one . Calmly , as if she 'd been out for a walk on a Saturday noonday . " Son of a bitch , " Inky whispered . The man came out into the center of the path . A step or two closer . He was n't hurrying , but he was coming . And then there was somebody calling him . " Inky . . . Inky ... " A soft little call . " Inky . . . " For a second he was not sure . He cocked his head , listening . When the girl turned up at his side , he did not recognize her in the dark . " I been looking for you , " she said . He opened his mouth to answer and then closed it again . She glanced up the path , as if seeing for the first time . " George ? " " What you come busting in for ? " " Whose busting ? " She giggled . " I got as much right here as you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet my date , no ? " " What you coming here for ? " She just giggled . Inky went back to rubbing his eyes . " Everybody real loaded , " she said . And she slipped her arm into Inky 's . " So dark you ca n't see much . . . . She turned him around , and they crossed in front of the Rendezvousand began to walk up the beach . " Let 's go over to my porch , " she said loudly . They felt the other eyes following them down the beach . Inky stumbled in the sand . The girl laughed . " You real drunk . ... "  |p210They  walked down the beach , almost half a mile . Inky felt the soft sound of the surf in one ear , and in the other the soft murmuring sound of the land life . They turned inland . " This whole island 's full of the god-damn paths . " " Sort of , " she said . They crossed under some twisted oak trees and were starting across a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " now wait a minute . " There was some kind of small flower underfoot . You could see them faintly in the dark . " Wait a minute , " he said . And he squinted at her face . " Be god damned , " he said . " Annie . " " Let 's go , " she said . " Thanks , kid . " He would not move . " That was a real fine job . " " You know the way back to the boat ? " " Which boat ? " " Yours . " " Thought you said we were heading for your house . " She giggled nervously . " I was just talking , " she gestured , " for them . " " Why not ? " " Well , " she said , and paused for a minute , " my papa would n't like that . " " He 's got a new wife , " Inky said , " he wo n't notice . " You could feel her stiffen in the dark as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . He stumbled after her . " Sorry , honey , " he said . " I 'm drunk or I would n't say that . " She stopped but did n't answer . " Show me the way back to the boat , " he said.  |p211HI  S arm through hers was heavy and sometimes it seemed she was dragging him along . Now and then she had to stop for breath . He did n't say a word the whole time . Once she said : " Watch where you step . " And he did n't even seem to hear her . They passed the Arcenaux store where a little light was still burning by the back door . Philomene always left that for Julius so he would n't trip when he came in . Annie looked at the light when they went plodding past , the little glow behind the drawn shade . Philomene , now , Annie thought , she was a patient wife . What did they have to say , she wondered , on the nights when Julius stayed home . Inky tripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Pick up your feet . " They came to the wharf and there was the bay black and still with little points of stars reflecting , and the outlines of the luggers . And one tall mast . " Come on , " Annie said , " we 're almost there . " Their feet were like hammers on the boards . They must be waking everybody on this side of the island , Annie thought , and she tried to move slower . A couple of cats , who had been prowling around on a lugger , jumped over the side and scooted away between their legs . " What the hell was that ? " Inky said . " Nothing . Cats . " If he fell in , Annie thought , what would happen ? And she held on to his arm a little tighter . We 'd both drown . . . she thought . He would n't let go , and we 'd both drown and in the morning , they 'd find us , and they wonder what we were doing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a couple of drinks too , and the whole211p212world was shimmering and sad , she began to cry . Not sob , but cry . The tears were pouring down her face . Then , quick as they began , they stopped . " Can you get aboard ? " He stepped slowly and carefully over the lifelines . " Ca n't go falling in the water . " He 'd been thinking that too . Or maybe he could tell what she was thinking . ... " No , " she said . She followed him on the deck . " Can you manage ? " He sat down for a moment on the carriage roof . " Do n't worry , honey , I made it a lot drunker than this . " " I 'll go light the lamp . " The matches were by the stove , and the lamp right above . The light and the recent tears hurt her eyes and she stepped back . It was just a little pool of light  --  just a kerosene lamp  --  and she could stand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " she said . He swung himself down the hatch , not bothering with the little ladder . " You did that the hard way . " " Never bother with ladders , honey , " he said ; " they really trip you . " He was leaning against the little icebox and fingering it as if he had never seen it before . Suddenly he tapped it sharply . " Let 's have a drink . " " I had enough , " Annie said . He did n't seem to hear . He got two paper cups from a holder on the wall , found a bottle in one of the cabinets and poured a couple of drinks . " Even got ice . " He got a couple of cubes and dropped them in . " We so fucking fancy , " he said and hesitated , looking around . " How come ? " He pointed unsteadily to the lamp . " We got elec-tricity . " " Did n't know where the mainswitch was , " she admitted . " Knew I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Smart girl , smart like a schoolteacher . . . " " This is lots of light , " Annie said . " Sure . . . but it 's there , right there , under the ladder , see ? " " It 's a nice boat , " Annie said , " but I got to go home . " She wanted to leave , but the passageway was narrow and hep213was standing in the middle . She could have pushed by , he did n't seem in any mood to stop her , but all of a sudden she did n't want to touch him . " Sit down , " he said . There were two bunks , one on each side . She hesitated for just a minute . She felt strange sitting on a bed . . . . There 's nowhere else , she told herself . He handed her the cup , and then sat down on the opposite bunk . She felt relieved , and , way down , a little disappointed . He did not say anything . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water against the hull . And a couple of night birds . The lamp smoked for an instant , then cleared . The cubes of ice bumped against the paper cup she held in her hand . And the silence bothered her . She could feel herself breathing it in . Almost like being under water , and drowning . She said , because she had to find something to say : " You really been drinking . " And then she was sorry , and wondered if he was going to be offended . He was slow in answering and she tried to think of an apology . " I been drunker , " he said . " Nearly got yourself cut up . " She sipped and looked at him over the rim of the cup . " Son of a bitch , " he said softly . She watched him , sitting under the kerosene lamp , the yellow light making a kind of halo " Tell me about your boyfriends , " he said suddenly . She frowned . And had a little flutter of panic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about the rest of it . " " I ca n't do that , " Annie said . " Answer my questions ? " " Maybe . " " Start with that tall thin fellow , the one tonight . " " Perique ? " " Yea . " She laughed and her fear relaxed a little . " Oh , him . . . " He 's your boyfriend ? "  | " In a way . " She felt better now , now that she 'd had time to think . She could remember now and tell him , tell him carefully so that there would n't be any contradictions . She had thought it all out , long ago , all about the different ones who had been her lovers . She could close her eyes now and see some of them , she had imagined them so clearly . She could remember how they had kissed her even . . . but that was as far as she could feel . Even her daydreams had ended here . Had left her irritated . " What way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Inky said . " Do n't be a sneaky little bitch . " " Well , " she said and stared up at the carefully polished beams of the ceiling , " I did n't go to bed with him . " She watched Inky carefully . Her answer had surprised him . His face showed it . She felt better , more confident . " He 's a nice boy , " she said , " but I just did n't feel that way about him . " " You got to feel that way ? " She said : " Do n't you ? " " Sometimes , " he said . " And sometimes not ? " " Finish your drink , " he said . " Do n't make me waste it . " She took another small sip . " Too strong ? " " Hell no , " she said . " Where 'd you learn words like that ? " " Nowhere . " It was hot in the cabin . She wondered how he could sleep here . " In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would live in this cabin , not the forward one  --  she was almost sure of that . But there was n't a sign of him anywhere  --  not a jacket nor a cap , not a paper nor a book . The cabin was clear and spotless , like a picture advertisement for a boat . " Tell me what it was like , in the convent . " " Sort of dull , " she said . " How many of the sisters made passes at you ? " " Well . . . " she did not quite understand . She was afraid to say yes and she did not want to admit a no.  |p215Then  she understood . " No , " she said quickly . " Course not . " She began to wish she had stayed home , that she 'd stayed home and not started the evening at all . Whenever she looked back now , she 'd have to remember the unpleasantness . It was this business of remembering that annoyed her . The evening had changed and there was a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt your feelings , " Inky said , " I was just asking about what I 'd heard . " " You know some funny people , " she said . She sounded peevish though she had n't meant to , and she was sorry . " Forget it , " Inky said . The first thing she knew she was crying was the little splash of a tear on her hand . She looked at it in surprise . " What sort of night is it ? " She went and looked out the hatch , and wiped her eyes while her back was turned . " Come on , " he said . " Tell me more about your boyfriends . " " Well , " she said . And she turned her memory back on the big gray stone building , with its stained-glass windows in the long halls , and the little red glasses of vigil lights in all the corners , and the smell of furniture polish so strong in closed rooms you could hardly breathe . And Beatriz , lovely and old for her age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft wiggle of her behind that no amount of nuns ' scoldings could change . Beatriz , with her heavy-lashed eyes , that she mascaraed secretly every morning . " No , " she said , " it was n't me . " But the more she thought the more she remembered : the dark wine-red color of Beatriz 's robe gliding down the black linoleumflooredhall . And the ring Beatriz had pinned to her bra . And the lights of the car flickering through the leaves and the trunks for just a second before they switched off . And looking back , she was Beatriz . She could feel her lips form the characteristic half-smile , sleepy and alert all at once . And when she turned away from the open hatch , she had the slow walk and the soft little wiggle . " I do n't want to talk about it , " Annie said and her voice had taken on a very faint accent . " Why not ? "  |p216She  sat down on the bunk and her fingers touched the left bra strap , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " and I do n't want to remember it . " She felt so confident now . " What happened ? " Inky frowned in the effort to see her more clearly . " He go off with somebody else ? " " Please . . .. " She hissed her s 's just slightly and looked away in disgust . " Why did n't you keep him ? " " There are some things  --  " she hesitated just a little , " beyond help . " That sounded good so she repeated the phrase : " Beyond help . " " Why ? " He was pouring himself another drink . " He leave town or something ? " She was fingering the little clasp on the strap ; it could have been a ring . " He left  --  in a way . " " You sound like he died . " She was a little surprised : the idea had not occurred to her . She stood up and peered out the little porthole , and she lifted her chin the way Beatriz would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killed in a car crash . She was crying now , really meaning it now . But still she held her chin up . The tears were very warm on her face and she could feel them spreading out , spreading out , until her whole body was warm and tingling . She was so busy with her make-believe grief that she did not notice Inky until he came and sat beside her . She jumped  --  just a little . She could n't help that . " Have a drink , " he said . She shook her head , but he took her cup and filled it . " Look , " he said , " you got troubles , I got troubles . Nothing so different in that . " She hardly heard him . She was thinking clearly  --  so clearly that it seemed like she was talking out loud  --  If I 'm going , I have to go now . And if I stay , I ca n't cry tomorrow . Because I 'm sober enough now . And I could go up that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : going up the ladder step by step . She could feel that hard surface under the balls of her feet . Then the deck , then the wharf boards. rp217She stared down at the brownish-yellow mixture in her cup . " That looks strong , " she said , and leaned back . Inky 's : arm was across the back cushions . And her neck rested on it at an uncomfortable angle , but she did not move . It would look too funny , she thought . " Want some music ? " " You get anything this late ? " " All-night station in New Orleans . " " Where 's the radio ? " " There . " He pointed to her left . " Okay . " He reached his right arm across her . " Ca n't make it , " he said . " Got to move . " His arm brushed across her throat . " Lemme get one swallow first , " she said , forcing herself to sound calm . His arm stayed where it was . " Move , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat up . He leaned behind her this time and turned on the radio . She could feel the heat of his body and she wondered how anybody could sleep down in the cabin . She asked him : " How can you sleep down here ? " He straightened himself up . " Sleep on deck , " he said . The radio was on , very softly . Annie cocked her head listening . " I 'm real glad to know about that station . " " Nice in a car at night . " She sipped at her cup , not quite sure what to say . " Drink up . " She hesitated . " Wo n't hurt you . " She swallowed quickly , shivering a little as the liquid burned down her throat and chest . He grinned . " Feel that ? " " Right here . " She put a finger to her chest . He put a hand on top of hers . " There , huh ? " She nodded . " Rubbing helps . " He began to massage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her chest , rubbing fairly hard so that she squirmed a little as the bra straps cut her shoulders . " Quit , " she said . He got up and fixed her another drink without a word . She stood up too , shaking out her skirt.  | " One thing been bothering me , " he said . " What ? " There was a stubborn crease in the skirt ; she tried to pull it out between her fingers . " Story about the guy in New Orleans  --  that true ? " " Sure it is , " she said . " You been to bed with a man , huh ? " She gave a little snickering laugh , more from embarrassment than anything else . And turned to look at the papers on the little hanging table . There were a couple of pens and a bottle of India ink and some water colors there . " You been drawing ? " He did not answer . She shuffled the papers . For a minute in the dim light , she did not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with great care  --  a naked woman , lying on her back , her legs open . " Got a better one , " Inky said , and hunted until he found it : a nude sleeping on the sands of some beach , her sun hat over her face . " Oh , " Annie said . " They bother you ? " " No , " Annie said . And that was the truth . She was surprised , and she was startled by the beauty of the women 's bodies . Do yousuppose , she asked herself , I 'll look like that someday ? " I get five bucks or so for these , " Inky said , " in New Orleans . " " You do ? " " Sure , " he said , " They color ' em up for the tourists . " " Oh . " She took the drink from his hand and went back to the couch . The radio was still playing . " Pick up a lot extra money that way . " She put her nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did n't know you could draw . " " Sort of , " he said . " Want me to do one of you ? " " Like that ? " " Sure , " he said , " I was n't ever very good with faces , never could get a likeness . " She shook her head . " Why not ? " he said . " I bet you got a cute shape . " She buried herself in the cup , blushing with the compliment . Her ears were singing now , very steadily . " No , " she said.  | " Okay , " he said . " It 's a shame . " She was a little groggy and very hot . " I do n't see how you can take it down here , " she said . " I 'm burning up . " " Slip off the dress , " he said . " It 's too pretty to get it sweaty and wet . " She was thinking that over when his fingers were quickly openingthe buttons of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , he had the blouse thrown back and the soft fingers were dragging the bra down . " No , " she said uncertainly . " Listen to the radio , " Inky said , " and finish your drink . " The fingers fastened themselves to her nipple , coaxingly . " Look , " he said , " why did n't you tell me , for Chrissake ? " " What , " she said , " what ? " " I ask you . " " What ? " " If you 'd been to bed with a man before . " " I was . " " Oh sure , " he said , " oh sure . . . . Look at the cushion . " " I 'll clean it . " " God damn , " Inky said thickly . " I did n't want anything to do with a god-damn virgin . " Even through the whisky she could feel that hurt . " It gets light early , " Inky said . She was barely listening . The whisky had worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll feel god awful tomorrow , she thought . And then , surprised , she had to add , tomorrow is here now . " Know what time it is ? " She shook her head . " Just about four-thirty . " " You do n't have a clock . " " There . " He turned her head , so that she saw the little green luminous numbers . " See . " She yawned deeply . " Do n't you think you better get home ? " She was so tired she could hardly hold her head up.  | " You do n't want people to see , do you ? " She kept thinking , tomorrow is here now . " C'on , honey . I 'll walk you home . " The gulls were beginning to scream . It must be near morning . She wanted so badly to go to sleep . His hand on her arm urged her up the ladder . On the deck she stopped : the little fresh air made her feel better . " Give me the comb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shirt pocket . " It 's clean , all right . " She jerked it through her hair quickly . " That 'll do . " Did he kiss her good-by , she wondered . And was too unsure to look at his face to see . Or maybe she was supposed to do something . She tried to think but her thoughts kept scattering like water drops . There was something . . . something .. . " Do n't fall , " he said when she swung over to the dock . " Water might feel good , " she had a tired little smile . She tried to put the faint little accent back in her words , but somehow she could n't manage it . " Can you make it ? " She took a couple of sharp breaths . Her body ached all over . Standing up brought a pain to the pit of her stomach , a pain she had n't noticed before . " I 'll walk you home . " " No , " she said . " You stay here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find you way back in the dark . And maybe George got a real drunk on  --  wait for him to sober up before you run into him . " There was something that should be done . There was something that needed to be done . And now knowing , she began to feel restless and embarrassed . " Ca n't let you do that , " Inky said and he scratched his close-cut brown hair . " Oh hell , " Annie said . Her head felt clearer . She wanted to stay and she wanted to leave . " I can take care of myself . " " Do n't be mad , " Inky said . " Who 's mad ? " She was n't . She swore she was n't . She tried to remember Beatriz , tried to imagine herself Beatriz again . She closedp221her eyes to try . She would have the image for a minute , but then it would fall to pieces . " I just did n't want people seeing you here . " " I can take care of myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick . She wanted to go home . " I do n't know , " Inky said doubtfully and scratched his ear . " You 'll just get lost , " she said , and she had already turned away with the nasty taste of confusion in her mouth . " Me , I 'm used to it . " She moved off down the pier , stepping carefully on the rickety boards . Inky watched her out of sight , but she did not once turn or wave . As she got to the end of the wharf and turned off it to the path , she noticed somebody sitting quietly on the big rusty windlassthat had been abandoned there years ago . Somebody waiting , out of sight of the Pixie . She noticed without any emotion at all that the sitting figure was Perique . She passed within five feet of him . For a minute or so she wondered whether he was going to take a knife or his fists to her  --  if he were drunk , he might . He sat with his feet tucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was not asleep , she was sure of that , but he did n't move at all when she passed him . The dogs were barking down at the western end of the island . From the sound they 'd have something treed . The barking always sounded muffled at night , she thought . Against the uneven shells of the path , her shoes slipped and jogged . If I take them off , she thought . But her fingers , hanging down from her hands , felt stiff and heavy . So she did n't bother . I 'm moving hard , she thought , but I 'm not moving fast . From a chinaberry tree an owl stared down at her , and then flapped silently away . Evil eye , she thought , that 's what they used to say . Owl looks at you , devil looks at you . She crossed herself with a small vague movement . You were n't supposed to kill an owl . They said if you did ,  |p222you  'd be killing your three-times great-grandmother . Boys did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fell to laughing and joking about it , they had a different and a scared tone . A cricket now . . . that was the same sort of thing . He was your three-times great-grandfather , they said . If a cricket got in the house you were n't supposed to kill it , the way you did roaches and ants . You chased it out , but not with the broom , with the feather duster . There were crickets all around now , singing . They 'd hush when she passed , and then take up again when she 'd gone . It was like she was moving in a well of silence , carrying it with her . And if a cricket got to singing in the house . . . and if a cricket sang in the house during the night , that was a death . Before her mother had died , had n't she woke up one night to find a cricket sitting in the corner of the room , singing . And had n't her screaming gotten the whole house up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , shiny black , like the limousines at funerals in New Orleans . And when you looked at them close , at their nubby head and their bone-thin bodies , they were the shape of death too . There 'd be a time when one would come and sit in the corner of her bedroom , and wake her at night with his singing , his coming , his singing for her . Her thighs hurt so , and the bottom of her stomach . She pressed both hands to it as she walked along . Her head was hurting now and her eyes felt dry and burned . There was a little breeze had come up , a little warm breeze that was off the swamps to the north . You could smell the swamps in it : the heavy sweet-sour rotting . A rooster gave a sharp loud crow . The breeze would drop soon , and it would be so still that the mosquitoes would come in clouds . And first there 'd be a greenish sky and then the sun would come up , white and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the sky . But it was still all dark , except for the stars and the pale old moon that was just beginning to rise . She passed her own gate . She had to turn and go back to it . She had trouble with the latch . Her fingers did n't seem to bep223strong enough to pry it open . The big black dog her father had trained to be a hunter came out from under the house , growling . " Sh . . . . " she whispered . The dog flattened , his head stretched out , fawning . She patted him . " Sisss . . . . I 'm sneaking home , she told herself . Like I was still in the convent . . .. " There 's nobody here to mind , " she told the dog aloud . At her words all the crickets for a hundred yards around stopped suddenly , and the dark got thick and silent . She could almost feel them  --  and all the other creatures that lived in the brush  --  staring at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She patted the dog again . And she began to feel fear tickle up her scalp . She turned and hurried into the house , tripping on the top step and falling full length on the porch . She was in the front hall and hobbling down its length to her room when she remembered that she had lost one shoe . And went back to get it . The black dog came in with her , squeezed in between her legs . She heard him pad into the living-room and wheeze with contentmentas he stretched out on the sofa . " You 'll catch it in the morning , " she told him aloud . " He beat the hide off you . " The hall was dark too , and she tripped again on the little piece of rug in front of her door . But she got inside and stretched out on the bed , in her clothes , watching the ceiling go past like a merry-go-round . After a while , when the sky was beginning to lighten and the chickens were stirring around in the yard under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her head . She ached . She ached all over , and she was nauseated . Her stomach hurt , like there was something inside moving , tearing her . She was terribly hot , and she was too tired to take off her slip . She lay very still and felt the sweat run down the curve of her body . She wanted to cry , but she could n't . Her eyes were dry and wide . It was broad daylight  --  and had been light for several hours  --  before they sagged closed.  |p224THAT  Sunday started the way the fourth Sunday in the month alwaysstarted . Jack Roualt ( it was his turn ) got up at six o'clock , shook the hangover out of his head with cold water and a whole pot of coffee , and started out in his little boat  --  the half-cabin fifteen-footer  --  to get the priest . He got there a good two hours before the priest was ready to leave . And he spent the time walking up and down the street , watching the girls as they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , leaning on the rail outside the church . ( It had once been a hitching-rail . ) Around ten o'clock the priest was ready , and they headed off top speed for the island . The priest was going to hear confessions before Mass , say Mass quick as he decently could , and go hurrying back for his late , and warmed-over , dinner at the rectory . And just about that time too , Eddie and Mike Livaudais dropped into their beds for a couple hours ' sleep before they went on with the hunt . That particular Sunday , no different . Except , maybe , that people got up later than usual , feeling brittle from the alcohol . None of the boats went out working . And the kids played in whispers around the houses or went off to the west end.  |p225It  was a little after ten when Al and Adele Landry finished breakfast . One corner of the kitchen was stacked with grocery boxes full of her stuff  --  she had not had time to unpack that . But there were new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other house  --  and her china was on the table . Not bad , she told herself , for two days . They were quiet , breathing into the hot thick silence of the morning . Adele could almost feel her mind running from one job to the other , deciding what to do and which to do first . And coming always back to the thing that was bothering her . Finally she said it aloud : " It 's not like you knew where she was . " " Who ? " Al asked sleepily . " Annie . " Al stretched and yawned and kicked the table so that the coffee cups rattled and the brown liquid sloshed into the saucer . " You did n't hear her , " Adele said , " this morning ? " " Maybe , " Al reached out and patted his wife 's hand , " maybe . " Adele looked worried . Her heavy brown eyebrows were crinkled . " And that means she was with some man , for sure . " Al nodded . " My girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clucked her tongue . " She is a nice girl . But she is too pretty for that . " " Never too pretty . " Adele spread her hands out on the oilcloth . " Look now , " she said . " Me , I can be a little careless where I go . I am not so young anymore . And I am never pretty . " " You out of you god-damn mind . " " No . " She shook her head . " I know this for a long time , and it does not bother me . " Al tilted his chair back and stared at her , at the smooth clean lines of the brown hair pulled back from her face into a roll . " Face like a ' tit ange ... " She got up and , taking the frying-pan off the stove , put it in the dishpan . " I am worried about it . " " I can tell , me , " he grinned . " You just went and put the pan full of grease in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are worried , for sure . "  |p226She  dipped the pan back in so hard that suds sloshed over the edge of the sink . " When her own father does not worry . . . She stopped and began to scrub out the grease . Al took a little crayola-shaped cylinder off one of the shelves , went over to the big mirror by the sink , and began to wax the tips of his mustache . " And we going to fight so soon . . . . " Her voice was a little unsteady . " Who fighting ? " he asked . " I ai n't . " She did n't answer . He put the cover on his tube of wax and put it back on the shelf . Then he came over and patted her behind . " Look , che ' , " he said , " what I can do to stop her ? " She did not answer . She hung up the pan . " See , " he said , " you ca n't think of nothing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can think of anything to stop the kids from doing what they bound to do . " " Wo n't do her no good , " Adele said . " Maybe , " Al said , " maybe not . Nothing to do about it . Like the hurricane , no ? Nothing to do . " Adele went to church . She left the minute the bell began to ring , and that was the minute the priest stepped off the boat . Al turned on the living-room radio loud and took a rockingchairout on the porch . There was a baseball game coming from New Orleans and he did n't want to miss it . Adele did not go to confession . She could n't think of anything that she had done , anything that might be a mortal sin . And she never went to confession just for venial sins , though a priest had told her once it was a good idea . After all these years she was still afraid of going into that little black box with its musty velvet curtains , and the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to church . Back home she went to High Mass every Sunday . . . . The priest came only once a month and there was never a High Mass on the island , Al said . The priest did n't bother ; there were n't any trained altar boys , and there was n't a choir . Maybe , she thought , on Christmas Eve or All Saints ' Day or Easter , Al will get the boat and take me over to Port Ronquille . . . . The incense and the singing , and the organ roaring so that herp227ears tingled  --  she always sat way back in the church , under the organ loft , so that she could hear the loudest . She would carry the sound in her head for hours after . The island church was small and white painted . And in black letters over the front door the words Mars Stella  --  there was more to the inscription but it had washed away because nobody bothered repainting more than the two words . The church was set up on the same high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickens and a nanny goat were grazing . The bell was hung from a ten-foot scaffolding built just to the right of the front door . The steps of the church at Port Ronquille were always crowded just before Mass  --  people gossiping , people getting a last cigarette before it was time to go inside . Here there was just a stray dog sleeping in the shade of a jasmine bush . Inside the confessional was empty : she hesitated a moment by the dusty curtain . The church was nearly empty too . Up in the front row , strung out like black beads on a thread , were four black-starved women . Old women , from their hunched shoulders . Adele sat down in the second to last pew . A small boy came in the sanctuary , a lighted candle in each hand . He put both on the altar , made a little ducking bow and disappeared . Up in the front row wood rosaries clattered on the seats . And one of the old women began to whisper to the other , in a highpitchedhissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great long steps that swirled his cassock and shook the whole building . One of the candles went out . He lit it impatiently from the second . Then he sighed and began , pausing only a breath for the responses no one was there to make . Adele could not follow him in the missal . His words were not clear enough for her to understand . She closed the book and put it on the seat behind her . And watched . He had just whirled to the right side of the altar and began what she knew must be the epistle , when the crowd of people came in . They scurried up the center aisle and stumbled into the pews : women , all women , Adele noticed , and children . Only some half-grown boys . And not a single man . Adele folded her hands and turned her eyes back to the altar.  |p228The  second candle had gone out again . But the priest did not seem to notice or mind anymore . Why did there have to be candles , she wondered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big weddings and funerals and big holy days . When she got married the first time , there 'd been whole lines of candles on the altar and a priest in white , white satin vestments with little tracings of gold thread . She had been close enough to notice that . It was hard for her to remember now what Bob Reynal looked like . And it was n't that long , she reminded herself . She felt a twinge ; maybe she should have . She shook her head , very slowly , to herself : she did n't and that was all there was to it . A year after he died , she had slipped the wedding-ring off her finger  --  because she was afraid of losing it , she told people  --  and had rarely put it back . She lived very quietly , and she was no more lonesome than she had been before he 'd appeared . The house , the pension , the boy Claudie  --  she should have rememberedhim better . But the house looked just like a dozen others in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a government check ; and the boy was her image and nobody else 's . He was gone , clean gone , the way chalk is when a blackboard 's been wiped with water . When she thought about it , looked at it that way , she had a funny feeling . She was almost angry with him . He had cheated her . He had not made her miss him . He was just gone . And he had taken his memory with him . She got to her feet for the Gospel . Some of the people around her stood , leaning against the pew in front of them . Most did not move . For a minute she was uncertain . But of course not , she told herself . If there was one thing she knew , it was what to do at Mass . She 'd expected a sermon : she rather liked them . But the priest just whirled around and with a Dominus vobiscum went on to the Creed . She sighed very lightly . And went back to her own thoughts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she crossed herself quickly  --  she would miss him.  |p229Nothing  will happen to him , she promised herself . He was just one year older . It 'll be me die first , she thought . A couple of pews in front of her there was a boy Claudie 's age . She found herself watching him . Looked like a nice boy . Was the water on the island good , she wondered . Back in Port Ronquille people said the water was bad . But most of the kids around looked healthy . . . . And would they play with Claudie , when they got used to him ? They were n't now , for sure . And it almost broke her heart yesterdayto see him stand in the front yard or on the porch and watch the kids go past , busy at something , with never so much as a glance at him . " They get used to him , " Al told her when she asked him . " Let ' em alone . Kids like to go slow . " And he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of misery . " It was hard to tell about the boy , she thought , but he seemed happy . And he had taken such a great liking to his stepsister . One evening over in Port Ronquille , when Al was visiting her , she 'd asked about his daughter , was she pretty . And Al had looked surprised and said no . But maybe Annie had changed in the year she was away . Or maybe her father just did n't notice . Adele remembered the stumbling steps she had heard in the hall early this morning . That was natural enough . For a pretty girl . She herself had never done anything like that : she 'd never had more than three drinks at any time in her life . And she had never come home just before daylight on a Sunday morning . But then , Adele thought , you had to be fair . Nobody had ever asked her . She went to the dances at Port Ronquille sometimes when she was a girl . There were always men to dance with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet and shy and  --  even in her thought she hesitated at the word  --  not a bit pretty . There never was anyone hanging around , feeding her drinks , trying to go to bed with her . " I got to be fair , " she whispered to herself . " I ca n't take it out on her . " And maybe too , as Annie got a little older , she 'd get prettier . And there 'd be more men . What was that like , Adele wondered , having all those eyes on you . . . . She ought to have been sorry that she 'd missed that.  |p230But  she was n't . She was still shy . And who was it last night , she thought . Maybe that tall , terribly thin boy  --  what was his name  --  Perique . She blinked and shifted her eyes back to the altar . The last Gospel . . . so soon . . . she stood up . And then the prayers ... for the Intentions of the Holy Father , for Peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the preceding one . The priest was in a hurry . Everything will turn out all right , she told herself . Only a crazy fool worries like me . Just the same maybe a special prayer . . . . And she tried to think of the proper saint . . . St. Ursula maybe , a young girl too . And Annie had stopped with the Ursulines in New Orleans . But the Mass was over and the people were filing out . And she did not like to stay kneeling while they passed and looked at her . She knocked over the little prayer bench in her haste . Even at that she was among the last . Everybody was going home , even hurrying a little in the heat . Everybody except a group standing over by the bell . They had not been in the church , she was sure of that , but now they seemed to be waiting for something . For the instant she stood above them , on the top step , she noticed that they were not wearing hats  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hair was combed and shining . It was a struggle to keep herself from staring at them as she walked slowly past . She was even afraid to look hard enough to see if she knew them . . . nobody else gave any sign of noticing them . She did see that they were dressed up . In the hot sun she could smell the clean cotton as she passed by . And even with downcasteyes she could see the sharp fresh creases in their pants . She would have asked . . . but there was no one . People bowed to her and smiled , but not one of them stopped to talk . Because there was nothing else to do , she walked home.  |p231THEY  were all Livaudais men  --  there was Eddie and his son Pete , and his brothers Mike and Phil , and Phil 's three sons ; and there were relatives by marriage : Chep Songy and his son Jerry , and Ray Songy too , both of them brothers of Belle Livaudais . There were ten of them that Sunday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited until the church was empty , then they went around to the sacristy door . The priest was just coming out , in his hand his little black doctor 's bag . His face was red with perspiration , and he had taken off his stiff Roman collar . " A scorcher , " he said gaily . The men did not smile . Eddie Livaudais cleared his throat , " Father , " he said , " we got business with you . " " On a day like this , " Stanislaus Ryan grinned , " nobody should have any business , except sitting down . " " We got business , " Eddie repeated . " And it is so pressing as all that ? " Eddie nodded . " Well then , man , " Father Ryan said briskly , " we 'll talk about it walking down to the boat . " They started off then . Eddie and the priest walking ahead , the others following two by two . Pete came last . He walked slowest , and every now and then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women on the path , who stepped aside to let them pass . Even the kids stopped playing to stare after them . " And this must be a very serious matter , " Father Ryan said . Eddie nodded . And from behind Mike said : " Serious for sure . " The priest did not interrupt his brisk pace . " And everyone seems to know about it . " " People come to find out , " Phil said . " And there is something I can help ? " " In a way , " Eddie said slowly.  | " If you do n't tell me I 'll never find out . " " I 'm trying to , " Eddie said , " only my mind do n't work so fast when I got to walk too . " The priest stopped dead in his tracks . In the close ranks behind , the men scuffed toes , bumped into each other and stopped . " Now tell me . " Eddie took a deep breath . " I got two boys . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The priest turned around . " And where is he ? " The other men stepped aside to the edges of the path , and Pete Livaudais was hustled up through the passage . The boy kept looking at the ground , but he stuck out his hand . " A fine boy , " the priest said , noticing the carefully ironed shirt and the black hair plastered to the skull with water and oil . The hand he shook so heartily was cold and damp  --  on a steaming day . " Another Livaudais , " Eddie was saying , " name Henry . " " Sure , sure , sure , sure , " the priest said . " Though I have n't caught sight of him in some little time now . " Eddie shook his head , silently . " He ai n't been seen , " Mike Livaudais answered for him , " for eight days now . " The priest put his black satchel down on the shell path . " What ? " Mike took a deep breath and let it out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shotguns and his pirogue . " " So that 's it . " The priest 's voice was hollow , all of a sudden , and flat . Mike nodded . " And he do n't come back . " " God have mercy on him , " the priest said automatically . He turned and stared , through the riggings of the luggers , over the expanse of bay , to the saw-grass prairie , greenish yellow under the hot sun . " And does nobody keep the kids at home ? " " A boy sort of got to go out and look around , " Eddie said , and the group mumbled agreement . " He was n't even a man . " The priest got a handkerchief and mopped his face . " He got lost , him , " Phil Livaudais said softly  --  sadly but without anger . Damn their resignation , the priest thought.  | " A boy got to look around , " Chep Songy said . " And does he have to go killing himself . " The priest slapped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die , " Mike said , " for sure . " Father Ryan rubbed his face again , even harder . " Maybe , " Eddie said quietly and almost patiently  --  as if he were explaining something to a very young child . " But we been living like that all our lives , and we ai n't like to change now . " " Maybe he ai n't dead , " Pete said softly . Nobody answered . And nobody looked at him . It was all very still  --  just the jays screaming at each other in the mulberry trees . Then the priest picked up his satchel quickly and walked down the path . They followed him without saying a word  --  only the far-off crying of kids , and the squaak of a cat  --  until they had got to the wharf itself . " Who is it now , " the priest said , " to take me back ? " " He was n't married , for sure , " Chep Songy said , " but he got a family . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked and his voice shook . " Only a month ago , there were three of them in the swamps around Petit Prairie . " " Got to die , one year or the other . " Stanislaus Ryan shook his head . And turned to the line of moored boats . " Not so many of you are working on a Sunday , " he said . " We stay home , " Chep Songy said , " to look . . . . " That was just so much money less , the priest thought with a start , for the living . So much less for the living to eat because of the time it took to find the dead . And none of this was thoughts he should be having . . . . " You talking like he 's dead , " Pete said . His voice , normallyhigh-pitched  --  the voice of a boy  --  was squeaky and shrill . " Maybe he ai n't . " A little more , the priest thought , and the boy would be hysterical . Mike reached one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low it gave him only an inch of forehead . " We come to ask you something . "  | " I will say a Mass for him in the morning . " Eddie waved an impatient hand at the interruption . " We got to die , " he said , " but we do n't got to leave ourselves lay out in the swamps . " The men murmured agreement . Mike said : " My nephew , he was young and he make a mistake , but he do n't have to stay out in the marsh like a muskrat . " " Animals eating his clothes and his skin and his meat . " " My bones , " Pete said , and his voice was quavering like awoman 's . " I can feel it like it was me . " Somebody mumbled a reply . " Stop it , " the priest said and swung with his satchel at the biggreen flies . " If he has died , God will take care of him . " " When old Anton , he drowned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " they went back into Orange Bay , you remember ? " The priest shook his head . " Maybe that was before you come . . . and they took candles and a priest with them . " The priest smashed a fly against his trouser leg , leaving a smear of blood . " And they put the candles on squares of wood and lit ' em and set ' em adrift , " Chep Songy said . " And the candles they draw Anton up from the bottom . They draw him right up to them . " " And maybe , they do n't do that , they show us which direction we start looking in , " Phil Livaudais said . " Such a big prairie to find a man in , " Ray Songy added . And that was the only word he said the whole time . A gull circled overhead and gave its long trumpeting call . " The candles showed them where he was . " Pete 's body was shaking all over , like a malaria chill . " Ferm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want me to do that ? " They nodded . " And if there was any use to it , " Father Ryan said , " I 'd stay and do it . . . . But it ca n't work . And there 's the CYO meeting tonight that ca n't go on without me . . . . And there 's no use in any of this , " he added . Eddie , Phil Livaudais , and his three boys turned and walked away , without a look over their shoulders , without a word.  |p235Their  silence bothered Stanislaus Ryan . " I 'm not telling you no , " the priest said . " The poor boy 's got a right to rest in holy ground . " Chep Songy left . One arm over Pete 's shoulder , he turned him around gently . The boy was still shivering . " If God wills , " the priest said , " you will find him , right here , without any candles or any hunting . " Jerry and Ray Songy turned off and disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you 're the one to take me home , " the priest said . Mike nodded . They went to his boat . The priest put his bag in the wheelhouse and looked around expectantly . Mike had gone over and lifted the cover of the engine hatch . His chin on one hand , he was looking inside . " What 's the matter , man ? " Father Ryan said . " Nothing , " Mike said , " only I got a bit of trouble here . " The priest went back to the wheelhouse and sat down . Mikestudied the engine for a few more minutes , then got to his feet . " Where are you going ? " " Maybe it the battery , " he said . " I got to go see about getting it checked . " He jumped over to the dock and hurried off . It was then about one o'clock.  |p236I  T was around one o'clock too when Annie finally got out of bed . She picked her good dress off the floor where she had dropped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip in which she had slept was wet through with perspiration . She took it off , yanking it roughly when it stuck over her shoulders . She hung the slip and bra by their straps from the loop of the window shade . Maybe they 'll dry out fresh enough , she thought . Probably wo n't , she answered herself . Annie went and looked out the window . She put both hands on the sill and leaned her weight on them as she stretched out the window . There was nobody in sight . Even the hens had gone into the shade . If there was anybody there , she thought , they could see me . Would n't they be shocked to see me , standing in the window naked on a Sunday afternoon . There was a wide slant of sun just barely touching the sill . Thrusting out her chest she touched her nipples to the white warmth . It tingled , way up under her armpits . She tried to touch her breast with her mouth . She doubled her neck and craned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just bigger , she thought , if they just were . . . Nose to shoulder , she sniffed at her skin . A faint odor of sweat , and saliva and a heavy sweet odor , mostly tobacco . She crinkled her nose . That was enough to make you sick . If bodies just did n't smell so . And if you just did n't have to keep taking baths . Back at the convent there had been a long room , white tiled , walls and floor , with a row of white tubs , five of them . Every day she had gone in , carrying her towels and piece of soap . She could tell in a second if the tubs were busy or not ; she did not even have to look in them . She was too shy to look directly , but she could tell in a second if there was an empty tub . Her eyes would flick downp237the wall at the row of black nuns ' robes hung on white hooks against the white tile . If there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She only felt relaxed when she was stretched out in the tub , staring straight at the ceiling . Sometimes when the room was empty she 'd spent half an hour in the tub , stretching and sloshing the water over her body . . . . But here on the island she did n't like bathing at all ; she did no more of it than she had to . She sniffed again at her skin . And now she would have to . Her father called at the door : " Game 's on . " " No thanks , " she said , " I 'm busy . " " You used to like it . " That was true . She 'd always listened with him on a Sunday afternoon . " I got plenty to do , " she said . He put his head in the door . " Hey , " she said , and felt her ears go red , " get out of here . " " What eating on you ? " " Get out , " she yelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said quietly , " I been seeing you without no clothes ever since you was a baby . " She rushed at the door and slammed it closed . There were no locks in the house , so she leaned against it . " Jesus God , " he said again slowly . " I ai n't a baby , " she yelled through the door , " you got to remember I ai n't a baby . . . . You got to quit walking in . . . I 'm getting a lock . " He went back to the porch : she heard the rocker begin . She stood leaning with one shoulder against the door  --  she did n't know how long . She was n't thinking of anything . She was just listening : to the little house sounds , to the sounds of the still afternoon , to her own heart pounding . Finally she heard the quick light steps of Adele . If she comes in , Annie thought , I 'll throw her out . And she 's not so big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped still out in the hall . " Annie ? " Annie let her call two or three more times before she answered . " What ? "  | " Are you sick ? " " Jesus ! " Annie leaned her head back against the door and shrieked . " Jesus Christ . . . there 's nothing wrong with me . Nothingat all . " " You going to eat dinner with us ? " Adele 's careful speech did not change . She did not seem the slightest annoyed or upset . " Sure , " Annie said . " I got to eat . . . . Do n't I live here ? . . . Do n't I get to eat here ? " " We getting ready to eat dinner . " " You inviting me ? " Adele did not answer . Annie listened while she walked away . " Al , I 'm putting dinner out , " she heard her say . Annie turned back in the room . And put on a pair of shorts and a shirt . Without washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her hair a quick brush . Then she closed the door very carefully behind her and went to the porch . They were there and seated at the table , the boy Claudie between them . He was the first one to see her ; he flashed his wide baby-tooth grin , and they looked around . " Hey there , " her father said , " we did n't think you 'd make it until tomorrow . " " I thought she would , " Adele said quickly . " I told you she 'd make it . " " I owe you a nickel , " Al said . " Do n't put any money on me , " Annie said and swung her leg over the back of her chair . " Jesus . . . chicken ! " " Thought you liked that , " Al said . " Now I just thought of something , " Annie said . " All our names begin with A . . . excepting frog-eyes here . " " That is right , for sure , " Al said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Have n't we got any coffee ? " Annie asked . " Right in front of you , " Adele said . Her father laughed and bending over whispered loudly in Claudie 's ear : " She 's got herself a hangover . " " Maybe . " Annie sipped the top of the coffee , loudly . " You have a bit too much ? " " It was n't too much , " Annie said.  |p239He  chuckled again . He was in fine humor . Claudie laughed too , imitating him . Annie finished the cup and reached across the table for the blue enameled pot . She knocked over the jar of peppers . " It 's all right , " Adele said . " The top was on . " " Would n't care if it was n't . " Annie poured the coffee in a thick splashing stream . " Man , man , " her father said , " she sure got herself a bad head this morning . " " I ca n't do anything , " Annie asked , " without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to know that much .... " From the radio inside there was a burst of static . Al jumped upand went to fix it . Annie chewed on a piece of chicken . " It 's tough . " " You got a bad piece , " Adele said , quick and eager , " take anotherone . " " All tough , " Annie said . " What we had was fine . " " Tough old rooster . " " You talking about me ? " Al had come back . " Annie says the wing is tough . " There was just a little edge of nervousness in Adele 's voice . Annie felt a funny little quiver of satisfaction , and she almost grinned to herself . " That right ? " her father said . " Was n't nothing wrong with mine . " " Like leather , " Annie said . " Pelicans leading by four runs in the seventh , " he said . Adele gave him a quick little uncertain smile and glanced back at Annie . " Two out and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any attention to her , che ' . She do n't feel too good this morning . " " I feel fine , " Annie said . " Why do people keep telling me how I feel ? " " You was asking me the other day , " Al said . " Thought we 'd go take a look at Bayou Cantaque . " " Hell , " Annie said , " I been up there a hundred times . " " Was n't talking to you , " Al said . " You want to , che ' ? " " I never been up there , " Adele said.  |p240Al  waved his hands , like a priest . " So we go . " Annie said : " Thought you 'd be sick to death of boats , being on ' em all week long . " For a minute Adele looked like Claudie when he was going to cry . " God damn it , " Al said , " Do n't nobody ask me ? I want to go , me . " Annie drank the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of satisfaction . " I do n't think I 'm coming , " she said . " Okay , " Al said . " You sure you do n't want to ? " Adele asked . " Told you I been a hundred times . " " She wants to stay and see her boyfriend , " Al said . " You do n't know nothing , " Annie said . " You think so , bebe ? " her father pulled the ends of his mustache , curling them carefully . " Yea , " Annie said and licked the last spot of coffee off her saucer . " You want me to tell you what I know about what you was doing last night . " " Yea , " Annie said and curled up her lip . " Okay , bebe , " Al said . " George Manint , he been by this morning , asking if you get home all right . " " Talk , " Annie said , " all people do around here  --  talk , talk , talk and talk . Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You was asking me , " Al said , " and I 'm telling you . . . . George got a real fine hangover , him . Can hardly open his eyes . And he feel sort of bad . . . he took a swing at Marie Louise and she 's beginning to get a bruise on her jaw , and she threw a can at him , only it went out the open window instead . Anyhow he 's feeling sick and he do n't see how he can go home , things being the way they are there . " " I could get me a job in New Orleans , " Annie said . " Easy as anything . At the telephone office . " " And there another thing he feeling bad about . . . . Seems he nearly cut up you boyfriend account of he thought he was waiting for Marie Louise . "  |p241Annie  was staring up into the blue-white sky , her lips curled back and smiling . " So , " Al said . " And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be smart to put that together . . . . Annie continued staring up in the sky . " I do n't care , " she said . " I do n't care the least bit . " Al got to his feet . " If we going , we got to go soon . " Adele said : " I 'm all fixed . " When they were gone , Annie sat lazily following the flight of a green mosquito hawk . He perched finally on her knee and softly she got hold of his wings . She held him up then , close to her eyes , watching the waving legs and the straining arc of the tail . " Sh oo , " she said and blew at him . Under her fingers the wings were crisp and fluttery and dry as paper . She stared into his goggle eyes . " Sh  --  oo . " She threw him up into the air . Her aim was bad . He hit one of the porch posts and fell into the yard . A fat jay swooped down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is talk , " she told the hot afternoon . " You go to the can and somebody knows it . . . . I do n't care , me . " But she did . If everybody knew it , something was spoiled . She shrugged and got up , went inside and turned on the radio . They had ruined it , she told herself bitterly . They ruin everything . . . . She stretched out on the sofa . Her head was aching and her eyes felt funny . She began to wish she had n't taken the chicken . What was it like up in Bayou Cantaque , she wondered . What it was like in all of them , she answered : grasses that were always moving slightly and rustling slightly even when there was no wind , and water that was thick and black and so still  --  if you dropped a leaf , it sat motionless on the shiny surface . The shiny surface that reflected back at you like a mirror . And you could no more see through it than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was under it . Alligators , for one ; they came up sometimes to kill muskrats on the bank with one flick of their tails . And Congos , the long black snake that swamp242like a fish , people said , and had a bite that would kill the strongest man alive in just three hours . You 'd see their heads standing up sometimes out of the water , and looking for all the world like a plain dark stick . And the creatures lines and nets brought up : gars whose scales made belts tough as leather ; big catfish with whiskers and twin barbs ; and eels , their mouths filled with sharp white teeth . She shivered and swallowed a couple of times . She was glad she was n't a man and had to work those waters . I 'd as soon give up and go in to Port Ronquille and get a job at the sulphur plant , she thought . Even if the sulphur got in your lungs and killed you , little by little , it was better . And then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing their whole lives long . Like Beatriz , who could n't even do her hair . Who hardly knew how to brush it . Who had never seen an iron . Who learned to use it with floods of Spanish words . If I had just remembered them , Annie thought . And what would Beatriz be doing right now ? This same minute . She might be still at the convent . Or she might have gone home . Annie had thought about that home sometimes ; she could imagine the place ( Beatriz never talked about it , but one of the nuns had told Annie the little bit she knew ) . The shadowy rooms , one stretching after the other in endless procession , tremendous halls lined with mirrors , a court where mimosa was so sweet and heavy you could hardly breathe . Annie thought over the picture slowly , touching here and there , smiling to herself . There 'd be closets so crammed with clothes you could n't shut the door . And the curtains at the windows would be satin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue , at the sides draped up by big gold hooks , and over the window part there 'd be white lace , sheer as organdy , and billowing out in the small steady breeze . And there 'd be white bearskin rugs on the floor , changed every day so there was never a speck of dirt on them . And a dressing-table , all mirrors with tall thin bottles of perfume , so many that you 'd forget about the ones in the back . Annie stretched and drifted back to the island . That would be the life , she thought . How did some people get it , she wondered . How were some born lucky . . . . She liked this house better when it was empty . She walked fromp243room to room . It was n't a bad house , the way island houses went . And it was pretty cool in summer . She 'd seen worse places in New Orleans , and that was for sure . In the kitchen she found some left-over coffee and poured it into a dirty cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perched on the tablette outside the window . And all of a sudden she was facing her big problem , and it was plain as the dumpy form of the bird : did she put on some lipstick and take a walk down to the wharf or did she wait for Inky to look for her ? Adele had left a pack of cigarettes on the table . She took one and lit it . She tried to inhale , choked , and gave up . She held the cigarette to her knee and watched the white thread of smoke crawl over her skin . It would n't do to let him think she was too eager . . . . She half closed her eyes and tried to look bored . . . . She 'd just have to wait until he came . Of course there was nothing that said she could n't go down and have a peep , if she stayed behind the palmettos and was careful that he did n't see her . And if he forgot , maybe she could think of an excuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Cecile . Somebody who would remind him , without saying , of her . . . . She could work something out , if she had to . But he would n't forget . The cigarette was out . She must have knocked off the coal . She got another match from the back of the stove and lit it . . . . A holder would be nice . She was crazy not to bring one from New Orleans . . . . Maybe she should wash her hair today ; it was beginning to have a little sweet-sweaty smell . And what sort of shampoo . .. . She 'd just have to take a walk over to Arcenaux 's and have a look at what he had . She 'd try a new one . She dropped the cigarette into the last little bit of coffee . And then she remembered something else : Inky did not know where she lived . She ran her fingers under her hair , fluffing it up . She could go then . She could just happen along the dock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . Because of Adele . She was an old maid , Annie thought as she started anotherp244cigarette . She should have gone to the convent ; they 'd have loved her there . She even sat like a lady or a nun  --  straight up , so straight that her back curved a little . Jesus . . . . And what was it the nuns had told her : a lady never spills things in her lap . If she spills , she spills on her bosom . . . . Annie dropped the half-smoked cigarette into the dish water . Let Adele object . . . . If her hair was going to be dry by tonight , she 'd have to get going . She got a chair and climbed up to the top cupboard shelf . There was a coffee can there . She opened it , reached below the dark brown grounds and got a dollar bill . She started to leave , hesitated a minute , then went back to the coffee pot and shook it thoughtfully . She drank the little that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 245FOR a while Father Ryan waited patiently on the Bozo , sitting in the little shade of the wheelhouse , reading his breviary . But he came to the end of that , and he put the book on top of his coat , which he had taken off and folded carefully on the deck , stood up and looked around . The wharf was completely deserted  --  not even a seagull or a pelican moving  --  with one exception : a young man by the sailboata couple of hundred feet away . He wore bathing-trunks and his body was shining with sweat ; he was finishing his washing in a big tub set on the dock . Father Ryan walked over . " Hot work , " he said . The young man looked up briefly . " Yea , " he said . There was a line running from forestay to mast , and hung over it were some long pieces of foam rubber , mattress-shaped . Other lines from spreaders to mast held blue-and-white-striped cotton covers . Inky straightened up . " This is no day for work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till early in the morning . " " I spilled some coffee on the covers , " Inky said , " and I had to get it out before it stained . " He tipped the tub and poured the water through the cracks in the wharf . " Mildew got in some , " he said , " so I did the lot . " " A fine-looking boat . " " Yes , " Inky said , " I just work on her . " ( Annie had come up just then and stopped behind the heavy tangle of bay trees and palmettos . She held the bottle of shampoo in her left hand and with her right she lifted a single palm leaf to see . She saw the freshly washed covers hanging limp in the still air . And she could feel first her ears , then her whole face go bright red.  |p246It  was the sunburn , she told herself , she 'd have to get some grease on it before she got sick . She backed out of the thicket and walked home slowly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stretched out , flat on her back , on her bed , and cried small angry tears . ) " A racing-boat ? " the priest asked . " And cruising . " " I used to go to the races on the lakefront sometimes when I was in New Orleans . " " It 's fun , " Inky said . He hung the tub upside down over a piling . " I got some ice below , " he said , " how about a drink ? " Father Ryan nodded and came on board . " Up in the shade under the covers , " Inky said , " it 'll be cool enough . " They were sitting there , cross-legged on the deck , when Mike Livaudais came back . He did not seem to notice them . He walked on to the Bozo . Father Ryan got up to follow him . " Better luck this time , " Inky said . Mike was staring sadly into the engine hatch . He straightened up when the priest came aboard . " I offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hard deck . " He was different , Stanislaus Ryan thought ; he was less sad now , and more determined . The priest wondered . He took off his glasses and polished them on his sleeve . " How long will it take you to fix the engine ? " Mike shrugged . " It is old , yes , and , like old people , it get funny things wrong with it . " " Was it the battery ? " Mike threw out his hands . " How can I tell ? Can I look in the inside of the case and see what is going on there ? Can I see through lead ? " The priest was scratching his chin with his glasses . " You were going to get somebody to test the battery . " Mike waved his hand around again . " And that Story LeBlanc , I have looked for him . I have looked all up and down for him . Everywhere I could think of , I look for him . And he is not there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lookingp247down . " I got to do the best I can , myself , me . I got to get to work . " " And how long will that take ? " Mike shrugged . " And the other boats now . . . do you think they could be taking me back ? " Mike straightened up and stared down the line of moored luggers . " Hector , now , he is working on his hull . " " Where ? " Father Ryan asked , " I do n't see . " " From inside , " Mike said . " And the Mickey Mouse got something wrong with her rudder . And the St. Cristopher  --  that the same Story LeBlanc I am looking for and do n't find . . . . And for sure we do n't want to take you back in a chabec . . . but no ! That is just too much a risky business . And what would everybodysay if we drown the priest . . . . " " Yes , " said Father Ryan , " for sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat , the last one  --  la-bas , " he pointed , " and he is out taking his new wife for a ride some-where . " The priest nodded . " And you do not ask me to steal a man 's boat while he is gone ? " " No , " Father Ryan said . " No . " " And you see the other boats , they gone working . " " I see . " " But you be cheerful , " Mike said , " I get this fixed . " Father Ryan stifled a yawn in the heat . " Why you do n't come back to the house with me ? My wife she be proud to have a priest in her house . " The priest got to his feet slowly , one knee at a time . This was a different man , he thought , from an hour ago . Altogether different . . . . And he was beginning now to see what was happening . And he was n't sure he liked that any better . Mike slapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot . . . you must not have any dinner . . . . How the dogs they must be growling inside you . " Stanislaus Ryan was a young man , but he felt very tired . " I suppose I am hungry . "  | " I got to have my head examined , letting you starve in front of my very eyes . " Mike got him by one arm and helped him over the rail like a cripple . " Mother Mary , " Mike said , " how I going to talk to myself for doing this . " " It 's fine , " Father Ryan said . " I 'm fine . " They walked up the path to the house . They did not meet anyoneon the way , Father Ryan noticed , though there must be plenty people around . And all the time Mike was talking . " I go find that Story LeBlanc . . . sal au pri  --  excuse , " and he crossed himself . " And I make him tell me why he go and hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . And I take my engine apart , I got to fix it . . . and maybe LeBlanc he take you , if mine do n't go . " Soon as they got in the front gate , Marie Livaudais came rushing down the steps and got Father Ryan by the other arm . They led him in the house , both talking now . And he had the feeling that had he stopped , they would have just dragged him along and not even noticed . There was dinner  --  ready , and not touched . Father Ryan looked at it , scratched his chin again , and kept on wondering . They got him to the table , urged him to sit down . Theypushed the chair persuasively against the back of his knees . " Now , " Mike shouted , " la neigre , she will feed you good , no ? " Over by the stove his wife said something without turningaround . " And do n't you bring none of the children in here . " Mike yelled out the window : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat later . " There was a murmur and then crying of kids . " They must be hungry , " Father Ryan said . " Bunch of cannibals , " Mike scowled . " Not more than two days ago , when we was having shrimp . . . " Boiled shrimp , " Marie said , " plain cold boiled shrimp . " " And one of ' em , he ca n't stand the sight of another one , and he pick up a shrimp and throw it . And before we got chance to grab anybody , that dish  --  big , big platter , you can put four duck on it and no spilling over  --  that dish is all gone and the shrimp they is all over the room . "  | " Got on the wall , " Marie said . " Smell . " Father Ryan sniffed . " I ca n't tell , " he said . Mike patted him gently on the back . " The Father , he is so polite , him ! " " It 's the seminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach to be polite in the seminary . " Stanislaus Ryan opened his mouth , then closed it again . Mike bent down , staring into his mouth . " You was going to saysomething , yes ? Shut up ! the Father , he going to say something . " " I was n't , " Father Ryan said . " Nothing . " Mike looked disappointed and straightened up again . A couple of black heads appeared at the window . " Filez d'ici ! " Mike roared . " They must be getting hungry , " the priest suggested . " Do n't go being sorry for them , " Marie said . " And you shut up too , " Mike said , " with us waiting for food and getting fainter and fainter . " He waved his hands again . " Mo ' pere , do n't go being polite , just to save our feelings .... " He opened the armoire that stood in one corner of the kitchen . Down on the bottom , behind the dresses and coats that were hanging there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , a gallon jug , and held it to the light . " Marie , her cousin 's husband , made it . " She had the glasses on the table . Mike poured them . Father Ryan tasted carefully . " Oh . . . " he said , " orange wine . " " Shu . . . " Marie nodded . " My cousin 's husband do n't make nothing but the orange wine . " " And the best , che ' , " Mike said . " Let 's us not go forgetting to say that . " " How you like it ? " Marie asked . " Very fine . " The wine was strong and very sweet . " And you have nothing like that back where you come from ? " Marie asked . " In New Orleans ? " " That where you from ? " He nodded . " You not from Ireland ? " " Marie , you getting mixed up , for sure , " Mike said . " That was the priest before , name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " He went and left . " They had found him one morning tossing oyster shells at imaginary cats in the church yard . " Thought it was you , " Marie said . Father Ryan shook his head . They had dinner while the kids stood outside and watched them , and occasionally squabbled among themselves . " And do you think you 're going to get that engine fixed this afternoon ? " Mike slapped his forehead . " I have forgot . I am having such a fine time eating dinner with you , it had gone out of my mind entirely . " He jumped to his feet , knocking the table so that the dishes rattled together . " I 'll come with you , " the priest said . " But no . . . " Mike picked up a rocking-chair and carried it to the front porch . " Down at the boat it is hot and there is no reason you should sweat like me . . . . You sit here , and my wife , she be out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I could help . " Mike smiled , sadly , so that the missing-teeth gaps at the sides of his mouth showed . " And what you know about engines ? " " Well , now . . . " " You know about God , " Mike said ; " me , I know about engines . ... I come get you when I have it fixed . " He bowed Father Ryan into the rocking-chair and left him . Stanislaus Ryan put his elbows on the arms of the chair and his chin on his hands , as he watched Mike out of sight . You could hear people laughing and yelling far off , but around the house it was very quiet . Even the children , back in the kitchen , were quiet ; they must be getting fed . There was a telephone on the island somewhere , he remembered . Later on , he would have to use it to tell the housekeeper back at the rectory at Petit Prairie that the CYO would have to meet without him  --  if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't really think it would . Marie came out , carrying some sewing in her hands , a bright yellow and red piece of cotton . He looked from her to the spotp251where the steady , square , plodding back of her husband had disappeared . " Such fine liars , " he muttered . " Pardon , " she said and cupped a hand around her ear . " But I did not hear , me . " " It was nothing , " he said . " And I was n't talking to you . " It was nearly six o'clock before the engine was fixed . Mike sent a kid up to tell Father Ryan . " It sounds right now , no ? " Mike asked him . Father Ryan cocked his head and listened . " You did n't have a hard time with it . " " Mother Mary , but I had a time , for sure ! " " You did n't get dirty , " he pointed out . " Ah , but I am smart and the Marie she get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I take off my clothes . " " All of them ? " " Down to the underwear . . . right now my underwear , they are filthy . " Father Ryan shook his head and got on board . " I been thinking , " Mike said . " I know , " the priest said . " You know what I been thinking ? " " Only maybe , " the priest said . " It being so late now , " Mike said , " and it ai n't far out the way to Catfish Bay . . . it would n't take long . " And the technical charge , Father Ryan thought , what would it be : kidnapping ? He had heard of this happening  --  to doctors , to priests ; and there 'd been the stories back in the seminary . . . . But he 'd imagined it somehow as more dramatic . He almost chuckled . Well anyway , he thought , a sense of humor helps . And he could see that he was going to Catfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wondered : What would they do if I said no ? Would it ever get violent . . . . It was a silly idea , he thought , but it was n't sinful . There was no reason why he should n't . It was irregular , and maybe it was n't done in the best religious spirit , but then what was . . . . And God would be one to understand .. . . And if he said no , there 'd be more engine trouble for surep252again . And just as sure he would n't be getting home tonight . If you started looking into people 's motives too closely  --  well , who would you admit . . . They 'd just as soon keep him here all night . And he had the five-o'clock Mass . If he did n't turn up , the old boy would be furious , and so would the other assistant . And they 'd be as rude to him as they could without sinning . It would n't be very pleasant all together . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p253MUCH  later that night , toward midnight , the Bozo came back and docked quietly . There were five or six men on her , and they had the lines in place in a couple of seconds . They left the boat then , walking off their separate ways quickly . The moon had made the white shell paths bright , almost , as daylight . Mike said : " Quit asking me . . . and get the god-damn kids outa here . Why ai n't they in bed ? They ought a be in bed . " Marie hissed at the kids , who disappeared . You could hear them scuffling softly in the loft overhead . " I need a drink , me . " Marie moved to the armoire . " No , god damn . . . I do n't want no wine . . . . Where you hide the bottle whisky ? " She reached under the sink , behind the boxes of soap powder , and got out the bottle . " Right there ? " he said . " Right out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . You losing you mind ? " " Did they find it now ? .. . You tell me did they get any ? . . . He looked at the bottle and grunted . " Full soap powder . " " Wipe it off , " she said . " Ai n't nobody making you eat it . " He poured himself a drink . " Quit asking me . . .. " " I ai n't said nothing . " He took a couple of swallows of whisky straight . " There a way for doing things , " he said , " and a way not . We did it wrong . . . . The priest now , he did n't want to go . And when we got there , he was in a hurry to get off again . And the candles , they kept going out . And there was n't nobody could tell which way they was pointing . " He put his feet up on the kitchen table . Little bits and pieces of mud crumbled off the soles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messing you kitchen , " he said and squinted at her with one eye tight shut , " go on and tell me . " " You hear me saying anything ? " " Good thing , " he muttered into the glass . " I push you head around back . " " I ai n't said nothing . .. . You hear me saying nothing ? " " Jesus God , " he said . " And then the priest , he says , I told you it would n't do no good . ' . . . If he was n't no priest , ordained and in church , I push him over right there and let the gars have a work at him . " He crossed his feet and a little more dirt fell on the table . " We tried , " he said , " no son of a bitch going to call us not men for trying . " Overhead the kids giggled softly . " Ai n't they asleep yet ? " he said . " They all excited for sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stove , hands on her hips , her bare feet planted far apart . That was the way she did when she expected to stand a long time . " And I expect they are listening . " " Good ! " He banged down his glass on the floor by his chair . " Pour me another drink . . . . And maybe it learns them to stay out the swamp . And maybe it do n't . . . . You pour the whisky like an old aunt . " He yanked the bottle away . She did not answer . She went back to her position in front of the stove . He drank the whisky in short nibbling gulps . The kids were very still , and there was n't a thing moving outside . " And that Eddie . . . " he shook his head . He was silent so long that she finally asked : " What about Eddie ? " " I come back , the pit of my belly froze up . Only just now the likker is warming me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't want to be him , " he said . " Looking at his face from the outside , I would n't be inside him for nothing . " He stared up at the dark uncovered beams of the ceiling , stained almost black by years of cooking under them . " Not for nothing . " " You go back tomorrow ? " He nodded , very slightly.  | " And the shrimp , they are running too . I hear that from Gary Alonzo . " " Maybe , " Mike said , " I hear the same thing . The other men , let them go out . The Livaudais , they got something got to be done . " " You want another drink ? " He shook his head . " Ca n't have no hangover on me in the morning . " " Listen , " Marie took a couple of steps toward him , " you going to talk to the kids , no ? You going to talk to them ? " " What for ? " " While this is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about not going too far back in there . Like . . . " she hesitated for a moment , " Henry done . " " Yea , " he said , " only not now . " She clucked her tongue . " I was n't asking you to do it now . Only sometime . " " Yes , " he said . " For sure . " She picked up a rag out of the sink and went over to wipe the fingerprints off the door of the icebox . They were greasy . She sprinkled a little soap powder on the rag and worked at them . " We go again . " " You think , " she said still scrubbing away , " he might be living yet ? " " He shoulda know better . He know enough not to go so far he ca n't get out . Why n't he stay where he knew his way ? " " He was n't a stupid kid , " she said . " He knew better , for sure . . . . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . maybe ? " He just shook his head to answer . " Quit looking like that , " Eddie said to Belle . " I 'm going back , me . First thing in the morning . "  |p256BEFORE  light the following morning , Hector Boudreau and Al Landry were down at the dock . And a few minutes later Eddie Livaudais came , a gunny sack of food over his shoulder , a shotgun in his hand . He was dressed for a long day 's sun too : a longsleevedheavy white cotton shirt , a pair of white cotton pants and a wide-brimmed straw hat . And not three steps behind him came his brother Mike , his wife 's brother Chep and Chep 's son , Jerry . Al and Hector moved over to meet them . Eddie was walking along with short jerky steps , his eyes on the ground right in front of him ; so he did n't see them until he almost walked into them . Then he looked up sharply and waved his hand . " No , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Al Landry pushed back his own cap . " Me and Hector was just wondering . " Eddie shook his head sharply . " Four do much as six or eight . " " No offense , " Hector said . " Hell , man , no , " Mike said , and glanced at his brother . Eddie was terribly nervous ; he could hardly stand still at all . " If we need any , we call for you sure . " " Look , " Hector said , " lemme run you over to Catfish Bay . . . . I been wanting to try out that engine . " " That 's an idea , for sure , " Al said . " And it save you that much paddling . " " Maybe . . . " Mike turned to Eddie , " you the boss . " " You going to paddle far enough , " Hector said , " once you get there . " " That 's the idea , " Al said . " You got enough paddling , " Hector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were bothering him . He kept blinking very fast . " Okay , " he said.  |p257Hector  got the blowers going . Chep and Jerry put their shotgunsand their gear on board and then went to get lines to the two pirogues . Eddie did not offer to help . He just stood and watched , blinking . " You do n't want to put the sack on board ? " Al asked . AndEddie was surprised to find he still had it slung over his shoulder . " Hot as hell , " Jerry said . Mike chuckled . " You ai n't seen nothing , kid , " he said . " That bothers you , you might just go home straight off . " Jerry tested the muscles in his right shoulder . " Do n't reckon I will . " " You ai n't seen nothing , " Mike said . " Vieux couillon ! But this ai n't nothing at all . " Annie Landry sat in front of the mirror and undid her curlers . She brushed out her hair carefully  --  the shampoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that was n't bad either . Then she made up , very carefully , even to the mascara . Earlier that morning , she had climbed up to the top of the largest oak tree , the one that grew way in the back , by the pigpen . And from its top she could see the wharf  --  the boats were all out working , except for the Livaudais 's two , and the Pixie . She finished her make-up and stuffed the shirt down into her pants . She ran one finger testingly up and down her legs : she had shaved this morning and her skin still prickled a little . Then she walked slowly across the island . Inky was in the little clump of trees that reached right down to the wharf . He had got a canvas chair from somewhere , and he was sitting and reading . " Well , hi ! " he said . " I was beginning to think you 'd disappeared for good . " " I 've been around . " " Not down here , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " but you were busy washing . . . " she stopped , remembering she should n't have mentioned that . " You damn right I was . " He began laughing , slapping his knees . " That was one on me , " he said . " Spent all yesterday morning washing . "  |p258Already  she was wishing she had not come . But there was no way back , so she went on recklessly . " I 'm real sorry , " she said , " but it never happened before . " He laughed harder . " You damn right it did n't . " The book fell off his lap and he stopped to pick it up . " I did n't mean that . " " Oh hell , " he said , " tell me what 's going on around here . " " Nothing , " she said , " nothing ever does . " " Okay , " he said , " I 'll tell you the news . . . the bastards I nearly had a fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , they went out somewhere in Hector 's boat , with a couple of pirogues . And then , maybe a couple hours later , Hector comes back alone , and picks up his crew . You know , the crippled man , and your boyfriend , with the tobacco name . " " Not my boyfriend , " Annie said . He lifted one eyebrow and winked . She was uncertain , so that it was an actual pain . She could not look at him . " I got things to do , " she almost whispered and turned away . " You have a mean hangover ? " " No , " she said . " Man , I did . " She was moving quietly away when he said : " You want to have a drink with me tonight ? " They had a drink at the Rendezvous , which was almost empty on a Monday night  --  only Story LeBlanc playing a game of pool with Lacy Livaudais . " You 're extra pretty , " Inky said , " when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They listening over there . " " Okay , " Inky said , and stood up . " I know another place . "  |p259THEY  were gone , the two Livaudais and the two Songy men , hunting for Henry , nearly three days . First the Hula Girl took them across the bay , then up a small deep bayou to a second smaller one , and finally to Catfish Bay  --  they had taken the priest there only the day before ; and if they had looked they could have found some of the floating blocks of wood with bits of candle still stuck to them . They changed to their pirogues . And the Hula Girl turned back . From here on , it would be too shallow for the lugger . They paddled up through the low salt marsh , looking for some sign , all the way up to the heavy swamp . They spent the night there on the edge . And in the morning , soon as it was light , they went in far as they dared . They went in far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little farther , marking their own way carefully . And every hour or so , they fired the shotguns in the air or down in the water . There was never an answer . That night , they lit the cypress torches they 'd brought . And Mike Livaudais sent up the flares . They all watched the red and white colors stream out , way , way over the vine tangle tops of the big cypress trees . And they 'd waited . Mike sent up four different flares , all that he had . And there was only the faint hissing and the sharp searing smell . Chep Songy scratched his chin . And in the swamp silence the finger over his beard made a rasping sound . And finally Eddie Livaudais lowered his head from the empty night sky where the flares had been . " Let 's us go back , " he said . They took the shortest way , and they paddled all night , taking turns now , for they were dead tired . But more than that , they wanted to get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the slime-coated water . By daylight they were back in the marshes behind Isle auxp260Chiens . The cranes were still asleep in the little ponds in the grasses : eight or ten white shapes clustered together . The still heavy water streaked back from the paddles in a long v. . . . When they got near the end of the marsh Chep Songy grunted to his boy to stop paddling and motioned toward the shotguns in the center of the pirogue . He fired both barrels from his ; the boy added a third . " Maybe , " Chep said , as much to himself as to anyone else , " it is three shells wasted , but maybe somebody , they hear and come . " Perique Lombas heard them , and got his own boat , the Tangerine , and crossed the bay to meet them . He got there first , cut his motor and sat down to wait . While he waited , he changed the plugs , which had needed doing for some time . Perique and Robert Cheramie had built the twenty-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it all one summer , getting up before daylight so they 'd have a couple of hours cool . And Perique had taken the engine out of his old Ford , which he 'd kept for a while on the island , and spent nearly a month working on it , tuning it up , in the shade of the chinaberry tree in his back yard . The rest of the car he had pushed back up against the little chicken house , way back in the hackberry bushes . And a storm that September had torn off a limb of the old oak there , and smashed it down on top the car and jarred the doors all open . During the winter storms the grasses blew in and made drifts on the floor that went halfway up to the windows . And that spring , his mother moved some of her hens in . He saw the two pirogues finally , put on his motor and went over to pick them up . He did n't ask once about Henry . And they did n't mention it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had his answer already . When they came into the dock , there was a kid , standing back a little , by the icehouse , watching them . Only before they had landed , he turned around and disappeared . And they were n't surprised about that either . It was Pete Livaudais . The Tangerine swung into the dock . Perique left the wheel and grabbed the mooring-lines.  | " I 'm going back , me , " Eddie Livaudais said . The other men were ashore now , but he had n't moved . " Ai n't no use , " Chep said . The two other men were so tired they did n't bother talking . They picked up their shotguns and the empty sacks which had had food and water in them , and moved off , dragging their feet and stumbling on the uneven boards . Eddie started to get up from the deck . He put his hands on his knees and pushed . But he slipped sideways . Perique put the last loop in his mooring-line and jumped back aboard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pirogue this long , " Eddie said . " Sure , " Perique stuck out his foot for a brace and got one arm around the older man , and heaved him to his feet . " Got to get some sleep , " Eddie said . " Then I 'm going back . " Perique got him to the dock . " Leave the stuff , " he said , " I got to go right by you house anyways . " Eddie held out his hand , motioning for Perique to pick up the sack . " I be back by morning , me . " He lifted the almost empty sack across his shoulder . " Vec tou mo drigail , " he muttered . " Lemme bring that , " Perique said . " I 'm going right by you house . " Eddie did not seem to hear . Perique followed him down the wharf a little , not quite sure what to do . Finally Perique stopped and stood watching him  --  moving rapidly , with short little steps like a woman 's , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to fall any minute . He went out again the next morning alone . Like he said he would.  |p262HE  had found nothing , when he came back two days later . He dragged his pirogue only half out of the water and left it . ( The Songy boys came down later and carried it the rest of the way up the shell ridge . ) He did n't bother with the gear either , takingonly the shotgun and the shells . It was all he could carry . His arms had turned weak as a woman 's . And he had to go home . When he got to the house , his wife was out on the back porch , cleaning shrimp . He could see the shells flipping over into the yard , where the chickens and the cats fought for them . He knew it was his wife ; not many people on the island could work that fast . He felt his feet get heavy and just scuff the ground . He put the shotgun and the cartridge belt on the front porch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scratching his jaw : the two-day stubble was beginning to itch . " Maybe Pete , he seen me come in and he already told her , " he muttered to himself . Then he went around the house . Pete was there all right , sitting in a corner of the porch , back to the railing , smoking a cigarette . " I told you , " Eddie Livaudais said , " you too young for that . " " He ai n't all that young , " his wife said . He was standing staring down at this woman he 'd lived with for thirty years . This tall , thin woman with olive skin and straight black hair that was beginning to turn gray on top . Just on top , like a gray cap . " Let me handle the boys , my way . " He was angry at her . Angry at the way her face was so calm . " You done handle the boys your way , all this time , and I ai n't said nothing . " She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popping the meat out of the shells and flipping the rest over the railing to the yard . Eddie took off his cap and hung it on the back of her chair . " Only now , " she said slowly , " you ai n't got but one son . " He could feel that hurt , somewhere in his chest . " Pete done told you . " " He do n't got to tell me , " she said , still slowly . " I got so I can feel it in my blood , me . " Eddie walked over and with a quick move of his hand yanked the cigarette out of the boy 's mouth and flipped it over the railing with the shrimp heads . The kid half rose , then stayed where he was , his knees bent . His father reached out , taking his shoulder , pushed him back down on his heels . The head of a shrimp flashed by Eddie 's nose , not two inches away . He jerked his head around , but his wife was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side . " You taking to pushing kids around ? " she asked without movingher eyes from her work . " If he old enough to smoke , he old enough to get pushed around . " " Hey . . . " Pete said . His father looked down at him , drawing back his hand . " If there is just one more single line out of you , I going to twist your head around , just the way the old woman there does with them shrimp . And that is for sure . " " Look at him , " she said , " Eddie Livaudais , done lost one son , and getting ready to beat up the other . " " Maybe he ai n't the only thing around here I got to lick back in place , me . " " Listen at him , Pete , " she said , " him that comes back emptyhanded . Listen at him . " " Quit that , " Eddie said . " He do n't come home with Henry . He do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Eddie sat down on the top step and began to take off his shoes . " This here is the first time I had my shoes off in near three days now . " " We are right sorry for you . "  |p264The  boy Pete stared at him from under his eyebrows . He looked so much like his brother there for a minute that Eddie had to shake his head . " Why you come to quitting ? " his wife asked softly . " I ai n't quit . " " You come back , did n't you ? " He shook his head . " That 's quitting , ai n't it ? " He put an elbow on each knee and rested his weight on them . " You get tired , going for two days and nights . " She sniffed . " With hardly no sleep . " " Henry , he ai n't sleeping neither . " He looked down at the ground . There was a doodle bug working his way across the bare sun-cracked stretch . He stared at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horns : he had n't really looked at one since he was a kid . " Me , if I 'd stayed a couple of hours longer , I never would found my way out . I 'd been too tired to figure . " She did n't answer , just whistled through her teeth . He put his shoes one alongside the other on the edge of the porch . Then he began to pull off his socks slowly . His back was hurting him , in waves , like . It was the paddling . " I ai n't so young , " he said , " not any more . " The words seemed to run off and echo on the hot afternoon air . " I 'm getting on to be old , " he said , and he shivered . That meantsomebody was walking over his grave spot . " Getting old . " One of the chickens spotted the doodle bug and gulped it . " Haaaaa , " Eddie hissed . The chicken fluttered away . He put ahand to his back and straightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told Pete . " I ask you , " Pete said . " He did , for sure , " Belle said . " Shut up . " The boy looked at him without blinking . Eddie looked from one to the other . " What you got against me ? " he said . " I ai n't told him to go out . " The brown stubby fingers cleaned the gray , almost transparent shrimp . " You ought to stopped him . "  |p265Eddie  rubbed his back . Funny how he had n't noticed it until now . Not until now . " He was n't no little kid that you could lock up in a room till he forgot . " The cats were fighting for the shrimp heads . There was one down there he had n't seen before , a small torn , black and white . " Where that one come from ? " He pointed . Neither answered for a while , then the boy said : " Where they all come from , I reckon . " " I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Belle said . Eddie rested his head in his hands , and bent his body forward a little to try and relieve the ache in his back . " Pete , " he said , " go see if we ai n't got some liniment . " He began to rub the small of his back with both hands . He stopped , hearing no sound of movement behind him . " Enfant garce ! " he said softly . He plopped his hands on his knees but did not turn around . " Go get that there stuff . " He cocked his head , listening until he heard the soft pad of the boy 's feet as he got up and crossed the boards , and then the creak of the spring on the screen door . " Why I got to fight for everything ? " he said aloud . His wife did not answer . He heard her shuffle the cleaned shrimp in their big iron pot . He rested his head in his hands . The afternoon sun made a long black streak of shadow from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; long strings of spider webs hung straight down from the edge of the porch railing . Pete came back with the bottle of liniment . He put it next to his father on the floor , then went back to the corner of the porch and sat down . Eddie picked up the bottle and held it out at arms ' length , reading the label carefully . " That 's it , ai n't it ? " the boy asked . Eddie put the bottle down , stretched his back slightly , arching his neck , then bent forward again , elbows on knees . He closed his eyes , but all he could see was the swamp : the edges where the roots and grasses came and disappeared into the water . He 'd looked at miles of it , carefully , keeping his eyes moving slowly along , the same speed as the boat , looking almost from blade to blade , jumpingeach time a fish broke water or a frog splashed , jumping whenp266a turtle craned its head or a bird squeaked , and hunting all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rubbed the back of his neck . He was getting old , for sure . Or he would n't be so tired . Behind his closed lids , the grasses kept slipping past , one reed after the other . He shook his head and opened his eyes : he 'd have to keep awake then . " Get me a drink , " he said . In the pause one of the cats yeowled . Then his wife said : " You want a beer or whisky ? " He tapped his open palms on his knees . " I ai n't said that . I ask for water , me . Plain water out the cistern . " He heard the boy get to his feet . " Why you send him all the time ? " he asked . " Why you ai n't gone to get me something ? " She spat noisily into the side yard . " With my hands smelling from shrimp ? You would n't do nothing but scream louder . " " Okay , " he said . " Okay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door creaked . " Do n't brace it that way , " Belle said . " The house fill up with flies . " When the boy had come back , a couple of minutes later , she said : " I hope you fixing to catch all the bugs you let in . " " Oh sure , " he said , " sure . . . . Here , Pa . " He reached the glass over his shoulder . Eddie took it , started to drink , then stopped , looking at it . " What is the matter now ? " " It ai n't got no ice . " " It ai n't supposed to have none , " she said . " You too hot for it to be good for you . " " Since when you know what good for me ? " She tossed a whole shrimp down into the yard and bent over the rail to watch the cats fight for it . " That little black and white , he a scrapper for sure . " " Where he come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen him before . " She threw another whole shrimp , high this time . The cat leaped after it , arching his small body , and missed . She laughed shortly , a snort , more.  | " You throwing away good shrimp there , " Eddie said . " I know it , me . " " You losing your head to be throwing out shrimp . " " It ai n't all I 'm losing . " Eddie opened his mouth to answer , but heard someone walking around the house . So he just rested his chin on his hands and stared straight ahead . Story LeBlanc came and put one foot on the bottom step . He held a duck in each hand , cleaned and pink . " I come on these this morning , " he said . Eddie closed one eye and looked at them . " They look fine , for sure . " " Man , " Story said , " there ai n't nobody on this here island like duck much as you . " " Well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact , me . " " Sure . . . ai n't nobody . " " They out of season , " Pete said , from his crouching position in the corner of the porch . Story grinned : the front teeth were missing . His tongue rubbed back and forth , very quickly , fluttering in the opening . " And who going to tell the government ? " " I did n't say nothing like that , " Pete said . " I just said they was out of season . " " These here was two of the prettiest pintails I never did see . " Story put them on the railing . They hung over the wood bar , drippinga little blood . The cats circled around , their eyes big and flat . " They going to get them , " Pete said and giggled , like a girl ; his voice was still changing . " Not while I 'm sitting here , " Eddie said . " Man , " Story said , " I never did see a man like duck much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe . . . it is good , for sure . " " So I give it to you . The both of them . Because you enjoy it most . " Belle flipped the last of the shells into the yard and got to her feet , carrying the half-full kettle . She snorted loudly . " Lose his son , and he get him a pair of duck . " She slammed the screen after her . They could hear her in the kitchen , banging the pots around.  |p268Eddie  did not move . He sat staring straight ahead . Story started to say something , then changed his mind , and stood with his mouth open , the tip of his tongue just sticking through the hole in his teeth . Pete got to his feet , swung over the railing and , almost without a sound , dropped to the ground . One of the cats jumped up to the porch and crouched , tail over nose , eying the ducks . Eddie said : " They look real fat . " " They was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty , for sure . " Inside they could hear her begin to sing : " Mary Mother , pray for me " You know , " Eddie said , and he rested his chin on his hands , " you know I done everything . " Story nodded . " Sure , " he said . " Kept going out there , until I could n't stand it no more . " " Sure , " Story said . " Any farther , I 'd got lost too , and not come out . " " I know that , me . " " And she know that . She know it like any of us . " " See you , " Story said and walked around the corner of the house . " She know that , " Eddie said to the cats . They sat and looked at him , the tips of their tails twitching . " She got to know that . " A mockingbird came down and sat on the edge of the roof , squaaking . Eddie lifted one eye and squinted sidewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The bird hopped up and down , sliding along the gutter . Eddie got to his feet , very slowly , and stood for a minute lookingout across the back yard , hitching up his pants , tightening the belt . He 'd knocked the bottle of liniment over , but he did n't stop or notice or look down . He turned and opened the screen door , then stepped back again and grabbed the ducks off the railing . " You ai n't going to get them yet , " he told the cats . He went inside , letting the door slam after him . His wife was right there , on the other side of the small kitchen . He blinked for a few seconds until his eyes got used to being inside . She was chopping up some onions , holding the big heavy blade of the knife in both hands.  |p269He  walked over and put the ducks in the sink . She did not say anything . " Could n't do nothing more , " he said . She did not lift her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even find his boy 's dead body . " " You know why . " " Comes walking in here , bringing some dead birds with him . " " I hunt until I could n't stand up no more . " " Do n't come crying to me . " He flopped the ducks in the sink . " It ai n't my job , to go find him . " " I done tried . " " I drop down dead , before I come back with no sign , me . " " Leave the shrimp alone , " he said , and wiped his bloody handson the seat of his pants , " and let 's us have the duck tonight . " " You want a party too ? " He stared at her , his head bent very slightly , and wobbling just a little bit on his neck . " I 'm glad I 'm bushed out , " he said . " I 'm right glad . " She kept chopping the onions , short even movements . " Or I twist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and with the flat of her hand swept the onions from the board into the pan . " Talking , " she said , " seems like that all you can do . " " No , " he said . " Now you go round thinking about food , like nothing happen . " " I know something happened , me , only I do n't see no reason to starve to death . " She hissed at him , between her teeth . " We going to eat them duck tonight . " He walked out of the house , and she shouted at him from the window . The words were so blurred he did not understand . He went down to the Rendezvous , dragged a chair over by the front window , under the fan where it was cooler , and had two beers . " You look green , man , " his cousin Lacy said after a few minutes . " Come here in the back . " Eddie got up , swaying a little on his feet.  | " Man , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scratched his scarred , naked head . " Stretch out there on the bed . " Eddie 's back was hurting him so , from all the steady paddling he 'd done , that he could hardly talk . And he was n't sure which hurt more : lying down straight or sitting up and hunching over . Lacy called his wife , Andree . " Mary Mother ! " she said , " go get a bottle of whisky . " There was a pint bottle on the dresser , next to the picture of the Infant Jesus of Prague . Lacy held it to Eddie 's lips . He swallowed , choked , and began to hiccup . " Pull off his shirt , " Andree said , " and grab some of this stuff . " She poured some liniment in the palm of her hand . While they were working , Perique Lombas came in and began to pound on the top of the bar with his fists , whistling . Lacy Livaudais lifted up his head without stopping what his hands were doing and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money on the counter . I got all I can do back here . " His wife got some towels and wrung them out in boiling-hot water and put them still steaming on Eddie 's back and chest . When Lacy finally went back in the bar , his face was bright red and dripping with sweat . Perique was still there , with two empty bottles on the counter . " Jesus Christ , " Lacy said and tried to wipe his face on his shirtsleeve . " Now who you got back there ? " " Eddie . " Perique whistled softly . " I seen him when he come back . " " Lacy , hey . " His wife stuck her head through the screen door . " Come here quick and talk to your cousin . " Eddie was sitting on the edge of the bed , swaying back and forth a little . They had taken his shoes off when they put him on the bed , and he was trying to find those shoes now : he swung his feet in big uncertain circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to get my shoes , " he said , but the words did n't come out clearly . Perique had followed Lacy . He stood just inside the screen door that led from the bar to the Livaudais 's bedroom and kitchen . Eddie saw them , and blinked his eyes rapidly . " Perique , boy , " he said , and lifted up one hand to point at him , " I got to go out again and hunt ... you going to come help me , no ? "  | " Sure , " Perique said , " I come with you . " Eddie 's head was so heavy he had trouble keeping it straight . It kept falling to one shoulder or the other . " I ai n't going to ask Lacy here , account he too old . Do n't want no old men . " " Sure , " Perique said . " They get tired out too quick . " " Listen at him , " Lacy said , " him talking about the dos gris . " " Shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hissed . " You got to be young and tough . If I was n't so old I could found him . " Eddie stopped moving his feet around . He stared at Perique and his eyes were big and almost round . You could see the long red strain lines at the corners , deep almost as cuts . " You coming , Perique man , no ? " " I said I was coming , me . " Perique swung the screen door back and forth . " When you want to go ? " Eddie stopped moving and sat very still . " I do n't know , me . " " Do n't know when you want to go ? " " Ought to get some sleep first , maybe . " " Sure , " Lacy said , " you ca n't tell what you doing without that you got some sleep . " " Look , man , " Perique closed the screen behind him and came one step farther into the room . " You go get some sleep and I go get everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Eddie said . " Not just us . " " Okay , " Perique said . " I go find them . Who you want ? " Eddie fell asleep sitting there , sitting straight up on the edge of the bed , with his head resting over on one shoulder . They tipped him over , very slowly , until his head was on the pillow ; then they picked up his feet and stretched him out . His mouth fell open and he began to snore . They tiptoed out , closing the wood door behind them . " Man , " Andree said with a sigh , " man , man , man . " " You ai n't serious about going out with him , no ? " Lacy said to Perique . " If he say so . " " In the morning , when he wake up , he going to see that ai n't no good , " Andree said . " It be just for nothing . " " Maybe he still want to do it , " Perique said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't reckon he is , " Perique said . " I sure do n't want to be in his place , when he comes to waking up . " He slept only a couple of hours , until about five o'clock . They were n't sure what woke him . Maybe somebody slammed the front screen door , or maybe a kid yelled under the window . Or maybe it was his own dreams . Andree had looked in at him once , when he 'd been asleep about an hour . ( She got the idea , somehow , that he might have just stopped breathing , lying there on her bed . ) He was sleeping heavily , muttering a little and his shoulder was twitching . She said when she 'd tiptoed away : " He is still paddling , him . " After a couple of hours he sat up , with his eyes swollen and half closed so that it was hard for him to see . He got down on his hands and knees and found his shoes . The strings were knotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he stuck his toes in , slipper fashion . The canvas heels flattened easily under his weight . He did not go through the main part of the bar . He hesitated for just a minute in the center of the room , then went out the side door , quietly . The screen had a heavy spring on it . It got away from his clumsy fingers and slammed . He blinked at the sudden sharp noise , but he did not turn or stop . He kept walking , down the little path , in the direction of home . The shoes dragged along the ground . Behind him he heard Andree 's sharp voice : " He ai n't here . He done gone out the side door , him . " And then she was right alongside him , panting a little with the sudden run  --  she was n't young any more , for all that she had the thin figure of a teenager . " Why you ai n't sleeping ? " She had hold of his arm . " Why you go running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept walking . She kept pace with him . " You come back and I give you some supper . I got some real fine shrimp , me . " He looked at her slowly through his puffy lids . The skin on his cheeks and chin was beginning to turn bright red and crack from the sun . " Belle , she got some shrimp , too . "  | " We got good cold beer , man , " she said . " And that go with shrimp for sure . " " I got to get home , " he said . " Wait and put you shoes on straight . " There was a mockingbird right over them , screaming and diving at their heads . She waved her hand at it . " Rest a minute . " He did not answer . She kept running alongside him , with her quick little nervous steps . " Come take a cup of coffee with us , no ? " He ducked his head and kept on moving . Her legs stopped makingtheir quick pecking little movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered to herself . He kept walking , listening to the little white bits of shell grind away from under his feet . It was beginning to get cooler  --  just a little  --  and the wind had dropped . It must be about five o'clock . Shadows were criss-crossing the shell path ; he walked over them . It took him such a long time to get home . He was surprised how slow he 'd been walking . There was a cat sitting on the edge of the path , sitting , tail curled over feet , one paw combing bits of cobwebs out of its whiskers . A yellow cat , with yellow eyes and white whiskers . He wondered if they had got his duck : they slipped in the house sometimes . He kicked at the cat and sent it yeowling away . His shoe fell off . He started to bend to pick it up : he was too stiff . His back ached just bending a little way over . He slipped the shoe on , without looking . Some of the shell had got inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate ; it swung crookedly from one hinge . Henry had been promising to fix that since the winter . Only he 'd never got to it . Eddie swung the gate back and forth , listening to the scraping sound . He would have to fix it , or get Pete to do something . They 'd be a lot of things Pete 'd have to do now , that he had n't before . Eddie closed the gate carefully . The small white dog came and smelled around his flapping shoes . " Get away . " There was the gray shell of a shrimp right there by the front walk : one of the cats must have carried it . He crouched downp274slowly and painfully and picked it up . He turned it over and over , just a piece of shell , slightly curved . He tossed it over his shoulder . His wife said from the porch : " Supper is fixed , if you want it . " He looked up slowly : he had n't noticed her . She was n't doing anything  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was just sitting there , rocking slightly in the cane chair . " I do n't want nothing , " he said . He started up the steps , very slowly , putting both feet on each one . He crossed the porch and opened the screen , letting it slam behind him . The house was full of the odor of duck cooking . He sat down in the big armchair in the living-room , put his elbows on his knees and rested his head in his hands . It was so quiet all he could hear was the creak of the rocker on the front porch.  |p275C  E C I L E B O U D R E A U had been crabbing . It had taken hours  --  the crabs were n't biting  --  and her head was swimming with the heat . Under the very first tree that was big enough to give shade  --  the small oleander bushes were n't much use in a sun like this  --  she stopped and squinted out over the bay to the marsh , to the shifting grasses and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not half an hour ago , hunched over and leaning so hard on his paddle that it seemed he 'd go overboardeach stroke . And she could tell by the way he held himself that he had n't found the slightest sign and that he was n't going to look anymore  --  that he was beat . The shells of the crabs rustled together and the basket shook . She 'd have to be getting them home before they ate each other up . But she did n't feel like hurrying , not today . She sat down instead . The ground was hot through her cotton shorts . She reached out one hand and patted the brown burned grass . She picked up a shell and tossed it over her shoulder . She heard it snap against the trunk of another tree and then fall . A couple of gulls passed overhead , squaaking and fighting . Then it was very quiet , even the dust still under the heat from the sun . She rubbed her eyes slowly . The basket shook . She sat up took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistled , four short sounds . Then she leaned back , fanning herself , and waited . The close-clipped black head of her son peeped around one of the chinaberry trees . She saw him , winked . He made two enormous one-legged hops and landed behind her . " Don , boy , " she said , " take that basket home , che ' . " Flat on his stomach on the grass he squirmed over to the basket and lifted the cover . " Put that down , " she said.  |p276He  hesitated , his hand raised , ready to reach in . " They going to take a piece out your fingers . " She stood up , looked briefly at the bluish shells and put the cover back on . " Now take this home , bougre , before I got to lay my hand to your rear end . " When he had gone she still hesitated , putting the hat back on her head , patting it slowly in place with her palms , and looking out across the back bay . The sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wind at all  --  the water was flat and reflecting like a mirror , it was hard to see the grasses on the other side . She gave the hat a final pat , tipping it forward over her eyes and started home , shaking her head just slightly . Her father was standing on the front porch of the store . She waved and then went over to him . Without getting up , Julius Arcenaux hooked a toe over another rocking-chair and pulled it toward her . " Sit down , Cecile che ' , and pass some talk with the old man . " She sat down and gave herself a little flipping rock . " I been crabbing . " " So , " he said and scratched the top of his bare head . " You been lucky ? " " Enough . " she paused , looking down at her own hands , that were picking at the splintered cane of the chair seat . " Only I could n't help wondering . Sitting there , you begin to wonder . " Her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his hands . " Henry , no ? " A big yellow tomcat crossed the edge of the porch . He had a bird in his teeth . " I seen his papa come back . " " I heard tell about that . " " And he was nothing but a kid . " Julius picked up the cigar and lit it again . " He ai n't much younger than you . " She looked away , down the shell path , toward her own house , out of sight there , behind the oaks and the oleanders and the summerhibiscus . " I reckon , " she said , " only with kids you feel older . " He puffed hard on his cigar , making the tobacco gurgle.  | " Maybe I just plain feel old . " Perique and Therese came by , waved but did not stop . Julius nodded after them . " Perique now , he seem to get over losing his girl quick . " Cecile looked after them . " Annie did n't ever like him much . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she like him better when she do n't have him . " " You think he sleeping with Therese ? " Julius shrugged . " You think he sleeping with Annie ? " " How I know that ? " " I seen Inky out washing the covers one Sunday morning . " " You do n't know nothing , " Cecile said . " Maybe , " Julius said . " Only Annie got herself another man , andPerique got himself another girl . And everybody is happy . " Cecile stood up and stared along the path , back the way shehad come . " And Henry , " she said , " it do n't change anything . " " Some , " Julius said . " Except maybe for his family , everything keep going like he never was here . " Julius scratched his cheek . " Ca n't go stopping , " he said . " Just one crazy kid . " " Get all upset , and then we forget it . . .. And he ai n't even buried here to remind nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change my shirt , " he said . " Wringing wet . " She heard him cross the store and then heard him talking briefly to her mother back in the living-quarters . She walked around the building , outside . " Tell Mama I be back . " She remembered all of a sudden that she had sent Don home with the basket of crabs . " I got to go look at something back home . " She trotted off : the weight of her swinging breasts was almost distasteful to her in the heat . She was up the steps in two hard jumps that shook the house and woke Hector who was dozing , a newspaper over his face , in the shady corner of the porch . " Hey , " he said . She stopped with the screen door open in her hand . " Ai n't seen you . " She let the door slam shut and went over to perch on the rail by him.  | " To look at you , " he said , " you think the whole island was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry ? " " I hear Eddie come back . " " Did n't find anything . " " You expect he was going to ? " Hector asked quietly . Cecile sat down . She took off her straw hat and rubbed a hand across her neck . The back of her head was tingling : she 'd had too much sun , she thought . It came through a hat , even . She 'd have to be more careful , and maybe put a handkerchief inside . " You not getting sunstroke ? " She shook her head , and her ears buzzed . " Don come home with some crabs . " " I told him put the basket in the kitchen . " " You know , " Hector said , " you ca n't take the sun like you used to . You look groggy . " " No , " she said . " I got to put the water on , if those crabs going to be done by suppertime . " " I get it , me , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I lift it before , " she said , " and I reckon I can lift it again . " " Quit , " he said , " I plain said I do it . " " Maybe I better go see if the kid left the cover on tight . " " If we got to chase crabs all over this here house , " Hector said , " I 'm gon na warm his tail for good . " He filled the big tub and put it on the stove . Then he sauntered down the steps , stopping to pat the big black dog whose name was Grandpa . " Reckon I get back to work , " he said . She nodded . When the water finally began to boil she dumped in the crabs . And then began to wash the dishes she 'd left from breakfast , workingslowly in the water that was left in the dishpan from that morning . She did not think of heating it , though she had to rub the plates harder to clean them in the cold water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted the cover and looked at the crabs : they were still now and turning bright red . Good fat ones , she thought . The afternoon sun made the house stifling , even with the shuttersall closed on the west side.  |p279She  put some of the baby 's diapers to soak in the big galvanized tub in the back yard and lit the little charcoal pot under them . Outside she felt better ; there were thin streaks of shade from the oleander bushes and there was a little breeze moving . She pulled a sprig of parsley from the little plot by the side of the house and chewed on it . The clear , almost peppery green taste made her mouth feel cooler . She pulled the last of the oleander flowers and stuck them in her hair . She started up the back stairs , but turned and came down again when she smelled the close hot odor of the house . She stood quiet for a minute , thinking , then turned and cut through the oleander bushes . She put her hand to her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside . " I can stay most in the shade , me , " she told herself aloud . And she circled slightly to stay in the shade of the oaks . The kids were n't out playing , though there 'd usually be half a dozen of them whoopingand yelling back in here . The ground was smooth and sandy under the thick shade . You could see where they used to play : the deep hopscotch marks and over there , a little farther , the small baseball diamond , a circle of oyster shells to mark each base . Maybe it was too hot for the kids too . Or maybe it was something else , she thought . She kept going , passing the LeBlanc place . Somebody waved from the window ; she waved back but did not stop . " I 'm going to fetch the kid from Mama , " she called to explain . A yellow and white dog lifted his head to peer at her with yelloweyes . He started to bark , changed his mind , and stretched out again . Cecile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ripped off an oak . The winds had dug it deep in the earth , and so it was rooting now , with tall feathery green shoots . Cecile hurried ; she was more tired than she had thought . She 'd been silly to stay so long in the sun . Hector was right , though it would never do to tell him , she thought . She wondered if her mother would have a coke in the icebox . There 'd be coffee for sure , there always was a pot on the back of the stove ; but she did n't want anything hot . And her mother was too old-fashioned to stand for her putting ice in hers . She ducked between some blueberry bushes , and stopped , herp280mouth open in surprise . She had not expected to find anyone . Annie Landry was stretched out full length on the ground , face up , her hands behind her head . Her hair was tied back in a bandanna , and there was cold cream on her face , and little packs of cotton over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to three littleblue jars , a small portable radio was playing softly . Annie sat up , suddenly , surprised and scowling . " So this where you hide out all day long . " Annie smiled with one corner of her mouth . " Now I reckon I got to find another place . " She reached up and shut off the radio . " Where you get that ? " Cecile pointed . " Borrowed it . " " Who from ? " " Layovers to catch meddlers . " " Bet I know , " Cecile said . " Bet his name is Inky . " Annie shrugged . " And this here is where you been coming , and we do n't see you around no more . " Annie began to brush the little bits of grass off her back . " What you find to do ? " " Nothing . " " Come on , " Cecile said , smiling . " I ai n't goin ' to bite you or tell anybody . . . what you do ? " " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio . " " Think . " " About Inky , I bet . " " No . " Cecile bent and pulled up one of the long thin grasses and stuck it between her teeth , sucking . " Always did like the taste of these things , here . " " Yea , " Annie said . " Always taste sort of good  --  green and tart . You would n't think eating grass would be so fine . " " I would n't think nothing , " Annie said . " Oh lord , lord , " Cecile said with a grin , " if you ai n't in the lousiesthumor this day here . " Annie did not answer . She concentrated on a little piece of dirtp281under her fingernail . She fished in her pocket and took out a pocket knife . " You know , " Cecile said , " when I was a kid , we used to come here too . " Annie did not answer or move . " And you know , Mamere Terrebonne . . . that old woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to come here , too . Ai n't that something ? " Annie looked up . " Here ? You come here ? " " Oh sure , " Cecile said , and waved out her hands . " Only I forgot about it , it been so long ago . . . or anyhow it seem that way . " " And what you do ? " " Oh nothing very much . . . we did n't have a radio , like you . We just sort of come and hid out . " " Right here ? " " Sure , " Cecile said . " You had to pull aside the oleanders and then slip through quick , before they snapped back together . They grow in a circle around here , almost like somebody planted them . . . but they were thicker when I was coming here . There was a freeze once , I remember , that burned them out . " " I like it , " Annie said , " because its the one and only place where you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cecile said . " Today 's been real quiet anyhow . " " I reckon , " Cecile said , " they do n't feel like yelling and horsingaround with the news about Henry . " Annie began to rub the cream off her face . " You think he 'd have better sense than to go getting so far in he could n't find his way out . " " I do n't reckon he intended to go get lost . " Cecile sucked the piece of grass in and out of her mouth , thinking . " He was the ugliest guy , " Annie said , " long , with big old saucersunder his cheeks and pimples all over his chin that 'd all bleed when he tried to shave . " " Look , " Cecile said , and she threw down the little weed she 'd been chewing , " nobody asked you . " Annie did not answer or move . Cecile turned to push aside the bushes . " You said what youp282think . . . . But just quit screaming . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . Her mother had the baby out on the front porch , in the little cradle they had all used when they were that size too , and she was rocking it slowly with her foot  --  one nudge to the cradle for every two rocks of her own rocking-chair . Cecile swung astride the porch rail and sat there , grinning . " You just ought to have some more kids , Ma , you like them all that much . " Her mother laughed , the soundless wheezing , and her three chins bobbed up and down , one against the other . " Been a long time since I could have a kid , me . " " I do n't know , " Cecile said . " Do n't go laughing at me . I am an old woman , for sure . " " Take one of my kids . " " Sure . . . if you are willing to let them go , I will take him , this one right here . " Her mother was so fat , the least little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . Just standing up and bending down to the baby 's crib and clucking her lips in the sleeping face  --  and she had to wipe her face off with the handkerchief she carried in her bosom . Cecile said : " You heard about Eddie coming back , no ? " " Sure , " her mother said , and slipped the handkerchief inside the top of her dress and wiped around . " You got a coke , Mama ? " " There is coffee on the stove . " Cecile grinned . " Now what is so funny ? " " Mama . . . you 'd have coffee on the stove if the whole place was blowing over with a hurricane . " Her small mouth grinned in its heavy fat cheeks . " Maybe that be the time you want some most , no ? " Cecile threw up her hands . " I give up , " she said . " You want me to get you some coffee , when I get mine ? " " If you are going back there ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you some . " Cecile walked back through the house that had not changedp283since she was a child . Even the bunch of yellow straw flowers in front of the picture of the Sacred Heart was the same . She poured the two cups of coffee , put three teaspoons of sugar in each of them . She stopped a minute to admire the new washing-machine . Maybe , she thought , her father chased the girls , but he was good to his wife too . There were n't many people on the island could afforda machine like that . She brought the cups to the porch . " That is sure a pretty machine , Mama . You still like the way it works ? " Her mother 's eyes slanted a little , the way they did each time she thought about her husband . " At my age it is a great pleasure . " Cecile patted her mother 's shoulder . " Stop talking like you an old decrepit woman . " " I am old , " her mother said . " You the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got  --  they growing up and pushingme into the cemetery . " " Mama , you do n't feel good , or you ai n't started off talking this way . " The woman sighed , a hissing wheezing sigh . " You get heavy sometimes and tired of living . " Cecile threw back her head and laughed , loud , so that the birds in the chinaberry tree started up , leaving a flurry of feathers driftingto the ground . " If you ai n't the darndest one . . . . Now I plain know you do n't mean that . " The woman looked hurt . She began to fan herself more rapidly . " You think they ever going to find Henry ? " " No . " " Well . . . " Cecile was silent , staring down at the coffee cup and the brown stain around the rim . Her mother tapped the fan gently on the tip of her nose . " I seen it before . " She finished the last bit of coffee and rested the cup on her thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I seen it before , more than I remember , me . " It was funny , Cecile thought , talking to her mother she could hardly wait to get away . But when she got home , she could think back and remember her with affection , tenderness even . Her mother repeated : " More times I seen this . " Cecile nodded . " I reckon you are right . " She picked up the baby , 284 THE HARD BLUE SKY : who gave a single sleepy cry . " I left supper sitting on the stove , me . " " You do n't want no more coffee ? " Cecile shook her head . " I ai n't got the time now . " She picked up the cradle in her free hand . " Just leave that be , " her mother said . " I will take it in when I go . " " I can set it inside . " " I am not that old , " her mother said . " Okay , " Cecile said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her mother patted her forehead with the fan . " I got no need for crabs . " " They look like good fat ones . " " Your papa , he always bring plenty food to the house . " " I did n't mean anything like that , " Cecile said , " and you know it . " " If you got any left , " her mother said , still tapping the forehead with the corded edge of the fan , " you make gumbo , hear ? " " Sure , " Cecile said , " I can always use them . " " So do n't be giving them away . " " I 'll be darned , " Cecile pointed to one of the little banana trees , " you got some bananas . " Her mother wrinkled her nose . " I done tried one of them yester-day . " " What 's wrong with them ? " " They do n't taste like nothing . They ripe but they do n't have no taste . " The baby burped on Cecile 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingers and grinned at the little pinched face . " I ai n't got a single shirt that do n't smell sour from you . " She looked up at her mother and was astonished to see what a perfect pyramid her figure was : the enormous legs , the heavy hips that hung over the rocker like folds of cloth , the enormous breasts like a solid shelf ( she had rested the coffee cup there , while her hands were folded on her stomach ) and the small head with its tight , high knot of hair . " Seems like he know when I got a clean shirt on , " Cecile said . " He go and spit all over it . Keeps me washing . " Her mother said : " Bring the stuff over here and use the ma/chine . It do n't get used enough as it is . " The cup perched on her bosom vibrated with each word . Cecile hefted the baby to her other hip . " Maybe I will , " she said , " but I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not go home . Her legs felt cramped and tingling . She began to walk , using a long , slow loping stride that made the little shells of the path rattle off behind her feet . She kept going until she got to the little shell ridge at the north edge of the island . She scrambled up through the long tough grasses and then sat down , cross-legged , at the top . A couple of mosquitoes sang around her legs but did not bite . She waved her hands limply at them . The baby burped again , this time down his chin and on his own shirt . " Miss me this time , " she told him . " This time you got you own self dirty . " She settled him on her lap and looked around . Behind her was the island . From this angle you could n't see any of the houses : just trees and bushes , green-brown in color , all burned by the salt spray , and all twisted and stunted by the wind . Ahead of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not more than a couple of hundred feet of grasses ; beyond them was the bay . She squinted as she looked out across it . There was a boat over there , coming in . It was too far away to see clearly . A big red ant crawled over her toe and she flicked it away . She leaned back on her hands so that the grass prickled her palms . And she tipped back her head until she was staring straight up into the sky , the hard blue sky , whitened a little by the sun . She stared at it , thinking how hard and solid it looked , like a blue cup put over the ground . By tilting her head way back she could see the thunderheads that sat on the rim of the Gulf , black heaps with little lightning flickers . They seemed to stay there  --  never coming closer  --  day and night . She sat up straight again , rubbing her eyes : the bright light had hurt them . When she was little , very little , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds : the same face , which she knew was God 's . Sometimes she 'd lain flat on her back staring up into a clear sky , staring at one patch , staring and staring , trying to make her eyes reach through the solid blue and see what was behind it.  |p286And  sometimes when she had reached through a great distance she would catch just a glimpse of that face , before it vanished a thousandmiles ahead . She stared off across the bay at the fringe of salt marsh , and just barely in sight beyond that , the swamp . And she thought of Henry Livaudais , and how he had nothing to look at but alligator grass and salt cane and oyster grass and cattails waving in the wind . And how there were mosquitoes that came in clouds and moccasinsthat swam through the water without a sound . And the sour-sweet odor was so strong it made you dizzy . And she thought how Henry had seen all these things and how he was seeing them now  --  in the hot bright sun . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her feet . Her sudden movement woke the baby , who began to cry , short peevish wails . Cecile did not notice . She stood , trembling slightly , turning her head from side to side , looking first across the bay and then over the island . And then she lifted her head and stared straight up in the sky : it was clear and empty and flat . Hearing the baby for the first time , she stopped and picked him up . His cries trailed off to hiccups . " I ai n't going to let you go out alone , " she said , " no matter how much you want to . Not as long as I can stop you . " A big brown pelican flew clumsily across the sky and landed with a splash on the bay . A couple of mockingbirds squawked and fought in the twisted limbs of the chinaberry . " He ai n't coming back , " Cecile said slowly . " He 's dead right now . And nobody can find him  --  except the gars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder and patted him gently . She went on whispering to herself . " It do n't matter why . It end with the gars working on him . " Her lip began to tremble . She rubbed the back of her hand against it hard as she could . " It do n't matter that we get caught and die , us . " The baby gurgled and burped and began to cry again . The lugger was closer now : she could make it out : the Belle Helene . She watched the little white bow wave . " It do n't even matter that we been alive . " The baby was wailing steadily now . She swung on her heel in ap287circle , squinting as far as she could in all directions . Her jaw was trembling and she was beginning to cry . The tears were running down the side of her nose and putting their salt taste in her mouth . " Damn , " she said , " damn , damn , damn . " With the tears she could n't see clearly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scream . She bent down and searched until she found the largest rock around : a half-brick . She rubbed her eyes against her shoulder . " Damn , damn . " She threw the brick hard as she could , at the sky , then turned and ran home , not waiting to see it fall.  |p288AFTER  that week-end everybody went back to work . When he was unloading at Petit Prairie , Hector met three men from New Orleans . They chartered his boat right then and there . He charged them nearly twice what he could have made fishing . That was what the rest of the island called Boudreau luck . But they were n't starving either , just then . It was almost as if Henry 's death had brought good luck to the island  --  but people did n't let themselves think of that . And there were things happening ; there always were . Robby Livaudais fell out of a tree behind the LeBlanc house and twisted his ankle and broke three fingers of his left hand . And Stanley Bechet was cleaning out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing that ; at the end of the summer half the cisternswere stone-dry ) when he thought he 'd have a look at his second cistern , to see just how much water there was left and how clean it was . He took the cover off , to let the sun in a little . And he fell in . He was n't quite sure what happened himself . Only he nearly drowned before anybody found him , for the water was so low he could n't reach the top to pull himself out , but it was deep enough to be over his head . And this small cistern had no ladder nailed to the inside . So he yelled and treaded and stared at the small wigglers that scooted like lightning through the water . Itp289was an hour before anybody found him , and he was getting pretty tired by then . They got the cisterns scrubbed out just in time too . A couple of afternoons later the thunderheads moved over and dumped a couple of inches of water into them . And during the lightning one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom so that there was a smell of burning all over the island . By the next morning the sun came up bright and hot again and the wet ground and leaves steamed away until they were bone-dry . The day after this storm Inky was running up his main  --  to let it dry  --  when his fingers slipped off the winch handle . He 'd forgot to put on the brake too  --  he was just careless that day , all around . The winch spun free , the sail dropped  --  the halyard ran in evenly and did not jam  --  the handle , whirling around , slipped off its pin . It missed Inky 's jaw by a fraction of an inch and whirled in a long arc down the dock , smacking finally into Perique 's leg and knocking him down flat on the Hula Girl 's deck . That was a day 's excitement . They thought at first his leg was broken . But after a couple of hours of hot towels the pain was mostly gone . By the next morning there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they put a couple of leeches to it . But that one night , Inky drank coffee and stayed awake , his revolverclose at hand . Annie laughed at him . " Nobody going to think it 's deliberate , " she said . And they did n't . But Inky was not sure . And he did n't want to take any chances . The next morning Inky went down and called Arthur in New Orleans , while the grocery listened . And explained what had happened to him . Two days later there was a check for fifty dollars . Inky brought it over to the Lombas house himself . " Hell , " Perique said , " for this I go do it every day . " His mother looked at the amount and then shook her head . " For a bruise . " " He 's loaded , " Inky said . " Anyhow you could sued him . " That was the end of that . Except that Perique stayed home for four solid days , sitting on his front porch with his leg propped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ferd Lombas said , was real tough living . Another thing the island took calmly  --  the way Annie slippedp290down to the Pixie every night . They hardly noticed any more . And they did n't even talk . Annie ate supper at home , early and by herself . Sometimes Inky came and stood at the front gate waiting ( he never came in , though Adele had once or twice asked him : Annie had made him promise not to ) . Sometimes they met down at the Rendezvous . And sometimes she went down directly to the boat . Annie was almost never in the house any more , except to sleep . And whenever she went out she carried a large pad of white paper and a couple of pencils stuck over her ear . Al asked about that once . " I 'm learning to draw , " she said . " Inky , he 's teaching me . " And when he insisted , she showed her sketches  --  some were of the island , the twisted oaks and the palm trees ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the novels she 'd read at the convent : castles perched high up on hills above a river that was broad and smooth as a ribbon , and little houses almost buried under their climbing roses . Al looked at them , and clucked his tongue in admiration , and called for Adele . When Annie tried to gather up the pages quickly he stopped her . " Look at this , che ' , " he said to Adele . " Look what our girl , she is doing . " Annie had to stand quietly by while they went through the pictures again . " And there 's another one , " Adele pointed to a sketch held to the walls with straight pins : a girl 's head . " Did n't notice that , " Al said . " That 's me , " Annie said . " Says who ? " " Inky did that . " Al squinted at it . " Only it do n't look like you . " " Sort of , " Adele said quickly . " Look around the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the pad , walked around them and out the door . That evening Inky said : " Twenty-five pictures at five bucks is over a hundred . " She nodded . " All while I been sitting on this boat . "  |p291She  nodded again . " Funny the money you can make out of a pencil and a couple pieces of paper . " " I wo n't be able to sell mine , " she giggled . " No , " he said , " bet you do n't . " " My old man did n't like the picture you did of me . " " You know what he can go and do . " She just giggled . " Keep your head still . " She was sketching him . She had covered a sheet with small heads , and now she was trying a large one . " I 'd do some more , " he said , " only it 's no fun without a model . " " No , " she said . " You can keep right on sketching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you no . " He got up and turned on the radio , grinning over his shoulder . " You think your papa will find out . " " No . " " Bet that 's it . " " I do n't care what he thinks . " " Then you 're ashamed to have me look at you . " " I do n't care . " " Okay , " he said , " do n't do it , just because I ask you . " He found the station he wanted and turned it on loud . " Do n't do anything I ask you . I do n't need it . " Over the noise of the radio he did n't hear her answer . But he did see her walk over and pull closed the curtains on the land side . The sketches were good , among his best . And he had even got a face that looked like her . When she had gone he sat smoking and looking at them . Boy , he told himself , you would n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunk and sat down on the one across from it . He closed first one eye , then the other , studying . Ought to get more than five bucks for those , he thought . But it was n't likely . It was n't that kind of a business . He snapped off the radio and stretched out on the bunk . The figures watched him . " Too hot down here , " he said aloud and taking a pillow tossedp292it up to the cockpit . He had started to follow it , had one foot on the ladder , when he turned back to the pictures . For the first time he noticed , really noticed , what a good body it was . Legs you 'd see on a calendar . And a pointed behind . But the face now , it was a child 's yet . Well , not a child 's , but a young girl 's . Alone , Inky laughed . Imagine Annie , now , little Annie , looking as seductive as Eve herself . He went up to the cockpit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stretched out . But for the first time , for the very first time , he could n't get her out of his mind . Once he even got up to lean down the hatch and shine a flashlight on the pictures to see if he 'd remembered correctly . Annie , undressed , undressing , raced through behind his closed eyes until he finally fell asleep . In the morning he gathered up the pictures . Maybe , he thought , he would n't sell these . Maybe just these , he would keep for himself . He could do others . All day long he was quite irritated , though he could n't figure out why . And then one Friday night , when he and Annie were down at the Rendezvous ( it was still early and there were n't many people yet ) , Perique and Therese came in . They just waved and went to stand at the bar . Inky found himself staring at their backs , at the tall thin figure of Perique in its faded jeans , at Therese in jeans too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A good figure all right , heavy hips , heavy breasts and a small waist in between  --  she did n't look as bad in pants as you 'd thought . The sort of figure a guy 'd gone nuts about fifty years ago , but it did n't do so well right now , Inky thought . Then , as he watched , he saw Perique 's arm slip around that waist , and his hand come to rest lightly on the broad hip . Alongside him Inky felt Annie stiffen . And he sat back in his own chair , surprised : she was jealous . He was almost sure of that . " You want him back ? " he said in a whisper . Annie jumped  --  like she 'd been slapped , almost  --  and yanked her eyes back.  | " You can go see about getting him back , " Inky said , " when I 'm gone . " Before he knew quite what had happened , he was furiously angry . He sulked all evening , until Annie went home very early , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said silently to the empty cabin as he gathered up the empty paper cups and the cigarette butts to toss them into the bay . She 'll be back . And if she is n't , he thought , and then pushed that answer away . . . . She 'd be back.  |p294WEST  of Isle aux Chiens , over a mile of shallow water , speckled here and there with tufts of weeds and filled with whitecaps at the slightest breeze , is Terre Haute . A small island , not quite two miles long , a ridge of shells sticking up like a turtle 's back , and covered thick with little oak trees and hackberries and oleanders . Thirty or forty people live there , in tight little unpainted houses under the trees , people with names like Svboda and Tortorich and Pivach . They are oystermen , all of them ; they keep the boats at a little dock behind the island . On a Saturday night , when they are drinking , you can hear them over on the nearest point of Isle aux Chiens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hear the accordians and the singing , so clearly that you could make out the words , if you knew the language . Kids sometimes memorizethe sounds and yell them back across the pass . And once the people from the other island got so mad that they sent out a skiff  --  with an outboard  --  and a couple of men with shotguns . But they had n't dared come close enough , they 'd just gone cruising up and down in the pass , cursing . And finally they 'd pointed the shotguns to the island and pulled the triggers . The shot spattered down in the water . The kids , who had n't moved  --  they knew the range of a shotgun  --  hissed and laughed and yelled : " Sal bougrela ! " And sometimes there would be fights at Petit Prairie when both groups went in for a big week-end . It was after one of these , not three years past , that the icehouse at Isle aux Chiens burned down . And there were those who said they saw a pirogue moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes kids from Isle aux Chiens would go out and , just for the hell of it , churn up the oyster beds or steal some oysters . They 'd come home drenched with sweat and tired as puppies , but they 'd be grinning . And those same kids sometimes would think it fun to dare somebody to sneakp295over to Terre Haute and peep in the windows of the houses and maybe kill a dog or a chicken . And the kids from Terre Haute , they would come over too , when it was a dark night , or a stormy one . They stayed to the western end of the island , pretty much , not daring to come down to the end where there were houses and shotguns . They 'd build big fires on the west beaches with gasoline they 'd brought over and then slip away before the men could get there . Once Yvonne Meynier , who knew better , saw the pirogues coming over , and instead of getting the hell out of there , she 'd slipped behind a clump of hackberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog with them , and the wind was right , it caught her scent in no time at all . They sent her running back without a stitch of clothes on . They took her clothes to Terre Haute and hung them on the outhouses . That was maybe ten years past , and Yvonne Meynier was an old maid . Though she swore they had n't touched her , nobody believed it . And there was n't a man on the island wanted to come after a Yugoslav kid . It went on that way . And during the war , people at Petit Prairie used to grin and say that they had n't heard of a fight with the Germans . The only war they knew about was the one going on across the pass . One thing just led to another , that was all . Hector Boudreau , who was loafing near the chute of the icehouse , pretended not to notice that morning , along toward noon , when Anthony Tortorich , from Terre Haute , edged his outboard up to the wharf at Isle aux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts , made a quick knot , and stepped to the dock . He stretched and hitched up his pants . He was a short man , with a very heavy body and very thin arms and legs . His pants did n't close in front ; he left the top three buttons open and hung them under the curve of his belly by a pair of checked suspenders . But across his chest and his slightly hunched back was the thick band of muscle the old oystermen had  --  from a time when oysters were raked up by hand . He looked around , saw Hector and went slowly over , walking like a potato on toothpicks . " Hey , " he said . Hector turned around . " You tell me where old Livaudais house is ? " " Why ? " Hector said . The old fellow was alone , he could see that . " I got talk to him . "  | " What for ? " " I got talk to him . " " What business you got over here ? " Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he hesitated a minute and then turned to the left . Hector followed right along beside him . Some kids who were playing catch stopped and stared . " Sal cochon ! " Tina Roualt yelled . The old man looked sidewise out of his eyes and spat a yellow stream of tobacco juice down at his feet . Hector said : " You do n't know where the house is at , but you sure going in the right direction . " The old man stopped and turned . " I go all right ? " " You know for god damn sure you are . " " I ai n't come to have fight . " " No , huh ? " Anthony Tortorich shifted his tobacco slightly and sucked on it with a plopping sound . " I am old man . " " What you come for ? " " I want talk with the old Livaudais . " " You keep telling me that . " " I want talk to him . " He began walking again , slowly putting his heels down hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following behind them , at a little distance , giggling and scuffling . Tortorich said softly , almost to himself : " I talk to him about his boy . " Hector stared at the broad hunched back under the faded plaid shirt . He looked at the little puffs of dust the old man 's heels raised . " What you know about the boy ? " Anthony Tortorich turned very slowly ; but this time he keptwalking , speaking over his shoulder . " I want talk with him . " " Okay , " Hector said . " And I hope you ai n't starting nothing . " " I am old , " Tortorich said . " I have my belly full with fighting . " Hector pointed out a house to the left . " The white painted one , there . " They walked together to the gate . Hector called , " Eddie , hey man , come here . "  |p297And  Tortorich planted his elbows on the gate post and called , " Old man Livaudais , I got something say to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then Eddie pushed her aside and stepped out on the porch . " Look who just come here , " Hector called . Eddie came down the steps , scratching his chest slowly through the thin undershirt he wore . His wife followed him . " What you want ? " Eddie said . " I got something say to you . " " Huh ? " Eddie reached inside the undershirt , to scratch better . " He just come in , " Hector said , " and I fetch him here . " " Your boy , " Tortorich wiped the dribble of tobacco from thecorner of his mouth , " he is gone . " Belle was standing without moving a single muscle , her hands folded across her stomach . Tortorich leaned harder on the fence post . The wood creaked lightly . " He know right where you live , " Hector said . Still leaning on the fence post , old Tortorich pushed up the brim of the baseball cap he wore . It was an old cap , stained by sweat and faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold . They kept long lines of them hung over the bar on clotheslines and pinned with clothespins . " Who ? " Eddie said . Tortorich did not answer , he stared off into space , his brown eyes squinting just a little in the glare . He pursed his lips until they stuck straight out . " I got a son . " " So ? " " And he got a girl , name of Niccolene . " " That is a stupid name for a girl , " Belle said . " For sure . " " You can not shut up for nothing , huh ? " Eddie said without turning his head . " And Niccolene does not come home either . " It was so quiet then that they could hear the old man 's heavy wheezing breathing , slow and even . Eddie 's fingers had found a tear in his undershirt ; they were twisting and pulling at it . The sparrows fluttered and squaaked in the mulberry tree . " Belle , hey , " Eddie said , " go get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the porch and carried them out to the front yard . She plunked them down behind Eddie . " There , " she said . Eddie opened the gate , pushed it open wide . Then he took the chairs by the backs and put them down , facing each other , about four feet apart on the shell walk that led to his front door . He sat down in one . Tortorich pushed the baseball cap even farther back on his head , came in the yard and sat down . " You get back in the house , " Eddie said to Belle . She did not even move . She stood behind the chair , hands folded on her stomach , her eyes jumping from one to the other . Hector squatted down on his haunches . " You got ears , you can hear , " Tortorich said , " but you got minds to think ? " The kids came close up to the fence , giggling and kicking at each other . They had long daisy chains around their necks and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d'ici ! " Belle yelled at them . She bent and scooped up a handful of gravel and threw it . They scattered in all directions and disappeared . " Niccolene she does not come back , " Tortorich said . " We find this out . " Loretta had said nothing about her daughter that evening . She went quietly about her business , tending the baby and washing the clothes and cooking . Nick , her husband , was working very hard then in the oyster beds over in Marsh Bayou . He came home so tired that he could hardly lift up his arms or see . And when he had eaten , he wanted nothing more than to lie down on the front porch where the night was a little cooler . She sat alongside him , fanning him with a palmetto leaf . Once she started to tell him about Niccolene , but he fell asleep in the middle of her first sentence . So she left him there on the porch and went to bed herself . And that night her second to the youngest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she saw him there , shaking so hard that his teeth clacked together like an old man who is dying , she wrapped him in a blanket and held him tight in herp299arms . And she forgot everything else . She began to yell for Niccoleneto get out the other blanket and heat some water . Nick went into the little back room to wake the girl . He came out with a hard look on his face , saying : " She ai n't here . " And then Loretta remembered and clapped her hand to her mouth . He lit the stove and got the blanket himself . He did n't ask Loretta anything until nearly an hour later , when the spasm had passed and the boy was asleep again . " I ask you , " he said , " and I still continue to ask you . Niccolene , is she living in this house no more ? " Loretta wiped her hands on the apron she had tied over her nightdress , very slowly . " I have meant to tell you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nick said : " Where she go ? " " She tell me not to say nothing at all . " " Where she go ? " Loretta shook her head . " My heart been aching with her gone and never coming back . " Nick lit his pipe silently . No one had ever seen him angry . " She ai n't coming back ? " " She gone with the boy . " And Loretta bent her head over into her apron and wailed . " What boy ? " Loretta tapped her heels on the floorboards and sobbed . " She gone for good . " " What boy ? " " She meet him at Petit Prairie . And she never say his name . " She ai n't never told you ? " " It ai n't a boy from this place , " Loretta said . Nick 's pipe went out . " One from over there . " He kept turning the black stained pipe in his thick calloused fingers . Finally he put it away . " You see why she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up . " But they ai n't there now , " Loretta said . He leaned against the door frame and waited. p 300 " I know you want to get her back . " His face did not move . " Where they go ? " She shook her head . " Isle aux Chiens , no . She know you come for her there . " " What did she do ? " " Not to the other island . . . but you know the little bayou that is back of there , the one they call the rabbit ? " He nodded . " She meet him there . " " And how she got there ? " Loretta ducked her head . " I ai n't ask her . " Nick squatted down and began to tie the laces of his shoes . " What I could do , " Loretta said , " is nothing . " He finished the knot methodically , stood up and lit a cigarette . " I come back to deal with you . " He went down the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand now . She sat and watched the yellow glow swing back and forth until it passed the bushes and disappeared . Henry was at Rabbit Bayou early . There was a little half-circle in the marsh there , where the bayou drained into the bay . He slipped his pirogue out of sight , backing it in through a passage so narrow the reeds brushed hard on each side of the shell . And he settled down to wait . Niccolene did not come until nearly twelve o'clock . By then the wind was up , and there were small flat pieces of cloud scudding low across the sky . Henry was just beginning to wonder when he heard the distinct crisp sound of a paddle in water . He kept perfectly still until the girl came into the mouth of the bayou . The first thing he recognized was her eyes  --  they were very large and close-set , and the shiny irises looked always as if they were full of tears . She had stopped in the center of the little open space and was turning her pirogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he could hear that even from where he was . Hard going in the wind out there in the bay , he thought . He pushed his way out of the grass . She swung her pirogue over to meet him . " I did n't see nothing . " " You have trouble out there ? "  |p301She  nodded . " I been thinking the wind was coming up . " " Yea , " he said . There was a small sloping bank , a tiny beach not more than four feet wide . They pulled the pirogues up there and put the bundle and the two brown paper bags from hers into Henry 's . Then , together they lifted her pirogue and ran it even higher up the shells . " That ai n't going nowhere , " Henry said . " My old man be fit to tie , and something happen to it . " It do n't matter any more what he do , Henry started to say . But did n't . " His pirogue , now that Niccolene was in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a bit , testing . Finally he shook his head . " We ai n't going out in this . " The mouth of Bayou Verde was a mile north on the circle of the open bay . " So we go the other way , " she said quietly . Up Rabbit Bayou to Timbalier and then along its snaking route until it reached Bayou Verde . " Longer . " " We ai n't that hurried . " " We better not be . " " My old man going to think I gone out fishing when he do n't see me there in the morning . " He nodded and headed the pirogue up Rabbit Bayou . Later that night , when it began to storm they had to stop , and cut back some grass and push the pirogue into the empty spot to steady it a little because the wind was very high . They pulled a tarpaulin over their heads and waited a couple of hours , holding to the heaviest of the reeds to steady the canoe against the stiff wind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bottle whisky there . " She got it and offered it to him first . He took it , surprised as he always was . Girls on Isle aux Chiens , he thought , would have taken a swallow first . But on the other island they did n't . The women did n't even eat with the men . Niccolene had told him that . He took one gulp and handed it back . " Take it easy . " " So cold my insides shivering . " " Scared ? "  |p302She  screwed the top back on the bottle and put it carefully away . " Nothing to be scared of , " she said . The lightning rolled in around them . Even under the heavy tarpaulin they saw each other 's faces clearly in the bluish light . " Do n't worry about it hitting you none , " Henry said . " I 'm feeling real lucky , me . " " I seen lightning before , " she said . They were both silent , only shifting their weight slightly to balance the pirogue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Orleans . " " I told you , " he said , " all I got to know . " It was daylight when they reached the end of Timbalier and turned up Bayou Verde . The sun was just barely up , but it was burning hot already and there were little steaming dazzles of heat mirages on the water ahead . They were both paddling now and the heavy pirogue moved rapidly . The water ran smoothly past a half-inch below its gunwales. ' f hey heard the lugger nearly half an hour before it appeared , heard the thump and bang of its gas engine echo out over the marsh grass . To the right , maybe thirty feet back in the grass away from the bayou , was a little cheniere , a shell ridge , covered with salt-burned slanting oaks , and vines , and palmettos . Without looking behind , without once saying anything , they swung the pirogue 's bow over and threaded through the little passes in the grass until they were behind the cheniere . Then still without saying anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife , cut his way to the top of the cheniere . Henry looked back over his shoulder once to be sure the pirogue was hidden in the grass and saw that Niccolene had come up silently too and was standing at his elbow . He motioned her back . She shook her head . They both peered out at the bayou from under the fringed leaf of a latanier . The lugger went past so close they could read the name on the pack of cigarettes that a man squatting on the deck was holding . The lugger was going full ahead and the grasses on each side shook and quivered with its wake.  | " So , " Henry said finally when it had disappeared around a turn of the bayou and all you could see was the very top of its wheelhouseabove the reeds . " You know who that was ? " " I seen that boat before . " " And whose it is ? " " My uncle . " They were silent for a while . And she said : " Maybe they just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six , " Henry said . " And all of them ai n't happening to go in selling something . " She went back to the pirogue and sat down . Henry followed . " Let 's us eat breakfast , " he said . " No use starving . " They had some sausage and bread and a jar filled with coffee . " She told , " Niccolene said finally , thinking of Loretta . Henry just shrugged . " They going wait in town . " " Yea , " Henry said . If they 'd made the early bus , he thought , the way they planned . If that wind had n't made Niccolene so long coming . If the storm had n't held them up in Bayou Timbalier . If the wind had n't been so high they had to come the long way . . . . " They 's always winds coming up from nowhere this near to September , " he said aloud . " We can sneak in town , " she said . " Sure , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the sausage and wiped her hands on her shirt . " Then we get the bus like we planned . " " Hell , " he said , " they just going to be sitting where that bus stops . " She hesitated a minute and then nodded , sadly . They would . Another lugger went by in the bayou . Henry did not bother getting up this time to look . " More , " he said . Niccolene went up to the top of the cheniere and watched . When she climbed down , she did n't say a word . " We ai n't never going to get in there , " he said . She had picked up a bit of oyster shell and scratched with it on the rough gunwale of the pirogue . " You want to go back ? " " Where ? "  |p304He  jerked his finger south . She looked down at the old oyster shell her fingers held . And she shook her head . " No . " " You can all right . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was so quiet they could hear the stir of the grasses and the little animals out in the marsh and the steady rubbing of the hyacinth bulbs . " We could go to Port Ronquille , " Henry said . " We could wait till dark and go down the bayou again and be across the bay by daylight . And they would n't never think to look for us over on that side . And we just go on up Bayou Maringouin to Port Ronquille pretty as we please . " Niccolene tossed the shell from hand to hand . " Except for the wind , maybe . " He squinted up into the clear sky . The wind was still high . " Blow for three or four days , times . " She nodded . The heavily laden pirogue would never make it . Even the lightest one would be too risky now . The onshore wind would have kicked up little breakers . And they would have to cross the bay and skirt along the edge of the open Gulf , broadside to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the place where Bayou Maringouin emptied into the Gulf . " We do n't got to go out in the open , " he said finally , " we go up through the marsh just behind the bay . " She still played with the shell . " They 's oyster beds back in there , " she reminded him , " and nothing but grass around . Somebody'ssure to be working around and we going to get seen . " " Jesus God , " he said and got the bottle of whisky . This time he did not offer her any . " I ai n't going back , " she said . " Maybe at night . . . " He took another swallow and then shook his head . " Me , I could n't find my way through back in there in the dark too , " he said . " You could ? " " I could , for sure . But only one way I know in the dark . " " So ? " " It go all the way around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are right now , before it come out at the bayou. "  | " Yea , " he said . " I get it . " " Going that way , only one I know , we ai n't going to be through by light either , account of we ca n't leave here before dark . " " And they see us that way , like nothing so easy . " A couple of gulls circled overhead , curiously . " And they do n't go away , " she said nervously , looking up at the gulls , " and they going to look suspicious to somebody coining along . " " They go away all right , soon they see we ai n't something for them to eat . " After maybe ten minutes , the gulls tired of their watching and spiraled away on an updraft . " Maybe , " he said , " we just walk right into town . Got a couple shotguns . " But he knew he did n't stand a chance . One man against so many . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did . Sure he did . And they had cars too , some of them . All you would have to do would be sneak into town at night and get one of them to drive you up as far as Millaudon or maybe even a little farther to Colyell City . If they would . He shook his head . " They would n't do nothing like that . " " Account of me . " " Hell , " he said , " we do n't got to have them . " She tossed the shell away into the alligator grass . " Now look , " he said , " we can go straight on through , right straight on to Port Ronquille . " She had folded her hands on her lap and was staring down at them . " We go straight across . " Through the marsh . " And then we go right straight on through the swamp . " She jerked her head up . " If you ai n't scared . " " I never been in there , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , me . I been way up in it . One whole day long . " She was watching him with her large eyes that always seemed full of tears . " One whole day I spent going in , " he said . " Another day andp306maybe a little more and we come out back of Port Ronquille . " " We got the food , " she said slowly . " There bayous big as anything back in there , wide as nothing you seen , two , three times wide as the road at Petit Prairie . " " You find the way ? " " Sure , " he said . After a minute she stood up and retied the cotton scarf that covered her hair . " You find the way ? " " Hell , " he said , " I been telling you . " " Nothing else to do , " she said . Old Tortorich sat with a hand on each knee and stared straight ahead . Hector began to make little lines in the dusty ground with the tip of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie said . " Like that . " Tortorich said , " Nick gets some of his brothers and they go to Petit Prairie . And they ask around and they find out Niccolene ai n't been there . And they sit down waiting . " Eddie nodded . Belle had begun to sweep the side yard clear of twigs and grass , the way she did every day . She had a special broom of rushes tied to a long handle . The ground was dusty and cracked and hard as a floor . " And we see you take the priest . And we see the candles you burn in Catfish Bay . " Tortorich smiled . In his brown face his teeth were long and pointed and yellow . Rounded teeth , like an animal 's . " We did that , " Hector said . " Only us , we find something . " " What ? " Eddie asked . " Where they camp that first night  --  over by Muscat Lake . " Tortorich stopped , waited for them to understand . " Ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Tortorich nodded . " So they was heading for Port Ronquille , " Eddie said very slowly . " Son of a bitch , " Hector said . " They try , " Tortorich said , " straight through the swamp . Three , four days . With luck . " " While you looking for them in Petit Prairie . " Out of the corner of his eye Hector had seen Pete Livaudais come to thep307front door , and stand there , half hidden by the black screen . He thought he saw something else too , but he was n't sure . He did n't move his head , or give any sign , but he kept watching . " Do n't believe that , me , " Eddie said . Tortorich sighed and scratched the side of his brown crinkled cheek . " We find . " And he took out of his back pocket a folded paper box , and held it out on his palm . Eddie took it . The paper box from a tube of Squibb sunburn cream , on it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crushed pieces of cardboard between his fingers , staring at them . " He buy that , all right , " Hector said . " Julius tell me how he could n't figure out why . " " You believe now ? " Tortorich said . The screen door slammed shut and Pete came running down into the yard , shotgun in his hand . Eddie did not move , but Hector stepped out to meet the boy . It was over in a few seconds , so fast that the gun did not even go off . The boy 's body , tense and muscular as it was , went down under Hector 's weight . Tortorich looked over and grinned . Eddie did not turn his head . Hector held the boy down with his knees , and punched him a couple of times , not too hard , but enough to make him grunt . Then Hector got up , nudged the boy with his toe . " Get away from here . " Pete disappeared at once . Belle was standing at the corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided looking at her . " They ai n't there now , " Eddie said in a half question . " We ask and we look , " Tortorich said , " and they ai n't there now . " " They coulda left . They coulda take a bus or hitchhike . " " They ai n't left , " Tortorich said . He stretched his baseball cap on his knee , carefully workingaround the band . " The road , " he said , " five mile out the town , the rain that come wash out the little bridge . So they got to ferry the cars across . " He put the cap back on his head . " And the man there , he marry my wife 's cousin 's girl . So he tell us . And he say there ai n't nobody come along . "  |p308Eddie  said nothing . " They do n't even get there , " Tortorich said . " We know . " They went back to the dock , the three of them . The old man first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his half-bald head with it . Four or five feet behind was Eddie . He had rolled his undershirt up under his arms now and he was scratching at the prickly heat that peppered his body . Half-a-dozen yards away , Hector followed , still holding the shotgun . Tortorich freed his line and dropped it into the bow of his skiff . The water was still , and the hull sat on it almost without moving , while he fiddled with the outboard . Eddie came and sat on the edge of the dock , looking down . Hector stood with his head tilted back , looking at the gulls and the single brown pelican that circled in the white sky . " They was intending to go right straight through the swamp , " Tortorich said . " Maybe you could make the way through ? " Eddie shook his head slowly . Tortorich slapped the motor with the flat of his hand , and then began to wrap the cord tightly around the starter . The skiff moved slightly under the dock ; he gave it a shove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Nobody find the way through . " " I do n't get this , " Hector said . " Why you come all the way over here to tell us when you know all about it ? " " You go back to looking one day , " Tortorich said . " Maybe you find . " " I do n't reckon we be looking , " Hector said . Tortorich went on . " You find something of her , you give it to us . " He yanked at the starter rope . The motor sputtered and died . " If we find , we give him back . " Eddie just nodded . After a few more tries , he got the motor started . He adjusted the throttle and then swung out . The pelicans splashed up , beating the air with their clumsy wings . They stood watching until he disappeared around the point . The pelicans came back and settled on the water , swimming their tight circles . " Waiting for their fish guts , " Hector said softly . Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun-polished water to the line of saw grass . " Two out there . " His head wasp309hurting ; he rubbed it slowly . " I plain crazy to come out in this sun with no cap . " Out in the bay four or five mullet broke water in a series of frantic leaps and disappeared . " They really chased , them , " Eddie said . He felt himself begin to shiver , even in the hot sun , and he rubbed his hands up and down his arms . Hector put the shotgun down on the wharf and lit a cigarette . " A crazy kid , " Eddie said , " from the time he could walk . " " Some born like that . " " He did n't say how old she was . " " No , " Hector said . " Maybe she was pretty . " Sometimes those girls were , with their black hair and their big black eyes . But it would n't matter any more with the fishes and the insects working at her . Hector was cracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a piling which was covered by a hammered sheet of galvanized tin . He felt peculiar , sick at his stomach sort of . He stared down at the water . It was thick and heavy , almost oily . It was that way in the bayous sometimes . " He did n't have to go running off like a tramp , " he said . Hector nodded . " He could brought her back , " Eddie said , " and gone up with one of the boats , the regular way . " " We coulda got him on that bus for New Orleans all right , " Hector said . " Ai n't no family going to stop us . " " A crazy kid . Born crazy . " " Yea , " Hector said . Eddie sighed and rubbed the palms of his hands down the length of his thighs . " No , " he said , " I do n't believe he could come back , him . We would n't done that . " " Maybe . " " Musta thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Eddie looked up and over at the distant marshes again , and he squinted and rubbed his face in his hands . " She must been pretty , " he said . Hector nodded . " He always had eye for pretty girls . "  | " Yea , " Hector said . " He did n't got to go sneaking out across the swamp . .. . August Claverie going up the next morning . He 'd took them . " Hector did n't answer . " He 'd took them , " Eddie said . " And we 'd gone along to make sure nothing happen . " Still closer the pelicans were riding on the water , brown ones and gray . " They still waiting , " Hector said , pointing to them . " I do n't reckon they could come back , " Eddie said , " after all . " Hector kept his eyes on the pelicans . " We would n't done it . " Hector just nodded . " There was n't no way to go but through the swamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which way he was going , " Hector said . " I never seen her , " Eddie said . " Yea , " Hector said . " Cottonmouths out there . . . they the only thing do n't bother running when a man comes along . " " I know , me . " " You figure it was a cottonmouth ? " " I do n't know . How 'd I know ? " " You can see the trees from here , just barely . " " I never noticed that before , " Hector said . " Those 'd be the ones just east of Rabbit Bayou , no ? " Hector nodded . " Around where we got the crawfish last March . The black ones , that was all heads and no tails . " " That was n't fit for nothing more than bait , " Eddie said . Hector said : " I wonder , was she pretty , her ? " " She ai n't now , " Eddie said , " not after she been feeding the gars and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he shivered , shivered hard , his whole body shook . Hector did n't look , trying not to see . When the spasm had passed , Eddie said : " You figure they bring him back here , if they do find him ? " " Yea . " " You believe the old guy ? " " Yea , " Hector said.  |p311Eddie  looked down at his hands . The skin on their backs was still prickled . " Shivering in the sun , " he said , " maybe I got the malaria again . " " Maybe , " Hector said . " You got things to do , " Eddie said . " Why you do n't go do them ? " " Me ? " Hector said . " No . And I 'd just as leave stay here . " Eddie reached in his pocket and found a pack of cigarettes . They were bent and crumpled . He put the pack on the top of the piling and took a single cigarette . He smoothed and straightened it between his fingers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw it away . They spent all afternoon there , smoking . Every time they dropped a cigarette down into the water , there was a flash of small transparent fish up to the surface to nibble on it.  |p312IT  hit young Pete Livaudais hard . He was n't home for a couple of days . He stayed down in the west end of the island . Annie saw him once , but it was only at a distance and only for a second before he ducked behind some palmettos . " Leave him , " Eddie said . " He do n't want to see nobody . " The people who lived in the most western of the houses  --  the Cheramies  --  they thought they could hear sobbing and crying . But it was so far away they could n't be sure . Cecile said : " If he do n't come out soon , somebody got to go get him . " And Hector shook his head . " He got a right to it . " Cecile looked at him , squinting . " You know something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . " " How strange ? " " If I could tell , " she said , " maybe I would n't be worrying . " " Nothing wrong with me . " " I guess so , maybe . " " Tell you what , " he said suddenly and began to grin , wide and bright , " let 's us go in to Petit Prairie . " " Now ? In the middle of the weektime ? " " Sure , " he said . " I 'm gon na borrow the Tangerine from Perique . And him and your old man , they can work if they want to without me . Or they can get somebody else . " " Right now ? " " Sure , " he said , " we ai n't that hard up for money . " " What we do ? " " What we do ? " he mimicked . " See what going on . Go to a movie . " He was on his feet . He flipped a cap on the back of his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So we do it now .... I 'm gon na talk to Perique . " She called after him : " You got to shave . " Adele felt dreadful . She had a headache , and four aspirins had done nothing for it . Al was out working ; he had left at three o'clock that morning . There was no telling when he 'd be back  --  it always depended on how his luck was running . She walked down to the grocery and bought a small pack of tea bags . Julius Arcenaux put them in a little paper bag and rang up the cash register . " Somebody sick ? " he asked . " No , " she said . " Why ? " Julius grinned . " Nobody buys tea , unless somebody 's sick . " He had a good smile , she thought , very gay . And his reputation as a lady 's man , she thought , well , maybe . . . " I was thinking it might be nice . " " It is , for sure , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . . . but Al said he liked the young girls . .. . Claudie tugged on her skirt . " What ? " she asked . He kept tugging , giggling . Julius leaned over the counter . " Hey there , brother-in-law ! " Claudie looked up and began to grin . One thing about Julius : kids liked him , liked him at once . He reached over and swung Claudie up to the counter . " You getting heavy , brother-in-law , " he grunted . " He 's growing up , " Adele said . " God damn , " Perique said . Adele jumped . He was over in the corner , behind the counter , and he was looking through a series of small paper boxes . " Jesus God , " he said , " you old bastard , it ai n't here . " Julius did not even bother to turn around . " I bought some , not five months ago . And they got to be there . " He said to Adele : " He looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adele said . " I hope Al is having good luck . " " Thank you . " " They went down to the west , " Julius said . He had a pair of field glasses and he would often watch the boats  --  to see if theyp314put over their nets or to see what direction they were going in . " And you going to go fishing , dogaree ? " he tugged at Claudie 's hand . " Mostly he follow Annie around all day , " Adele said with a small smile . " The other kids do n't play with him . " Julius scratched his belly . " Kids go slow , " he said , " they will one day coming . " Adele tapped Claudie 's bare leg . " Let 's us go , beau . " He whimpered and would not jump down from the counter . " I get him , " Julius said . " And how you going to be a fisherman , and afraid of such a little thing ? " " He 's not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " Julius said and put him on the floor , " after Henry , nobody want their kids to go out much . " " Yes , " Adele said . " Maybe he will get a job in New Orleans . " And she went home . While she waited for the water to boil , she walked around the living-room . Too much furniture , she thought . " Claudie , " she said , " now your papa 's away , you help me , huh ? " He grinned and nodded . " And we going to move furniture , if you do what I tell you . " The water began to boil . She raced out and poured it , then brought the cup back . " How we have live with this so long , I do n't know . . . a month since I been here and it never occur to me ! " They tugged the two chairs out into the middle of the room , she pulling and Claudie pushing . " Now , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stopped to drink the tea . Claudie dropped down on the floor and panted , pretending to be a dog , lolling his head from side to side . She grinned at him at first and then the smile faded off . He paid no attention to her but went crawling around on his hands and knees , growling and panting . " You going to want to get married , " she said , not so much to him as to herself , " one of these days , if I am alive to see it , and no matter who you got , it going to be all right with me . And if they do n't like it where we living , I give you the money to go somewhere else . . . . You hear ? "  |p315He  looked over at her . And began to bark . " You not going to go sneaking around , you hear ? " He threw back his head , and howled , the long hunting howl . " Quit ! " She put the teacup on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to work . " Perique slammed out of the store . " You find the fucking bolt , " he said . " God damn if I can . " Julius shouted after him , " You said screw , man . You ai n't said bolt . ... " " You find it ! " And Perique turned and threw the piece of metal . Julius caught it and held it up between his two fingers looking at it . " That what it is , for sure , " he said . Perique was gone . He sighed and went back in the store . He put the bolt down on a shelf carefully : Perique would be back for it . Maybe , Julius thought , if he had time , he 'd look too . That might be a good thing to do . . . . Everybody was so nervous . They 'd all be having strokes if they did n't calm down . He sat down and turned on the radio . He 'd have to remember to pull closed the heavy shutters on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood like that , there were liable to be fights . And the store windows might get broke  --  just for fun . It had happened before : smashed both windows , just to get a couple of packs of cigarettes . Left the money on the counter . It was a penny short too . He 'd close those shutters . Annie came home in the late afternoon . Adele found her in the middle of the living-room . " I did n't hear you , " Adele said . " I got a start . " " I forgot , " Annie said , " you were so delicate . " If Al would just come home , Adele thought . It would n't be so bad . But if she had the girl all evening alone . . . And she was immediately furious with herself for thinking that . She put on her brightest smile . " You like the room ? " " I was just looking at it , " Annie said . Claudie had heard her too and came scooting into the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said.  | " He likes you , " Adele said and was surprised how silly that sounded . " You got paint in your hair , " Annie said . " Painting the back steps . " She reached up , trying to find the place . " Probably have to cut it out . " " I got lots of hair , " Adele said , " it do n't matter . " " When we going to eat supper ? " " I was waiting to see when your father come back . " " We all going to starve waiting for him . " Annie scratched ather forearm . " I 'm going get something out the icebox . " " There 's some cold brisket . " " I 'll find something , do n't worry . " Adele bent forward looking at her arm . " That 's poison ivy . " " No , " Annie said . " That big patch there . Put some soda on it . " " I do n't get it , " Annie repeated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " You see any sign of your father 's boat ? " " I do n't keep track of him , " Annie said ; " he 's a big boy now . " " Oh , " Adele said , " I was just wondering . " She sat down in one of the armchairs and began to unravel the sleeve of a maroon-colored sweater . Annie finished letting her eyes run around the room . She brought them back to Adele . " What you ripping up the sweater for ? " " The elbow wore through . " Adele held it up . " I 'm going to knit it up again . Cuff 'll be a little narrow , that 's all . " " Lopsided . " " You wo n't notice it . " Claudie had got his ship model . He stood in the door , holdingit to his stomach , looking from one woman to the other . " Kid 's beginning to get a pot , " Annie said without looking athim . " Kids do , " Adele said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nose . " And he does smell , " she said , " phew . " Claudie giggled . " Don't. "  | " Get out here , " his mother said . " Go take the boat on the front porch . " Claudie hesitated . " Go on , stinky , " Annie told him . He grinned over his shoulder . And went . " You ought n't to talk to him like that . " " It 's true , " Annie said . Adele went back to her ripping . Her fingers went too fast . The yarn knotted . She held it up close to her eyes , trying to untangleit . " You need glasses , huh ? " Adele shook her head . " Sure you do . " " It 's just  --  hard  --  to  --  see  --  this color . " And she shook out the tangle . " Now . " Annie turned on her heel , studying the room , again . " You like it ? " Adele asked without looking up . " Nope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't like it ? " " Looks like a whorehouse , that 's why . " It was so quiet you could hear the butterfly bushes on the side of the house brush against the boards . " Oh . . . " Adele said softly . " You ask me , " Annie said . " I never been in one , " Adele said , still softly , " so I do n't know . . . . But I guess maybe you have . " You could hear Claudie singing to himself on the porch . It was a minute before Annie understood . When she did , she flashed out of the room , kicking over the closest table as she went . When Al came home , Adele had not quite had time to get the puffiness and the red away from her eyes . And the powder which she put on quick when she heard him coming , did no good at all . " Now look , " Al said , " you going to stay still and listen to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Annie said . " Okay . Quit yelling . " He found her coming along one of the paths not far from the house.  | " You ai n't too big for whipping now , " he said . " And I got to , I do it right out here . " " Oh hell , " Annie said . She managed to swagger her shoulders . " You give me just one good reason you got for walking in the house and calling Adele a whore . " " Oh Jesus , " Annie said , " I did n't call her that . " " Do n't go lying . " " I did n't . " " You say it look like a whorehouse in the parlor . " She tilted her head and squinted at the top of the young palm trees . " Answer me . " " She asked me if I like it . " " What you tell her ? " " Told her the truth . " " What ? " " Looked like a whorehouse . " Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigarette . " Now I got something to tell you . " " What ? " She screwed up her mouth and tried to look uninterested . " You going back to the house and make you ' apologies . And you are going to start being polite . " She shrugged and looked away . " And you are going right now . " " Ca n't make me . " He looked at her . " I 'm going to make the biggest yell you ever did hear . " ' " And who going to interfere . . . Inky ? " She jumped a little . She had been thinking that , though she had not realized it . " That what you thinking ? " " Not thinking nothing , " she said . " He ai n't going to do nothing . " " I do n't need him , " Annie said . " I can take care myself . " " You going back if I got to carry you . " " Okay , " she said , " okay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm gone . "  | " Where ? " " None of your business . " " With him , no ? " He jerked his thumb over his shoulder toward the north side of the island and the wharf . " None of your business . " " Well , maybe , " he said . " Maybe you get to starve in New Orleans . But if I was betting , I give odds you ai n't going to get there . " " Shows how much you know . " She tried to pull free and did not succeed . " If my mother was around , you would n't go acting this way . . . . Leggo ! " He did n't pay the slightest attention . He was dragging her steadily along the path to home . " Leggo ! " she yelled . And Claudie came scuttling out of the bushes to stand wideeyed . " You going to be surprised , " Annie said . " I would n't stay around here for nothing . " It was easier to walk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't keep me here . " " Maybe , " her father said quietly . " Maybe not . " " I 'm telling you ! " Therese Landry stood leaning on the door of the kitchen talking to her mother . " Jeez , " she said . " They sure fighting . . . . Her mother looked up from the peas she was shelling , the last of the season 's peas . " What ? " " I was coming home and what do I see ? " " What ? " her mother asked patiently . " Old Al just dragging Annie along like she was a sack of feed . " " That been coming for a long time , " her mother said . Therese scratched her ear . " It sure here now . " Her mother popped a couple more peas into the dish . " You hear what they was fighting about ? " " Adele . " A few more pods emptied their scant loads . " Poor peas , for sure . But I can make a soup outa these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house . So I could really tell what was up . " She hesitated . " You do n't have to look at me like that  --  you 'd done the same thing . " Her mother shrugged . " So ? " " Claudie was sitting on the front steps , big as life . And there was n't no way to get closer without him seeing me . " Her mother shook her head , a large head with a heavy mat of gray-streaked hair . " Second wife she said . " It do n't ever work smooth . " Therese took a handful of the pods and began to shell them . " Do you reckon , " she said after a while , " she is going to go off with him ? " " Who ? " " You know who I 'm talking about . " " Annie ? " " And Inky what's-his-name . " Her mother lifted her shoulders , high up , so that they almost reached her ears , and let them drop again . " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Just wondered . That 's all . " " It come out , " her mother said . " In time . It all work out . The way it is going to work . Sooner or later . " " Still wish I 'd heard , " Therese said.  |p321FIFTEEN  minutes later Annie came hurrying out the front door . She gave the screen a hard swing behind her so that it almost jumped off its hinges . Her father yelled . She started to take the steps in one leap . Just at the top her ankle turned , and she fell down them , ducking her head under , bouncing once on her shoulder , landing on her hip and arm . She was up in a minute , half running , half hobbling , but moving . Claudie , who had had himself pulled up into a tiny corner of the steps when she came by , got down and trotted after her . She went to the tiny field of clover grass that was completely surrounded by thick oleander bushes . She pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she got inside , she sat down , on her good hip . And she looked at her arm . There was a long brushburn from her elbow down to her hand : it was bleeding , slightly . She sat staring at it , until Claudie wiggled through the tangle and sat down beside her . " God , " she said , " get out of here . " He did n't move . " Beat it , " she said and lifted her good arm . He moved out of reach , sliding along the grass on his rear . And waited . " Now I know what happen , " she said , spitting the words out as if each one tasted bitter . " You sitting up there at the top of the steps so innocent and quiet . . . and you trip me . Yessir , I 'm getting to see it now . " " No , " Claudie said . " Jesus ! " she lifted her eyebrows . " You can talk . . . . Maybe you human after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and staying well out of reach.  | " Trip me , " Annie muttered . She felt her hip carefully and then began rubbing it softly . It hurt  --  so much that her eyes began to water . " Do n't cry , " Claudie said . " God damn it . . . go away ! " He pushed himself back a couple of feet . She stretched out on her back and doubled up her legs . And the little wires of pain ran all through her body . Maybe I 'm going to die , right here , and the crows 'll come and eat me . . . . " You would n't have the sense to go call anybody . " They 'd never find me . It would be like Henry . Only right on the island . Even she did not quite believe that , so she gave up the thought . She rubbed her shoulder , in small circles . That made it feel better . She closed her eyes and felt the warmth of the sun on her face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face passed in front of her closed eyes : the plain face , with its smooth olive skin and its smooth brushed hair . Annie put up a hand and rumpled her own hair fiercely . Bitch , she thought , bitch . If my real mother was alive . . . . She tried to remember her mother , but she could n't seem to remember very much . She could n't seem to find the details she wanted , the details that made the image real . . . . It was the sun . For sure . Somebody was whistling . They would be passing , and not too far away . She recognized the tune : " Tennis Shoes . " The sound faded and stopped . She wondered idly who it was . Her leg was burning , and she thought she could feel a little dripping . She had scraped that too  --  she was furious . Always did have weak ankles , she told herself , and you could n't expect anything else from them . She opened her eyes once : a brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . She let her eyes slide closed again . Claudie giggled . " What ? " " Gone . " She opened her left eye . The rabbit was gone . " Nothing I can do about it . " Her fingers patted the grass that the rabbit had been nervouslyp323chewing . It would be nice to live out here . . . in a tent or something like that , so you could be near to the ground . You could find some bricks and make a little fire and cook over them . Except when it began raining , in February . " I wo n't go back there . " She could hear Claudie stir himself to listen . She peeped at him . He was bent forward so that his chin was almost on the grass , he was listening so hard . " Lots other places . " Claudie nodded , eagerly . She opened both eyes . " You do n't look much like her , " she said . " Maybe you 're not her son . Not really . " Claudie shuffled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind , moving around like that . " A crow circled way up in the white-blue sky . His gigantic shadow flicked over them . " Maybe she just found you someplace . " If you had a floor to your tent it would n't be bad out here , even in February . But somebody owned it . Had to . Somebody owned all the land , even if it was only marsh and no solid spot on it , and even if it was only the state government . . . . If you just had your floor a little off the ground so the water would run under it . . . . " I 'd live all alone . I would n't have a soul with me . " You would n't have to work , you would n't have to have money to buy things . You could live on the things you could find . She rolled over on her side and squinted up at the sky through the blades of grass and weed . She stopped pretending . She was n't hurt . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm was gone and the anger that had been like a fist doubled inside her . I 'll go back , she thought . Maybe . No place else to go . Yet . She thought about Inky and she did n't feel anything either . When she tried to imagine him , it was Perique 's face that formed instead . There were so many things going on inside her . She could feel them  --  tumbling around like clothes in a washing-machine , she thought.  |p324ANNIE  had her usual early supper that evening , only this time she hurried even more . She finished just as Adele and Al came back , and she ducked into her room without their seeing her . Then she climbed out the window . Claudie did n't follow her . Adele had found him and was making him brush his teeth  --  which he never did and which were getting coated with a yellow-white film . As Annie swung herself over the side fence she could hear the yelling begin inside . And she went hunting for Inky . Without asking anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along them . There was not a single person there . She went and looked in the packingplant , but it was just an empty room , with long tables and a black wet floor . A couple of cats wandered around , looking for bits of shrimp . As she walked away , she noticed a half-shrimp still in the drain chute . It was covered black with flies . She picked it up  --  it was warm from the sun  --  and walked back to the door and threw it to the cats . He was not on the Pixie . But then he would n't be  --  he would n't expect her this early . Next she walked along the back path to see if he was n't fishing from one of the little piers . She saw young Allen Cheramie , dozingthere , with a pole in his hand , and two other poles wedged down and weighted with bricks . He had been asleep so long that a pair of sea gulls were roosting on a piling not ten feet away from him . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its color , something that told you it was September , though it was just as hot as midsummer . She 'd often tried to figure that out : it was n't a change of color exactly , though that was close to it . She walked quickly back over to the grocery , the sweat runningp325down her face . Ted Mitchaux was on the porch there , reading an old copy of Life . He looked at her over his cracked glasses . " Looking for somebody ? " " No , " she said , and wiped the sweat off her face . " You sure want him quick , running on a day like this . " " No , " she said , " I just got energy , me . " " Running like Jean Sot with the wind . . . . You ever hear that story ? " He took off his glasses and held them carefully between the fingers of his right hand . His little shriveled face stared at her . He looked like a prune , she thought , wrinkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His papa must have been a Negro , for sure . " You told me all your stories . " " Now I know I ai n't done nothing like that . " But she had gone . Annie saw Mamere Terrebonne working in her garden , bent over , like a half-opened knife . Annie went over . Now she could see that it was not gardening at all . The old woman was carefully replanting the yellow lightbulbsthat lined the garden beds . " How you ? " Annie said . The old woman did not straighten up ; dipping her head lower , she looked at Annie from under her arm . Like a chicken , like an old chicken whose feathers are torn and mostly gone , her petticoat , dress and sweater , apron and shawl flapped and hung around her . " How you doing ? " Annie said . " You looking for the man , eh ? " Annie shrugged . " No . " Mamere laughed and coughed at the same time . She began to straighten up . Annie went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . " I know you want him , me . " She shuffled her feet in their heavy men 's army boots , and she stepped on the drooping hem of her flannel petticoat that had once had a design but was now faded into a kind of yellow-gray color . " How you know ? " Annie asked  |p326Mamere  patted the wide-brimmed gray hat that she had pinned on by her old long hatpin with its tarnished little silver knob . " One man gone , you go looking for the other . " " Lord , " Annie said , " how you talk . " " Shu . . . I talk true , maybe ? No ? " " Lord , Lord . . . " Annie said , " I got no man . " Mamere planted her thin hands with their heavy cords of veins on her hips . It was hard to tell if she were a man or a woman . The body had no shape , though it did wear skirts . The shriveled , wrinkled face with its little straggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get that old , Annie thought ; hope to God I never get that old . Mamere said : " You got a man che ' . Me , I know it . And everybodyknow it . " Annie swung her foot back and forth , knocking off the tops of the long raggedy grasses . " Me , I do n't know or not he was your first . . . . " They know everything so fast , Annie thought . And how do they find out . . . . There 's nothing they do n't know . She pushed the hair back from her forehead , noticing too that it had a little sour odor . Been so long since I washed it , she thought . And . . . I bet they know everything : how many times I been down to the boat . I bet they can count the just right number . And how many times we did it . Nothing to do but watch and figure out things , she thought . I bet they counted . Mamere giggled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " Annie walked away then . Mamere turned slowly , the iron heels of her boots digging in the soft mud , and watched her go . Annie slipped into the long thick line of bushes that grew in the shell ridge just to the back . She was still wearing shorts and the blackberry vines scratched her thighs . Damn , she thought , I ought a go back . But she just pushed her way through more carefullyand a little more slowly . After a couple of dozen feet there was an oak . She climbed to one of the broken branches and looked around . She did n't see Inky . She did n't see much of anything . Just ap327couple of kids playing dollhouse under a tent of palm leaves . She watched a few minutes before she picked her way out . She went on looking , up and down the tangle of the connecting shell paths , slower now and not hurrying , never hurrying , but moving just the same . The island seemed quiet and empty . Most of the boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one back early ) , and most of the men with them . And the women , they were n't walking around . They 'd be gathered in little groups of three or four in kitchens somewhere . Annie could have found them fast enough . If she 'd wanted to . She kept strolling on , hands in the back pockets of her shorts . The only one , except for the kids and the animals , moving . She had covered most of the paths on the eastern end . Finally she headed out along the single straight path that went out to Point Caminada to the west . Minute she came out of the trees she saw him , sitting on top of the tumble of concrete blocks where the light had been once . " Hey ! " she called . She was afraid to come on him by surprise . Afraid of what his face might look like , if he turned it on her suddenly . Stupid .. . He looked over his shoulder . And lifted his left hand slightly . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The big old straw hat tugged at its strings under her chin as she scrambled up the blocks and squatted down by him . " Crabbing ? " " Hell , no . " " You should n't be out without a hat . " " Yea , I know , " he said . She felt the top of his head . " You get sunstroke . " " What are you doing down here ? " " Looking about the crabs , " she lied . " I did n't want to lug all the nets and bait down here for nothing . " " I been seeing some , " he said . " I see one right now . " " Where ? " She pointed . Down almost directly below them , in the rocks and seaweed , a single big blue claw . " Man I knew in New Orleans could catch ' em with his bare hands . "  | " I would n't try it , me . " " He could all right . " She half-closed her eyes against the glare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Going crazy . " " Huh ? " " Look , " he said , " I got a sailboat that do n't belong to me . And I been on it how long ? And it 's hot as hell there and there ai n't room enough . . . . " " It 's a beautiful boat . " " Sure , " he said , " only a sailboat 's no good unless it 's moving and there a breeze going through it . " A real unusual hot summer  --  they call ' em weather breeders . " " Yea ? " " Say it 's a sign of hurricanes coming . " " Hell , " he said , " a hurricane would be cool . " " Do n't go joking . " " I mean it , " he said . " Where 's your shadow ? " " Who ? " " Claudie . " " I got away from him . " A young gull  --  soft brown color  --  settled on the water and waited , watching them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " he a friend of yours ? " " Who ? " " The kid who did n't come back  --  " " Henry ? " " Yea . " " Sure I knew him , " she said . " You know everybody on this island or you 're blind , deaf and dumb . " " I guess so . " " Why ? " " Just wondering . " " Wondering what ? " " Nothing special . " A clump of seaweed with bright orange berries washed up and hung on a cement projection , gleaming under the sun.  | " You know , " Inky said , " place where I was last summer , had six- and eight-foot tides ? " " No tide here , " Annie said . " Few inches , " Inky said . " That 's what I meant . " " You did n't say that . " My head hurts , Annie thought . And my back too . Maybe I 'm going to have a period . " The gal was from over there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got no reason to feel bad , Annie thought , except maybe the heat . I ought to feel fine . " Over there ? " Inky repeated . " Huh ? " He pointed to the low rise of trees across the pass . " Oh , " she said , " yea . " Inky wiped the sweat off his forehead with the back of his hand . And then he closed his eyes against the glare . She yawned , and hunching over settled her forehead in her hands . She tipped back the hat so that the sun did not burn her neck . " Look , " he said without opening his eyes , " have n't you got anything else to do ? " " No , " she said . " Do n't you have to wash the dishes or mop or something ? " " Where ? " " At your house . " " Hell , " she said , " Adele does all that . . . . Anyway , it 's her house . " " Oh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell , no , " he said . " I was wondering if you was n't bored . " " Nuh-uh . " A kingfisher shot right over their heads , screaming . Annie said : " When are you going into New Orleans ? " " With the Pixie ? " " Uh-huh . " " Jesus , " he said , " I do n't know . "  | " You do n't like it here ? " " Not the most exciting place I 've ever been . " " I know , " Annie said . " I bet you do n't get bored . " " But I do . . . awful sometimes . " She opened her eyes ; he was shaking his head . " I do , " she said . " Can I come in to New Orleans with you ? " " What ? " " I can get a job , " she said . " I saw the want ads just last week . " He scratched his head : the sweat tickled . " At the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that . " " I just do n't want to go in all by myself , " she admitted slowly . " And looks like we going about the same time . " " Hell , " he said , " I did n't know you wanted to leave here . " " Only I do n't want to go in by myself . . . kind of scary , " she said and felt ashamed . " You do n't think I can get a job ? " " Hell , " he said , " there 's lots of jobs in New Orleans . " " You going to take me in ? " " Sure , " he said . She felt herself relax . She stretched , slowly , carefully , all over , like a cat.  |p331AND  that next day Pete Livaudais came back from the western end of the island where he had been hiding . Story LeBlanc saw him first , walking along the main shell road , which was just a little wider than the other paths . He looked sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his face  --  but he did n't look bad , except for his clothes being muddy . When he saw him , Story wondered what he should say or if he should take himself back into the brush and disappear . But when they passed , Pete Livaudais just lifted his hand in the halfgesturehe had had since he was a child , and said : " Hi . " And Story LeBlanc spent the rest of the afternoon telling peoplewhat he had seen and how it looked like the kid was over the worst of it . " Without losing his wits , " Mamere Terrebonne said when she heard , " yes ? " " Look all right to me , " Story said . " Sometime . . . " and Mamere touched one yellow wrinkled finger to her forehead . When Eddie Livaudais came down to the Rendezvous for a drink later on , he did n't have to be asked questions . He knew what everybody was wondering and so he told them . " Had to get over the worst , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . Had to go out there where there was n't nothing but dogs and animals to watch him . " Coming over to hear the news , Annie met Perique just outside the Rendezvous . She had n't talked to him for a couple of weeks . " Where you been keeping yourself ? " She was glad to see him now . " Working , " he said . " You going to ask me in for a beer ? " " If you boyfriend do n't object . " There was a little twinge , a little hurt . But she laughed . " I got no boyfriend . "  | " No ? " " How 's Therese ? " " Okay . " " Have n't seen her much either , lately . " " She been around . " His face had gotten more serious in the last couple of weeks , she thought . But maybe it was just the dark . " You look different , " she said . " Me ? No . " They went inside . Over in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little group . Perique went down to the other . " You do n't want to hear ? " He shook his head . " Why not ? " " Do n't like listening to other people 's miseries , me . " " I never thought of it that way . . . but I guess it is so . " Perique went around behind the counter and got the two beershimself . " Too busy down there to give us any attention . " " They 're interested , all right . " " Forgot the glasses . " And he went around the counter again and fished the glasses out from the ice locker . He shook them out , then put them up on the counter . " It 's interesting , " she said , " for sure . " " You go listen . " She shook her head . " That what you come over here for . " " In a way , but I can hear it later . " She poured the beer carefully so that there was no foam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He nodded . " You do n't look happy about it , " she said . " There 's all sorts of ways of coming back . " " I do n't get it . " He leaned sideways against the bar . " You seen Pete yet ? " She shook her head . " Well , I see him . " She brushed the hair back out of her eyes . " So ? " " He do n't look good to me . " " What 's wrong with him ? "  | " You ask me , " Perique said , " and I tell you what I think . Only I ca n't tell you why I think it . " " What 's he look like ? " Perique shrugged . " Everybody say he look tired to death . " " He was plain crazy about that brother of his , " Perique said . " Maybe nobody ever figured out how much until just now . " " He took it hard . " " Still taking it hard , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " " Maybe , " Perique said . Annie turned and squinted into the cracked mirror behind the bar , a mirror trimmed with red and green feathers and some that were just plain gray-brown ( that had come straight from ducks ) . Annie looked at herself and at Perique . " You never come by the house , " she said . " I thought you was busy . " " Not all the time . " Down at the other end of the bar , Eddie Livaudais straightened up and pushed his way through the people around him . " I got to get home , " he said over his shoulder . He crossed the room in that loping bowlegged gait of his . " Hi , love birds , " he said to Annie and Perique . And then again over his shoulder to the group that had re-formed in a straight line along the bar , he said : " I got to see how he make out . . . tired as a puppy dog he come in . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said quietly , " how getting one back after two days makes him forget how he lost the other one for good . " Annie went back to staring at the feathers that fringed the mirror . You could see the lacy work of cobwebs linking them all together . " I wish I knew what I thought , " she said . " You having trouble ? " There was a little mocking twist in his voice and she was very sorry the words had slipped out . " I have n't been feeling too good , lately . " " Sick ? " " My head hurts all the time . " " It 's all the thoughts , " he said , " swirling around inside . "  | " Quit making fun of me . " Like colors , all mixed . And how would you straighten them out ? And how would you make sense out of them ? Or did you just wait ? Perique did not come by the house to see her . For a couple of days she thought he would . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it . Inky kept thinking about her now . First he spread them all out carefully on the port bunk , except one which he pinned to the wall with scotch tape . Then the next day he gathered them all up , and got them set in his hands for tearing up  --  only he stopped just at the last minute . And put them under the cushions . By the next day they were back out again . Still , when he spotted her coming , he ducked below and gatheredthem up and put them in the big locker . When she got there he was back on deck , polishing the brass lamps . They were lined up on the dock with the little heap of rags and the bottle of polish . " Hi , " she said . The dock was empty . Mid-afternoon  --  most people would be home taking a nap after dinner if they were n't actually out on the boats . Even the September sun was too strong around noon . She could feel it now , burning through the straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Can I come aboard ? " she said . He waved his arm . She came . The varnished wood burned the soles of her feet . And when she sat down beside him  --  he had not put out the cushions  --  the wood stung the backs of her thighs with its heat . She lifted up her legs , hugging them with her hands . " It 's too hot to sit . " " Want me to get you a cushion from below ? " " No , " she brought her legs down , sitting half on her hands . " It get cool in a minute . " " You think you ought to be coming out here in broad day-light ? " " Why not ? " " People 'll figure out something 's been going on . "  |p336She  watched his face with the prickles of light brown beard . He had n't shaved that morning . And he was frowning as he looked at her . " I reckon , " she said , " most everybody know I been sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped and relit it . " They ai n't going to mind that , " Annie said . " Look , " he said , " if your old man 's coming after me with a shotgun , I want to know it . " She smiled , very slowly . " He ai n't going to care about it . " " Yea , " he said doubtfully . A big brown pelican skimmed over the top of the mast and settled on the water . " Want me to help you ? " She jumped up suddenly and scrambledout of the cockpit to the dock . Let 's us clean up the lamps . " " I 'll be damned , " he said softly as he picked up the polishing rag . She crouched back on her haunches , holding the lamp against her thigh . By the time they had finished there was a big black smear reaching almost all around her leg . She giggled . " Look what I done . " " Got some on the front of your shirt too . And on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of her hand . " Off ? " " Hell , no . " A single fat torn cat swaggered past them andsniffed the polished lamps . " Come on down below and I 'll get awashrag . " They tried to carry all six lamps at once . The sponge fell overboard . They stood and watched it float on the surface of the water and giggled . " It ai n't no good , " Annie said . " Let the gars have it . . . . This deck is burning my feet off . " She ran down the ladder hastily . " Owwwww . " " Take the damn lanterns . " He handed them down to her , two at a time . Then he swung down himself , not touching the ladder , but lowering himself by the arms . His leg brushed by her shoulder . She stepped aside . They hung the lamps in their gimbals . " Now , " Annie said , " that looks nice and neat , no ? " " Shipshape , all right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do on a boat like this all day . " " Me ? " He scratched his head . Little trickles of sweat were runningalong his scalp . The cabin was hot and close . " Let me see . I fixed up that air scoop , over the forward hatch , so I could breathe down here better . Then I cleaned up the lamps . " " Those old lamps was just sitting on the dock when I come along . I cleaned them as much as you . " " You win . " He started to pass her ; in the narrow way between the bunks , he brushed hard against her , his shoulder against her breast . For one minute she wondered if he felt that as much as she . He was stooping down opening the little refrigerator door . " Can I get you a beer ? " " I do n't want anything , me . " His face was so close that she could see the little flecks of black in his blue eyes . " Have some brandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She pulled away and sat down on the bunk , tucking her feet under her , keeping her thighs pressed tight together . " Ever taste brandy ? " She shook her head . " Here . " He poured an inch or so in the bottom of a tumbler and handed it to her . " Taste it . " She took a mouthful , swallowed and sputtered . Two tears came to the corners of her eyes . She brushed them away and rubbed at her throat . He was laughing . " I did n't tell you to go take a big mouthful . " With one hand still rubbing her aching throat , she threw the rest at him . He caught the glass neatly . But the brown liquid formed a trail across the polished floor , up the **26;11486;TOOLONG of the bunks . Some even splattered the portholes and ran down the white-painted wood . " Jesus Christ , " he said . " The varnish ! " " Clean that up , Mister Funny Rabbit . I got other things to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed her around the waist . " Honey , if I was n't crazy about you , you 'd end overboard , for sure . " He backed up , holding her , and sat down , still holding her so that she sat in his lap.  |p338She  laughed , a short quick little giggle . " You never got that drink . " " Nope . " He was nibbling at the back of her neck , pulling the hair between his teeth . " Lemme get it for you . " " Hell , no , " he said , " I got enough to clean up now . " " Crazy old man , I ai n't going to spill nothing . " She pulled free , and getting the brandy poured it out in the same glass . " Like this ? " " Plenty . " " And I got to fix one for myself , " she said . She mixed a little Bourbon with a glass of water and bounced down on the opposite bunk . " That all ? " he frowned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She giggled again , the same way . All her laughs sounded exactlyalike . " Come here . " He patted the bunk alongside him . She shook her head . " Okay , " he said . " I was planning to do just exactly that . " He swallowed the brandy . " Be a good girl and reach me that bottle . " She brought it . He yanked her down beside him . " You 're the damndest girl . A guy 's got to play tricks to get ahold of you . " She settled back against the pillows , smiling . " I did n't want you getting any ideas . " " I got them already . " Outside a gull gave its wailing openthroatedcall . " I just got to look at you wiggling that behind when you walk , and I get ideas . " She giggled again and leaned farther back . Since he kept his arm around her waist , she leaned in a semicircle over it . " That all you got to say , just giggle ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . " He closed one eye . " Honey , you do n't mean that  --  right now you 're leaning back like that so I can see your tits through your shirt . " She sat up abruptly . " I like you anyway , " he said . With one hand he held her head steady , as he kissed her . " Tastes like sugar to me. "  |p339She  tried to pull and squirm away . Her body only rubbed more closely against his . " Honey , " he said , " the tips of your nipples are real sharp . " " Lemme go . " She slapped him . He only grinned . " Nothing I like more than a woman fighting mad . " She slapped him again . " Now quit , " he said . " You 're beginning to hurt . " She drew back her hand again . He caught it . " When you start scratching like a cat , that 's no fun . " " Enfant garce , " she said and blew in his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what that means . But I can figure it 's no compli-ment . " She got one hand free and jabbed for his eyes . " Jesus Christ , " he grabbed her , " I 'm likely to end up tying you down . " She was quiet . A little shudder she could n't stop ran along her back . Her body quivered and twitched . He laughed , so hard that he had to lean back , and release his hold . She scrambled up . " You little bitch . . . that 's what you like . " " No , " she said , panting . She stood across the cabin , one hand holding to the railing on the other bunk . " Come here . " She shook her head . " You 're dying to come . " " No . " " Okay . " He stretched out on the bunk and , reaching one hand back into the little bookshelf , got a copy of The Saturday Evening Post . " See you . " He flipped a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read . A couple of gulls were fighting . And the water sucked very quietly at the hull . " You mad ? " she asked finally . She had n't moved . He did not look up from the magazine . " Hell , no . " " You are . " " I learned never to bother about a woman . " She came and sat beside him . " I do n't want you to be mad with me. "  | " I 'm reading . " " Stop and listen to me . " He did not move . " Stop , huh ? " She pushed down the magazine . He looked up , squinting one eye . The radio station was not quite clear and he lifted one hand over his head , adjusting it . " First you throw alcohol all over the varnish , then you try to jab my eyes out  --  why do n't you just try letting me alone ? " " I do n't want you to be mad . " " Look , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book back up over his face . " I ca n't go nowhere , with you feeling like this . " " How 'd you expect me to feel ? " " I do n't know , " she said miserably . He dropped the magazine , grinned up at her . " Baby , you sure do n't know how to take a joke . " She was still hesitating , when he pulled her down and kissed her . " I thought you was serious . " " No . " He nibbled gently on her lower lip , found her tongue and bit it softly . His hand began to move up and down her leg , brushing back and forth . She pulled herself upright . " I ca n't do nothing like that . " He smiled wearily . " Why not ? " " I could n't do anything with anybody watching . Not even a kid . " " What the hell are you talking about ? " " With Claudie sitting up there , and making faces at me , I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He twisted his head around and looked , just in time to see a faded pair of pants disappearing . " Jesus Christ ! " He jumped to his feet and was up the ladder in a minute . But even as he was climbing , he heard the quick sound of the little feet as they flashed across the carriage roof , under the boom , and then the rattle of the boards on the dock . By the time he had got topside , the boy had disappeared . Only , the shells around a half-dozen or so kegs were still rattling and rolling . He stared at the barrels for a while . Then he went slowly down the ladder again.  |p341He  sat down and put a hand on each knee . " Why the hell did you bring him ? " Annie sniffed . Her eyes were heavy with tears . " I did n't . He just come along . And there ai n't nothing I could do about it . " He sucked back his lips and whistled . They waited . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There he is again . " And the little face peered in the window . Inky got to his feet and went up into the cockpit . Not bothering to hurry this time . He stared at the kegs , at the tool shed , at the heap of old lumber . " Which one do you suppose he 's hiding behind ? " Annie had followed him up . " I do n't know . " " Oh Christ . " He threw himself down on the cockpit seat , propped up his legs and reached in his shirt pocket for his pipe . " I guess I go home . " " Might as well , " he said . " I could n't help Claudie following me . " " Sure , " he said . " I 'm going . " " See you around sometime . " When she was halfway down the dock , walking slowly , curling her bare toes at each step , the little boy slipped from behind the farthest of the kegs and followed her , his skinny legs moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her foot , and lifting up her right arm , with its fist clenched . He veered off , still at a trot , and ducked around the tool shed . She kept on , walking the full length of the dock . At the end she hesitated a minute , and glanced back over her shoulder at the boat . Inky had not moved : she could see only the back of his head . And there was a brown pelican sitting right on the top ofthe mast . 1She started home . She went along the path , feeling how hot the shells were to her feet . Then she crossed the little fields where the grass was prickly , but cool . She did not look behind her , but she could hear : the little boy had appeared again . And he was trotting along , not ten feet behind.  |p342PETE  LIVAUDAIS stayed quietly around the house for a few days , seeming to rest , though he did n't sleep much : any time of the day or night that you passed the place you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet up on the rail . It looked like he was waiting for something . But when anybody passed , he would look over and wave and give them a big smile . And unless you went over to the front steps to have a word or two , you did n't notice how deep and heavy the circles were under his eyes . That Thursday evening three of the luggers were out : the St. Christopher , the Hula Girl and the Captain Z. The Mickey Mouse , coming in , said their luck had turned bad . So they 'd be staying out until late that night . It was a thick heavy yellow twilight . Any of the women who had clothes to bleach spread them out on the grass so the very first of the morning sun could get them : best thing in the world for a stain . The mosquitoes were coming over in waves from the marshes across the bay . The cows snorted and churned their tails around , while the kids drove them back to stalls that were covered with mosquito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting down to supper with her oldest boy . The table was under the window and when she glanced out she saw Pete Livaudais . He was walking in the slow heavy way he had got , like an old man , bending forward a little from the waist as if his back was hurting . Cecile was surprised . It was the first time she had seen him come off the porch . And the sight of the bending back put a sharp little pain in her stomach  --  she could almost see the other boy , Henry , going there.  |p343So  she yelled out through the window ; " Hey , Pete ! " And he stopped short , hesitated a minute trying to figure out where the sound had come from , then turned . She could remember the flash of his teeth in the steadily darkeninglight . His face was not clear . " I got a cup of coffee here with your name on it , " she said . " Thanks , " he said . " Got to get some things down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Promised Ma I 'd get straight back . " " You got to hurry for sure , " she said , " or the mosquitoes drain you dry . " She waved and sat back down at the table . And yanked her boy 's head up out of his plate . He had fallen asleep , one cheek on the rice . Al Landry was leaving the Mickey Mouse . He was tired , and his luck had been bad , not enough to pay for the gas this time . When he heard the clatter of hollow cans he looked up . It was Pete Livaudais , dragging a cart , a boy 's wagon with bits of the flaked red paint still on it . There were two five-gallon cans jouncing on the bed . " Hi boy , " Al said . " What you doing ? " Pete waved a hand . " Got all this . " " You doing that the hard way , boy . " " Maybe . " " Why you do n't bring the engine around to the pump ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pete said . And the rusty mildew-spotted wagon jounced along the uneven boards and right along past . The kid looked tired , Al thought , real out-and-out tired . Bonetired . " Better take it easy , " he said to the blue-shirted back . And Pete said , soft and whispered , without turning : " Hell . . . . " Fornest St. Clair was reading an old copy of Good Housekeepingunder the single unshaded globe by the gas pump . " What you say , kid ? " " You want me to fill ' em ? "  |p344Fornest  got up and stretched his short stocky frame , carefully . Then he unhooked the hose . He pointed with the nozzle to themagazine he had left , face up on the chair . " Look at that . " Pete looked but did not answer . " That what I come to read . " " Yea ? " " Recipes , and babies . . . man , I 'm an expert , me . " He scratched his chin , long slow strokes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his arms hanging straight down at his sides . " My old lady , she say if I do n't get me a shave , she going to walk straight out the house . " " Yea ? " " She do it , boy . She go right straight over to her brothers ' . . . . They never did think she shoulda married with me . . . . Bastards . Like Dagos , man . " " I want the gas , " Pete said . " Sure . . . sure . " He plunked the nozzle down . " Lemme get you some lube . " " No , " Pete said . " Huh ? " " Just the gas . " " How you going to use that in an outboard ? " Pete took the nozzle and began filling the first can . Fornest grabbed it away from him . " You spill any , " Pete said , " you ai n't charging it to me . " " Never did spill a drop in my life . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the can to listen to it fill , Fornest said : " How you going to use this without no lube beats me . " " Got lube back at the house . " " Huh ? " " Got lube . " " Where from ? " " How 'd I know ? " Pete said . " It 's just there . " Fornest began the second can . " Reckon you can always come back for it , " he said . " Tell you what , man  --  bet you a dollar bill , there ai n't no lube back at your place . Ai n't like your old man to keep more stuff around than he 's going to use . "  | " Okay . " " Plain gas ai n't no use . " Fornest screwed the top on the last can and stood up . He stopped arguing , all of a sudden , when he saw Pete 's face . The boy looked like he was about to cry.  |p346WHEN  the Hula Girl came back , around one o'clock when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men did not notice anything . Maybe it all happened after that . And maybe they were n't looking . They were beat and just wanting to get to bed . Old man Boudreau and Hector and Perique did only the things they had to on the boat and then went their three separate ways . Old Boudreau limped slowly up his steps : his crippled hip hurt more than ever when he was tired . Wore out like a bull , he thought , at the spring servicing . Just inside the kitchen door , he stepped on the cat , which yeowled and scratched at him . He kicked at it , but without any real energy or direction . His wife did not even wake up . There was a light in the little back room where Hector 's son slept . Even as he came up the steps he could hear Cecile explaining : " There ai n't no painter here , che ' . . . open up you eyes and look now . " So he 'd been having another dream , Hector thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That boy now , he 'd seen his whole body shake . . . just like a branch somebody was beating . Hector dropped his pants and shirt alongside the bed . The sheet was still warm where Cecile had been lying . He stretched out waiting for her : she was still talking to the boy . " Open you eyes . Come on now . " His hands were full of grease and dirt , Hector thought . But he 'd probably marked up the sheet already . And it was such a long trip to wash them . The light went out  --  he could see that through the cracks of the boards . And he could hear Cecile close the door softly . She wasp347talking to herself . " God damn , " she was whispering , " god damn to hell ! " And would n't she be surprised , Hector thought , when she found him . Perique wiped the sweat off the back of his neck . The nights were n't even cool . But that was September . It was always like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them by the laces to his belt so that they flopped against his thigh . He stopped now and loosened them . In the room where he slept , Jesus , it would be hot . The screens kept out more air than mosquitoes . The houses had their doors and windows all wide open , and those who had them had the electric fan going all night long . If you stood still and listened you could hear the buzzing all around . And just walking past the houses , you could smell the heat and the closeness that was coming out of them . Odors hung in the air like ribbons . And you could tell what they had had for supper . The Robichaux place , he was passing that now , they 'd had meat , fried meat . Tina Robichaux always used lots of onions and garlic . And if you stopped you could hear the old man snoring away like somebody was choking him . And the Landry place , that was shrimps for sure . . . . He found himself staring at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to remember  --  he 'd been in only once since he was a man grown : that evening he 'd been drinking with Hector . . . . Was n't much over a month ago , but it seemed longer . He kept staring at the dark window , wondering . He put down his shoes , carefully , one next to the other in the very center of the path , slipped open the gate . There was a bucket by the front steps  --  the shrimps would have come in that  --  and he picked it up , carrying it in both hands so it would n't rattle . He walked around the house carefully until he came to the window , which was slightly over his head . Then he up-ended the bucket and stood on it . It sank a bit in the soft ground , but held . He put both hands on the sill and peeped in . He could n't see much through the mosquito netting , not with the moon behind him.  |p348He  reached out one finger and moved it slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one fold after the other . He had it up finally , and he held it back with his left hand . Now the moon fell straight into the room . He leaned on the sill , sniffing the warm heavy female odor which hung on the still air . He blinked his eyes quickly , getting used to the soft half-dark . The bed was under the window , but pulled out a little , to get the best of the air . Annie was there , feet toward him , sleeping on her side . She was n't at the boat . He felt relieved . He let the netting fall back across the window and , quickly as he could , he put the bucket back by the steps and slipped out the gate . His heart was pounding , the way a kid 's would , who 's just had a beating . Son of a bitching fool , he told himself silently . On his own back porch , on the railing there , was an extra piece of netting . His mother had left it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for something . . . . Whatever it was , Perique thought , it would die waiting for her . But the net would do for him now . He took it and headed for the oak grove not too far behind . The smell of houses made him sick , there in the back of his throat . He hung the net  --  carefully so it did n't tear  --  on the lowest dead twig of a little oak . Then he held out the edges with pieces of brick he found . He took off his shoes and crawled under . There were a few mosquitoes left . He set about killing them , and then he fell asleep . He was too tired to notice the sky to the west . Story LeBlanc saw it first , coming in on the St. Christopher . But by then you could n't miss it , if you had any eyes in your head . " Jeez , " he said , " they got a hell of a fire over there . " And Placide Arcenaux looked over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could see the low hump of the other island , the low bumpy outline of its scrub trees . You could see it outlined dark against the red glow . " On the north side , huh ? " Placide asked . " Somebody got careless . " " Yea , " Placide said.  |p349But  by the time they had gone in and were fastening their lines , there was another sound , a sharp flat thudding sound . Shotguns . Placide Arcenaux looked at Story LeBlanc and scratched his ear . " Look like they having a real fight over there . " And Dick Milliet shook his head . " I 'm too old to go bothering about what they doing . " He went stumping off : he had rheumatism all down one side . He carried a big bottle of aspirin ; when the pain got too bad , he would gulp three or four . Placide and Story took the skiff with the outboard and went down to the west to have a look . They lay just off Caminada Point , and they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north side , along the wharf . They could see two boats standing off , and there might have been more in the dark behind them . And they could hear the yelling . " Jeez , " Story said , " they got themselves a beaut . " There were a couple more outboards coming up from Isle aux Chiens : they were n't the only people who 'd been curious . The skiffs bobbed there , softly in the gentle swell . And the surface of the water reflected in broken planes the glow of fire . Back at the island most everybody had gone to the north side . They stood watching very quietly on the long shell mound that was the island 's backbone . The older kids were running up and down , yelling at the glow in the sky . " Burn the crap out them ! " Tim Milliet yelled and his mother gave him the side of her hand on the back of his neck . " Jeez , " he yelled , " you going to kill me . " His mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the houses under the trees , the babies were screaming . Nobodyseemed to pay much attention to them . The Captain Z put in , the last of the luggers . As he swung his bow in , Eddie Livaudais called : " They roasting over there for sure . " And he was chuckling so hard that he fumbled his stern mooringlineand dropped it in the water . So that the kids on the dock had to throw it to him again . He caught it this time , but it left a smear and a spatter of wet and seaweed on his pants.  |p350Perique  was over on the north side , looking , like everybody else . The noise had got him up . But he had n't seen anything interestingmuch . And he was turning to leave when Cecile spotted him . He grinned briefly at her round eager face . Hector had himself a girl there for sure , he thought . " Where you going ? " She was breathless and panting and grinning . Like a baseball game , Perique thought , and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " in particular . " " You want to do something for me ? " He squinted up into the sky . It was n't a very clear night after all . The stars were misty . Or maybe it was smoke . " Like what ? " he said . " Take me over there to see what going on . " Perique sighed . " And me so beat . " " You want to see , no ? " " I been working , " he said . " And I do n't give a god damn if the whole place over there burn up . " Adele was passing them . In the dim light she hesitated before her timid hello . " You want to come with us ? " Cecile asked . Adele looked from one to the other . " Tell her where we going , " Perique said . " Perique is taking us over to see what going on . " Adele was looking at him . He could feel her steady calm brown eyes . " Maybe , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He snorted . " She call you bluff , che ' . " " But then , " Adele said , " maybe you will take us ? " He thought : pretty eyes , pretty teeth , in a face that was n't much and a body that was too thin . She reminded him of his mother . Not because she looked like his mother  --  she did n't , not at all . But because she looked just the way his mother should look . " Okay . . . . " He gave up . " We going to use the Tangerine ? " " Hope , " Cecile said , " my old man 's outboard . " " Go get it , " he said . " Me , I 'm going home and get some coffee or I fall asleep . " He walked home , not hurrying . Let ' em wait , the bitches . Hep351was swearing softly under his breath all the way . A man did n't work twenty hours and then go chasing around . " Sal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the houses he passed the lights were all on ; some of the kids had got tired of watching already and had come back home . The littlest ones sat on the front steps , nodding with sleep , but not going to bed . And some of the older ones played Devil on the Banquette on the shell walks . The night was hot and still . The roosters had got mixed up : they were strutting and crowing just as if it were dawn . " Mammyjammer , " Perique muttered to himself , " getting talked into something when I 'm beat up enough . " His mother had made some fresh coffee . It was standing on the back of the stove . He took the pot and a cup over to the oilcloth-covered table and sat down : he 'd have this much in peace , for sure . He drank two cups and was pouring a third when he remembered something . All the houses had lights on , except one . Except one . . . He was sure of that . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time . One house where nobody was up : the Livaudais house . He turned it over in his mind . Eddie Livaudais , now , he 'd be still down at the boat , or talking with the people along the wharf . They had n't come back more than ten minutes ago . But there was Belle , and there was Pete . And they were , neither of them , ones to miss an excitement . Perique finished his fourth cup of coffee . Maybe he should go see . . . but it was n't any of his business . He headed back to the wharf . Even as he climbed down in the skiff and yanked at the cord of the outboard , Perique kept wondering about that dark house where the people were such hard sleepers . . . . There were five outboards bobbing in the little pass off Caminada Point . Perique headed over for them and cut the motor . They sat watching silently for a while . There was a little current here and the skiffs were drifting slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movement you hardly noticed it . And behind them , onp352Caminada Point , some kids were yelling . " They run all the way down here just to see , " Cecile said . After half an hour they turned and went in , all the skiffs together . By this time most of the people had gone back to bed . Only some of the older kids , the ones in their teens , were still wanderingaround . And they would n't be likely to go to bed at all . Perique noticed that the lights in the Livaudais house were on now , every single one was blazing out . And the surrounding houses were beginning to go dark . They just did n't seem to catch up , Perique thought . He would have to go over tomorrow and see if anything was wrong . But right now he was too tired . And so he forgot.  |p353THE  kids who were still up did not pay any attention to the outboard . They heard it , they remembered later , but they had n't been interested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle of whisky -- and they were more interested in each other . They felt excitement burn between their legs . And so most of them crossed over to the south shore to build a big bonfire on the sand . Inky heard it too . He was almost asleep under his netting-tent in the cockpit . But he listened carefully : that outboard was n't too far off . By its sound it would be running in fairly small circles : the rudder must be jammed over . " Jesus God , " he muttered , " what 's the damn fool trying to do ? " He lifted himself on one elbow and stared out . But he could n't see much through the white netting . And he did n't lift it to have a better view : the mosquitoes were bad out that night . And enough of them got through the netting without any help . He stretched out again . In a few minutes the motor sputtered and stopped . Eddie Livaudais heard nothing  --  he was on the other side of the island , over in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even before he went home he stopped and had a drink with Mike and Julius . They were playing Black Jack when Guidry Olivier stuck his head in . " Too late for you , kid , " Julius yelled at him . " Lay off , " Guidry said , scratching the mosquito bites along his arm . " But all the lights is on in Eddie 's place . " " So ? " Julius lifted one eyebrow in the way he had . " So nothing , " Guidry said . " I 'm just telling you what I seen . " " The old lady , " Eddie said , " is waiting up for me , and wondering where the hell I got to . "  | " Prenez un coup ! " And Eddie poured himself another shot . In half an hour or so , they went home , Eddie and Mike together , feeling their liquor a little , because they were so tired . " Jesus , " Mike said , " the place is lit up for sure . " Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out , me , " Eddie said , and turned in the gate . Mike plodded along , putting his feet down heavily , lifting clouds of white shell dust after each step . Belle was lying in bed . Only instead of her nightgown , she was fully dressed . Eddie stood in the doorway . " So , " he said , " you go to bed with the clothes on now . And the lights on in the house , burning up money . " She glanced down at him without moving her head and then back up at the ceiling again . " You know maybe it is not an hour until daylight ? " " Tant pire , " she said quietly . Outside a rooster began to crow . " See , " he said , " what I tell you ? " " Near morning . " " You gone ga-ga ? Burning lights all night . " He walked over to the foot of the bed and stared at her . " Who going to have need of all that light ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " where 's he at ? " " Over there , " she said . " The other island . "  |p355THEY  got up again , Mike Livaudais and Chep Songy and Jerry , got up slowly and heavily from beds that were n't even damp from their sweating bodies . They gulped left-over coffee while the kids woke up and screamed and their wives slapped them into silence . Then they followed Eddie down to the dock . Christine Bartels and Charlie D'Abadie were still on the wharf , arms wrapped around each other . They looked up when Eddie came along , slowly got to their feet , and disappeared into the trees . Charlie looked back over his shoulder once , mad at having been disturbed . Eddie had not even seen them . The red glow over at Terre Haute was gone now , and the sky was a steady , even black . The four men found some kegs and settled down to wait . It was the only thing they could do  --  no use trying to find anything in the dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely beginning to be dawn and he had to blink his eyes and shake his head to be sure . And then he yelled and pointed . The skiff was a couple of hundred yards out in the bay , motionlesson the dead still water in the flat gray mist of the first light . He yelled to the others , and he swung himself down into the skiff and picked up the oars . He had just fitted them into the locks when Eddie dropped down into the bow . Julius , who 'd been out for a walk , heard the shouts ( he 'd had a restless night and he was up far earlier than usual ) and he went hurrying over , almost running , so that his paunch jogged up and down and he had to hold it in his hands , the way a woman holds her breasts . By the time he got there Chep had already got the skiff a hundred yards out
