When the local Reds came around one day and told Vaclav Uhlik that they were going to nationalize his small machine shop in Pilsen , Vaclav made up his mind . He would escape to the West . Cautiously , he enlisted some friends in his plan : two Czech soldiers , a gardener named Josef Pisarik , Libuse Cloud , who had married an American G.I. from Sioux City back in 1949 , but had never been able to get out of Czechoslovakia to join him . Then Vaclav swapped his most precious possession , a diesel engine , for a beaten-up British halftrack abandoned after the war . <P> For two years , Vaclav and his friends begged , borrowed and stole hard-to-get pieces of iron and steel , and clandestinely carried them to the machine shop . For two years , under cover of night , Vaclav hammered and riveted his precious machine together . One midnight last week it was ready-a homemade armored car carefully designed to look like a Czech army model , even down to clattering tank tracks . The conspirators decked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of a camouflaged vehicle on maneuvers . Then Vaclav , his wife , their two young children , and the four others piled in , and the wonderful machine set off with a rumble toward the West German border 35 miles away . <P> Sleepy police patrols in Pilsen hardly glanced at it . By 5 a.m. the car had reached the barbed-wire border area . Vaclav wrenched the wheel , lurched off the road and into the wire barrier . Czech border guards stood by , mouths agape , as the machine snorted through the wire and crossed into West Germany . None fired , or even raised a Tommy gun . The car rumbled westward for several miles before West German police caught up with it . Vaclav " unbuttoned " the armor and out tumbled eight happy Czechs . " I want to get to my husband and the U.S. the fastest way , " said a very poised Mrs. Cloud . " Will you please telegraph him for me ? " <P> In Sioux City , Husband Leonard Cloud heard about it from the newspapers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we 've been hoping for for four years . "
