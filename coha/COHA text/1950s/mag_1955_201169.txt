THREE LOVES OF DOSTOEVSKY ( 300 pp. ) - Marc Slonim-Rinehart ( $4 ) . <P> <P> " Note Dostoevsky 's helplessness when confronted with love , " said Freud . " He understands either coarse animal desire or masochistic submission , or else love out of pity . " In his readable , reasonable , slice-of-love-life study of the great Russian novelist , Author Slonim , Russian-born teacher and critic , documents this Freudian analysis in detail . Avoiding sweeping generalizations , Slonim suggests that some of the grit in the oyster of Dostoevsky 's genius was put there by women . <P> Sweet Tea in Siberia . As a youngster , Fyodor was never allowed out with girls , and at his first sniff of a perfumed beauty in a St. Petersburg salon , he keeled over in a dead faint . He did better with the town doxies ( later he even hinted darkly that he once raped a little girl ) , but it was not until after he had been jailed and exiled to Siberia as a subversive that he met his first major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neurotic and married . Her drunken clod of a husband was controller of the distillation and sale of liquor in Semipalatinsk , the Siberian border town to which Dostoevsky was sent as an army private after his release from prison . Soon the smitten 33-year-old soldier and the sensitive lady were holding hands and crying into each other 's sweet tea while hubby sprawled in a drunken stupor on the divan . After Isaev died , they were married . But Maria was frigid , and Dostoevsky was soon complaining : " We 're living so-so . . . The heart will wither . I am quite alone . " <P> He was soon not so alone . A redheaded " she-nihilist " with blue spectacles , bobbed hair and romantic ideas threw herself at the feet of the literary master , and tripped him . Apollinaria Suslova was a 22-year-old intellectual spitfire of the New Woman breed . Chasing after her to Western Europe , Dostoevsky was desolated to learn that within less than a month she had taken up with and been thrown over by another man . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Apollinaria agreed , and vengefully parried all his advances . Years later , she described how the nightly sexual tragicomedy would end : " Fyodor Mikhailovich again turned everything into a joke and , as he was leaving me , said that it was humiliating for him to leave me like that ( this was at 1 in the morning ; I was lying undressed in bed ) . ' For Russians have never fallen back . ' " <P> After months of this , Dostoevsky fell all the way back to Russia , in time to see his wife waste away and die of TB . An ash-blonde , 20-year-old stenographer named Anna Snitkina , who came to take dictation for The Gambler and Crime and Punishment , stayed on to become the second Mrs. Dostoevsky , and his last and greatest love .
