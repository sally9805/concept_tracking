Once each year since 1950 , the eastern corner of the French Pyrenees has bloomed with music . The two-week-long festival in the little ( pop . 4.400 ) town of Prades is too rare and delicate a blossoming to be enjoyed through the sunglasses of ordinary tourists ; instead of 90-piece orchestras or 100-decibel choruses to remind a man that he is getting his money 's worth , the music is small and wrought with loving care for some of the most passionately musical audiences in the world . And the focus of it all is the adored and venerated master-Spanish Cellist Pablo Casals . <P> Last week Prades was in its annual bloom , and admirers followed the proud , stubby figure of the 78-year-old Catalan exile through the town and crowded his little house . Said one peeved old Pradesan : " If Casals scratches , they have to scratch the same place . " But the top-rank musicians who came to Prades were hardly less worshipful . " What does Prades mean to a musician ? " said Violinist Yehudi Menuhin to a reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch of daisies in his hand . " It means the chance to play with Casals . Why does Pianist Eugene Istomin come year after year ? No other reason except to play with Casals . This festival is just the right size-where everything is within the compass of Casals . " <P> Kiss for the Queen . This year the program was Bach , Schubert and Brahms , and everyone agreed as usual , that the master was at the peak of his power and form . In the L ' Eglise Saint-Pierre , on a platform before the altar , the old man sat playing his " tired " old cello with closed eyes . Every seat in the church was taken for the extra-long ( 2 to three hours ) concerts that are a Prades tradition , and listeners sat or stood wherever they could find breathing space . Front-row center sat Belgium 's Queen Elisabeth , noted and knowledgeable patroness of music . Applause was not permitted at the concerts-instead , whenever the audience was moved by a number , it rose in hushed silence at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Brahms string sextet played by Casals , with Violinists Menuhin and Arpad Gerescz . Violists Ernst Wallfisch and Karen Tuttle and Cellist Madeline Foley , the Queen left the audience and walked up onto the stage . Menuhin greeted her with a kiss on the cheek , then led her backstage to congratulate the shy Casals and the other members of the sextet . <P> Box-Office Tonic . Surprise hit of the festival was the nine-member Bach Aria Group from the U.S. , organized nine years ago by Oil Heir William H. Scheide , a onetime music teacher at Cornell University . Bach Specialist Scheide , who has long maintained that the cantatas are the heart of Bach 's work , figured out that about half of the cantatas ' 650-odd arias could be performed by combinations of five instruments and four voices . To prove it , he assembled the aria group , made the discovery , to everyone 's surprise that Bach vocal music was a tonic to the U.S. concert box office . <P> Best-known members of the group , as it performed at Prades , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Singing as a substitute for Eileen Farrell , Soprano Steber was much impressed by Prades ' rarefied musical atmosphere . Said buxom Singer Steber , just back from a tour in Yugoslavia : " I almost got raped there . But here - such purity ! "
