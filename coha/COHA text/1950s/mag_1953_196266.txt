The modern premedical student may get years and years of training , but does he get a well-rounded education ? This week , in the first comprehensive report of premedical education in the U.S. , three eminent deans-Aura E. Severinghaus , associate dean of Columbia University 's faculty of medicine , William E. Cadbury Jr . of Haverford and Dean Emeritus Harry Carman of Columbia College-gave their answer : " No . " As far as the liberal arts are concerned , says the report , the pre-med is shortchanged . <P> The deans spent more than two years studying 115 colleges . Wherever they went , they found " vocationally oriented " students " with little or no conception of the meaning of a liberal education . " Since only one out of three candidates gets into medical school , the student feels he must load up on science . He takes not only the required courses , but also the recommended ones , often tries to satisfy the conflicting demands of three or more schools . At some colleges , he is virtually segregated into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , is a hopelessly lopsided education . For all their progress , the colleges and the medical schools are still turning out too many physicians " with little or no interest in the cultural implications of their profession , much less in those things which would enable them to formulate for themselves a satisfying philosophy of life .
