With Government bonds near record lows , bond speculators have been taking much of the blame from the Government for their part in the debacle . Last week one of the biggest Wall Street dealers in Government bonds hit back with some plain talk about speculation and Government bond policies . The U.S. Treasury , said Aubrey G. Lanston , president of Aubrey G. Lanston Inc. , not only encouraged speculators to come into the market by tailoring its offerings to attract them , but would have been unable to sell $26.5 billion of recent middle and long-term securities without " a good dose of speculation . " <P> The theory behind the big Treasury refunding launched last January , said Lanston , " was that it should be set up to appeal to the rife speculation existing throughout the country that interest rates were bound to move lower . " To attract speculators and investors , the Treasury issued a 3% longterm bond at par when the market yield on Government bonds was only 3% . " This was equivalent to undercutting the market price by five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand idly by . " <P> If they had , says Lanston , the Treasury issue could not have been successful , since neither banks , institutions , nor individuals had enough cash surplus to invest in Government bonds . While some speculation may have been excessive , says Lanston , the excesses tend to be self-correcting . " I am sure that a number of speculators will not want to try again soon . Their losses were too severe . " <P> Criticizing Treasury Secretary Robert Anderson 's recent appeal to non-bank institutions to check inflation by buying Government bonds , Lanston blamed the market collapse on heavy Government deficits . " Our non-bank financial institutions could not possibly absorb more than a small increment of the annual increase in federal spending . Our non-bank institutions could not save the Government from its folly-if they wanted to . "
