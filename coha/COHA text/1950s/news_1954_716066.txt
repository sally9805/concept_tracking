txt House Members said today they had information from the State Department - that only eleven of 534 employes it cut loose as security risks in the past year had been ousted Pr loyalty reasons . They reported that Gen. Walter Bedell Smith , Under Secretary of State , had told them that no active Communists had been found in the department . General Smith and Scott , Department Security Chief , supplied information on security cases at a recent secret session of a House Appropriations subcommittee . Committee members who asked not to be identified disclosed this today . The State Department cases would account for nearly onefourth of the 2,200 persons the Eisenhower Administration says lit has let out as security risks , in the last year . These cases have stirred up a boiling controversy . Democrats have been demanding a breakdown and have been contending the Administration is putting out the erroneous impression that most of the cases involved Communists or subversives left on the Government payroll by the Truman Administration . Former President Truman , in a New York speech last Friday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever attempted in American history . " Senator Wayne Morse , Independent of Oregon , said President Eisenhower was permitting use of a " Fascist big lie technique " in connection with these cases . Mr. , on a speaking trip for the Republican party , said at Mitchell , S. D. , last night that the Democrats were playing a " numbers game " in asking a breakdown of the 2,200 cases . " So far as these firings go , " he said , " I do n't think the people are // concerned with any breakdown ? they do n't care if they were drunks , perverts or Communists they just want to get rid of them . " As for the report on State Department cases to the House subcommittee , one member said : " They did n't claim to have found a single proven Communist or subversive . In the entire Voice of America operation , ' which has been a prime target of Communist hunters in the past , they have failed to find a , case of actual disloyalty or.cornmunism .

He gave no information on how many cases might have involved ! disloyalty . The subcommittee , headed by Senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper , Republican of Iowa , has been looking into the information agency and included Mr. Streibert 's testimony in a report on the inquiry . Members of the House Appropriations subcommittee said study of seven of the eleven loyalty cases in the State Department had been begun under President Truman and finished by Mr. .
