Italians agree that Enrico Mattei is some go-getter . A policeman 's son , slim , faultlessly tailored Financier Mattei in 14 years has built the state-owned ENI oil and gas monopoly from a stagnant relic of fascism into the nation 's most powerful business enterprise , a sprawling empire that also makes soap and margarine and manufactures iron and steel . But Mattei has many enemies who dislike his contempt for private enterprise , resent his roughshod methods , and fear the considerable political power he wields as ENI 's boss . <P> At the end of a senatorial look into his budget last week , Mattei was still cock of the walk , but minus a few tail feathers . Critics have often suggested a concealed ownership of the heavily subsidized Milan daily // Giorno ( circ. 150,000 ) , which has consistently backed Mattei 's causes and opposed his detractors , followed a left-of-center line , and often been hostile to actions of Premier Antonio Segni 's regime . The government consistently denied that taxpayers ' money was backing // Giorno , Last week Mario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties , stunned Senators by candidly acknowledging that ? ? Giorno does indeed belong to Mattei 's ENI oil monopoly , " as of now . " " ENI is no longer just a state within a state , " shouted one Senator , " but a state against the state . " <P> Money &; Motels . As a civil servant , Mattei was appointed head of Mussolini 's nearly defunct oil exploration agency in 1945 , with orders to liquidate it . Instead he poured money into research and discovered vast fields of natural gas in the Po Valley . Today ENI gas , pumped through 3,100 miles of ENI 's own pipelines , supplies 2,500,000 Italian families and 2,000 factories . <P> By charging high prices for the gas ( competing fuel oil must pay 24% taxes against his 14.8% ) , Mattei has some flashy results to show : he has accumulated huge sums for oil exploration , owns pipelines , a tanker fleet , a spanking new synthetic rubber and fertilizer plant , and a string of thousands of bright yellow filling stations across Italy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is also at work on an $80 million nuclear-power plant . <P> Trout &; Charity . These successes conceal Mattei 's bleak record in oil development . He has driven private oil-producing firms out of Italy , and while neglecting oil exploration in the promising Po Valley , he has scattered his capital around the Middle East , acquiring concessions in Iran , Egypt , Morocco and Somaliland , with little to show for it . He benefits from laws left over from fascism , which give his state organizations monopolistic power . <P> ENI 's assets total some $2 billion , and receipts run to $500 million annually , but exactly what it spends and earns is a mystery even to the government owners ; its balance sheet is , by Mattei custom , uninformative . With it he can buy political influence-he is a lavish contributor to the Christian Democratic Party-but Mattei , independently wealthy , lives almost austerely in a Rome hotel , turns over his salary to charity . At 53 , his main interest outside of ENI is trout fishing .
