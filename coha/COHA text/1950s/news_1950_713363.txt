Contribution to Fund Explained ? To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Now that the . election is over and the political . atmosphere somewhat less murky , it seems important to me to clarify the discussion concerning , the demands by police and , firemen that the city increase its contribution to their respective ' pension , funds . The matter will again be before the Board of Estimate on Thursday , Nov. 16 , and the facts , which up to now have been submerged in politics , should be better understood . The proposal , in the form of two amendments to the Administrative Code , is that the city , which nod contributes 55 per cent of the annual payment for pensions for police and firemen who entered the system since July 1 , 1940 , increase that contribution to 75 per cent  --  reducing the personal contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing of cost of pensions as far as substantially all other city employes are concerned . The direct annual cost to the city of the change demanded is about $1,250,000 at the outset , increasing in due course to about $5,000,000 . That , however , is only a minor part of the probable cost . Should the bills be approved , it is obvious that other city employes will demand the same treatment as a matter of decency and justice . If the city administration puts up as feeble a resistance to such demands as they are making to the demands of the police and firemen , the resultant cost will exceed $23,000,000 yearly . Take-Home Pax The alleged reason for the passage of these bills was the claim that the take-home pay of both firemen and policemen was far too little . The example given at the hearing was that of a 21-year-old rookie policeman whose salary is $3,150 , and it was alleged that his take-home pay , because of the contributions that he had to make to the pension fund , the cost of his equipment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This figure is not quite accurate ? $40 per week would be more nearly an accurate figure . Further , while it is true that the rookie has to pay the full cost of his equipment when he enters the force , after all , this is a single item , not repeated year after year . Nevertheless , the take-home pay is little enough , and might well be construed as justifying the passage ' of the bills if the real reason for the high cost of pensions were not understood . As a matter of fact , the heavy contribution to pension funds made by both police and firemen is due to one simple fact  --  namely , that their leaders insist that they must have the privilege of retiring on half pay after only twenty years of service . Using the same example that was presented at the hearing by the proponents of the measure , this rookie policeman , if still just a patrolman at the age of 41 , will be enabled to retire from the force with a pension of $2,075 for the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved promotion to sergeant or lieutenant , his pension will be far more . He can retire , ? under this system , at full pay for the rest of his life at age 55 . No other city employe shares these extraordinary privileges . The cost is inevitably very high , both to the city and to the employe . But if the police and firemen want to reduce this cost they should accept a pension plan which does not give them the privilege of retiring after twenty years of service . Nothing compels them to retire after twenty years of service . They can elect to retire after twenty-five years of service . If they made such an election , their pension contributions would be much less and.their take-home pay much more . Special Pensions The fact that the post of policeman and fireman involves serious hazard is not a sound argument for increase in the city 's pension contribution . The city covers in full at its own ? cost the extra funds needed to meet special pensions arising out of the hazard of the job  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the city 's sound obligation to the widows of those killed in service . The man incapacitated because of injury received while on duty can retire on three-quarters pay for the rest of his life , even if he has only just enlisted in the force .. The city at its own expense provides for that obligation , and of course should do so  --  but the argument that the city should increase its share of the ordinary pension fund contribution because of the need of extra coverage for which it now pays in full is without any merit . I realize , fully that there are same injustices of which both police and firemen can properly complain . I see no reason why the city should not furnish at its own expense the entire cost of initial equipment . Further , it may well be that the salaries are too low m the face of the advancing cost of living . I believe that they are . The maximum pay reached by these men seems to me shockingly low . This can and should be remedied by direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other injustices from which police and firemen suffer  --  they should be handled directly , not through a raid on the pension system . And obviously , when the city is making careful studies of the entire problem and when a subcommittee of six has been working on this specific problem under the direction of Mr. Gulick , it is fair to ask that the report of that committee be published and considered before either the Council or the Board of Estimate lakes action . Where is that report ? And what does it say ? I for one would like to be in- ' formed . Any property owner should know ? . because the figures are displayed on the back of the city 's real estate tax bill  --  that the city now contributes in its budget a total of $78,000,000 to the pension , funds . This is considerably more than double the figure of $34 , - 897,000 ten years ago . It just can not afford to add another $23,000,000 to this load  --  the minimum total cost if the city 's share of pension contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To safeguard the city 's treasury , to safeguard the various pension systems in the several branches of the city 's service , the present proposal should be rejected by the Board of Estimate . It would be sound and right , I must add , at the same time to correct existing injustices by asking the city to provide the initial equipment and by increasing salaries to the proper extent . STANLEY M. ISAAcs . New York , Nov. 9 , 1950 . An editorial on this subject appears elsewhere on this page . To Deal With Returning Nazis Reasons for Failure of Our Program to Democratize Germany Examined TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In your editorial " Nazism Again " you comment in praiseworthy terms on . he complexity of eradicating enemies Df our system of liberal government , mplying that this job requires protracted psychological attention . It must strike many of us as a surprise , however , that now , four years after the defeat of Germany , we gradually arrive at these deductions and resent the return of certain ex-Nazi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country for years indicate the failure of our denazification attempt and the return of Nazis to top positions in commerce , industry , administration , and the like . The truth remains that nations who have lived for decades under a certain mental pattern can not be reconverted by simply throwing a switch the opposite direction . We embarked on the wrong tracks by starting out to punish all the Nazis , regardless of rank , millions of them . This proved an impossible task and had to be abandoned , with the result that key Nazis got away with short prison terms ' or small fines and could resume their former position with the enhanced consideration of martyrdom . On the other side , the small nucleus of real friends of democra'bies in Germany found themselves abandoned , and their efforts to cooperate with us were rewarded by their inability to find jobs , since the Germans consider them as traitors . We should have deported from , Germany for good a few thousand ringleaders who were in the movement before the time when joining the Nazi party had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep a major position . The job of reorientation should have been placed rather in the hands of ca. pable psychiatrists in conjunction with military and civil administrators who were necessarily unfamiliar with the German mental pattern and ways of meeting these unusual problems efficiently . JOHN S. NEWSTEAD , New York , Nov. 4 , 1950 . Correcting a Traffic Hazard To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Many traffic hazards could , be easily corrected , as for example the triangle crossing at Broadway and Nagle Avenue , in the Inwood section of our dear city . This street crossing is a potential danger spot for vehicles and pedestrians alike On many occasions a woman pushing a baby carriage across to Fort Tryon Park has n't got a chance to make it in the time allowed to her by the green light , which is also the green light for vehicles lined  --  up at Nagle Avenue . A three-way traffic light would be the easy solution , of course , and until such could be installed traffic police should guard this intersection . EDGAR MARX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pony Express Suggested To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In view of the incredible delays in the mails , why does n't the Post Office Department restore the Pony Express , with a 12-cent stamp , for those who wish quick service with their letters ? I offer this suggestion gratis and with the hope that speculators wo n't buy up all available ponies in order to gouge the Government in the event the suggestion is adopted . JOSEPH FULLING FISHMAN . New York , Nov. 4. 1950.
