txt A price war in small appliances broke out yesterday , largely without the knowledge of the public . Store . executives and their professional shoppers were the principal combatants . Prices were slashed as much as- 40 per cent on some home appliances of the General Electric Company . The reductions followed an announcement that the company - was no longer fixing minimum store prices on these products . The Sunbeam Corporation , General Electric 's principal competitor in the field , notified its 12,000 wholesalers yesterday that it also had abandoned retail price fixing on many products . Sunbeam , a Chicago manufacturer , makes the Mixmaster food mixer and toasters , irons and other items that compete with those of G.E . Herman T. Van Mell , vice president and general counsel of Sunbeam , said all these had been removed from " fair trade . " This is the principle that permits manufacturers to fix and enforce minimum store prices on their products in states with " fair trade " laws . Mr. Van Mell emphasized that Sunbeam still would enforce minimum retail prices on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last night , after closing , officals at Abraham &; Straus in . Brooklyn crossed off prices on Sunbeam kitchen appliances and wrote in prices as much as 30 per cent lower . A third leading appliance line , Toastmaster , is still officially " fair traded . " But Max // , president of , Inc. , which makes the line , said yesterday that he was aware of the abandonment of " fair trade " by G. E. and Sunbeam , and added : " We ca n't fight it . We ca n't do otherwise . " Advertising in New York and Long Island newspapers today will alert shoppers to the bargains to be found at Abraham &; Straus , Gimbel 's and Masters , Inc . Store spokesmen said this was certain to set off a rush of bargain hunters today . There was no such rush yesterday . A normal number of customers strolled around stores and a few bought G. E. products at cut prices . Professional or comparison shoppers were considerably more active . They scurried in and out of stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Made . Their reports were telephoned in and their employers immediately ordered price tags changed to meet competition , The situation was summed up at 3:45 P. M. by a Macy 's salesgirl in the basement appliance department . Noddincr. at several women with eyes glued to General Electric rotisserie broilers and with pencils poised over notebooks , the salesgirl said to a customer : " This place has about twice as many comparison shoppers as real ones . " Small Merchant Glum The owner of a small midtown appliance specialty store , who asked not to be identified , said he had cut prices on his stock of G. E. appliances reluctantly . " This price war may be fine for big stores that carry everything under the sun , but it is murder for me , " the store owner said . " The big stores can draw the public in by cutting prices on General Electric appliances . They lose a little money on the G. E. stuff and make plenty by selling more ladies ' dresses and other goods on which they make a good profit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose money and so do hundreds of store owners like me . " The competition could not be compared , to the all-out price wars that raged in New York and elsewhere in 1951 . This struggle is limited to small appliances . In the summer of 1951 prices were slashed on all pricefixed items after a Supreme Court decision had voided " fair trade " all over the country . Now , makers of drugs , pharmaceuticals , tobacco , jewelry and many other products still enforce " fair trade " minimums in thirty-two states , including New York . Some of the price cuts on General Electric products made yesterday follow : Former Price Fixed Price . Yesterday . Clock radio .. $39.95 $27.95 Mixer $27.95 $19.57 Toaster $18.95 $13.27 Coffee Maker $14.95 $10.47 Cuts were made first by one store and then by another . Prices changed about every hour as shoppers detected new reductions . A. &; S. opened with prices of many appliances lower than those previously fixed by General Electric . The appliance war was not confined to this city . Polk Brothers , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appliances . Marshall Field immediately met Polk 's prices . Hess Brothers , in Allentown , Pa. , said it would join the parade after it cleared legal details . The store is under a court injunction barring cutting of " fair trade " minimums on General Electric goods . The injunction is considered academic now . Some Albany retailers also offered G. E. appliances at reduced prices during the day . Manufacturers and retailers favoring " fair trade " said they were dismayed at the General Electric action but were pressing a fight to keep the principle alive .. The National , Association of Retail Druggists said the General Electric move proved the need for a national " fair trade " law to replace state legislation .
