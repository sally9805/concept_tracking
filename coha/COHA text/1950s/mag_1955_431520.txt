 | On an eventful day in the early 1880 's an article called " What Girls Are Good For " appeared in a Pittsburgh newspaper . It expressed the usual male sentiments of that day , . which were not very flattering to aspiring womanhood . It took an especially firm stand against the new fad of hiring women in shops and offices . A respectable woman , the article said , remained home until she married . If a husband eluded her , she had two " choices " left . She could go into teaching or nursing ( if she could wangle sufficient education from her reluctant father ) . Or . if worst came to worst . she could continue to live at home , or in the home of some wealthier relative , and do household chores ( without pay ) for the rest of her natural life . Perhaps the editors were more annoyed than usual because of the inroads those " terrible women suffragettes " were making ? especially the militant Susan B. Anthony , who went striding up and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for women and equal rights . Anyone with an ounce of judgment knew that women would be as out of place in politics as they would be , for instance , in a newspaper office . Whatever the paper 's motives , on the day after publication of " What Girls Are Good For , " the managing editor , George Madden , picked up a letter from his morning mail and winced . It was anonymous , and for good reason . It was a sizzling reply to the article , a Declaration of Independence for Women ? a war cry to women to take their proper place in a man 's world and lead useful , interesting , and profitable lives . It was couched in blazing language . What 's more , it made sense !  | The handwriting was open and feminine , but surely no woman could have written the letter . It was too logical , even eloquent . But it would do no harm , thought Madden , to find out more about the writer . So he advertised in his paper for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply . The letter was written by a woman , Elizabeth Cochrane , and she lived right in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . Madden , an able editor in spite of his male prejudices , wrote Elizabeth , asking her to do an article on girls and their sphere in life . Promptly Elizabeth wrote the article and sent it in . Madden read it and paid her for it . Then he invited Elizabeth to drop around for a visit . He was totally unprepared for what happened next . Elizabeth came in with a soft rustle of skirts and a disarming aura of youthful femininity . She stepped daintily through the cluttered , masculine city room and up to George Madden 's scarred desk . Activity in the noisy office stopped dead . For here was no square-rigged suffragette . Elizabeth Cochrane was young . a slender girl standing five feet five in her carefully polished , high-button. size two-and-a-half shoes . looking scarcely more than sixteen ( actually she was almost eighteen ) . She was modishly dressed in skirt and jacket with delicate ruching at the high neckline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailor hat and had soft , reddish-brown bangs that curled around an impish oval face . She had friendly eyes of hazel brown . Her mouth was wide and generous , and when she smiled , the editor recognized a girl with a lively sense of humor . " 1 'm Elizabeth Cochrane , " she told him . " You sent for me ? " He had indeed ! Madden glanced around at his male colleagues . " How would you like to write for us regularly ? " he asked Elizabeth in a lowered voice . Elizabeth 's lovely eyes swept the growing gloom of the city room . By the flickering gaslight she saw a world inhabited on all sides by males . She knew they were thinking , What is a lady doing in a newspaper office ? in the same way they might ask , What is a lady doing in a saloon ? She knew too that the moment she left , language  | " unbefitting a lady 's ears " might be forthcoming . for she had gathered a sample of their uninhibited conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked the editor , with a mixture of childish glee and astonishment . " Write stories ? in this office ? " Mr. Madden was n't ready to go so far as that . He started to back down . He 'd see ? later . He wiped his forehead . " By the way , what would you like to write about now , Miss Coch-rane ? " " Divorce , " said Elizabeth . She spoke firmly . though this was an era when the subject was usually discussed in muted tones . " Divorce ! " Madden regarded Elizabeth with shocked amusement . What information could a girl of her tender years and upbringing have about diorce ? He could n't know that Elizabeth 's world had revolved around legal matters since infancy . Her late father had been an attorney and mill owner in Elizabeth 's birthplace . Cochrane Mills , Pennsylvania . After his death she and her mother had moved to Pittsburgh to be near her brothers , who were in the rubber business there . But it was not Elizabeth 's intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictated in the circumstances . Confident of her talent for writing , she had searched her father 's files for salable source material , and had found it in the form of a collection of documents and treatises on the growing legal problem of divorce . But now she was noncommittal . " I 'll write the article , " she said . " Then you can find out just what I do know about divorce . " Elizabeth 's article must have been highly interesting , for not only did Madden want to publish it as soon as possible ? he asked her to do a series of articles on the subject . Then he did A " journalistic daisy , " Nellie Sly an unprecedented started the race against time wearthing in the annals lag entire trip wardrobe except for of Pittsburgh jour- spare coat , contents of a single bag nalism . He told Elizabeth Cochrane that if her articles " caught on " with the readers . she might come to work on the staff at five dollars a week ! " Five dollars a week ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming in every week . she would soon be  | independent ! She would be on her way to becoming rich ! " Yes , miss ? five dollars ? if you 're worth it , " said the editor , benevolently , to this girl who , in a few short years , would be earning an estimated $25,000 a year , a truly fabulous sum in Victorian America . Elizabeth assured Mr. Madden she 'd be worth every penny of five dollars a week , and much more . She had ideas , she told him . There was no doubt about that ! The editor took a deep breath . One other matter . It seemed highly irregular for a woman 's name to appear on articles in the newspaper , especially on articles dealing with so delicate a subject as divorce . ( What would his readers think ? ) Would Elizabeth care to use an assumed name ? Archibald Blake ? Reginald Hampton ? something like that ? Elizabeth 's eyes twinkled . She told the editor she was n't particular what name was used , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somehow the name " Nellie Bly " Naas settled on ? straight from a popular melody of that day , " Nelly Bly , " composed by Pittsburgh 's most famous composer , the late Stephen Foster . THE tie-up was a hit from the beginning . All over Pittsburgh people began to ask questions : Who is Nellie Bly ? .. . Is she really a woman ? . . . Did you ever hear of a woman reporter ? ... What next ? Nell immediately became the topic for sermons pro and con in churches . Disputes about her caused brawls in barrooms , on street corners , in police stations , in law courts and business offices . The slim , brown-eyed girl with the infectious smile was soon a familiar sight , not only in the city room but ? and unchaperoned , mind you ? in the worst slum districts of Pittsburgh . She was a genius at going out and finding news . Nell became especially sympathetic to the problems of the " poor working girl " of Pittsburgh . Why must society be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nell wanted to know ? Why must they work from dawn to dark under miserable conditions ? Why must they return to crowded , dirty slums ? Why , in a country as rich in resources as America , did these people live groveling , slavish lives ? Nell was not the only person seeking the answers to these questions , but she was one of the first to focus popular attention on them . One day she approached Madden with a disarming smile and a typically " unprecedented " idea . " I want to go into the poorest homesin Pittsburgh , " said Nell . " I want to take an artist and go into factories and mills , find out how these women and children live and work , day after day . I think there 's a story there ! " And so began one of the prototypes of modern " experience " reporting . Through the maze of Pittsburgh 's winding streets went Nellie Bly and an artist ; through narrow , garbage-ridden hallways of Pittsburgh 's worst tenements they prowled , talking to prematurely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in one family , who were sent into factories almost as soon as they could walk . Sometimes she stayed on with the  | families , getting really to know them . Through dark , dirty factories and millNell prowled , interviewing foremen and sweatshop employers . Some were cruel . dishonest , and hostile ; some pathetically eager to improve conditions . Nell returned to the paper and wrote her articles . They slapped many comfortable sleepy-souled citizens in the face . Yet they aroused them . ( Nellie Bly would always arouse people ! ) Soon letters came in from the clergy , from businessmen , from suffragettes , and from the plain people . But the letters Nellie Bly liked best then , and in later years , came from the poor , who in Nell had at last found a voice for their grievances . Nell 's salary was raised , first to ten dollars a week , then to fifteen . She interviewed steel magnate Andrew Carnegie and poet James Whitcomb Riley . She got to know society people and tenementhouse people . She investigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoky city ; she reported on the new and modern Western Penitentiary in Pittsburgh , the most progressive penal institution in America at that time . She covered society weddings and lanternslide lectures , the latest play of that " radical foreigner , Ibsen , " art exhibits and rousing suffragette rallies . She knew every policeman and reporter in the city , and many a prominent citizen , by his first name . She was invited to join the newly formed Pittsburgh Press Club , a signal honor for a female . She was only nineteen . But now she began to want a larger sphere to work in . In an effort to keep his " circulation builder " on his paper , George Madden consented to let the restless Nell go to Mexico on a roving assignment . Although she was warned that the Mexican government of the time was highly unstable and that " thieves and murderers will lie in wait for you at every corner , " She set out in high spirits in the winter of 1886 , accompanied , at Madden 's insistance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were spiced with danger and excitement . With nonchalance unknown to Latin people , this clever American girl wandered unescorted everywhere . She sought out living , breathing stories for her paper ? Mexican stories , which the American newspapers of 1886 rarely got hold of . She went at will among the poor of the cities and towns , just as she had in Pittsburgh , and she reported what she saw and felt . Nell went to Veracruz by mule-drawn streetcar , the only female passenger without a male escort , and was looked upon even more askance than at other times . " But I defied the gaze of the passengers and showed them that a free American girl can accommodate herself to the circumstances without the aid of a man . " She dodged Mexican bandits ; she visited Mexican jails and discovered Americans held there ? men who had disappeared mysteriously across the border and were languishing in dank cells . starved and tortured , and who were shot in the back if they tried to escape . " Going along the streets late at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups huddled in the shadows , which on investigation will turn out to be whole families gone to bed . They are worse off by thousands of times than were the slaves of the United States . " Her horizons widened by the Mexican trip , Nellie Bly decided to leave Pitts-  | burgh and tackle the highly competitive , completely male-dominated New York newspaper field . The hub of the New York newspaper world of the eighties was ( and remained for years to come ) Park Row , known as Newspaper Row . Here was the home of the reputable New York Times , the lusty Herald , Horace Greeley 's famous Tribune , and Charles Dana 's puckish Sun . Here too , in an unprepossessing building at 31-32 Park Row , was Joseph Pulitzer 's sensational World , that blazing meteor among newspapers , which was setting a new record for interesting news coverage . IT DID not take Nell long to decide The World was her target . Its pioneering spirit appealed to her . So did its unorthodox , crusading methods . And , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception room there ; no one to eye that greatest of oddities , a female in search of a reporting job , and turn her away with the cold observation that New York City was overrun with " brilliant newspapermen in search of employment . " At The World Nell could at least get as far as the city desk ! But the day she dropped in on him , the harassed city editor listened to her with only half an ear . He went on poring over copy , shouting at office boys , and answering phones . ( The World was better supplied with these magical instruments than were most American newspapers . ) Before she could tell him much of anything , he dismissed her . Nell was able to pick up only one interesting tidbit . Pulitzer was sponsoring a balloon flight to be held in St. Louis ! Nell returned to her room and wrote a letter to Pulitzer , asking for a chance to go up in the St. Louis balloon as a girl reporter for The World . In due course she received an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . The letter made a point of saying that a man had been chosen to go up in the balloon . For emancipated Nell , this was an outright challenge . Moreover , at this low point in her life she lost her purse with almost all the money she had to her name . It was now or never ! She dressed in her most becoming gown , adjusted the veil on her sailor hat , and putting on a thumb ring as a " lucky talisman , " made up her mind she would beard Joseph Pulitzer himself in his own den . This time , as she started to enter the city room , she was intercepted by an office boy . " You here again ? " he demanded . " Yes , " said Nell with a bravado that covered her desperation . " I want to see Mr. Pulitzer ! " The boy regarded Nell with pop eyes . " Look , Miss Bly , even President Cleveland could n't get in to see Pulitzer today ! " He held her back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I intend to see him . " She moved past the boy . He appealed to the city desk . " It 's her again ! This time she wants to see Pulitzer ! " Nell found herself surrounded . Report ers and copy men blocked the path to Pulitzer 's private office . She was led firmly to the exit . She refused to leave . It tooks three hours of " selling " for Nellie Bly to effect an entrance into Pulitzer 's retreat . By this time she had worn down the entire office force . At last the man on the copy desk said wearily , " I tell you , J. P. 's not seeing anybody ? he 's in conference ? with Cockerill , the managing editor , Besides ? " He  | started for Pulitzer 's office . What was the use ? " Come along , Miss Nellie Bly . " Youthful Nellie Bly entered Pulitzer 's office , mecca of every aspiring reporter in America , looking like Miss Liberty in action . Pulitzer and Cockerill stared unbelievingly . " Nellie Bly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your real name ? " " Elizabeth Cochrane , sir , " said Nell , twisting her thumb ring . " A lady writer ! " he said mockingly . Nell felt the sting in Pulitzer 's voice . ( Even as early as the Civil War , there had been a number of " lady writers " in newspaper work . Mostly they were contributors of flowerly discourses on matrimony and other domestic matters . Actual reporting was done almost 100 per cent by men . ) She looked at him with steady eyes . " I 'm a reporter , " she reminded him . He turned on her . " What experience have you had ? " " Just about every kind , " said Nell , producing clippings . " I 've reported fires and accidents . I investigated the living and working conditions of factory women . I just came back from Mexico , where I investigated prisons , peons , and corruption in government , and " ? she added wryly ? " nearly ended up in a Mexican prison . " Poor working girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investigations ! This sort of thing was the breath of life of Joseph Pulitzer . He peered more closely at this feminine-looking girl . Her manner was incisive ; he felt the same vital spark in her that he himself possessed . But it was his nature to be purposefully cagey . " Name one idea The World might possibly be interested in ! " he snapped . Nell knew now that she had him , for she was prepared for his challenge . But with an instinctive sense of timing , she hesitated . " Well ? " Pulitzer demanded impatiently . " I want to pretend I 'm insane , " said Nell , confidently . " I want to get myself committed to the asylum on Blackwell 's Island and live there as an inmate . I have always wanted to find out how the insane poor are really treated and tell the story . I know the public would be interested ! " Pulitzer stared at Nellie Bly through his pince-nez . Insanity was a feared and misunderstood subject . For a young girl to suggest going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the terrible madhouse on Blackwell 's Island , of all places " We-l-1 , " he said , with ill-concealed eagerness . " We-1-1 , " said the overwhelmed Cockerill . I ELL came away from her interview 1- 1 with twenty-five dollars in cash . This sum was an advance on the brain storm she had left Pulitzer and Cockerill to ponder . Their decision was not reached until three days later , but Nell knew already that she had taken the great Pulitzer and his World by surprise attack ! For a coup that was to leave rival papers red-faced and fuming , the insanity assignment was given the simplest possible preparation by The World . Nell was to make plans for her " incarceration " strictly on her own . Managing-Editor Cockerill would see that she was released in about ten days . Meanwhile there must be no suspicion that she was working for The World , and The World was to print nothing about her case until she had been in and out of the asylum . Only one thing  | was decided on : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which would agree with her pen name and linen . In this way it would be easier to trail her movements and get her out . At noon the next day she presented herself at a lodging house called the Temporary Home for Females , on New York 's Second Avenue . After a long wait in a dark , uncomfortable back parlor , a frumpish woman approached Nell and asked , " Well ? " " I want to stay here for a few days , if you can accommodate me , " said Nell , noting the cheerless look of the place , so typical of homes for deserving working women Nell had been in before . The woman inspected Nell . " Where is your gripsack ? " she asked suspiciously . Nell smiled sweetly . ( Her trip to Mexico would come in handy now . ) " Senorita , I am waiting now for my trunks to arrive , " she said dramatically . " Trunks ? " asked the woman , obviously impressed . " Oh , you come from a dis-tance ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba . " Nell let the afternoon pass without incident , but the night was one that the superstitious working women at the Temporary Home for Females would long remember . " The new Cuban girl " had seemed as sane as the next one up to the time she finished her dinner . Then her brain seemed to snap . At about five r ' . nt. she ran upstairs to the sitting room , huddled up in a corner , stared blankly at the other women , then began weeping hysterically . THE landlady tried to calm her , asking her if she was in some kind of trouble . Nell wept the harder , interspersing her sobs with incoherent French and Spanish phrases . She called for a pistol to protect herself , refused to go to bed " with all these crazy women in the house , " and sat up all night with hat and gloves on . By morning the lodgers were declaring , " Poor thing ? she 's a loon for fair . I would n't stay around her for all of Vanderbilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continuing to be vague , letting her questioners build upon their imaginations , Nell convinced a policeman , a judge , and succession of doctors that her mind had snapped . She also fooled inquisitive reporters from other papers . Within one day she was taking her first look at Blackwell 's Island , and the dreadful isolation of the place appalled her . Had she gone too far in taking on this role of " crazy girl " ? Would The World ? to whom she was still an unknown quantity ? really come to her rescue ? She could only hope and wait . A matron snatched her arm roughly and pushed her into line with the other new arrivals . Soon she passed the kitchen of the asylum . The stench was overpowering ; she held her breath . Next she entered a bleak gray stone building and found herself in a barren reception room filled with " crazy women . " The patients kindly made room for her on the wooden bench . " Who sent you here ? " asked one . " The doctors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Insane ? " The woman next to her studied the youthful , pretty Nell . " It can not be seen in your face . " From this point on , according to Nell 's later reports , she no longer attempted to feign insanity . Except for continuing  | the assumed name of Nellie Brown , she behaved rationally and without pretense . To the first doctor she encountered she said , " I am not sick , and I do not want to stay here . " The doctor ignored her statement . " You play the piano ? " he asked her . " Yes ? since I was a child . " She knew he was trying to distract her as he and the nurse led her over to an old-fashioned square piano . It was hopelessly out of tune , and as Nell fingered it , the sound sent chills up and down her spine . Again she said truthfully , " How horrible . I never touched a piano as much out of tune . " " That 's a pity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get one made to order for you . " Nell sat down at the piano . She did her best to bring comfort to the pathetic group in the room . She played variations of " Home , Sweet Home , " and as the music filled the forlorn place , all talking ceased . The patients sat there quietly and attentively ; they were obviously moved . THAT evening Nell stood with the other inmates in the long , drafty hall , waiting for supper . The weather had turned cold . The patients stood about in insufficient clothing , blue and shivering . Many of them were unquestionably demented . They chattered nonsensically , talked to invisible people , laughed and cried aimlessly . One gray-haired woman nudged Nell , winking , and told her not to mind the rest , since all but she and Nell were mad . Two by two , Nell and the others were finally marched into the long , narrow dining room . By each bowl Nell saw a slice of stale bread and a saucer containing five wilted-looking prunes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the youngest there could possibly chew . A fat woman soon scooped up the allotments of bread and prunes from various places . A woman beside Nell grabbed Nell 's bread . When another patient politely offered Nell her piece , Nell thanked her , but declined . After supper the patients flocked around Nell and begged her to play for them again . She was glad enough to give them this small consolation . She knew that even more than decent food , these poor people were starved for love and beauty in their lives . But this serene interlude was soon over . Nell and a group of patients were then herded into a dismal bathroom for tubbings . A nurse yanked off Nell 's clothes and and plunged her into a cold bath . Nell protested she 'd catch pneumonia , but it did her no good . A fellow inmate was made . to scrub Nell , practically performing a sanding operation on her face and pretty long , dark hair . She then threw three buckets of icecold water over her . Dripping wet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , " Lunatic Asylum , B.I.H. 6 . " A girl who was obviously ill physically as well as mentally was next . Nell looked on , shivering and aghast , while this feverishly sick girl was given the same inhuman treatment . ( Nell noted that the bath water was not changed once , as one victim after another was given a tubbing . ) Sobbing , the girl was taken out of the tub and handed a thin flannel slip . Nell turned to the nurse angrily . " She is a  | sick girl . At least give her a warm night-gown ! " " We do n't have nightgowns here , " snapped the nurse . " This is charity ! " " But the city pays to keep up these places and pays people like you to be kind to the unfortunates brought here , " Nell protested . " Well , you do n't need to expect kindness here , for you wo n't get it . " The young girl broke under the harsh treatment . She tried to rise above her depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sanity , " according to Nell , only to have the nurses insist she " stop that noise . " In due time Nell watched convulsions overcome the girl 's tired body and spirit . " Insane ? Yes , insane , " Nellie Bly was to write with flaming righteousness . " And as I watched insanity creep over a mind that had appeared to be almost all right , I cursed the doctors , nurses , and all public institutions for their stupidity . I resolved I would by every means make my mission of benefit to my suffering sisters . Criminals are given every chance to prove their innocence . These poor , overworked girls are convicted after a few trifling questions . " Nellie Bly barely contained herself at other incidents of outrageous cruelty and neglect . In the washroom she saw gibbering women with dangerous eruptions on their faces and bodies dry themselves on the same towel used by the rest ; she formed the habit of dabbing her own face with running water and quickly drying it on her underskirt before the nurse could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw violent victims from the solitary wards chained together with a long cable . ( " They were yelling , cursing , singing , praying , and preaching as the fancy took them . Crippled , blind , old , young , homely , and pretty ? all there together . " ) On rainy days she sat with them in the barren reception hall all day long , together with the other nonviolent patients , with nothing to do . Talking and moving about were forbidden . Secret whispers were the only outlet for their thoughts and energies . " Take a perfectly sane and healthy woman , " wrote Nell . " Shut her up , make her sit from six A.M. to eight P.M. on straight benches ; do not allow her to talk or move during these hours ; let her know nothing of the world or its doings ; give her vile food and harsh treatment ; and see how long it will take to make her insane . " Two months of such a life , estimated Nell , " would have driven me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercede for these women , a nurse threatened her . " Watch your saucy ways ? or we 'll send you to The Lodge " ( a special department for the dangerously violent ) . The doctors tried no new tests to ascertain her degree of insanity , reported Nell , and as she kept insisting they do so , it was reported that Nellie Brown was raving . The one doctor who hinted that perhaps a mistake had been made was overruled . Nellie Brown 's case was " closed , " he was told . Competent doctors had declared her insane . She must remain on Blackwell 's Island ! The tenth day of her internment came and went . Then , as she started the nightly dreary march with the other forlorn creatures , a strange man , accompanied by a nurse , came toward her . " Nellie Brown , step out of line , " the nurse ordered .  | The man took her to one side . " I 'm your lawyer , " he whispered . " I was sent by The World to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Nellie Bly . The World had ignored Nell during her arraignment and detention , even though the rival papers were making capital out of headlines such as " Who Is This Insane Girl ? " That the other papers would thus play right into The World 's hands for its eventual scoop was more than even Pulitzer dared hope . He consequently fired The World 's biggest guns in revealing that the " myssterious crazy girl " was actually a World reporter getting a sensational and exclusive story . Titled " Behind Asylum Bars , " it was a voluminous story , both humorous and terrible , signed at the end of the first installment by a girl reporter called Nellie Bly . Before the series was finished , the entire country had been aroused to high indignation over the treatment accorded the insane on Blackwell 's Island . A veil had been ripped from this , the most feared and hushed-up subject on earth ? insanity . An intimate report had been presented by a twenty-year-old girl , who knew from firsthand experience what she was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " an act of humanity ? and called it " the talk of the town and nation . " Editorials in New York and most out-of-town papers commented on " the remarkable exploit of Nellie Bly . " " Nellie Bly 's stories , " the papers said , " will attract wide attention ... may lead to reforms which will be for the decided advantage of the insane . a story which will set people to thinking . . . as a bit of journalistic enterprise highly original and commendable . " On the strength of Nellie Bly 's investigation , many changes for the better were made in the management of this and other American asylums . An appropriation of $3,000,000 was given to the Blackwell 's Island asylum . Nell was taken onto the staff of The World and given free reign as a crusading reporter . Her subsequent exposes for The World led her into every corner of nineteenthcentury New York City , as well as into many other parts of America . By posing as a naive maid of all work , she investigated " employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a factory girl to show up the deplorable working conditions to which these women were subjected ; she invaded tenements that bred cholera and typhoid fever , and demanded , and got , better housing and sanitation ; she went into hospitals and dispensaries and revealed the impossible loads placed on overworked doctors , securing raises and more humane conditions for them . NELL got a job as chorus girl just for fun . She slept in a haunted house . She traveled the country over , interviewing innumerable celebrities and starving ranchers . She became the confidante of reformers , millionaires , factory owners , strikers , society women , shopgirls , and show people . Belva Lockwood , first woman candidate for President of the United States , thought Nell a " true suffragette , " though Nell marched in none of the suffragette parades . When Nell exposed mashers in Central Park , by setting herself up as " bait , " Mrs. Ulysses S. Grant laughingly confided to Nell that " my son tells me that you are a little scamp . "  | Her admirers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former President ; Mrs. Grant ; poets as different as Joaquin Miller and James Whitcomb Riley ; Buffalo Bill ; and tenement women who wrote to The World , " For God 's sake , send Nellie Bly to help us . She can do anything ! " BUT the story that fired the imagination of the entire world ? the adventure story for which she will always be remembered ? took place in the year 1889 . Jules Verne , the French writer of science fiction , had piqued public interest some years earlier with his fantasy Around the World in Eighty Days . In real life such a notion was incredible , because in the 1880 's to visit even a neighboring town frequently meant a full day 's journey . Travel of any kind was considered to be the height of adventure . Ships were slow and at the mercy of the weather . Sailings were infrequent . There was no such thing as co-ordinating what schedules did exist . So when Verne 's hero , Phileas Fogg , won a bet by circumnavigating the globe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assorted mishaps , his exploits caught and held the public fancy ( as much so as a trip to the moon , which Verne also wrote about ) . It was a situation made to order for the enterprising Nellie Bly , and the editor of The World was hardly surprised when she approached him and said , " I want to go around the world in less than eighty days . I think I can beat the record of Phileas Fogg . " In response to many letters from readers , The World had been toying with the idea of sending a man around the world to investigate the best and worst methods of travel . Now came their girl wonder , Nellie Bly , suggesting a race against an imaginary character , Phileas Fogg , who had set an " impossible record " in his race against time . " It ca n't be done , " the editor said flatly . But because of Nell 's coaxing , he put it up to the business office . They too vetoed it . " It is impossible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the first place you are a woman and would need protection in foreign countries . " " I 've been to foreign countries , " said Nell .

" There is no use talking , Nell ; this is one thing only a man could do ? if it could be done . " " Very well . Start your man , and I 'll start the same day for some other newspaper and beat him . " " I believe you would ! " The World would make no definite promise , but eventually Nell was summoned to come in and talk to Jules Chambers , then managing editor . She was asked unexpectedly , " Can you start around the world in about a day and a half ? " " I can start this minute , " said the overjoyed Nell . Nellie Bly went directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghomleys . " I want a dress by this evening , " she told them . She got it , fittings , bustle , boning , and all ? a twopiece blue broadcloth dress that could stand incessant wear and tear ? and a  | smart plaid camel 's hair teat . She also ordered an ulster , a lighter summer dress , and one satchel . At a bank she collected two hundred pounds in English gold and Bank of England notes , also some American gold and paper money to use as a test , to see how well American money was known outside the United States . On the morning of November 14 , 1889 , she went by horse-drawn stage to the Christopher Street ferry and crossed to the Jersey side . Bidding good-by to her mother , friends , and newspaper associates , she set sail on the Hamburg steamer , the Augusta Victoria , at nine forty and three seconds o'clock , bound for England .

Nell wore her two-piece traveling dress , her plaid coat , a double-peaked ghillie cap , and gloves . Around her neck was fastened a chamoisskin bag that contained money , papers , and other valuables . In her pocket was a twenty-fourhour watch set to New York time . In her lone satchel she had crammed two ghillie caps , three veils , a pair of slippers , a complete outfit of toilet articles , an inkstand , pens , pencils , copy paper , pins , needles , thread , dressing- and nightgown , tennis blazer , several changes of flannel underwear , handkerchiefs , fresh ruchings , and a jar of cold cream . Over her arm she carried a silk waterproof coat . On her wrist she wore a second watch to keep track of local time . On her left hand she wore the thumb ring she had worn when she got her first World assignment ? " a lucky talisman I would never think of going without . " Though she had seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had never been to sea before ; she had been told all kinds of horror tales about shipwrecks , fevers , and " dangerous foreigners . " As she waved good-by to America , and the Augusta Victoria moved slowly down the sparkling windy bay , her heart sank . I 'm off , she thought . Shall I ever get back ? EANWHILE The World broke the asM tonishing news to its readers that Nellie Bly had started on the first lap of her trip around the world to challenge the record of Jules Verne 's hero , Phileas Fogg . The front page of November 15 , 1889 , trumpeted the story : " A CONTINUOUS TRIP WHICH WILL GIRDLE THE SPINNING GLOBE ? NELLIE BLY TO MAKE AN UNEQUALED RAPIDTRANSIT RECORD ? NOW 30,000 MILES IN A RUSH ? CAN JULES VERNE 'S GREAT DREAM BE REDUCED BY ACTUAL FACT ? . . . The World today undertakes the task of turning a dream into reality . . Nellie Bly , so well known to millions who have read of her doings , as told by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fogg and if nothing prevents and mishaps do not lengthen the time of her travel or the time taken in covering it , will report back January 27 , in just 75 days . . When the Augusta Victoria , in spite of the stormiest crossing in years , docked in Southampton six days later , all the passengers stayed up to see Nell off on a tugboat at two thirty in the morning . She was en route to London , whence she was to proceed to Brindisi , Italy , for  | a ship bound for Suez . At London , however , Nell made the first abrupt switch in her plans . There was a cablegram there from M. and Mme. Jules Verne , inviting her to drop in on them while in France if she could possibly make it . A side trip , indeed , in this unprecedented race against time ! Nell sighed . " Oh , how I should like to see them . I must ! Do you suppose there 's a chance ? " The World 's London man shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I would n't mind that . But how about connections ? " " Well ? " Within the hour Nell had cabled her New York office that she would squeeze in a visit and interview with Jules Verne in Amiens by going there at once and catching up with her regularly scheduled train at Calais . Missing that train would end the whole project , but Nell was determined not to pass up the chance to see the Vernes . What the editors of The World thought of Nell 's gambling with a change in plans just to get an interview with Verne is not recorded . " NELLIE BLY ON THE OTHER SIDE , " they told their excited readers in front-page headlines on November 22 . " The World 's Globe Trotter Is in Southampton Today after a Tempestuous Voyage . May Visit Jules Verne in France if She Can Do So Without Losing Time . " B UT Nell had no time to worry about editors back home . She had boarded a moving train in London , crossed the cold English Channel on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to include the Verne visit in her trip . She made up her mind that this was one interview she had worked hard for and would enjoy . Jules Verne and Mme. Verne greeted her warmly at the Amiens station . As she shook hands with the incomparable Verne and his lovely wife , Nell felt " it was the most important meeting of my life , " and impressed every detail of it on her sharp mind . Jules Verne 's luminous eyes surveyed the smiling , travel-weary girl , and he said in French to his wife and interpreter , " Is it possible that she is traveling around the world alone ? Why she is a mere child . " " Jules Verne had snow-white hair , " Nell wrote . " He was about five feet five with long beard and his heavy hair fell in artistic disorder . He had brilliant black eyes and heavy white brows . " Mme. Verne was equally charming . " She had luminous black eyes , a youthful face , spotless complexion and the whitest of hair ; pretty red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sealskin jacket and carried a muff . She wore a small velvet bonnet . She wore a wateredsilk skirt , laid in sideplaits in front and full straightback drapery bodice of black silk velvet . " Nell was whisked in a fine carriage to the Verne estate , where the party went up marble steps , through a beautiful conservatory , and entered a large sitting room . The hangings were of soft velvet . On the mantel were fine pieces of statuary in bronze , and on the wall a Louis Quinze clock ticked off the time ? twenty minutes past four o'clock . There were fireplace chairs in brocaded silk , and a fine Angora cat , which Mme Verne stroked with dainty white hands .  | Nell spoke through an interpreter . " Has Monsieur Verne ever been to America ? " she wanted to know , for some of his stories had American locales . Verne 's expressive eyes filled with Gallic delight . He spoke in short , rapid sentences . " Once . For a few days only , during which I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return , he added , and had had many letters from friends in the States , but his health these days prevented long journeys . Jules Verne chuckled at the audacity of this unchaperoned pretty American girl . " But why do you not go to Bombay , as my hero Phileas Fogg did ? " Nell 's eyes twinkled . " Because I am more anxious to save time now than to rescue a young widow " ( as Verne 's Phileas Fogg had done ) . " You may save a widower before you return , " he countered , laughing . Mme. Verne joined in the laughter and said , haltingly , she hoped pretty Nell would find a handsome husband on her tour , but Nell shook her head . She would be too busy catching trains and boats from here on , she told them , to worry about catching a husband . Nell saw that time was flying . There was only one train she could take from there to Calais , and " if I miss it , " she told the couple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the way I came . " She stood up , then hesitated and said , " But before I go , I should like to see the study , if Monsieur Verne would not consider it impertinent . " " Certainly , " said Jules Verne , beaming . He lit a tall wax candle and with a slight limp went through the conservatory and up a winding spiral staircase . He opened a door off the hall . " I had expected to see rare etchings , hand-carved desks filled with trinkets , " Nell wrote , " but I saw only one latticed window in a small room , modest and bare , with a flat-topped desk . There was no litter anywhere . " On the desk was the manuscript of Verne 's latest novel , Sens Dessus , Dessous . ( It told the story of Americans who , for the sake of speculation , made an attempt to change the axis of the earth so as to make fertile gardens out of polar regions . It told of Americans seated in their own living rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) " A purely imaginary story , " Jules Verne said wistfully . Mme. Verne kissed Nell on both cheeks , and she and her husband went out into the icy courtyard to see their visitor off . In the distance Nell heard the train whistle . Her watch said she still had half an hour before traintime . But English and French trains , she was learning , were unpredictable . Could it be that the one train for Calais that week was ahead of schedule ? " Hurry , " she told the coachman frantically . " I simply must be on that train ! " THE whole civilized world is watching Nellie Bly , " said The World . While rival New York papers agreed with the British that a mere woman could hardly be expected to beat the record of the remarkable Phileas Fogg , the out-of-town American press was rooting for Nell 's success . The Auburn , Maine , Gazette acclaimed Nell " a journalistic daisy , " and the Pennsylvania papers whooped it up for their native daughter in prose and verse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scranton Sun . " She is a pioneer of her sex . "  | More and more mail poured into The World , with all kinds of hints , suggestions , and proposals of marriage for " darling Nell . " Songs and verses were hastily composed . A Nellie Bly game was invented , and then another and another . A ladies ' wrapper was named the " Nellie Bly wrapper . " This was only the beginning of the Nellie Bly boom . But Nellie Bly. seated in a private compartment of the Brindisi mail train , with two strangers for companions , one a Frenchman , the other an Egyptian , knew nothing of this boom . She felt more and more cut off from all that was happening back home . She had been stared at by one too many " foreigners , " and now , as she glanced out of the train window , she felt the strangers ' eyes taking in her unchaperoned state with great boldness . Anything could happen , in a European private compartment , she thought , shivering from cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later noted , " Small wonder the American girl is fearless . She does not have to endure being shut up in the so-called private compartments of the European railway with strangers . How much safer and more comfortable are the open coaches back home . There is safety in crowds . No wonder European girls need chaperons ! " That night Nell went to the sleeping section , thankful there were twenty-two passengers to keep her company there . She was told that " bandits held up this train last week , " and on this pleasant bedtime story got into her berth , pulling all her clothing over her to keep from freezing . IN SPITE of the seemingly snaillike progress of the mail train , it was only two hours late in reaching Brindisi . And most unexpected surprise of all , the Pacific and Oriental steamer Victoria was in port , ready and waiting for passengers ! Riding in an omnibus to the pier , Nell followed her companions up the gangplank . " I dreaded meeting all the English people on this boat with their muchtalked-about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be in bed , as it was after one in the morning . " But a crowd of men on board dispelled Nell 's hopes . Nell looked around for the purser and found none . Finally " with the aid of an unintroduced Englishman who dared speak to me , " the purser was located . She handed him a letter of introduction explaining she was " traveling alone and should be given all the care and attention it is in your power to bestow . " The purser read the letter with aloofness , then directed Nell to the wrong stateroom . Finally , she was relocated in another stateroom and found her companion to be " a sweet New Zealand girl traveling with her brother , full of fun and life . " Nell asked the purser whether she would have time to go to the cable office . " If you hurry . " She started down the gangplank and met the friendly train guard , who offered to show her where the cable office was . She followed him along dark , narrow streets for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dingy room lit by one smoky lamp . Eventually a sleepy-eyed operator appeared . " What can I do for you ? " " I want to send a cable to New York City . " With the aid of books and other documents , the operator figured the cost of  | sending the cable . But precious time was consumed before Nell finally sent her last European message to The World . With five minutes to spare , Nell hurried on board the Victoria and found herself cut off from all contact with her beloved " upstart country , the U. S. A. " For here , in this floating world more completely dominated by English ideals and customs than was even the continent of Europe , she was made more acutely aware than ever of how faraway and unimportant America seemed to the rest of the globe , and of how powerful Queen Victoria 's Britannia really was . MEANWHILE The World editors made M full capital of Nell 's adventures . They discussed monsoons , typhoons , and siroccos , and reported that another steamer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They reminded their readers that even though Nell " had crossed Europe like a swallow , " and made extraordinary time because of good luck and her own indomitable fortitude , there were untold obstacles ahead of her . A guessing contest was now launched , with a round trip to Europe and fifty English pounds as the grand prize . Soon everybody in America seemed busy trying to figure out the exact time it would take Nellie Bly to circumnavigate the globe . Shopgirls , society women , businessmen , clergymen , senators , and the ex-governor of Louisiana , were among the busy guessers . Many thought Nell would do well to come through in one hundred days ( if she did come through ! ) . A few thought she could do it in eighty , as Phileas Fogg did ; an even fewer , in seventy-five days . An office staff was now kept busy answering queries about Nellie Bly 's life . She was a pretty brunette , said The World , " quiet and reserved . " She loved horseback riding . No , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl , not a man , as many people still insisted . Yes , there really was a girl named Nellie Bly , working on The World . Yes , there were a few other girl reporters in America ? a very few . ( One " lady writer , " named Elizabeth Bisland ? a magazine contributor , not a reporter ? had actually started another trip around the world in competition against Nell , but failed . ) No , Nellie Bly was not hiding out in New York ? she actually was on the high seas ! Had Nellie Bly ever been in love ? That , avowed The World , was something they would not discuss . At Brindisi Nell made a frantically close connection with the steamer Victoria , bound for Suez . There was also much speculation about her on the Victoria . When she had been at sea for two days , she found herself being pursued by numerous gentlemen , some obviously fortune hunters . She discovered that the ship 's purser , who was something of a gossip , had spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heiress traveling around the world unescorted with only a toothbrush and a bankbook . " One languid evening , as she sat on deck listening to the passengers sing " Who 'll Buy My Silver Herring ? " a particularly insistent suitor took her arm and walked her to a secluded nook . Pointing out the mystery and beauty of the Mediterranean , he asked Nell to marry him . When Nell hinted there might be some ulterior motive for his sudden courtship , he admitted with British candor that there was . He was a sec-  | ond son , he told her , and his brother would get both the money and family title . Therefore , he must find a wife who would settle a thousand pounds a year on him . " But I 've grown to love you , " he added quickly . Nell eyed him mischievously . " Would you love me as much if you found I was not a wealthy American heiress ? but only a poor girl being sent around the world for my health by a benevolent society ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That accounts for your inadequate wardrobe . " But her inadequate wardrobe brought her another unique proposal . There was an impeccably groomed gentleman on board who had traveled since he was nine years old . " I always killed the desire to love and marry , " he told Nell , as he asked her to become his wife , " because I never expected to find a woman who could travel without trunks and bundles innumerable . " Since Nell had observed his faultless grooming and the fact that he changed three times a day , she asked him curiously , " How many trunks do you have ? " " Nineteen . " " No wonder you need a wife with one gripsack ! " But most of the companions Nell met on board the Victoria were congenial and without ulterior motive . Her pretty New Zealand roommate introduced her to a number of people , and neither she nor Nell lacked for attentive escorts . BACK in America , the Nellie Bly guessing match continued to flourish . Outof-town dealers could not get enough copies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But December 10 , the day the Victoria was scheduled to arrive at Colombo , Ceylon , came and went , and where was Nellie Bly ? The World was worried . Either the cable service in the Orient was worse than feared , or Nell had been shanghaied , lost at sea , or who knew what . December 14 , The World , after trying to contact her , admitted to its waiting public , " No message has been received from Nellie Bly , but very probably she has sailed from Colombo . " The World kept up its own spirits and those of its readers by improvising tales of what Nell " had probably seen while on the Isle of Ceylon , and would see in Singapore . " " Did she see the Buddha 's tooth and collarbone ? " asked The World . " Will she see the gorgeous Buddhist temples in Singapore ? She may ride in a native calamarian , go berrying in coffee fields or join in an elephant hunt . She can ride on a howdah on the back of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had encountered a series of delays , due to weather and slow cargo transfers in the ship she was to take , and had deferred cabling her paper until she could give them something specific to go on . In those days of slow and unreliable communications , it was more prudent to send no message at all than one that would have to be corrected . At Colombo she was waiting out the delay by having rather a good time . Behind the blue harbor was a high mountain , Adam 's Peak . A forest of tropical trees lined the beach . Everybody lounged around the hotel grounds during the day ; " the men smoked and consumed gallons of whiskey and soda , and perused  | old newspapers ; the women sipped cool lime drinks , read novels or bargained . " Dresses were cheaper than in America . Nell bought a summer gown ? " better than Worth 's " ? for five rupees ( about two and a half dollars ) . " For the first time since leaving America , I saw American money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colombo and commands a high price ? as jewelry ! It goes for nothing as money . When I offered it in payment for my bills , I was told it would be taken at 60 percent discount . The Colombo diamond merchants are very glad to get American twentydollar gold pieces , and pay a high premium for them . The only use they make of the money is to put a ring through it and hang it on their watch-chains for ornaments . The richer the merchant , the more American gold dangles from his chain . " She had made some pleasant acquaintances while on shipboard : a Spanish consul , " a jolly Irish lad , " the New Zealand girl and her brother . and soon she was on friendly terms with the Englishman who ran Ceylon 's one newspaper and who gave Nell " quite a whirl . " All of these now knew the object of her journey around the world and did their best to cheer her up . After dinner everybody went driving or bicycle riding . Colombo reminded Nell of Newport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicts , were the finest she 'd ever seen . With her editor-escort , she rode by moonlight in a bullock hackery to the Uarsee Theatre . She rode in her first jinrikisha to see the temples of Colombo , and met the famous high priest of Ceylon , who surprised Nell by saying he had converts in far-off America . FROM Colombo to Yokohama was a kaleidoscope of adventures , delays , short cuts , suspense , both for Nell and a waiting audience that was by now worldwide . The pretty young girl who dared explore the world alone caught everyone 's imagination . With ship 's officers and consular officials eager to escort her , Nell saw all there was to see of life , luxury , and misery in the various ports of call , a rarity indeed for any woman traveler . In Singapore she bought a monkey , which stayed with her all the way back to New York . In Canton , China , where she spent Christmas Day halfway round the world from home , she reported that " the women and children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I passed by . " Then she went on to report the gruesome , revolting sights she beheld in the torture chambers of Canton 's Temple of Horrors . One of the ships she was on very nearly went down in a terrifying storm . Nellie Bly arrived at her last foreign stop , Yokohama , with all but twenty-seven of her seventy-five days used up . She was met by a Japanese newspaperman , who showed her a copy of The New York World . The Verne interview had been translated into Japanese , and she learned for the first time of the stir her trip was creating at home . Whether the tour could be completed in time would depend now on what luck befell the liner Oceanic , which was to carry Nell from Yokohama to San Francisco , and on any train delays from San Francisco eastward . In Yokohama there was high excitement aboard as the Oceanic sailed on January 7 . The ship band played " Hail , Columbia , " " Home ,  | Sweet Home , " and " The Girl I Left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written over the engine : " For Nellie Bly We 'll win or die ! " " Everything went marvelously until the third day out , " wrote Nell . " The Oceanic was 110 miles ahead of its last mark . Then came terrible storms , and the next day was dreadful ? with head winds , high rolling and pitching . In spite of the best efforts of the crew , the ship could make little headway . " " If I fail , " Nell told the chief engineer , " I will never return to New York now . I would rather go in dead . " The sailors now began to blame the weather troubles on the Singapore monkey Nell had brought . " Monkeys are Jonahs , " they told her . " You 'd better throw that monkey overboard . " But jinx or no jinx , Nell refused to part with it . Somehow the Oceanic steamed into San Francisco Bay on January 21 , leaving Nell a comfortable margin for the train ride from San Francisco . But there was one last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board , and the ship 's purser discovered he had left the bill of health behind in Yokohama . " What does that mean ? " asked the frantic Nell . " We will have to wait in harbor for two weeks , until the next boat arrives from Japan . " " Never , " said Nell . " I 'll swim ashore first ! " But Nell did not have to swim . The girl who had carried the day with redoubtable Joseph Pulitzer and talked her way into and out of the Blackwell 's Island madhouse was not going to be stopped by mere red tape , not on the eve of her greatest triumph . All technicalities dispensed with , Nell was placed on a tug with luggage and monkey . She stuck out her tongue for ( and no doubt at ) the quarantine doctor , and the boat puffed away from the Oceanic toward San Francisco 's shore . N EVER in her rosiest dreams could Nellie Bly have pictured the ovation she would receive as she set foot on American soil again . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her arrival , and neither apparently had most of the rest of the nation . On hand to greet her were the mayor , the San Francisco Press Club , suffragette groups , and most of the populace . She was showered with fruit , flowers , speeches , songs , cheers , and hurrahs , while the band played " My Nellie 's Blue Eyes " and " The Girl I Left Behind Me . " " There 's no place like home , " said a radiant , sun-browned Nell as she faced the first of her innumerable American crowds . " For sixty-eight days I 've been flying around the world and am once more back in America . The saddest sounds were the farewells called from the Hoboken pier ? the sweetest sounds the words of welcome and applause in San Francisco . " With that , Nell was whisked ( together with luggage , frisky monkey , presents , fruit , and flowers ) to the station of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad , there to begin the last lap of her race against time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been acclaimed as homecoming Nellie Bly was acclaimed on her hazard-  | ous , thrilling ride East . At every whistle stop , every hamlet , village , and city , the American people were waiting for this girl who was making a dream come true . Indians waved to her ; ranchers and their families came miles to see her . As Nell 's train sped out of Kansas , suffragettes shouted after her to come back there someday and run for governor . Once the engineer let her ride in the cab and take the throttle . In Chicago members of the Chicago Press Club whisked her off to a breakfast reception between trains . There she was handed a message from Jules Verne , brimming over with Gallic good wishes . ( Verne had reason to feel good . Nellie Bly was bringing him luck , as she had brought luck and happiness to so many others . His book , Around the World in Eighty Days , had gone into its tenth new printing . ) NELL 'S train steamed triumphantly into Jersey City , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were beside themselves with excitement . The station was jam-packed as Nellie Bly 's train lurched to a stop . The police tried to push back the mobs , but they pressed forward for a glimpse of America 's first daughter . She jumped down on the grimy planking , waving her ghillie cap , eyes shining . Three stop watches recorded the historic moment . 3:51 P.M. " She 's a winner ! She 's a winner ! " the timekeepers shouted hoarsely . " Time : Seventy-Two Days , Six Hours , Ten Minutes , and Eleven Seconds ! " " She 's a winner ! She 's broken every record ! " roared the people . Now there was no holding them back . They surged forward again eager to touch this miracle girl , Nellie Bly , who had circled the globe , not in eighty days , as Phileas Fogg had done , not in seventy-five days , as she had promised , but in a little more than seventy-two days . It is almost impossible , in our present era of jet planes and luxurious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nellie Bly 's pioneer achievement . Since time began , no one had made a trip around the world in anywhere near this short a time ! The mayor of Jersey City tried to make himself heard . " The American girl can no longer be misunderstood , " he cried out . " She will be recognized as determined , independent , able to take care of herself wherever she may go . You have added another spark to the great beacon light of American liberty . People the world over have been taught that they are not as far apart as they imagined . . You have set the whole world to thinking about it and so have brought mankind closer together . Welcome home ? Nellie Bly ! " " FATHER TIME OUTDONE ! " screamed next morning 's headlines in The World . " Even imagination 's record pales before the performance of The World 's Globe Circler ! " In France , although no French girl would have dared to try so unconventional a feat as going around the world alone , the newspapers were mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Extraor-dinary ! " London papers said , " It is an idea none but an American newspaper could have conceived , and none but an American girl could successfully have carried out . "  | And The Geographic Society of New York asked , " What next for Nell ? the moon ? " What was next for Nell was not the moon but a new era of solid success as a reporter , writer , and lecturer . With her regular salary augmented by syndicate earnings and fees for lectures and innumerable testimonials , her income for the next several years is thought to have averaged $25,000 , and this in an era of no radio , no television , no movies , and practically no personal taxes . Socially she became one of the most sought-after girls in America . Professionally she established herself still further as a reporter , not merely on a stunt basis but for quality performance in a field where women were still largely unaccepted . In steady succession she covered stories on bomb-throwing anarchists , on politicians good and bad , on strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the racing season . She went to Washington to report on and personally interview the demagogic Jacob Coxey , Populist , whose " army " of unemployed had marched on Washington for a workers ' unemployment demonstration ( with incredible privation , according to Nell , while Coxey and his adjutants slept in fine hotel rooms ) . At the climax of the riotous railroad strike in 1894 , Nell went , at considerable personal peril , to a railroad company 's " model " village , where the seething discontent of the starving workmen 's families gave her one of the most provocative stories of her career . She did a series of political exposes as part of The World 's successful campaign to oust the then corrupt Tammany Hall from power in New York City . On one occasion she was sent to the Democratic convention to interview the Tammany chiefs ? a ticklish assignment , since the tough Tammany leaders were anything but friendly to The World . Applying the magical charm for which she was now justly famous , she was warmly received as an avowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories on the Tammany people . At this point The World delighted its readers with a cartoon showing a subdued Tammany tiger being led away on a chain by a gaily determined Nellie Bly . THE matter of falling in love seemed for a long time to be the one thing that Nellie Bly was not going to bother about , although in that romantic time the notion that a girl might go husbandless when she was rich , young , beautiful , and intelligent was almost more than the public could bear . Popular comment linked her name first with one suitor and then another , as she was duly escorted to the opera or the theatre by various young men . Her most serious attachment during this period was James Metcalfe , then editor of the old Life , who had spoofed her round-the-world trip in a series of articles called " Sadie McGinty and her trip around Manhattan Island . " They were seen together more and more frequently and were regarded as an " ideally matched " couple . It was more or less taken for granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost twenty-eight , settled this phase of her life with the same kind of dramatic abruptness that had characterized her earlier exploits . With virtually no ad-  | vance notice , she became the bride of Robert Seaman , a seventy-two-year-old millionaire bachelor she had met casually on a train ! There would have been speculation about Nellie Bly , no matter whom she married . But because of the great difference in ages , even an editor on her own paper implied that Nell was interested primarily in marrying a fortune . Yet by the standards of her day , Nellie Bly was already wealthy in her own right when she met the millionaire . Nor had she lacked for wealthy suitors closer to her own age . Undoubtedly the relentless grind of newspaper work , with its hazards and uncertainties , made it appear to Nellie Bly as she approached the thirty mark that her distinguished businessman husband offered her a more substantial future than did newspaper life . How many mornings she had risen before dawn to catch trains ; how many deadlines she had faced only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around newspapers since she was eighteen . She had seen countless newspapermen , unable to withstand the pressures of this fascinating business , worry themselves to death or oblivion in a handful of years . Tracing the course of Nellie Bly 's career , there would appear to have been other reasons too for her attraction to Robert Seaman . She had always seemed most at ease in the company of men considerably older and more sophisticated than she was . Then too , since her return , Nell 's interest in business ? whetted by her coverage of capital and labor issues of the day ? had been an absorbing one . And Robert Seaman was not only on the order of some of the older men Nell had found congenial in the past , but he was also a highly respected businessman . He had worshiped Nell from afar for some time , following her unusual career with great admiration . Like Nell , he had worked his way to the top . His family background was quite similar to hers . He was cosmopolitan and cultivated and appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indication that the marriage to Robert Seaman was happy . As the wife of a millionaire , Nell became a gracious hostess in her beautiful New York residence at 15 West 37th Street , entertaining not only her husband 's friends and business associates , " the millionaire crowd , " but people from all walks of life . Statesmen came , and reformers and working girls . Newspaper people , of course , were among her favorite visitors , notably Arthur Brisbane , who had worked with Nell on The World . Robert Seaman and Nell found time for travel too . They made many trips abroad . Nell 's rugged round-the-globe jaunt in 1889 had helped inaugurate many improvements in world travel , and they journeyed in comparative luxury now , thanks to her own pioneering venture . THE spectacular part of the Nellie Bly story ended when Robert Seaman died in 1904 after nine years of marriage . Nell attempted without success to carry on his manufacturing business . She gave it her usual unflagging energy ; but for various reasons the company drifted slowly toward bankruptcy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Europe and a rest , tired  | and ill , and almost immediately found herself caught in the maelstrom of World War I and was barricaded in Austria for the duration of the war . Twenty-five years earlier Nell would have relished the key position in which she now found herself . But not now . In 1919 she returned to America , and at the invitation of her old friend , Arthur Brisbane , joined the staff of The New York Evening Journal . She again crusaded for reforms , mostly having to do with children and social welfare . In 1920 she caused one more stir by covering the execution of a murderer with a story attacking capital punishment . But it was a strange newspaper world that this older Nellie Bly had returned to . Thanks in part to Nell 's own trail-blazing youth , girl reporters were no longer a novelty . She had lived to see the once sacrosanct city rooms open wide to countless able young women , but the old spark was gone , the Nellie Bly boom a thing of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pneumonia early in 1922 . She died after a brief illness , still in harness , doing the work she loved best . There were no close survivors and no headlines , and only modest obituaries appeared . The Journal , however , paid her a tribute she would have liked . It said , simply , " She was considered the best reporter in America . "
