The war in Korea has focused the news spotlight on some faces that have long been familiar to TIME readers - especially in times of trouble . This week General Bradley makes his fourth appearance on TIME 'S cover . Last week Joseph Stalin was there for the eighth time . A fortnight ago General MacArthur turned up for his seventh cover . Each of their cover portraits is reproduced below with a characteristic quotation from the stories about them - a partial record of what TIME has been saying about these news figures over the last two decades . <P> Cordially yours , <P> MAY 1 , 1944 , a month before Dday . Said TIME : " Just before he left the ground troops divisional bivouac area in the south of England , he General Bradley made a short speech to all the officers of the division .. . He did not tell these officers that their task would be easy . He did tell them that their country was giving them the best of weapons , planning , air and naval support . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hands . They must be fit , know their weapons , use their skill and wits . They must have confidence in themselves ; then their men would have confidence in them . Omar Bradley , who is no orator , ended with a plain promise that had the ring of more than oratory : ' I will see you on the beaches . ' " <P> Dec. 4 , 1944 , during the Cologne Offensive . Said TIME : " Nothing in the immediate prospect before Omar Bradley directly suggested the end of a war , or even the end of a campaign . But in the eye of his keen , analytical mind General Bradley could see beyond the belching , jerking guns , the wallowing tanks , the struggling infantrymen . The armies on the south flank of the Allied Line were moving faster than he , because they were exploiting a weakness which already existed . Bradley was busy creating a weakness-one which may be fatal to Germany . " <P> April 1 , 1946 , when Bradley was head of the Veterans Administration . Said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 53-year-old Omar Bradley-in his plain face and sense of humanity . Once , musing on a soldier 's life , he observed that he had spent 30 years training himself to make decisions which would cost human lives . ' You do n't sleep any too well from it , ' he said quietly . Now the General 's job is patching up shattered lives . . . The hazards and responsibilities of this peacetime assignment , in some respects , are greater than any he ever had in wartime . But the General sleeps better - and millions of U.S. veterans could sleep better because he is on the job . " <P> MARCH 25 , 1935 , just after Congress had passed an increased appropriations bill for the War Department . Said TIME : " Every year since he became Chief of Staff in 1930 , General Douglas MacArthur had vainly pleaded for funds to build the military establishment up to what he considered minimum requirements . . . Said he : ' Unless we move quickly we 'll be a beaten nation paying huge indemnities after the next war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
