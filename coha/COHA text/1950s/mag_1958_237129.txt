Frenchmen are drinking themselves to death at a faster rate than ever . Dr. Guy Godlewski , a Paris hormone specialist , told the French Academy of Medicine last week that after wartime 's austerity , the number of deaths from cirrhosis of the liver quadrupled from 1947 to 1950 , tripled again by 1956 . The peak total that year : 20,279 deaths from alcoholism , 14-176 of them from cirrhosis . Cause of the trouble is not hard liquor , said Dr. Godlewski , which most Frenchmen use sparingly , but ordinary red wine , or le gros rouge . Alcoholism is not the only contributing cause of cirrhosis , and may not lead to it at all if the rest of the diet is properly balanced . But the cause-and-effect relationship in France is so clear and so common that he calls cirrhosis of the liver la maladie du gros rouge . The vast majority of 8,000 victims studied had drunk two to three quarts of the stuff every day .               @ @ @ @ @ @
