" References to Others The speech , made by LohI man while he was chairman ofA the state parole board on Nov. 12 , 1952 , also contained referfi ences to the legal profession , the press , and the church , which have caused Stratton to call Lohman unqualified for 4 the office of sherif .

" nials and suggestions that the recording of the speech was faked .

Copies Made on Tape Stratton has acknowledged that the original recording was on wire , and that several copies have been made on tape , one of which lie played for reporters last Friday . A person high in the Stratton administration said that the tape copies were made to preserve the original from possible theft , breakage , or erasure thru mishandling . Stratton 's original release of the contents of the speech he attributed to Lohman has become the major sensation of this political campaign . After the Wednesday hear ? ing , Stratton said in his formal statement , Mr. Lohman will be asked to make an " apo/ogy . " " He has spoken of me in terms of ' damn liar , ' ignoramus , " perpetrator of a criminal hoax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois a monstrous eriMinal fraud , ' Stratton said . Taken From Official Files " It is apparent by now that he has tried to deceive the press and the public this last week . I have produced from the . official *files of the state department of public safety in Lohman 's own voice a recording of his views on law enforcement which so disqualified Mr. Lohman from holding flip . 10 , fice of sherif that he has used every means to deny the existence of such a record . " On Saturday , Oct. 13 , Mr. , Harvey Long. , a colleague of Mr. Lohman as superintendent of the division of supervision of paroles , while Lohman was chairman of the parole a ri d pardon board in the same department , publicly stated that he.heard this recording played in the parole board office the day after Lohman made the speech. , " Long further stated that these views of Lohman 's bad caused great resentment at the time among the personnel assigned to the office . Lohman Denies Insult " Incredibly enough , even Lohman himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a record has now actually pro- ' duckl the man , a former state employe , who made the record . ing on Nov. 12 , 1954 . " In view of the ideas expressed in the authenticated official record and his actions ? this past week , it only remains now for Mr. Lohman to make this ? apology to me for his unfounded references and disavow his candidacy for sherif of Cook county . " Lohman , in a Saturday night television appearance denied he has insulted policemen 's wives in the 1932 speech and accused Stratton of making public a " distorted and garbled " version of the speech . He accused Stratton of filching words ? out of the speech and shaping them into a " foul phrase . " On his TV program Lohman introduced Samuel Meyers , who said he made the recording and turned it over to Long . In an interview , Long said he played the recording the next day and found it both valueless and inflammatory , deciding not to have it transcribed by a stenografer . Long said that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office when he left that position in 1953 . Ile is now a member of the state youth commission . Principals Clash Again Lohman , who earlier had suggested that Stratton play the wire before the Chicago Bar association or crime commission , issued a statement saying : " Gov . Stratton 's pathetic statement only makes it clear for all to see that his wrecking crew has rerecorded on wire the hoax which had been put together on tape . . . . They stand indicted by the facts and their own statements . What is alleged to be an ' original ' wire is only a rerecorded wire of their immoral deed . " Gov . Stratton immediately replied to Lohman , asserting : " Lohman is wrong again . The wire recording is much clearer , contains background noises and even the rustling of Lohman 's notes , which did not reproduce on the tape copy . If the wire had been a copy of the tape , it would have been duller , not clearer . " CALLS DENIAL A LIE ? Lt. Gov . Chapman charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lie and said there was no question about Lohman 's voice on the recording . Chapman addressed a breakfast meeting of the Lincoln-Dembltz Republican league in the Morrison hotel . " I worked with Joe Lohman for 2t : years and if anyone knows his voice , I , know it , " Chapman said . " I never knew about that recording until I heard it last Friday . There is n't any doubt about it being Lohman 's voice . " Chapman was a holdover member of the parole board during the first four months that Lohman was chairman . For the next two years , Chapman was a hearing officer for the board . Chapman said that one section of the Lohman speech be-1 fore parole agents concerned perversion . The lieutenant governor said that Stratton had asked reporters in Springfield not to refer to " things so vile . that they would be unfit for the public to read . " Asked to Attend For Lohman Chaptnan said that Lohman was n't telling the truth in his denial and said the nominee for sherif was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truman and Adlai E. Stevenson . He called Sen. Douglas , rushing for reelection , the " biggest humbug of all . "
