At one point in La Bohme , Rodolfo , the tenor lover , sings out : " Who am I ? -I am a poet ... In poverty I yet indulge myself like a Grand Seigneur in rhymes . . . " When Richard Tucker sings those lines he can partly mean them : in his eight years at the Metropolitan Opera , he has been privately amusing himself by writing doggerel . Last week Tucker gave out some samples : <P> Dear Mimi , sweet Mimi Of La Bohme fame , Face , pretty as a picture , And gosh ! What a frame ! <P> Carmen could be charmin ' , Knittin ' and darnin ' , But we prefer , most of us guys , A Carmen who 's pulling the wool over our eyes . <P> Poor disappointed Don Carlo , Wanting a Queen for his doll-o , Found that his midnight visitor Was only the Grand Inquisitor . <P> And a final one for the boss : <P> Ode to Rudolf Bing " For he I sing ! " <P> Says Doggereleer Tucker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
