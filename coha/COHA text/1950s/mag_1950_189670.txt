Argentina 's energetic little Finance Minister , Ramon Cereijo , bounced aboard his FAMA plane at New York 's Idlewild Airport one morning last week , and flew homeward with gladsome news . Argentina had been promised $200 million in U.S. Government and private bank credits . A formal announcement was expected within a few days . <P> Some $125 million of the credits already had been approved by President Truman 's National Advisory Council . All of that sum will go to liquidate Argentina 's outstanding commercial debts and help re-establish her good credit abroad . In addition , friendly , persuasive Cereijo had got a promise of $75 million from the National City Bank and Chase National Bank of New York , and the First National Bank of Boston , to finance future purchases of badly needed farm machinery from U.S. manufacturers . <P> If U.S. bankers and Government officials had ever felt reluctant about extending Argentina credit , that feeling had evaporated . At least six U.S. Government agencies-the Departments of State , Commerce and Treasury , EGA , the Federal Reserve Bank and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Department hoped that this economic assistance might also help to make Argentina a better political risk . But that remained to be seen .
