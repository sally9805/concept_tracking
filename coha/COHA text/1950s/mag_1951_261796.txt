Inishmurray is a 100-acre sliver of rock off the northwest coast of Ireland 's County Sligo . In World War I , a British destroyer mistook its low-lying shape for a German submarine , let fly with a torpedo . The explosion shook the island up a bit but it failed to deflect the inhabitants from the pursuit of customs stemming back to the time of Saint Columba , who is said to have stopped off at Inishmurray on his way to convert Scotland to Christianity . <P> Among the customs to which the inhabitants have clung down through the ages is that of having their own righ , or king . Michael Waters , a cultivated man , sometimes scoffed when visitors called him the King of Inishmurray , but he was connected , through his grandmother 's first marriage , with the O'Heraghty family . As far back as anyone could remember , the O'Heraghtys had been rulers of Inishmurray . King Michael , a man of powerful physique and strong will , carried on the O'Heraghty tradition . Said one islander : " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he settled a dispute , he settled it properly . " <P> Michael 's Inishmurray had no police , no magistrate , no roads , no shops &shy; and no taxes . Although a lone Protestant resident , a schoolteacher who spent a short time on the island in the early 1800s , was held responsible for " the land losing its fertility and the fish forsaking the shore , " the islanders went on potting lobsters , growing vegetables and grazing cattle . They were safe in the knowledge that their economy rested on another custom , the origin of which was also lost in the mists of antiquity : the manufacture of poteen &shy; illicit whisky . <P> A 19th Century observer reported Inishmurray poteen flowing " extensively over the whole seaboard from Sligo to Bundoran and even to a considerable distance inland . " In 1893 , a detachment of Royal Irish constabulary was quartered there for revenue duty , but in later years , news of police visits usually reached King Michael in time for the great stone jugs of poteen to be hidden in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 fine or spend six months in jail for poteen-making , King Michael said : " I would have paid 10 , but they would not make it 10 , so they had to keep me for six months , which was bad business . " <P> When barley and potato prices rose during and after World War II , the poteen industry languished . In 1948 , Waters and some 60 remaining inhabitants of Inishmurray petitioned the Irish government for new land , were moved to Sligo . There King Michael , a huge figure in homespun tweeds , with a sweeping mustache , continued to hold court among those of his subjects who revisited the island every summer , ostensibly to graze cattle , but actually , it was said , to engage in their traditional industry . In Sligo last week , at the age of 80 , Michael Waters died . His eldest son Michael , known to the islanders as " Princie , " a fishery agent in County Sligo , is not likely to assume the throne . <P> Unless a new dynasty of mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inishmurray.
