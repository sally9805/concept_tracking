txt EISENHOWER CALLS FOR ' HONEST DEAL ' IN FARM BELT TALKS Says It Is Time to Cast Away Fear , ' Incompetent Fumblers , Mossbacks , Cronies , Crooks ' VISITS IOWA AND NEBRASKA 80,000 in Des Moines See General  --  His Managers Are Pleased by Political Reports Text of the Eisenhower speech is printed on page 14 . By . W.A.111103 R.ESTOPT Special to ? raoa mw wart OMAHA , Sept. ** Dwight D. Eisenhower rolled across the Missouri into Nebraska tonight quoting the Scriptures and calling for an " honest deal . " Continuing his twelve - state whistle-stop tour of the Middle West , the Republican nominee for President hit at " what is humorously called the Fair Deal " here this evening and reassured the farmers of the Plains States that they could change Administrations without kiting the economic gains of the last twenty years . His main speech of the day , however , was made in Des Moines , Iowa , where he went back to the Bible to illustrate the main Republican campaign theme that " it 's time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third chapter , sixth verse of Ecclesiastes : " A time to keep and a time to cast away . " It was time , he said on the steps of the Iowa Capitol , to cast away fear , to cast away " incompetent fumblers , Mossbacks , cronies , crooks and the disloyal in the Executive Department , the policies and philosophy of the Superstate together with all the economic wizards who are promoting that alien doctrine . " It was also time to cast away , he added , " the threat to ourpeace and our security by a stumbling foreign policy . " Audience 80,000 in Des Moines The crowds today were not as spectacular as in Minnesota or northern Illinois . on the two previous days , but the general received a rousing reception here . The Des Moines Police Commissioner estimated that 80,000 to 100,000 persons stood along the line of travel from the railroad station to the Capitol grounds , where about 30,000 gathered to hear General Eisenhower . At Davenport , Iowa , where he started today , the crowd ' ) was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Liberty , Iowa City , Marengo , Brooklyn , Grinnell , Newton , and Atlantic , all in Iowa . At each place 1,000 to 2,000 persons gathered to hear him and give him an enthusiastic reception , usually more enthusiastic before he talked than after . In Des Moines , the crowd was larger than Governor Dewey // drew in 1948. and it cheered him to the end . The nominee and his managers , on the campaign train were pleased with the response from the crowds and with reports of the political sentiment in Iowa and Nebraska . In 1948 the Republicans won Nebraska 's six electoral votes , 264 , - 774 to 224,165 . In . The general 's managers are convinced that the Iowa decision will be reversed this year , and newspaper polls seem to support that'belief . For example , The Wallace Farmer poll indicated that out of every four farmers In Iowa this year two were now definitely for General Eisenhower , one was for Gov . Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois , the Democratic Presidential nominee , and one was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters talked to every one of sixty-two voters in one Iowa precinct that went for President Truman in 1943 and found that forty-one now favored General Eisenhower and - twentyone indicated that they would vote for Governor Stevenson . Top Issues Are Found The Eisenhower managers polled this region themselves not only to get a line on the strength but to find out what p ple were most concerned about . ey found that the Korean war and corruption in Washington were the two issues uppermost in the minds of , the farmers . They discovered that in this region the voters were worried about the foreign situation because it threatened the lives of their sons and took them from the farms . General Eisenhower seemed to be addressing himself very much to these fears in his talks this morning and this afternoon . He did not undertake to define . his own policy for ending the Korean war  --  Ais managers say he will do so later ? but all across Iowa he criticized , as he now calls it , the " Democrat Administration " for " bungling " into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based upon a war economy , for using the psychology of fear in one emergency after another , and ? for lowering the moral tone of the ( national Government . I In his speeches today General Eisenhower kept very much to the over-all Republican theme that it was " time for change , " but he sought to reassure the voters that while there were many things that the Republican party , if elected in November , wanted to " cast away , " there were also many things that it wanted to keep . " You have been hearing as I have , " he said here , " that you better watch out for the Republican party because that party and its candidates are out to take something good away from the American people , Well , I know that you know better than that . I know you know more about America than that . For the implication of that assertion by the Democrats is that everything good we 've got has come to us from the generous hands and handouts of the present Administration . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inaccurate to believe that somehow a government was the source of all - bounties for the people . On the contrary , he asserted , government did not create . It merely gave what it had taken away from the people . " Where has this strange idea come from , " he continued , " that government is the great provider ? IIt comes from men who have little I faith in the people and small vision , of what the people can do . They say we must have more and laore government management of the people 's affairs , because the people are less and less able to manage their own affairs . No , that is just one totally irreconcilable difference between the Democrat party and the Republican party . The Democrat party looks down at the people ; the Republican party looks ahead with the people . " . On the question of cleaning out corrupt officials in the Federal Government , the general made this promise : " I can promise you that we wo n't wait for Congressional prodding and investigations . The prodding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are through , the experts in shady and shoddy government operations , will be on their way back to the shadowy haunts , the subcellars of American politics from whence they came . " What was needed , the general said , was a return in the conduct of our national affairs to what Theodore Roosevelt called " militant honesty . " " First , " he said , " we will restore and keep the public service at the high level of honor and distinction to which it is entitled . The first step is to call to the high offices of Government the best men and women  --  the ablest , the wisest , the most honest and reliable in the land . Those men and women will be held responsible for getting as their subordinates others who. will carry to the farthest reaches of the public service the highest and most inspiring ideals . I know something of picking top men and women for top jobs . " Next , he said , he wanted to see maintained and not . past away the constitutional relationship between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of office and his personal convictions , he said , would require that the old constitutional relationship should be maintained . The states created the Federal Government , he observed , and the creation " should not supersede the creator . " In his talks as he crossed Iowa , General Eisenhower made clear that he did not intend to seek legislation that would jeopardize the security legislation passed on behalf of farmer ; factory workers and the aged . He spoke in Omaha of " improving " present farm programs . In Iowa City , the site of the University of Iowa , he talked about a " glorious future " in which the scientific advances of the age could be transformed into human advantages for the coming generation . Everywhere he talked of restoring the full value of the dollar by attacking the inflationary tendencies in the national economy . The general was more belligerent , more critical of the Democratic Administration and more confident ' in his prepared addresses than in his extemporaneous remarks on the rear platforms of , trains . Pledges Farm Credit In Omaha tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nebraska budget and added : " On Nov. 4 , we 're going to give I the Democrats a long vacation in 1which to study these lessons . " He declared that in a Republican Iadministration farmers would get the ' " larger operating capital " the " mechanized farmer " now needs , and that this would be done through a Federal Farm Credit Board , elected by farmer members , to formulate credit policies . Reminding his Omaha audience that the Republican-controlled Eightieth Congress had made available $800,000,000 more than any other Congress for Rural Electrification Administration loans , the General emphasized that the Republicans would not cast away the economic protection given to farmers in the past . " To work for a better future for agriculture , and for America , " he said , " there must be a change in Washington . We are tired of arrogant people who have been too long in power . We are tired of roller-coaster thinking and splashy spending of other people 's money as the only solution to every problem . We are tired of outrageous taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future and build a security , a prosperity that will make our past seem puny by comparison . But we ca n't do it with a leadership that lives on past fears and that sees everything in political expediency . Farmers , like all other citizens , have had enough of what is. humorously called the Fair Deal . What we all want now , and what we are going to get , is an honest deal . " Tomorrow , the Eisenhower train will swing back to Kansas City , after a heavy speaking schedule in the key state of Missouri .
