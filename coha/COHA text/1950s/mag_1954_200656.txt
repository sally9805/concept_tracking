IT was the morning of Islam 's greatest feast day , Aid el Kebir . On that day , by sacrificing a ram . the faithful learn whether the year to come is to be peaceful and prosperous-or disastrous . <P> With pipes and drums , 5,000 Berber tribesmen , camped below the palace in the Moroccan city of Rabat , greeted the appearance of a wizened old man in a white gown whom the French a year ago made Sultan of Morocco . Sultan Sidi Mohammed ben Moulay Arafa was nervous . The last two times he had shown his face in public , he had narrowly escaped assassination by fanatic nationalist supporters of his exiled predecessor , Sultan Sidi Mohammed ben Youssef . <P> Ordinarily , the Sultan rides outside the palace walls to cut the ram 's throat. * The new Sultan prudently preferred the safety of a mosque inside the palace grounds . Carefully , he thrust his knife into the animal 's throat , then stood back while the carcass was placed on a jeep and rushed off to the palace . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace alive , the land will be blessed . A few minutes later came word from the palace : " The animal arrived still breathing . " <P> The omen was favorable . But who could depend on it ? Behind locked doors , many Moroccan nationalists celebrated the day in the name of exiled Ben Youssef . A more significant omen for Morocco 's future took place in the city of Port Lyautey . There 8.000 to 10.000 resentful Arabs , led by single-minded nationalists , had gone on a rampage in the medina ( native quarter ) the week before . They killed seven Europeans , including a woman and her daughter , whose stomachs they slit open with knives . The women 's bodies were dragged through the streets of the medina . The French last week retaliated with a brutal show of force known as ratissage , literally a " raking-in . " TIME Correspondent Frank White , an eyewitness , cabled this description : <P> THE French cut off the medina with three cordons of troops , through which no Arab could escape . Inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanks , barefoot Berber goumiers , whose hatred of the Arabs is legendary , and French police from whose wrists swung weighted truncheons . Police men , working with maps , split the medina into half a dozen sectors . Then the legionnaires , working systematically , began breaking down the doors of every house . <P> Once a door was smashed , in went the goumiers and drove out every male , except small boys . Women cried out in terror , and were beaten back with clubs or gun butts . <P> On top of a low hill in Port Lyautey 's medina is a dusty sheep market . Legionnaires drove the Arab men there and herded them under the muzzle of a Patton tank . A dozen policemen formed a gauntlet , six on either side . One by one , the Arabs were thrust forward , each with his hands on his head . <P> " Entrez done , Monsieur , " said a reserve police colonel . " The session is about to begin . " He smiled broadly , then hit a middle-aged Arab with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab went down , the colonel kneed him in the groin . The Arab tried to get up ; another cop caught him across the jaw with a club . Down went the Arab and the next cop kicked him , twice . He got up again and ran into the arms of still another policeman , who poked him into a sitting position with the muzzle of a carbine .
