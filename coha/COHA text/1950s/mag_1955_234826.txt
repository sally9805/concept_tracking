For months a battle has raged among retailers , manufacturers , discount houses and the courts over the interpretation and enforcement of Fair-Trade laws . Last week the disagreement spread to the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Justice Department 's Antitrust Division . <P> FTC touched off the dispute with Antitrust when it ruled that Eastman Kodak Co. may sign Fair-Trade contracts with independent retailers , even though these retailers compete with Kodak 's own retail stores . Nobody was more surprised at FTC 's decision than the trustbusters . Only a month ago Eastman agreed to drop Fair-Trade pricing on Kodachrome and Kodacolor film after the Justice Department brought an antitrust suit against Eastman . One of the three charges was that Eastman sold through its own retail outlets in illegal competition with price-fixed Eastman film sold through independent stores . Thus , while the Justice Department ended price fixing on two Eastman products in a consent decree ( TIME , Jan. 3 ) , FTC has sanctioned Fair-Trade pricing on Eastman 's 163 other products-cameras , lenses , photographic paper , projectors , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated the spirit of Eastman 's consent decree , would stifle competition and lead to price fixing by manufacturers . But FTC denied it was overruling the Justice Department , noted that it had specifically exempted from its decision the two Eastman products covered by the consent decree . To many a businessman , the trustbusters ' inability to agree among themselves was the best proof that the entire field of Fair-Trade pricing and enforcement needed a thorough reappraisal .
