( See Cover ) <P> On a grey , soggy Midwestern morning last week , a blue &; white Jackrabbit bus pulled up in front of the high school in Canton , S. Dak. ( pop . 2,500 ) . It was 9:30 a.m. , an early hour for a political rally even in this year of virulent campaign fever , but already 500 people were squeezed into the school auditorium . The candidate they were waiting for , a tall man who showed his 62 sedentary years but had a determined look , slipped off the bus with amazing agility . In the bus he left a bulging , battered , yellow leather briefcase with a gold-lettered name almost erased by the wear &; tear of political travel . Everyone knew the name : Robert A. Taft . <P> Bob Taft , who has campaigned harder and longer than any man who ever sought a presidential nomination , was beginning his last primary battle of 1952 . For five days after his arrival in Canton , he stormed across more than 1,000 miles of South Dakota 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made 24 speeches to 50,000 attentive South Dakotans ; almost every hall he entered was jam-full . In a flat Ohio voice he said the kind of things most Midwestern Republicans hoped to hear . He said he was against universal military training , high taxes and expensive foreign aid ; he was for farm-price supports , flood control and Douglas MacArthur . He made a big vow : " I promise you that if I am nominated and elected . . . I will reduce taxes by at least 15% within one year of the time I have been in office . " <P> Meantime , in the enemy camp , the activity was almost as furious . Eisenhower clubs had been organized in all but half a dozen of South Dakota 's 68 counties , and a first-string squad was coming in to speak for Ike . Among them were Senators Jim Duff of Pennsylvania and Fred Seaton of Nebraska , Governors Dan Thornton of Colorado , Val Peterson of Nebraska and Sherman Adams of New Hampshire , Representatives Walter Judd of Minnesota and Clifford Hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volleys after Taft left the state this week . <P> With the two candidates for the Republican nomination only a hot breath apart , South Dakota 's primary is indeed important-more important than the 14 delegates involved . The June 3 primary , in which more than 100,000 votes are expected , will be the last Eisenhower-Taft test before the Republicans gather in Chicago on July 7 . The aftertaste of South Dakota might affect the first mouth-waterings in Chicago . <P> In this final primary , Candidate Taft is on a hotter spot than Candidate Eisenhower . For here , in Taft 's Midwest heartland , Taft should win . A defeat in South Dakota would be a blow to Taft .
