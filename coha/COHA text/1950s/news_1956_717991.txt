txt A navy Aerobee-hi rocket fell far short of its attitude goal here again today . The fizzle may mean the end of the Aerobee research program . The rocket , which officials hoped would zoom to an altitude of 138 miles , spurted to only 37 miles before falling to earth in front of the eyes of disappointed technicians . Half of Expected Speed It reach ed an estimated velocity of only 3,000 feet per second against expected velocity of 6,100 feet per second . John Townsend , in charge of the naval research laboratory 's rocket sonde ( exploration of outer atmosphere bra n c h , said indications were that the failure was in the thrust chamber . Scientists said the program certainly will be delayed until the cause of the failures can he determined and corrected . The delay , they indi c a te d , m ; ght be so long as to virtually remove the Aerobee-hi , a navy developed research vehicle , from the program of the international geophysical year starting in 1957 . Aimed at Two Studies One purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study radiation which does not reach the earth 's surface . Naval scientists are also studying solar flare , the mysterious , terrific explosions which surge from the sun with power many times as powerful as atomic bombs . A highly publicized shooting of the Aerobee-hi for a new altitude record in the southern New Mexico desert several weeks ago fizzled when the rocket turned back to the earth latter reaching only a few thousand feet .
