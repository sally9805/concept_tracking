The delegates to the U.N . General Assembly were all eager to get home for the holidays , but they could not end their tenth-anniversary session until they could agree on which small nation should get the eleventh seat on the Security Council . They had disagreed for 35 ballots , an alltime U.N . record . <P> The antagonists were the Philippines and Yugoslavia ; the issue geography and precedent . The British Commonwealth countries , West Europeans and the Soviet bloc insisted on Yugoslavia 's election to the Security Council seat that has been reserved since a " gentlemen 's agreement " in London ten years ago as the " East European " seat on the Council . The U.S. , arguing that the agreement has run out and that Asia 's growing importance entitles it to a Council seat , was joined by almost all of the Latin Americans and many Asian members in supporting the Philippines . <P> Neither side would give ground . At last . Assembly President Jos Maza of Chile proposed a novel solution-Yugoslavia and the Philippines could agree to split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits the first year . At a private meeting in Maza 's office . Yugoslavia won the draw . Then , however , the Assembly balked at Maza 's recourse to " lottery ' ' and insisted on more balloting . More balloting brought more deadlock , and finally Yugoslavia agreed , if elected , to resign from the Council after one year in the Philippines ' favor . With that understanding , the delegates elected the Yugoslavs by a decisive 43 out of 70 votes . That done , delegates stood up for a traditional minute of silent " prayer or meditation " and then , to the bang of Senor Maza 's gavel , scurried home . It had been a contentious , tiring 13 weeks for all . and particularly for Assembly President Maza , who was also besieged by an increasing round of diplomatic teas , dinners and cocktail parties . " You have to drink the same Scotch or the same Manhattans , " he complained , " and eat the same shrimps and talk to the selfsame people . It is somewhat tiring . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
