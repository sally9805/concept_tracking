Dear TIME-Reader : <P> <P> " THE highest tribute any story can get is close scrutiny and high praise by the experts concerned . Last week the Air Force was going all out for our text and color picture spread ( TIME , March 5 ) on the nation 's youngest military service . It sent copies of the magazine to 660 Information Service officers at U.S. bases around the world . At the Air Force Academy Brigadier General Robert M. Stillman , cadet commandant , ordered copies for each of the 265 cadets . TIME 'S story will be used in the Airmanship Division of Cadet Studies and may be incorporated into academy textbooks . Said General Stillman : " TIME writers and photographers are to be congratulated for an excellent story ... a detailed and comprehensive study . . . " <P> <P> IN a corner of the National Affairs bullpen is the most prized copy boy station in our editorial department . It is furnished with a comfortable chair , phone , water cooler , a typewriter and plenty of copy paper . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privacy of this corner , a succession of young men have daydreamed , read , studied college textbooks or pecked hopefully at the typewriter between errands for the editor , the writers and the researchers in the N.A. section . <P> One of these was Thomas Anderson , whose first novel , Your Own Beloved <P> Sons , is reviewed in this issue ( see BOOKS ) . Tom occupied the corner for a year . By day the copy boy buzzer was a continual interruption , but late at night , when the big bullpen was dark except for the ceiling reflections of nearby Broadway 's neons , he sat under a desk lamp , pipe-smoking and writing . Fifteen times Tom rewrote his book . Late in the summer of 1954 he quit TIME and went off to the cranberry boglands of New Jersey 's Toms River country to live alone in a shack and polish the final version of his Korean war story . <P> Tom 's immediate predecessor in the corner was Leslie Stevens , who spent much of his two years there writing plays . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit that paved the way for a Broadway production of his Champagne Complex . Now Stevens has another play , The Lovers , in rehearsal . Good friends , the two former TIME copy boys have been collaborating on an adaptation of Ibsen 's The Master Builder , with Stevens doing the writing and Anderson the translating . <P> Last week Tom Anderson revisited his old corner and presented National Affairs Editor Max Ways with a copy of his novel . Said Tom : " I think you ought to have one of these , Mr. Ways - I wrote so much of it on your time . " <P> Cordially yours ,
