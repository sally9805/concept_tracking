LAURETTE ( 433 pp. ) - Marguerite Courtney-Rinehart ( $5 ) . <P> On Easter eve 1945 , a sick but triumphant actress stepped into her dressing room in Manhattan 's Playhouse theater . This opening night of The Glass Menagerie had proved what many critics and theatergoers had long believed : that Laurette Taylor was one of America 's great actresses . Among the flowers and the telegrams stood a bottle of Scotch , the gift of testy Critic George Jean Nathan . It was a special kind of a tribute , and Laurette understood . She wired : " Thanks for the vote of confidence . " <P> For almost 20 years Laurette Taylor had been a desperate alcoholic . When she was suggested to young Playwright Tennessee Williams for The Glass Menagerie , he replied that he thought she was dead . And so in a way she had been . It is to her daughter 's uncommon credit that she has not tried to pretty up Laurette 's life in a biography that shows the pain of writing on most of its pages . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from most current books about theater greats . Ethel Barrymore 's Memories and Gertrude Lawrence as Mrs. A. are never far from casual entertainment . Laurette re-enacts a drama that had more than its quota of despair . <P> She was born in New York in 1884 to a whisky-loving Irish saddlemaker who thought all theater people damned and his dressmaker wife , who had often dreamed of being an actress herself . James Cooney 's answer to his daughter 's games of make-believe was to whip her . His wife Elizabeth sent her to a dancing and singing teacher and sneaked with her to shows at the Harlem Opera House . She got Laurette her first stage job when she was 13 , married her off to Charles Taylor , a successful writer of corny melodrama , when she was 16 . After ten years Laurette divorced him , but not before she had played his bad scripts hundreds of times , been broke in scores of touring towns , and borne him two children ( one , Marguerite , is the author of this book ) . <P> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used herself up on plays written by her husbands . When she married the popular but lightweight British Playwright J. Hartley Manners , it was both a real love match and a tacit contract to become his star for life . Together they became rich and famous ( Peg 0 ' My Heart , One Night in Rome ) , but it was plain that a great talent was being spent on thin theater . Laurette did not seem much to care . Peg 0 ' My Heart had made her a favorite of New York and London ; the movie made her a household heroine to the nation . Hollywood also introduced her to Movie Idol John Gilbert , a passionate love affair , and the beginning of discontent with her husband and with her life . <P> Trouble with God . During the heady years of success , Laurette was as selfish as she was gay . For her , people were sharply divided into two groups , the talented and the " others . " To the others she could be cruelly and unnecessarily cutting . Her children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to prove them exceptional . Of real affection she was sadly short . <P> Laurette had begun to drink and went into such rages that her daughter barricaded her door at night . From Laurette 's room would come noises , " sounds which seemed to come from hell and under . "
