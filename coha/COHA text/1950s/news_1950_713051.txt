txt Letters to The Times Defending Western World German Participation Proposed in Plans to Halt Communism ro THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMER : Conventional opinion regards rather optimistically the situation of the democratic world in a potential world war . Victory for the democracies , it asserts , would be based on population , production capacity and the resources of the West , which still outstrip the Communists . In all these predictions the existing line of division is taken as the base of comparison , and Western Europe given high importance . But this view has some great shortcomings . It is too materialistic . Material alone would be useless in the hands of a nation unwilling to fight for its existence . The Communists in Russia were a pitiful underground movement in a restricted circle , yet they seized control of the vastest country in the world , expanding its power in an unparalleled short time . The same dynamic forces still head that movement , led by the same fanatic men . Furthermore , Western Europe can be seized in a quick onrush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of the seizure of Europe would be formidable . The Western World would be deprived of great human and material resources which would be turned against the Western World . Then , in its life-anddeath struggle communism would mercilessly eradicate all forces of Western Europe whose loyalty was at all suspect . Russia would then gain excellent advanced positions to combat America and to give Great Britain staggering blows . Quick advance of Communist troops would unloose in the Communist world a great enthusiasm and raise its fighting power . The United States would be forced to wage war almost alone . What would be the price of American victory and the consequences ? The precondition of Western European victory over communism is to prevent Europe from being occupied by communism . Only after wavering has the democratic world begun to ponder how to protect Europe from this danger . However , the plans are quite inadequate to achieve this aim . The purpose of the Atlantic Pact is to fulfill this task . For geographic and other conditions France must present the main core of the land army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the arsenal of the free world , assume strategic bombing and , together with Great Britain , the protection of the sea lanes . But this paper plan is doomed to collapse . It is an error to think that the French would be able to render any resistance ? to Communist onslaught . The Communist steamroller would quickly remove all hindrances on the way to the Atlantic coast and reach it long before the United States could come to the rescue . Thus the United States would be forced to mobilize many millions of her ablest men , eliminating them from arms production , thus damaging her technical supremacy . It is high time to recognize that the unconditional destruction of Germany and Japan at the borders of dynamic Russia was a mistake of the first magnitude . Now the United States is forced to stand almost alone face to face with the Communist danger and fill the gap brought about- with the destruction of these two powerful essential barriers to Communist aggression . It is safe to say that the German people would be strong enough to resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marshal its forces and reach the European Continent . Inaction of West The Western World is still trying to find a modus vivendi with communism and is doing almost nothing in Germany , while Russia is militarizing the Eastern zone to forge an instrument with which to conquer Western Germany , as in Korea . Thus the Western World is giving up the essential part of Germany , abandoning it to Russia . The Western World should remember that Germany will be forced to fight on the side of Russia if she can not be protected against communism . Giving France the essential role in the defense of Europe clearly points to the abandonment of Germany to communism in the event of World War III . Germany as well as , Western Europe can not be defended without Germany 's participation . But if Western Germany were to be invited to take part in the defense of Europe , it must be done without imposing conditions that would nullify her part . Germany can not fight if her army is deprived of heavy weapons or if she can not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her army is scattered in the army of the Western World . The point is not whether or not we like Germany . The free world ' can be saved only if it is able to undertake an abrupt turn from the past . There is not much time left . LEONHARD VAHTER , Former Member of the Estonian Parliament . Brooklyn , July 5 , 1950 . Program of Released Time To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORIC TIMEe : In the " News of the Week in Review " of June 25 , under the heading " Court Upholds Released Time Here , " Murray Illson gives a report on Judge Anthony J. Di Giovanna 's ruling in the matter of released time for religious instruction in the New York City public schools . In dismissing the petition of two Brooklyn parents , Judge Di Giovanna listed seven points upholding his opinion , which favors the continuance of this program . AS a recently retired teacher of many years ' experience in New York schools this writer , venturing an opinion from the teacher 's point of view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although it is true that there is no actual element of religious segregation when certain pupils leave their classes each week at an assigned time , the feeling of a division into religious groups is patent . Everyone in the class is aware of it , pupil as well as teacher ( subtle though it may be ) . In point seven the judge says , " Pupils who do not attend religious classes continue ' significant educational work ' in their classrooms . " A question arises in the mind of every honest teacher who has experienced this situation . Just what is meant by the phrase " significant educational work " ? With a segment of the class , often a very considerable number , missing  --  there is an immediate letdown in the attentiveness of those remaining . Subconsciously there is resentment that they must continue school work while their classmates have been excused . Their minds are not mature enough to grasp the meaning of " released time . " To those left in the classroom it simply means that they have been deprived of an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hardly the atmosphere in which to accomplish " significant educational work . " ANNA P New York , June 27 , 1950 . Lattimore Stand Queried Statements on North and South Korea Not Considered Proved To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Arthur Krock 's acceptance in his column on July 11 of certain quoted statements of Owen Lattimore as being of " proved authority " seems , quite beyond the mark . The " approved " statements are too long to quote in full . It is enough to say that they referred to the North Koreans as having land of their own to defend ( sic ) , and a new Government " based on protection of their rights " ( . ! ) , while the South Korean Government consisted mainly of pro-Japanese corruptionists , untrustworthy officials and undependable soldiers . Lattimore 's conclusion was that " if there is to be a civil war * * * North Korea would be able to overrun South Korea without Russian help * * * . " One can only hope that neither Mr. Krock nor THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for if true they would seriously undermine our moral and legal standing in Korea . In fact , they are merely a rehash of the ill-omened comparisons drawn years ago by Lattimore and his fellow-thinkers between the " agrarian reformers " in China and the wicked Nationalists . The only " proved " statements in the long quotation would seem to be that the North Korean Army was equipped with Russian material , and that the Americans organized only a " constabulary " in South Korea . But Lattimore , as quoted , failed to note that the trouble was not with the personnel of this constabulary , but with American refusal to equip it for modern battle . Criticism of the South Korean soldiers in an American newspaper seems particularly ungracious when it was the American Government 's own deliberate policy which exposed them practically barehanded to the Russian tanks and heavy artillery . The sad initial experience of our own brave soldiers in Korea should remind us that naked courage alone can not ward off wellarmed invasion . WATSON WASHBURN . New York , July 11 , 1950 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE NEW YORK TIMES : I wish to point up some truths that now must be evident to everyone . One is that , island or continent , a navy with large , fast , hard-hitting carrier task forces is necessary for victory . The same techniques used in the last war to reduce island fortresses in the Pacific can be used successfully against the large Korean peninsula . While the Army is fighting a holding action on the southern front carrier-based planes by tactical bombing can clear the way for amphibious operations . Divisions of men , tanks and guns can thus be landed between the invading forces and their bases of supply . Then , strategic bombing by ** will be effective in knocking out factorieT , railroads and blasting truck routes out of existence . Of course , the situation may become so bad that amphibious landings would be our only recourse . If the war in the Pacific carried any lesson for the military man it is this : The carrier task force similar to Task Force 58 , not the atom bomb , has revolutionized modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific for which we contested as a continent , the islands where we landed as seaports . That is the pattern of victory . PAUL E. EDERHEIMER . New YorH , July 11 , 1950 . Government 's Health Efforts To THE EDITOR OF TELE ! NEW YORK TIMES : Dr. LaRochelle states in a letter to THE NEW YORK TIMES that the American Medical Association is justified in spending millions of dollars to fight our Government 's efforts to further the health of America . The " taxpayers ' money " being spent to " propagandize " the point of view of Washington was appropriated by the representatives of the American people , while the policies of Mr. Truman have been approved in a free national election by the majority of Americans . It is not uncommon for privileged groups to overlook in their arguments the fact that our Government is one based on majority rule . Those who disagree can seek to become a majority in the future , but they can hardly expeat Washington to cease to " propagandize " policies aproved by the elec. torate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950.
