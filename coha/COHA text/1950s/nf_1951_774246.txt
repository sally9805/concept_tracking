txt  | considered as the cause of warmth , we do not perceive its presence ; it is concealed or latent , and I give it the name of Latent Heat " . l Since among his " friends " who are known to have carried out experiments on the same lines was James Watt , it is not too much to say that the whole course of modern civilisation was being determined for better or for worse when Black first put his " cylindrical tin-plate vessels " " upon a red-hot kitchen table " . We have not space here to review the whole history of the steam engine , but of the close interplay between " pure " science and its application to the arts , this famous case provides a lesson too valuable to be lightly passed over . There is no indication in Black 's writings that his interest in specific and latent heats was prompted by any ulterior motive save that of a deeper understanding of natural processes . On the other hand it is perfectly clear that Watt 's interest in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of heat " wasted " in warming up the cylinder of the steam engine and the proportion of the heat " stored " in steam which was available for driving the piston . On the famous " Sabbath afternoon " when Watt first directed his thought to the improvement of the steam engine , the latter had been in regular use for three-quarters of a century . Most of these were of the form designed by Newcomen , a form itself an improvement of the earlier one invented by his master , Thomas Savery . In the Newcomen engine it was the atmosphere which did all the pushing , steam being used merely to reduce the pressure by sweeping out the air after which it was rapidly condensed by means of water jets . Watt , being set by Glasgow University to repair their engine , quickly realised how extremely inefficient such a contrivance was which had to use a great proportion of each charge of steam in re-heating the cylinder chilled by the condensing jets ; hence at first his interest in the specific heat of cylinder metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his fertile mind continued its analysis with the result that in 1769 he filed a petition for letters-patent in the following terms : Footnote  | " My method of lessening the consumption of steam , and consequently of fuel , in fire-engines , consists of the following principles : First , that vessel in which the powers of steam are to be employed to work the engine . . . must , during the whole time the engine is at work , be kept as hot as the steam that enters it ; first , by enclosing it in a case of wood or any other materials that transmit heat slowly ; secondly , by surrounding it with steam or other heated bodies . Second , in engines that are to be worked wholly or partially by condensation of steam , the steam is to be condensed in vessels distant from the steam vessels or cylinders . Thirdly , whatever air or other elastic vapour is not condensed by the cold of the condenser and may impede the working of the engine is to be drawn out of the steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world of progress is here enshrined ! At a time when " phlogiston " and " airs " still reigned supreme we have a mind analysing a machine in terms of precise scientific concepts ? conduction of heat , conservation of heat , pressure of air and of vapour . Here indeed is an example of what Whitehead reminds us was the cause of the transformation of European civilisation during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries : not merely the making of inventions , but the discovery of the technique of making inventions . Other patents followed in rapid succession : Watt was a master at improving his own improvements . But in our homage to Watt we must not forget the debt that is due to Black , Roebuck , and Matthew Boulton , who successively backed him with larger and larger sums of money , without which his engine would never have passed beyond the laboratory . To Boulton in particular does the world owe a large part of whatever advantage it has gained from the steam engine . This Birmingham ironmaster was one of the first " captains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and versatility with moral courage . He knew that to ensure the permanent adoption of steam power it was necessary to accept low profits ? mostly on a royalty basis , so much being paid each year by the purchaser in proportion to the amount saved by the new engine ? and high risk ; so while Watt was whining that his invention brought him nothing but sorrow , Boulton was risking his all in the determination to hold the public interest . At first their steam engine was used only for pumping , as Newcomen 's had been , but Watt 's invention of the " sun and planet " gear , whereby to-and-fro  | motion of the piston was converted into rotary motion for spinning and grinding , was at once recognised by Boulton as the herald of a new age . Its consequences to social life have been incalculable ; for it not only accelerated the disappearance of hand spinning and weaving ( the former started by Arkwright 's invention of the roller spinning frame worked by water power ) but also removed the necessity for mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upheaval was less than it might have been , as the Pennine Hills , whose streams had determined the situation of the first factories , were little distant from the chief outcrops of the coal measures . But the increase in production may be judged from the fact that the number of power looms ( Cartwright 1785 , first used in a factory after its improvement by Radcliffe and by Horrocks in 1803 ) rose from 2,400 in 1813 to ioo , 000 in 1833 . We have not space to detail all the improvements Watt effected before he gave up business in 1800 , but it must be emphasised that the steam engine as he left it was a machine for employing the pressure of steam and also its power of expansion . Both these powers depend on the heat properties of steam , so it is not surprising that in the early years of the nineteenth century the study of heat claimed the interest of many men of science . Chief among these was perhaps the French mathematician , Fourier , whose study of the laws of heat-flow are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of applied mathematics . With few exceptions all these workers were content to regard heat as a weightless fluid . And most remarkable of all , the study upon which the whole of the modern theory of heat engines ? and of much else besides ? is based , a little pamphlet written by an obscure young French engineer , Sadi Carnot , was conceived entirely in terms of " caloric " . Indeed Carnot went so far as to say that " we may with propriety compare the motive power of heat with that of a water fall " ( but see p. 279 ) . It is abundantly clear then that this " false " hypothesis was entirely adequate to the establishment of the science of heat on a firm basis . Evidence was not wanting that such a view needed drastic alteration to be adequate to the whole problem of the behaviour of heat ; but half a century was to pass before the wide acceptance of this  | more abstract point of view became necessary if further progress were not to be hampered . How this came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not close our account of the Revolution Chimique without taking a glance at the Revolution Physiologique which was one of its consequences . One of the strongest claims of the phlogiston hypothesis to the regard of contemporary men of science was its generality . The rapidity with which the " oxygen hypothesis " displaced its well-entrenched rival was due in no small measure to the wide sweep of Lavoisier 's speculative genius , as a result of which the new hypothesis was at once brought to bear on every problem to which the older had applied . By means of accurate experiments carried out on devoted assistants , Lavoisier satisfied himself that respiration consists in the slow oxidation of the material of which the organism 's body is composed . To this end he developed the method of quantitative analysis still in use for the estimation of the proportions of the elements carbon and hydrogen in organic compounds , that is , by the conversion of these elements into their respective oxides , which are weighed after absorption in suitable chemicals . Moreover , profiting by the discoveries of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this matter " he proceeded with the aid of the great mathematical physicist , Laplace , to compare the actual quantities of heat disengaged by the combustion of a candle with the quantity of heat given off by a cock kept quiet for some hours . The heat was measured in these and other experiments by the quantity of ice melted in an insulated vessel devised by Laplace . ' They were satisfied that to a large extent " animal heat " can be accounted for merely by the oxidation of carbon compounds contained in the blood . In raising these questions Lavoisier realised that he was venturing into deep waters , which he made no claim to have plumbed ; but the methods he introduced ? those of exact measurement and comparison with similar events in the non-living world ? are those by which physiology has ever since advanced . Deduction from measurements presupposes the conservation through-Footnote  | out the action of the materials studied ; this was fully appreciated by Lavoisier . " Nothing is created " , he wrote , " either in the operation of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to ponder on the problem first raised by Lucretius in the immortal words : " Nature never suffers anything to be born until she has recruited herself by the death of some other . " " Plants " , in the words of Lavoisier , " take up air and water and mineral matter necessary for their organisation . Animals feed on plants or on other animals themselves nourished by vegetables . Ultimately fermentation , putrefaction , and combustion return to the air and the mineral kingdom the principles borrowed from them by plants and animals . " By what processes does nature carry out this marvellous circulation between the three kingdoms ? How does she form combustible , fermentable , and putrescible substances from materials having none of these properties ? These are impenetrable mysteries . " To him , alas , they were impenetrable ; for an ignorant and savage bunch of upstarts robbed the world of this fine spirit a few years later . But his work had paved the way so well that by 1804 de Saussure had begun the process of penetration . Using Lavoisier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vessel in which a green plant was growing only when carbon dioxide was present in the first instance . By the close of the century the phlogiston hypothesis had died out . Priestley alone , writing from his comfortable exile in America ( 1796 ) was left to die rather cantankerously in the last ditch ; but such was his influence that the leading chemist of the New World , John Maclean , had to warn his students against his ill-considered arguments . Maclean 's lectures ( 1797 ) are a testimony to the completeness and swiftness of the Revolution Chimique , and to the speed of communication between the continents . Meanwhile , on 8th May 1794 , the other revolution had terminated one of the most illustrious of human lives . On the following day the mathematician , Lagrange , sorrowfully remarked " Only a moment was needed to cause that head to fall , and a hundred years perhaps will not suffice to raise another like it . " Posterity has fully confirmed these words .  | Footnote  | THE " SUBTLE FLUIDS " ? II . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " burning question " had been settled and modern chemistry thus established , had been made possible by the manipulation of limited volumes of invisible substances within confined spaces in which chemical action could be induced by the intense heat of electric sparks . The foundation of chemistry , then , had undoubtedly been assisted by the invention of machines capable of producing considerable quantities of electricity ; but for the further development of this branch of science , particularly in the isolation of new elements from common materials such as chalk and soda , a further advance in the production of electricity was absolutely indispensable . This advance had , in fact , been made before Lavoisier 's death , and its importance quickly realised and put to good use . In pursuance of our purpose to show how the growth of science resembles that of a healthy plant , in which the maturity of one organ can be achieved only by the corresponding development of another , we shall now try to trace the main line of progress in the study of what is perhaps the most wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ways of magnets are easily confused with those of electrified bodies it will be convenient to deal with them together . Although knowledge of the properties of the lodestone ? the natural magnetic ore of iron ? and of rubbed amber can be traced back in both Greece and China many centuries before the Christian era , it was not till 1269 that a clearly reasoned account of the properties of the magnet is anywhere to be found ; and it is only after the lapse of more than three centuries that the knowledge of electrified bodies was submitted to a critical survey . As is so often the case in the history of science the application of  | a singular property preceded its thorough understanding . Thus there is no doubt that the art of navigation was receiving its greatest stimulus for several centuries before 1269 . Who first distinguished the power of a magnet to set in a given direction from the more familiar property of attracting pieces of iron is a question which the indefatigable labours of many scholars have been unable to answer . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which always pointed in a direction nearly due south ; but though these carriages were said to be in existence from very early times , the earliest written record is dated later than the famous allusion in the book De Utensilibus of the English monk , Alexander Neckam , who lived in the twelfth century . The method of using the magnet as described in this book was very different from that of to-day ; but it is perfectly clear that it had by that time been introduced as a subsidiary aid to navigation when the stars were obscured by cloud . It is seldom that we can point to a particular event as marking the birth of a branch of science , but in no case can we more justly do so than to the letter written by Pierre de Maricourt ( Petrus Peregrinus ) on 12th August I269 to his " nearest of friends " , Sigerius of Foucaucourt . Manuscript copies of this letter were made at the time , but its contents do not appear to have been known outside a narrow monastic circle until after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not primarily the improvement of the mariner 's compass . Bored , it seems , by the futility of trench warfare before the city of Lucera , he turned his mind to the quite unscientific problem of constructing an engine capable of perpetual motion . The power of the lodestone seemed to him to be the most likely means of encompassing this end . This wild-cat scheme was characteristic of an unscientific age ; but the exhaustive study of the properties of the lodestone as a means to this end was such as to give the writer an almost unique position ( recognised by his contemporary , Roger Bacon ) in the history of science . When de Maricourt started to make his investigations he probably knew that the lodestone ( 1 ) attracts iron ; ( 2 ) sets in a  | definite direction ; and ( 3 ) imparts its power of attraction to previously unmagnetised iron . By carefully contrived experiments he ( 1 ) proved the existence of definite " poles " , giving several methods of locating them ? one of which virtually implies the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2 ) discovered , and formally stated as a law , the fact that unlike poles attract one another ; ( 3 ) showed that new poles are created every time that a magnet is broken , and disappear when the fragments are once more joined ; ( 4 ) that an existing pole may be reversed in polarity by bringing up to it a sufficiently strong opposite pole . Though he naturally failed in his original purpose , yet it is to his credit that he realised that in the use of magnetic fields lay the possibility of continuous motion ( now effected in the electric motor by continuously altering the position of one of the fields ) . Moreover by incorporating a fixed scale and a pivoted needle , he much improved the usefulness of the mariner 's compass . All this was achieved in 1269 . But little use seems to have been made of it for the next two hundred years . In the first half of the fifteenth century however the Italian city states of Genoa and Venice were bringing to the notice of Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great as was this commercial revolution it was soon recognised that the long overland caravan routes and frequent trans-shipments raised the cost of the goods beyond the reach of any but the very wealthy . What was needed was circumnavigation of Africa in the south , or the blazing of a new trail to the Indies by going round the world by the west ; for despite the landsmen 's belief most mariners were convinced that the world was a sphere . It was largely owing to the improvement of the compass by the Portuguese Prince Henry the Navigator that these two objects were both achieved . Moreover on his third voyage to the West Indies , Columbus discovered the highly important fact that the compass points along a line whose inclination to the true meridian varies at different points on the earth 's surface . In 1576 Robert Norman found that if a needle is balanced before being rubbed by the lodestone it always points downwards at a definite angle after magnetisation . Norman was an instrument maker ; so once again it was the " practical "  | man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth 's magnetic field . During the sixteenth century many more discoveries were made concerning the workings of magnets , and the Italian , Cardan , recalled men 's minds to the similar but , as he showed , quite distinct attractive force of rubbed amber . In the first year of the new century however appeared one of the most famous books in the history of science ; this was De Magnete , Magneticisgue Corporibus , et de Magno Magnete Tellure , by William Gilbert , a native of Colchester , and physician to Queen Elizabeth . This work is famous not only because it may be said to have founded the science of magnetism , but because it shares with the writings of Galileo and Harvey the claim to be a model of the " new " scientific method of discovery and explanation . The form and content of Gilbert 's book stand out like a watershed in the country of the mind . Reading it from one point of view we can not help being impatient with the pseudo-Aristotelian atmosphere of the whole work . The author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to his own studies with a determination to see in the facts of terrestrial magnetism a further extension of the great Greek 's system of nature . But when we turn away from the frame in which Gilbert 's observations are set to the observations themselves , we find that the Renaissance preoccupation with signs and wonders has completely disappeared . The compass is no longer magically controlled by the pole star but by the " great magnet the earth " , and this is no mere speculation , but a conclusion arrived at from the careful correlation of observations on the behaviour of tiny pivoted magnets moved over the surface of a spherical . This complex work of an original genius who , it may be inferred , remains something of an historical curiosity , can not be profitably studied except with a detailed examination for which we have no space . Nevertheless we must mention one more of his discoveries , since it constitutes the foundation of the science of electricity . Though Cardan had recognised that the attractive force of rubbed amber was different in kind from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected that this power , or " soul " , as it had been called from the time of Plato or even earlier , resided anywhere in nature except in this rather unusual material in which not only a " soul " but also the bodies of flies are not infrequently found entrapped . Driven on by one of his Aristotelian fancies Gilbert sought to discover whether the " soul " really was peculiar to amber ; and in a famous passage he enumerates more than twenty different substances which on vigorous rubbing acquire similar properties to that of amber . The attractive force then is nothing to do with amber , but is an " effluvium " widely dispersed and capable of being generated by friction . This he proved by means of a delicately mounted needle ? the first electroscope , though he called it a " versorium " . Despite , as we know now , the unsuitable conditions in which Gilbert worked , he found , apart from metals , comparatively few " non-electrics " ? the name he gave to those substances which , after repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versorium " . For nearly two centuries after the appearance of De Magnete , progress in the study of magnetism was almost entirely confined to the preparation of maps of the earth 's magnetic field , and to the correction of the errors of Gilbert and others , which a careful study of these maps brought to light . But before the end of the seventeenth century scattered experiments by Boyle , Newton , and especially von Guericke , had revealed the far greater variety of the effects of the " electric effluvium " , the study of which consequently attracted a growing number of investigators . An adequate study of the progress of our knowledge of electricity during the eighteenth century would demand a volume to itself ; we can as usual do no more than follow what seems to be the main line of advance , bearing in mind that the labours of many men here unnamed contributed much that was of great assistance to that advance . In 1709 , Hauksbee published an account of many varied experiments by which he had established the fact that threads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a charged body , and this will occur even if they are placed within an uncharged hollow sphere . A few years later Stephen Gray showed  | that the electrical influences could be transmitted along hundreds of yards of pack thread when this was suspended by silk , but not at all when brass suspensions were used ; thus conductors and insulators were distinguished . In these experiments Gray was aided by his friends Godfrey and Wheler ; but the demonstration which had the greatest popular appeal was that in which one of his pupils of the Grey Friars School ( Charterhouse ) was hung from the rafters by silk threads . After his feet had been touched with a glass tube , charged by rubbing , the boy 's face at once attracted feathers in such a manner as only an electrically charged body can do : the human body then is able to conduct electricity . In later experiments with suspended threads Gray showed that a charged thread can induce a charge in a neighbouring thread as much as a foot distant from it . By his failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognised that the charge lies wholly on the surface . Gray died in 1736 . His own observations , taken with those of Hauksbee and von Guericke , comprise almost the whole of the fundamental properties of stationary ( " static " ) electric charges ; but as yet no general hypothesis had been put forward to correlate them . This was done by a brilliant young Frenchman , Charles Dufay who , having in 1733 read the papers Gray had published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society , repeated the experiments and within three years ? his last memoir was dated 1737 ? had established a science of electricity out of what had before been disconnected , if ingeniously contrived , observations . His first contribution was to enlarge Gilbert 's list of " electrics " to include all rigid substances other than metals . But it was not long before he realised the implication of Gray 's silk fibres and resin blocks . Having added glass to the list of insulators he succeeded in showing that metals insulated by glass handles are electrified more readily than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has little to do with the material being rubbed , but only with the nature of its connexion ? insulating or conducting ? with the earth . This cardinal discovery was expressed by him in the words : " Electricity is a quality universally expanded in all the matter we know , and which influences the mechanism of the universe far more  | than we think " ? a prophecy far more pregnant than he could possibly even have guessed at . Next Dufay explained the fact first observed by von Guericke , namely that once a body has touched a charged body it is no longer attracted but repelled by the latter . Electricity , he thought , repells itself ; for if one of the charged bodies loses its charge by contact with the earth it is once again attracted by the charged body . Then came one of those " accidental discoveries " which have changed the history of science . Up to this time the " electric effluvium " was sharply distinguished from the magnetic in having no essential duality such as that which the invariable creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , wishing to study the effect of two charged bodies on a gold leaf charged by rubbed glass , he by chance brought near to it a piece of rubbed gum copal . He was " prodigiously disconcerted " to see that whereas the glass , as was usual , repelled the gold leaf , the copal attracted it . To a man of Dufay 's temper an experiment which did n't work was a challenge . Repeated trials with other pieces of glass and other pieces of gum or amber gave always the same result ? the reaction with glass was opposite to that with resins ; which led him to " conclude that there are perhaps two kinds of electricities " , thereafter named " vitreous " and " resinous " . To discover the relationship between the two " electricities " ? whether they were , for instance , mutually connected as in the case of magnetic poles ? was not possible without more refined means of measurement . Such instruments are all based on the mutual repulsion of charged bodies first recorded by Hauksbee . Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to have described such an instrument ; but the first form in which it attained almost universal use was that devised by John Canton in 1754 , in which the intensity of the charge was estimated by the degree of divergence between two threads each carrying a ball of elder pith . From this time onwards improvements of one kind and another were rapidly introduced by Henly , Cavallo , Volta , and Bennet . Of these investigators Volta stands supreme by his recognition of the necessity of introducing an electrical " yard stick " so that investigators in different countries  | could compare results though using different instruments . He replaced the pith balls by two straws and then calibrated his instrument by actually " weighing " the attraction of two charged plates which gave a convenient angular deflection between the straws . Bennet 's contribution was to substitute gold leaves for straws . The first description of this instrument was sent by Bennet from his church at Wirksworth in Derbyshire to Priestley in 1786 ; this simple contrivance has made possible such modern marvels as the mapping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X-rays and of the analysis of radiations from radioactive substances . The invention of the electroscope had enabled Canton to  | prove the true nature of induction , namely that the approximation of a charged to an uncharged body causes a charge of the opposite kind of electricity to appear on the side of the latter near to the inducing charge , while at the remote side there appears an equal charge of the same kind as the inducing charge . It is thus quite clear why on the removal of the inducing charge the second body is found to be once again uncharged ? the opposite charges have " run together " into electric neutrality . Perhaps the critical reader is ready to suggest an alternative and , in some ways , simpler hypothesis . Whether this be so or not , Benjamin Franklin from 1747 onwards communicated in a series of letters to his friend and London agent , Peter Collinson , an account of experiments carried out by himself and others in Philadelphia , leading to such an hypothesis which rapidly gained ground throughout the whole of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do that the course of scientific discovery is at least to some extent a matter of chance . It is very probable that Franklin and his little band of associates came to the study of electricity unprejudiced by the confused mass of speculations which had arisen in Europe as a consequence of the widespread activity in this branch of science . All that the colonists had to go upon was the hypothesis of William Watson which had been put forward on the basis of a number of experiments carried out with the " Leyden jar " newly invented by Musschenbroek in 1746 . This was at first a glass vessel containing water into which a wire from an electric machine was dipped and which could be charged continuously by the operation of the machine . When the operator touched the wire he received a much severer shock than the machine alone could give , and if he at the same time held the jar in his hand the severity was still further increased . Moreover both these effects occurred even after the jar had been disconnected from the machine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condenser " , a fuller account of which will be given later . Watson 's hypothesis was that all substances are surrounded and to some extent penetrated by an " elastic electric ether " , which is " disturbed " in a charged body so that a portion of the  | universal " ether " runs from the nearest conductor ( e.g. a man holding a charged Leyden jar ) into the " disturbed " region and an equal amount runs from the earth into the body which has lost its own . The hypothesis was short-lived ; but it is important historically , because it was in an attempt to render it more adequate to all the facts that Franklin put forward his own more famous one . Not only was Franklin ill-versed ( perhaps fortunately ) in the current hypotheses , but he seems to have had no acquaintance with the electroscope . In any case his own method of estimating the relative strengths of charges was by comparing the sparks which they could produce . Now a large body may receive a charge without thereafter yielding a spark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a manner never before attempted , the fact that if a sharp point be held near a charged conductor , the latter produces a spark much more readily . Franklin 's innovation lay in his proof that a charged body can be completely discharged by the mere approach of a pointed conductor held in the hand or otherwise connected to earth . While the European enthusiasts were vieing with each other in the production of bigger and better shocks and longer and longer chains of victims joined hand to hand to receive them , Franklin was applying his genius to the elaboration of the simple but adequate hypothesis which has sufficed , at least for the practical electrician , ever since . The discharge of a charged body by the mere approach of a pointed , earthed conductor at once suggested to Franklin the analogy of a pipe opening into a cistern of water . Just as all the water in tanks and cisterns in the end finds its way back to the sea , so the earth constitutes the main reservoir of the " common stock " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a body with " vitreous " electricity is , he suggests , the raising of the body 's content of the fire above its normal share ; while the so-called imparting of a charge of resinous electricity is to be regarded as the removal of some of the body 's " stock " of electric fire whereby its content falls below the normal . The application of this hypothesis to an actual experiment may be best understood by considering the following quotation of Franklin 's own words :  | Imagine three persons , each having his normal equal share of electric fire . A , who stands on wax and rubs the tube , collects the electrical fire from himself into the glass ; and his communication with the common stock being cut off by the wax , his body is not again immediately supplied . B ( who stands on wax likewise ) passing his knuckle along near the tube , receives the fire which was collected from the glass by A ; and his communication with the common stock being likewise cut off , he retains the additional quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to be electrified ; for he having only the middle quantity of electrical fire , receives a spark upon approaching B , who has an over-quantity ; but gives to A , who has an under quantity . If A and B approach to touch each other , the spark is stronger , because the difference between them is greater . After such touch there is no spark between either of them and C , because the electrical fire is reduced to the original quantity . If they touch while electrizing the equality is never destroyed , the fire only circulating . Franklin 's hypothesis was one among dozens which went the rounds of the learned societies of the eighteenth century ; but it was as superior to all the others as was Newton 's theory of gravitation to all those ingenious but useless fabrications of his day ; and for this reason , that it merely expressed in unambiguous terms the form of the working of electric phenomena without any attempt to decide what electricity " is " . It is true that Franklin himself begged the question by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was force of habit engendered by his use of the spark as his test of its presence . As his hypothesis became established as a sound and , for all the phenomena then known , adequate theory , it was quickly realised that in describing its behaviour as he did , Franklin was postulating for the electric " fire " the well-known properties of a fluid . Thus if water is ladled from one vessel into another of equal size and shape ( both being half full to start with ) and the two are subsequently joined by a pipe , the water will rush back until the " common stock " is once more shared between them . So Franklin 's came to be known as the one fluid theory . The value of this theory is that it enables us to visualise how a very great number of diverse electrical phenomena work . The speculations of his contemporaries on the other hand in ascribing to the " effluvium " a " sulphureous " , " igneous " , " aeriform " , " etherial " , and heaven knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal much more of the nature of electricity , but in fact achieved hardly anything at all . For the  | most part such speculations are neither true nor false ; they are merely empty phrases . Franklin 's on the other hand , in so far as it does accurately reveal the form of electrical phenomena , is " true " ; but a moment 's consideration shows that it is but a beginning ; it is far from being adequate . For in the analogy of the two vessels of water just alluded to we had to premise that they should not only be equal in capacity but of the same shape ? the two conditions which must hold if equal quantities of liquid are to stand at the same level . Before Franklin 's hypothesis could be at all adequate with respect to the facts of the Leyden jar then exciting so much attention , it was necessary to discover some characteristic of the electric " fluid " which strictly corresponds to that of " head " or " level " in that of material fluids , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of a conductor for that " fluid " . Two years before Franklin 's first letter to Collinson there was born in Italy the man who more than any single investigator was destined to clear up this difficult matter . Before passing on to consider this fundamental step in the progress of electrical theory it is interesting to note how little was the early study of electricity related to man 's practical needs . Whereas the progress in magnetism was clearly the result of Europe 's need to expand markets ? an expansion which could take place only by an improvement in the speed and safety of navigation ? a hundred and fifty years after Gilbert 's recognition of the universal distribution of electricity , Watson was compelled to admit that " we are not as yet so far advanced in these discoveries as to render them conducive to the service of mankind " . Except in so far as the study of electricity began as a sequel to that of magnetism this seems a sufficient answer to those " whole hoggers " who to-day protest so loudly that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social conditions . Probably the first technological product of electrical study was Franklin 's lightning conductor ? a direct result of his disinterested experiments on point discharges . His " defying " and " bottling " of the lightning is one of the great epic stories of science . In its bringing of the " special instrument of Divine wrath " within the realm of ordinary natural phenomena  | it helped profoundly to bring about that change of attitude towards religion which is characteristic of the modern world . Footnote  | HOW THE STRANGE BEHAVIOUR OF A DEAD FROG LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF NEW ELEMENTS THE history of science , not to be outdone by the history of kings and peoples , is punctuated with a number of Good Stories which , though probably not true , are sufficiently plausible and even instructive to be worth serving up in a sober opuscule such as this ? always with the proverbial grain of salt . One of the best of these is the tradition that when the Italian physiologist , Galvani , was skinning some frogs to make a tasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convulsive movement of one of them every time he touched a nerve with a scalpel . As there are at least two other versions of the story , we may take it that they are probably imaginative reconstructions of Galvani 's formal account published in 1791 under , the title De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari Commentarius . Since these original observations have been frequently misrepresented they will be set down here in some detail . He had dissected a frog so that the legs were joined to the stump of the vertebral column by the sciatic nerve alone . When an assistant ( probably his nephew , Aldini ) touched the nerve with a scalpel the muscle of the leg contracted violently . The contraction occurred only when a neighbouring electric machine was working and when the assistant 's fingers were in contact with the metal part of the scalpel , that is when a conducting path joined the nerve to earth . Since the contractions occurred when the body was completely insulated from the machine , Galvani repeated the experiment one day when " thunder was about " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is difficult to understand why Galvani persisted with these experiments , as the contraction of muscles under the influ-  | ence of electric " shocks " had been only too familiar since the invention of the Leyden jar , and experiments had been made on isolated animal preparations as early as 1754 . Galvani 's experiments however were probably carried out five years before the paper was published , so there may have been other circumstances which he had by then forgotten . Be that as it may , his " second experiment " , as it is called , broke entirely new ground in the history of electricity . Here is his own description of the simple observation which acted as so great a stimulus on investigators all over Europe : Therefore having noticed that frog preparations which hung by copper hooks from the iron railing surrounding a balcony of our house contracted not only during thunder storms but also in fine weather , I decided to determine whether or not these contractions were due to the action of atmospheric electricity . . . Finally . . . I began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone against the iron railing to see whether by such a procedure contractions might be excited , and whether instead of an alteration in the condition of the atmospheric electricity some other changes might be effective . I then noticed frequent contractions , none of which depended on the variations of the weather . He repeated these experiments indoors using a variety of metal supports for the body and hooks for the spinal cord . Not only did contractions generally occur , but their intensity varied according to the nature of the metals constituting the " pair " . Moreover no contractions occurred when non-metallic substances were used . Galvani 's procedure had thus far been in the best traditions of scientific enquiry : the isolation of the essential conditions by means of experiments carried out in freely varied circumstances . But Galvani was primarily a physiologist , and worse still , he was specially interested in the nervous system , the physiology of which was still haunted by " subtle fluids " , " aethers " , and " acid spirits " ( p. 453 ) ; SO it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the animal itself there was an indwelling electricity . We were strengthened in such a supposition by the assumption of a very fine nervous fluid that during the phenomena flowed into the muscles from the nerves , similar to the electric current in the Leyden flask . " While admiring Galvani for his determination to find a  | relation between muscular irritability and the electric discharge , it is perhaps kinder to draw a veil over his subsequent conclusions . When men of science allow " suppositions " to be strengthened by assumptions ? especially of thin nervous fluids ( nerves are not tubes ) ? they must be left to work out their own salvations , if they can . An off-print of this paper however came into the hands of Volta , then Professor of Physics at Pavia , who seized upon all those aspects of the experiments whose significance Galvani had missed . It is almost a platitude to emphasise the degree to which the progress of science is determined by the production of instruments of precision ; but it has not been generally realised that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of his grasp of the new ideas latent in Galvani 's observations was a consequence no less of the remarkable delicacy of response to which the electrometer had been brought by the labours of himself and others during the previous twenty years . The principal cause of this increase in sensitivity was not so much the introduction of lighter conductors , such as gold leaf , but of a new method of using the instrument based on the elucidation mainly by Volta ? of the nature of the electrical condenser . We have already seen ( p. 217 ) that Franklin 's " one fluid " theory was inadequate in so far as it failed to make explicit the characteristic of the " electric fluid " corresponding to " level " in mechanical fluids : how should a small body which must have acquired only a small absolute amount of " fluid " above its " normal " share of the common stock discharge into a large body which may quite easily have a much greater absolute surplus than has the small one ? Such questions were cleared up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The former charged up a jar by a machine and measured the largest distance at which a spark would just pass ? the discharging distance ; he also , through his body , discharged the jar . Next he charged up two such jars and made them share their charge with two others . Whereas the shock of the four was rather greater than of the one , the discharging distance was only half ; he concluded that " the strength of the shock depends rather more on the quantity of fluid which  | passes through our body , than on the force with which it is impelled . " Volta summarises these ideas in an even clearer manner . Recognising that for the electric " fluid " , just as much as for milk or water , there must be a measure of what a body can " hold " , he introduced the term " capacity " .1 If a given quantity of electricity be given to a conductor , the latter produces a certain deflection of an electrometer ; if the surface of the conductor be then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity may be considered to be spread over a larger capacity , whereby its intensity is reduced . In the same way a pint of milk will stand at a lower level when transferred to a quart vessel having the same height as the pint vessel . At first sight the " fluid " theory of electricity seems to be much strengthened by this extension of its concepts , but Volta also drew attention to the remarkable fact that the intensity of electrification of a charged conductor is much reduced by the mere approach of an " earthed " conductor . For convenience we say that the capacity of the former has been increased , and the whole contrivance is called a " condenser " ; but it is surely a strange pint of milk which presses less Strongly on the bottom of the jug as soon as an empty jug with the bottom knocked out is placed beside it on the table ! So what the new views had given to the theory with one hand , they took away with the other . Moreover the recognition that the Leyden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its birth , nothing but a condenser proved that the interposition of a layer of some material other than air between the two plates of a condenser in general increases still further the capacity of the condenser . Let him who can devise an analogy for the pint of milk . It was difficulties such as these which led to the gradual replacement of the crude but serviceable " fluid " theory by the modern dynamical theory of potential . But these difficulties in theory fortunately did not prevent Volta from combining with the gold leaf electroscope the principle of the condenser , Footnote  | whereby he was able to obtain the results similar to those of Galvani , ' but without any frogs . In other words he proved that the contractions " are the effects of a very weak artificial electricity which is excited in a way of which no one had any suspicion , namely by the application of two coatings of different species of metals " . In modern terms the hook and the plate were the battery , the animal only the electrometer . When Galvani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the production of the electricity he replied in an anonymous pamphlet ( 1794 ) to the effect that a contraction of the muscle had since been observed in the absence of any metal contact merely by allowing the sciatic nerve of one leg to touch the muscle of the other ; so there is " animal electricity " after all ! The story of these events is as instructive as it is entertaining ; for it shows how important it is when proving the existence of one kind of action not to exclude the possibility of others . Galvani had unconsciously " discovered " three distinct kinds of electric phenomena , namely the propagation of electric waves from a discharging machine ( not fully explained till very much later ) , the contact difference of electric potential between dissimilar metals , and the difference of potential established within an animal body , part of whose muscle has been injured ? an effect directly demonstrated by Nobili in 1827 . Interesting as Volta 's demonstration of contact electrification is , it was only the prelude to a much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different metals in turn , Volta was able to arrange the latter in the following order : silver , copper , lead , tin , zinc ; the metals being thus in descending order of charge given to the electrometer considered algebraically , that is , silver gave a larger positive charge than copper , zinc a larger negative charge than tin , lead being almost without effect . By using frogs as indicators he was able to show that the muscular contraction could be best brought about by using a pair of metals , as far apart as possible on the list , e.g. silver and zinc ; the source of the electric " stream " being , it Footnote  | seemed , nothing but the difference of " intensity of charge " in the two metals . On 26th June i 800 the Fellows of the Royal Society heard read Volta 's famous letter to Sir Joseph Banks , their President , describing a new electric battery which would " act continuously , or whose charge after each explosion is reestablished of its own accord " . Volta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realise that by arranging suitable pairs of metallic plates in order it should be possible to build up , step by step , a battery twenty , thirty , or more times as strong as the feeble source constituted by only one such pair . It was only necessary that these pairs of plates should be put in conducting communication by means of pads of suitable material thoroughly soaked in water , or better , salt water , since the latter is a better conductor . This contrivance was the famous " Voltaic pile " , which Volta compared with the electric organ of the fish known as the " Torpedo " ( Gymnotus ) , whose structure had recently been revealed by dissection to consist of just such a number of separate units . He describes its use for giving shocks , making sparks , and for producing on the tongue an acid taste at the positive pole and an alkaline one at the negative . Thus was born the electric current whose application has transformed our civilisation . Volta had no doubt in his mind that not only does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induction in that it regenerates the charge of its own accord , but also that its discharge is a continuous process ; the evidence that he adduces for this view was the persistent taste on the tongue for so long as the battery was connected to it . Within a few months of the reading of this letter , great " piles " had been constructed in England , and before the end of the year Nicholson and Carlisle had shown that by dipping the poles of such a pile into slightly acidulated water the latter was continuously decomposed into oxygen and hydrogen ? an experiment which confirmed by analysis the composition of water revealed by Priestley , Cavendish , and Lavoisier by synthesis . Here evidently was a most potent weapon forged by the labours of physiologists and physicists now made available for ' the use of the chemist in his , so far , rather uncertain attack on the problem of the ultimate elements of matter . We have already  | seen ( p. 195 ) how the prophetic insight of Lavoisier had by analogy suspected that the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? were in fact oxides of unknown metals whose constituents were bound together by chemical forces so strong as to be impossible to overcome by any methods then known to chemical science . But the same was almost true for water ( Lavoisier had himself caused red-hot iron to extract the oxygen from steam ) ; yet here were the elements of water torn apart by the mere dipping of two wires into the liquid . The investigators who most quickly realised the immense potentialities of this new weapon and who at once applied it to the study of chemistry , were Davy in England , and Gay-Lussac and his friend and collaborator , Thenard , in France . Within twenty years of the introduction of the pile these three men had rid Lavoisier 's theory of its few serious errors and thus , save for one important aspect , completed the foundation of modern chemistry . If any man deserved the title of genius it was Humphry Davy . He was born in Penzance in 1778 ; at twenty years of age , with typically light-hearted courage , he discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gases which Priestley and others had recently discovered . At twenty-three he was assistant at the newly-founded Royal Institution in London . Before he was thirty-five he had discovered five new elements , cleared up the confusion in regard to the nature of chlorine and the nature of acidity , and discovered many curious and some highly dangerous new compounds . At forty-two he was President of the Royal Society , though continued ill-health had much curtailed his activity after 1813 . Though one of the most brilliant experimenters who ever lived , he was also one of those who saw the growing influence of science on industry and social conditions : he lectured to large and fascinated audiences on the application of ' chemistry to agriculture and , as is well known , invented the miners ' lamp . He was handsome , witty , imbued with unusual social grace , a poet of distinction and , as his diaries reveal , a philosopher in the true sense of the word . He died in 1829 . In 1807 , using the great pile which had been constructed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | elements . A vigorous action ensued , but the recognisable products , hydrogen and oxygen , were exactly the same as if water alone had been used . So Davy next tried solid potash free from water ; in this case however no action at all occurred . Most investigators would quite reasonably have concluded that potash was after all an element ; not so Davy , who had sufficient knowledge of electricity to realise that it was necessary to be sure that a circuit had been established . He therefore allowed the potash to absorb sufficient water vapour from the air to become a conductor . " Under these circumstances " , he tells us , " a vivid action was soon observed to take place . The potash began to fuse at both its points of electrization . There was a violent effervescence at its upper surface ; at the lower or negative surface there was no liberation of elastic fluid ; but small globules having a high metallic lustre , and being precisely similar in visible characters to quicksilver , appeared , some of which burnt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and others remained and were mainly tarnished and finally covered with a white film which formed on their surfaces . " Here was a remarkable fulfilment of the prophecy of Lavoisier . Who would have thought that the colourless crystalline mass , so greedy for moisture , was in fact a compound of a soft brilliant metal ? With quick realisation of the implication of this discovery , Davy repeated the attack on all those substances which were strongly alkaline , using sometimes the alkali itself , or in the cases such as lime , baryta , etc. , where the alkalis are infusible , salts of the alkalis . In every case a lustrous , highly active metal was thrust into the world by the new electric magic ? a natural magic far more potent than that dreamed of by the alchemists . Thus sodium , barium , strontium , and magnesium quickly followed potassium ; and to-day the wonderful virtuosity of Davy is reflected in the great hydro-electric units whose huge annual output of aluminium , wrenched from its earthy source of bauxite , passes into the homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Davy 's magnesium , into the chassis of myriads of aeroplanes likely , through man 's inability to control his own folly , to destroy all the wonders he has achieved . By putting the highly reactive metals , sodium and potassium ,  | into the hands of chemists , the invention of the pile had also an indirect influence on the history of chemistry . One of the first effects was the correction of Lavoisier 's statement that all acids are oxides and that the reason why certain metals disengage hydrogen from most acids is sufficiently clear when we recall that this action takes place only when the acid is mixed with water . The difficulty which Lavoisier could not explain was that from the strongest acid ? muriatic , or the " marine acid " as it was called ? no one had ever succeeded in extracting oxygen by any means ; he could only conclude that chlorine , being obtained from the acid by heating it with substances like manganese dioxide , rich in oxygen , must itself be an oxide of a higher order ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task of extracting the unknown " element " from this " oxide " . Before we consider what conclusion his successors did in fact arrive at , let us note how the discoverer of chlorine , Scheele , viewed these matters in the uncertain light of the phlogiston hypothesis . Scheele was himself the earliest discoverer of oxygen , which he first obtained some months before Priestley , but by heating manganese dioxide by itself , the very stuff with , which , by heating with the " marine acid " , he shortly after discovered chlorine . Since he regarded oxygen as dephlogisticated air ( actually he called it " fire air " ) he rightly regarded chlorine as " dephlogisticated marine acid air " . Now since in the last form of the phlogiston hypothesis " phlogiston " came to be identified with hydrogen , we have to admit , what has not perhaps been sufficiently emphasised by historians , that in this particular the phiogistonists gave an account which was , with due allowance for altered nomenclature , essentially the present view ; while Lavoisier , ? with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , was not only wrong , but a false guide to his successors . Fortunately Davy was sceptical from the first ; and having failed to obtain any evidence for the existence of oxygen either in " muriatic acid " or " oxymuriatic acid " he proceeded to a crucial experiment , namely to act on the product of dry hydrogen and " oxymuriatic acid " with his newly-discovered sodium , whereby he obtained common salt and hydrogen equal in volume to half the " muriatic acid " used . By the action of sodium on  | " oxy-muriatic acid " he obtained common salt alone . These experiments do not prove that oxygen is absent from all these substances ; they do however prove that the assumption of its presence is as gratuitous as it would be to assume the presence of phosphorus or any other element . Davy consequently restated the facts in their modern form , and first gave to oxymuriatic acid its present name of chlorine . Gay-Lussac and Thenard repeated Davy 's experiments , but at first shrank from spoiling the supposed beautiful harmony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was investigating a new element ? iodineand having found that a precisely similar interpretation applied to it and to its hydracid , he earned the right to share with Davy the credit for completing ? and correcting ? La Revolution Chimique . Footnote  | WHEN IS AN ATOM NOT AN ATOM ? Q NE of the facts mentioned in connexion with Davy 's demonstration of the elementary nature of chlorine was that the hydrogen replaced by sodium occupied exactly half the volume of the hydrogen chloride originally used . The use of quantitative evidence of this kind , which is entirely lacking in the Sceptical Chymist , became more and more frequent after La Revolution Chimique . Lavoisier 's teaching is everywhere inspired by the realisation of the decisive character of data based on measurement ; it was however left for others to establish those quantitative laws of chemical combination which set chemistry beside physics as an exact science . Though Richter had displayed remarkable industry and care in collecting data concerning the relative weights of different acids and bases which are capable of mutual neutralisation , he failed to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chemists . As has happened more than once in the history of science , an ingenious pioneer has missed the mark by failing to act on the truism " first things first " ; Richter 's work could hardly impress itself upon a generation , some of whose most brilliant minds were still in doubt as to the constancy of composition of all chemical compounds . To Lavoisier this assumption seemed so obvious that he never bothered to establish it by any experiments devised expressly for the purpose ; but his fat , good-natured , and ingenious friend , Berthollet , thought that he had sufficient evidence to cast doubt upon this assumption . In his Essai de Statique Chimique ( 1803 ) he put forward the view that by varying either the conditions of chemical reaction or the proportions of the reacting substances , it was possible to cause a variation in the composition of the product . His argument is a model of resource and insight ; he was forging a weapon which a century  | later was to play a big part in industrial civilisation ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; what he was not doing was to cast any permanent doubt upon the constancy of composition . Fortunately for the history of chemistry , his compatriot , Proust , was content to walk before he could run ; so having obtained from a fixed weight of silver the same weight of silver chloride irrespective of the method used for the conversion , he tried to convert Berthollet to a belief in the law of definite proportions , which as everyone knows ( or ought to know ) states that " every chemical compound no matter how prepared always contains the same elements in the same proportions by weight . " Berthollet took no exception to the first part of this enunciation , but he stoutly maintained that whereas in ordinary laboratory operations sodium carbonate forms calcium carbonate from soluble calcium salts , yet on the shores of the Dead Sea sodium carbonate is found mixed with sodium chloride as a result of the action of the huge excess of the latter on the solid calcium carbonate rock . Without knowing it Berthollet was bringing forward evidence for the now well-established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this law , but he had enough horse sense to see that Berthollet 's argument concerned not the proportion of elements in chemical individuals but the proportion of certain chemical individuals formed in complex mixtures . In further arguments which Berthollet put forward Proust detected a failure on the former 's part to recognise that his products were not chemical individuals at all . By sticking to the point Proust brought the controversy to a timely conclusion ; but as always happens when a great man has erred , Berthollet 's confused recognition of a vital element in chemical reaction ? a dynamic equilibrium easily upset by altering the conditions ? was thrust into the background for more than half a century . While this was going on more than one man of science was trying to puzzle out " the law behind the law " . By what mechanism does it come about that pure chemical substances , so different from plum cakes , are formed only of definite proportions of elements , an excess of any of the latter being left over ? The man who had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Manchester schoolmaster , John  | Dalton . The exact train of reasoning by which Dalton came to see in the observed regularities of chemical action the workings of ultimate particles , which he called " atoms " , has been the subject of much speculation and dispute . In this book we shall merely state the rival views as to the genesis of Dalton 's hypothesis without attempting to decide between them . For in the author 's opinion the evidence is far too scanty to permit of any clear-cut decision , and it is at least doubtful whether Dalton himself was conscious of any strictly logical process of arriving at his results . The facts of the matter are as follows . In the course of an account of the composition of the atmosphere , read in 18021 to the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester , Dalton had occasion to mention that in the estimation of oxygen by combining it with nitric oxide , the two gases may be completely removed by using either 36 or 72 parts of nitric oxide for every 100 of air . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the theory of the process : the elements of oxygen may combine with a certain portion of nitrous gas , or with twice that portion , but with no intermediate quantity " . He added no explanation of this rather unexpected phenomenon . In 18031 he read another paper to the same society in which he described the discovery of his famous law of partial pressures of gases , which he used to explain the fact that the volume of , a gas dissolved by a given volume of water is the same whether the gas forms part of a mixture of gases or whether the same weight of the gas occupies the same volume as did the original mixture . Here Dalton freely speaks about the " particles " of gases though no one had ever seen such a " particle " . Between 1802 and 1807 Dalton discovered by experiments with gases that the case of the dual proportions of combination of oxygen and nitric oxide referred to above is no isolated one . Many well-known compounds exist which permitted him to enunciate the " law of multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one proportion , then the volumes of one of those elements combined with a fixed volume of the other are in simple numerical proportion " . Dalton hit upon this Footnote  | law , which might have remained hidden to the most accurate experimentalist , as a result of his ingenious idea of comparing the quantities of the one element not in a hundred parts of compound , but combined with a fixed quantity of the other element . The law was extended to solids ( by expressing the ratios as weights instead of as volumes ) by W. H. Wollaston in i 808 . In i 807 Thomas Thomson included in his own book , A System of Chemistry , a short account of Dalton 's atomic theory of chemical combination , which did not materially differ from the exposition given by Dalton himself in i 8o8 in his book , A New System of Chemical Philosophy . The details of this theory are well known to all those who have even a slight acquaintance with chemistry ; but it is necessary to state them here in Dalton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position to assess as nearly as possible the exact relation of the theory to present-day views on the mechanism of chemical combination . " Chemical analysis and synthesis " , he writes , " go no further than the separation of particles one from another , and to their reunion . No new creation or destruction of matter is within the reach of chemical agency . We might as well attempt to introduce a new planet into the solar system , or to annihilate one already in existence , as to create or destroy a particle of hydrogen . " Thus far there is little in Dalton 's hypothesis which could not be found in Lucretius ' De Rerum Natura ; but in what follows Dalton put forward what he considers to be an experimental verification of what , with Lucretius and his masters , was but ingenious and fruitful speculation . " In all chemical investigations " , Dalton continues , " it has justly been considered an important object to ascertain the relative weights of the simples which constitute a compound . But unfortunately the enquiry has terminated here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relative weights of the ultimate particles or atoms of the bodies might have been inferred from which their number and weight in various other compounds would appear , in order to assist and to guide future investigations , and to correct their results . " He then proceeds to give a number of rules for determining the relative weights of the atoms , the combining proportions of whose elements have been measured . Thus , " when only one combination of two bodies can be obtained ,  | it must be presumed to be a binaryl one , unless some cause appear to the contrary " . . . " From the application of these rules , to the chemical facts already well ascertained , we deduce the following conclusions : first , that water is a binary compound of hydrogen and oxygen , and the relative weights of the two elementary atoms are as z : 7 , nearly . . . " Finally Dalton , realising the " novelty as well as the importance of the ideas " , appended a plate of diagrams to illustrate in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The above quotations provide a condensed , but I believe fair , account of Dalton 's hypothesis . To what extent was it an advance on contemporary views and how far has it stood the test of time ? Though Dalton did not invent either the concept or the word " atom " , it is clear that he extended its range . Previous to Dalton the word " atom " stood for the supposed ultimate particles into which lumps of matter could be sub-divided . There was no direct evidence for the existence of any such particles ; in fact so astute a mind as Descartes ' had created a picture of the physical world on the assumption of continuity , that is the denial of the existence of atoms . The notion of atoms was born in Greece from purely metaphysical needs and was revived by Boyle , Gassendi , and Newton mainly for mathematical convenience . Dalton 's hypothesis is to the effect that these ultimate physical particles are also the ultimate units of chemical synthesis . We now know ( p. 237 ) that this is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a poor foundation for Dalton 's fame . But it is not all . The objection to the " classical " atoms was the absence of any means by which they could be brought even indirectly within the realm of the senses . By pointing out the constancy of the weights of his " chemical " atoms relative to that of the hydrogen atom taken as unity , Dalton gave them a place in the " solid ground of nature " previously denied them . It is of course true that the actual values of these relative weights depended on his assumption , made with the foolhardiness of the pioneer , that the simplest combining ratios were necessarily the atomic ratios , but the inaccuracy of Dalton 's weights does not Footnote  | alter the fact that it was he who first showed that such weights can be arrived at . What gives Dalton 's hypothesis its place of honour in the history of chemistry is undoubtedly the law of multiple proportions . The experimental fact that with a given quantity of carbon either one or two parts by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that any intermediate quantity of oxygen will produce a mixture of these two , constitutes in itself , if rightly considered , a guarantee that this action is atomic in character . For , without making any assumptions as to whether oxygen and carbon atoms " exist " , it does unambiguously imply that oxygen can enter into chemical association with carbon only in " sealed packets " which can not be split . The law of multiple proportions , established by Dalton for several instances of gaseous compounds and extended by Wollaston to a number of solid salts , is an experimental fact which anyone may verify for himself , not only in the case of those substances investigated by the great pioneers but in numerous other cases rendered more tractable by modern technique . The implication of the law , that chemical action is atomic in character , is therefore as certain as the law itself . If Kepler 's laws are held to imply a " law " of gravitation , the law of multiple proportions just as certainly implies an " atomic law of chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many writers of elementary text books have assumed that Dalton 's atomic hypothesis arose in his mind as an explanation ( or implication ) of his previously discovered law of multiple proportions . We have insufficient evidence to warrant an explicit denial of this view ; but if it were true , then the subsequent development of Dalton 's thought betokens a much more muddle-headed nature than we believe Dalton to have been . It is much more likely that the concept of atoms arose in Dalton 's mind in the form of Newton 's " hard , massy , particles " , but now endowed with Newtonian forces . Having then by a bold flight of genius glimpsed chemical action as an interplay between such corpuscles , he was delighted to find in the law of multiple proportions a striking verification of his speculation . If this be a correct reading of history , we are perectly right in speaking of " Dalton 's atomic hypothesis " ( or in the  | light of its continued verification , theory ) for though the experimental law of multiple proportions necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place only between " packets " of a limited degree of smallness , it does not imply that these ultimate quantities exist as free particles . An illustration from a humbler sphere may perhaps clarify the point . An observer from another planet might , in happier days , have established the empirical law that the transfer of sausages from grocer to consumer always occurred in packets of a limited degree of smallness ; but he would find out later that such an atomicity of sausage-transfer was not incompatible with the subdivision of a sausage-atom for purposes of consumption ? it is not necessary to cook a whole pound packet at one go . In this homely illustration ( conceived , it is true , when the grocer 's sausage-atom was a pound ! ) the atom of transfer is seen to be divisible into smaller units for other purposes ; thus it might have happened that the atom of chemical action might be divisible into smaller units when acting in a non-chemical capacity . While Dalton was excogitating his theory that great French experimentalist , Gay-Lussac , had discovered an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely that each of the " hard , massy , particles " , an unbelievably numerous swarm of which constitutes a bubble of oxygen , is in fact composed of at least two such units of chemical action . Gay-Lussac 's memoir on the volumetric composition of gases was read in i 8o8 and published in 1809 . Partly from experiments in which the volumes were directly measured , and partly by converting the ratios by weight into ratios by volume by the simple expedient of dividing the weights by the respective densities , he was able to announce his well-known law that " the compounds of gaseous substances with each other are always formed in very simple ratios , so that representing one of the terms by unity , the other is i , or 2 , or at most 3 " . It will be recalled ( p. 234 ) that in order to fix the relative weights of the atoms Dalton had to assume that when only one compound was known ( e.g. water , ammonia ) , it was composed of only one atom of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . This was patently a weak spot in his theory ?  | how weak , was to be realised only after half a century of confusion . No blame is to be attached to Dalton for making the assumption that in the absence of evidence the simplest composition is the most likely ; but unfortunately he seems later to have forgotten that it was an assumption , and to have treated it as an integral part of the theory . In no other way can we explain his attitude to Gay-Lussac 's law . Gay-Lussac contented himself with stating the facts ; Dalton , one might have thought , would have given these facts the most careful consideration in the hope of being able to find a connexion between this law of simple integral volume relations and the similar integral relations which he believed to subsist between the numbers of atoms in familiar compounds , But for no apparent reason other than the fact that the acceptance of the actual volume relations found by Gay-Lussac would have compelled him to modify his own assumptions concerning the " binary " character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far departed from the ideal implied in all scientific investigation as to reject the facts rather than his own hypothesis , until there should , in his own naive words , be some " reason " discovered for them . Thus a regrettable prejudice prevented Dalton from recognising this heaven-sent means of clearing up the obscurities in his own system . Meanwhile in 1811 there had appeared a monograph for whose misunderstanding and neglect chemists had in the subsequent half century to pay dearly indeed . This was An Essay on the Manner of Determining the Relative Masses of the Elementary Molecules of Bodies , and the Proportions in which they enter into these Compounds . It was written by the Italian physicist , Amedeo Avogadro , and within the space of twenty odd pages so completely corrected and amplified Dalton 's atomic theory that it should be rightly regarded as forming with the latter the basis of all subsequent theory of chemical structure . The basic assumption of Avogadro 's hypothesis , which he believed to be inevitable in view of Gay-Lussac 's law , was " the supposition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same for equal volumes , or always proportional to the volumes " . From this assumption follows very simply the inference that the relative weights of the molecules of any two gases are to  | one another as the densities of the gases under similar conditions . Avogadro at once recognised the difficulty which arose when the hypothesis was applied to compound substances , " for instance , the volume of water in the gaseous state is , as M. Gay-Lussac has shown , twice as great as the volume of oxygen which enters into it . " How can this be so unless the molecule of oxygen be divided between two molecules of hydrogen ? Dalton with characteristic insight had sensed this very difficulty before Avogadro had approached it , and had in consequence rejected the very hypothesis which the latter was now putting forward . To Dalton the ultimate particles of elementary bodies ( what Avogadro calls " molecules " ) were unbreakable ; any hypothesis which involved their disruption must be ipso facto false . Avogadro however took a larger view : " We suppose , namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( i.e. the molecules which are at such a distance from each other that they can not exercise their mutual action ) are not formed of a solitary elementary molecule , but are made up of a certain number of these molecules united by attraction to form a single one . " Avogadro went on to explain how this modification may be applied to the case of chemical combination . He has been accused of obscurity of diction and ambiguity in the use of terms . His occasional guilt in respect of the former accusation is such as to preclude lengthy quotation here ; but although he uses the term " molecule " to mean several different things , he qualifies it in such a way as to make it quite clear to what it refers in each particular context . He gives several examples of the application of his hypothesis , the most important being that " the integral molecule of water will be composed of a half molecule of oxygen with one molecule or , what is the same thing , two half molecules of hydrogen . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new term for his " solitary elementary molecules " ? what we now call " atoms " ; if he had done so the subsequent history of chemistry might have been far different from what it actually was . But at the same time it is remarkable that not one of the ingenious chemists then living had wit enough to unravel the slight tangle of terms with which he presented them . It must be supposed that the authority of Dalton , who had got in first ,  | blinded them to any contribution which even seemed to contradict his views . Avogadro himself suffered from no such diffidence : " Dalton " , he wrote , " on arbitrary suppositions as to the most likely relative number of molecules ( atoms , in Dalton 's phrase ) in compounds , has endeavoured to fix ratios between the masses of the molecules of simple substances . " What follows is Avogadro 's crowning achievement . By means of carefully worked-out examples he shows that not only are the molecular weights of gaseous elements and compounds in proportion to their densities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these elements which form gaseous compounds may be deduced from the volumetric relationships involved in those compounds . Thus , since two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen form two volumes of water , the molecule of water must contain a half molecule of oxygen united with two half molecules of hydrogen ; if therefore one part by weight of hydrogen unites with eight parts by weight of oxygen , it must follow that the " elementary molecule " of oxygen weighs sixteen times as much as that of hydrogen . But these particles are what Dalton meant , or ought to have meant , by " atoms " ; so we have a means of determining certain atomic weights free from those arbitrary assumptions which Avogadro rightly complains of and Dalton came to regard as sacred . Avogadro himself at the end of his memoir recognised that his " hypothesis . . . is at bottom merely Dalton 's system furnished with a new means of precision from the connexion we have found between it and the general fact established by M. Gay-Lussac . " But Avogadro stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least consistent in rejecting both Gay-Lussac 's Law ( p. 237 ) and Avogadro 's mediating hypothesis ; other chemists , with a peculiar lack of logic , ignored the hypothesis while admitting that unless Gay-Lussac was a liar , his law must stand . The results of this extraordinary situation may be read with great patience and no little boredom in the struggles of the great chemists of the first half of the nineteenth century to find a consistent system of atomic weights . The history of this branch of chemistry is of interest chiefly as a commentary on the human mind ; it is a succession of ingenious and even heroic attempts to find a way out of a situation which , but for prejudice and purblindness , need  | never have arisen . Into this jungle of controversy we do not intend to lead the reader ; for after half a century of nightmare in which a chemist might , and often did , have to alter the formula of the same compound several times during the course of the study of its derivatives , a fellow countryman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently by the hand , and led it back to an understanding of the words addressed to it , but disregarded nearly fifty years before . All that Cannizzaro did was to make clearer the relation between the atom and the molecule which , as we have seen , was insufficiently explicit in Avogadro 's memoir , and by the application of technique invented during the intervening years , to extend the latter 's notion of molecular weights to elements like sulphur , phosphorus , and mercury , which do not normally exist as gases . Baldly stated it seems a small title to fame ; but one has only to apply a test similar to that referred to in the case of Lavoisier ( p. 194 ) , namely to compare original memoirs written before and after Cannizzaro 's famous lecture of 1858 . In this case it is formulae to which one pays special attention . In the earlier papers we have the same symbols ( modified by Berzelius from Dalton 's original suggestions ) as we use to-day , but combined in a staggering confusion . Thus water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - 02 according to the school of thought of the author . Within a few years the mists of confusion vanished , and the familiar inorganic compounds appeared in their present-day attire . The whole development of the theory of chemical structure is based on these words of Cannizzaro : " The different amounts of one and the same element contained in different molecules are all of them whole multiples of a certain quantity which , since it is always found undivided in compounds , is rightly denoted an atom . " Here at last is the true definition of the atom ; true , because it works ; and here also is the relation between the atom and the only other unit of structure , the molecule . Whereas the latter is the ultimate unit of matter in bulk , division of which is impossible without altering the properties of that matter , the atom is Footnote  | the ultimate unit of chemical action , division of which was at that time unimaginable , because meaningless . For chemically compounded matter the atom and the molecule are in a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy it as water . For elementary matter the atom and the molecule may be , and in certain cases , such as mercury and the inert gases , actually are , the same ; but in the vast majority of cases they are not . Divide a quantity of oxygen as often as you like , and you will ultimately arrive at a molecule ; further division into particles of oxygen is impossible even in imagination . This point has not always been made sufficiently clear , even in modern text books ; for if a molecule of oxygen be further sub-divided the atoms which result would not be " oxygen " , as the molecules are , but " oxygen atoms " . This is not a mere verbal quibble ; for if it be suggested that a collection of " oxygen atoms " is identical with " oxygen " , how could it ever come about that oxygen is always found in diatomic molecules ? The difference is here stressed from the point of view of logic , because it is always difficult to be sure when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but experiment and theory seem to reinforce one another in the view here emphasised , namely that oxygen atoms do behave differently from oxygen ; and it is its behaviour which determines the nature of a scientific object . We are now in a position to answer the question put at the head of this chapter : " When is an atom not an atom ? " The answer which Avogadro urged in rather misleading terms was , " When it 's a molecule . " But from our modern standpoint a better answer would be , " It all depends . " The word " atom " means literally " uncut-able " . In so far as the atoms of Lucretius applied only to the drying up of puddles , the deposition of dew , the smell of the flowers in a neighbouring field , and the gradual wearing away of the stone steps of an ancient castle , then the atomic ( better " molecular " ) theory of the Greeks is even truer to-day ( apart from certain inessential details ) than when it was first put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ever-widening field of phenomena , and found adequate for their explanation . The " hard , massy , particles " of Newton are the Greek  | atoms endowed with the quantitative attributes of mass and weight . The concept of " centre of gravity " by which the " force " apparently inherent in every particle of matter is treated as if it were concentrated at a geometrical point , is atomism par excellence ; for is not a " point " the essence of indivisibility ? Dalton 's atomic hypothesis , in so far as it expresses the facts summarised in the law of multiple proportions , maintains its essential truth despite all the sensational atom-splitting which has become the commonplace of modern physics . Thousands of experiments performed by an army of chemists throughout the world depend for their usefulness on the unquestioned acceptance of the belief that chemical reaction does actually occur between units whose weights are characteristic of the several elements , but which show no deviation with the passage of time or the variation of the conditions of the experiment . The atomic theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remains as true to-day as when it first took its final shape . But it is no longer as adequate . The atoms still perform their ceaseless rounds , weaving new patterns and dissolving old ones ; chemistry is still the science of these atomic patterns . Within the context of chemical events the atoms are ultimate ; but during the last half century forces have been unleashed which were never dreamed of by Dalton nor even by Cannizzaro . In the stress of hyper-electric fields , in the shattering impact of the a-particle or the neutron , compared with which an aerial bomb on the same scale would be a mere ping-pong ball , the units of chemical change break asunder into smaller units . To Dalton , as to Newton , the atom was an ultimate simplicity ; Faraday evidently knew better , for in 1853 with prophetic genius he wrote : " As to the little solid particles which are by some supposed to exist independent of the forces of matter . . . as I can not form any idea of them apart from the forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Faraday , matter and its atoms are the " forces of matter " ? there is no " dead " residue which " exerts " forces on other " dead " residues . And it is thus that we are beginning to regard those enormously stable but complex entities , the chemical atoms . With these words the reader may feel that he is being pulled  | into deep water , in which there is no firm ground of observation to rest on : how can matter be force ? This is indeed a profound mystery ; but it is no more of a mystery than the " commonsense " view of a featureless matter " exerting " forces . Moreover it is a mystery whose steady contemplation gives place , as do some of the mysteries of religious experience , to a light in which our perplexities appear though more profound , yet at the same time less ' confused . The history of this mode of thought is the history of the electromagnetic field ; so we shall now retrace our steps to the University of Copenhagen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the much sought-for relation between the magnetic and electric " fluids " . Footnote  | THE NEWTON OF ELECTRICITY ON account of the many resemblances ? creation by friction , induction , polarity , and many more ? between the electric and magnetic " fluids " , it is not surprising that , as Oersted himself reminds us , " certain very celebrated physicists " had attempted to discover a reaction between electricity and the magnetic needle . But in vain ; for the excellent reason that between static electric charge and magnetism there is no connexion at all . On the other hand it is difficult to understand why up to the year 1819 no one had been more successful by using the - " voltaic current " , which , as we have seen , was employed by Davy , for instance , to release new elements . In his first memoir on the subject ( July 1820 ) Oersted remarks that in experiments set on foot at the classes for " electricity , galvanism , and magnetism " held during the previous winter , " it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its position by the help of a galvanic apparatus " . Realising the importance of the subject , and thus wishing to remove all doubt as to the suspected effect , he gathered together a body of " most learned men " ( whose distinctions , decorations , and offices are recorded by him with the same precision as the apparatus ) to witness a repetition of the experiment . In his description of these experiments Oersted shows himself to be imbued with the true scientific spirit . Wires of different metals were used and their place and direction altered in every conceivable way . The upshot was ? which must at first have surprised him more than he admits ? that the effect is at all marked only when the conductor is held parallel to the axis of the needle , whether above , below , or at the side ; and the direction of the motion can be summarised in the words " the pole over which negative electricity enters is turned towards the west , that  | under which it enters towards the east . " From all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be one of simple attraction such as occurs between magnetic poles or electric charges . As to the cause he is less clear ; for he nowhere speaks of an electric current , but only of an electric " conflict " which must " perform gyrations " in the space surrounding the conductor . The idea of a conflict is the inevitable consequence of prejudice in favour of a two-fluid hypothesis . In attributing to it the power of gyration he seems not to distinguish between the motion of the " conflict " and the direction of the reaction between it and the magnetic fluid . All things considered however , Oersted claims our respect for having provided his contemporaries with a sound basis of observation on which to construct their own more elaborate enquiries . The effect on the European Academies was literally electric , but nowhere so great as in France . Within four months of the publication of the above paper , three further contributions to the science of electro-magnetism had been read to the Academie des Sciences ; they were published in the same volume ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first of these contributions was made jointly by Biot and Savart and was concerned with the development of a quantitative expression of Oersted 's qualitative observation . To put this in proper historical perspective it will be necessary first to make good an omission in the account we have so far given ( Ch . XIX ) of the early development of magnetism and electricity . Just as Volta 's elucidation of the mechanism of the " galvanic " circuit was made possible by the refinement of an instrument of precision the electrometer ? so the establishment of a complete theory of electro-magnetism would have been far slower but for the invention of the torsion balance by Coulomb . Coulomb was one of the first of the long line of military engineers who played so great a part in the advance of physics in France during the transition from the eighteenth to the nineteenth century . In 1784 he described to the Academy a piece of apparatus consisting of a cylindrical wire stretched vertically by a series of narrow cylindrical weights whose oscillations about the axis of suspension under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to  | deduce a law connecting the degree of torsion with the dimensions of the wire , the material of the latter determining a numerical constant . By using wire whose torsion when submitted to a given force could be calculated from its dimensions , he showed how extremely small forces could be measured . The production of such an instrument illustrates incidentally the advance in metallurgy which permitted of the drawing of a sufficiently uniform wire . In the following year ( publication was delayed until 1788 ) he described the application of this balance to the determination of the laws of reaction between both magnetic poles and electric charges . As every student of elementary electricity and magnetism knows , these laws are of the same form as one another , and as of the law of gravitation , namely that the reaction is inversely proportional to the square of the distances between the reacting centres . It is interesting to note that Coulomb had first to demonstrate the existence of such " centres " ? the analogues of the centre of gravity in Newton 's law . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magnetic reaction like any other mechanical force , and so compare the strengths of magnets by measuring the force they could exert on , for instance , another magnet oscillating at a given distance . It was therefore a natural step to take to enquire whether the law of electromagnetism was of the same form . This Biot and Savart did by measuring the rate of oscillation of a suspended magnet when placed at various distances from a conductor joining the poles of a voltaic pile . The result was to show that , in their own words , if " from a point where the molecule of austral or boreal magnetism is , a perpendicular be drawn to the axis of the wire , the force which acts on the molecule is perpendicular to this line and to the axis of the wire . Its intensity is inversely as the distance " .1 The force is therefore of the familiar form except for the startling fact that the force on the " molecule " of magnetism acts not along the line joining it perpendicularly to the conductor , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " molecules " of magnetism reveals the dominance of the idea of atomicity in regard to all the constituent factors of nature ? an idea derived from the Footnote  | astounding success of the Newtonian law of reaction between " particles " , and receiving a new access of strength from its extension by Dalton to the case of chemical action . But in its demonstration of the tangential action of the " electromagnetic force " the new law was sounding the death knell of this domination . The second contribution came from Arago . In repeating the experiments of Oersted he noticed that " the same current produces a strong development of the magnetic condition in bars of iron or steel which were before entirely devoid of it " . The " electromagnetic " force therefore resembled that of a simple magnet , not only in its power of reaction with an existing magnet , but also in the ability to induce magnetism in unmagnetised materials . The last of the contributions referred to was to mark the beginning of one of the most superb flights of the human genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric current by another current , the terrestrial globe , or a magnet . The author was Andre Marie Ampere who at an early age showed such a deep insight into the mathematical theory of games of chance as to attract the attention of Delambre . Later he independently recognised the principle generally known by Avogadro 's name , and became one of that great company of the Ecole Polytechnique to which reference has already been made . What distinguishes Ampere 's paper from all contemporary contributions was his immediate recognition of the possibility of mutual mechanical reaction between two currents ? no magnet , nor even magnetic material being necessary . Before describing the beautifully contrived apparatus by which this result was demonstrated he was at great pains to clarify the existing confusion of thought concerning the nature of a " current of electricity " . The term " current " doubtless derived from the conception of electricity as a " subtle fluid " which , as it were , flowed in the form of a spark from a body highly charged with it into one less charged . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course have provided the means of passing a spark between the terminals . But there was as yet no clear recognition of anything continuously flowing along a conducting path between  | these terminals ? a state of affairs quite different from that in which the terminals were made to operate an electrometer . At the outset of his paper Ampere defines the former state as electric current and the latter as electric tension . In the former case " there is no longer any electric tension , light bodies are not sensibly attracted , and the ordinary electrometer can no longer be of service to indicate what is going on in the body ; nevertheless the electromotive action continues ; for if , for example , water or an acid or an alkali or a saline solution forms part of the circuit , these bodies are decomposed . . . and furthermore as M. Oersted has recently discovered when the electromotive action is made by the contact of metals , the magnetic needle is turned from its direction when it is placed near any portion of the circuit ; but these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needle comes back to its ordinary position as soon as the circuit is broken , when the tension is re-established and light bodies are again attracted " . Here in a nutshell is the clue to the modern interpretation of electricity . Gone is the duality between " frictional " and " galvanic " ( or " voltaic " ) electricity ; the latter is merely the continuous flow of the former whose behaviour towards an electrometer represents the " tension " which is the cause of the flow . From this " tension " came the term " electromotive force " , a term still in use though much to be deplored , since it is not a " force " but a state of being , better described as a " potential " . And it is clear , as Ampere himself emphasised , that it is only the . current , that is electricity in motion , which generates magnetic effects . Conversely the magnetic needle , suitably mounted , provides the counterpart to the electrometer , namely an instrument to measure the current , an instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first use to which Ampere put this new instrument was to demonstrate that the current flows in a circuit ? that is not only from the terminal of the pile outwards through the conducting wire or solution , but also through the pile itself , only in the opposite sense as shown by the opposite deflection of the needle . It is only here that a modern electrician finds Ampere 's account difficult to follow ? though perfectly consistent with itself ? for he uses the " two fluid " theory of electricity and so speaks of a  | " double current , one of positive electricity , the other of negative electricity , starting out in opposite senses from the points where the electromotive action arises , and going out to reunite in the part of the circuit remote from these points " . One can not help feeling dissatisfied with these opposing streams ; where do they meet , for instance ? If at a point midway between the poles , why does the whole conductor acquire new properties ? Such questions do not seem to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he was looking for the form of the law of reaction between two neighbouring currents and this , like the quantitative expression of the phenomena of heat , is independent of the nature of the electric current . Thus far there is nothing fundamentally new in Ampere 's contribution , though by his clear distinction between " current " and " electromotive tension " he has clarified the whole situation . But the next step is revolutionary , namely his demonstration that two delicately balanced wires , in which currents are flowing , attract one another when the currents flow in the same direction , repel one another when the currents flow in opposite directions , and these reactions begin and end with the closing and opening of the circuit . This experiment shows in the simplest manner why we are compelled to postulate some kind of motion associated with the wire . We can not see the current ; we see only identical wires whose ends are joined to zinc and copper terminals . A mere reversal of the ends of one of these wires reverses the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ends " of the wires are not identical . Alternatively we may simply turn one wire round through 18o ? ; the result is the same as before . Now the only way a straight wire can acquire a " head " and a " tail " is for it to move , or for the direction of motion of something else to be determined by it . It has in technical terms acquired vectorial properties . The idea is of course implied in Oersted 's experiments ; it is merely made more explicit in Ampere 's . Moreover it not only shows that something 's motion is directed by the wire , but also that there need be no more than one such stuff to explain all the phenomena . The epoch-making character of this discovery was made explicit by the title Ampere gave to his paper of 1822 , Experi-  | ments on the New Electrodynamical Phenomena ; a title which he elaborated in a note , in which the following passage occurs : " I have determined to use the word electrodynamic in order to unite under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to designate those which I have observed between two voltaic conductors . It expresses their true character , that of being produced by electricity in motion : while the electric attractions and repulsions , which have been known for a long time , are electrostatic phenomena produced by the unequal distribution of electricity at rest in the bodies in which they are observed . " To make this point clear beyond the shadow of a doubt , namely that the magnetic effects follow from the mere motion of electricity , Ampere showed that the effect is exactly reproduced if a current from the same pile is sent successively through the parallel wires free to move at right angles to their axes . There can thus be no question of the reaction of charges on the pile ; moreover it is to be noted that the effect is altered inappreciably even when the reacting wires are at a great distance from the pile ? a circumstance which suggested to Ampere the possible application of the phenomenon to the transmission of messages between distant stations , electric telegraphy in fact . Finally it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currents is opposite to that of electric charges , for it is currents flowing from like poles which attract one another . The many respects in which a current of electricity resembles a magnet naturally suggested that the former might share with the latter the power of induction and also that of orientating itself with respect to the magnetic poles of the earth . The former as we have seen was first demonstrated by Arago for a straight conductor , but on the advice of Ampere he repeated the experiment using a conducting helix , or solenoid , as Ampere called it , with much greater effect . The second property was much more difficult to bring about owing to the weak magnetic force of the earth , but Ampere ultimately succeeded by means of his ingenious use of mercury contacts into which the ends of moving conductors could be made to dip . It is thus clear that a current-bearing conductor has all the  | properties of an intact magnet . It can not of course be divided like a magnet , since this would involve breaking the circuit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore the challenge to prove either that a current-bearing conductor has the exact form of an assemblage of molecular magnets laid side by side along its axis with all their poles pointing in the same direction , or that the axis of every magnet is in effect the axis of an assemblage of circular current elements which encircle it and whose planes are all perpendicular to the axis ? an assemblage called by Ampere an " electrodynamic solenoid " . Which of these two is correct ? We are here faced once again by the sort of problem exemplified for the first time by the status of the earth in space , and , on a level of much greater complexity , by the rival theories of light . It would take too long to set out all the arguments on both sides : arguments which were sufficiently cogent to lead such eminent thinkers as Wollaston and Berzelius to adopt the former . In fact Ampere seems at first to have been almost alone in at once recognising the superiority of the latter . From the standpoint of the modern philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the problem of gravitation , we no longer ask which of the two electromagnetic theories is the " correct " one . But we can decisively say that although the theory which gives to the magnetic element a more ultimate character does explain many of the phenomena , yet there is , as in the case of light , an experimentum crucis , which while not proving the alternative theory " right " does rule out the former as inadequate . This experiment was carried out by Faraday in September 1 821 : he found that when a wire connected to one pole of a battery was allowed to hang in a bowl of mercury connected to the other pole , so that the submerged end was free to move , then on placing a magnet vertically within the mercury , the submerged end of the wire at once began to describe a circle about the magnet , and continued to do so for as long as the current passed . Now it is of the essence of magnets that all their movements are brought about by couples , consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why this must be so in the light of modern mechanical views : continuous motion must involve the performance of work , and it is clear that a magnet  | can not supply the energy for this work . This was not fully understood at the time ; but there was no doubt that the theory which involved something in motion ? the electric current ? was more acceptable as an explanation of the continuous motion of the magnet than one in which the sole causative agent was an assemblage of magnet-couples . That Ampere should thus have been able to reduce the whole range of electromagnetic phenomena then known ? the reaction between the electric current and the magnet , the mutual reaction of currents and of magnets , and the reaction of both with the earth to the form of classical mechanics , thus earning for himself the title of founder of electrodynamics , might be regarded as a sufficient triumph for one man . But the greater triumph is yet to tell , namely the deduction of the quantitative law from which all these reactions might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in difficulty the simple law verified ( by Coulomb , and earlier , though unpublished , by Cavendish ) for electric charges , and by Coulomb for magnetic poles ; for not only does the force vary with change of the distance between the reacting circuits but also with their directions relative to one another . Here in fact was the one peculiarity of the new branch of dynamics , namely that the force acts at right angles to the line joining the reacting elements , which prevented its ready acceptance by physicists . To solve the problem Ampere had to call in the aid of the calculus ? a mathematical weapon much extended in its range and sharpened in its application since its invention by Newton had rendered possible the solution of the somewhat similar problem of a planet 's motion , constantly changing in magnitude and direction . The analysis Ampere brought to bear was long and involved , but the expedient he ultimately contrived to solve a problem whose direct solution would probably have surpassed the mathematical resources of his day is one of such beauty and wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . The analytical nature of the infinitesimal calculus is well shown by the problem under consideration . The only procedure which can yield any information as to the reaction between  | circuits is to consider two elements , that is , regions of two neighbouring circuits whose length is considered as smaller than any assignable quantity . To fix , the directions of these elements with respect to one another it is necessary , following the method derived from Descartes , to fix the direction of each with respect to the same three mutually perpendicular axes of space . The only other variable is the distance between these elements , that is , the length of the straight line joining them . The problem has now been analysed into the relations between the functions of two variables , distance and direction ; but the nature of the functions , that is whether for instance it is the square or the cube of the distance which is involved , is as yet unknown . Direct appeal to experiment is impossible , since elements of circuits are ideal constructions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a whole . The usual procedure in such a case is to integrate , or " add up " , all the elements between certain defined values of the variables ? a process which is possible only if the functions of these variables are known or can be expressed as a function of something else which is known or can be guessed from experiment . Ampere started out on this line of attack , but could make little headway . Now , as every schoolboy knows , there are often two ways of solving problems , the austere way of calculating from the data what the answer must be , and the quicker way , often calling for much ingenuity , of looking up the answer and working backwards . This is what in effect Ampere did . It is in fact a special form of analysis peculiarly applicable to physical problems ; for in physical problems there is often one answer which can be stated with certainty and reproduced experimentally , namely the answer " nought " , when all the mutually opposing factors cancel out . Ampere described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It consists in proving by experiment that the movable parts of the conductors are , in certain cases , exactly in equilibrium under the action of equal forces or equal moments of rotation , whatever may otherwise be the form of the movable part , and to seek directly by calculation what must be the value of the reaction between two infinitely small portions such that the equilibrium may in fact be independent of the form of the moving part . " He had then no longer to express the reaction in  | terms of a relation between unknown functions of two variables , but to find such a relation as would in given circumstances be equal to nothing . He was able by beautifully contrived experiments to find three such cases . The general nature of these cases may be derived from a consideration of one of them , in which he showed that the actions on a movable straight conductor of two fixed conductors , equal in length and placed at the same distance from it , the one straight and the other twisted into any shape whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , taken right round a closed circuit , no matter what the shape of the circuit may be , is zero ; also that the force due to any element of circuit may be resolved into two components ? one , the effective one , at right angles to the movable conductor , and another perpendicular to the former ? a further justification of the term electrodynamics , seeing that this is precisely the law found by Newton for ordinary forces and known as the " parallelogram law " . With these results Ampere was able to determine the unknown functions and write the equations from which the whole theory of electrodynamics has been derived . It is little wonder that in reviewing the subject many years later , Maxwell was to write : " The whole theory and experiment seems as if it had leaped full grown and full armed from the brain of the Newton of electricity . It is perfect in form , and unassailable in accuracy , and it is summed up in a formula from which all the phenomena may be deduced , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Footnote  | FROM COLOURED FLAMES TO STAR STUFF THE story of the generalisation of " radiation " is full of moral value for the historian of science . Like many moral stories it begins in humble surroundings ; for Joseph Frauenhofer was the son of a poor glazier and spent his early years in assisting his father . So skilled did he become that before he was twenty-five he had become superintendent of the glass melting and grinding processes at the neighbouring optical institute ; at thirty-one he took charge of the institute which thereafter removed to Munich . The importance of these details of his life lies in the fact that it was solely for the purpose of comparing the refractive indices of different kinds of glass for light of different colours , that he made the experiments that are the starting point of the mighty structure of modern spectroscopy . The necessity for this investigation lay not in any attempt to clarify theory but in the hope of improving achromatic objectives . Once again a purely technological end was the means of opening up a completely new and astoundingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in which the light from an oil lamp was refracted through a flint glass prism and viewed by means of a telescope . With the magnification effected by the latter Frauenhofer saw what Newton failed to do , namely a line in the yellow region shining more brightly than the neighbouring part of the spectrum . And now follows a further moral . For though Frauenhofer at once recognised the usefulness of this line for the determination of refractive indices of different glasses , he did not rest content with this discovery . Is this not one mark of distinction between the technician and the man of science , that the latter is always searching behind the particular instance for the general law ? So it was at any rate with Frauenhofer ; for  | having satisfied himself of the existence of precisely similar lines in the light from tallow and many other forms of " fire " he " wished to find out " , as he tells us , " whether a similar bright line could be seen in the spectrum of sunlight as in the spectrum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an almost countless number of strong and feeble vertical lines , which however were darker than the other parts of the spectrum " . In further experiments he found the bright line again in the flames of hydrogen , alcohol , and sulphur . Moreover he added physical to the astronomical evidence that the planet Venus shines with light reflected from the sun , for in its light appeared many of the dark lines seen only in sunlight . A report of these investigations appeared in 1814-I5 , but the presence of dark lines in sunlight had already been observed by Wollaston in 1802 . Why did this ingenious man carry out no further investigations of this interesting phenomenon ? Is it not significant that Wollaston 's interest had a strongly chemical bias ? there was not the urge to apply the discovery to any practical end ? How else can we account for his naive theory that the five most prominent lines were the natural boundaries of the " four simple colours " ? The moral thus appears complete ; but not so the story . For it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the dark solar lines or the bright line seemingly universal in terrestrial flames . It was unfortunate for him that sodium compounds are so widely dispersed as to be almost universal , thereby hiding the fact that the line is a specific test for sodium vapour . Was it the lack of chemical knowledge which prevented Frauenhofer from examining flames coloured for instance by saltpetre or copper salts ? Or was he the victim of his own narrow aim , now perfectly fulfilled in the discovery of precise landmarks , for the comparison of refractive indices ? Perhaps we are too prone to look for a single cause for the trends in scientific advance ; more likely is it that in addition to the factors already mentioned was the fact that his publications aroused no interest among physicists , who were too preoccupied with theoretical disputes . Be this as it may , the attack had to be taken up from many other directions before the Frauenhofer lines were explained  | or the basis of chemical spectroscopy established . This in no way detracts from the greatness of Frauenhofer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first showed how to make , little further progress would have been possible . In a book such as this , where we are concerned more with principles than a plain historical record , it will be impossible to do justice to the numerous discoveries which enlarged the boundaries of the spectrum and brought to mankind the realisation that the physical world is filled with unseen agencies as numerous and varied in their powers as any imagined in a spiritual world . It must suffice to recall that by 1859 ? the year of the first paper by Bunsen and Kirchhoff on spectral analysis ? the simple visual spectrum had been pushed beyond the red by William Herschel and beyond the violet by Wollaston and Ritter ; the emission of bright lines by hot gases had been observed by Fox Talbot ; the selective absorption of light passing through coloured substances by Brewster . Moreover W. A. Miller and Foucault had independently shown the exact coincidence of the yellow lines of sodium with the dark I ) lines of the solar spectrum ; and the possibility of the latter 's being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact been seriously considered . The mere fact that these various phenomena had been observed by so many investigators ? and many more not mentioned here ? seemed to lead to confused notions as to their cause . One of the most influential factors in bringing about this wide interest was undoubtedly the introduction of photography which , originating in the classical observation of the darkening of silver chloride by Scheele in 777 , was first used for making permanent records of spectra by J. W. Draper about 184o . Draper it was who came nearest to the complete solution of the problem of spectra . Born in 1811 at St. Ilelens in Lancashire , he was one of the first students of the newly-founded University of London , and later migrated to the I.J.S.A. where he filled Chairs of Chemistry and Physiology . In his most important memoir of 1847 he drew attention to the fact previously overlooked that all solids , at least , become incandescent at the same temperature ; that the infra red rays are emitted at lower temperatures , and that as the temperature rises rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Owing to the absence of any flame devoid of glowing solid particles he mistakenly announced that the spectra of gases resemble those of solids , but may have bright lines in addition . In 1854 began one of those partnerships , comparatively rare in the history of science , between two men of complementary characters , which has been the means of clarifying realms of knowledge hitherto confused by the very multitude of separate workers cultivating them . Kirchhoff was a cautious speculator and one of the founders of mathematical physics in its postKantian , critical form ; Bunsen , whom he met at Heidelberg in 1854 , was on the other hand a daring and resourceful experimenter , whose work on the derivatives of the deadly substance , cacodyl , was one of the foundation stones of organic chemistry . It seems that the first purpose of the two investigators was to establish beyond a doubt the , as yet , uncertain belief that the vapour of every chemical element emits , when sufficiently hot , a light which can be resolved by a prism into a characteristic set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sodium , a red one in that of lithium , and so on . What had so far prevented any final decision on this point was the absence of any flame free from glowing solids which produce a continuous " rainbow " spectrum . It was for this purpose that Bunsen devised the superbly simple burner which bears his name . The strongest testimony to its excellence is the fact that ninety years after its invention it is still the standard heating unit of the chemist and is the basis of the majority of those domestic appliances ? fires , ovens , incandescent lighting ? which have done so much , and could do so much more , to lighten labour and reduce dirt and fumes . There is a moral in this story too ; for it shows how untenable is the view of those enthusiasts who see in every scientific advance a direct response to social needs : the precise opposite is here the case . Though to give them their due it must be admitted that Bunsen 's burner would have had small chance to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distillation of coal to lighten the nights of London and other cities forty years before . With this new weapon Bunsen and Kirchhoff quickly established that most fertile application of physics to chemistry ? spectrum analysis . The results for chemistry were literally  | spectacular . Bunsen and Kirchhoff themselves discovered rubidium and caesium in the Durkheim mineral water ? metals which would never have been distinguished from potassium except , as was the case with Plattner , as a discrepancy in the numerical result of analysis . ' Crookes followed with thallium ; then came the numerous rare earths . Most sensational of all was the announcement by Janssen and Lockyer independently of a line hitherto unnoticed in the sun 's spectrum corresponding to no known terrestrial element . So reliable was the new spectrum analysis that this element , unseen as such by human eye , was appropriately called " helium " . Before the close of the century Ramsay had obtained measurable quantities from various terrestrial sources . Valuable as has been this application to chemistry , of far more fundamental importance was the explanation of the Frauenhofer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one previously restricted to the transmission of heat . This explanation had in fact been described by Kirchhoff in a paper published a year earlier than the joint paper : " In order to test " , he writes , " in the most direct manner possible the frequently asserted fact of the coincidence of the sodium lines with the lines D of Frauenhofer , I obtained a tolerably bright solar spectrum , and brought a flame coloured by sodium in front of the slit . I then saw the dark lines D ( of the solar spectrum ) change into bright ones . " So far Kirchhoff had merely confirmed " the frequently asserted fact " ; thus , he continues , " in order to find out the extent to which the intensity of the solar spectrum could be increased without impairing the distinctness of the sodium lines , I allowed the full sunshine to shine through the sodium flame and to my astonishment I saw that the dark lines D appeared with an extraordinary degree of clearness . " Thus the darkness of the lines could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when an effect is increased by altering a given factor in the experiment , it is natural to suppose that this factor is the cause , or a part of the cause , of the phenomenon . He there-Footnote  | fore felt driven to the conclusion that ordinary sunlight has already passed through sodium vapour before reaching the earth , presumably in the sun . The next step was to make a terrestrial model of the supposed action , namely a continuous spectrum of a lump of lime glowing in the oxy-hydrogen flame . As soon as an alcohol flame highly charged with salt was interposed between the lime and the prism , the D lines appeared . Repeating the experiment with strontium , potassium and iron , he obtained similar results . Lastly he introduced lithium into the alcohol flame , and obtained a dark line in the same position as the bright red line of this element , although the solar spectrum contained no such dark line . From all this he concluded that " a coloured flame , in whose spectrum bright sharp lines occur , so weakens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass through it , that dark lines appear in place of the bright ones , whenever a source of light of sufficient intensity , in whose spectrum these lines are otherwise absent , is brought behind the flame . " The single phenomenon of the D line had thus been generalised , but no physical explanation had been put forward . At the conclusion of the paper he noted however that if instead of an alcohol flame he used a bunsen flame , then however little salt it might contain , the bright sodium lines alone showed themselves . This provided a clue to the mechanism of the phenomenon . In order to understand how Kirchhoff was able to develop this hint , we must turn aside for a moment to a discovery of great importance in the transmission of heat . Although Lavoisier ( p. 202 ) had given his blessing to a widespread belief in the existence of an actual substance whose transfer constituted the addition or subtraction of heat , he never supported the common man 's belief in the existence of a separate " cold " substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pictet noticed that a thermometer placed at the focus of a concave mirror showed a fall in temperature when a block of ice was placed at the focus of a similar mirror opposite the former . This was an awkward fact : it was difficult to see how the " caloric " in a thermometer suddenly became aware of the altered situation and began to leave home and to fill up the region around the ice which had become deficient . The solution of this problem  | was a principle of cardinal importance in physics , too often rather lightly passed over in elementary work : this was the conception due to Prevost ( 1791 ) of a " movable equilibrium of temperatures " ? surely a singularly far-seeing conception at a time when the essentially dynamic nature of most physico-chemical equilibria ( see later p. 295 on the phase rule and law of mass action ) was still to be formulated . That heat could travel at great speeds in a similar manner to light , as well as being slowly conducted or convected by particles of matter , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrations might be the means of its transmission in the form of " radiation " ; but with the rise of the caloric theory radiation had sunk into the background , probably through the absence of instruments sufficiently delicate to put it on to a quantitative basis . But Prevost boldly put forward the proposition that all bodies , are perpetually emitting caloric in straight lines , and that the rate of emission is proportional to the quantity of caloric in the body ? a measure of which is given by the temperature . Nor does this process cease when all bodies in a region have reached the same temperature ? a state of affairs which on the contrary simply means that emission and absorption by every body are equal . With this ingenious hypothesis it is easy to explain the behaviour of the thermometer referred to above without having recourse to any separate " frigoric " . I t is a state of affairs which would naturally ensue from the fact that less caloric is radiated from ice than from neighbouring bodies such as the thermometer ; hence the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equilibrium point is reached , when emission is once again equal to absorption . Though Prevost was firmly convinced that " caloric " was a " specific fluid " , he nevertheless added , " if those who believe otherwise substitute waves for an emission , they may be able , perhaps , to adapt to their opinion the explanations which I give for phenomena of this class . " Among those who " believed otherwise " were Balfour Stewart in Edinburgh and Kirchhoff himself . A new weapon had meanwhile been forged by Nobili and Melloni ? this was the t liermopile , whose action depended on the multiplication of the minute differences of potential , developed by maintaining two  | metallic junctions at different temperatures ; Nobili 's share of the work being in the perfection of a galvanometer sufficiently sensitive to measure the minute currents generated . The thermolectric effect itself had been first observed by Seebeck , and had played an immensely important part in the development of current measurement , since no other source of potential difference was sufficiently constant and reproducible to enable G.S . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indispensable rule of every working electrician . By means of the thermopile Melloni had been able to demonstrate that radiant heat resembles light precisely in being reflected , refracted , and polarised . When the power of this new weapon was brought to his notice by Forbes , Balfour Stewart set to work to compare the emissive and absorptive powers of a wide range of substances in various conditions , using lamp black ( assumed absolutely non-reflective ) as the standard of reference . From the results he obtained he was able to conclude that " the absorption of a plate equals its radiation , and that for every description of heat " , that is to say , for each distinct wave length . Kirchhoff independently developed the same conception , and by means of a mathematical argument of great elegance deduced Balfour Stewart 's law as a necessary consequence of the " law of equivalence of heat and work " . The argument was based on two concepts , that of " heat enclosure " ( here we recognise the idea of a thermally isolated system ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he writes , " the enclosure to be composed , wholly or in great part , of bodies which , for infinitely small thickness , completely absorb all rays which fall upon them . . . A black body , in this sense of the word , must have the same refractive index as the medium in which the radiation takes place ; then there will be no reflection at its surface , and all incident rays will be wholly absorbed . " From these " units of thought " Kirchhoff deduced ( first for black bodies ) the law , " The ratio between . the emissive and the absorptive power is the same for all bodies at the same temperature " , the equivalent of Balfour Stewart 's law quoted above . Kirchhoff pointed out that though this involved Draper 's observation that all bodies begin to emit waves of the same wave length at the same temperature , the intensity of rays of a certain  | wave length emitted by different bodies at the same temperature may be very different . " A body that remains perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Into a ring of platinum wire of about 5 mm. diameter I introduced some phosphate of soda and heated it in the nonluminous flame of the Bunsen burner . The salt melted and formed a fluid lens and remained perfectly clear ; but it emitted no light , while the platinum ring in contact with it radiated the most brilliant light . " It is now easy to understand the genesis of the Frauenhofer and other dark lines . For if , as is the case , a gas radiates light of a certain definite wave length , it must according to Kirchhoff 's law also absorb radiation of the same wave length . Moreover , if it is at a lower temperature than the source from which it is receiving radiation corresponding to a given band of wave lengths , it will absorb more of each wave length than it radiates ; for this state is , according to the theory of exchanges , just what constitutes difference of temperature . The result will be relative darkness in those regions of the continuous spectrum which would otherwise have been formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frauenhofer lines in the solar spectrum were caused by selective absorption by vapours , in the relatively cool outer layers of the sun , of certain wave lengths from the continuous band emitted from the glowing semi-solid interior . It therefore remained only to identify the lines by causing samples of the terrestrial elements to radiate , after which it could be asserted with some confidence what terrestrial elements are present also in the sun . With the improvement of refracting telescopes , optical glass , and photographic methods , it became possible to extend this method to the analysis of the stars and even nebulae . Moreover the use , of the spectrometer is not confined to the determination of the composition of the celestial bodies , for in 1842 Doppler demonstrated that just as sound changes in pitch ( frequency ) when the emitting body is moving relatively to the observer , so , if light is also , as was generally believed at that time , a periodic phenomenon , its colour ( which is correlated with frequency ) should vary in a similar way . Actually owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a body can be swift  | enough to cause change of colour but only minute shifts in the spectral lines . Over twenty years had to pass before Huggins in 1868 , and Vogel in 1871 , were able to detect a difference in the wave lengths of lines observed on the approaching and receding limb of the sun . In the hands of modern astronomers the spectroscope has given information concerning the motion , age , and life history of the stars , and the rotation of nebulae , and has recently led to that somewhat fantastic hypothesis of the expanding universe . From this hypothesis have been drawn the most farreaching consequences as to the origin and destiny of the cosmos , but in applying a purely physical hypothesis to problems which ultimately lie outside the realm of purely physical concepts , too little attention has been paid to the danger of building such an imposing superstructure on the assumption of only one possible interpretation of a certain physical fact . For while it is undoubtedly true that the shift of the spectrum of a nebula is positively correlated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equally true that we know of no other cause of such a shift than a high velocity of recession of the emitting body , it ought to be admitted ( which it generally has not been ) that other causes are conceivable or at least not inherently impossible . The subject is however of great fascination and admirably illustrates that pervasive connectedness between the sublime and the trivial which the progress of science so consistently reveals . The concepts of " heat enclosure " and " black body radiation " ( often called " full radiation " ) have played a part in the development of physics comparable to that played by the " reversible cycle " ( see p. 278 ) . The importance of the black body is due to the fact that the behaviour of such a substance is unaffected by its chemical constitution and depends only on the temperature of the enclosure ; thus we have a unit of measurement for radiation corresponding in some measure to the thermodynamic temperature scale ( see p. 283 ) whose importance is of the same character , namely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not permit of our following up the fascinating implications of this concept ; to give a mere catalogue of names and discoveries in so difficult a subject would be futile . Suffice it to say that step by step , not without the appearance of discrepant  | features , progress was made to a stage where it appeared possible to calculate the distribution of energy in a full radiator merely as a function of the temperature ; for it must be clearly understood that a full radiator emits energy of all possible wave lengths between limits fixed by the temperature , but in no case is the energy equally distributed between these wave lengths . The radiation of the sun , for instance , spreads from the infra red through visible to ultra violet ; but the greatest proportion of the energy of clear sky sunlight is in the orange-red . Sunlight analysed in the stratosphere would show a striking shift of this maximum towards the violet ; the difference is due to the selective absorption of the lower wave lengths brought about by our atmosphere , without which absorption no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now when attempts were made , from very general assumptions as to the dynamical character of the " ether " , to deduce the distribution of energy in a full radiator , results were obtained which were completely at variance with the results of experiment . Once again , as so often in the history of science , apparent failure was the fore-runner of resounding triumph . This triumph was of course the recognition of the " atomicity " of energy exchange demonstrated by Max Planck in the early years of this century . As part of the contemporary battlefield it lies outside the scope of this book . The third approach to the relation between absorption and radiation was made by G. G. Stokes , Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge , and like his great forbear , Isaac Newton , a man of great resource in experiment . Whereas Balfour Stewart approached the problem from the infra red , Kirchhoff Ii-om the visible Frauenhofer lines , Stokes was prompted to his formulation of the relationship by a phenomenon first noticed by . J. F. W. Herschel , namely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when viewed by transmitted light and in light from most parts of the spectrum , yet when held in such a position that the blue-violet , and in particular the ultra violet , region of the spectrum fell upon it , glowed with a bright blue light . A similar phenomenon had been noticed by Brewster in the case of an alcoholic solution of chlorophyll , which however glows with a red light . Both these investigators had made im-  | portant contributions to the theory of polarised light , so they naturally expected that these new colours were the result of some form of polarisation such as occurs in thin flakes of tourmaline ; but the emitted light was not polarised . Stokes ' study of the problem illustrates the necessity of logical analysis and courageous acceptance of the inference , even when that inference appears absurd in the light of contemporary knowledge . This is what he himself wrote : The firm conviction which he Stokes felt that two portions of light were not distinguishable as to their nature , otherwise than by refrangibility and state of polarisation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation of the phenomenon . In fact having regarded it at first as an axiom that dispersed light of any particular refrangibility could only have arisen from light of the same refrangibility contained in the incident beam , he was led by necessity to adopt hypotheses of so artificial a character as to render them wholly improbable . He was thus compelled to adopt the other alternative , namely to suppose that in the process of internal dispersion the refrangibility of light had been changed . Startling as such a supposition might appear at first sight , the ease with which it accounted for the whole phenomenon was such as already to produce a strong probability of its truth . Thus by rejecting , for a particular case , what Newton had with such labour and clarity demonstrated to be true for dispersion in general , Stokes was able to explain this phenomenon of " internal dispersion " . To avoid confusion , this term , which is really misleading , as it is not a refraction effect but rather a molecular one , has been replaced by that of fluorescence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of absorbing radiation of one wave length and emitting it at a longer wave length , Stokes developed the resonance theory of absorption . It is well known that if a tuning fork of a certain frequency is struck , it may cause such vigorous " sympathetic " vibrations in some neighbouring objects as to cause them to emit sounds . The effect is far greater in those objects which , if struck , would emit the same note as the tuning fork , that is , those which have the same natural period of oscillation . Stokes conceived the atoms of sodium , for instance , to have similarly a natural period of oscillation . When therefore radiation of a band of frequencies containing this frequency passes through a mass of sodium vapour , the energy is , as it were , drained out of the incident beam  | in just that frequency , it being transferred to the sodium atoms to increase the amplitude of their oscillations ; consequently the beam will be relatively poorer in that frequency and the Frauenhofer dark line will appear . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the molecular constitution of the substance is such that the energy thus absorbed by resonance is " degraded " into a lower frequency before emission . In a similar way phosphorescent substances emit the absorbed energy at a reduced rate , so are able to continue emission for some time after absorption has ceased . The subsequent history of fluorescence was spectacular ; for in seeking for a persistence of fluorescence in uranium salts after removal of the exciting light , Becquerel discovered that these salts emitted rays even when no previous excitation had occurred ; hence was born the science of radioactivity . Stokes ' paper on fluorescence was published in 1852 ; the resonance theory of the Frauenhofer lines was never actually published but had been put forward in the course of conversation with Lord Kelvin , who later claimed for Stokes priority over Kirchhoff . Stokes himself replied as follows : " I have never attempted to claim for myself any part of Kirchhoff 's admirable discovery , and can not help thinking that some of my friends have been over zealous in my cause " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seekers after truth " . Footnote  | THE " GO " OF THINGS TOWARDS the end of the last chapter a new term was surreptitiously introduced ? I say " surreptitiously " because it does not occur in the works of either Kirchhoff ' or Stokes , in the elucidation of which I have used it . The word is " energy " . A modern writer attempting to condense and paraphrase the classical memoirs on radiation is constantly driven towards the use of this term , which he well knows became current coin in scientific transactions only some years after the theory of radiation in a quite general form had been firmly established . This experience is perhaps not without its significance for the history of science ; it shows that physics was breaking through its material bonds into the realm which now appears the more fundamental . To put it another way , the reign of mere " stuff " , which was the product of the Newtonian revolution , was coming to an end . Though the recognition of the essential association of motion ( force ) with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all along on matter ; as to the force , " hypotheses non fingo " . But with the development of the physics of radiation the emphasis is reversed ? the preoccupation is not so much with the emitters as with what is emitted and propagated . Nor was this the beginning of a change in emphasis ; it goes back to a revolution no less important than the Newtonian revolution , that is the Industrial Revolution , which was the result of the availability and mobility of prime movers . But it was essential to be able to compare the powers of these prime movers . James Watt , the honest , accurate , practical-minded genius , knew that his engine would sell only if compared with the existing prime mover ? the horse ? so he saddled us with a unit which contains the inconvenient factors 5 and i i ! As we shall see in the sequel , the development of one Footnote  | of the major branches of modern physics sprang from an attempt to set up a theoretical standard for the " motive power " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that interest in power and energy the emphasis was first on the former , though the distinction was necessarily blurred ? dated only from the social need for a standard . The germs of scientific advance can usually be traced for centuries before the time that they become empirically developed ; the social environment does however seem to determine which of these germs shall spring into active growth . The distinction between " stuff " ( a ; A ) and the " go " ( EVEpyaa ) , whereby it develops towards the perfection ( Ev ? EAEXeLa ) proper to its kind , was the essence of the metaphysics of Aristotle who , wiser than the mechanistic materialist of the eighteenth century , saw that the " go " and the " stuff " are only different aspects of the same thing ? mere matter would be literally nonentity , mere form being found nowhere in nature , being indeed God Himself , the " Form of Forms " ? " pure act " in the suggestive phrase of St. Thomas Aquinas . Unfortunately Aristotle suffered , as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a brilliant and persuasive teacher . Aristotle was an outstanding biologist , and his metaphysics of inward drive towards a dimly perceived ' end was no idle dreaming , but a profound intuition based on observation ( see later Ch . XXV ) . But , being compelled with the amiable optimism of the Greeks to frame a complete account of the workings of nature , he took over from his master the worst features of a " physics " based purely on geometrical imagery ? a one-sided view , which the shifting of a few blocks of stone might have served to correct , and thus started the building of a mountain of rubbish , beneath which the true genius of this remarkable roan was hidden until recent times . So the " germ " of energy remained frozen in a museum of Platonic forms , which determined the " proper place " of every natural object ; which restricted change to a mere return to the status quo . One might have expected that a clearer idea of the " go " of things would have been reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact this was implicit in ' Archimedes ' distinction between ( iurce and moment of force . But that great genius seems to have  | regarded his own inventions as playthings , of which he was rather ashamed . The above reference to St. Thomas *ill show that the idea of action ? closely related to the notion of physical energy ? was the mainspring of that last vigorous movement of the Middle Ages ; a period which modern historical research has shown to be much more fertile in invention than was previously realized . But although there was no dearth of mechanisms , theory was restricted to meteoric flashes of genius such as Buridan and Nicholas of Cusa , both of whom in rather different ways recognised the cramping artificiality of the Aristotelian physics . There was still however a gulf between the people who worked the machine and those who speculated upon the nature of motion itself . The brightest of all these , Leonardo da Vinci , not only invented , at any rate in his own mind , many mechanical devices which were actually created only much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes that he had a clear idea of what he called the " potential lever " , that is , the perpendicular distance from the axis on to the line of action of the force . He was not alone in this : both Ubaldi and Stevinus reached the same conclusion by different routes . Leonardo had the misfortune to be born just too soon . The growth of trade , the accumulation of capital , the rise of city-states and later of nation-states , the consequent growth of armies with an increased need for good communications , weapons and supplies , had begun ; but it had not yet reached full stature . Otherwise it is almost certain- that instead of dying with the greater part of his inventions unknown for three centuries , his claim to universal fame resting chiefly on The Last Supper and Mona Lisa , he would , like the Duke of Plaza Toro , have turned himself into a limited company and endowed the " Leonardo Laboratory " at the University of Florence . A more important step towards the formation of the concept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem of vectors on the fact that an endless chain hung over a triangular support with unequal sides does not , can not , move . For if it did , since nothing in the arrangement has been changed by the movement , it would move for ever . Therefore a long chain ( greater weight ) on a gentle incline is equal to a short chain  | ( less weight ) on a steeper incline . Here in the denial of perpetual motion is the positing of the problem of work ; and in the fiction of the endless chain is the first step towards its quantitative solution . No further advance in the development of our ideas of the " go " of things was possible until the laws of motion had been clearly enunciated by Galileo . Newton was born at the time when astronomy was reaching its climax ? his formulation of the laws of motion therefore took the form of expressing the " go " of things ( Newton 's " quantity of motion " ) as a function of time . In this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Newton ; but , less cautious than Newton , he stated it to be the only fundamental quantity and therefore fixed in amount . From this it seemed to follow that the " go " of any system depended solely on the quantity of motion in it . This result , the argument for which was couched in theological terms , having a strongly Aristotelian flavour , was attacked by Leibniz . The article of the Acta Eruditorum ( 1686 ) in which this attack was made well repays reading , as revealing the hopeless confusion which reigned in regard to such terms as force , motive force , body , quantity of motion . Leibniz distinguishes , which Descartes did not , between motive force and quantity of motion , but in referring to body fails to distinguish between mass and weight , and finally confuses , as Mach pointed out , the measure of effective force , and the question as to what is conserved . To make this latter point clear it will be necessary to summarise Leibniz 's argument very briefly . Leibniz starts from two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbing forces , a body in falling acquires a " force " sufficient to raise it to the height from which it had fallen , and ( 2 ) as much " force " is used to raise a " body , weighing one pound to the height of four ells , as to raise a body B weighing four pounds to the height of one ell " . Here he uses the term " force " in two different senses , namely ( 1 ) momentum and ( 2 ) work , neither of them equivalent to Newton 's definition as that which is proportional to the change of momentum the one accepted to-day . He then proceeds to argue that the body A in falling four ells has acquired the same " force " as the body B has in falling one ell , and this because each has now sufficient force to  | return it to its original height . But since , as Galileo had shown , the velocity acquired by A is only twice that acquired by B , the quantity of motion gained by A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite correctly concluded that " there is a great difference between motive force and quantity of motion " , and quite dogmatically continued that " from this it appears in what way the force should be estimated from the quantity of the effect which it is able to produce ; for example , from the height to which it can lift a heavy body of known magnitude and nature , not from the velocity that it can impress upon the body " . This assertion is dogmatic in the sense that the definition of " force " is quite arbitrary ; it is neither better nor worse than Descartes ' . The " simple demonstration " was entirely irrelevant to the " nature of things " and was concerned merely with a choice of definitions ; it was certainly no basis for the patronising manner in which Leibniz asserted that " Descartes , by an error common to great men , became a little too confident " . The more one reads of the squabbles between the Cartesians and the Leibnizians the more one realises the greatness of Newton , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth seems to be that the continental thinkers had failed to rid themselves of metaphysical crudities deriving from theological preoccupations . Newton was just as much engaged on theological issues as they were , but he had the admirable English faculty of keeping the two realms apart . It may be admitted that this delimitation can not be permanent if the human race is to avoid mental disintegration , but it was essential , at that stage of development of physics , that clear and unambiguous concepts and definit ions should alone be enunciated even if they were later discovered to be inadequate or based on over-simplified assumptions . That the whole dispute was entirely metaphysical and consequently futile from the point of view of mechanics was argued with clarity by D'Alembert in his Traite de Dynamique ( 1743 ) . " All that we see distinctly in the motion of a body is that the body traverses a certain distance and that it takes a certain time to t raverse that distance . It is from this one idea that all the priniples of mechanics should be drawn . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion , obscure and metaphysical  | entities which can only cast shadows on a science that is in itself clear . " Here we have the ruthless abstraction which foreshadows the criticism applied a century later by Ernst Mach to the whole Newtonian conceptual scheme . D'Alembert is undoubtedly right in rejecting " forces inherent in bodies in motion " which is a relic of animism and is entirely irrelevant to the science of mechanics . But though he shows clearly the cause of the long and futile controversy concerning the measure of " forces " by " quantity of motion " ( proportional to velocity ) or vis viva ( proportional to square of velocity ) he did not perhaps sufficiently realise the growing importance of the concept of work . It is perhaps not without significance that this concept of work was clearly defined first in relation to purely statical ' problems . This was done by Jean Bernoulli in a letter written in 1717 to the French mathematician , Varignon , who was so struck by its generality and beauty that he set it forth in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly , the proposition amounts to the statement that if in any system of forces in equilibrium one of them is given a very small displacement , then all the remainder will adjust themselves so that the algebraic sum of all the products of the several forces and their respective displacements in the direction of their lines of action will be zero . This is the principle now known as the principle of virtual work , though to add to the modern reader 's confusion Bernoulli called these products ? the virtual " works " of the forces ? their " energies " . We might now without error call them changes of potential energy , but the correlative concept of kinetic energy was not introduced until nearly a hundred years later . Meanwhile Lagrange had derived the whole of his superb Mechanique Analytique ( 1788 ) by the application of analysis to the principle of virtual work in such a way that the problems of mechanics , which Newton had reduced to problems of geometry , Footnote  | could be posited in the form of equations ( i.e. relations between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a profound influence on the development of physics . It subsequently caused a striking acceleration of progress and an extension of vision into unexpected fields ; but it did so at the expense of cutting much thought adrift from the " solid ground of nature " in the aim to achieve merely formal elegance and consistency . We shall return to this subject in the next chapter . Meanwhile all this had been achieved without any clear idea of the nature of energy having been formulated . Why was this ? It is at least plausible to suppose that it was just about this time that the steam engine passed from the pumping to the rotary stage ? previously mechanics was largely concerned with the problems of structures ? bridges and fortifications . It is significant that in the Bakerian Lecture in which Young confirmed the falsity of measuring force by the product of mass and velocity squared , proposing the term energy for the latter quantity , he refers to Smeaton , an early pioneer of the steam engine , as one who had raised the question . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical concept of kinetic energy might never have been reached or at any rate been widely used , had it not been forced upon man 's attention by the need to find a relation between work and heat . We have already seen how the quantitative basis of the science of heat had been laid by Black and Lavoisier before the close of the eighteenth century . It was a practical engineer , Benjamin Thomson ( Count Rumford ) who in 1798 first suggested the inadequacy of the caloric hypothesis . His rough but ingenious experiments carried out with a specially bluntened borer on brass castings in a cannon foundry showed without a doubt that heat was not a " subtle fluid " extruded from the pores of material bodies , but was in some way provoked by friction . Rumford 's clear understanding of what was at issue is shown by his subsequent demonstration that the capacity for heat of the brass turnings did not materially differ from that of a block of the same weight . There could be no question of a " loss " of something previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it is hardly necessary to add that anything which any insulated body ,  | or system of bodies , can continue to furnish without limitation , can not possibly be a material substance ; and it appears to me to be extremely difficult , if not quite impossible , to form any distinct idea of anything capable of being excited and communicated in the manner the Heat was excited and communicated in these Experiments , except it be MOTION " . The creation of a new " climate of opinion " is evidenced by Davy 's youthful experiments " with a peculiar mechanism " whereby ice was melted without addition of heat . The fact that Davy 's optimism concerning the complete exclusion of heat invalidates the demonstration , does not alter the interesting fact that he thought it worth attempting . Moreover at the end of the description of this and similar experiments he expresses the opinion that heat is " the power which prevents the actual contact of the corpuscles of bodies " , adding less happily that " it may with propriety be called the repulsive motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at issue . The supporters of both hypotheses regarded motion as constitutive of the phenomena of heat , but whereas at the end of the eighteenth century the prevailing fashion was to regard any such motion as being in fact the motion of particles of the hypothetical " fluid " , caloric , the view being urged by Rumford and Davy was in the orthodox line of physics from William of Occam , namely that caloric is superfluous , the heat of a body being nothing more than the motion of the particles of matter . This was not . a new hypothesis ; it had been stated confusedly by Boyle ( who unfortunately ascribed weight to the " corpuscles of fire " ) , with a fair degree of precision by Hooke , and in mathematical terms by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738 , in a work that laid the basis of modern hydrodynamics . What was new was the attempt , qualitatively successful , to demonstrate it by direct experiment . But physics thrives neither on hypothesis nor on qualitative demonstration , but on quantitative law ; and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical motion it had to wait nearly half a century . It is interesting to speculate why this was so . One reason perhaps was the fact that during this period the best intellects in physics had all they could manage in establishing the undulatory  | theory of the propagation of light , the laws of magnetism and of electrodynamics . Another reason was the necessity for the establishing of detailed quantitative relationships between heat and matter , which were carried out by Dalton and Gay-Lussac ( thermal expansion of gases and pressure of vapours ) and by Dulong and Petit ( atomic mass and specific heat ) . During this period also fundamental observations were made on the functional relationship between temperature and aggregational state ( Cagniard de la Tour 1822 , Faraday 1823 ) . All these advances were essential for the full understanding of the theory of the steam engine ? Cagniard de la Tour expressly mentions this in his paper ? but the obstinacy with which the caloric theory was retained is evidenced by the long absence of any attempt to investigate the possible relation between heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the attempt was made it was argued in terms of a flow of caloric . It has been pointed out by Pledge ( Science Since 1500 ) how well the history of steam power illustrates the difference between the British and French intellectual tempers . In Britain the invention of the piston engine in its modern form was quickly recognised as being a major event in the history of technology ; but it was in France , where the spread of steam power was much slower , that the first analysis of the physical relation between heat and power was undertaken . The small memoir of Sadi Carnot , a product of the Ecole Polytechnique , and captain of military engineers , was published in 1824 under the title Reflexions sur la Puissance Motrice du Feu . Nowhere in the history of science is the close relation of technological progress and enlargement of theory more closely demonstrated . At the very beginning of this epoch-making memoir the question is asked , " What happens , in fact , in a steam engine at work ? " The analysis which follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow of caloric ? doubtless under the influence of the highly suggestive Theorie Analytique de la Chaleur published by Fourier two years previously . The caloric flows with the steam ; it is stated categorically that " the production of motive power in the steam engine is therefore not due to a real consumption of the caloric , but to its transfer from a hotter to a  | colder body ? that is to say , to the re-establishment of its equilibrium ... " ( italics mine ) . It is clear that Carnot is here misled by the universal practice at that time of over-stretching the analogy between " palpable " and " impalpable " fluids . Fourier 's Theorie was faultless in so far as it relates only to the " flowiness " of heat ; Carnot 's result was completely erroneous in so far as it was concerned with the question , " How is work obtained from heat ? " If this is so , why is Carnot 's memoir regarded as one of the masterpieces of scientific reasoning ? The answer amounts to the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the actual characteristics of heat were irrelevant ; and for the purpose of answering these questions he devised an analytical weapon ? the reversible cycle of operations ? which has been well described ( by Pledge ) as the essential " unit of thought " for an immense branch of physics and physical chemistry ? a branch commonly known as " thermodynamics " or " energetics " . What then were these questions ? With commendable clarity he enunciates them himself . First , " Is the motive power of heat invariable in quantity or does it vary with the agent which one uses to obtain it . . . ? " To answer this he employs only well attested facts , for instance that " wherever there is a difference of temperature the production of motive power is possible " , and vice versa . But in order to isolate this action he is compelled to carry through the operations in such a way that if they were reversed in sequence , the original state of affairs would be re-established . In this way the incalculable factors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual engine works in this way ; but the postulation of such an " engine " provides a unit or norm by which all such processes can be compared . The answer to the question is stated as follows : " The maximum motive power resulting from the use of steam is also the maximum motive power which can be obtained by any other means . " The second question is little more than a corollary to the first . " What is the meaning of the word maximum ? How can we know that this maximum is reached . . . ? " The answer follows at once from the introduction of the reversible cycle , namely that " the necessary condition of the maximum is that  | in bodies used to obtain the motive power of heat , no change of temperature occurs which is not due to a change in volume " . While Carnot was assuming that to deny the loss of heat as such during the reversible production of work " would overthrow the whole theory of heat of which it is the foundation " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invigorating atmosphere of his father 's Manchester brewery . He was , to be sure , only six years old when Carnot 's memoir was published , but his concern for the utilisation of physical " forces " began at so early an age that his first publication on this subject was accepted by the Royal Society when he was only twenty-two . This first paper was concerned with the relation between heat and electricity . In it he shows that the heat obtainable from the electric current produced by dissolving a known weight of zinc in a Daniell cell is approximately equal to the heat obtainable by dissolving the same weight of zinc in sulphuric acid . This was a most ingenious extension of the problem considered by Rumford and Carnotfar too ingenious for his contemporaries who remained quite unmoved . Obtuse as were the British men of science , it is some comfort to know that the Germans were even worse ; for the first philosophical attempt to clarify the confusion surrounding the various " forces " was actually refused by the editor of Poggendorf 's Annalen . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the author was requested not to send any more . The author was Robert Mayer , whose thoughts were turned to the subject owing to the unexpectedly good health enjoyed by the ship 's company to whom he was appointed as physician . The enforced leisure compelled him to face the question " What do we understand by forces ' " ? And how are different forces related to each other ? His answer , though not free from the metaphysical obscurity which D'Alembert had been at pains to remove , and vitiated by the retention of the word " force " when Young 's term " energy " would have made the distinction clearer , at any rate pointed to the paramount necessity of asking the question and of the possibility of fruitfully applying Footnote  | the answer to the case of the relation between work and heat . His analogies were also most suggestive , as when he compares a train to a " distilling apparatus ; the heat applied under the boiler passes off as motion and this is deposited again as heat at the axles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ratio of work done to heat produced , on the incompletely verified assumption that no heat is lost or gained when the volume of a gas changes without the performance of external work . Mayer 's far greater compatriot Helmholtz shared with him the distinction of being rejected by Poggendorf . In his great memoir , The Conservation of Force , published by the Physical Society of Berlin in 1847 , Helmholtz set forth the first generalised account of the modern principle of the conservation of energy . The introduction at least should be read by every student of physics . Critical physics has of course progressed far beyond Helmholtz , but uncritical physics , of which there is still a great deal , is a generation behind him . The only weakness in the memoir is that , despite the derivation of the well-known energy equation , which led to the use of Zmv2 for the vis-viva , the term " Force " is used far too loosely . The memoir of the Danish physicist , Colding , published also in 1842 , was likewise without influence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so apathetic Mayer , Joule , and Helmholtz continued the struggle to convince their contemporaries of the quantitative equivalence of heat and work , and this in spite of the absence of any adequate experimental basis . For though Joule 's later results were of an unparalleled exactitude , his earlier results varied between 700 and 1000 ft. - lbs. per B.Th.U . The establishment of the modern dynamical theory of heat thus repeats the history of the earlier atomic theory ; both provide convincing evidence of the driving power of scientific faith which is able to remove mountains of experimental inconsistencies . To this faith Joule testified in the statement that he was " satisfied that the grand agencies of nature are by the Creator 's fiat indestructible ; and that whatever mechanical force is expended , an exact equivalent of heat is always obtained . " At this time ( 1843 ) Joule evidently did not realise the implications of Carnot 's discoveries ? if indeed he had ever heard of them ? for  | he summarised the results of his experiments to determine the ratio of the " force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat generated in the words : " the quantity of heat capable of increasing the temperature of a pound of water by one degree of Fahrenheit 's scale is equal to , and may be converted into , a mechanical force capable of raising 838 lbs . to the perpendicular height of one foot . " It will not be necessary to examine Joule 's work on the mechanical equivalent in detail ; it belongs rather to the history of technique and in any case has been admirably set out in easily accessible memoirs . It will be sufficient to emphasise that Joule 's views on the interconvertibility of natural forces equalled Mayer 's in comprehensiveness ; and he added to this speculative insight an equal comprehensiveness of experimental methods , such as were suggested by the march of mechanical engineering among whose latest triumphs he found his vocation . To the electrochemical , magneto-electric , and the better known purely mechanical ( paddle wheel ) experiments , he added one in which the heat generated by driving water through capillaries was measured . And he repeated with greater precision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permissible experimental errors , that no heat is lost or gained when an expanding gas compresses itself so that the mean pressure throughout the apparatus remains constant . This unambiguous demonstration of the precise relation between " destroyed " work ( friction ) and heat production sealed the fate of caloric and enabled Clausius to correct the error in Carnot 's principle . Great as were the contributions of Joule and Carnot , Clausius seems to stand out as the key figure in this great revolution in thought . Starting his career at the age of twenty-eight as Professor of Physics at the Royal Artillery and Engineering School in Berlin , he occupied chairs at Zurich , Wurzburg , and Bonn . His attitude to the problem is clearly shown by the title and introduction of his great memoir ( 185o ) Ueber die bewegende Kraft der Warme ( ( ) n the Motive Power of Heat ) : " Since heat was first used as a motive power in the steam engine , thereby suggesting from practice that a certain quantity of work may be treated as equiva-  | lent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural to assume also in theory a definite relation between a quantity of heat and the work which in any possible way can be produced by it . . . " How was this relation to be sought ? After paying tribute to Carnot and Clapeyron , who had translated Carnot 's verbal analysis into symbolic form based on the indicator diagram familiar to engineers , he criticised their assumptions that the quantity of heat , being a substance , remains unchanged . The results of Joule on the contrary seemed to prove that the quantity of heat produced by friction is proportional to the mechanical work done . These facts and others " support the view that heat is not a substance but consists in the motion of the least parts of bodies " . If this view is correct , it is admissible to apply to heat the general mechanical principle that a motion may be transformed into work , and in such a manner that the loss of vis-viva is proportional to the work accomplished . These facts " almost compel us to accept the equivalence between heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work requires not only a change in the distribution of heat , but also an actual consumption of heat " ( italics mine ) . When this change has been made then the Clapeyron diagram shows how the amount of work obtainable in a perfect engine depends only on the temperature relations of cylinder and condenser ; and the amount of work so obtained is in fact equivalent to the amount of heat " lost " . This result amounts to a law of nature additional to that of Joule . The latter , the first law of thermodynamics , asserts that whenever a conversion of heat into work or vice-versa occurs , the quantities bear a constant relation to one another ; the former ? called the second law of thermodynamics ? asserts the conditions under which the maximum conversion of heat into work may take place . Clausius drew from the second law a corollary which has been used and abused with great vigour by all sorts and conditions of men desirous of proving both that the universe was and was not created in time ? an example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The corollary itself , regarded as a physical principle is unexceptionable and has valuable applications to such apparently remote problems as the forecasting of the movements of depressions . For a reversible transfer of heat  | Carnot had shown that ( Q1-Q2 ) /Q1= ( T1-T2 ) /T1 , which may be written in the form Q2/Q1=T2/Tl or Q2/T2=Q1/T1 . In other words in a reversible process the function Q/T undergoes no change . To this function Clausius gave the name " entropy " . In the vast majority of processes that are going on around us however it happens that a quantity of heat passes from a body at one temperature to a body at a lower temperature , without the performance of any work . The gain of entropy of the body receiving the heat is bound to be greater than the loss of entropy of the body losing heat ; therefore the entropy of the whole system , as Clausius said , tends to a maximum . A physical interpretation of this will appear after we have studied the kinetic theory . While Clausius was engaged on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been quite unconsciously dogging his steps . Like Clausius he had read Clapeyron 's ingenious development of Carnot 's principle and , while engaged on that reprehensible habit of nosing round the second-hand bookstalls in Paris , came upon a copy of the almost entirely neglected original memoir of Carnot . He was intrigued with the great possibilities of this little work ? too intrigued , as it turned out ? for he failed to recognise the error in it . Thomson , as his ultimate career proved , had the mind of a precision engineer ; among the chief of his services to science was the great triumph of the successful laying of the Atlantic cable , the invention of a reliable mariner 's compass , and the complete overhaul and establishment of accurate and reproducible standards of measurement in electricity . But at this time the subject of heat claimed his interest ; and he must soon have realised that the further progress of that branch of science must be seriously hampered by the absence of any but empirical standards of temperature , in which the unit was perforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f ' it be argued that the same was then true of the whole of dynamics , since the units of mass , length , and time were similarly bound to material standards , it must be admitted that this was indeed the case , but that , as subsequent investigations have shown , the uncertainty involved is of the order of the reciprocal of the velocity of light and therefore of no significance on the terrestrial scale . Fortunately the robust euclidean materialists of  | the Victorian age were quite unconscious of any such arbitrariness in the fundamental units . Thomson had the best possible preparation for an investigation of this kind ? a year under the rigorous discipline of Regnault 's laboratory . This great physicist had shown that the gas thermometer was as near a perfect instrument as human wit was likely to devise ; but Thomson recognised that even so " the scale actually adopted is an arbitrary series of numbered points of reference sufficiently close for the requirements of practical thermometry " ( italics his ) . What was wanted was an absolute scale , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a unit of heat descending from a body A at a temperature T ? of the scale , to a body B at a temperature ( T ? I ) ? , would give out the same mechanical effect , whatever be the number T. This may justly be termed an absolute scale , since its characteristic is quite independent of the physical properties of any specific substance . " In his first exposition ( 1848 ) of this proposed scale Thomson had no qualms about Carnot 's belief in the indestructibility , of heat ? " the conversion of heat ( or caloric ) into mechanical effect is probably impossible , certainly undiscovered " ? consequently the first scale worked out by Steele under his supervision departed far from the gas scale . This is all the more surprising seeing that he was one of the few British physicists who showed any interest in the work of Joule , with whom he had been in correspondence before the publication of this scale . In 1851 however he had made the great renunciation and published what is commonly regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamics ? and it is to be noticed that in it he fully admitted Clausius ' priority in the establishment of the second law . The new absolute scale being re-calculated on the basis of the corrected Carnot function was found to depart but little from the nitrogen gas thermometer used at ordinary temperatures . We can only refer in passing to the fact that it was to test this correspondence that Joule and Thomson carried out the well-known experiment on the elasticity of real gases , whose result exerted so profound an effect on the attempts then being made to reduce these gases to the liquid state . The scale is commonly known as the " Kelvin " scale , Thomson being ultimately raised to the peerage as Baron Kelvin of Largs .  | Henceforth the ghost of caloric ceased to haunt scientific laboratories and to pervert the minds of even such vigorous innovators as Kelvin . The established interconversion of heat and work in strict numerical proportion was the foundation of all further studies of the " go " of things . But the task , even in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsolved the problem of the actual nature of heat , and of the absence of a complete reciprocity between heat and work . Both speculations , such as those of Bernoulli and Davy , even when backed as in the former case by mathematical argument , seem to have been ignored or regarded as aberrations . The boldest and most comprehensive of all was submitted in 1845 to the Royal Society , and after a careful and conscientious examination by two referees was filed in the archives as being according to one of them " mere nonsence " , and by both considered unworthy of the time it would take to read . The paper On the physics of media that are composed of free and elastic molecules in a state of motion was disinterred by Lord Rayleigh in 1892 and published with a sympathetic and generous tribute . The author , J. J. Waterston , had however by now passed on to a realm where priorities of publication presumably mean little . Waterston 's approach to the problem marked a notable advance on that of Bernoulli and Herapath in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas is measured by the mean kinetic energy of the particles , since all facts of experience point to the necessity for postulating the existence of unequal velocities among the particles . On this assumption and that of the perfect elasticity of the particles he was able , by the application of the classical laws of motion of Galileo and Newton , to derive Boyle 's law , Charles ' law , and the then recently discovered diffusion law due to Graham . Twelve years later a paper on very similar lines by Joule , which had already appeared in outline in another journal some years earlier , was published in the Philosophical Magazine . It would be interesting to know what Waterston 's referees thought when Joule 's " nonsense " was published . Joule went a little further than Waterston and made the first calculation ( ) 1 ' the velocity of a molecule at a particular temperature . On the other hand he does not make it clear that the assumption of  | uniform and constant velocity is a simplification which is unlikely to be true . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title , published his famous memoir Ueber die Art der Bewegung , welche wir Wdrme nennen ? a declaration of faith that the random and ceaseless rush of the molecules is not the cause of heat but is heat . He covered the same ground as had Waterston and Joule , but he realised , as they had not , the importance of the exceedingly small distance traversed by a molecule between " collisions " . In the year 186o , then , a most interesting problem had been clearly posited . Its investigation had produced most promising results , but the principal concept involved ? the kinetic energy of the molecules of a gas ? could not be expressed without ambiguity . Waterston had realised the necessity for admitting the existence of a great number of velocities in a mass of gas under any given conditions , and had therefore expressed his result as functions of the mean velocity . Joule had tacitly , and Clausius overtly , assumed that the velocities were all the same . Now it might be thought that the velocity of hydrogen calculated by Joule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mean velocity as postulated by Waterston . But the question at once arises " What mean ? " For the calculation involves the equation c2 = 3 pv/mn where c is the " velocity " ; that is the square root of the arithmetic mean of the sum of the squares of all the separate velocities ? a quantity which is demonstrably not equal to their simple arithmetic mean . The problem was to show that this " root mean square " function followed from postulates involving no assumptions other than those of Newtonian dynamics . But the method of carrying it out involved the application of the technique hitherto restricted to the solution of problems in games of chance ( Pascal ) ; in randolt observations of physical quantities ( Gauss , Laplace , and Poisson , who together founded the mathematical theory of probability , i.e. the probability of a particular value of a given quantity lying between given limits ) ; and human mass characteristics ( Quetelet ) . To apply this to a problem in particle dynamics demanded a " new star of the first magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already risen James Clerk Maxwell . Maxwell was not altogether unprepared ; he had just been  | awarded the Adams Prize for an essay on the nature of Saturn 's rings , in which he had proved that the apparent stability of these rotating objects was possible only if they.consisted of a swarm of separate particles . He approached the problem of the distribution of the velocities of a swarm of particles of a gas in a purely formal manner ? a manner which was characteristic of all his work and which disconcerted those who regarded physical " models " as not only essential to fertile thought , as did also Maxwell himself , but as , either " right " or " wrong " , which he did not . " In order to lay the foundations of such investigations on strict mechanical principles I shall demonstrate the laws of motion of an indefinite number of small , hard , and perfectly elastic spheres acting on one another only on impact . If the properties of such a system of bodies are found to correspond to those of gases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to more knowledge of the properties of matter . " The molecules in this case are to be regarded as Newtonian particles whose gravitational properties are negligible compared with their elasticity . But " instead of saying that the particles are hard , spherical and elastic , we may if we please say that the particles are centres of force , of which the action is insensible except at a certain small distance , when it suddenly appears as a repulsive force of very great intensity . It is evident that either assumption will lead to the same results . " This alternative assumption was not original . First systematically developed by Boscovitch in 1745 and 1759 , it had greatly influenced many physicists . What is original is that Maxwell does not appear to be interested in the question as to which assumption is " true " . For the problem in hand it suffices to discover whether the deduced consequences of the formal postulates fit the known facts ; if so , we can proceed to deduce further as yet unknown " facts " , that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining of further knowledge which might never have been suspected in its absence . The mathematical problem is " to find the average number of particles whose velocities lie between given limits , after a great number of collisions among a great number of particles " . By rigorous mechanical argument  | Maxwell discovered that " the velocities are distributed among the particles according to the same law as the errors are distributed among the observations in the theory of the method of least squares ' . " Thus no matter what change a gas is made to undergo , the velocities of the " particles " composing it will ultimately reach a steady distribution , though the velocities of individuals are constantly altering , and further that the mean kinetic energy is proportional to the ( square ) of the " root mean square " velocity . Unfortunately Maxwell 's first proof ( 1859 ) of this result depended on the solution of a " functional equation " in which the three velocity components of any molecule were assumed to be independent . With this capital achievement as a starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new knowledge of gases into which we can not enter , suffice it to mention one example of the " unsuspected " mentioned above , namely viscosity . Maxwell showed that viscosity , like other properties which are , so to speak , " transported " across a space by the opposed flow of two streams of molecules endowed with some determining factor ( in this case linear momentum ) to different degrees , is proportional to both the number of molecules in unit volume and their mean free path . But these two quantities are inversely proportional to one another . Hence change of pressure , which at constant temperature depends only on the former quantity , will not affect the viscosity ? a hardly credible forecast , but one quickly verified by experiment . We must here introduce another great figure who worked in friendly rivalry ? the Viennese physicist , Boltzmann . Both he and Maxwell independently attacked the problem of the partition of energy between the various possible motions of a body . The special interest of this problem was the possibility of its bearing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an entity could possess no kinetic energy save in respect of simple translatory motion . Both Maxwell and Boltzmann discovered that , in the more general case of a rigid body , the ratio of translational to other ( e.g. rotational ) energy must be constant and equal to unity ? the so-called equipartition law . Boltzmann also gave a method of expressing the partition in terms of the number of " degrees of freedom " of the molecule , that is the  | number of co-ordinates necessary to determine the energy-state of a body ? three for a " point " , six for a rigid body . It was easy to show , following a suggestion of Clausius , that the ratio of the specific heats of a gas , measured at constant pressure and constant volume respectively , would equal 1 + 2/n . Attempts to verify this completely failed : no gas gave a value of 1.67 corresponding to n = 3 , and the majority of gases gave 1.4o corresponding to n =5 . It must be remembered that all this was going on only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of the distinction between atoms and molecules of elementary gases , and many years before the use of Kundt and Warburg 's method for measuring specific heats for such gases as mercury . The equipartition law was for the time being saved by Boltzmann 's suggestion that the molecules of the simpler elementary gases might be conceived as a pair of " points " rigidly connected by a single axis ? one of the six degrees of freedom would thus vanish . At the end of the century verification came dramatically with the discovery of five gases whose atoms were so inert as to be unable to combine even with their own atoms , and all have a specific heat ratio of 1.67 . Boltzmann carried the analysis of the distribution law much further than had Maxwell , but even he made the assumption of " molecular chaos " ? an expression implying that the mode of choice of a statistical group of molecules has no influence on the distribution . We now have to enquire how the kinetic theory of gases was related to the " go " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the " unilateral " conversion of mechanical work into heat . To the solution of the first problem the botanist , Robert Brown , had in 1828 furnished a clue , when he observed the ceaseless random motion of dead pollen grains suspended in liquid and free from any external disturbance , such as draughts or convection currents . At first he thought he had discovered the " primitive molecules " constituent of living things ; but after having observed the same motion in particles of inorganic origin he concluded that the " primitive molecules " must be common to all matter . I t is doubtful to what extent Brown realised the nature of the phenomenon he had observed ; the modern explanation ? that the  | particles are driven hither and thither by the unbalanced impacts of much smaller particles ? was given by Delsaux in 1877 , and fairly accurate measurements of the mean displacements were made by Gouy in 1888 . It was Einstein however who , in a classical series of papers dating from 1905 , proved that " according to molecular kinetic theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liquid will perform movements of such magnitude that they can be easily observed in a microscope on account of the molecular motion of heat " . It must be understood that this prophesy was based on exact calculations , and was entirely independent of the already observed " Brownian movement " of which Einstein had heard such vague accounts as to raise doubts in his mind as to whether it was really the same thing . Moreover , he went further , and actually calculated the size of the molecules . By 1914 Perrin and his associates in Paris had verified this prediction , and made an estimate of the number of molecules in a cubic centimetre ? a quantity soon to be confirmed by many independent methods , thus giving to the molecule a physical reality in spite of the impossibility of its ever being seen . Maxwell himself supplied a philosophic answer to the second question . Useful work may be regarded as the proportion of ordered motion available in a disorderly crowd of particles . Similarly " heat " can not flow from a " cold " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole the kinetic energy of the former is less than that of the latter , hence there are fewer fast moving molecules in the former , therefore on the whole fast moving molecules will tend to move from the hotter to the colder body . But , said Maxwell , an intelligent demon might operate a trap door in such a way as to allow only the relatively fast molecules to move into the hot gas , and an equivalent number of relatively slow ones to move into the cold . The change of mean kinetic energy , that is " heat " , would then ' be from cold to hot . The device of the " sorting demon " thus reveals that the second law of thermodynamics is a purely statistical law , that is , it applies only to the average behaviour of large numbers . There is nothing dynamically impossible in the passage of heat from a cold mass to a relatively hotter one ? it is merely vastly less probable than that a pack of  | cards by continual shuffling should ultimately resume the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So much for the " go " of things in general . But there is a special " go " which has from the earliest times been recognised as " different " ; this is chemical " affinity " ? a word said to have been used first in this sense by Albertus Magnus . The chequered history of chemical affinity is but another example of failure to distinguish between quantity and intensity ? made peculiarly difficult in this case seeing that quantity may in certain circumstances modify intensity . So long as alchemy ruled the day , the " go " of a chemical process was conceived solely in terms of intensity ? the philosopher 's stone being as it were pure intensity , which , as Bacon remarked , was to turn a " sea of quicksilver into gold " . Despite his inability to rid himself entirely of the alchemical miasma , Boyle on the other hand said , " I have long thought that in divers cases the quantity of a menstruum may much more considerably compensate its want of strength than chemists are commonly aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their adherents , an " affinity table " being constructed by Geoffroy ( 1718 ) and given greater precision by Bergman ( 1775 ) and Beaume ( 1773 ) ; Wenzel on the other hand pointing out that concentration could not be neglected in the order of affinities ( 1777 ) . It was however above all Berthollet who , in his Essai de Statique Chimique ( p. 229 ) , returned to Boyle 's hint and illustrated it by many examples . Berzelius recognised that Berthollet had confused the possibility of influencing the course and amount of chemical reaction with the composition of the product . This judicious reminder prevented Berthollet 's work being entirely lost sight of , and as a result chiefly of the work of Wilhelmy ( 185o ) on the slow , virtually irreversible , hydrolysis of cane sugar , and of Berthelot and St. Gilles ( 1862-3 ) on the reversible action between alcohol and acids , Guldberg and Waage were able to enunciate in 1864 the law of Mass Action , which is one of the foundation stones of physical chemistry . The essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical reaction proceeds is , at constant temperature , proportional to the product of the active masses of the constituents . If the products are capable of mutual interaction , the same  | will be true of this action also . Hence an equilibrium mixture will ultimately result . The constants of proportion of the two actions will in general be different from one another , hence the equilibrium may rest on either side of mere equality . Any other condition , such as the nature of neighbouring surfaces , which affects the rate will in general affect both rates to the same extent ; hence the equilibrium state , though established more or less quickly , will be unaltered . The definition of active mass ? at first regarded as the number of molecules per unit volume ? has turned out to be something of a much more subtle kind ; the interpretation of the word " active " has been the business of much recent research . It now remains to be shown why an idea , superficially purely chemical , has been introduced at the end of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies in the restriction placed on the law of mass action , namely that it is not necessarily true except at constant temperature . The explanation of this is easily seen by reference to the second law of thermodynamics : if the reaction is accompanied by any heat change , addition of heat must favour the action normally proceeding with the absorption of heat ( endothermic ) , otherwise it would be possible to extract an unlimited amount of heat from the reaction ( Le Chatelier , 1888 , a special case of which is Lenz 's law , p. 301 ) . Thus the equilibrium point would be shifted . Now the constant in the law of mass action ( the ratio of the two velocity constants referred to above ) is a quantitative measure of the " affinity " of the reaction , hence this affinity must be influenced by the heat relations of the reaction . At first Berthelot and , independently , Thomson taught that the total heat evolved or absorbed by equivalent quantities of reactants gives a direct measure of the affinity . It was Helmholtz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointed out that not the change in total energy but free energy is the true measure of affinity , the change in free energy being defined ' as the equivalent of the work done when the system changes at constant temperature , and also reversibly , so that no internal dissipation occurs . The reason Footnote  | why the " free " energy is in general different from the total heat exchange of the reactants is that the process may involve transfer of heat to or from the surroundings . But this has nothing to do with the work the system may be able to do . This was in 1882 ; five years later with the publication of the first number of the Zeitschrift fur Physikalische Chemie , physical chemistry celebrated its birth as a separate discipline . This was a fitting culmination of a crowded decade ; for during those fateful years that versatile genius , Va n't Hoff , had effected the great generalisation whereby not only equilibria between chemical reactants but also the equilibrium between a solution and its pure solvent ( osmotic pressure ) were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this form was none other than that of the formulation of the second law of thermodynamics established by Clapeyron and Clausius ( p. 282 ) . The number of the Zeitschrift , in which appeared Va n't Hoff 's generalisation of the empirical laws of Raoult for solutions , contained also the explanation of the apparent anomalies presented by electrolytes . This explanation , due to Arrhenius , was of course the theory that electrolytes contain a proportion of the molecules of the solute in the form of charged particles called " ions " . This at once provided the basis for an extension of the thermodynamic laws ? now because of their generalisation better known as the laws of energetics ? to the elucidation of the electromotive force developed between electrodes and electrolytes . Once again Helmholtz ( and later Nernst ) was the leader . Behind all this feverish activity was Wilhelm Ostwald . No one more than he realised the importance of this young branch of chemistry in which the form of the energy relationship was studied in abstraction from the properties of individual chemical substances . Skilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in publicity , he smoothed the path for the marriage of science to industry in Germany ? a union fruitful in the vast range of amenities which distinguishes our age , but creator also of the colossal resources without which the world catastrophes of 1914 and 1939 could never have occurred . Meanwhile there was living in respected obscurity in the University of Yale a man whose name is mentioned with rever-  | ence in every book of the history of science and in every text book on physical chemistry . But apart from stating the fact that he discovered a principle of great importance called the " phase rule " and expressed it in terms which hardly any of his contemporaries could understand , these books are content to allow Josiah Gibbs to remain a Great Name . This is a pity ; since although the reading of Gibbs ' original memoirs demands mathematical facility of a fairly high order , the direction of thought can be followed with great profit by anyone capable of grasping the simple outline of thermodynamics given in this chapter . It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation between pressure and volume of a mass of steam in a cylinder that Carnot 's principle was put in a form from which many unsuspected results could be drawn by mathematical manipulation . Gibbs ' first contribution to knowledge was to show that far wider consequences could be drawn from curves showing the relation between volume and entropy . Though , as he himself pointed out , " the use of a method involving the notion of entropy , the very existence of which depends upon the second law of thermodynamics will doubtless seem to many far fetched . . . This inconvenience is perhaps more than counterbalanced by the advantages of a method which makes the second law of thermodynamics so prominent . " His great powers of geometrical imagery enabled him to introduce a third variable , energy , whereby thermodynamical surfaces instead of curves were generated . By the analytical manipulation of these surfaces Gibbs was able to break entirely new ground in the application of thermodynamics . The nature of this novelty is put very well by Mr. J. G. Crowther ( Famous American Men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thermodynamics " , he writes , " . . . were not interested in the private life of the steam , the internal relations between its different portions . They assumed the states were the same all through . The problem before a chemist is quite different . He is interested primarily in the actions inside a flask , not in the work that can be got out of steam inside a cylinder . " In other words , whereas the engineer is concerned with the energetic changes of a changeless substance , the chemist seeks to  | interpret and foretell what changes may occur in a substance consequent on its change in energy . To this problem Gibbs addressed himself in his most famous memoir On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances ( 1875-8 ) , in which he showed that " as in the case of simply mechanical systems . . . which are capable of only one kind of action upon external systems , viz. the performance of external work , the function which expresses the capability of the system for this kind of action also plays the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equilibrium being that the variation of this function shall vanish ; so in a thermodynamic system ( such as all material systems actually are ) which is capable of two different kinds of action upon external systems , the two functions which express the twofold capabilities of the system afford an almost equally simple criterion of equilibrium " . The two functions are energy ( whose variation determines the possible total heat exchange ) and entropy ( whose variation determines the possible performance of work ) . The criteria for equilibrium are that for any possible change in the system ( e.g. change of state , degree of solution ) which leaves its energy unchanged , its entropy must either remain the same or decrease . The reader should compare this with Kelvin 's enunciation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics ; Gibbs ' criteria are a generalisation of this law of the conditions of heat transfer . This powerful generalisation was made applicable to " all material systems " by the brilliant device of introducing the masses of the constituents of the system as variables . This was effected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituent known as its potential , which was defined as the differential coefficient Of the energy with respect to the mass introduced or withdrawn from the system . ' It thus gives a measure of the " intensity " of the substance corresponding to the " intensity " of heat which we call temperature . The " Phase Rule " , alluded to above , was but one of the deductions from the analytical exploration of these criteria of equilibrium . Maxwell was for a long time alone among British men of science to realise that the memoir on Heterogeneous Equilibrium was as important for chemistry as for physics . One reason is that it demolished at one blow the already crumbling wall that Footnote  | divided these sciences . A few years after the publication of the law of mass action , Deville and Debray showed that in the chemical dissociation of calcium carbonate into lime and carbon dioxide , the pressure of gas produced depends only on the temperature and not on the quantities of the substances present . This apparent exception to the law of mass action is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being due to the fact that the active mass of a solid is not the mere mass ; it is related to its " potential " . In recent years a whole host of apparent anomalies in physical chemistry has been elucidated by recourse to this conception or to some modification of it . No one has played a more prominent part in this work of clarification than G. N. Lewis . Gibbs had drawn attention to the fact that in every change there is a " tendency to expell " one of the components from one phase to another : water for instance is " expelled " from the solid to the liquid phase in equilibrium with it when a skater passes over a sheet of ice not too far removed from the normal freezing point . To this concept Lewis gave the name " escaping tendency " . Equilibrium is the state of affairs when the escaping tendencies of two phases are equal ; so osmotic pressure is simply the pressure necessary to equalise the escaping tendencies of the solvent in the solution and in the pure state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vapour pressure corrected for any divergence from the laws of the ideal gas . In such form it is known as the " fugacity " . The " activity " of a substance taking part in any physico-chemical action may then be defined as the ratio of its fugacity under the given conditions to the fugacity at some standard state , whence it follows that the activity will be unity at the standard state . By means of this formal coefficient the behaviour of the most diverse equilibria ? osmotic , ionic , chemical ? can be described in terms of the classical laws which are " true " only for " ideal " states . Although treated as an amiable eccentric by his colleagues , Gibbs must be numbered among the greatest and most influential of human intellects . He never made an experiment ; it can hardly be said that he made any completely original discovery . But he extracted riches from mines already well worked . It may be that his last work , Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics ( 1901 ) ,  | which does not seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest to an original creation . Here he showed how to determine the most general mechanical relationships ( which , since they involved an indefinitely large number of " degrees of freedom " , were necessarily statistical ) from which the statistical thermodynamics of Maxwell and Boltzmann could be deduced as special cases . This achievement was made possible by his creation ( 188o ) of a special type of vector algebra , in which he drew upon the " multiple algebra " of Hamilton and more particularly Grassmann ? the latter 's being a wonderful generalisation for dealing with manifolds of points ordered in any number of dimensions . Gibbs ' sole recorded speech to the Faculty of Yale closed a discussion of the relative importance of mathematics and language with the words : " Mathematics is a language . " No one knew better than he how to make it speak with the tongues of angels . Footnote  | THE PARTICULAR " GO " - FROM PARTICLES TO FIELDS THE year i 86o ? in which Maxwell 's proof of the distribution law of molecular velocities was published ? may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the work that can be got out of any mechanical system depends in the last resort on its kinetic energy or its potentiality for acquiring kinetic energy ? to mark which a concept called " potential energy " was introduced . Further , that the heat content of any body is no other than the sum total of the kinetic energies of its constituent molecules , from which however useful work can be gained only in so far as these molecules are prevented from increasing the random motion of those of another body . This , and the many consequences both for physics and chemistry which could be deduced from it , was a great achievement . For one thing it could be applied with equal cogency to electrical phenomena ; for , as Joule had shown , the mechanical equivalent of heat was the same whether the heat was produced by " degrading " electricity direct in a conductor or indirectly by means of a motor and paddle wheel . The latter method was used with great precision by Rowland . Sound offered no difficulties ; Joule with characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sound from his paddle wheels . But light , and radiation generally , although , like sound , propagated with finite velocity , remained outside this otherwise all-embracing scheme . It is true that many mathematical physicists were taxing their own ingenuity and other people 's credulity in devising mechanical " models " of an oscillatory character to account for light , which would consequently involve something equivalent to energy in the undulating medium ; but that is as far as anyone could go . In  | 1865 however the situation was transformed with dramatic suddenness , and in a most unexpected fashion , by the publication of Maxwell 's paper , A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field . There was no attempt to account for radiation ; Maxwell 's object was to discover a theory which would account more consistently and more convincingly for the forces of attraction and repulsion between magnetised and electrified bodies than would the existing theory of Weber and Neumann . This latter theory assumed that the forces were due to particles either stationary or in relative motion , capable of acting on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Newtonian gravitational conception to the new " forces " of magnetism and electricity . Maxwell however " preferred to seek an explanation of the facts in another direction , by supposing them to be produced by actions which go on in the surrounding medium as well as in the excited bodies , . . . " ( italics mine ) . Now this is just what the undulatory theory did to explain light . When therefore we speak of the electromagnetic theory of light as a consequence of Maxwell 's procedure , we should remember that it is not so much that light has been deduced from electricity and magnetism as that electric and magnetic phenomena are explained as special characteristics of a medium , or at any rate of a . field ; which is precisely the concept found to be essential for the explanation of certain properties ? interference and polarisation ? of light . This revolutionary shift of emphasis from particle to field was not originated by Maxwell but borrowed ? with the most respectIul acknowledgments ? from one who had played no part in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrodynamics ? Michael Faraday . Faraday was debarred from joining in the hub-bub for the sufficient reason that he knew no mathematics : in the eight hundred odd pages of his Experimental Researches there is not a single mathematical formula . Yet , as the late Sir J. J. Thomson remarked , " he showed by the way he handled his conception of the lines of force that he was a born geometer . " Faraday once said that he had n't time to make money ; presumably he had n't time to learn mathematics ; he was , like Bach , too busy using them ready made . While the continental mathematicians were laying down more and more elegant roads p 300 in the wrong direction , Faraday passed his time exploring the country to find the right direction . His explorations , the careful description of which fill two large volumes , brought him a view of many of the secrets of nature , but two above all compelled him to regard the space ( see later , p. 302 ) surrounding a magnetised or electrified body as altered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposing it traversed by actual lines of force having the characteristics of tension and mutual repulsion whereby they may , unlike those of the gravitational field as pictured by Newton , follow curved paths . These discoveries were specific inductive capacity and electromagnetic induction . It will repay us to take a swift view of these well-known phenomena . The discovery of electromagnetic induction was the result of Faraday 's conviction , amounting almost to an obsession , that natural phenomena are complementary ? a kind of generalised law of action and reaction ? and also to his skilful use of analogy . Now it was well known that static electric charges are always accompanied by induced charges on bodies in their neighbourhood , and that every current is accompanied by a magnetic field . Surely then it should be possible to detect an electric current induced by a current flowing in a neighbouring conductor , and also a current in a conductor in the neighbourhood of a magnetic field ? Unfortunately Faraday was met at the outset by an unexpected difficulty . It will be remembered that a magnetic field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the current is steady or not . It was reasonable to expect a similar result when seeking an induced current ; but no matter how strong the current , how long or intimately wound together the conductors , how thorough the insulation of the two circuits from one another , not a sign of an induced current was to be seen . It is however the privilege of genius to allow faith to ignore facts ; Faraday knew that there must be an effect . He used a battery with ten times the number of plates previously employed , and " when the contact was made , there was a sudden and very slight effect at the galvanometer , and there was also a similar slight effect when the contact with the battery was broken " ; moreover the movement of the needle at " break " was in the opposite  | direction to that at " make " .1 But while the current was steady there was no movement at all ? even when the current was strong enough to heat up the helix . It is probable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result when testing the effect of a magnet on a conductor : only when the magnet was moved , so as to change the strength of the field , was any result obtained . His account of these experiments ? the care , the perseverance , the seizing of the essential in the minute effects obtained ? make fascinating reading . In the end he had shown that whenever the magnetic field in the neighbourhood of a conductor is changing , whether by means of a simple or electro-magnet , an electric current tends to flow in the conductor . Moreover he gave an exact description of the direction of flow in relation to the direction and polarity of the field ; but he took near a couple of pages to do it . By regarding it as a special case of electrodynamic action and reaction Lenz was able to condense it into one sentence . The discovery of electromagnetic induction made possible the electric age in which we are now living ? if the sub-atomic age has not yet dawned . But for our immediate purpose its importance lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of " physical lines of magnetic force " . At first he was inclined to t hink that the momentary appearance of a current in a conductor , placed near a current-bearing conductor , was due to the matter of the former being thrown into an abnormal state , which he called " electrotonic " . Later he abandoned this view for one in which the intersection , of the " magnetic curves " surrounding t he current were regarded as the cause . Then came his discovery of specific inductive capacity . It is well known that if a charged body is brought near to one previously known to be uncharged , a charge is induced on the latter for as long as the inducing charge is in the neighbourhood . The question Faraday wished to answer was whether the magnitude of the induced charge depended on the nature of the " dielectric " , Footnote  | or medium ( usually air ) between the two bodies . The contrast between Faraday 's point of view and that of the founders of electricity is shown by the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coulomb , who had shown that a clean wire and one coated with shellac acquired the same induced charge . Faraday 's comment on this was : " Charge depends on induction ; and if induction is related to the particles of the surrounding dielectric , then it is related to all the particles of that dielectric inclosed by the surrounding conductors , and not merely to the few situated next to the charged body . " He is clearly looking for a proof of his growing conviction that electricity , as it were , resides in the medium , and is not , as was then supposed , merely shot through it . In a beautifully contrived electrostatic balance he showed that the balance is at once upset by lowering an insulated sheet of shellac between the inducing charge and either component of the balance . The difficulty of the experiment is due to the rarity of a completely non-conducting material : shellac and sulphur were the substances finally chosen . The result had , of course , the most profound effect on the design of condensers . Faraday 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force was published in 1851 . It is a masterly piece of natural philosophy comparable with the Queries that conclude Newton 's Opticks . In reviewing the various types of " lines of force " by means of which physical phenomena may be more readily comprehended , he contrasts those of gravitation , in which " no effect which sustains the idea of an independent or physical line of force is presented to us " ( he would probably change his mind were he alive to-day ) with those of the sun , in whose case " rays ( which are lines of force ) pass across the intermediate space ; but then we may affect these lines by different media applied to them in their course " ( italics mine ) . The case is similar with static electric charges ( as shown by the phenomena of specific inductive capacity ) and far more evident in the case of the current . But the magnet is the supreme example , since " it presents a system of forces perfect in itself and able therefore to exist by its own mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite poles . The existence of physical lines is  | evidenced by their being commonly curved , and by the fact that when a wire moves through them a current is generated in it . " The mere fact of motion can not have produced this current : there must have been a state or condition around the magnet and sustained by it , within the range of which the wire was placed ; and this state shows the physical constitution of the lines of magnetic force . " In the last paragraph he rises to the heights of the Newton of the General Scholium ? heights from which Maxwell must have viewed the Promised Land : What this state is , or upon what it depends , can not as yet be declared . It may depend upon the aether , as a ray of light does , and an association has already been shown between light and magnetism . . . Whether it of necessity requires matter for its sustentation will depend upon what is understood by the term matter . If that is to be confined to ponderable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical lines of magnetic force any more than to a ray of light or heat ; but if in the assumption of an aether we admit it to be a species of matter , then the lines of force may depend upon some function of it . Experimentally , mere space is magnetic ; but then the idea of such mere space must include that of the aether when one is talking on that belief ; or if thereafter any other conception of the state or condition of space rise up , it must be admitted into the view of that which just now in relation to experiment is called mere space . On the other hand it is I think an established fact , that ponderable matter is not essential to the existence of physical lines of magnetic force . In this great passage he refers to the fact that an association had already been shown between magnetism and light . The experiment had been described in Phil . Trans. for 1846 and was a model of scientific method . In the path of a beam of polarised light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Faraday himself ? a ' tribute to his astounding versatility ) ; the glass itself lay across the lines of force of a powerful electromagnet . By adjusting the eyepiece of the analyser the polarised beam could be extinguished . When however the closing of the circuit energised the magnet , the light immediately became visible ; on opening the circuit it at once disappeared . That this was in fact due to the rotation of the plane of polarisation was shown by rotating the analyser , when the light disappeared ; and the direction of rotation depended on the direction of the magnetic field . This was virtually a proof of the existence of a magnetic factor in light ; but since Faraday had already convinced himself that these  | " two forces electricity and magnetism are convertible into each other in a greater or smaller degree " , it can further be regarded as establishing an electromagnetic factor in light . But it was a hint only ; to prove that light is an electromagnetic disturbance demanded the special type of genius which could deduce the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs to Maxwell alone . To him we therefore return . It was said above ( p. 299 ) that Maxwell was under a great obligation to Faraday for supplying the then revolutionary concept of a field of action in contradistinction to an assemblage of particles . This statement requires two qualifications : first , that on the one hand Faraday never quite rid himself of the preoccupation with chains of polarised particles filling space ? the view being strengthened by his discovery of the laws of electrolysis , which seemed to him to be the expression of an " axis of power " consisting of charged particles ( " ions " , as he was the first to call them ) which were so to speak shot out at the electrodes ; second , that Maxwell was at first very much under the influence of Kelvin . In trying to recreate Maxwell 's thought processes we are fortunate in possessing the many informal letters in which he invited Kelvin 's advice . Though his great memoir did not appear till 1865 , already in 1854 he is asking Thomson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a little insight into the subject " of electricity . The answer was evidently satisfactory , for in the same year he wrote again that in the light of Faraday 's and Kelvin 's " lines of force " he was proposing to attack the problem of reducing the theory of electricity to a dynamical form by " considering magnetic polarisation as a property of a magnetic field or space and developing the geometrical ideas according to this view " . " Polarisation " expresses for him the fact that at a point of space the south pole of a small magnet is attracted in a certain direction with a certain force . He then defines the polarisation of a curve in space as the integral of the polarisation at any point resolved along it , multiplied by the element of the curve . There was nothing strikingly new about this procedure for magnetic forces ; what Maxwell was proposing however was to use this integral as determinative of any electric change iii the field . The first fruits of this new procedure were announced in two  | papers read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these papers he clearly envisaged the task which was to reach complete fruition only ten years later , namely of taking Faraday 's facts , and without any presupposition as to the physical nature of electricity , express them in precise mathematical form , and thence by purely mathematical reasoning deduce some of the wellestablished interactions between electric currents and magnets . The method adopted by Maxwell marks a critical transition in modern physics from an attempt to explain natural phenomena as the results of interactions between units supposed known ( such as the " hard , massy , particles " of Newton , or the " imponderable fluids " of the eighteenth century ) to one in which the form of the relationship only is sought in analogy , the " model " being discarded as soon as its usefulness had been exhausted . The meaning of this will appear more clearly in the sequel . In the paper under review Maxwell recalled Thomson 's comparison of the electric current with the motion of a fluid , not , be it noted , a vaguely conceived " imponderable " fluid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the well-established quantitative mechanical laws involving pressure , energy , velocity , and the like . Precision had been given to this notion by the postulation of an ideal " unit of thought " ? the vortex filament ? the number and distribution of which determine the motion of a closed mass of fluid . The axes of such tubes became for Maxwell the lines of force suggested by Faraday . By recognising the correspondence of velocity to current and difference of fluid pressure to difference of potential , he was able to deduce the properties of steady currents . In , the second part of the paper he extends the analogy to include the case of changing currents ? the changes in the density of the tubes of fluid being used as an expression of Faraday 's " electrotonic state " . Years later this youthful forging of new weapons was replaced by a more detailed " model " of the electromagnetic field . In his paper on physical lines of force ( 1862 ) he supposed the lines of magnetic force to be in rotation about their axes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force along it . From this he was able to deduce the experimental facts of the magnetic field , namely that the pressure due to these rotating  | filaments is proportional to the square of the angular velocity and is accompanied by a tension along their axes ? the very characters assigned by Faraday to his lines of force . Now the value of any hypothesis is its power to embrace phenomena which have not been taken into account in its creation . So far the picture is of a purely magnetic field ; moreover there is a latent contradiction in a system of contiguous rotating tubes , namely that they can not rotate in the same direction . To rectify this Maxwell introduced subsidiary tubes of relatively small diameter , like the idle wheels which maintain gear wheels in motion in the same direction ( Fig. 30 ) . This shift to make the original system work turned out to be its most important part . So long as the " magnetic " tubes rotate with uniform angular velocity , the subsidiary tubes appear to be redundant as constitutive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the angular velocity of contiguous tubes appear and the idle tubes no longer remain idle , but are translated bodily , while rotating , between the magnetic tubes whose axes are fixed . And this is just what happens to the Faraday lines of electric force , which manifest themselves only when the distribution of magnetic force is changing . Moreover there is an even more novel inference . The change in the angular velocity of the magnetic tubes causes a translation of the electric tubes or particles as they may be thought of . Now the distinction between conductors and insulators lies just in this , that in the former the " particles " of electricity are free to move from one molecule of the conductor to the next , but in the latter such movement is resisted . The medium  | thus behaves like an elastic body , yielding until the pressure is balanced by the internal stress ; if the pressure is increased until the stress is overcome ( discharge ) the release of the pressure will set in operation an oscillatory motion , that is the discharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velocity of propagation of this disturbance must necessarily be a function of the electrical properties of the medium . When Maxwell came to make the calculation from the then accepted value of the ratio of the electromagnetic to the electrostatic units of current f ( ( r " empty " space , he found it to be in strikingly close accord with the supposed velocity of light . Here , as the late Sir James Jeans pointed out , Maxwell had just the opposite kind of luck to t hat which may have been one of the factors in deferring Newton 's publication of the law of the moon 's gravity ; for the two quantities which were in such close accord with one another were in fact separately in error by a factor two hundred times as great as the small discrepancy between them . In any case this paper created comparatively little interest ? the ether could not really consist of cog-wheels , so the results deducible from the supposition that it did were hardly to be taken seriously . In 1865 however as has been noted , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field . " The theory I propose may therefore be called a theory of the Electromagnetic Field , because it has to do with the space in the neighbourhood of the electric or magnetic bodies , and it may be i ; tiled a Dynamical Theory because it assumes that in that space there is matter in motion , by which the observed electromagnetic phenomena are produced " ( italics in original ) . Arguing from the recognised transmission of energy in the form of light and heat at an immense speed across vast distances , he supposes that there exists some medium in which energy is thus stored , in part as actual motion , in part as potential energy of elastic deformation . So much had been assumed by many , from Fresnel onwards , though the concept of stored energy had not been fully clarified . But Maxwell 's earlier investigations had given strong evidence for the view that the movements of the same medium would be apprehended by us as the phenomena of magnetism and electricity . In the case of currents the energy is dissipated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium is communicated as the random movement of the molecules of matter ; in the case of insulators there is a displacement or polarisation which represents potential energy , but is without further effect . The charging of an insulator thus involves arrested current flow . Thus then we are led to the conception of a complicated mechanism capable of a vast variety of motion , but at the same time so connected that the motion of one part depends , according to definite relations , on the motion of other parts , these motions being communicated by forces arising from the relative displacement of the connected parts , in virtue of their elasticity . Such a mechanism must be subject to the general laws of Dynamics , and we ought to be able to work out all the consequences of its motion , provided we know the form of the relations between the motions of the parts . The last sentence gives the clue to the nature of Maxwell 's aim and achievement . The " cog wheels " showed that a plausible connexion between magnetism and electricity could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " form of the relations between the motions of the parts " . They have done their job ; so they are not even mentioned . What did Maxwell put in their place ? At first tubes and cells of incompressible fluid ; but even they are not mentioned now . What then ? The answer is nothing . It is here that Maxwell 's method breaks away from tradition . He is not concerned with what electricity " is " ; a distinguished French savant said of his Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism that he understood all of it except what Maxwell meant by a body charged with electricity ! He is not concerned , as another great Frenchman , Henri Poincare , has reminded us , with discovering a mechanical theory of the electromagnetic field , but only with showing that such a theory is possible ; that is that the whole universe of " Matter and Motion " is conformable to one generalised abstract scheme . How was this possible ? To answer this question it will be necessary to make a somewhat lengthy digression on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only implicit , becoming explicit only with Faraday and Maxwell . Two strands of thought must be followed ; one of which , namely the generalisation of mechanics , we have already alluded to ( p. 274 ) , the other being the principle of least action . As far back as the first century of our era we find Hero of Alexandria  | proving that the path taken by a reflected ray of light is the shortest possible . Fermat , seeking to extend this result to the case of refraction , found that the path followed by the ray is ' the one which takes the least time . Leibniz noted that Hero 's " law " is a special case of Fermat 's , namely that in which the velocities of incidence and rebound are equal . Following on this the great mathematicians of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries investigated a number of problems in mechanics of a similar nature , of which the catenary and the brachistochrone may be cited as examples . But all these were isolated problems . More general were what is known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are concerned with the possibility of predicting the behaviour of a system of forces which are so to say interlocked ? in D'Alembert 's principle the interlocking is such as to sustain equilibrium ; in Gauss 's no such restriction is imposed . These principles , valuable as they have proved for the solution of mechanical problems intractable by the classical Newtonian methods , still retained some of the latter 's " earthiness " ? its dependence on geometrical diagrams . At the beginning of Lagrange 's immortal Mecanique Analytique the reader is appraised of the author 's intention to rid mechanics of its dependence on diagrams . The path had been cleared for him by Euler who resolved curvilinear forces into tangential and normal components , and more completely by Maclaurin , in whose Complete , System of Fluxions all forces are resolved along three mutually perpendicular Cartesian axes , whereby the geometrical ( spatial ) characteristics of mechanical problems could be expressed in the form of relations between symbols ( i.e. algebraic equations ) . For dynamical problems Lagrange started from D'Alembert 's principle that when forces are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will undergo accelerations which give a measure of the effective forces ; these accelerations may be written as second order differential equations with respect to the co-ordinates of the masses . But for infinitesimal displacements the impressed forces and the effective forces must be in equilibrium ; and the summation of the product of the force-pairs and the respective displacements is , by the principle of virtual work ( p. 274 ) , zero . This is the fundamental equation of dynamics .  | As such it is of very little use ; it is necessary to find some function which would determine the action of the constraints , which in the fundamental equation has been left completely unspecified . This function was derived from the Principle of Least Action . The ingenious demonstrations of Hero and Fermat , referred to above , were felt to be special cases of a more general principle , namely that Nature works in the most economical manner to achieve her aims . This dogma ? for dogma it is ? derives from the uncritical acceptance of Aristotelian teleology , namely that every natural object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose in view . Aristotle presumably had not time to count the fifty million odd eggs of the Sunfish or the astronomical number of pollen grains from every pine tree . Curiously enough it met less widespread recognition on the physical side , for though Lucretius sang the conservation principles in immortal verse , the theories of alchemy and phlogiston flourished for centuries only by the ignoring or distortion of these principles . From Descartes however came the neo-Aristotelian dogma of the conservation of momentum , from which in all probability came the " metaphysical " confusion which D'Alembert was the first to clear up ( p. 273 ) . It can not be too often emphasised that the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries were the heyday of theology ; so that when Maupertius propounded the Principle of Least Action in 1747 , namely that in any mechanical action the product of mass , velocity , and space traversed is a minimum , his sole reason was that such an economy accorded best with the wisdom of the Creator . It is interesting to note that Euler , who took up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assimilation of purpose and means , for the adoption of a least action principle ; but for his " action " he chose a dynamically well-founded function ? the space integral of the velocity for constant mass . Euler clearly recognised that the principle of least action holds good only for " conservative " systems ( in which politicians may see an omen ) ? systems in which the total energy ( work and vis viva in contemporary terminology ) remains constant . It was in this form that the principle was applied by Lagrange . The problem before Lagrange was to find an expression for any dynamical system such that the actual process , as defined by  | the analytical form of the second law of motion described above , would at the same time be performed with the expenditure of least action . The problem was of a kinds entirely different from those which the mathematicians of the seventeenth century had had to face and for which they had to anticipate the methods of the differential calculus , ultimately codified by Leibniz . There it was merely a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum ( or maximum ) value for the function . Here it is a case of finding a function such that its value under certain stated conditions may be a minimum . The brachistochrone mentioned above provides a convenient example of the nature of the problem ; this problem is to find the path between two points in a vertical plane such that a freely falling body reaches the second point in the least time . Now a path in space referred to given axes can be characterised by an equation , that is , a function of the variables represented by those axes . The problem is therefore to find the function which of all possible functions shall make the time value a minimum , the possible functions being restricted by the well-known function expressing the fact that the vertical rate of fall is itself proportional to the time . This specific problem could be solved by a geometrical method , but the general problem of the variation of functions demanded an entirely new technique invented by Lagrange and called the " calculus of variations " . By means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form where L ( the so-called " Lagrangian function " ) represents the difference between the potential and kinetic energies of the system , Q the external force tending to increase the value of q , which in turn stands for any one of the co-ordinates x , y , z , of Euclidean space . There remained for Lagrange only to point out that the equations were of purely general character , q standing not necessarily for the space co-ordinates , but for any " degrees Footnote  | of freedom " ( i.e. possible changes of any kind , subject to the quantity Q , which likewise need not be a " force " ) . At last we see where this long digression is leading us . Reference to the paragraph quoted on p. 308 from Maxwell 's final paper on the electromagnetic field will make this clear : Lagrange 's equations comprise those " general laws of dynamics " from which Maxwell hoped to work out the behaviour of the field . The original Lagrangian equations had in fact been , put into a more manageable form by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Least Action is so far regarded as the final form that it is now generally known as " Hamilton 's Principle " . The problem was further complicated by the fact that magnetic and electric forces do not act in constant directions . To allow for this Maxwell had to make use of that specialised branch of mathematics , the vector calculus , which had been applied at first by Laplace , and later by Hamilton , to give greater generality to the equations of Lagrange . Consideration of the process by which Maxwell showed that the equations revealing the structure of the electromagnetic field were of precisely the same form as the generalised dynamical equations lies entirely beyond the scope of this book ; all that concerns us is its place in the growth of physical ideas . No one recognised the crisis in physical ideas created by Maxwell better than Poincare . In comparing the methods of one of the " classical " physicists with Maxwell 's , he says : Behind the matter of which our senses are aware and which is made known to us by experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of matter ? the only true matter , in his opinion ? which will no longer have anything but purely geometrical qualities , and the atoms of which will be mathematical points subject to the laws of dynamics alone . And yet he will try and represent to himself by an unconscious contradiction , these invisible and colourless atoms , and therefore try and bring them as close as possible to ordinary matter . Then only will he be thoroughly satisfied , and he , will then imagine that he has penetrated the secret of the universe . Even if the satisfaction is fallacious , it is none the less difficult to give it up . . . Maxwell does not give a mechanical explanation of electricity and magnetism ; he confines himself to showing that such an explanation is possible . . . The same spirit is found throughout all his work . He throws into relief the essential , i.e. what is common to all theories ; everything that suits only a particular theory is passed over almost in silence . The reader therefore finds himself in the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is  | tempted to take as a fugitive and unassailable phantom . But the efforts he is thus compelled to make force him to think , and eventually he sees that there is often something rather artificial in the theoretical " aggregates " which he once admired . Maxwell , perhaps unconsciously , was formulating the modern aim of theoretical physics , which may be broadly expressed as follows : ? Given certain special formal characteristics of the continuum , to discover more general formal characteristics by which the former may be determined . In its latest phase it has reached the logical conclusion which is that of reducing physics to a set of orders of connectedness to whose individual symbols can be assigned no physical meaning . Although this method has achieved startling triumphs ( e.g. in foretelling the discovery of the meson ) Professor Max Born speaks for several of the leading mathmetical physicists in expressing his belief that this must end in self-stultification . Had such a doctrine been universal in i 8go it is doubtful whether the X-ray would ever have been discovered . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said of him as a young man that " although somewhat deficient in analysis , it appeared impossible for him to think wrongly on any physical subject " . It was his power of visualisation of the form of hydrodynamic action which enabled him to visualise the form of connexion between electricity and magnetism . On the other hand he avoided the error of supposing that there need be any pseudo-material fluid to express this form . As the formal characteristics became clearer in his mind , the material trappings , which were at best redundant and at worst contradictory , were shed one by one . In this respect he showed himself superior to Kelvin , from whom he at first " poached " , as he called it , so much . In an age of the triumph of mechanical engineering , Kelvin remained at heart an engineer ; at the flights of Maxwell 's unearthly genius he could and did only regretfully shake his head . Nor was Kelvin alone in this . To most of his contemporaries , especially on the continent , Maxwell 's theory was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of touch with the " realities " of physics . And so it might have remained had not one of its quite unexpected corollaries been the oscillatory nature of electromagnetic action . Light was of course accepted as  | oscillatory ; the velocity of electromagnetic disturbance as calculated by Maxwell turned out to be the same as that of light ? a striking coincidence , but no one had ever met waves having electromagnetic characteristics . How difficult it may be for even the most powerful intellects to break through the crust of tradition is shown by the fact that Kelvin had already in 1853 given a mathematical proof , based on the principle of conservation of energy , that the discharge of a Leyden jar would in certain cases be oscillatory in character . It was moreover from his theory of " electric images " that Maxwell admitted that he intended to " poach " . But Kelvin could not bring himself to take seriously the possibility that the oscillatory discharge might be only , as it were , the outward and visible sign of an oscillatory displacement in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induced his pupil , Heinrich Hertz , to investigate the matter , though rather in the hope that he would be unsuccessful , as Helmholtz had managed to deduce Maxwell 's equations from assumptions which debarred the possibility of the propagation of waves of finite velocity . Hertz first announced the success of his attempts in the Annalen der Physik in 1887 . As a source he had used an induction coil whose secondary circuit was connected to a pair of rods whose capacity was increased by fixing metal spheres to their ends . To detect the presence of oscillatory currents ( " electric waves " ) in the neighbourhood he constructed a wire hoop of such dimensions as would cause it to be " in tune " with the waves , i.e. to constitute a resonator . With a train of sparks passing between the spheres of the radiator , he moved about the room with the detector . At certain positions sparks were clearly seen within the gap ; positions determined by the fact that reflection from the walls of the room was causing the phenomenon well known in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We may marvel at the simplicity of his apparatus and at the certainty of the results ; but within two years , working with waves of ten times the frequency produced by an improved apparatus , he was able to report results of an astonishing precision . Using a parabolic cylindrical reflector to concentrate the primary waves he detected stationary nodes at various points along the wave axis ; with a  | plane sheet of metal placed normally to the axis he demonstrated rectilinear propagation , and then by rotation of the sheet equiangular reflection with polarisation . Finally by interposing a prism of pitch one and a half metres high in the path of the waves he showed that the latter , freely transmitted by non-conductors , are nevertheless refracted . In describing the results of reflection he drew attention to the fact that since only electrical phenomena were being detected , it was to be supposed that a magnetic effect would be observable in a plane perpendicular to that in which the electric was polarised ; and this he was able to detect by using a low frequency source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elektrischer Kraft . He summarised the result in the following words : " We have applied the term rays of electric force to the phenomena which we have investigated . We may perhaps further designate them as rays of light of very great wave length . The experiments described appear to me at any rate eminently adapted to remove any doubt as to the identity of light , radiant heat , and electromagnetic wave action . " History has completely endorsed his claim . But just as Maxwell 's life was brought to a tragically early end ten years before the complete realisation of his theory of the pervasive nature of electromagnetic action , so with even greater haste was Hertz 's young spirit called away from this mortal stage . Thus those keen eyes , whose perception of the varying intensity of a hardly visible spark had confirmed the greatest physical advance since Newton , never glimpsed even from afar the Promised Land . The rest of the story of Matter and Motion ? the rapid extension of the Hertzian waves down and up , especially up , the scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of matter into systems of energy or , if you prefer it , the materialisation of energy constellations ; the particulate manifestation of wave trains , the oscillatory specification of material particles ; the final ? but is it final ? ? apotheosis of the nature of the physical world in a Walpurgis dance of symbols with no physical meaning ? all this falls within the lifetime of men of science still with us , many of whom have told the story in a series of books to which the reader may turn in order to gain his knowledge at first hand from these great thinkers themselves . It is the object of this
