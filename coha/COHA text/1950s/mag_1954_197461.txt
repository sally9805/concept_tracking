In Park City , returning because United Park City Mines Co. was reopening its big lead and zinc deposits . The mines were shut down in 1952 for lack of demand , and half the population of 4,000 had left town . <P> The decision to reopen the mines was the result of the Administration 's announcement last month of a sharply increased stockpiling program for both lead and zinc . There was hope that Government buying would raise the price of lead by 1 to 15 a lb. , and of zinc a penny to 12 . Western mining experts thought this would be enough to bring reasonable prosperity to their depressed industry , cause the opening of additional mines . Already the price of both metals was up . <P> The stockpiling was not the only reason for the price improvement . Increased demand from industries climbing out of their recession had boosted the price of lead from 12 last February to 14 before the stockpiling started . Other metals were moving up steadily , too . This week the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 118 in January ( 1947-49 : 100 ) . <P> The biggest jump was in mercury , which has soared over 85% from the January low of $187 for a 76-lb. flask . Last week mercury rose another $4 to $6 a flask , causing one veteran trader to complain that " the market 's just plain crazy . " But there was a reason : producers were not running their mines full tilt to take care of big new demands for the metal ( e.g. , in the atomic field ) for fear that the demand would disappear while they were spending a lot of money expanding . But when the Administration recently guaranteed the producers a fixed market over 3 years for 200,000 flasks at $225 , the mines began stepping up output in a hurry ( e.g. , New India Mining &; Chemical , biggest U.S. producer , up 60% in a few months ) . As more mines start up , the Government thinks that the price will steady .                 @ @ @ @
