Early this year , to the surprise of no one , California 's Governor Goodwin J. Knight announced that he was a " nominal " candidate for the Republican presidential nomination . He wants the yoman California delegation pledged 1 ) to President Eisenhower , if he chooses to run , and 2 ) to Goodie himself if Ike is not a candidate . The governor 's announcement was a warning to others-especially Vice President Richard Nixon-who might covet the delegation for themselves and try to capture it at next June 's primary . This week Knight underscored the warning with another announcement of considerable significance : " I have asked Clem Whitaker and Leone Baxter to serve as our campaign directors . " <P> Whitaker &; Baxter , political pressagents , are a lanky , gentle-looking white-haired man and an uncommonly pretty redhead . In nearly 25 years , the firm of Whitaker &; Baxter has managed 75 political campaigns ( all but two confined to California ) and has lost only five . Their biggest foray onto the national political landscape was management of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan . <P> In private life , Clem , 56 , and Leone , a youthful looking 49 , are Mr. and Mrs. Whitaker . They alternate at being president and vice president , switching jobs every year . They hardly know the pronoun " I " ; almost always they are " we . " Usually , they answer telephone calls together on two extensions , divide profits equally , plot their campaigns together ( often in the seclusion of an oceanside resort ) . Clem has a genius for long-range planning and Leone tends to defer to his political judgment . Leone is a talented writer , a minter of bright ideas , and more the day-to-day executive than Clem . <P> The partnership began in 1933 , at a meeting in Sacramento . At the time , the state legislature had just passed a bill authorizing the Central Valley Project , which was conceived largely as a flood-control , irrigation and salinity-control development in Northern California . But the powerful Pacific Gas &; Electricity Co. correctly foresaw that the project might become a threat to private power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm , State Senator Jack McColl and other Central Valley advocates called a strategy meeting and asked Whitaker , a rising young pressagent , to sit in . Also at the meeting was Leone Smith Baxter , 26 , a recent widow who was also something of an expert in publicity as well as a prime mover in the C.V.P. <P> Clem and Leone agreed to run the campaign together for a frugal $40,000 . Bearing down on the farmers and making heavy use of small-town newspapers and the relatively uncultivated medium of radio , they defeated the referendum handily . The astonished Pacific Gas &; Electric Co. promptly signed Whitaker &; Baxter to an annual retainer , has employed them ever since . Incorporating themselves as Campaigns , Inc. , they became the acknowledged originals in the field of political public relations ( they are still the world 's only permanent specialists in the field ) . In 1938 they made it a full-time partnership by getting married , and settling down in a rambling Marin County house with a heated , kidney-shaped swimming pool .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
