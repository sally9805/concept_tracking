Into the $18,000-a-year job of press secretary for President Truman this week stepped Joseph Hudson Short Jr. , 46 , Virginia Military Institute graduate , veteran newsman and Baltimore Sun White House correspondent for the last five years . Mississippi-born Joe Short got to know Harry Truman well while covering his vice-presidential campaign of 1944 , has been a good friend ever since . <P> As Short moved in , Stephen T. Early , who had been filling in since the death of Charles G. Ross ( TIME , Dec. 18 ) , bowed out with a little quip . Said Early , now a vice president of Pullman , Inc. : " If it was a job as a dollar-a-year man , I figure the President owes me about four and six-tenths cents . "
