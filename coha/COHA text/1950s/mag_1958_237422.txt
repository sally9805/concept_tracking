" Such a nice family , " decided Staten Island neighbors soon after Dr. and Mrs. Melvin Nimer summer-rented the red brick and grey shingle house at 242 Vanderbilt Avenue . Not that neighbors saw Dr. Nimer much ; he was busy as a new resident in surgery at the massive ( 800-bed ) U.S. Public Health Service Hospital three blocks away , overlooking lower New York Harbor . But vivacious Loujean Nimer , like her husband 31 years old , was friendly . So were crew-cut Melvin Jr. , 8 , toddling Gregory , 2 , and even five-month-old Jennifer , born shortly before the Nimers came east from Phoenix . Such a nice family . <P> To Mormons Melvin and Loujean Nimer , there was no finer compliment . Since the autumn day in 1946 when Melvin hurried home from the Navy to Orem , Utah , and married his high school sweetheart , a nice family and a happy , secure family life had been their goals .

In Staten Island the Nimers made the first payment on a new five-room , $18,000 ranch house , excitedly got ready for the big move this week . <P> Stranger in the Night . Home from a family picnic one day last week , the Nimers turned in early . Waking in the night , Melvin Jr . rubbed open his eyes , saw standing over his bed a strange man in overalls and white mask . The boy screamed for his mother ; Loujean dashed in from the next bedroom . The stranger wheeled , flicked a knife ; Loujean staggered to her bed with wounds in breast and abdomen .

Clutching her crimsoning nightgown she dialed the operator , gasped : " Please help me ! Call the police ! We 're being murdered here !

" Counseled the operator : " No . Stay inside . Stay by your mother . " <P> Last Instruction . The cops found the house unrobbed and untouched , and no sure clue as to how the housebreaker had come or gone . The Nimers were conscious but in pain . One policeman tried to raise Melvin 's head from the kitchen floor ; gently , Melvin ordered him not to , and braced his feet against a wall to ease his agony . While being carried to an ambulance on a stretcher , Loujean opened her eyes . Said she to a policeman : " Please feed the baby plain milk . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
