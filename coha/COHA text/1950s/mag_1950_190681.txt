The stage was set for the final battle in the " police action " in Korea . This week General Douglas MacArthur broadcast his second ultimatum to the North Koreans : " I , as the United Nations Commander in Chief , for the last time call upon you and the forces under your command , in whatever part of Korea situated , forthwith to lay down your arms and cease hostilities . " MacArthur was ready to hit the Communists above the 38th parallel with another coordinated air-sea-ground offensive . <P> The brilliant landing at Inchon had been executed while the enemy still held the initiative and numerical superiority in manpower . This time the odds would be overwhelmingly on the U.N . side . <P> Outclassed . The Communists were in precipitate flight to a new , hastily organized defensive position stretching from the peninsula 's west coast near Pyongyang , the North Korean capital , to Wonsan , traffic junction and port on the eastern shore . They were heavily outclassed in equipment . The advantage of numbers had passed to the U.N . forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regimental combat teams ( about 125,000 men ) , six South Korean divisions ( about 60,000 men ) , one Australian and two British battalions ( about 3,000 men ) . The Eighth Army was battle-hardened and victory-flushed , had unchallenged air support . For amphibious operations it had an equally unchallenged Navy : six aircraft carriers , the U.S. battleship Missouri , six cruisers , hundreds of destroyers , landing craft and other vessels . <P> The North Koreans had lost all but remnants of 13 divisions below the 38th parallel . They had suffered scores of thousands killed and wounded . Some 50,000 North Koreans were P.W.s . Almost all their tanks and trucks committed in the southern fighting had been knocked out or abandoned . They had no air cover . Their naval defense was limited to a few patrol boats and the sowing of Russian-made mines . To man their defenses above the 38th parallel they had two reserve divisions , the remnants from the south and a batch of new , poorly trained recruits , a force totaling about 200,000 . <P> Outflanked . For supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 miles from the Manchurian and Siberian borders . U.N . air power harassed and hampered these lines . They could be cut at a critical point by a U.N . landing above or below the mudflats on the west coast opposite Pyongyang . Once MacArthur 's men were ashore again , the U.N . would have another anvil on which the hammer of troops advancing from the south could crush the enemy 's last organized forces and thus pound out the final victory . <P> Only a Chinese Communist or Russian army marching to the aid of the Korean comrades could possibly stave off a swift defeat for the Red aggressors . But more &; more such intervention seemed unlikely . The time for it would have been a month ago when a relatively minor effort might have pushed U.N . forces into a Dunkirk on their southern beachhead . Now , for a change , not the free world but the enemy had acted too little and too late . <P> <P> * Last week the famed 3rd U.S. Infantry Division , under Major General Robert H. Soule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it made four amphibious landings ( North Africa , Sicily , Anzio , France ) , took more casualties ( 34,224 ) than any other infantry division , was one of the war 's most decorated outfits.
