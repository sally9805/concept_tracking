txt Letters to The Times ALVIN JOHNSONMASON OLCOTT.H.Y . ORGELARTHUR E. WYNN . Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In your issue of March 10 you reported a meeting at the New School and the Hotel Grosvenor to discuss the methods of research of a joint project of the State Commission Against Discrimination and the New School to study the bearing of discrimination on the problems of poverty . The discussions at the meeting were extremely interesting and helpful . But all this should not gloss over the fact that , the state commission has to operate under a law that greatly reduces its effective-ness : For a very good reason I was deeply interested in the bill now shelved to authorize the state commission to initiate regulatory action and investigations and studies . The reason is that as chairman of the War Commission Against Discrimination I initiated the appeal to Governor Dewey which set up the commission to prepare a law against discrimination . Irving Ives was chairman and I was vice chairman ; Charles H. Tuttle , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his $75,000 salary for the time to serve our commission gratis . Stand of Members Governor Dewey , himself an enemy of discrimination , set up a truly representative commission of twenty-one members . At the first meeting I found that besides our eminent counsel there was only one member , Frank Weil , besides myself , who felt that any law against discrimination could work . But we educated ourselves in discussion , thanks principally to the masterly tact of our counsel , Charles Tuttle . In the end we were unanimous for the bill which became law , with the exception of two members , one tied as an employe of the Associatdd Industries , the other as an official of a railway union which reached far into the South . We had much discussion on the question how the commission we proposed to establish should operate . Those of us who knew something of the science of administration wished to see the commission authorized to proceed on its own initiative to make inquiries , institute proceedings where it found prima facie evidence of a pattern of discrimination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , felt that the initiative should be left to aggrieved parties , that the law might develop case by case . The weight of opinion with us , so far as I could judge , was to give the commission power to make its own inquiries , to institute proceedings on its own . We knew well how precarious was the position of the individual who felt he was discriminated against . We also realized how unfair it would be to bring proceedings against one employer while his competitors were equally guilty of the offense of discrimination but had no employes to submit complaints . My own experience as chairman of the War Committee Against Discrimination had proved to me the great majority of employers , the great majority of labor leaders would prefer to follow non-discriminatory policies . , An employer , a union , discriminates because everybody is doing it . The law , to be effective , should bear down equally on everybody . Acceptable Bill But our problem was to get our bill through the Legislature , and we accepted with misgivings a bill which we knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less opposition in the Legislature , hoping that the time would come when an amendment could pass that would give us a really workable law . It is a ridiculous idea that the elimination of discrimination in industry , commerce and housing would be injurious to business . Good business normally would select the best man , irrespective of color , race or religion . Good real estate practice would select the best tenant , without discrimination . The law does not ask the business man to select any employe , any tenant , who does not square up with the best . All the law asks is the selection of the best , without irrational and outdated prejudices . ALVIN JOHNSON , President Emeritus , The New School . New York , Revising U. N. Voting To THE EDITOR OF THE New YorkTImEs : Karl Loewenstein , in his letter appearing in The Times of March 3 , proposes that the United Nations jump the voting weight of the great powers from one to five . His goal is splendid , and his idea provocative . Something of the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations into great , middle and smaller powers would be invidious , even if they are ? self-chosen . The ? smaller and more recent a country is , the more it treasures its sovereignty and its standing . There 's no need to give the great powers five votes . Instead , why riot take such steps as these : ( 1 ) Add one vote for each U. N. member whose population exceeds 10,000,000. ( 2 ) Add another vote for each member that makes a financial contribution to the U. N. of , say , $250,000 , or more . Such measures would be easy to apply and would not be invidious . They would give enough voting power to the countries that could back up Assembly resolutions making for ' peace . Nations with small nuMbem Security Risk Law Upheld To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I wonder why Charles A. Siepr mann , chairman of the board of directors of the New York Civil Liberties Union , is so worried over the unmodified New York State Security Law as he expressed himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with true liberal philosophy by making a statement such as , " It is rily : fervent hope that Governor Harriman , who has many times bespoken the liberal philosophy , will veto thiS law . " There are all kinds of liberals , and I am sure Governor Harriman is not the kind who is liberal with the security of our country . The chairman intimates that the Korean crisis is over and that " laws already on the statute books amply protect us against subversion . " I wonder how he came to this conclusion . Ori March 3 it was reported in The New , York Times : " The Senate Internal Security subcommittee reported today that it had encountered considerable evidence of Communist agtivities in the press , radio , televi : sion and in political matters in its investigation during 1956 . " ? : . Had he read the report in full , h-ei would : not feel the Security Risk Law means " redundant and ridiculous.1 ARTHUR E. WYNN. - Forest Hills , N.

MASON OLCOTT . New York , March 4 , 1957 . Arab Refugee Problem Reply Is Made to Recent Statements Regarding Their Exodus To THE EDITOR T NEWYORE.TIMES In attempting to answer two al. , leged inaccuracies in a recent editorial , Sami Hadawi of the Palestine Arab Refugee Office , in his letter published in your columns on Feb .. 27 , makes a number of inaccuate statements which should be cox ' ? rected . Mr , Hadawi refers to " Village Statistics-1945 , " published by the Palestine Government . In saying " a small percentage of land was held by Jews , " he obviously wishes the reader to believe that the balance was owned by the Arab inhabitants of Palestine . Detailed data on pub , lic lands in Palestine , officially pub , lished in the Mandatory Government 's " Survey of Palestine-1946 ' show that over 70 per cent of the land in Palestine was public domain , not owned by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel this state domain passed from the British Mandatory Goverriment to the Government of Israel . Arab claims and figures concerre ; ing land properties abandoned by the refugees should be examined with care , as . the figures are without foundation . The United Nations ; Conciliation Commission for Palestine set up a special office for compiling a record of refugee land holdings . In its first report on Oct. 4 ; 1956 ( U. N. Document A/3199 ) , the commission acknowledges the cooperation of the Israeli Government in its task . Until the report is concluded all figures mentioned by Arab spokesmen must be regarded as propaganda and not fact . Facts Unchanged All attempts by Arab propagan- , dists to rewrite the history of the refugee problem can not change the documented facts , which show clearly that it was the Arab leaders in the neighboring states who urged the refugees to evacuate their , homes and promised them a quick return in the wake of what it was hoped would be victorious Arab armies . Mr. Hadawi states that it would be common sense alone for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Indeed over 160,000 Palestinian ' Arabs did do just what Mr. Hadawi ; suggests . They are today full zens of Israel , with all the rights and responsibilities of citizenship in. the State of Israel . To say that on April 30 , 1948 ; when the Hagana entered the Hata ; mon Quarter in Jerusalem , " not a. single soldier from any Arab state was on Palestine soil " is another attempt to rewrite history . Arab attacks against the Jewish state . began on the very morrow of the U. N. Partition Resolution of Nov. ' 29 , 1947 . In its first special report to the Security Council the U. N. Pales-. tine Commission stated on Feb. 16 , 1948 ( six weeks before Mr. Hadawi. left Katamon ) : " Powerful Arab interests , both inside and outside Palestine , are de- , fying the resolution of the General Assembly and are engaged in deliberate effort to alter by force the settlement envisaged therein .
