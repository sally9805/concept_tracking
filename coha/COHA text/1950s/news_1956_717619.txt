txt One of the misapprehensions about the recommendations of the Hoover Commission is that they are all difficult to realize , either because or the rigidities of law or the inertia of politics .

One of the promises in his State of the Union Message is that he will begin soon to apply some of the recommendations which.can be carried out simply on the authority of the Execu : five Department . It is surprising how much could be done just by the will to do it . Altogether the Hoover Commission made more than 300. recommendations for changes in procedure , consolidation of functions or the elimination of needless activities .

But as our Mr. Chamberlain shows in his current series on the Hoover reports , the maneuvering area available to the President is.stilt wide . To give just a couple of examples : About $253 million a year could be saved by Executive action requiring various departments to exchange storage place facilities and by better utilization of commercial warehouses . Again , by selling surplus real estate and improving its management of the retained property the Government could pick up an estimated billion dollars for the Treasury and then save an additional $100 million annually . The savings on each - item are not small ; in the aggregate they could be immense .
