Rudolf Slansky , a tall , red-haired butcher 's son from a village near Pilsen , was a devoted Communist . A member of the Czech party since he was 18 , he made a fine hatchetman-unmoved by compassion , unhampered by principle , unburdened with personal loyalties . Unlike so many Czech politicos who fled to London in World War II , he went to Moscow . There he lived for six years in a special compound reserved for the elite among foreign Communists . He became a better Muscovite than a Czech , which made him a fine teammate for another graduate of the special compound , Klement Gottwald . <P> Gottwald was amiable , good at fooling nonCommunists , an effective front man . But he had to be watched . It was Gottwald who almost put Czechoslovakia into the Marshall Plan in 1947 and had to go to Moscow a few days later for a dressing down . Slansky was never popular in Czechoslovakia . He became the behind-the-scenes man , ran the party apparatus as its secretary general . <P> Slansky arranged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , used his power as secretary general to install his own people in vital jobs . He was also Moscow 's watchdog , and even kept an eye on President Gottwald himself ( who , when he has one drink too many , has a habit of talking sarcastically about Communist bigwigs ) . At Cominform meetings it was Slansky , not Gottwald , who represented Prague . <P> The Holy Truth . Czechoslovakia , with a higher standard of living than Russia 's , is the Kremlin 's prize capture . But even the Czech economy sagged under Moscow 's insatiable demands for Czech machinery and industrial products . Looking around for higher &; higher scapegoats , Slansky clapped into jail Gottwald 's good friend , Foreign Minister Vladimir dementis and Slansky 's own good friend Madame Marie Svermova , widow of a Czech Communist hero . <P> Still Czechoslovakia 's performance displeased Moscow , and the people 's discontent grew . At an emergency meeting of government officials and party leaders last September , President Gottwald complained that the blame was traceable to one man-Rudolf Slansky . " Comrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " when he says the blame is all with me . " Slansky 's job as secretary general was abolished , and the party was placed more firmly in Gottwald 's control . <P> A History Unveiled . Then the script changed . Slansky did not disappear . He was " promoted " to Vice Premier and given control of all Czech economic affairs . He continued to get a big play in the Czech press . On his soth birthday last July 30 , he got the Order of Socialism from Gottwald . Only last month the government unveiled with a flourish Slansky 's two-volume history of Communism . <P> Then , one morning last week , the Prague radio announced that " hitherto unknown facts have come to light . They convict Slansky of activities against the state . . . He has been placed in custody . "
