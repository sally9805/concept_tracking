In Paris this week delegates from France , Western Germany , Italy and the Benelux nations gather in the august Salon de I'Horloge of the French Foreign Ministry . Their task is to hammer out an agreement which will give substance to Robert Schuman 's bold plan for pooling Western Europe 's coal and steel industries . To most of the delegates it means the practical beginning of an undertaking which in the past has been little more than an oratorical flourish : Western Europe 's union . But above the hopeful voices in Paris was audible a disturbing buzz-the voice of doctrinaire Socialism . <P> In its ill-timed pamphlet setting forth its attitude toward Western European integration ( see below ) , the British Labor Party had gone far beyond the understandable , if disappointing , caution which the British government had so far displayed toward the Schuman Plan . Despite all of Prime Minister Clement Attlee 's subsequent attempts to soften the blow , the Labor Party had finally , bluntly admitted what it had long suggested by its actions : it was dead set against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled by Socialists , 2 ) involved a sacrifice of national sovereignty , i.e. , the national Socialist 's sovereign right to plan as he pleased . No one could blame the Schuman Plan 's supporters if they reached the conclusion that it had become a matter ( in the words of the London Economist ) of " Socialism Contra Mundum . " <P> When the first squall caused by the Labor pamphlet had quieted down , it became evident that the British government was still far from a flat stand against one of the world 's best hopes . British officials last week cagily lifted a few inches of heavy wrapping from something called the Plowden Plan . Drafted by Treasury 's Chairman of the Economic Planning Board Sir Edwin Plowden , it offered as its main feature a coal-steel pool without the sweeping powers which Schuman had called for . It held out some strictly limited hope that a practical compromise between the British and the continental powers might yet be reached . Nervously the British declared that they would be glad to submit the Plowden Plan at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London correspondent : " The British observers in Paris are under instructions which in effect say , ' Speak only when spoken to . ' " <P> Meanwhile , last week 's controversy could not obscure the fact that Europe 's traditional enemies , France and Germany , were prepared to deliver to some European authority the guts of their industries . Said one German delegate : " This in effect is the Peace Conference . For whatever we sign will be a treaty that we will not , that we can not , fight each other again . "
