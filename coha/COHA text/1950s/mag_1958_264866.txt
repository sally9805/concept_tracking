Slim , tousle-haired Jeannette Vermeersch , wife of ailing Red Boss Maurice Thorez and herself Communist candidate for the National Assembly , spoke with passion for two hours . She railed against " capitalist exploiters , " but her words fell on a lethargic gathering of scarcely 30 people , even though she was speaking in the grimy 18th arrondissement , the reddest of the Red districts of Paris . In tiny Ecurie ( pop . 362 ) , only 15 men and a runny-nosed boy turned out to hear Socialist Guy Mollet review his premiership , blame " the Americans " for preventing the Anglo-French conquest of Suez . Were any problems bothering his listeners ? he asked . " Classrooms for our children , " responded one man . <P> " You Know Me . " If they did not vote for him , said Mollet amiably on parting , they should vote for any representative of a " national " party : " I ask only one thing of you : do n't vote Bolshevik ! " Even flamboyant Jacques Soustelle , De Gaulle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Algeria , was running a low-keyed campaign . His election posters read : " You know me ; you know what I 've done ; you know what I will do ! " <P> On two successive Sundays , the voters of France were to elect the first Parliament of the new Fifth Republic . They went about it with an apathy that disturbed the politicians . Some voters seemed to feel that in voting for De Gaulle they had freed themselves of all that parliamentary nonsense . Except for the Communists and a few independents such as Pierre Mends-France ( who is being attacked as having " sold out to Anglo-American Jewocracy " ) , virtually every candidate was clinging like death to Charles de Gaulle 's coattails . Forbidden to use his name , at least four parties ran on his Cross of Lorraine symbol . But despite a profusion of new labels , the faces were generally the same old ones , including at least a dozen former Premiers of France . <P> Down Goes Mendes . In the first Sunday 's voting , the Gaullist label @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaullist party defeated two ex-Premiers , Joseph Laniel and , most surprising of all , Pierre Mends-France ( after 26 years in Parliament ) . <P> Leading candidates who failed of a majority the first time would have to run next Sunday , and in this category were ex-Premiers Mollet , Georges Bidault , Paul Reynaud and Felix Gaillard . Even though there was a big Communist vote , most of their leaders failed to get elected even in safe constituencies , and must face runoffs where other candidates will combine against them .
