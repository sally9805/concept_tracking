One of Washington 's bitterest technical squabbles , the long rivalry between aircraft-guidance systems , reached a new phase last week . The Air Coordinating Committee announced a compromise plan that looks like a desperate attempt to offend no one . The plan recommends that both guidance systems , VOR ( Very High Frequency Omnirange ) and TACAN ( Tactical Air Navigation ) be " combined " under the hybrid name of VORTAC . <P> VOR , with " Distance Measuring Equipment " ( DME ) , is the present civilian-guidance system . The Civil Aeronautics Administration has installed 480 of its ground stations , and will install 82 more during the current fiscal year at a cost of $86,000 a station . The stations tell a properly equipped airplane its direction and distance . <P> TACAN does much the same thing by a different electronic method . The Air Force and Navy prefer it chiefly because its ground stations are much smaller and work better from a ship or a cluttered land site . The military have installed their TACAN stations independently of the CAA . Twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being set up . Chief civilian objection to TACAN is that it is new , untried and will force non-military aircraft to install costly new equipment . <P> Under the compromise proposed by the Air Coordinating Committee , the VOR stations will continue indefinitely to tell aircraft their direction . They will gradually stop , however , telling aircraft their distance . In many cases this service will conflict electronically with TACAN and so must be eliminated . Unless the Government foots the bill , civil-aircraft operators will eventually have to buy costly new electronics . Cost of a full VORTAC system : $4,100 . <P> TACAN will be developed rapidly for military purposes . After it has been well tested by military use , its directional as well as its distance-measuring feature may be made available to civilians . Loudest objectors are owners of private aircraft , who feel that the military has loaded them with impossible electronic costs .
