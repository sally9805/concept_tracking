LOOKING FOR THE PROMISED LAND Over 1000 Puerto Ricans stream into U.S. cities each week . A few find the jobs and homes they dream of , but many become the victims of a way of life they do not understand . he clatter of chattering children competed th the roar of the plane 's engines to create a eerful , unrelenting crescendo . Two small ys bumped heads after their mother gave rmission to dip into her crammed shopping g for a snack . Another youngster whim-red and nursed an ear which had been fled after he maneuvered his little sister ray from a window seat . This was Eastern Air Lines Flight 831 , ten mites out of New York , and its passengers picnic-style flight to ? re settling down for a n Juan . The cost : 852.50 . Low air fare , I had n told , was one of the reasons why some 20(X) working-class passengers per week had turned the New York-San , Juan run into a commuters ' shuttle .

Some were returning because they were homesick ; others because they had failed to find work or had banked enough to retire  --  temporarily at least . More than a million such people have flown north from their cramped little island since 1945 , and many have returned disappointed . " They come up here expecting a gold rush , " one social worker told me , " and they usually find nothing but the rush . " I turned to the passenger next to me  --  a husky , dark-haired man who was folding and unfolding his big fingers . He looked uncomfortable in the tight , double-breasted suit jacket he wore over a checkered shirt . I remarked on the fine flying weather . He smiled and indicated that his English was not very good . I assured him that my Spanish was worse , then managed to explain that I was going to Puerto Rico to learn why and how people migrated to the mainland . When I introduced myself , he ( continued on Page 10 ) ( Continued from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his breast pocket and handed it to me . It was a payroll slip . and his name appeared under the name of a Northern California steel plant . I pretended not to notice the 5260 figure on the slip , but my companion insisted on making his point . For only two weeks ! " he said proudly . On him , the flush of success looked good . He told me he was returning to his home near Arecibo after an absence of nearly three years . He had been living with a brother and sister-in-law near San Francisco . He did not like being away from his wife and children , but the patch of land he owned was a small one and it had been difficult to provide well for a family . Now he was to have a five-month vacation before returning to the steel mill . It would be nice to be home and to taste piiicin de amoral ? ( meat-and-plantain casserole ) again . He reached into a sack under our scat and produced a fragrant , foil-wrapped package . Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steaks that had sustained him on his trip from California . We ate one apiece . Then he fell asleep , and I did n't speak to him again until we parted company at San Juan . California has been good to many of this steelworker 's compatriots  --  including such notables as actor Jose Ferrer of Hollywood , and ballplayer Orlando Cepeda , lately of San Francisco . Indeed there are clusters of Puerto Ricans in every corner of the United States today . But most Puerto Ricans still prefer New York City , and the movement west is slow . Less than twelve years ago . 95 per cent of the Puerto Ricans on the mainland lived in New York . Today New York has more Puerto Rican citizens than ever ( more than 650,000 ) , but its percentage of the mainland total has dropped to about 75 . According to an estimate of New York 's Department of City Planning , 22 per cent of Manhattan 's residents will be classified as Puerto Rican by 1970 . One subway line has so many Spanish-speaking passengers that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compared to history 's great population shifts , the Puerto Rican migration to the mainland is not significant . But in America , in this age of immigration quotas , it is a notable phenomenon . The chronicle of the migration is a story of how a partially cooled melting pot is making room for what may be its last great influx from a " foreign " land . Our history books record that at various stages in America 's past , Jews were referred to collectively as " Bolshevists , " and Chinese as " groveling worms . " Newly arrived Slavic and Italian miners were met by armed mobs , and employment agencies displayed signs reading , " No Irish Need Apply . " Now the Puerto Rican is at the bottom of the pecking order , and he is hurdling many of the same obstacles faced by newcomers who preceded him . In one significant way , the migrant from San Juan is unlike the newcomer from Warsaw or Sicily or County Cork . Because he is an American citizen he is expeered to speak English and know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he does not . Conversely , because he is an American , the Puerto Rican does n't always look at a trip to our mainland as a momentous or irrevocable step , as most newcomers before him did . He can fly here anytime  --  for a week 's pay  --  to harvest fruit for a season , to care for the children of a sick relative or simply to visit Uncle Felipe in Brooklyn . A visitor with such a short-term goal need not bother to acclimate himself . The great waves of immigrants who preceded the Puerto Ricans came here in clusters and settled in national colonies where a man could live a lifetime without learning English . But the beginning of the Puerto Rican migration coincided with the era of the public-housing project , and the slums which were marked for destruc- T lion very often were the ones which housed the newcomers . Partly as a result of this uprooting process , and partly because slum housing is so spread out , Puerto Ricans now are living in every corner of New York City . Aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York , this migration is unique in many respects : It is the mainland 's first major influx from a tropical land . It is a migration of young families . In 1957 there were 20,553 births among Puerto Rican families in New York  --  and only 1422 deaths . It is bringing to the mainland a substantial number of non-English-speaking Negroes . About a tenth of the migrants are classified by census takers as Negro . It is the first " commuting migration " from outside the continental United States . Every year tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans move back to their island . It is also a migration that has stirred up hostilities . On a spring evening in 1957 , a young Puerto Rican , just discharged from the Army , was kicked to death outside a Brooklyn tavern because bar patrons objected to his speaking to his brother in Spanish . And , in New Jersey , a Superior Court judge  --  since removed from his bench by Governor Meyner  --  remarked publicly that if you put Puerto Ricans into palaces , they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puerto Ricans began after World War II . The island 's workers were desperate then , for while the war had brought prosperity to U.S. wage earners , it created economic chaos in most of Puerto Rico . There was no heavy industry on the island in the early ' 40 's , and U-boats made Caribbean shipping so hazardous that Puerto Rico had no market for her nonessential exports . When the war ended , many Puerto Ricans , especially ex-G.I. ' s , saw migration as the only solution to their economic dilemma . They did nor migrate to escape Puerto Rico 's fine climate ; they left to find work . This fact was verified in 1954 , a year of mild recession and Few job opportunities , when net migration to New York dropped to one third the 69,000 figure of 1953. in the tight-money years of 1957-58 , net migration once again dropped sharply . As a result of the island 's dynamic industrialization program , " Operation Bootstrap , " the number of factories has increased more than a hundredfold since World War II , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the population continues to grow , despite the tremendous emigrati on and a government-sponsored birth-control program . If the forty-nine states were as densely populated as Puerto Rico , they would contain almost all the people of the world . The island 's topsy-turvy wage scales also affect migration . In an efficient new Bootstrap plant at Salinas , Puerto Rico , I watched a young mother doing unskilled assembly work on ball-point pens . She was paid a dollar an hour . This money had to support her husband , who , because he could not find work , spent his days caring for the children . ( Factory jobs have given independence to many Puerto Rican women  --  and , as a result , the island 's divorce rate has soared . ) In a clothing factory at Mayaguez , a woman of fifty toiled at a sewing operation far more demanding than the pen-factory job , yet she averaged only fifty cents an hour . The reason for this disparity is that in Puerto Rico , a minimum-wage scale is established for each industry , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pen factory told me that few girls leave his plant to seek better jobs on the mainland . But the owner of the garment factory is hit hard by the exodus , for in New York a good sewing-machine operator can make ninety dollars a week . " Unfortunately , " this manufacturer says , " our factory hinges on twenty-five key operators  --  and those are the ones who take off . " Although the lure of a better job market set the stage for migration , it was cut-rate air travel that provided the impetus . In the postwar boom , scheduled airlines slashed their fares , and dozens of nonscheduled carriers offered tickets for as little as thirty-five dollars . ( Rock-bottom price today is forty-five dollars . ) Puerto Rican communities now can be found in more than 100 towns and cities on the mainland . After New York , the ten U.S. cities with the greatest number of Puerto Rican residents arc  --  in probable descending order  --  Chicago ; Philadelphia ; Newark , New Jersey ; Bridgeport , Connecticut ; Buffalo ; Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Hartford , Connecticut ; and Rochester , New York . All have 4500 or more Puerto Rican residents . Milwaukee offers a good example of how a Puerto Rican community may spring up in a city . In 1951 the Puerto Rican government responded to a request from a Milwaukee iron foundry for thirty-six workers . The happy letters sent by these men to their home barrio were full of praise for Milwaukee . Their rapture for their new home attracted many others , who in turn wrote enthusiastic letters . The Puerto Rican population of Milwaukee now exceeds 3000 ? mostly friends or kin of the original thirty-six . An extensive orientation program on the island prepares many migrants for mainland climate and living conditions . " But , " says one orientation worker . " we never can anticipate who is going or when they are going . We ca n't require anyone to come to us for advice . " One migrant , when asked if he was going to the States , replied , " No .

More than a week later his frantic wife April received a letter and check from Illinois . Her husband had met a hiring boss  --  operating without government authorization  --  and had been whisked off the island so fast that he did n't haven chance to leave word he would be late for supper , What sort of citizen is the Puerto Rican migrant ? The average migrant , like the errant sugar-cane worker , does not allow a mere clock to govern his life . lAt one Spanish-speaking church in New York , the Sunday service begins " between eleven and twelve  --  sharp .

( Thirty Puerto Ricans in Chicago responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded congressmen . ) Carmen and Celso Ayala , of Long Island City , are in most respects typical of those who have migrated to New York . The Ayalas had only three rooms in BayamOn  --  for themselves and their nine children . Business was slow in the two-man barbershop where Celso worked , and Carmen 's job in a clothing factory added only thirteen dollars a week to the family income . In 1953 Carmen visited New York . She returned home convinced that her family would find opportunity there . When a friend brought word of a " Barber Wanted " sign in a Brooklyn window , Celso agreed to pull up stake . He wrote a letter to the Brooklyn shop and got the job . The decision to move called for sacrifice . It meant that for a year Celso and Carmen and their eldest son , Gamaliel , would be building a nest egg in New York , while the eldest daughter , Maria , watched over the other children in Bayamon . To save money for eight plane tickets , father , mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's apartment . Gradually , by purchasing tickets a couple at a time on a deferred-payment plan , the family was united again . The Ayalas moved four times during their first two years in New York . Their income increased and they managed to save a little money . Then came a rare opportunity  --  a four-room , rent-controlled apartment at only $32.65 a month . There was a hitch , of course . The previous tenant would not vacate unless the Ayalas would shell out $500 for his " furniture " ( one aged refrigerator , one lamp , one sofa ) . They scraped together the money and moved in . Soon they learned that they had been taken . Their building was scheduled to be torn down to make room for new apartments . Today , barber Ayala has a line , six-room apartment in a Long Island City public-housing project and he is glad he came to the mainland . He has two grandchildren now . He devotes much of his spare time to activities at La Hermosa ( The Beautiful ) , a Spanish church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his final installment payments on an expensive sewing machine and typewriter " so that my children will learn skills and have more opportunity . " " My father 's big regret , " Gamaliel told me , " is that he still can not speak English well . lie likes to meet and talk with people , and here , because of the language , he often feels isolated . " One of the most heartening aspects of this migration is the sense of responsibility Puerto Rico has displayed toward people with problems like those faced by the Ayalas . The Commonwealth Government is thought to be the first in history ever to set up offices in another land to 41 assist people who are settling there . An eighty-five-man Migration Division is maintained in New York , and ten smaller offices are strung from Massachusetts to I I lin ois . Migration workers assist migrants at the airport , issue identification cards as proof of citizenship , operate a job-placement service and acquaint the newcomer with community services . The work of this single Labor Department division cost the Puerto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most f Continued on Page 44 ) ( Continued from Poky 41 ) states spend on their entire labor departments . " Our job , " Clarence Senior , Migration Division chief , tells his staff , " is to work ourselves out of a job . We want the Puerto Rican communities on the mainland to get to the point where they will take on the responsibility of helping zwcorners over the initial ho rules . " How long will the migration to the mainland continue ? " The energy of growth in Puerto Rican industry has been channelized into increasing wages rather than increasing jobs , " Governor Munoz told this writer . " At a given time , the growth of the economy will be enough to take up the slack . We figure that time will be in 1975 . " In the meantime , the process of adjustment to big-city living grinds on  --  and , in New York at least , this is not always pleasant . While investigating living conditions in the city , one housing expert found thirty migrants forced to share a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converted coal cellar . An encouraging approach to the Puerto Ricans ' housing problem was taken in Manhattan 's Chelsea district , in a combined effort by three city departments and the Hudson Guild Neighborhood House . The project focused on seven ancient tenements which had been converted into a " hotel " known as The New California . Some 600 people , mostly Puerto Ricans , were housed there in less than 100 one-and two-room units . An investigator found The New California to be one of the worst slums in the city : " Shower compartments were being used as refrigerators or clothes closets , refrigerator doors as swings , public halls as blackboards , stairs as toilets . " When the landlord responded to a summons , he complained that tenants had broken the boiler , then attempted to heat the building with hallway bonfires . He insisted that he wanted to improve his " hotel " ? if he could be guaranteed that tenants would try to keep it in good repair . The New California Project  --  representing the Hudson Guild , the tenants , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge . Sanitation was stressed , and one day the project suffered a minor setback which drove home a lesson in an unexpected way . The incident occurred during an English class on the patio behind the hotel , when an upstairs tenant carelessly chucked a bag of garbage out her window and into the laps of the assembled class . The result , according to an official report : " The idea began to penetrate that the incinerator was the place for the garbage . " The New California never will be even a second-class hotel , but its residents now have a degree of content ? and a greater measure of pride in their homes . For the Puerto Rican male , the problem of finding a good job in New York often is as difficult as that of finding a decent , reasonably priced apartment . At eight o'clock on the average weekday morning , as many as 300 job seekers gather at the Migration Division office . There are openings for dishwashers and bus boys , and a man with a poor command of English can hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 Puerto Rican kitchen workers . ) Even if he is fortunate enough to find a factory job , a Puerto Rican may have to reckon with the " sweetheart contracts " so often negotiated for him by labor racketeers and unscrupulous employers . As a result , many job applicants at the Migration Division specify a preference for nonunion jobs . During a visit to New York last spring . Puerto Rican Sen. HipOlito Marcano said , " Many times I come across a Puerto Rican here in New York and he tells me he 's a union member , but he does n't know what union or what type of contract . " About one in eight of New York 's Puerto Rican families arc on public-assistance rolls because they ca n't earn enough to maintain a decent standard of living . Most of these families receive only supplementation of income , until their earning power improves . Still , the feeling persists among non-Puerto Ricans that " they come up here to get on relief . " Migrants whose language struggles make it difficult for them to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Aqui se ! labia ltigWs ( English Spoken Here ) . If a migrant is on relief , he may be required to attend English classes , held at such places as the Hudson Guild . A man we will call Rafael Rivera typifies the plight of many migrants . He is forty-three years old , and illiterate . He is able and willing to work , but in his few months in New York he has stumbled and fallen every time he faced a job interviewer . Because of his inability to read Spanish , he had all but given up hope of learning English  --  until he was sent to the Hudson Guild . His progress there has been satisfactory . In another few weeks , he will speak enough English to land a job . But first he must learn to differentiate between " who , " " why " and " where . " A recent teacher-Rivera interchange went like this : The instructor begins slowly , " Now , Mr. Rivera  --  who are you ? " There is a pause . Then , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who are you ? What do you say when you 're not sure of the question ? " " I say  --  please , say that question again . " " Fine . Now , why are you here ? " " 1 am  --  here  --  to learn  --  English . " " How are you ? " " I am  --  fine . " " Where are you ? " " I am  --  Rafael Rivera . " " No , Mr. Rivera . ? . " Patiently the instructor begins the procedure again . Such patience pays off . The Welfare Department claims the Hudson Guild classes , by teaching Puerto Ricans to speak enough English to hold down jobs , saved the city $2,000,000 in public-assistance money in five years ' time . A more rudimentary type of education is being dispensed at the Good Neighbor Church and Community Center , to the Spanish-speaking teen-agers of El Barrio ( also known as East Harlem , or Spanish Harlem ) . The director of the community center is a young Negro named Warren Henry , who seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plague the area . He invites them en masse , using as bait a fine basketball court . " When I get a new team in here , " says Henry , " they immediately complain about the refereeing , because they never had to abide by rules before . " Subtly , the gang structure is broken down as Henry organizes all-star games with boys from different gangs playing on the same team . " Then Chico from the Dragnets finds that Peewee of the Targetcers is not such a bad guy after all . " Henry says that in 254 games over a twelve-month period there were only four real fights ? " which is a better record than Madison Square Garden had . " Some of Warren Henry 's teen-agers join Good Neighbor young people 's groups , where in worshiping and relaxing together they come to see that their individual problems are not quite so rare as they had imagined . At a typical meeting conducted by an assistant pastor , the kids decided to discuss " parents . " The result was a sharp picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You ca n't talk to them , they 're so strict , " complains an attractive , dark-skinned girl . " You ca n't reason with them that you 're in America and that things are different here . " ( Puerto Ricans often refer to the mainland as " America . " ) " That 's right , " another girl says accusingly . " The mothers feel if you go with a boy once , it 's the boy you should marry . " " My mother married a Puerto Rican and it did n't turn out so well , " says a fragile-looking girl . " So she warned us kids not to go out with Puerto Ricans because they 're all jealous and irresponsible . But I started going with a nice Puerto Rican boy . I brought him up to see my mother , and now she accepts him . " One boy suggests that the biggest fear Puerto Rican parents have is the gangs . " I know boys in gangs who wish they were dead . They joined because they thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to steal on Sundays  --  or they get shot . " The minister listens to the outpouring of pent-up emotions , never pointing an accusing finger , but sometimes giving direction to the discussion . " You know , " he says finally , " the thing 1 love about East Harlem is that the younger generation is able to rise above this chaos . I think you should be proud of the fact that you have every right in the world to rebel  --  and do n't . " Other churches are doing equally important work . The East Harlem Protestant Parish , for instance , is carrying out a grim crusade to rescue El Barrio 's young people from heroin addiction . Some 80 per cent of the Puerto Ricans profess to be " my Catcilico " ( very Catholic ) . Yet there are more than 200 Protestant Puerto Rican ministers in the city , and only one Puerto Rican priest , To fill the gap , there are Spanish-speaking , non-Puerto Rican priests in more than a third of New York 's Catholic churches , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey , for instance , the Rev. Pasquale ( " Father Pat " ) Di Buono operates a mobile chapel which serves migrant farm laborers in three counties . Although the neighborhood churches are playing a vital role in helping the migrant to adjust , they are not working alone . There are many voices , some faint , some thundering , that foretell a better day for the mainland 's Puerto Rican population . Listen to George Flanagan , executive director of Brooklyn 's Willoughby House Settlement : " Dealing with the Puerto Ricans is like a vine . It grows on you , The natural warmth of these people , as compared to our Anglo-Saxon cold , is sort of irresistible . " Listen to David Dubinsky , president of the International Ladies ' Garment Workers Union : " We want to welcome them into our hearts and into our fold . " Look in on a Puerto Rican Sunday-school session in a poor section of the South Bronx . The members are voting to " adopt " a South Korean youngster by sending parcels , after hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and homes . But there are children , millions of them , who get their food from garbage cans , who do not know joy , nor how to smile . Let us forget our needs now and think of these others .... " For a real key to the aspirations and the promise of the Puerto Ricans , listen to an intense young social worker named Antonia Pantoja . " I do n't laugh at the outlandish costumes of the new ones , " says Toni . " I arrived in a cotton suit , in November , and I swear to you that I had just three cents in my pocket . I had a skirt with flowers on it , and a borrowed coat . " Toni Pantoja took a quick dip in the melting pot and emerged with a healthy respect for her old and new cultures . She has brushed against intolerance . ( " It was quite a shock to discover you were supposed to be the lowest of the low . 1 used to cry every night . " ) But it has left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch the people who have the potential , " she says , " to see them flower and open up . We want to give them the realization that you can be what you are without being ashamed of it . We want to help our people to stand up and say , ' I am a Puerto Rican ! ' " In sharp contrast to Toni Pantoja 's viewpoint is that of Joseph Burger , a bearish man who employs almost 500 Puerto Ricans in his Bronx office-furniture plant . Burger does n't see " the Puerto Rican problem " as a repression of human dignity . " They come up here to eat , " he says . " They want jobs . Stop worrying about integrating them . Stop patronizing them . If you talk to the do-gooders and the social workers about the Puerto Ricans , you 're going to get suffocated with marshmallows . " In these days when two of our nation 's most pressing problems are racial integration and our inability to hold friends in the underdeveloped nations of the world , the Puerto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , He has what one church leader has called " a thoroughly Christian attitude toward the mixing of the races " ? and he offers a bridge between the hemispheres . It was significant that Vice President Nixon stopped to see Governor Mutioz at San Juan before returning to Washington from his stormy " good-will " tour of Latin America . Governor Munoz says this of the Puerto Rican 's contribution to the mainland : " When you meet a Puerto Rican in the streets of New York , Chicago , Los Angeles , or in the farms of New Jersey , Connecticut or Minnesota , no matter how unadapted he still may seem to his new environment , think of him as a member of a human group that is trying to be useful to freedom ; remember that there is a little more to him than meets the eye . Back in his Commonwealth he has a background of democracy , kindliness , a simple and sincere regard for his fellow beings  --  no matter of what race , color or station .
