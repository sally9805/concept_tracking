Nuclear power reactors are like bright college graduates : they have promise , but have not yet made any money . The first to do a real , paying job may be a small ( 10,000-kilowatt ) plant that was approved this week by the Atomic Energy Commission . Designed by Nuclear Development Corp . of America , it . will be built for the Chugach Electric Association of Anchorage , Alaska , where electric power is scarce and expensive . <P> The reactor will be of novel design , using heavy water as the moderator to slow down its neutrons , and liquid sodium as the coolant to extract the heat of the reaction . This combination is extremely efficient , but engineers have always shied away from it because water and liquid sodium react explosively when they come in contact . Only recently were methods devised to keep them safely apart . <P> One advantage of the design is that the sodium can become very hot without vaporizing . This eliminates high-pressure vessels and piping . Another advantage is that the fuel need be only slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that it can produce electricity at 7 mills per kilowatt-hour , which is much cheaper than the current cost ( 16.8 mills ) of steam power in the Anchorage area . <P> Larger models of the heavy water-sodium reactor ( 50,000 kilowatts and up ) can be fueled with natural uranium . This is an important advantage for sales outside the U.S. So far , the most efficient reactors have demanded enriched uranium , made only in the U.S. , Britain and Russia . Many countries want nuclear power , hate becoming dependent on the great powers for fuel . If they use natural uranium they can get fuel from many independent sources .
