A tired-eyed Texan named Henry Zweifel stepped off a train at Chicago 's Dearborn Station one day last week and took a yard-high , safelike steel filing case in tow . In the case , said Taftman Zweifel , were " more than 1,000 documents " to support his arguments that his Taft delegation from Texas should be seated in the Republican National Convention . He had watched over the case all night in his room on the train , he said , so no one would get away with the evidence . When word of Zweifel 's arrival with case and comment reached Houston , there was an immediate reaction from H. J. ( " Jack " ) Porter , head of the Eisenhower delegation from Texas . Said he : " The Taft forces could n't get enough documentation in the hold of the Queen Mary to justify their brazen steal of delegates in Texas . " <P> The Preliminaries . This front-of-curtain exchange between Texans Zweifel and Porter was a prologue to the drama which will occupy many of the Republicans ' hours in Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four other states . The first Chicago round of the battle began this week as the Republican National Committee started its deliberations on the contests . The committee will hold hearings and decide which delegates should be seated temporarily . Ikemen have reason to be concerned about the refereeing , for the national committee is solidly dominated by Taftmen . <P> The Ike side of the credentials fight is being managed by New York Lawyer Herbert Brownell , a Dewey man who was the Dewey-Warren campaign manager in 1948 . Working with Brownell is a staff of six lawyers , headed by William Pierce Rogers , onetime counsel for the Senate Investigations Committee ( among his cases : the five-percenters ) . Part of their assignment : to get their best witnesses before television cameras , as well as before the committee , so that the U.S. public would get the full impact of their case . <P> In most of the contests , the basic arguments are the same . The Eisenhower supporters charge that Taft-controlled party organizations are trying to steal delegate seats which Republican caucuses and conventions gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ike delegates were elected by interlopers , in many cases Democrats , who illegally took over Republican meetings . <P> Rule &; Custom . If the Ikemen lose the round before the pro-Taft national committee , they may throw their next punch on the floor of the convention within a few minutes after Republican Chairman Guy Gabrielson bangs the gavel for the first time . The Eisenhower campaign manager , Senator Henry Cabot Lodge , can move to change a rule and a precedent which have applied at Republican conventions since William Howard Taft 's steamroller ran down Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 . The rule : the temporary chairman decides whether contested delegations seated temporarily by the national committee should be permitted to vote on contests appealed to the floor of the convention . The precedent : contested delegates may vote on other contests , but not on those from their own states .
