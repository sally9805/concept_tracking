txt Current Democratic leadership plans are to bury Governor Furcolo 's proposed 3 per cent limited sales tax in the Massachusetts House on Thursday as quietly as possible . Unless plans are changed , the measure is due to come out of the House Committee on Ways and Means on Wednesday , either with a favorable or unfavorable report , with floor action scheduled the next day . Members of both parties are being freed by their leadership to vote as they see fit on the measure , which long ago was scheduled for the wastebasket because of heavy legislative opposition . Roll Call Weighed It is reliably reported that the Democratic leadership will seek to avoid a roll call vote on the issue , to give individual members a chance to " get off the hook " politically on the controversial issue . Representative Frank S. Giles ( R ) of Methuen . House Minority Leader . said today he will not press for a roll call unless scout ' of his party followers insist on one to enable them to vote against the measure for political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get rid of the measure at this session is by a voice vote . He said that some Republican businessmen and industrialists backing the sales tax have favored a roll call to get the members on record on the issue . While Daniel J. O'Connell , chief secretary to Governor Furcolo , claimed that Republican leaders originally had promised 50 Republican votes in the House for the sales tax , Mr. Giles said that such a promise never was made by Republican legislative leaders . The promise , he added . was made by Republican businessmen and others . Gw.oline Tax Hike Hit Legislators of both parties have reported strong public sentiment against the sales tax . particularly with the state budget balanced without new taxes this year .

Whether or not Governor Furcolo will renew his sales tax proposal in the 1960 election year remains to be seen . After his 1957 defeat by the House on the same issue , he failed to recommend the sales tax in the 1958 election year . Legislators always find it extremely difficult to vote new taxes in an election year because they then are operating under the ballot guns of the voters .
