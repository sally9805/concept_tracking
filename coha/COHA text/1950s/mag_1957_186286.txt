As the captains and the kings paraded on and off the stage in official Washington last week , one little scene-stealer grabbed his own private spotlight and held it right down to the last curtain . He was solemn little Prince Mashhur ibn Saud . 3 , son of the Saudi Arabian King , who had only to blink his liquid brown eyes to evoke cooings and mental chin-chucks across the nation . <P> The little prince had no sooner been lodged in President Eisenhower 's suite at Walter Reed Army Hospital , where Army doctors diagnosed his affliction-cerebral palsy-and prescribed special footwear and therapy ( TIME , Feb. 11 ) , than letters and gifts began pouring in to Blair House . The first grade at Nance School in Clinton , Okla. , wrote that they had seen him on television and wished him well . Kindergarten children in a Long Island public school spent the $1 surplus from their cookie fund for a couple of plastic toys , some crayons , a coloring book , lollipops and a jigsaw puzzle , sent them along to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corridors of the hospital he loped ( as best he could ) with his toy cowboy gun hanging from his hip . Back home at Blair House , there were cowboy and Indian suits , a drum , a road-scraper , a Mickey Mouse hat , a bicycle , lollipops , a toy tractor from the President . As if proof were needed that children are the same the world over , he presided at a children 's party at the Saudi Arabian embassy and started a typical childlike ruckus of his own . Photographers asked him . to kiss a little American girl , Mary Harris , granddaughter of U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia George Wadsworth . The prince tried to oblige , was repulsed . With that , Mashhur brandished a small fist , whacked the tearful girl on the shoulder , got his buss . <P> The week over , the Arabs prepared for their homeward trip . Somehow the presence of the somber child had taken the edge off much of the quibbling produced by the cautious politics and flaring passions that surrounded the King himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The proof , in a sense , lay in the two extra trunks bought in the U.S. by the Arabs , in which will be shipped the plastic toys and doodads that are gifts from American children .
