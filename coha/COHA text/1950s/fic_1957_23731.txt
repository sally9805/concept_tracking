A Story by ROBIN WHITE House of Many Rooms S ' H O R T L Y after the ox cart had passed the first village along the southeast route across the tip of India to Meigudy , Mrs. Fisher saw the little boy come running after her through the early morning shadows . A heavy mist lay close upon the ground , muffling the rumble of wooden wheels and obscuring the river and paddy fields so that the banyan trees which lined the road seemed to be rising out of a vast gray marsh of silence , penetrated remotely by the hooting of monkeys and the hoarse , insolent call of mynah birds and crows . Out of this silence the child emerged without warning as if , like some spirit of the dark hours , the figment of Mrs. Fisher 's imagination , he had been conspiring to overtake her unawares . Her immediate response was one of mild annoyance at the intrusion . The boy had broken so abruptly upon her entranced solitude as to startle her , and at first she turned stiffly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threadbare cloth , he might have been around six , Mrs. Fisher thought , although he looked to be not more than four . His hair was red brown from the dust caked in it , his dark skin an ashy hue for need of a bath , and his features seemed pinched , almost distorted , by hunger and the wearing effects of having to fend for himself too early in life . Mrs. Fisher had learned to read these signs , and their meaning turned her surprise into sudden fear ; for just by his appearance and the way he trailed her she could tell he wasa stray  --  the dangerous type that would try , if possible , to become attached to her . Resolutely she turned away and focused her attention on her hands . Much as she loved children , strays were definitely not included in her plans for this trip . By degrees mustering up courage , the boy moved in closer to the bandy . Mrs. Fisher knew he was not going to be easily shaken . She tried not to look at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticing how dreadfully stony and unchanging was the mask of his face . Her heart was torn with pity ; only she was afraid that if she revealed any of this the boy would use it to attach himself to her . " Begone , child , " she said in Tamil , waving the boy away . Immediately she realized that , unwittingly or by desire , she had made a mistake , done the very thing that would bring the hoy to her . By showing that she had noticed hiin , she had openly acknowledged her concern . Taking bean , he pressed in close to the bandy . He did not try to speak to her , and Mrs. Fisher knew this was another bad sign . If he had asked for food or money , it would have meant he was a beggar child who would leave as soon as he got what he wanted . So preoccupied was she with thinking about the boy that she did not sec the man on horseback until he had overtaken the bandy and , unable to pass because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slowed to a pace behind . He was a well-dressed , middle-aged man , tall , strikingly handsome and arrogantdooking , and apparently Mohammedan , because he carried a prayer mat . Seeing Mrs. Fisher 's anxious glance in the boy 's direction , he reined back and drew his impatient , high-strung stallion around sideways to the handy . " Madame , " he said in English , saluting , " is this filthy urchin causing you annoyance ? " " What ? Oh , no , no , " Mrs. Fisher said , collecting herself quickly . " Not really . " " Only permit me to be of service , Madame , and I shall gladly drive him off . " He unstrung a bull whip from his saddle and turned as if to lash out at the child . " Please , " Mrs. Fisher said . " It 's quite all right . Do n't strike him . " She raised her hand in protest , annoyed at having been put in the position of defending the boy . At the sight of the whip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " See , " she said , " he does n't want to cause any trouble . " " Very well , Madame , if you say . " The Mohammedan curled the whip back into place . " But if I may be so bold as to advise , Madame would do well not to encourage him by any sign or word . As a merchant I have had much experi ? ence with all types of beggars . It is the little ones like this who seek a home that are most danger . ous . They are filled with vermin , and for sheer persistence they can not he excelled . " " I know , " Mrs. Fisher agreed without enthusiasm . " One can not be too careful . " " I see that Madame has been wisened by ex-perience . " " Yes , I 've taken in a few in my time , " she said , thinking of the several stray children she had mothered in the past . " The worst of it is they all grow up and go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthless lot . " " I would n't say that exactly , " Mrs. Fisher said . " It 's just that they find lives of their own after a while , and for a person of my age it is difficult to live through fondness and departure . " " Then Madame is ? truly charitable , " the Mohammedan said . " I myself can not undertake to provide for more than my own . " " Do you have many children ? " she asked , wondering at his almost militant self-interest . " Five , Madame  --  all sons , praise be to Allah . And Madame ? " " Three , " said Mrs. Fisher . " I had four at one time  --  three boys and a girl . A sufficient average , I suppose . My eldest son was drowned in a flood , much like this . " She nodded in the direction of the swollen river , now visible beyond the trees . " My deepest sympathies , Madame . " " It 's all right , " Mrs. Fisher said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And where are Madame 's children now ? " " Oh , they all have homes in America . It was n't so bad when my husband was still living . But now , sometimes I  --  well , I have my mission work , and that keeps me busy . I 've lived in India so long 1 would n't know what to do in another cou n try . " F 0 R a moment the Mohammedan studied her silently , taking in her age , her lavender sari , and the easy way she rode cross-legged on the rough floor boards of the cart . " May I ask where Madame travels dressed in Indian garb and riding in a bandy ? " " To Meigudy , " she said . Then seeing his questioning glance she added , " It was my home for many years  --  and happy years they were , too . Mr. Fisher and I went there in a covered wagon like this , when we were first married , to reorganize the mission . It 's always seemed like home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Mohammedan was instantly touched by this . " And now Madame is returning to recapture the old memories . Ah , such poetry ! such significance ! a pilgrimage to the scene of one 's youth ! . I shall compose a poem about it the instant I reach home . " " That 's nice , " said Mrs. Fisher . But somehow she did n't feel any poetry . It was as if by revealing the purpose of her trip , by putting the thought in words , the whole idea had suddenly taken on an unpleasant air , reminding her of a dream she often had of a house with many rooms . Every time the dream occurred , she would find herself , fully aware that she was asleep , entering a house with the familiar , almost useless feeling that she had seen it all before , knew every crack and cranny of the place ; yet to her amazement every time she passed through the house , she would discover new and more beautiful rooms . And when she would finally awaken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been cut off from an unfinished task . Restlessly now , her eyes wandered from the Mohammedan 's horse to the little boy , trailing at a distance . Overjoyed by the thought of the poem , the Mohammedan began composing lines of it in snatches and out loud . He even offered Mrs. Fisher his company for the rest of the trip , saying it was dangerous for women to travel alone in these parts . But she told him that she had often traveled alone and that it would be a shame to hold him up unnecessarily . To this the Mohammedan agreed , and after he had thanked Mrs. Fisher for his pleasant conversation with her , he saluted and rode ahead , giving a final brandish of the whip in the boy 's direction . P RESENTLY the bandy lurched down a short embankment to ford a shallow channel . The brown , swiftly-moving flood water surged against the wheels , and the oxen came to a standstill . The slumbering driver , who had nearly fallen from his seat , leaped up to prod some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle , biting their tails and crying , " Haaai ! Hai ! Eeeeya ! " As they came up 01110 the far bank , the first rays of the rising sun penetrated and divided the mist into patches like flocks of sheep . On either side of the road clusters of low , thatched huts appeared , and Mrs. Fisher knew they had reached the second village . Here the bandy overtook a group of Hindu women . Mrs. Fisher could hear their loud early-morning laughter long before the slow-moving ox cart caught up with them , and from their conversation she knew they were headed for a wedding . They were all dressed in their best saris , their hair washed and combed and braided with gay white and yellow flowers ; and their laughter betrayed them . The only time village women were free from work and had time to be happy was on a wedding day . As the bandy slowly passed them , the women stopped talking momentarily until they caught sight of Mrs. Fisher . Of one accord they quickened their leisurely holiday pace to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their immediate presence directly behind the bandy would , under any other circumstances , have been a source of delight to Mrs. Fisher . She had always enjoyed the frank , unassuming manner of villagewomen when their husbands were not around . But moving in such numbers and so close to the bandy they blocked her view of the little boy , thus heightening her concern for him . All at once she felt irritated by their laughter . Not realizing that she spoke Tamil , the women began conversing freely about Mrs. Fisher , wondering why she was dressed in a sari and why she rode a bandy instead of taking the bus or train . " Maybe she speaks Tamil , " someone suggested . " Never , " asserted another loudly . " White ? ladies ca n't . Their tongues are n't made right for it . Too stiff . Have n't you noticed how they always speak with their teeth . They prefer to bite words . It comes of eating meat . " " You never can tell about these white ladies , " someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like appearing in public with strange men . It 's all on account of education . That 's what I say . " There was a murmur of agreement from the group , and the conversation branched out into a general discussion and condemnation of the sinful ways of educated city women . " After all , " someone remarked , " what else is there in life but bard work mixed in with weddings , births , funerals , and maybe a good fight or two ? One can only accept these things and appease the gods . Give a woman a book and she goes to pot . " Accept ? Mrs. Fisher said to herself . Was that where the answer lay ? Accept ? Accept what ? Loneliness ? Confusion ? Defeat ? Where then was there room for hope ? It seemed to her that she had accepted so much that she was at cross-purposes with herself . She did not even know these women , and yet , whether she accepted them or not , they had insinuated themselves into her life , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . She kept straining to see over their heads and finally , thinking that he had dropped out of sight altogether , she called impatiently for the women to step aside . They complied readily enough , surprise registered on their faces . The boy was still following . Far from being embarrassed by the discovery that Mrs. Fisher spoke Tamil , the women now pressed around her , anxious to please , anxious to learn the answers to their questions . With a renewed sense of humor , Mrs. Fisher yielded to them , explaining her reasons for riding in a bandy and wearing a sari . When they asked how old she was , they were amazed to learn that she was nearly sixty . Why , she was a grandmother , they exclaimed , calling her respectfully " Parti . " She was older than anyone in the group yet , see , she looked to be not more than forty at the most . Their words buoyed Mrs. Fisher up , and for a while she was cheered to the point of laughter . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch them , each in turn placed a rough forefinger on Mrs. Fisher 's leg . How far up did they go ? they asked , all the way ? Mrs. Fisher was fortunately spared further interrogation and exploration by the ox cart 's timely arrival at the third village where the wedding was being held . The women abruptly bid her farewell and rushed ahead to join the throng gathered outside one of the huts where a pavilion of thatch had been erected . Because of the crowd , the driver had to climb out onto the yoke to break passage . Although Mrs. Fisher leaned out , she was unable to catch a glimpse of the bride and groom , and when the ox cart finally left the village , she sat back wondering how the women could live simply on the basis of accepting life and relieving its hardships by the amusement of social functions . The very thought of it had a disquieting effect on her . Now , although she tried , she could no longer make herself feel the desperateness of purpose that had forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little boy , she searched the road for some sign of him . He would probably give up following her , she thought , for the more promising prospects of the wedding and handouts of food . But she found no joy in that . B Y DEGREES the rising sun forced Mrs. Fisher back under the wagon cover . Traffic had increased along the road , and front time to time the bandy was slowed by encounters with herds of cattle , long lines of coolies , and the caravans of ox carts laden with great bales of hemp and cotton . In the open stretches she could look back on the fields where people worked in bunches , women bent over planting , men cultivating with wooden plows drawn by lethargic black water buffaloes , boys running treadmills that raised water from one irrigation ditch to another . Then there were the monkeys that chased each other along the ground , and in the distance flocks of teal dipped and soared over the fields . Sometimes the road was flooded and boys would be swimming in the brown water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast groves of coconut and palmyra palms , and the sudden deep shade with its accompanying hollow silence would come as a cool refreshing drink . There had been a time when the cumulative effect of this changing landscape had filled her with peace and a sense of belonging . But now the monotony of sound and movementmade her feel lonely and dissatisfied , and all at once she knew she could not go on like this , not knowing what was happening to the boy . Frantically she called for the driver to stop and pull over . It was time for lunch anyway , she argued . Stiffly she unfolded herself from the bandy and got down while the driver unhitched the oxen and led them over to the side of the road to graze . Taking her tiffin carrier in one hand , she sat down on a large hump formed by the root of a banyan tree . On the right the road was edged by a dense shola of palm trees , and on the left the land dipped sharply down to the river . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ napkin on the grass , she was startled to discover that her spot was shared by a . Sannyasi , a holy man , sitting on a reed mat near the banyan and contemplating infinity . Now there , she thought , looking at him , was freedom . And yet it occurred to her that withdrawal was not exactly freedom , and avoidance was not exactly happiness . It only created an effect , and even the Sannyasi had to make concessions to life : he had to eat and breathe , and some day he had to die . The more she thought about it , the more it disturbed her . She tried to eat , but the food would not go down , and after a while she began putting it back in the tiffin carrier . Her worry for the little boy nauseated her , and when he appeared , walking up the road in her direction , she felt such a tightness in her stomach that she thought she was going to be sick . At the sight of the food , the little boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He squatted on his hams and watched her , and she , resigning herself to the inevitable , held out a brass tumbler of milk to him . He took it and downed it swiftly , furtively . The least I can do , she thought , is feed him . If I give him food perhaps he will be satisfied and go his way . She handed him a package of sandwiches and a cup cake , trying not to watch as , in his eagerness , he ate the cake with the paper on it . " What arc you called , child ? " she asked when he had finished . " Krishnan , " the boy said in a voice that sounded dead and old . Are you from these parts ? " The boy shrugged and Mrs. Fisher could not keep from asking , " Have you no relatives to look after you , no home to go to ? " Even before he gave it , she knew the answer . " I am alone , Amma . " Alone ? So alone then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her despite her fierce sup-pression of them . She was yielding unnecessarily . And if she lost her will to shut him out , would he then not become a part of her life and grow up and leave her like all the others ? like all that she had ever cared for and loved ? In that moment she admired the Mohammedan 's ability to take what he- wanted and drive off what he did not without suffering the agony of doubt ; she admired the village women and envied their yielding ability to accept what came to them ; she even admired the old Sannyasi for his complete indifference . Anything , she said to herself , would be better than what I now feel . Abruptly she rose , thinking that now the child would go and leave her in peace , free of the responsibility of making a decision about him . Yet in a way she almost hoped that he would force the decision on her . As if he knew what she was thinking , he rose and followed her over to where the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of determination , Mrs. Fisher stepped on the foot rail to get in , but even as she did so , her knees weakened and she knew she did not have the strength to let the boy walk on those spindly , worn legs of his . He was so young , so frail , so alone , so innocent , and in his very weakness too strong for her . " Oh , damn ! oh , damn you , Sannyasi ! " she said , trying to pinch back the words with one hand across her mouth . " Well , get in boy . You will ride with me . " She stepped back and motioned for him to climb up without touching her . She did not want him to touch her , for somehow the thought of contact made her afraid . The boy did as he was told , and Mrs. Fisher climbed in after him , telling herself that she was taking him with her only because he was so small , and that she would turn him over to the mission orphanage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcrowded at the orphanage already , she knew , but She would take some of her savings and make a little fund for his care . That was as far as it would go . He was not going to push his way into her life  --  not under any circumstances would she go through all that again . And as if to make certain of this she said , " I want no misunderstanding , child . I 'm taking you to Meigudy , and when we return to the city I will put you in the orphanage where they 'll educate , feed and clothe you . But that 's all , mind , that 's as much as I can do . " Then she realized that he had said nothing , made no demands of her , and that her words had been spoken only for her own benefit . I simply had to do something , she thought . With him tailing me like that I was constantly distracted . Now I wo n't have to worry or think about him . " And just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you 're filthy and I wo n't have it . " Within minutes after the bandy got under way the boy fell asleep , exhausted , on the straw cushioning . Only then did Mrs. Fisher feel free to turn and study him , as if , had he been conscious and known she was looking , it would have harmed or weakened her in some way . T H E N quite suddenly the ox cart was overtaken by a student on a bicycle . He came riding impetuously around a curve , nearly bumping into the bandy before he saw it . Mrs. Fisher could tell he was a student because he wore his vashti in what was called the " Rumba Regent " style . The style was popular on campuses around South India and involved knotting the vashti on the side instead of in front , twisting the belt off center , too . The young man was perspiring heavily and took this chance encounter with the bandy to slacken his pace . Mrs. Fisher could see that he was anxious to catch onto the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing that a white lady rode within , he was not quite sure what to do . Mrs. Fisher nodded and smiled , and instantly his left hand snapped out to catch the side of the bandy . He back-pedaled fancily , like a young acrobat giving out with the footwork before actually stepping on the tight wire . Then he released his hold of the handle bars and performed a flashy series of one-handed maneuvers with cigarette and match . Inhaling , he peered boldly into the bandy at Mrs. Fisher . He eyed her sari , her tali ; he peered at the slumbering little boy ; and finally , after he had made certain with deliberate and affected casualness that there was no more to be seen , he asked , " Madame is married to an Indian man ? " " No , " Mrs. Fisher said . He was visibly disappointed . " Perhaps Madame is only married in form to a European and is having an affair with an Indian . " Mrs. Fisher shook her head , in doubt as to whether she should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the young man said . " Why do you ride in a bandy ? Where are you going dressed in this manner ? And why is your son so Indian-looking ? " Mrs , Fisher explained . " Oh , a missionary lady , " he said , dejected . " Such a wretched business . I had thought for a moment that you were one of us . " " Aixl what might that be ? " Mrs. Fisher asked . " One of the new set , " the young man replied . " We believe in complete abolition of all social , moral , and religious bonds due to the fact that they are largely invented by pettyfoggers to hinder and restrict the free movement of the intellectual . I feel that man should be free to behave exactly as he pleases . For instance , have you ever thought of the daily tragedy of many men and women who are kept from meeting each other and making love by such trite restrictions as decorum ? Absence of free love is a tragedy . Absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have you ever thought of that ? People should be able simply to meet , make love , and separate without attachment . We live in a terrible world of rules , Madame , truly terrible , you know ? And every generation adds more to the list . " T HE young man had not yet had time to catch his breath completely , and as he spoke with an amazing machine-like rapidity he was soon winded to the point of speechlessness . Mrs. Fisher frowned and turned to look at Krishnan . She wanted to ask the young man where there was room in his philosophy for children , but he anticipated her . " Take this stray urchin , for instance . You do not really want him along , but you have picked him up out of charity . And what is charity ? A foolish manifestation of social coercion . You feel obliged to do what you have done . You do not want to do it . And what good does it do the boy , MAGAZINE I ask you ? Now he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he will lose that precious freedom that was his . " " Freedom from what ! " Mrs. Fisher almost shouted . But the student did not hear her . At that moment they passed a young woman standing beside the road and drying her sari . She had apparently just come from washing her sari in the river , and , it being her only garment , she was drying it , the way village women did , by tying one end to a post and wrapping the other tightly about her body . The sun , however , had made her slightly dozy , and as the bandy rolled past , a sudden breath of hot air caught her sari from her relaxed grasp and whipped it away from her , revealing , for one instant before she could recover her senses and snatch the cloth modestly around her , all the warm , sensual contours of her ripe young body . " There ! " the student shouted excitedly . ' ' That is what I mean exactly ! Here for a moment we have a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty  --  the ultimate in life  --  and what happens ? She jumps like one possessed in order to cover it up . Why ? Because the rules say so . Because of the rules she deprives the world of one moment of realization and makes of it a thing of shame . She covers herself up . " " And so would have I , " Mrs. Fisher snapped . The young man shrugged . " Ah , well . It is to be expected . But for a moment I had thought that perhaps you were one of us and had cast off societal bonds to take up with an Indian . " " I 'm sorry to have disappointed you , " she said . " Quite all right , " the young man said , overlooking her sarcasm and brushing her words aside as if he were bestowing a favor . " We ca n't hope for everyone to be saved . New tricks can not be learned to an old dog , you know . " He paused and looked around for a new approach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " For the same reason you do n't , " she said . " Are you also penniless and unemployed ? " " I simply wish to ride this way , " she said . " When I first came to Meigudy as a young woman , I went by ox cart . And now that I 'm going back I want to do it the same way . " She wished she had n't said that . She did n't owe him an explanation , and his reply stung her . " Such a trite sentiment utterly , Madame , " he said . " I exhort you to purge yourself of these feelings . One must never become attached to the past because it constitutes a hindrance to the present . Simply because you are along in years is no excuse to let yourself he shackled by sentimental attachments to the past or to the nuisance of that child . Strike them off , Madame , while there is time . " Before Mrs. Fisher could hurl back an indignant reply , the young man pedaled off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her mouth . " But it 's all I 've got , " she said , choking back the words . " It 's all I 've got . " From the changing landscape , she could tell they were at last nearing Meigudy ; her irritation gave way to mounting tension . On the outskirts of town the bandy passed an old woman struggling along the road . Mrs. Fisher took compassion on her , perhaps through some association of age , and invited her to ride with them . The old woman climbed into the bandy gratefully and cupped her tired feet in her hands . The flesh had withered on her arms and legs , and her face was heavily seamed with wrinkles that puckered the flesh about her toothless old gums as if at one time the lips had been sewn together like a wound . She wore a faded sari , her white hair looked quite lifeless , her eyes devoid of any curious gleam . Mrs. Fisher tried to picture herself that old , wondering what answer so many years of living had taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Fisher asked in Tamil . " Even so , " the old woman replied . " My youngest son lives there with his children , and my old bones have an ache to see him again . " " I suppose you live near by  --  I mean near enough to make the walk once in a while . " " Yes , I live in the city , " the old woman said . " In the city ! " Mrs. Fisher exclaimed . " That 's a good thirty miles from Meigudy . " " A good thirty , " the old woman said . " In my younger days I could make it from sunrise to sunset . Now , alas , the weight of years is upon me and I must start a day in advance . " " But is it worth all that ? " " Worth ? Worth ? Amma , when I have an ache to see my son and his children , the question of worth does not come into my mind . What else is there to life but children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I say . And you , Amma , do you go to Meigudy ? " Mrs. Fisher nodded . " To visit family , or friends ? " " Neither , " said Mrs. Fisher . " But if you go not to visit with someone and have no family with you , what is the purpose of your trip ? " " I make a pilgrimage , " Mrs. Fisher explained , " to my old home . " " And no family lives there ? " " No . " The old woman shook her head . Mrs. Fisher tried to explain , but the old woman was unable to fathom her reasoning . " All that sort of thing is beyond me , Amma . It is unnatural for one to be attached to a place where no relatives live . " Her words drew Mrs. Fisher 's mounting frustration out to a fine , biting edge . " It 's the most natural thing in the world to me ! " " Please forgive , " the old woman said . " I am an ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer matter to me . I have only an ache to see my children and my children 's children before time is upon me and carries me down with its weight . " Mrs. Fisher opened and closed her mouth several times without a word . She was thunderstruck to learn that this old woman was actually younger than herself . Somehow she had looked upon her as older and more wise , forgetting how many Indian women were aged so early by hard work , and the realization of this bore down on her like a great stone on the back of her neck . At the bridge the old woman uttered her thanks and left . Mrs. Fisher was still too stunned to think . With dreadful slowness the bandy crept through the streets of Meigudy , past the bazaars and market square , the familiar places crowded with strange young faces , and across town to the old mission compound . Mrs. Fisher was afraid to look out as they swung right over the little bridge and up through the gate to the drive that meandered under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untended gardens to the bungalow . Every turn , every rut , every hump in the road now had the painful touch of familiarity , and Mrs. Fisher could feel her heart quicken to a pounding , unbearable crescendo . Then the bandy came to a stop , the bullocks snorting from the final sprint the driver had put them through , and Mrs. Fisher 's throat went dry as she turned to climb out . T HAD been her plan to dismiss the bandy and stay overnight in the bungalow , returning the next day by train or bus . But somehow the moment of fulfillment was as far away as ever , and she knew it had been too late and too hopeless from the start . As she looked up at the bungalow , she could sec that everything about it had changed . While it remained much the same in outline  --  the spacious verandas , the red-tiled roof , the arched porticoes  --  the insidious fingernails of time had picked mercilessly over everything , pulling down the vines and trellises , scratching off the plaster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shredding the wood- ? work . Deadness and ruin lay over the place , exuding the stifling oppression of heat . Almost mechanically Mrs. Fisher forced herself to climb the steps and enter the front room . The key she had taken the trouble to secure from the mission secretary was quite useless because the doors were in such bad repair that . it had been an easy thing for someone to break in before her arrival . In mounting torment she passed through one room after another . She knew these rooms  --  they were the scenes of birth and death , happiness and sorrow and anger  --  all that meant anything to her had been encompassed by these crumbling walls  --  and yet in a way she did not know them and they were strange to her . The life that had once filled and made real this empty shell had long since fled . Remembering the plaque she had had inscribed with the 127th Psalm , she went into the dining room and dusted away the wall where it was , nearly obliterated : Lo , children are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the womb Man 's reward , As arrows in the hands of a warrior So are the children of one 's youth . Happy is he that hath a quiver of them ; For he shall not be put to shame When he meets with his enemies in the gate . The sight drew from Mrs. Fisher a sharp cry of anguish , and , crushed with her own loneliness , she turned and fled from the house . She would never be able to bear the feeling of this place overnight ; for as it was now it had no attachment for her . In haste she gathered the awakened little Krishnan up into the bandy and told the surprised driver to take them to the station at once . He complied , bewildered , and in a moment they were on the road again . Mrs. Fisher sat with her head bowed and looked at the road unfolding slowly beneath her like a gravel ribbon from a spool that was the axle of the bandy . It seemed to her , looking at the road , that all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life that had been unfolding beneath her . She had been riding not into the past , as she had supposed , but away from it . She had started out a young woman , young in hope , and now , unsuspectingly , age had crept up on her to strike its heavy blow . Feeling Krishnan 's hand on her arm , she turned to him sharply . " Well , what is it , boy , what is it ? " " Recess , Amma , " he said . Almost hatefully she called for the driver to stop while the boy got out and went to the bathroom . Apparently the call had been urgent , and Mrs. Fisher was annoyed that he had not spoken sooner . " Well , hurry up , hurry up ! " she snapped furiously as he came back to the bandy . Her MAGAZINE anger made him hesitate , afraid to get in . Suddenly all the pain and futility seemed to sweep to the fore of Mrs. Fisher 's mind , focusing on the boy . If the trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Yes , she could blame every last bit on him because it was his fault . " Oh , for heaven 's sake , child , get in ! " she yelled . He stood crouching to one side , still afraid , and for the first time his somber face crumpled to reveal emotion : silently he wept . Mrs. Fisher looked at him in surprise as if she had not really seen him before . His pants were wet slightly where he had not gone to the bathroom soon enough because she had not thought to let him go .
