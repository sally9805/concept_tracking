Artists and critics alike have long accused Manhattan 's mighty Metropolitan Museum of slighting contemporary U.S. art . This week the Met atoned for its former coolness with a show that surveyed the field exhaustively , and exhaustingly as well . No less than 6,248 painters had submitted works for the exhibition . To get the widest possible spread of work and judgment , the Met had appointed regional juries in Dallas , Santa Barbara , Richmond , Chicago and Manhattan . The regional juries rejected all but 761 ; then a national jury cut the total down to 307-more than enough to constitute a full report on the state of the nation 's art . <P> Warm Milk . Room One contained four paintings for which the Met had awarded $8,500 in prizes . The awards were all safe as warm milk ; granted to men who had won many prizes before , they ran the gamut from watered-down abstractionism to souped-up realism . Basket Bouquet , an impeccable and wholly uninspiring arrangement of lilac smudges by Cape Cod Abstractionist Karl Knaths , took first prize . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , translated into the smeary medium of oils . California 's Rico Lebrun came in second with Centurion 's Horse , a chalky , Picassoid nag , understandably hanging its head in a canvas as dark and narrow as a hall closet . <P> Third prize went to Manhattan 's Yasuo Kuniyoshi , whose works sometimes have the taste and balance of good Oriental art . His shrill , finicky Fish Kite did not . Joseph Hirsch 's fourth-prizewinning view of Nine Men in a men's-room mirror was as skillfully done as anything in the show , and as dour . Hirsch had caught the cold light reflected from glass and white tiling , dramatically illuminated the begrimed and weary workmen cleaning up in its glare . <P> The Met-appointed juries were on the conservative side , a fact which had led 28 advance-guard abstractionists to boycott the show ( TIME , June 5 ) . Possibly to rebut the allegation that they were just old fuddy-duddies , the jurors toppled over backward , chose whole roomfuls of alfalfa-dry , determinedly subjectless and mostly meritless efforts by the Academy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was provided by a few comparatively young and little-known painters with a sense of self . Honolulu 's Ben Norris translated mountains into a jagged , energetic shorthand that almost soared . Boston 's Lawrence Kupferman reduced a tide-pool to a rich swirling pattern that looked like yellow marble . <P> Warm Ashes . If the abstractionists were mostly dry , the more traditional painters were soggy . Even the much-admired ones often succeeded by mere competence . Henry Koerner 's blend of banality and obscurity , Fire on the Beach , was an ashen canvas warmed by brilliant drawing alone . John Koch 's The Monument was curious in content and cottony in color , but it had a complexity and depth of composition that few moderns could bring off . Isabel Bishop 's Nude Bending ( one of the show 's few nudes ) was so dimly painted it looked like a fading wraith , but its every line and highlight was placed precisely right .
