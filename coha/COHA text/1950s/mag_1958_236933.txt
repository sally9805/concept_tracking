The West hardened its positions and its tone in dealings with the Russians last week . Items : <P> Strategic Air Command . The U.S. mowed down in one day 's U.N . Security Council debate the U.S.S.R. 's propaganda charges against " provocative " SAC flights over the Arctic ( TIME , April 28 ) , mustered up such a huge majority ( possibly nine to one ) that the U.S.S.R. withdrew the complaint . Then the U.S. called on the U.N . Security Council to reopen debate on the U.S. proposal , rejected by the U.S.S.R. last summer , for an Arctic " open skies " inspection zone . <P> The Summit . The U.S. , Britain and France fired off a joint note to the Kremlin opposing the U.S.S.R. 's attempt to divide the allies in pre-summit talks by seeing Western ambassadors separately , suggested that the U.S.S.R. see the ambassadors together and start work on a summit agenda . <P> The U.S.S.R. hardened its line on summit talks , too . One day last week the Kremlin 's Khrushchev sent a bitter letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint technical studies on disarmament , adding a new attack on nuclear tests " causing an ever-present and ever-mounting danger to the health and life of the people . . . from radiation hazards . " President Eisenhower prodded right back that K. really ought to begin technical studies : " I am unhappy that valuable time is now being wasted . " <P> The hardening Western line reflected suspicions of new unrest behind the Iron Curtain in general and within the Kremlin hierarchy in particular ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) . The hardening line also reflected sober second thought from London to Seoul about what reducing the power of the free world 's deterrent might mean . <P> Britain 's Prime Minister Harold Macmillan , committed to summit talks if diplomats can agree on an agenda , felt strong enough in terms of British public opinion to launch an attack against the Labor Party 's line on nuclear tests . " What prevents war , " he said , " is the balance of power . Peace has been preserved thus far not because the West has been disarmed but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like to be responsible for the outcome if we were to abandon the balance . " Said the New York Times : " The Soviet strategy emphasizes again Moscow 's real aims and exposes the naivet of those who , undaunted by the failure to win Stalin 's cooperation after the last war by giving him all he wanted , now propose to win Khrushchev 's cooperation by offering him nuclear disarmament , ' disengagement ' and the status quo.
