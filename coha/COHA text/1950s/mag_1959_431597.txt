 | THE PRETTY AMERICANS how Wives behave Overseas They often make or break their husbands ' careers ? and U. S. foreign policy as well . A practical guide to overseasmanship , based on a study of some of the 250,000 American women now stationed abroad . ABOUT a quarter of a million American wives are now living abroad with husbands who work for our government , business firms , churches , and foundations . The way they live has suddenly become a matter of national concern . What happens to an air base , an aid program , or a missionary school may largely depend on them . You would never guess this truth from reading the growing shelf of popular books about Americans overseas . Phuong , the woman in Graham Greene 's The Quiet American , is neither American nor married . And only one very untypical wife strays into the all-male picture of American bumbling and heroism drawn by William J. Lederer and Eugene Burdick in The Ugly American , a current best seller . At Syracuse University we have been trying to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseas assignments . The answer often is deceptively simple : their wives . In the course of our study we have talked to many of them in a dozen countries ? and we find that both public and private agencies operating abroad often underestimate the power of a woman . It is not enough , we find , to select and train the right man for a job overseas . For his wife will usually make at least half of the family 's decision on going ; she will cast the deciding vote on whether to stay ; and in many cases she will make or break her husband 's career . F E W wives hesitate to pull up stakes . In dozens of interviews , we found only one who had actively resisted the idea . Apart from the financial inducements ? which are well advertised and impressive ? the most powerful lures are the pull of exotic places , and an eagerness to get out of a familiar rut . " Escape " has come to be a bad word recently ? but in fact it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often fugitives  | from sixth-grade arithmetic ; plenty of boys have fled from marginal farms to become city leaders ; writers and politicians are sometimes frustrated teachers or businessmen who got bored with office routine . It may be true , as one of the psychologists working on our study says , that " If you are maladjusted at home , you 'll be even more maladjusted abroad . " But one of the most successful directors of an American aid mission in Asia is an escapee from maladjustment . He inherited a Southern farm , managed it for years with increasing dislike , and finally sold out to get into the international field ? spurred by his wife who had always been fascinated by missionary work . And one can only applaud the " escape motivation " of an architect who left Manhattan to design buildings for the Indonesian government . " Why are you here ? " I asked his wife . " ' yell , " she said , " one year we just got tired of designing showrooms for brassieres ! " Having " escaped , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fabulous temples ? but into unguided " coping " with exotic plumbing and indigestible food . She and her husband are both hit hard by culture shock , the sudden realization that their own ways are merely relative . But the husband 's jolt is cushioned by the comfortable continuity of his profession ? he spends most of his time soldiering , engineering , teaching , or whatever he was doing at home . It is the wife who must transplant family life to new surroundings , build new friendships , adjust to dirt and heat , worry about health and schools , and try to learn a strange tongue in two or three distracted hours a week . For most , the adventure is fun ? and there is plenty of social pressure to rise to challenges that do n't seem funny until you look back on them later . An American girl is constantly reminded ( sometimes pointedly by the boss 's wife ) that she is now a " good-will ambassador . " " It 's bad taste to complain , " a successful Foreign Service wile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fly got in my butter . Now I do n't fuss as long as I can find some butter among the flies ! " The typical American woman seems to adjust readily to an oversupply of servants and a shortage of almost everything else . She can accommodate herself to drafty houses in a European winter , or to permanent perspiration in an equatorial summer . She is used to making new friends ? young Americans are migratory at home too . Servants present a delicate problem , but diligent research has yet to uncover a single American wife who could n't get used to having some help around the house . She also learns readily to boil the water and to ignore greasy spoons . Such things , in fact , are seldom mentioned even as minor annoyances after a few months . And she soon becomes adept at ordering meals and chit-chatting at parties in a combination of basic English , enthusiastic smiles , expressive gestures , and a smattering of cliches in the local vernacular . These changes the American trite takes in her stride . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear of disease , the chronic worry about schooling for the children , and the frustrating effort to cross the cultural barrier . " IS THERE A DOCTOR IN THE COUNTRY ? ' ' Y 0 U R blood gets thin . " ' ' You get that tired feeling . " Such complaints are as common among the overseas Americans as they are in TV commercials at home . In sultry sea-level Djakarta. in dusty Belgrade , irr New Delhi on India 's inland plain , in Addis Ababa a mile high on a sparkling plateau , there is universal testimony that " people just have less energy than they would have at home " ? though the blame is variously placed on the heat , the humidity , the altitude , or the plum brandy . In all the countries of Asia , Africa , and Latin America , Americans are plagued by the " turisticos , " the minor @#  | dysentery which seems to attack careful eaters and ignorant gluttons alike . Yet once the pace is slowed down ( in the tropics even Americans can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. families do n't have much more illness abroad than at home . It is the threat rather than the reality that bothers the overseas wife . She dreads what would happen if a serious illness struck . Everywhere there is alleged to be a lack of adequate doctors and hospitals ? their adequacy being measured by their American-ness . When it comes to taking care of their children American mothers want American doctors . In Ethiopia , for instance , the impulse is to rush anyone really ill to the U. S. Army hospital at Frankfurt ? a greater distance than from San Francisco to New York . Even in Brussels , serious illness sends Americans scurrying across the German border to the nearest American hospital . As with health , so with schools : if it 's not American , it 's not good enough , and most wives expect the U. S. to maintain an " educational PX " around the world , from kindergarten through twelfth grade . Rare exceptions are the American children put into " indigenous " schools ? in New Delhi , only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chester Bowles ' children who attended Indian schools . A few hardy souls tutor their own children until they find that doubling as parent and teacher does n't work very well . One mother insisted her daughter call her " Mrs. Jones " during class hours . " It 's pretty hard to keep up that pretense , " she confessed . " What do you do when your pupil suddenly hugs you and says , Oh , Mummy , I love you . Let 's stop now ' ? " The British , who preceded us on every continent , were happy to , ship their children home to boarding school at the age of nine or ten . But we are peculiar people . We insist on keeping our children with us ? even if we have to import our school system along with our baby food and sour mash bourbon . On four continents during the last fifteen years : merican wives by the thousands have thrown themselves into the effort to meet the educaional needs created by their own expectations . An excellent school was created in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energetic wives of men in the Allied occupation forces , the American Embassy , and UN relief program . There is another in Taiwan , where more than 10,000 Americans share the island with 10 million Chinese . On most military posts , . the Army or BY HARLAN CLEVELAND 33 Air Force maintains an American-style school ; the Air Force , indeed , is now said to run the largest single school system in the world . In Latin America , a whole string of American schools has grown up in response to , a generation of demand ; the expanding American communities in Asia and Africa are demanding something similar . In many places there is an " International School , " financed mostly by American families , where the American " Calvert System " is taught by British teachers ( because they do n't cost as much as our underpaid American teachers ) . WHAT TO DO WITH TEEN-AGERS I N MOST places , the school problem is somehow taken care of through the sixth or eighth grade . But at the high-school level the shortage is acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply unavailable for overseas work ? those that are precisely in the age bracket ( forty to fifty-five ) required for most positions of leadership . American business and government agencies report a continual tussle to keep good people in their employ overseas when their children reach high-school age ; and there is plenty of testimony from junior overseasmen who say they will stop serving abroad when their children become teen-agers . Not that there are no good secondary schools . In Europe there are English , Swiss , German , French , and even American schools which prepare their students adequately for U. S. prep school or college . But in the wide expanse from Southeast Asia to West Africa , most of the traditional " foreign " schools are designed to serve British and European needs . They may be just as good as schools in Denver or Atlanta or Lincoln , Nebraska ; often they make the children work harder than our public schools do . But they are " different , " and no parent wants to risk having his child superbly educated yet unable to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , parents worry lest their children may be " missing something . " One father told me , after returning home , that his girls had adjusted well following a stint abroad , but his son had a harder time . The boy was ahead of his friends in languages and literature , but he did n't know how to play baseball and he had n't been following the comic-strip adventures of Dick Tracy . Once back in America his young peers thought him " strange . " Parents prefer American-type schools not only  | on academic grounds but because they are determined to keep the children busy . Adolescents abroad , as in the U. S. , have a taste for gauging up and raising hell . In Teheran , for example , some American teen-agers drank , and rode their motorcycles with willful recklessness around the streets of the Persian capital . Other pranksters tried to scale the wall of the Soviet Embassy compound until they were discouraged by the guards ' bullets . Such youthful exuberance is harmless when the objective is the clapper of Nassau Hall 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign land . American secondary-school education seems to be rooted in the doctrine that American children have a great deal of surplus energy which must somehow be channeled into furious extracurricular activity ? a science club , the " Y , " a baseball league , or the cheering section at football games . Z17ratever she may have thought about these activities in the U. S. , an American mother overseas with a kinetic teen-ager is likely to pine for organized clubs and games . KEEPING THE SOCIAL POT BOILING I F 0 U R American women overseas are preoccupied with preserving American values in the food they eat , the doctors they consult , and the schools their children attend , it is not surprising that they should spend most of their " leisure time " in company with other Americans . It is , indeed , hard to avoid doing so . We got into overseas service because we thought it would be restful , " one wife told us with a twinkle . No doubt a few families naively assume that it would be soothing to get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But abroad or at home , it is evidently shameful for an American woman not to be busy , busy , busy . If she goes overseas , she will be caught up in a highly-organized American social whirl . Mirroring the shift in the international bal ante of power , British tea and the French ( JPritit have been elbowed aside by the American cocktail party as the occasion for diplomatic smiles and calculated " mixing . " ( The rise of Soviet power is likewise reflected in the growing popularity of the vodka binge . ) Some couples in Tokyo are invited to an average of twenty cocktail parties a week , and even at a small post one or two a day is not unusual . But the cocktail circuit serves a function beyond diplomacy : for the American administrators , it is part of an elaborate and often quite conscious plan to weld the - Americans at each post into a closely knit unit . Among the government missions at least , responsible officials are generally anxious to create a desperately full schedule of social functions among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and endless mutual invitations to dinner . The idea is to enhance the morale of the men at the office by making sure of an adequate ration of " belonging " for their wives . The military services , of course , have attained the highest development in exclusive togetherness . " As a Navy wife , " one girl told us with pride , " you 're never abroad . You 're always just in the Navy . The morale value of the social whirl inside the American community is offset , at some Asian and African posts , by its distressing effects on U. S. public relations among the surrounding " aliens . " Confidence in the American Way of Life causes many Americans to live on cultural islands of their own . A gruesome case in point is the memorable comment by a young wife in Washington Heights , an Army suburb in Tokyo which tries to look just like an American suburb , complete with super-market , movie theater , bow ling alley , and a restaurant featuring Texas beefsteak . One of the residents was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever ventured into the surrounding Oriental metropolis . " I went down to the Ginza once , " she replied . " but it was too crowded with Japanese . " Crossing the cultural line is not easy ; it demands unremitting effort against heavy odds . An American woman assumes that the way to get to know people is to exchange visits , to entertain in the home . But if she invites a business associate of her husband , he will seldom bring his wife unless she speaks English , or the American wife is fluent in her language . ( It is often much more important for the wife of an " operating diplomat " to learn the local language than it is for the husband to do so. )  | in some societies , such as Indonesia and Ethiopia , it is bad manners to decline an American invitation ? but it is not at all impolite to be a " No Show " when dinner time rolls around . The Americans are invited back infrequently . The nationals of most countries can not afford to entertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homes in comparison to the grand scale on which American officials and businessmen often live ; they often think ( mistakenly ) that the Americans will eat only American food , and they are naturally not geared to serve Western-style meals . Moreover , as an Embassy wife said of her own vigorous efforts to get to know some Ethiopians in Addis Ababa , " They know we are doing this because we are supposed to ? so there is n't a sense of obligation to invite you back . " The wives ' experience in trying to " get along with the nationals " naturally varies according to the country and the nature of the husband 's job . A missionary wife usually has close contact at least with students or religious associates , while business people are the most isolated . In Europe friendships are somewhat more readily made across the cultural barrier , in Latin America a knowledge of the local language is relatively more essential , in Asia considerations of caste and hierarchy are more troublesome . Anywhere , it takes hard work to establish real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal easier to have some congenial American girls over for bridge and a drink in the afternoon ? and avoid the strain and humiliation of groping in the darkroom of cross-cultural communication . THAT VIP FEELING B U T in spite of such frustrations , American families are staying abroad in droves . The excitement of travel and the prospect of making a little more money may get them overseas . But what keeps them there is something more : a sense of importance . Overseas , a woman finds more opportunities to flex whatever qualities of leadership she may have . A girl who would be a rookie in her home-town woman 's club becomes a charter member of a new activity abroad . In Taipei , for instance , American women established an International Club which now has two hundred members , half Chinese and half foreign . As the leaders and organizers , the Americans have more fun and scope than if they had joined a going organization at home . " My husband deals with the cabinet ministers here , " one lady told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLEVELAND 35 if we were home , the Secretary of State would n't give him the time of day . " American power rubs off on the individuals who represent it overseas . This happens not merely to the men in their offices , on their construction jobs , at their air bases , hospitals , trading posts , and mission homes . The American woman , too , meets princes , generals , or prime ministers ? just as a woman who lives in Washington , D. C. , is more likely than one in Salem , Oregon , to get invited to a reception for King Saud or the President of Brazil , or peer at Queen Elizabeth from the sidewalk . Asked why she liked Taipei , one American wife did not hesitate for a moment . " I get to meet so many important people here ? both Chinese and Americans ? that I would never meet at home . " And indeed , there are so many distinguished circuit riders these days that you are much more likely to meet a Senator , the Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Louis Armstrong or Bob Hope ? in Tunis or Tokyo than in New York . However , it is not merely because she can rub elbows with the mighty that the American wife abroad feels important . She is aware that what  | she does matters , how she acts is noticed . " Think what it would be like if you were the first Negro in a white community , " said the wife of a Foreign Service officer . " That 's what it 's like to represent your country abroad . " It 's a powerful motive , this sense of personal responsibility for the foreign relations of the United States . It can help a girl get used to fly-covered butter , eccentric plumbing , and eating with her fingers at a formal dinner . It can make her a boon to her husband and a major asset to American overseas operations . And its lack can blot the reputation of the world 's most powerful nation . NINE TIPS FOR TRAVELING LADIES I N THE course of our study we asked fifty American wives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass along to the thousands more who decide each year to try a stint or a lifetime of overseas service . Their composite advice would be something like this : ( 1 ) Decide you really want to go , and to stay for a long enough time to be effective . Otherwise stay home . ( 2 ) Learn all you can about the country you are going to . Do n't fret about memorizing superficial " manners " or " customs " ? you do n't want to deprive your new friends of the pleasure and " face " they get by telling you things you do n't know . Concentrate , instead , on history and heritage . Try to arrive at your post with some sense of where your hosts ' ideas come from , what they value most , what their heroes are like . ( 3 ) While you 're at it , brush up on your American history , and on the biggest issues of current American policy ? bomb-testing , say , and Little Rock . But when you get there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 4 ) Expect all the physical conditions to be worse than the old hands say ; they have forgotten what it was like to adjust as a newcomer . In most parts of the world , you can reduce your initial " culture shock " by taking along some soap , some water softener , some soft toilet paper , and a couple of DDT bombs . ( 5 ) Turn your curiosity button up to full volume . Determine to learn some of the language even if the old hands say you do n't really need it to get around , and even if you know you wo n't have the time to become proficient . Make the effort ? and it will be an effort ? to meet a wide cross section of your " hosts , " not just in drawing rooms and hotel lobbies but in markets and outside the capital cities . That way you 'll enjoy your visit more ? and so , hopefully , will the people who get to know you . ( 6 ) If you have children , school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the facilities ? but judge them by quality , not nationality . ( 7 ) Your children 's sojourn abroad is a rich opportunity for them to learn early the value of difference , which is the basis for democratic tolerance . Do n't try too hard to shield them from the experience . ( 8 ) As an example of free American womanhood , you 're a somewhat revolutionary force in most foreign societies . Do n't worry too much about the culture-patterns you are undermining just by being yourself ; they may be pretty decrepit anyway . ( 9 ) Do n't go all self-conscious about being a good-will ambassador . There 's nothing so offensive as a self-important female ? at home or abroad . @# Harper 's Magazine , March 1959
