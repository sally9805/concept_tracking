The world 's No. i admirer of the music of English Composer Frederick Delius ( 1862-1934 ) is crusty Sir Thomas Beecham , founder of a society in Delius ' honor , conductor of most of the available recordings of the composer . He once ( in 1934 ) called the career of Delius " the greatest and most far-reaching incident in music during the last 50 years , " and he meant every word of it . <P> Still crusading last week , Sir Thomas took his famed Royal Philharmonic Orchestra to Oxford 's New Theater for the world premiere of Delius ' 61-year-old opera , Irmelin . For four hours , the wistful music wended its peaceful way . The Princess Irmelin rejected her 100th suitor , explaining , in effect , that she was not frigid , just waiting for her dream man . She finally got him in the last scene , in the person of a swineherd . <P> <P> The London Times called it " an exquisite opera , " but the review otherwise showed no deep enthusiasm for the work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds that give delight and do not hurt or exacerbate in the least ... A very moving act of homage . " The Daily Express said bluntly that " the piece is not stageworthy . The plot is too insipid . The music ... is too syrup-sweet . " <P> Sir Thomas roared with indignation . " What do you want in opera ? " he demanded . " Imagination , feeling , poetry , romance . You do n't want thinking . Musicians do n't think . Delius is a world of fantasy , the miracle of English music . Yet these people who have the ears of Midas have n't the sense to vaunt him . " <P> As for English music critics , added Sir Thomas , they can be divided into three groups : " The first consists of three or four people who write about music in a scholarly , accurate , knowledgeable manner . After them conies a handful which write brightly and amusingly about music . They know little about it , are clever in avoiding the use of technical terms-and might just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much larger . Its members are quite hopeless-drooling , driveling , doleful , depressing dropsical drips . All English critics , without exception , are timid and conventional . " <P> <P> But he still saw hope for his composer : " I must have produced 100 operas which the press has described as negligible ; they all entered the repertoire . It took the press nearly 150 years to appreciate Mozart 's operas . Delius has only been dead 20 . There is a chance-by the end of the century . "
