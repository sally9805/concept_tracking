" They laughed when I sat down at my test tubes . " That is how the - University of California 's Nobel-prizewinning Virologist Wendell M. Stanley might have begun his San Francisco lecture . For many physicians thought that Stanley had gone much too far when he suggested that viruses , or virus-like particles , might be responsible for all forms of cancer . But in support of his hypothesis , Stanley last week marshaled a phalanx of evidence from more than a dozen high-powered researchers as well as from his own laboratories . <P> Said Stanley : " Since there is no evidence that human cancer is infectious , and because viruses are infectious agents , many investigators believe that they can not be important in the causation of human cancer . " Not necessarily true , argued Stanley . <P> Viruses are known to cause many animal tumors , have been shown to be bafflingly versatile-both infectious and noninfectious in turn , depending upon a variety of complex technical factors . Stanley noted many oddities about viruses : man has coursing through his body many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can mutate to new strains that cause different disease symptoms . <P> A real puzzler : viruses are closely related to the genes that determine inherited characteristics-so closely that they have been dubbed " naked genes . " This may help explain what some researchers regard as inherited tendencies to cancer . Concluded Stanley : " The time has come when we should change our thinking about cancer-virus relationships . " <P> Whatever the mechanics of cancer causation , early detection is essential . A case in point : lung cancer , which will not show up in chest X ray during its earlier stages . When it does show , it is often too late . The trick has been to get cells from lung secretions to make " Papanicoulaou smears " like those made famous in detecting cancer of the cervix and uterus . <P> In San Francisco last week Gustav J. Beck of Manhattan 's Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center manned a demonstration booth to show general practitioners how easily they can now do just this in their own offices-with gadgets that look like babies ' croup kettles .

The salt solution draws out fluid from bronchial cells and from the myriad tiny air-exchange cells ( alveoli ) in his lungs . The wetting agent helps bring out more fluid that contains cells . The patient coughs this up . When the substance is put under the microscope , an expert cancer detective can spot abnormal cells that indicate the beginnings of cancer and the need for treatment .
