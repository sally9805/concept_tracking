For the young recruits maneuvering about Fairmount Park in Philadelphia one day during World War I , the drill seemed strictly routine . But suddenly their first lieutenant began giving some very non-routine orders . Before they knew what was up , he had marched them across the green and straight into the art museum . There he proceeded to give them a learned lecture on the museum 's paintings . " I thought it would do them good , " the lieutenant explained latef . " And besides , they were my first captive audience . " <P> In time Theodore Sizer , professor at Yale of the history of art , was to lecture to thousands of audiences-but none ever considered itself captive . Sizer not only became a leading authority on American art , he also grew into something of a legend . Last week , at 65 , as he prepared to retire from teaching , he was already as much a part of Yale lore as John ( " Daily Themes " ) Berdan , William Lyon Phelps and the crotchety Johnsonian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan , Sizer graduated from Harvard in 1916 , went to Yale in 1927 after serving as curator of the Cleveland Museum of Art and lecturing at Western Reserve . An imposing man with a massive mustache , he soon made his mark in New Haven . His particular hero was the Revolutionary painter John Trumbull , and , like Colonel Trumbull , he seemed to come straight out of the 18th century . In those days , Sizer once said , " things were done in real style . " In his own way he tried to keep that style alive . Few sights were more impressive than that of Theodore Sizer marching majestically across the campus with his ancient blue-black cape billowing out behind him . <P> In class he lectured with such fervor that he once fell clean off his podium . " He transformed Yale 's art gallery from a static storehouse of paintings into a bustling teaching museum , established the school of architecture and design as a foremost trainer of museum directors . But the chief purpose behind his flamboyance was to " set my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of art or one period , tried to give his students both a taste for excellence and a taste for tolerance . " There are many ways of expressing the human spirit , " he would say , " and all possible ways are by no means exhausted . The new and strange always are a challenge , but let us at least feel a decent humility in the presence of unfamiliar forms of expression . " <P> " Sob Stuff . " In his spare time he hooks rugs ( " It 's therapeutic " ) , works on portraits of his 22 grandchildren , has designed banners for the university 's schools and colleges . He has an enthusiasm for heraldry and quill pen writing , once spent hours designing a silver box for a waitress who was retiring from one of the residential colleges . Last week , as news of his own retirement spread , he was absorbed in another sort of activity-reading the scores of letters from former students whom he had " set on fire . " " Mostly sob stuff ! " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not soon forget those letters , or their authors him .
