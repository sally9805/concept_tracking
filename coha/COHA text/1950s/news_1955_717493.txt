txt GEROSA ATTACKS BUDGET DRAFTERS Scores Plan Unit 's Counting on Amendment 5 Funds ? Hearings Open Today By CHARLES G. BENNETT The City Planning Commis- ' ' sion was criticized yesterday by , Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa for not preparing a 1956 capital ' budget " based on existing conditions . " In drafting its proposed $791 , -1 736,036 capital budget , the City Planning Commission assumed approval by the state 's voters on Nov. 8 of Amendment 5 . Amendment 5 would have permitted the placing of $82,464,000 outside the city 's present and future debt limit . This sum would have gone for the collection and treatment of sewage now polluting the city 's waters . The amendment was defeated . As a result , the Board of Estimate , which opens public hearings on the capital budget today at City Hall , must substantially revise the proposed allocations . The assumption is that some public improvements that would require funds within the debt limit must be deferred . Amendment 5 would have placed outside the debt limit $37,900,000 // of existing pollution control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , the proposed budget allots $44 , - 564,000 for pollution control in 1956 . In some City Hall circles there was surprise last night that Controller Gerosa had charged the City Planning Commission with the entire responsibility for preparing the 1956 capital budget on the assumption that Amendment 5 would pass . It had been understood that the planners had acted with the knowledge of strategically placed city officials who were represented as hoping that such action would help persuade sizable numbers of voters to support the amendment . Mayor 's Message Recalled Mayor Wagner , in a Sept. 15 statutory communication to the commission limiting " new " capital funds in 1956 to $175,000,000 , noted that additional funds within the debt limit would become available next Jan. 1 if the voters in November should approve the pollution control amendment . The additional funds , if made available , the Mayor asserted , should be assigned to transit and waterfront improvements . The accumulation of future debt , Controller Gerosa declared in his new report , can be controlled only by limiting " necessary " improvement expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the six-year period ending in 1961 . The commission 's projected $808,000,000 capital program for this interval , Mr. Gerosa complained , is $53,000,000 more than the Controller could safely recommend . By implication , Mr. Gerosa criticized the Planning Commission once more when he asserted that New York City was " in excellent financial condition at the present time " and predicted it would be the best-managed city in the world " once we curb our overzealous capital spending . " The city 's debt limit is 10 per cent of the average full valuation of real estate for 1955-56 and the four preceding years . The capital budget is a set of allocations of funds for public CRITICIZES COMMISSION : Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa , who attacked that body on the drafting of the capital budget for 1956. improvements to be financed by municipal borrowing . The city has $59,106,774 of borrowing powe .. - : within its debt limit after taking account of the proposed 1956 allocations for capital projects . Controller Gerosa cautioned that , without a curb now on capital expenditures , money needed for future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose value as legal investments in other cities . He put the city 's long-term debt as of last Oct. 1 at $3,606 , - 000,000 , with $1,576,000,000 of this exempt from the debt limit and $2,030,000,000 within it . He predicted that the capital program projected through 19611 would produce the ' ' staggering ' amount " of $2,000,000,000 in new municipal debt .. ' e " It must be borne in mind , " the Controller warned , " that the taxpayer has to pay the interest on and principal of all debt regardless of whether it is exempt from the city 's debt limit or not . " Wants His Reports Heeded The Controller held that the City Charter intended other city , agencies to heed his reports on the city 's financial condition and his advice as the maximum amount and nature of the debt that could safely be incurred . If they did not heed , he wrote , his advice and reports became merely a " futile gesture . " Mr. Gerosa recalled that , following a report he issued last Aug. 15 urging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " penny-pinching " and " penurious . " He declared , in reply , that he had not obstructed needed improvements . He also accused many of his critics of urging the defeat of Amendment 5 at the polls last week . A proposal of City Planning Commissioner Goodhue Livingston Jr . that the city turn its piers over to the Port of New York Authority was rejected by the Controller . The Port Authority , Mr. Gerosa said , would create a reserve or profit during the period of the proposed lease of $60,771,000 from pier rentals . The city 's revenues , he said , would diminish $72,691,000 through the loss of the pier rentals and related income .
