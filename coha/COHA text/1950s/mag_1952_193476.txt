The Grass Harp ( by Truman Capote ) gives forth , for a time , a tremulous , delicate music , catching in a special world of its own some of the deep longings of the real world . But the music falters : in dramatizing his novel , Capote has told a stagier story , and brought in more themes than he can orchestrate or develop . <P> Verena Talbo has always tyrannized her sister Dolly ( finely played by Mildred Natwick ) . But when she tries to cheat her as well , Dolly flees-with a young boy cousin and a tart-tongued servant ( well played by Georgia Burke ) - to a tree house in a wood . It is not only a revolt against ugly materialism , but an escape from reality . The trio are joined in their tree by a judge ; and the quartet sits about , lonely and lost , wishing and dreaming aloud . After some dime-novel hocus-pocus breaks in on their dream world , Dolly goes home to face reality , and her realistic sister Verena is humbled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal in the eccentric ; and his earlier scenes have a humorous shimmer and elan , as of a story that will move skippingly toward its secret . But the play thereafter can not evoke its meaning through its mood , or even sustain its mood . It becomes a half-farcical , half-melodramatic vaudeville , and its people finally go home less changed themselves than as though changes of character awaited them there . There is less a failure of logic than of magic , which is the more pronounced since the production-in Virgil Thomson 's atmospheric music and Cecil Beaton 's almost oppressively charming sets-so much stresses the fairy-tale note .
