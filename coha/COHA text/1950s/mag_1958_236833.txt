Topped by a high-style Emme hat , clenching a long cigarette holder suavely in its mouth , it purred a typically catty message : " I found out about Joan . That palace of theirs has wall-to-wall mortgages . And that car ? Darling , that 's horsepower , not earning power . They won it in a 50 raffle . " The most important fact about Joan was how she managed to dress well " on his income . " She shopped for her clothes at Manhattan 's Ohrbach 's , a low-budget department store with branches in Los Angeles and Newark , which has been trying to build up a high-fashion reputation with striking prestige ads ( TIME , Sept. 6 , 1954 ) . <P> Produced by the Manhattan ad agency of Doyle Dane Bernbach , Inc. and written by a 35-year-old bachelor girl named Judith Protas , the ad immediately drew hundreds of requests for copies . The greatest compliment came from Madison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohrbach 's ad on their own bulletin boards .
