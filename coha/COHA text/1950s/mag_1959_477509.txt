Birmingham-Southern College had its frail beginnings in 1856 as Southern University in the plantation country of Alabama . Its history was one long financial agony until it merged with Birmingham College in 1918 . With the support of Birmingham businessmen , the institution prospered until today it has become one of the leading small colleges in the South . The shift from the embrace of plantation owners to that of steel manufacturers , its gradual transition from a school offering " sanctified education " to a modern " church-related " college ? the euphemism is revealing ? defines not only Birmingham-Southern 's history but that of the South . The original Methodist founders , fired zealotry , saw their youth ringed around perils ? " the hotbeds of Calvinism . . . the darkness of Catholic convents . . . the chilling winds of abolitionism . . . the skepticism of state institutions . " " Is it because , " a spokesman asked , " we have no Institutions worthy of our patronage ? Then let us build them . " They did build them in great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and colleges went up throughout the young country , most of them far from the temptations of the city . Those early champions of Methodist probity would be startled at Birmingham-Southern today , where the Newman Society meets with impunity , Baptist and Presbyterian groups enjoy parity with Methodists , and a local rabbi turns up during Religious Emphasis Week . They would look askance at weekly chapels without prayer ( down-graded to mere convocations ) , at beauty contests which churn up more excitement than theology , at heated talk about the Beat Generation in the " Cellar , " the local Bohemianretreat . They might recognize the steel magnates as their legitimate successors , but they would still view quizzically the inaugural conference on the " mutuality of business and education . " Nevertheless , BSC is still unmistakably a denominational school .. - and a Southern one . The Ministerial Association co-exists amiably with the Physical Education Club . The President , a Methodist layman , teaches Sunday school ? although attired occasionally in silk suit and two-toned shoes . The girls are exemplars of Southern gentility . Above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students and faculty of a Southern tradition , even if its content is gradually thinning out under the onslaught of modernism . The college catalogue refers lugubriously to the " dark days of the ' sixties , " as if it were only yesterday . Southern oratory is fostered by scholarships awarder ! ! to high-school boys with a talent for the polished utterance . The most popular of the adult education courses deals with the campaigns of the War Between the States . In the library musty portraits of Southern generals look down on as chic a collection of highbrow quarterlies as can be found anywhere . A boy announced to me magisterially that his birthplace was the " Tigris-Euphrates of the South . " He said it with a twinkle which hardly belied his proud sense of place . BSC is located three miles from the business center of Birmingham on 250 acres of high wooded ground . The area is beginning to look seedy . Birmingham , like most cities , has brisk , new suburban developments ; to live outside of the industrial vallev ?

At night , from the top of campus hill , students can see tongues of flame from the blast furnaces in the valley below . Many people insist that Birmingham is not really a Southern city ? there are far too many steel workers from the North , and anyway the true South is cotton-rut-al . That is largely a sentimental pose . Those who showed me around the city apologized for the statue of Vulcan , an ungainly brute fifty-five feet high ? the only statue in the country to celebrate industry . But they took a furtive pride in its sheer muscular grotesquerie and were quick to point out that it is second in size only to the Statue of Liberty standard American ( which , they insist , they have been speaking all along ) . BSC is regarded as a ' ' study school " in contrast with the University of Alabama , which is sometimes described as the " country club of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student who said , " I would n't say that I 'm an intellectual , but I like the serious atmosphere . " A pretty girl said plaintively : " I was a straight A student in high school back home in Demopolis . I came here and gut all B 's and C 's . I was all tore up . " A fraternity boy remarked : " Study is a norm here . Everybody studies , so it 's not hard to do . " The college is on a three-quarter system ( three courses a semester , five hours a week for each ) . This seems to work well for science and mathematics , not so well for the humanities in which time is needed for intellectual gestation . Premedical and pre-dental courses are reputed to be the best in the state . For selected students there is available a science major of the most formidable proportions . At the same time , the college has to fight off pressures toward vocationalism . It divested itself of a weak journalism major , but it still offers secretarial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in business administration ( including accounting ) than there are in religion . Education courses flourish , particularly for women who are likely to capitulate to their mothers ' admonition to provide " insurance for the future . " Attached to the college is a conservatory of music , and its major role in the life of the institution probably derives from the Southern tradition of the well-brought-up lady . Challenging also is the fact that BSC offers ballet classes but no modern dance . ( Grahamesque contractions and percussive movements are here regarded as neither pretty nor ladylike . ) The college offers an art major and a talented artist-in-residence . Raymond J. MacMahon is a militant abstractionist ( " Art is man 's invention aimed at changing and improving nature " ) . " There is no aggressive opposition to modern art , " he observed . The trustees , largely other-directed types , dutifully take modern art courses in the evening . Of course , there are the inevitable thremxlies about student listlessness . " Your Brooklyn College students would devour us , " a faculty member said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students are markedly restrained and non-competitive . He recalls how in his student days in the South if a student left an examination room early , his departure was greeted by the stamping of feet ; the folkways had been flouted . Recently , this professor criticized William Graham Sumner 's thesis about the ascendency of mores over law . His students , living in one of the chief bastions of segregation , carefully took notes , unmindful of the controversial implications of what they were writing . 1 attended an English class concerned with Coleridge 's Biographia Literaria . The professor , an able scholar , talked about " the sacramental unity of the world apprehended through the imagination . " The students exhibited a kind of uneasy reverence for this imposing formulation as , heads bent , they piously took their ration of notes . At one point , the instructor asked , " Does anybody know what happens to poets in Plato 's Republic ? " No one responded . At the end of the session , crammed with the big issues of literary criticism , he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A psychology professor , active in counseling , sees BSC students as intellectually capable but academically stunted because of the poor quality of high-school education in the state , particularly in rural areas . ( It is possible to negotiate both high school and college in Alabama without any contact with mathematics . ) The Cellar , however , is pointed to as luminously intellectual . " It 's our own existentialist bistro , " the President said affectionately . The Cellar is a coffee shop in which the walls are lined with paperbacks , the tables cluttered with coffee cups , and the air is thick with talk ? bold , fearless , cosmopolitan talk which vaults the narrow barriers of Jones Valley . The academic community is divided in its view of the cave-dwellers . There is the usual scorn for the sedulous nonconformity of beards , uncombed hair , and shaved heads . A faculty member said sourly : " There 's a group here which thinks that if you sit in the Cellar and read the Manchester Guardian , you 're an intellectual . " However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't dare go near the Cellar . You 've got to he brilliant for them . " It would appear that the South does not provide a congenial atmosphere for rebellion . There is no student iconoclast , for example , like Richard Wheeler at the University of Wisconsin . The Hilltop News ' columnist is likely to urge students to be more polite at convocation . BSC itself has an intimate , familial flavor which dulls the edge of insurgency . There is a pervasive affection , a binding network of relationships that ensnares everybody . The President 's wife , for example , takes courses at the college . At a convocation I attended , Dr. Stanford announced genially : " There 's someone special in the front row - .. my sweet mother-in-law . " The students laughed appreciatively . At the end of the convocation , which featured a piano recital , a dean said of the girls who performed : " They sounded nice , and they looked real pretty . " ( This sense of the . ubiquitous family may have a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the values of their community on the race issue . ) ANGELS IN DISGUISE W H E N Southern University was planned , the argument advanced in its behalf was that young people sent to college far from home were likely to " imbibe vicious principles . " The founders ' search for a local habitation with the appropriate trappings of virtue ? and without " gambling , loafing , or drinking " ? was more successful than they knew . Sinful stirrings are still effectively contained . A faculty member , attend . ing a fraternity party , was dismayed to discover that there were no drinks and that the students were earnestly talking about grades . ' ' When I was at college , " he said with some indignation , " it was considered good form for fraternity men to fail their courses . " Certainly in contrast with the aggressive hedonism of the University of Wisconsin , BSC has a thin-lipped gentility . The pleasures of the flesh have only a furtive existence . There is no drinking at all in fraternity houses ? there is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only about one-quarter of the girls smoke . " I do n't object to girls ' smoking on moral grounds , " a boy said . " I just think it 's unfeminine . " In the uncharted wilderness of sex , the students of BSC are particularly circumspect . " I attended fraternity conventions and talked to boys from other schools , " a young man recalled . " The kind of thing they do is just unheard of here . " Men and women alike have a sense of being under stern surveillance . " If a girl has a reputation for being loose and you 're seen with her , " another fraternity man said , " word gets around . It 's like a small Southern town . " The girls openly proclaim their virtue . " I think we stand up for our morals more , " a girl said primly . " You know , Northern boys are fascinated by that . " And she told of a Harvard boy 's bewilderment at her exigent moral code . " If it were known that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member said , " she could hardly exist on campus . It 's almost unthinkable . " For many girls , college is a reversal of the usual pattern . It brings not a broadening of personal freedom , or an access of sophistication , but rather the restraints imposed by a community of moral peers . High school , with its conglomerate population , was likely to be a good deal more unbuttoned . " The boys are very polite , " a co-ed remarked . " It takes them about five dates to warm up . In high school I had to act like a prude but not here . Either they can tell by looking at you , or they just do n't have it on their mind . " I visited two sororities , where I saw two faces of the South . The Pi Beta Phis , many of whom are ministers ' daughters , call themselves " the Bible-carrying Pi Phis , " and boast of having the highest scholastic index . One of their songs explains that when a Pi Phi goes walking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him hold her hand , because a Pi Phi is an angel in disguise . " From the time I came here , " a Pi Phi in a simple cotton dress explained , " I never smelled liquor on anyone 's breath . I 'm a Methodist from head to toe . " Nevertheless sonic Pi Phis protested , " We 're human too , " and one girl described a foray into the back country in quest of a drinking place : " There 's this little nothing of a place clown nowhere . The atmosphere is so different from the college . You turn off on a gravel road , then you swing into a little mud road , and then you go deep into the woods . The place is just a shack . The paint 's peeling off the wall , the bulb flickers , and it 's cold near the windows . " She paused , then added with a delicious shiver : " But the band 's real good . " Alpha Omicron Pi , on the other hand , represents a bold slash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frocks , some of the girls wore tight toreador pants . There were Picasso prints on the wall and primitive statuary on the shelves . " The Pi Phis are sweet , " an AOPi officer said , " but we 're more aggressive , more liberal . We pride ourselves on our in-dividuality . " Tolerant about drinking , they ex ? pert boys to be moderate about it and to maintain their social standards at all times . A fraternity boy , a product of the Age of Eisenhower , expressed his preference for " the more liberal of the Pi Phis and the more conservative of the AOPis . " His brothers nodded their heads in agreement . Both sororities have in common an exuberant hospitality . " We 're so glad you dropped in , " they trilled . After the third or fourth time , it was clear that this was merely a conventional utterance . The Southern college girl is soft , respectful , and artfully feminine , in ironic con , trast to the remorseless Momism of the South . THE DUNGAREE CROWD 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deep bow to feminine beauty . Every issue of the school newspaper has some cautious but worshipful cheesecake . Every fraternity has a sweetheart elected with great fanfare . The grand climax of the school year is the selection of Miss Southern Accent . ( " The fifteen finalists will appear in white evening gowns accented by delicate orchid nosegays . " ) This year it was Margie Mills , a lovely , solemn-faced girl , determinedly unglamorous , with none of the postures of the aspiring starlet . How did she feel about winning ? " It made my mother real proud . " One of last year 's beauties garnered additional laurels as Miss Alabama and as runner-up in the Atlantic City Beauty Contest . ( Miss Alabama , through some clever footwork , seems to have become a special province of BSC . ) Willie-Lee Thornberry ( she has since dropped the Willie as immitigably provincial ) went on to New York and a career , hopefully , in show business . The 50 BIRMINGHAM ? SOUTHERN school newspaper avidly reported her appearance on the Dave Garroway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " Steam Heat , " and " Small Hotel " ) and then exhibited her baseball pitching prowess which had " helped the AOPis in intramurals last year . " The thriving theater group , almost one hundred strong , has watched Miss Thornberry 's career with proprietary interest . The North to most of them means freedom ... the opportunity to experiment . exotic people . Like theater kids everywhere , the girls wear paint-smeared dungarees , the boys have an air of almost desperate aestheticism , and there is the usual clatter of hammers and saws . The group , eclectic and unafraid , has produced such plays as " Antigone " and " Playboy of the Western World " as well as lightweight . staples like " Harvey . " A Few years ago they presented " The World of Sholom Aleichem " with the help of people in the community , the Southern drawl temporarily crossed with a Yiddish accent . The chumminess of college and community extends to other areas as well . It was explained to me that Birmingham is actually like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is large , and the Negro community , with which there is no contact , and what is left is a small cultural elite . ( " Do you know J. D. Salinger ? " someone asked me , projecting his own experience of a small literary coterie onto the vast literary subcontinent of New York City . ) The Birmingham Civic Ballet Company , one of the best community groups in the country , would be helpless without BSC students . " We 're not hothouse flowers , " a college student in the company remarked . " We 're a contributing part of the city . We realize that there is a world outside of ballet . " For local businessmen , it was a jolt to discover that the ballet company , originally something of a joke , was getting more publicity than the steel mills . They learned their lesson : Today , half the audience at a ballet performance consists of men . HOW RELIGIOUS IS IT ? I N THE old days BSC was a " preachers ' college . " Daily chapel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one-eighth of the students are preparing for full-time Christian work . ( Many of the women will never make it ; they will marry ministers en route . ) Some students have weekend pastorates . Sons of ordained clergy get a moderate reduc'on in tuition fees . Nevertheless , BirminghamSouthern 's denominationalism has a modern , liberal complexion . " Here we look at various interpretations of the religious life , " a member of the Religion Department stated , " My approach is in the Kantian tradition . that the heart of religion is ethics . You might say that our goal is an ethically-oriented theism . " He would like to see the college ally itself to the more progressive elements of the Methodist Church . In any case , he asserted , the tone of BSC is far healthier than the " aggressive secularism " of the state schools . President Stanford , in acknowledging an obli ? gation to the Church , pointed out that spiritual values can be achieved in many ways . A graduate student told him that the strongest spiritual influence he encountered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment to a moral order in the universe . There is a greater interest in religion today than there was twenty years ago and on a much more sophisticated level . " When I was a student here , " a faculty member recalled , " a boy might be disturbed by the theory of evolution , Now most of our students have resolved that problem in high school . " Both students and faculty have a patronizing attitude toward Howard College , a large Baptist school just outside of town . One professor at BSC sees Howard as " mass-producers of ministers and teachers , " and its students as raw bumpkins " who have never been further than the barn . " Nor does the pious atmosphere at Howard inspire much respect . " They pray around a tree over there , " a student said maliciously , " and there arc signs all over the place saying , ' Have you prayed today ? ' " BSC 's liberalism expresses itself in providing a haven for the Newman Society as well as for non-Methodist Protestant groups . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is characteristic of the warm , familial flavor that Jewish students are reluctant to create issues about social exclusion . " I knew that some of the fraternities could n't pledge me , while others could , " a young man explained . " I decided that I would n't pledge at all in order not to embarrass anyone . " Alabama 's Birmingham-Southern College is torn between a stubborn regional loyalty and the lure of the sophisticated North . It offers a series of lectures by Distinguished Southern Professors ( one of whom is from New jersey ) , but the Rushton Lecturers have included such luminaries from the great world as Arnold Toynbee , Howard Mumford Jones , Karl Comp. ton , and Francis Henry Taylor . Among its visiting professors have been Ivy League notables like Harry Carman of Columbia , Henri Peyre of Yale , and Willard Thorp of Princeton . BSC gallantly- tly sends some of its political science majors for a semester to that only vaguely Southern city , Washington , D. C. , to catch a glimpse of government in action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic legend , and part thumbing of the nose at the rich , smug North . A fraternity boy talked with pride of seeing an original Ku Klux Klan uniform hanging in his grandfather 's closet ( " The current Ku Klux does n't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath " ) . President Stanford lovingly quotes his granduncle who used to say , " We did n't lose the war ; we wore ourselves out whipping the Yankees ! " Southern pique at the facile snobberies of the North was expressed by a boy who declared : " When my high-school graduating class came to New York , we discovered that Northerners expected us to be barefoot . So we took our shoes off and put our feet out the window of the bus . " But there is also a sense among BSC students that the mystique of the South verges on absurdity . There is always an element of sly burlesque when the Southerner is most Southern . A Confederate flag was flown by a fraternity on Lee 's birthday . A wag in a rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrow into the flag . A newspaper in town published an account of the desecration , and the local chapter of United Daughters of the Confederacy howled . The South , like New England , has a fondness for its home-bred eccentricities . Faculty members talked with amusement about former President Guy E. Snavely , now the Chancellor . His disapproval of smoking is so thunderous that professors have been known to stub out cigarettes in the palm of theii- hands when he turns up unexpectedly . BSC students and faculty are largely gradual . ists , with a sprinkling of integrationists , and some old-fashioned fire-eating segregationists . But the issue , crucial as it is , seems to provoke more exasperation than troubled concern . " Northerners are much more interested in integration than we are , " a student remarked . " it 's the first thing they talk about when they come down here . " He was startled to learn that Rev. Martin Luther King of Montgomery , only one hundred miles away , has heroic dimensions in the North . The prevailing attitude is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a pre-ministerial student : " In a Christian idealistic way , I am for integration . But on the practical level , I am against it . The Negro is in a lower socio-economic group , and you ca n't mix with him . " A student leader said thoughtfully : " Intelligent Southerners have gotten over the idea that Negroes are descendants of Ham . Old ideas of racial superiority are going . However , Southerners feel that people in the North have this superior moral attitude . They do n't really understand the situation here . " Another student shifted the moral burden by saving , The Yankee traders brought the slaves in , and you ca n't legislate social differences out . " A candid boy said . " Integration does n't bother me , but I do n't want them to stop doing for us . " A lone voice crying out in the wasteland of prudence is that of Tommy Reeves , a BSC student and part-time minister , who was banished by threats of violence from his rural pastorate because of his views on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscure the need to do something now . In Birmingham schools it 's prohibited to discuss race problems . It 's a terrible thing when you ca n't educate people to love . " The college itself likes the idea of a strong moral commitment on the part of its students , but it is also cautious . It wants to become a first-class institution , and , as an administrator remarked , " You ca n't get too far ahead of your constituency . " Birmingham is a center of rabid , strong-arm racism , and most people of good will there have been cowed . There was real eloquence in the gesture of one of the faculty who , soon after I arrived in Birmingham , drove me through a handsome Negro suburban development , fun of beautifully-maintained ranch-houses . ( The income of Negroes in Birmingham is among the highest of their race in the South ; more than half the Negro families own their own homes . ) But this display of Negro opulence only heightened the pathos of the voicelessness which separates middle-class white and middle-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birmingham-Southern is pleasant , amiably argumentative , and intellectually alert . - There are few goofers here , " a recent addition observed . " I go into the lunchroom , and there 's always a lively exchange among people from various disciplines . " Salaries are modest but no lower than in many schools of its size . With the help of foundations , the average for full professor is $6,836 ( with a top salary of $8,200 after twenty-two years ) ; for associate professor , $5,546 ; for assistant professor , $4,650 ; for instructor , $3,800 . ( There are relatively few instructors because of the inflationary spiral in personnel recruitment . ) Any appraisal of salary has to take into account the housing arrangement on Greensboro Road , where , with loans secured by the college , a member of the faculty can build well and inexpensively . Recruitment of good people in these days of educational panic is increasingly difficult . In scarcity fields , like the sciences , relatively young men are brought in as associate professors . This generates resentment in less pinched departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And every year , there is the tense drama of how many people will be snatched away by marauding colleges dangling tank and money in seductive fashion . In the last few years , a history man became dean of Washington and Lee , while another became chairman of the his-story department at the University of Georgia . This year a psychology professor was lured North to the University of Cincinnati . BSC has a teaching faculty rather than a research one , The normal teaching load is fifteen hours , a heavy burden which relieves the faculty of any stern obligation to publish . This may very well be unwholesome . There is reason to believe that more members of the faculty would engage in scholarly activity if pressure were applied . But life for the faculty is probably pleasanter at BSC than at a large university with its cutthroat competition and steady pressures . There is even more scope for a leisurely and dilettante ( in the good sense ) life of the mind , since there is less urgency to burrow in one 's narrow little specialization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , fluid , unstratified school like BSC . A French professor reported that when there wasdemand for only two courses in his field , he introduced a course in Dante and one in Russian literature in translation . The intellectual quickening which this afforded is incalculable . " At the University of North Carolina , " he pointed out , " I would have to wait for the Dante man to die . " On the other hand , in many of the smaller departments ? philosophy and sociology , for example ? there is only one teacher with the inevitable loss of that vital cross-fertilization of ideas that comes from having someone else to talk to . Many windows arc kept open on the world of scholarship . With the help of foundation money , the staff gets around to conventions , meetings , and on private research junkets . ( The ivory tower has become highly mobile . College professors these days do a great deal of traveling . On a tight salary , life at home may be grubby , but on expense-paid trips , the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined to attend Southern regional meetings of scholarly organizations than national conventions , but the Mason and Dixon line is often breached . However , these jaunts into the world outside sometimes exacerbate feelings of inferiority vis a vis the North . Otherwise , life for the faculty is ingrown ? they teach next door to each other in Monger or Phillips Hall and then peer at each other over the split-rail fence on Greensboro Road . Dinner parties are the staple entertainment , and , as one faculty wife said , " The art of gossip is kept alive . " College politics are held in check by a Southern sense of decorum . Moreover , the school is so small , the President so accessible , that the paranoic we-they view of the administrative apparatus is hard to maintain . There are some minor skirmishes over smok. ing and drinking . In the old days faculty could smoke only beyond the college rail . Today , the drinkers and smokers outnumber the abstainers . But the fundamentalist ethos dies hard . I attended a dinner party given by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A professor who had promised to show me around a college dance asked me if I still wanted to go . " You see . " he explained , " if I have to go to the dance I ca n't drink . But if Fin not going , I can have a cocktail or two . " Faculty row is like a small suburban development ? the neatly-spaced homes getting more contemporary in design the further down ( the lower in rank and age ) you go ; the carports and the tow-headed children more numerous . Life on a tight budget is reasonably tranquil . " During the ' thirties , " a professor with a long memory recalled , " there was lots of worrying about Loyalist Spain . Today the faculty is interested in payments on the washing machine and changes in the pension plan . " Sometimes they are interested in each other . A recent arrival , a gifted teacher with a solemn respect for his own crochets , has provoked a good deal of talk , much of it good-natured . This man has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students . Tame stuff at Harvard , it is bold adventuring at BSC . His home , in particular , has generated furious gossip . A crisis developed when he presented plans for an ultramodern dwelling , charitably described as " a boxcar turned over . " The President had a tough decision to make : Should the college impose its tastes on the new faculty member ? In the end , the professor 's academic prowess won him immunity for his architectural venturesomeness . " The idea of going to Birmingham-Southern threw me at first , " a faculty member said . " Then people where I was teaching began to say nice things about it , and I decided to come . It 's an odd situation . We have a nice administration and good students , but we 're in Birmingham ? a cultural fortress surrounded by a wilderness . " Another professor feels stifled by the all-enveloping decorum . " You do n't get the occasional wild woman here you find on other campuses , " he observed . " I know they upset things , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses as if she does n't care what people think , or who dedicates herself passionately to English madrigals . " The race problem creates a brooding disquietude . Most of BSC 's faculty is Southern . The dangers of provincialism are apparent to all . But as long as vast areas of the South are subservient to the White Citizens Councils , it will be difficult to attract able academicians from dee North . A professor at the University of Wisconsin said angrily : " Why should I send graduate students to teach in the South and subject them to what 's going on there ? " DR . Henry King Stanford is that rare phenomenon ? a popular college president . Like Birmingham-Southern itself , he represents the mingling of the old and new . Courtly and graceful , he has a sympathetic appreciation of the Southern tradition , but he is shrewdly attuned to current realities . Moreover , he has had his fling beyond the sacred groves . He received his Ph.D . in political science from New York University , worked for a time with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkey with a government mission . And he is young ? slightly over forty . His description of the faculty ? " Southern but urbane " ? applies with particular force to him . He drives a gleaming new Cadillac ( " one of the advantages of having rich trustees " ) , dresses jauntily , and has a lively though civilized sense of life 's spoils . The day I arrived I was taken to dinner by Dr. Stanford at a private hilltop dining club called with panache The Club . ( It is inevitable that a peevish member of the faculty would complain about this . " Stanford tries to show his sophistication , " he said . " You know , he 'll say , ' Yes , you do use vodka in a screwdriver ' . " ) Skillful in his relations with the college 's benefactors , yet genuinely responsive to ideas , Stanford has won a secure place in his short tenure . In fact , there is some anxiety that he will be snapped up by a larger institution and then replaced by " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function of BSC as " a kind of academic conscience for the community . " Like college presidents everywhere , Stanford is driving hard toward excellence . Private colleges should be dedicated to quality , he argues . On the other hand , he does not envision Birmingham-Southern merely as a breeding ground for Phi Beta Kappas . " We want a good sprinkling of C students , " he said . " They 're the ones who go on to make the money with which to endow new colleges in the future . " BSC has an amicable rivalry with Agnes Scott , Davidson , University of the South , Southwestern at Memphis , and Randolph-Macon . But excellence in this league is not enough , Stanford asserts . " We should now lift our sights to national standards of excellence and exert every effort to achieve them , " he declared at his inauguration . A student speaker on the same occasion touched on another reality : " This hilltop rises above a valley shadowed by fears and ignorance .... The people of the earth look to such institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that until the College exercises that leadership in the current crisis in the South its chances of achieving the excellence it so earnestly desires will remain slender indeed .
