fist at this time . He was certainly active in the Workers Alliance , an organization of WPA workers and the jobless whose activities the Communists were trying to infiltrate and direct . On one occasion , when Remington and another organizer tried to persuade workers in a hosiery factory at Cookville , Tennessee , to join the Alliance , they were badly beaten up . Whether this experience drove Remington farther to the Left , no one can say with certainty . He always insisted that his activities for the Alliance had been inspired by an interest in the labor movement and that he had not known some of his associates were Communists . When Remington resumed his interrupted scholastic career , he was , to all appearances , the same flamboyant , voluble intellectual . Actually , he insisted , he came back from his year of hard knocks in the practical world " a lot less sure of the notions I 'd had when I left college . " He said he had " more respect for the opinions of the college administration and faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by exposure in the South . " Whatever the exact truth about his private convictions , there can be no question about his brilliance as a scholar . He was one of seven seniors who were allowed to scrap the curriculum and choose their own courses of study . He was one of two seniors on the student organization 's governing body . He was not only Phi Beta Kappa but top man in his graduating class . IT WAS during his junior year at Dartmouth that Remington met the femme fatale of his life . The date was February 26 , 1938 ; the occasion , an intercollegiate conference on foreign policy . Remington was a delegate from Dartmouth ; Ann Moos came from Bennington College in Vermont . Smitten by the slender , pretty brunette , Remington forgot foreign policy long enough to make a date with her . Ann was the daughter of Mrs. Elizabeth Moos , a teacher and school principal , who had a large home at Croton-on-Hudson in Westchester County just north of New York . Mrs. Moos was an avowed Communist  --  her home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her daughter was already an ideological spitfire . Remington recognized this , but he was in love . To further his suit , he told the court , he painted himself to Ann as being far more radical than he actually was . He recalled especially an auto ride to an American Students Union meeting at Harvard , during which he and a Dartmouth friend , Charles Livermore , a C.I.O. worker in New Hampshire , both made a pitch for the affections of the girl . " We both bragged that we were real radicals , not just pinkos , " Remington testified . " We were radicals who had engaged in labor organization . " " You exaggerated ? " his counsel asked . " Yes , " Remington said with a wry grin . " I made the fight at Cookville a pretty good story , full of gory details . We were both trying to win her attention . " " You were courting Miss Moos at the time ? " " Yes . Livermore left us in the car a bit later , and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Remington denied that he had ever told Ann he was a Communist Party member ; he repudiated completely her story that he had taken a solemn vow to remain a forever-faithful Communist before she consented to marry him . " We were talking about getting married , " he testified . " She was worried about my ambition . She wanted me to promise not to become a businessman . She was worried about the Republicanism of my family . I told her she need n't worry , that I would never be so concerned over my personal ambitions that I would forget about human welfare . " THE COUPLE were married in a civil ceremony in New York on November 28 , 1938 . They spent long idyllic weekends at the bride 's home in Croton , and the following June , they were wed again in a religious ceremony . Remington graduated from Dartmouth that same spring , and was undecided for a time whether to follow law or economics as a career . He decided upon the latter and studied for a year at Columbia University . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
