Room 115 of the Sheraton-Blackstone Hotel was air-conditioned , but the occupants were not : they were the 16 members of the Democratic Platform Committee 's drafting subcommittee . Early in the morning , after more than four hours of wrangling , softened and moderated by Massachusetts ' John W. McCormack , the Democrats ' civil-rights plank was nailed down . The subcommittee had handled the blazing Supreme Court issue in the spirit of unity , compromise , and remarkable consideration for each others ' regional problems . <P> " Recent decisions of the Supreme Court relating to segregation , " read the crucial paragraph , " have brought consequences of vast importance to our nation as a whole and especially to communities directly affected . We reject all proposals for the use of force to interfere with the orderly determination of these matters by the courts . . . The Supreme Court 's decisions are part of the law of the land . " <P> Outside Pressure . For Mississippi 's Governor James Plemon Coleman , who led the five-man Southern wing of the subcommittee over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palatable " ; i.e. , the plank was not shoved down his throat . His willingness to negotiate had kept the committee from blowing up altogether . But he and his fellow Southerners were sure of one thing : they would not countenance a change in the wording that would indicate any pledge to implement the Supreme Court 's decision . This settled , John McCormack called for a vote at 2:45 a.m . For the record , the solid South dutifully voted against the plank , knowing full well that it would carry 11-5 . It did . <P> No sooner had Chairman McCormack solved his problems within the room than he ran into a violent and unexpected pressure buildup outside . A band of Northern civil-rights warriors , dogmatically certain that any compromise was bad , caught John McCormack before he got to bed . At the head of the band were Michigan 's Governor G. Mennen ( " Soapy " ) Williams ( who comes up for re-election this year , must deal with powerful Negro and auto worker groups in Michigan ) , New York City 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , A.D.A . and other civil-rights groups . They demanded to know what the plank said . McCormack politely refused to tell them . <P> " Thank You , John . " Far into the morning the unhappy warriors , bossed by A.F.L.-C.I.O. ' s Walter Reuther , fanned out in a relentless search for a copy of the plank . At length they got it ; when the subcommittee presented its plank to the full platform committee , a civil-rights agent smuggled out a penciled version of the wording . Now Reuther &; Co. set earnestly to work . Nothing would suit the band except the insertion of a sentence in the plank reading , " We pledge to carry out these Supreme Court decisions , " and the addition of a paragraph from the 1952 platform calling for federal civil-rights legislation , all poison to the South . ( Reuther later was willing to concede that the McCormack plank was " something I could live with .
