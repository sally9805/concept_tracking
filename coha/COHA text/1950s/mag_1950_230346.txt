There is no particular prejudice against an 18-year-old girl who enters a national trapshooting contest . But she is not supposed to win . In the Grand American Trapshoot at Vandalia , Ohio last week , to the utter consternation of a 98% male field , one of them did just that . <P> Against the champions of the other 47 states ( and Cuba ) , Florida 's Joan Pflueger of North Miami handled her 12-gauge gun with the ease of an old infantryman . From a 16-yd. handicap mark , blonde , self-contained Joan " smoked " ( shattered to dust ) 100 straight clay pigeons . That gave her a tie with four others . In a 75-bird shoot-off , Joan tightened up a bit : she missed one . The others missed more . Joan won by one shot from sharpshooting Texas Champion Dean Blank . <P> Joan earned the right to compete in the champion-of-champions event when Florida Champion Clyde Wells was unable to make the trip . Joan was runner-up to Wells this year . Her coach , Fred Etchen , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1924 U.S. Olympic trapshoot team , was inclined to regard Joan 's Annie Oakley feat as a fluke . " It would n't happen again in a thousand years , " he said . In the 51 years of the Grand American Trapshoot , certainly , nothing like it had ever happened before .
