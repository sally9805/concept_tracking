Even before July 21 , 1921 , the day Billy Mitchell flew a cocky pennant from the tail of his biplane as he led a demonstration bombing of the German battleship Ostfriesland , the Air Service , then and for 26 years after , a limb of the Army , was determined to have its own traditions . Last week the design of the new Air Force Academy , unveiled in models at Colorado Springs , resolutely avoided any resemblance to pseudo-Gothic West Point or the traditional brick and stone buildings at Annapolis . Said one of the architects , Nathaniel Owings : " It was our job here to provide the framework for the traditions of future generations of airmen . " <P> The Air Academy will be fashioned of stainless steel , aluminum and glass around a 17,500-acre trapezoid at the foot of the Rockies . Explained Owings : " We believe that the architectural concepts of the academy buildings should represent . . . <P> the simple , direct , modern way of life-that they should be as modern , as timeless and as styleless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their basic layout , as the most modern projected aircraft . " Most of the buildings will have glass walls , all of them will be low ( never more than 70 ft. high ) , and most flat-topped . <P> A Great Glass Cube . A long chapel with a peak that looks as if it had been cut by a giant 's pinking shears will dominate the main campus . The Air Force release says that the chapel , like " the ancient Abbey of Mont St. Michel , " stands on high ground and dominates its surroundings . The resemblance ends there . Below the chapel there will be a broad terrace , named the Court of Honor . Off the terrace the long Administration Building will stand , and across from it a great glass cube , the Social Hall with a 3,000-seat theater and prom-sized rooms . It will be only a short moonlight walk away from the proposed Guest House . <P> Designs may change between now and 1957 when the first classes will move in ( between this summer and then , cadets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barracks are designed to hold six groups of four squadrons each . Each cadet will have built-in furniture ( except the bed ) and one roommate . Bedroom floors will be of terrazzo , inside walls of painted plaster . The dining hall will seat all 2,496 students . The academic buildings will have a closed-circuit TV system for special lectures . The walls of the classrooms will be movable , so that instruction groups can vary in size . Students will move from class to class on outside galleries , " thus providing a visual release from classroom work . " <P> A Cigarette Factory ? Plans call for an airfield with an 8,800-ft. runway and an Air Force village with four neighborhoods of single homes ( " all will look out upon continuous areas of common outdoor living space " ) , complete with a shopping center and a school system for the families of the airmen , officers and faculty who will staff the school . The Air Force has planned for a " natatorium , " squash courts , football , speedball and soccer fields . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parking space for football crowds will start in June . <P> Not all of those who viewed the model campus last week approved . Representative Porter Hardy Jr. , Virginia Democrat , grumped : " Someone said the academy looks like a modernistic cigarette factory .
