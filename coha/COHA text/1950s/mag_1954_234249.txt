Robert R. Young and the New York Central 's President William White both went courting last week . Objects of their affections : more than 40,000 small stockholders in the Central , whose votes on May 26 will decide control of the second largest ( in total revenues ) U.S. railroad system . <P> In a letter accompanying his proxy request Young said : " Central 's stock during the last 25 years has declined marketwise 33 percentage points more than the Moody averages . . . This sorry state of New York Central affairs ... is basically due to the fact that its present board together owned , according to last year 's proxy statement , only 13,750 shares of stock , or less than of 1% . " Said White , in his letter : " What is involved ... is the attempt of a promoter and pseudo railroad man , Robert R. Young , to seize control of the company . . . As a railroad executive . Mr. Young has been found to be lavish in his ideas and the expenditure of money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the promoter type of management and the experienced professional type . " <P> To Have &; to Vote . The proxy statements showed that the Central management has been loading up on the railroad 's stock . The Central 's directors now hold not 13,750 but 106,622 shares ( out of 6,447,410 outstanding ) , chiefly because Director Harold S. Vanderbilt has increased his holdings from 10,000 shares to 60,000 . The Young slate claimed ownership of 1,089,880 shares , or about 17% . But the big end of the Young group 's holdings is the 800,000 shares listed for Texas Oilmen Clint W. Murchison and Sid W. Richardson , which the Central still refuses to transfer to the Texans in its record books ( TIME , April 12 ) . <P> Since the Central set April 19 as the last day for such a transfer , the Texans have little time left , though they still hope to vote it through " legal strategy . " <P> So far , both sides have had little success with legal strategy . The Central had asked the Interstate Commerce Commission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Cyrus Eaton of control of the Chesapeake &; Ohio Railway , and the C. &; O. 's sale of its New York Central holdings to Murchison-Richardson ) . But the ICC last week turned down the request . The Central filed another petition asking whether Young 's slate could be lawfully seated if elected , but chances for a favorable ruling on that seemed slim , too . From another quarter , the Central gained an ally . An Alleghany Corp . stockholder , Mrs. Sadie Zenn , owner of 500 shares , filed a suit against the corporation , objecting to the fact that Alleghany had lent $7,500,000 to Murchison and Richardson to help them buy their stock . She wanted the deal canceled . <P> The Central also scored when it released its annual report . Earnings in 1953 were $34 million , highest in nine years . White said he hoped that higher dividends can be paid " when earnings will . . . permit . "
