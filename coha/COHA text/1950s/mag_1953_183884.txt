BATTLE OF INDOCHINA <P> After months of tortuous indecision , a French government was at action stations last week . The order : buoy up the nation 's economy . With each succeeding day ( including Sunday ) , the government sinks $6,000,000 deeper into the red . Millifranc notes are pouring from the government printing presses to float government payrolls , but soon the inflation must be plugged or the economy will be in danger of foundering . <P> With taxation at 33% of the gross national product ( compared with 20% in the U.S. ) , a compensating increase in revenue is out of the question . What cuts can be made ? The social-welfare budget is an obvious choice for surgery , but with the left-wing members dominating the Assembly , no government could survive an attack on this . Last year Premier Pinay made a success by slashing long-term investments , but the gain was temporary , the loss to industry permanent . <P> The Unpopular War . The department every French politician has in mind , but has not yet dared meddle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for about 37% of the budget . Of this amount nearly half , including a half-billion-dollar contribution from the U.S. , drains away in the war in Indo-China . If that unpopular war , now in its seventh year , could be brought to a close , France 's economic problem might be solved . More than that , the country would be in better shape to play its part in the European Defense Community : with more troops at home it would have less reason to fear a rearmed West Germany . So argues an increasing number of politicians , whose spokesman , Pierre Mends-France , came close to being Premier five weeks ago . Watching the U.N . negotiating with the Communists in Korea , they feel that there can be no dishonor in opening negotiations with the Viet Minh Communists . <P> France is not yet ready for Mends-France 's solutions . The expendable stand-in government of Premier Joseph Laniel was not talking truce last week , but it took the first move in setting up a situation from which advances might be made . It offered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nam , the states of Indo-China , to encourage them to take a larger share in their own defense . <P> Doing Less . Architect of the French plan is shrewd little Vice Premier Paul Reynaud , who visualizes a new French Union with wider , less binding provisions , after the style of the British Commonwealth , one which offers the small , weak states many advantages , but from which they may secede at will . " I do n't see how that could happen , " he adds , " because they would n't last 24 hours . " At week 's end , Viet Nam had accepted the French proposals , Laos was undecided , but Cambodia 's King Norodom was acting as cagily as Syngman Rhee . <P> In Paris , the French Cabinet studied the plans of General Henri Navarre for a fall offensive against the Viet Minh , and moved sharp-eyed Ambassador Maurice Dejean from Tokyo to be Commissioner General in Saigon . Said Dejean : " They the Associated States will get all the freedom they want , limited only by the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
