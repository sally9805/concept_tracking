txt Congressional investigators decided today to build up a case for a contempt-of-Congress action against Bernard Goldfine . The House Special Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight took this course instead of proceeding immediately to seek a. contempt citation against the New England industrialist . The ( panel acted after his refusal this afternoon to respond to the one question he had been ordered to answer . The subcommittee members agreed they had ample ground ' for citing Mr. Goldfine , friend of Sherman Adams , the Assistant to President Eisenhower . But they also agreed they should develop tomorrow the record for a " possible contempt citation . The subcommittee met in exlecutive session to map its course after another stormy public session , During that session Mr. Goldfine refused to tell about the financial affairs of his W.-tile and real estate companies .. Harris Orders Subpoena These " internal affairs , " he contended , were not relevant to the House group 's investigation of his troubles with Federal regulatory agencies and his relations with Mr. Adams . His position led the subcdntmittee chairman , Representative Oren Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issuance of a subpoena for the account books of Mr. Goldfine 's companies in an effort to solve the problem of $776,000 in bank checks , some uncashed fore years . For two hours this morning the subcommittee ' pursued its efforts to find out why and how the Goldfine checks had been used . And again it was unsuccessful in finding out whether any of this money had been used to influence the dispositions ' of complaints against Goldfine companies by the Federal Trade Commission . Mr. Goldfine denied the money had anything to do with agencies or public officials . The S. E. C. Troubles This ' afternoon , the committee peered into Mr. Goldfine 's troubles with the Securities and Exchange Commission . It was this part of the inquiry that led to the threat of contempt proceedings and a shouting match between Mr. Goldfine and Representative John E. Moss , Democrat of California . Mr. Goldfine shouted at Representative Moss that " it 's my business and not yours " that he had charged off as business expenses the hotel bills he had paid for three Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same laws as the rest of us , " retorted Mr. Moss . " That remains to be seen , " , Mr. Goldfine said as spectators gasped in the caucus room of the Old House Office Building : " That is a most interesting observation , " . Mr. Moss commented , " because it so patently states the attitude that you have evidenced since these hearings commenced . " Harris Asks for Order Their exchanges continued as Chairman Harris pounded for order . The furor sent Mr. Goldfine 's public relations adviser , Jack Lotto , former New York newspaper man , into action . Obviously , disturbed by the outburst , Mr. Lotto and Goldfine lawyers went into a huddle . Mr. Lott , pounded out a statement on a typewriter , and led Mr. Goldfine to a battery of microphones before television and newsreel cameras outside the hearing MOM . " I 'd like to correct myself , " Mr. Goldfine said in referring to his shouted words about " that remains to be seen . " " What I meant to say , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over I 'll then know whether I have been treated like everyone else which is all I want . I certainly did not mean to imply that I was above the law . No man is . " The three Republican Senators who were the ? recipients of Mr. Goldfine 's hospitality were Styles Bridges and Norris Cotton of New Hampshire , where Mr. Goldfine has textile mills , and Frederick G. Payne of Maine . Records introduced showed Mr. Goldfine had paid a total of $1,196.55 in hotel bills for the Senators . The subcommittee staff also , toted up the hotel bills paid by Mr. Goldfine for Mr. Adams in the five-year period ending last May 7 . They came to $3,096.56 , instead of the $2,000 figure cited earlier . And to the hotel bills -. gas added one for $63.89 at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York , paid by Mr. Goldfine for Federal Judge William T. McCarthy of Boston . Two other bills for the judge that the subcommittee counsel said had been charged to one of Mr. Goldfine 's companies were not put into the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldfane 's bookkeeper . Sought S. E. C. Information ? Judge McCarthy had disqualified himself in an S. E. C. case against two of Mr. Goldfine 's Boston real companies in 1955 . He had signed one order directing the companies to file annual financial and other reports before stepping out of further proceedings . It was about this case that Senators Cotton and Payne have acknowledged they sought information from the S. E. C. They met with the general counsel of the agency in the Capitol Building office of Senator Bridges , Senate Republican whip , to get it . It also is the case that Mr. Adams had asked Gerald D. Morgan , special counsel to the President , to inquire into . Mr. Adams testified that Mr. Morgan met with the S. E. C. 's general coimv ,  | in the White House . Mr. Adams and the Senators denied they had tried to influence the commission in any way but only sought information as a matter ' of routine . Senator Cotton is a stockholder in one of Mr. Goldfine 's New Hampshire textile mills and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , N. H. The amount of the bills paid for Governor Adams increased on the basis of subpoenaed records from Miss Paperman . The complete details of the bills were not spelled out for the record . All the bills were for hospitality at the Sheraton-Plaza in Boston , the Waldorf-Astoria in New York and the Mayflower in Plymouth , Mass . Bills Listed Since 1950 Miss Paperman testified that the list she gave to the subcommittee was all she had on hotel bills for public officials in the period since 1950 . This S. E. C. case also was the-focal point of the contempt proceedings threatened by the subcommittee . After the executive session late today , Chairman Harris was asked whether the subcommittee would take contempt action if Mr. Goldfine failed to purge himself tomorrow . " We 'll take that step when we come to it , " he replied . Other subcommittee members indicated they did not believe Mr. Goldfine would agree to answer . His Boston counsel , Samuel P. Sears , indicated Mr. Goldfine would fight all the way . Mr. Goldfine himself said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether he was ready to fight a. contempt citation . Mr. Harris told reporters the " committee feels it has ample " reasons to take contempt action . But , he said in a statement , the committee will decide the action it will take after the record is complete . Mr. Goldfine has declined to answer , he said , " what the committee believes a relevant and pertinent question bearing on this investigation , " and in line with the intent of the House in creating the special subcommittee . The panel 's assigned task is to find out whether the agencies are functioning as Congress intended . Faces Year in Prison Con.viction in court for contempt of Congress carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $1,000 fine . If a subcommittee votes to cite a witness for contempt the question goes to the parent committee for approval or rejection . In the present case the parent committee is the , House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee . Approval by the parent committee would send it to the House for concurrence or rejection . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? forwarded directly to the United States Attorney . It is rip to the Federal Attorney to decide whether to take the raatter before a grand jury : An indictment would be followed by normal court procedure in a Federal case. , Goldfine Statement Cited The question Mr. Goldfine refused to answer on grounds of irrelevancy stemmed from his prepared statement last week . In the statement , he said that he had " paid Ir:ry little attention " to the affairs of the real estate concerns , the East Boston Company and the Boston Port Development Company . Robert W. Lislunan , subcommittee counsel , asked him whether in view of this statement , he was . " sufficiently familiar with the cash position " of the Boston Port Development Company to withdraw 120,000 in cash on Dec. 22 , 1947 . Mr. Lishman said a like amount had been withdrawn for the late William J. , a director who managed the companies . Company auditors , Mr. . Lishman said , reported that " supporting vouchers for the alleged withdrawals were not available . " Mr. Goldfine conferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer on the ground that the matter was irrelevant and not pertinent to the inquiry . The subcommittee counsel insisted the question had the " utmost relevancy and pertinency " because the companies had " defied the S. E. C. for a period of eight years " and had provided time for minority stockholders to be " victimized . " Mr. Goldfine heatedly denied the accusation . ? " No stockholders have been victimized , " he asserted . " When he talks victimized I do n't know what he is talking about . " His counsel , Mr. Sears , interjected that the companies ' internal affairs were of " no concern to this committee . " This drew from Mr. Harris that it was " up to the committee to decide . " Mr. Sears retorted : " I beg your pardon , there are other tribunals . " Representative Harris ruled the question was relevant and suggested Mr. Goldfine answer . Once again Mr. Goldfine refused , adding that it , concerned matters presently in litigation in Federal Court in Boston . He referred to a suit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other alternative , " Mr. Harris told the 67-year-old , industrialist , " except to direct that you answer the question , and I order you now to answer the question as propounded by Mr. Lishman , the counsel of the committee . " He went on : " Your failure to do so , I might advise you , could very likely lead to proceedings of contempt . " Mr. Lishman then said , in answer to the chairman 's questions , that he could not proceed with questions he had intended to ask if he did not have an answer to that question . Mr. Harris was supported in his ruling by Representative John B. Bennett , Republican of Michigan , who yesterday challenged Mr. Harris . Mr. Bennett had asked the chair to direct Mr. Goldfine to answer certain questions but the chairman had overruled him . As the questioning turned to the Securities and Exchange Commission , Mr. Goldfine 's Washington counsel , Roger Robb , left his customary place at Mr. Goldfine 's right hand . Mr. Sears and Lawrence Cohen also of Boston , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his partner , William A. Porter , took no ? part , in ? the efforts to get Mr. Goldfine ? tol the microphone . ' Asked what Mr. Goldfine intended to do if he were cited for contempt , Mr. Robb replied : " The Boston team is handling that . I 've got no comment . " Mr. Sears was asked whether Mr. Robb 's actions had any significance . ? He said no , because the Washington lawyer was not mainly concerned with the S. E. C. investigation , which originated in Boston and had been handled there by himself and other Boston lawyers . 18 Checks Are Shown Miss Paperman brought to the hearing again today eighteen certified and treasurer 's checks issued by the Pilgrim Trust Company , which Mr. Goldfine said he still held uncashed . They totaled $214,671.41 . These " live " checks were handled gingerly by Mr. Lishman who made certain , after he detailed them , that the record show he had handed them back to Miss Paperman . The checks are part of the $776,000 in bank checks found by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the 1941-43 period , Miss Paperman has testified , can not be accounted for because the records have been destroyed . She also said she had no idea what happened to them . The " live " checks presented today ranged from $50 to $100 , - opo . The $100,000 check was payable to Mr. - Goldfine as was one of $50,000 . Both of these checks were dated April 4 of this year ? and were purchased by the Strathmore Woolen Company , the concern to which hotel bills and gifts wera. charged by Mr. Goldfine . All but a few of the checks were marked " not used . " Two of them bore endorsements . One for $6,500 had been endorsed by Mr. Goldfine although not cashed . Another for $33,630.91 was made payable and endorsed by Samuel Pearlman , who is a partner in the Yale Wool Waste Company of Boston , which has done business with Goldfine textile mills . Bridges Explains Of the total of $1,196.55 paid in hotel bills for the three Senators , the records show that $181.98 had beenfor the stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plymouth , Mass. , on Aug. 15-18 , 1957 , when Senators Cotton and Payne also were present with their wives . Senator Bridges said the visit with the Goldfines had been a " social " week-end . " There was no business , " he said . " It 's the only hotel bill he ever paid for me in my life . " Senator Payne , who said he had known the Goldfines for a quarter of a century , said he always had been unsuccessful in trying to pay the hotel bills . Senator Bridges earlier had acknowledged getting a vicufia coat as a gift from Mr. Goldfine . Senator Cotton also confirmed the week-end visit to the hotel with the Goldfines , who have a " cottage " at Hull , Mass . Earlier , when his name entered the inquiry , Senator Cotton had said he had an " understanding " with Mr. Goldfine that he would not ask him to do anything before Federal agencies concerned with any Goldfine enterprises . Mr. Goldfine told the subcommittee of his " cottage " : toddy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I paid $8,500 for it in 19211 , and have spent some money on improvements . " He explained - that since he could : - not put his- " important " friends and guests , including customers , in " a hole , " he had invited them to Plymouth , 1where he has as textile mill . Plant Given as Reason " I really wanted them to have a look at that plant , " he said . " It is the last plant- I bought in Massachusetts . I wanted to show it to the Senators and Governor Sherman Adams . I was proud ' to have men come down and stay with Mr. Cob:Rine for a week-erid . " The industrialist constantly refers to himself in the third person . His story ? caused Representative  --  rass to ? conunent that he had given " a most persuasive argument , were it not for the fact , " that he had charged the bills not as a personal expense but as a business expense . Usually , he went on , a purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when Mr. Goldfine made a business expense of the matter that " raises an entirely different question placing a different connotation on this action . " This caused their shouting with Mr. Goldfine contending his auditors should come down to discuss their bookkeeping and Mr. Moss asserting he was offering a defense with " no basis at all " and shirking responsibility .
