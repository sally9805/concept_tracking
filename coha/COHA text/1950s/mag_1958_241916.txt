From the world 's largest copper company last week came a dollars-and-cents confirmation of the industry 's slump . Kennecott reported 1957 earnings of $7.32 a share v. $13.23 in 1956 . The drop surprised few Wall Streeters , who are figuring on similar drops for Kennecott 's competitors . They estimate Anaconda earnings at slightly over $4 v. $12.85 m J956 and Phelps Dodge at around $4.40 v. $8.72 . Principal reason for the drop : a price slide that Kennecott 's President Charles R. Cox called a " debacle . " Three weeks ago Kennecott set the pace for domestic producers by dropping its price from 27 to 25 per lb. , lowest in five years and down 46% from the record 46.7 in March 1956 . On the London Metal Exchange , where world prices are set and fluctuate with daily sales , copper closed the week at 20.4 per lb. , 4.6 below the U.S. market . <P> The present price headaches are caused mainly by a hangover from a four-year spree . As demand began to soar in 1954 in the worldwide boom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened new mines . Copper supplies were still so short in 1956 ( after a 43-day U.S. strike in 1955 ) that free market prices in London were bid up to 54.6 . " Now , " says Kennecott 's Cox , " automotive production is down and so are housing starts . Utilities have slowed their expansion programs . Those are our three biggest customers . And there was that price ; when it climbed past 40 some of our customers began to bail out . I do n't mean to put the blame for that 46 price at everywhere else but this company 's door . I went along with the rest . Now we 're paying for it . " Copper producers are paying for it with surplus stocks ; domestic deliveries last year were 1,274,868 tons v. production of 1,613,907 . In December alone , deliveries were but 84,611 tons v. production of 136,135 . Only a steady European demand has saved the copper market from further drops . <P> Production Cuts .

Anaconda has sliced its Chilean production 10% , after cutting its Nevada mine output 16% . Phelps Dodge recently announced a 9% cut at its Arizona properties , representing a cumulative decrease of 22% since October 1956 . Two giant foreign producers , the Rhodesian Selection Trust and the Belgian Congo 's Union Minire du Haut Katanga have also trimmed operations 10%.
