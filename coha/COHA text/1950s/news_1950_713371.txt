txt In his speech at the Liberty Bell ceremonies in Independence , Mo. , President Truman again emphasized that Communist imperialism is a continuing menace to world peace , and that as long as this menace exists the free nations who would remain free have no other choice than to pool their strength and build up common defenses against it . In that connection he went out of his way to endorse anew the Schuman Plan for pooling West European coal and steel production . This endorsement was repeated in London by Ambassador Douglas , who , in his farewell speech , stressed that an adequate common defense of the West depends on an enduring reconciliation between France and Germany , and that this reconciliation could be found within the Schuman Plan . This double reiteration of the American standpoint is , of course , no accident . Rather it must be regarded as a concerted American move to speed the completion of the Schuman Plan , not only because of its economic merit but also in order to clear the path for speedier and more adequate West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make more urgent than ever . The basic organizational agreement on the Schuman Plan , which would put the West European coal and steel industries under supranational bodies , including a High Authority , a Council of Ministers , a Joint Assembly and a Court - of Justice as the first political foundations of a European federation , has been completed , and French Premier Pleven is confident that it will be signed " in the very near future . " This would provide an industrial basis for West European rearmament as nothing else could . But some last obstacles remain , and until these obstacles are removed the Schuman Plan threatens to become more a hindrance than a help to such rearmament . The French insist that the Schuman Plan agreement must be signed first before they will consent even to consider permitting the Germans to defend themselves or to contribute to the defense of the West . This French insistence is born of the suspicion that the German industrial boom , caused by Western rearmament , and the American plan for raising German divisions , provide an alternative to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept the Plan . The Germans , on the other hand , are equally insistent that they want the Schuman Plan as much as , ever and merely seek to straighten out some technical details to avert undue interference with their liberalized economy or . the payment of unwarranted subsidies to lessefficient countries . In these circumstances , the American pronouncements can only be viewed as urgent advice to both countries not to let details obstruct progress , and to regard the Schuman Plan and rearmament , not as alternatives but as parts of a larger whole on which depends their own survival and that of Western Europe . . By the same token , these pronouncements should also remove any fears that the United States might object to the single trading area projected by the Plan because of t most favored nation clause . The. ; fa that one of these pronouncements.w , made in London suggests similar a vice to the British either to join in t Schuman Plan or at least not to p ' any obstacles in its path .
