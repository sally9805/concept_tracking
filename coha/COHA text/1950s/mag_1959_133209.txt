That had n't happened in all of three previous seasons , because nobody in the Rocky Mountain Conference plays ball the way they do at State . With seven consecutive championships behind them , the Bengals are again a cinch for the title ; if any school hoped to catch Idaho State this year , it would have had to start building many seasons ago . Nobody did . In addition to that game , State lost its fine coach , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now at the University of Washington , facing a much tougher schedule , but the talent he left for his successor , Johnny Evans , and the winning tradition he built at Idaho , is immune to the present challenge . Evans has nine lettermen returning , at least two top-grade rookies and an outstanding marksman in transfer student Myrl Goodwin . Starting veterans are Center Homer Watkins , best shooter and rebounder on the team , Guard Alan Morris and Forward Raymond Griffith . They may be joined occasionally on a first five by sophomores Bob Blum and Frank Swopes , but there are many veteran reserves ( and Goodwin ) who will start often . They include Ron McNeley , Don O'Rourke , Don Kugler , Joe Germaine , Jim Link , Tom Mingus and Dennis Moulton . Everything a coach could want is here : good size , speed , shooting and strong rebounding . At COLORADO STATE the team that upset Idaho last year returns intact , exuding optimism . Coach John Bunn has arranged a tough early schedule , including Kentucky and Loyola of Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They will also be goaded on by the presence of several fine sophomores on the bench , eager to take their places . What this all will likely add up to , sadly , is second place , behind Idaho State . The all-veteran first five includes Theo Holland and Frank Carbajal in the backcourt , and Jim Hruska , Leon Johnson and Dick Daugherty up front . Experienced reserves are Bob Pratt , Al Sherman , Jerry Salmans , Jim Blewett and Bob Preisendorf . The best of the newcomers are Larry Balman , Bob Ruffin , Charles Hastings and Roy Betz . The floor balance is good , the over-all shooting better than average , but a major problem is board control . Hruska is the only strong rebounder ; Holland , only 6 feet tall , is second-best on the boards , hardly a good sign . Actually , Colorado State faces strong challenges for the runner-up spot from COLORADO COLLEGE , which has most of its regulars and key reserves back , including star performer Art Ackerman , and from ADAMS STATE , which has four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standout Center John Friem and Forward Lee Vickers . At Adams much-needed height is supplied by 6-foot-8 sophomore Jim Moore and transfers Jack Horn , 6 feet 6 , and Jim Davenport , 6 feet 5 . Two other newcomers who may start are backcourtmen John Blatnick and Garland Osborne . There is speed enough to take advantage of the board control the new tall men can supply . COLORADO WESTERN 'S Coach Willard Pederson survived a desperate personnel situation last season when he had a bare handful of players available . Now he has four of his regulars back , plus eight outstanding junior college transfers from whom to choose . The veteran starters are Gale Fillmore , an excellent floor-man but a weak shooter , Gary Peyton , Wally Rinehart and Richard Buck . The transfers , all between 6 feet 2 and 6 feet 6 , are Jim Homey , Al Tevis , Jim Bevers , Ken Barone , Lynn Faubian , Bill Welkner , Jay Ramthum and Bill Baugham . In early practice sessions the newcomers have shown good speed and shooting ability , especially Barone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's give-and-go style before becoming starters . COLORADO SCHOOL OF MINES has hopes of getting out of the cellar it has occupied so long , based on the presence of four returning regulars on a rather thin squad . The veterans are Center Bill Anderson , Guards Frank Patete and Bill Houston and Forward Dick Egen . The fifth starter will be either Gordon Van Sickle or George Clausen , which gives Coach Jim Darden fair average size if no really big man . Sophomore reserves are Brent Beer , Chuck Strain and Bill Flesner . This should be one of Colorado Mines ' better teams , but it is obviously not in the same class with Idaho State , and , like some other schools here , probably should not be in the same conference .
