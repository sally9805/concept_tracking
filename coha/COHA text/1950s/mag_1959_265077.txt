In the cold dark before winter dawn , by the TV screen 's eerie blue glare , the show 's rumpled star looks like an insomniac alchemist . With spectacles sliding down his nose , he brews electrons , protons and mesons while evoking Newton , Faraday , Planck , Einstein and Heisenberg . To watch NBC 's Continental Classroom ( 6:307 a.m. ) , some 275,000 Americans are sacrificing sleep for science five days a week . <P> Classroom was fathered last October by The American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education . It was mainly designed to upgrade science teaching in U.S. high schools , whose best teachers have long been lured by more money in industry . With NBC affiliates donating the early half-hour on 149 network stations ( 151 next semester ) , the $1,112,000 project was financed by the Ford Foundation and hefty grants from industry ( Bell Telephone , Standard Oil of California , General Foods , IBM , U.S. Steel , Pittsburgh Plate Glass ) . Some 250 colleges jumped aboard , signed up 5,000 regular students , who pay an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of credit ( depending on the college ) if they pass their exams . The first-semester finals are due this week . <P> Cosmic Cooking . But Classroom quickly exceeded its strictly academic goal . The first network educational TV class of any kind , the show is already approaching the ratings of later-rising Dave Garroway 's Today . Its 47-state audience now includes thousands of high school students , housewives , plumbers , executives , servicemen and even 500 San Quentin cons who happily find that physics does not a prison make . One 14-year-old boy on a Colorado ranch races forth before the show to catch it on his school TV set miles away . When the show conflicted with their devotions , the sisters in a Midwest convent switched their Mass time by special permission of the Mother House . <P> Part of Classroom 's success lies in the country 's post-Sputnik appetite for science . But the show could have been a nucleonic turkey without its M.C. : Dr. Harvey E. White , 57 , a top University of California physicist , who got the $38,000 yearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a TV high school physics course in Pittsburgh . A lanky , friendly , precise talker , Dr. White is no jazzy showman ; he drones at times like a farm agent exhaling a market report . Yet he somehow makes physics a sort of cosmic cooking course that can fascinate anyone . White 's secret is superb preparation : he spends twelve hours every day writing the script , building laboratory props and rehearsing with a 21-man crew . The preparation has to be right ; a faulty wire can delay an entire day 's lesson . <P> Nobel Flavor . Last week Classroom began expanding its faculty as well as its audience . Into White 's continental ivory lab came the first of seven Nobel prizewinners , Bell Telephone Physicist Walter H. Brattain , for a flawless if slightly baffling discourse on transistors . The other Nobelmen in a second semester devoted to atomic physics : Columbia University 's Dr. Polykarp Kusch ( March 9 ) , Caltech 's Dr. Carl D. Anderson ( May 6 ) , Columbia 's Dr. Isidor I. Rabi ( May 15 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of California 's chancellor , Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg ( May 29 ) , the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory 's director , Dr. Edwin M. McMillan ( June 4 ) .
