5 PENS IN HAND ( 360 pp. ) - Robert Graves-Doubleday ( $4.50 ) . <P> Gnaeus Robertulus Gravesa . . . was born in a suburban villa at the tenth milestone from Londinium , when L. Salisburi-us was sole Consul , in the year following the death of A. Tennisonianus Laureatus , whom the deified Victoria raised to patrician rank . It is handed down that the infant wore a beastlike scowl , which already gave assurance of ... a mute and cynical habit of mind . <P> - From Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus ' Lives of the Britannic Poets . Translation by W. Wadlington Postchaise . <P> In this spoof of Roman historians and their stuffy translators , Robert Graves makes two major misstatements about himself . He is not cynical , being far too intelligent and benign for that , and he is certainly not mute , being one of the most relentlessly prolific authors now at work . The book jacket of his latest collection of miscellaneous pieces says , " There is only one Robert Graves , " but this is patently untrue . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , essayist , general literary pundit and japester . All of them in this thoroughly entertaining volume are in top form . <P> According to Baudelaire 's definition of a superior man- " He is not a specialist " - Robert Graves is distinctly superior . He has strongly held , closely reasoned , occasionally absurd opinions on everything under the sun and-considering his longstanding infatuation with the lunar White Goddess-on everything under the moon too . Not the least fascinating thing about this book is his delight in the sound of his own voice , whether he writes about the Whitaker Negroes , * a child peer of England , Saint Paul , E. E. Cummings , U.S. education , nightmares or poetry . <P> Lei , Lee . Nothing is better fun for the nonscholarly reader than Graves 's vast sneer at the scholarly mind , given at a Yale lecture . In this mock-solemn legpull , Graves gravely gives a pathologicon of pedants ' diseases . Sample : cacography , i.e. , bad writing , a scholarly affliction that leads to " the inability of college graduates to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affliction , Graves recommends a Demosthenic treatment : " Fill the sufferer 's mouth with pebbles and make him explain his theories in simple language to a mixed audience of Texan cowhands and Boston longshoremen . " <P> A vastly if casually learned man himself ( he lets on that he graduated from Oxford only by an " arrangement " with the regius professor of English literature ) , Graves suggests that even as a schoolboy he could not resist the temptation to make light of learning . He declined the name of Mr. Lees , the Latin master , as " Lees , Lees , Lem , Lei , Lei , Lee . " *
