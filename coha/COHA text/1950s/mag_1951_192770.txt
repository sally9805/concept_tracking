The dangers of a great city , like those of the jungle , often leave little time for thought . When smoke boiled into her 1-room Brooklyn flat one morning last week , Mrs. Irma Randall did not hesitate . A kerosene stove had tipped over downstairs and flame was roaring up the stairway in solid sheets . After one look , she ran to the window . <P> Five of her nine children were safely in school . The 32-year-old mother helped her three little boys out to the narrow roof of a bay window , 30 feet above the street , picked up her blanket-wrapped baby , and climbed out herself . A yelling crowd was gathering in the street below . Mrs. Randall dropped the baby 's blanket to three men and a woman on the sidewalk and called to them to hold it up . She dropped her children one by one . The first three landed without a scratch . But the fourth , James , who was eight , was heavy . He slipped from the blanket and hit the sidewalk-safe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , the crowd began yelling , " Do n't jump ! Do n't jump ! " She stood there in the increasing heat in a long cotton housecoat and a pair of men 's shoes and hopped from one foot to the other , frightened , ludicrous and heroic at once . A neighbor rushed up with an extension ladder , got it against the side of the building and started up . Then thick smoke and flame burst out of the windows below the woman . It drove the man off the ladder and enveloped her . She sank to the ledge and lay still . She was dead when firemen arrived , 30 minutes after the blaze had begun .
