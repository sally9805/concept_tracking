The housekeeper at Chicago 's Conrad Hilton hotel , although outwardly neutral like all the hotel employees , is wearing ( according to Ikemen ) an Eisenhower button on her slip . That is one of the latest eve-of-battle bulletins from Chicago , as the city braces for C-day amid tornadoes of campaign literature , jungles of telephone wire , rivers of ice water and the thunderous fizz of headache powders . <P> A Big Factor . On the Hilton 's ninth floor , a huge photograph of Bob Taft proclaims to visitors that they are entering Taft headquarters . Jack Martin ( 908-A ) , Taft 's executive assistant , is not missing any details . " The elevator service is a big factor , " he says . " A lot may depend on whether a delegation can get upstairs or not . " <P> Two floors above , Senator Lodge is presiding over Eisenhower GHQ . The place is plastered with 300 Ike pictures and blossoming with other Ike propaganda , including a necktie ( worn by Press Secretary Jim Hagerty ) that proclaims " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ike , " " Fr mich Ike , " and so on , in 27 languages , all told . <P> Ikeman Ronald Welch is brooding over convention arrangements . His notebook is crammed with entries ranging from bands , calliope , " banner-towing helicopters , " TV sets and tea parties to " impromptu demonstrations . " The plans for " impromptu demonstrations " are only slightly less elaborate than those of another Eisenhower staff for D-day eight years ago . <P> Chicago is blas about conventions , and professes to see little difference between politicos , Elks and fertilizer salesmen , but the city is nevertheless pulling its sprawling self together . Traffic to the convention hall ( near Chicago 's stockyards ) is being rerouted , streetcleaners are busier than they have been for years , and cops have orders to be polite for a few days . Police also announced that " the lid " would be clamped on in Clark Street 's numerous strip joints , though Chicago lids have a way of not staying on much more firmly than a stripper 's bra . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 11,000 rooms to the Republicans . The Blackstone ( where Eisenhower will stay ) has produced such cocktails as the Eisenhower Eye-Opener ( whisky sour ) , the Taft Teaser ( Manhattan ) and the Dark Horse ( old fashioned ) . The Palmer House , mindful of the footwork delegates will have to do , is putting a bottle of foot lotion into each room . A major tourist attraction last week was the new eight-room , $40,000 presidential suite at the Congress Hotel where hundreds of visitors , held back by museum-like ropes , gazed at the master parlor and bar , the mahogany beds , the solid-gold faucet handles in the bathroom . In this suite Bob Taft is staying . <P> As delegates began to arrive , William ( " Doc " ) Reid , 73 , Republican committeeman of Chicago 's tough 16th ward for 36 years , issued some advice to conventiongoers : " Take your wife . Every candidate has a headquarters you can leave her at for entertainment while you go someplace else ... Take three or four extra shirts and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiping off perspiration . Bring along a box of your own brand of cigars . The kind they pass out at conventions are no good . "
