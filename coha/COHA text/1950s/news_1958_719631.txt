Three Big Questions Three issues have preoccupied the American people during the past six months  --  the recession , the negotiations on summit talks and the race for outer space . Washington 's moves in connection with each reverberate around the world . The U. S. holds the key to whether or not there will be summit talks and a possible alleviation of East-West tensions . A. major economic slump in the United States would be , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political disaster " for the free world . The United States ' ability to keep pace with the Russians in the race for outer space may determine whether Communism or the free nations dominate the earth . How does the rest of the world view the United States position on each of the three issues ? Last week New York Times correspondents cabled answers from major world capitals . In most capitals , they reported , the three issues engaging U. S. attention were of considerable concern . Unlike the U. S. , they ranked the summit question instead of the recession as first in urgency . In some capitals local concerns took precedence . The French , for exAmple , were wrapped up in their North African problems and internal political tensions ; the Italians , in the forthcoming national elections this spring ; the Arabs , in the rapidly shifting realignments among the countries of the Middle East . Nevertheless , in Government circles and among the politically educated groups generally there Was deep awareness of the potential impact on world affairs of the U. S. recession , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the gist of the reports from The Times correspondents . RECESSION While the U. S. recession was being watched closely in most world capitals , it has had little impact thus far on other national economies . The British had anticipated a decline in their exports to the U. S. in the light of reduced American purchasing power . But last month British exports to the U. S. were at the highest level on record . Unemployment has risen slightly in Britain , but it still represents only 1.9 per cent of the work force . France , as an importer of raw materials , thus far was benefiting from the U. S. slump . The French economy continued to run against the world current with all indices mounting and the main Government pm-occupation is the fight against inflation rather than the reverse . The French were aware , however , that a continued economic decline in the U. S. could undermine France 's economic boom . Boom in Germany West Germany was still enjoying virtually full employment and a steady domestic demand . Exports were up sharply in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were some indications , however , that the boom was leveling off . In Italy , there has been a decrease in unemployment and a substantial increase in industrial activity over the past three months as compared with 1957 . The Italians , however , said The Times correspondent in Rome , were " living in the shadow of fear that the American recession may spread to Italy if it lasts beyond the middle of the year . " Among the Asian and Middle East nations , it was the Japanese who were watching the U. S. economy most anxiously . Japan exports heavily to the U. S. and news of the American recession has been prominently headlined almost daily in the Japanese press . Partly as a result of over-expanMon during last year 's boom , all Japanese industries have been caught with inflated inventories and workers are being laid off as production is cut as much as 30 per cent in textiles , mining and other fields . Elsewhere in Asia , the principal concern was that the U. S. slump might result in a severe cutback in economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. recession was grist for the Soviet propaganda mill . " ' We pity the poor unemployed , ' is the Soviet atti , tilde , " said The Times correspond , ent , " ' but we told you so . ' " A. F. L.-C . I. 0 . President George Meany , often denounced in the Soviet press as a tool of the capitalists , is now being given generous and welcome space as he warns that the recession is deepening . Soviet chief Nikita Khrushchev said recently that he wants young Russians to learn about capitalism " not from Khrushchev but from Meany . " SUMMIT Reaction in free world capitals to the U. S. position on the summit talks suggested that there was less criticism about U. S. caution , and more skepticism about Soviet intentions than a month ago . In Britain , the Government expects a summit meeting by September , and feels rile U. S. may be a little too insistent on full exploration of all the issues in advance . At the same time , British officials believe the U. S. stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make concessions to obtain the summit talks it claims it wants so badly . But the British Government is being hard-pressed by an opposition campaign for early summit talks and there is still a wide gap between the Government 's official position and popular feeling on the issue . In West Germany , the majority of people were reported resigned to the fact that Washington will not be able to hold out for German unification as a condition for any summit agreement . " The West Germans seem to feel that talks are better than doing nothing , " the New York Times correspondent cabled from Bonn . " They hope that at least the chiefs of Government can make some progress on the disarmament issue . " In Paris , there was the habitual French nervousness about the planned United States-British tote-a-tote when Prime Minister Harold Macmillan comes to Washington in June . The French Foreign Office agrees with Washington that a summit conference must be well prepared , but must be prepared in common , not by an AngloAmerican " directorate . " The Italians , too , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasize that the meeting must not be a " sideshow . " With the exception of India , the summit issue appeared to have aroused little interest in the AfroAsian world . From New Delhi , the New York Times correspondent cabled : " It is interesting to note that the Indians so far have deftly turned down suggestions front Tito and Moscow that they put pressure on the United States to hurry . This does not , of course , change the fact that the Indians think the Soviet approach is more reasonable than Washington 's . " In Russia , according to the New York Times correspondent , Soviet propaganda on a summit conference has been so insistent that " a good many people around the country are earnestly asking why the United States is n't rushing to the meeting . " OUTER SPACE World reaction to the satellite race was summed up by one Times correspondent as , " The score is now 2 to 2 in favor of the Russians . " The comment reflects the feeling that the Russians , by virtue of having got into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the more impressive achievement . The Times correspondent in Paris cabled that " the biggest change since last fall is the growing conviction that it is only a matter of time before the United States catches up and passes the Soviets in space . " In West Germany , Vanguard was said to have revived interest in the satellite race and alleviated the fear that the United States was hopelessly behind Russia . On the other hand , the West German press has been warning that Moscow may have more and bigger surprises up its sleeve . " The space competition , " cabled The Times correspondent from Rome , " is being watched by the Italians in much the same way as spectators on the sidelines watch a football match . But they are relieved at the feeling that their ' team ' is still in the game . " The Japanese were said to be greatly disquieted ( by the Soviet lead because they feel that the sputniks " have a dreadful military connotation . " Indians ' View From India , The Times correspondent cabled that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviets took the lead in the space race . " This arose from a rather natural delight in seeing a big shot humbled a bit . Indians , however , are much more concerned with the military implications of the space race than with how many are up there from each side . " In Russia , The Times correspondent summed up the official Soviet attitude as " Our Sputnik weighs half a ton ; theirs weighs three pounds  --  next question ? " Mr. Khrushchev told a group of visiting Americans last week that the United States henceforth will always lag behind the Soviets scientifically . Nothing is being reported in the Soviet press to undermine the rosy outlook . 0 World reaction to the United States ' problems , in turn , had its effect on Washington . There was awareness in the Administration , and in Congress , of the criticism from abroad on certain aspects of U.S. policy and leadership . In response , there have been some modifications in the U.S. stand , notably On the issue of disarmament and the initial toughness toward summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the United States ' allies . They were based on a feeling in some quarters that the allies are letting the United States carry the ball in the contest with Russia , while reserving for themselves the comparatively easy role of critics . There were also divisions within the U.S. on how to deal with the recession , the summit negotiations , and the outer space race . Washington was acutely aware of the potential domestic political impact of a continued economic slump . Within the Administration , there continued to be divided counsel on how far to go in meeting the Russians on the question of disarmament and a suspension of nuclear tests . The Democrats , for the time being , had eased up on the pressure for greater efforts in the missile and earth satellite fields ; but the issue was far from settled and could easily burst out into the open again with news of a new Russian achievement in rocketry .
