A Way to Balance Big Labor 's Power <P> As the United Auto Workers aggressively presented their new wage demands to Ford and Chrysler last week , Detroit 's worried automakers got some sound advice from Harvard University . Said Economist Sumner Slichter : " The auto companies would be wise to maintain a united front that would sooner or later lead to industry-wide bargaining . " <P> Slichter touched a major problem for dozens of U.S. industries : they must either stand together or risk being whipsawed by unions . In many cases labor and management no longer sit as equals at the bargaining table . While big labor keeps a united front , management does not , and frequently comes off second best as one company is played against another . This weakening of industry 's bargaining power is a big factor in rising prices , pushed higher and higher by wage boosts . <P> One of the best arguments for industry-wide bargaining is the way the idea has worked in practice . Of more than 125,000 collective-bargaining agreements in effect last year , roughly one-third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiated between labor unions and groups of employers . Though only a few businesses , such as the garment industry ( TIME , March 17 ) , bargain on what amounts to an industry-wide scale , dozens of others negotiate contracts through associations of from two to 20 or more companies . The trend is particularly strong in service and construction industries , where both union and management groups like the idea so well that they have asked the Administration to guarantee the right of industry-wide bargaining . <P> <P> To many a small company , collective employer bargaining is vital : no small businessman has a chance alone against a powerful union . Employer associations can not only pool resources , but also save employers ' time and money by bargaining for them . The mammoth steel industry practices a highly useful form of industrywide bargaining , though it boggles at any formal association of companies . After a bad strike in 1946 , U.S. Steel Corp . sat down in 1947 with the union and hammered out a contract setting a pattern that the rest of the industry has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toughest in the industry , negotiates on an industry-wide basis for most of the 22 integrated steel companies ; before granting union demands , Steel takes care to consider its colleagues , who in turn back it up . <P> In other industries , a few of the biggest companies have also banded together for mutual protection . Libby-Owens-Ford and Pittsburgh Plate Glass , which comprise 95% of the plate-glass industry , got tired of seeing their wage scales leapfrog because of individual bargaining , feel that they have done much better since they decided to bargain together after a strike in 1936 . Said a Pittsburgh Plate Glass executive : " We saw it as a means of protecting ourselves against the union 's whipsawing tactics . " <P> Some unions also favor industrywide bargaining on the principle that employers can then no longer play off one local against another . But many union leaders oppose it , recognizing that it minimizes labor 's ability to play one employer against the other . <P>                @ @ @ @ @
