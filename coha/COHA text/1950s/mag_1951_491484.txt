ELECTION DAY brought . Gregory Stebbins a warm , satisfied feeling . An organizer for the steelworkers , Stebbins had led the doorbell offensive to unseat Sen. Robert A. Taft in the Seventeenth Ward of Columbus , Ohio . With seventy helpers , he had canvassed every house in the ward , stuffing mailboxes with anti-Taft leaflets and exhorting people not to miss voting in the " political battle of the century . " When , on November seventh , crowded polling booths indicated a record turnout , Stebbins glowed . Going to bed before the ward returns were available , he felt serenely confident the Seventeenth had turned out its usual heavy Demo " cratic majority . Because Stebbins left town early the next morning , it was several days before he could check the ward results . He was astounded . Probably three fourths of Ward Seventeen 's families are union members , mainly railroaders and steelworkers . Not many of their frame houses would bring more than $10,000 , even in today 's inflated markets . Yet sizable majority had voted for " labor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bewildered , Stebbins called in his union stewards , but none could explain what had happened . Three weeks later . when I saw him , he said , " I still do n't understand it . We thought we needed only to get out the vote . Well , the vote came out , but it went against us . " Stebbins , of course , was not alone in being mystified by what one newsman has termed the " Taft miracle . " How did Taft , long regarded as such a poor vote Ketter , roll up the sixth . largest plurality in Ohio history ? Does his 430,000 majority in a state Truman won by only 7107 votes in 1948 presage a Republican presidential victory in 1952 , with Taft perhaps the GOP standard bearer ? It is an American habit to forget our elections , once they are over . But an understanding of what caused the Taft landslide could be of crucial importance . Over the next two years fearful decisions will have to be made by a fearfully balanced Congress and presidency . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what agitated the voters last November . Were the Democratic setbacks merely normal off-year losses ? Was the Fair Deal repudiated ? Does it mean , as the Chicago Tribune exulted , that Americans do not fear the word " isolationist , " but actually " esteem it " ? Why They Voted as They Diil T HERE seemed one way to get at the answers to these and related questions , and that was from the voters themselves . Immediately after the voting the Post sent me into Ohio for an unusual type of postelection survey . For weeks I crisscrossed the state , through most of the major cities and typical farm counties . Everywhere I went I compared Taft 's vote with that of Truman 's two years ago ? county by county , ward by ward , precinct by precinct . Having determined where the greatest inroads into the President 's strength occurred , I then went out into these neighborhoods and townships . talking to ward leaders and precinct workers , farmers , housewives , storekeepers and union members . Why had so many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? For whom . would they vote in 1952 ? What I found left no doubt that Taft 's surprising majority reflects far more than " local conditions , " in President Truman 's phrasing . True , much of that majority can rightly be credited to Taft 's opponent . Shortly after " Jumping Joe " Ferguson won the Democratic primary last spring , a canny Ohioan observed , " If the Democrats want to win , they should send Ferguson on a mission abroad . " Ferguson 's habit of slipping on grammatical banana peels repelled many voters . Others whom I interviewed could n't recall his name . Even those kindly disposed felt , " Joe is a nice guy and okay for state auditor , but I would n't want him in Washington with war threatening . " Another Ferguson handicap  --  though a small one  --  was his being a Catholic . In Akron , which draws many workers from the South , one minister openly exhorted his congregation to vote Protestant . A Youngstown dairy worker told me that he had been divided in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continued from Page 33 ) to heat Bob Taft . " Right there , two dairy workers told me , " We decided to vote for Taft . " In Cincinnati , a cutter ? he belonged to the Amalgamated Clothing Workers , the home union of Jack Kroll , who heads the CIO 's Political Action Cominittee ? complained , " Sure we elect our union officers by secret ballot , but there 's only one slate to vote on . That 's like Russia . " Two years ago , this cutter had opposed the Taft-Hartley Law . " I 'm for it now , " he said . " There have been fewer strikes . When other workers strike , business drops and we get laid off . " A machinist who belonged to a company union liked the Taft-Hartley ban on the closed shop . " It means if I quit my job I can go to work elsewhere , " he said . A drop-forger in Toledo remarked , " Under the Wagner Act the union bosses had the upper hand . If you said something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now you are protected . " One union head told me , " We could n't convince the workers Taft-Hartley is a ' slave-labor law . ' They 've been living with it for three years and nothing really had has happened to t hem . " Part way through the campaign , the labor chieftains tried to soft-pedal Taft-Hartley as an issue . But Taft kept hammering at it . He carried the fight directly to the workers , visiting more than 300 plants . Efforts to turn these visits into anti-Taft demonstrations backfired repeatedly . In one factory , on the day Taft was scheduled to speak , a union official appeared and stuck a Ferguson button on every worker 's overalls . I found that probably half of that . force voted for Taft . When Taft came to Campbell Sheet and Tube in Youngstown , the local CIO chief ordered a walkout of the power unit . Before operations were resumed several thousand men had lost almost . a full day 's pay . Their anger was written , hot and loud , into the vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are mainly millworkers . Truman got 56 per cent of their vote in 1948 . Taft got 63 per cent in 1950 . It was n't difficult to find workers in these precincts who had voted for Truman two years ago and had swung for Taft . Their reasoning was summed up fairly well by one white-haired mill hand . " I did n't like the CIO shutting the mill , " he told me as we stood by his open door . " And I do n't like the war . We ought n't to be fighting in a place like Korea , so far from home , losing all those boys , and not on the real enemy . I 've been a Democrat , but I 'm ready to vote Republican . We need to clean house in Washington . There must be some communists in the Government or the newspapers would n't be printing all those charges . " Until recently , this millworker had been planning to retire . " With all this inflation , " he complained , " I do n't know what my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Down the street , Richard Bates , Jr. , a gunner in the last war , got . out the orders calling up his reserve unit . Quite philosophic about going back into service ? " by getting in now , I figure I 'll get out earlier " ? Bates did not blame Truman for the Korean war . A Truman voter in 1948 , he voted this time for Taft . " I did n't like that kid stuff the union pulled , like shutting the mill , and that . comic book , " he said . " Then they beat up Skinny Greenwood next door for campaigning for Taft . " Two other workers nearby used the term " childish " in criticizing the union 's tactics . Oddly , the campaign comic book which irritated them was expertly done . Employing the format and style of such ten-cent favorites as Li'l Abner and Donald Duck , it purported to tell how a pompous , mustachioed " J. P. Moneybags " was conspiring to re-elect Taft by suppressing those parts of Taft 's record which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed . One Republican campaigner said , " The comic book hurt us badly at first . But it was put out too early in the campaign , which gave us time to counteract it . " Not only did labor 's pounding alienate many factory workers but it helped to solidify the normal Republican vote . In fact , the essence of Taft 's strategy appears to have been a gamble on being re-elected by his enemies . The Taft forces drummed insistently on the theme of " outside political carpetbaggers " coming into Ohio with " unlimited funds " to " tell Ohioans how to vote . " They reprinted and circulated the more abusive attacks on Taft made by labor leaders . One , which became a virtual Republican battle slogan , was the boast of James Caesar Petrillo , the head of the musicians ' union , " There will be nothing we wo n't do to knock your ( Taft 's ) silly head out of the U. S. Senate and keep it out . " A sampling of Akron 's strongest Democratic and Republican precincts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their registration than did the Democrats . In Cleveland only seven of every ten registered voters went to the polls ; in the heavily Republican suburbs it was eight out of ten . The zeal that brought out that extra suburbanite can be imagined from the case of Mrs. Samuel Beatty , of Cleveland Heights . In 1948 Mrs. Beatty was having a baby and did n't vote . Lying in the hosFebruar:i 10. 1951 pital the day after election , she heard a radio announcer say that Dewey could have carried the state with " only one more Republican " at each of Ohio 's 9500 voting places . " That was my vote that was missing , " Mrs. Beatty muttered to herself . Next time , she vowed , she would vote , come what may . When the Taft-Ferguson election rolled around , Mrs. Beatty was pregnant again . Her calendar indicated that she would be in the hospital on November seventh . She obtained an absentee ballot , but overlooked having the ballot notarized . She did n't discover the oversight until the Friday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in by noon . Frantic , she called Mrs. Robert Hornung , a transplanted Bostonian , who 123 Republican woman leader in Cleveland Heights . By the time Mrs. Hornung could locate a notary and get to the hospital , it was a quarter to twelve . It was raining and the board of elections was a good five miles away in downtown Cleveland . Mrs. Hornung 's dash through traffic must , have been spectacular . As she pulled up before the elections board , the bells of St. John 's Cathedral were tolling the noon hour . Racing upstairs , she flung the ballot on a clerk 's desk and gasped , " The bells are still ringing ! Technically , it 's still noon ! " The shrewdness with which this Taftor-die spirit was fanned should demolish any belief that Taft is not a skilled politician . Private polls taken monthly by Lou Guylay , his publicity director . showed Taft getting 60 per cent of the vote . ( His actual vote was 57 per cent . ) These polls were secreted from not only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mindful of the overconfidence that overwhelmed Dewey two years ago , Taft preferred to " run scared . " Once , when his prospects looked too rosy , wor - d went down the line , " Put out ' pessimism . " Many Republicans felt themselves figuratively manning the barricades . One told me , " If Taft lost , it would have meant the end of the two-party system . " From another , " If labor had beaten a man like Taft with somebody like Ferguson , it would have been the end of our democracy and freedom . From the outset , the Taft command , headed by Willis Gradison , a Cincinnati investment broker , Paul Walter . a Cleveland attorney , and Ray Bliss , the state GOP chairman , saw the caul ' paign as " a great doorbell-ringing contest , " with victory likely to hinge upon which side got out its vote . The Taft organization  --  probably the best OW has ever seen  --  was two years in the building . It extended down into every precinct in the state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voting trends indicated that the Republicans could expect to win more than 70 per cent of all doctors , lawyers , auto dealers , and Rotary and Kiwanis club members , but only 43 per cent of the grocers . No effort was made to induce grocers to register . With the other groups , organization lists were oh ? tained and every member was visited and revisited until his name was on the poll books . Another illustration of Republican thoroughness was the effort to get out the vote of Ohio 's increasing Amlab , population . As part of their withdrawsl from the materialistic world ? no orthodox Amishman uses electricity nr owns an automobile  --  many Amish have traditionally refrained from voting , except on tax and school issues . ( gone ' ed on Page 144 ) ( Continued from Page 142 ) Last fall a group of Holmes County doctors with a large Amish practice asked nineteen Amish bishops in the area to urge their fellow religionists to come out and vote against " socialized , medicine . " The appeal was based less on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular among many Amish-than upon personal trust in the doctors serving them . This unusual appeal was moderately effective . The numbers of Amish voting swelled somewhat , but not spectacularly . Among those who drove their high , boxlike buggies to the polls , however , Taft got more than the usual Republican vote . He carried most Amish townships by five to one . One Amishman who helped swell Taft 's total was Sam Schrock , who operates a furniture factory outside of Walnut Creek . Schrock favored Taft because " labor wants too much " and because " I know Taft is not for war . " Asked whom he favored for President in 1952 , Schrock shook his head and replied , " I do n't know yet whether I 'll vote . Amish people are pacifists . We do n't like to vote for President . If he declared war , we would feel guilty . " In general throughout the state the fall-off in Democratic strength was greater than the Republican gains . Still there was much more to Taft 's victory than a failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a near-record Republican turnout . If Ferguson limped 241,000 votes behind Truman two years ago , Taft spurted 196,000 ahead of Dewey 's tally . Hidden in those figures was a highly significant change of political heart among many who voted for Truman in 1948 . Only one of the traditional New Deal elements really held firm against Taft - the Negro . In colored wards in Cincinnati , Toledo and Cleveland , the Democratic vote fell by one fifth to one third , yet Taft drew fewer votes than Dewey . The barriers Taft could n't surmount were his opposition to a compulsory **25;4091;TOOLONG law and the fact that the younger Negro leaders still pin their faith to the Democratic Party . Among virtually all the other Democratic elements Taft picked up strength , registering particularly impressive gains among such ardent supporters of Franklin Roosevelt as railroaders , Jewish voters and low-income city dwellers . This cracking of the old Roosevelt front-something Dewey failed to accomplish-can be credited to two main factors . First , the aura of being Roosevelt 's successor , which Truman has enjoyed , is fading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a big job , " was an oft-expressed comment . Second , over the last two years there has been a striking change in the fears haunting the nation .. In 1948 the balloting was overshadowed by the dread of another depression ; the specters hovering over the polling booths last November were of war and inflation . In plugging for a Congress which would support his 1948 program , Truman failed to realize that the Fair Deal has been dead for months , a casualty of the Korean war . One of the biggest Taft " surprises , " for example , was his carrying of a number of " poor man 's " precincts like one in the Seventeenth Ward in Columbus , which lies on the wrong side of the railroad tracks , with old homes worth only a few thousand dollars and sorely in need of painting . In both Chicago and Indianapolis , which I studied before going into Ohio , 1 found similar areas , ordinarily strongly Democratic , which also swung Republican . In all of these unpainted houses the pattern of protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to age so long without a refreshing coat of paint reveals how close to the margin these families live . The younger people were in revolt over the increase in the withholding tax which went into effect last October . The older folk were bitter about rising prices which cut their savings cruelly . A bus driver 's wife complained , " My husband got a ten-cents-an-hour wage increase , but with the new tax we wound up forty-two cents behind in pay . I voted for Taft . Europe can go jump in the lake . " A printer 's wife protested ism , " the Brannan Plan and " socialized medicine . " It seemed strange hearing that kind of Republican talk at that income level , but it happened in many of these unpainted houses . With the shock of having to shave living budgets to pay higher taxes has come an angry turn against all forms of Government spending . As a matter of fact , the threat of inflation seems to have brought a similar shift against too much Government among all groups of voters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been this failure to sense that inflation is no longer " smart politics . " The strong Taft swing among railroadmen largely reflected resentment against Truman 's handling of rail labor disputes . But it also represented the fears voiced by one trainman nearing retirement , " I worked nearly thirty years to build up an annuity , and now what 's it going to be worth ? " Two years ago , in doing a postmortem for the Post on Truman 's surprising victory , I found that his chief asset among ordinarily conservative voters was the fear of another depression . With farm prices dropping , many farmers told me they thought it too risky to vote for Dewey , who had not spelled out what he would do in case of a depression . Since early summer , howeVer , the outlook has been one of rising , not falling prices . With this altered pros- This same desire for a " check upon the Administration " was expressed by numerous other voters in middle-income precincts . Even persons who disagreed with Taft saw his militant independence as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cleveland , a Socialist , who voted for Henry Wallace in 1948 , conceded , " Taft is a lot more conservative than I am . But I believe his conservatism has served a constructive purpose . It is n't good for one party to be in power too long . " In campaigning as if 1950 were still 1948 , Truman appears to have repeated Dewey 's mistake of failing to come to grips with the problems really troubling the people . How much of a mandate on foreign policy was the Taft . vote ? Relatively little , in my judgment , beyond demonstrating a general emptiness of confidence in the Administration . It was not a vote for any specific change in foreign policy , since none was debated . A Cleveland schoolteacher remarked , " I voted for Taft despite misgivings as to his foreign policy , " which was the attitude of other voters as well . But I also heard a Knox County farmer  --  Leonard Leedy ? boom out , " I voted for Taft , but I 'm dead against him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my kind . But I 'm off Truman for giving all that stuff away to Europe . " Among some voters , Taft 's old isolationist opposition to Roosevelt was an asset . Yet , one of Taft 's most dramatic gains came in Jewish areas , where Roosevelt 's memory still gleams untarnished . In part this shift can he credited to Taft 's long record of friendliness to Jewish aspirations for Israel . Several of Ohio 's leading rabbis endorsed him . Another factor of long-term significance should not be overlooked . All through the Roosevelt years , Jewish voters as a group were more strongly Democratic than other voters at the same economic levels . This trend is now readjusting itself . The process of realignment could be seen clearly in Avondale , a Jewish resi.dential section in Cincinnati , where Taft scored his greatest gains in the entire city . Like the Bronx in New York City , Avondale was settled in a series of northward pushes , the better-income families pressing steadily towards the greener , near-suburban pastures . As a result , Avondale is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economically as one climbs to its northern tip , where $30,000 homes are common . In 1944 Roosevelt swept every precinct . Four years later Dewey carried the upper two thirds of Avondale . Taft won not only this area but the four northernmost precincts which Truman had carried . When I went into these precincts , with homes ranging from $6500 to $10,000 , I found the Taft shift mainly among small-business and white-collar elements  --  a lawyer , a grocer , Government employees  --  not among factory workers . Home owners also favored Taft more than renters did . What of the reported " resurgence of Midwestern isolationism ? " To check this , I visited counties in Iowa and Minnesota as well as Ohio , where Roosevelt 's vote dropped most violently in 1940 , after the outbreak of war . All these THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 10 , 1951 areas , it developed , were strongly German-American in background . All also showed a spectacular Democratic pickup in 1948 . In Putnam County , Ohio , for example , Roosevelt 's share of the two-party vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop in the state . Truman picked up 22 per cent in 1948 ? again the largest . change . " I 'll never vote for a Democratic President again ! " raged one farmer near Columbus Grove . " They alsVays bring wars . Ca n't we have good times without war ? " Another farmer remarked , " We would n't be in this mess if we had minded our own business in 1917 . " But if some saw the Korean war as a vindication of their past isolationism , others who opposed our entry into the last war supported Truman 's action in Korea . My net judgment was that the Korean fighting has given flame to some of the old isolationist coals , but that much of that sentiment has remained dead ashes . The many emotional currents which have swirled into the whirlpool of frustration in which the people are caught are not easily described . Take an elderly farm couple  --  the Leon Hunters  --  near North Liberty in Knox County , Ohio . The Hunters seemed glad of a chance to air their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she had baked the day before for her rug-knitting club and we talked for quite a time . Silicosis had forced Hunter to leave a factory job in Mansfield and take up farming , Strong for unions in the past and always Democratic , he had voted for Taft because , he said , " It is n't good for labor to have too much power " and because " Truman and Acheson are too soft with the communists . " " Why does n't Truman get rid of those communists in the Government ? " demanded Mrs. Hunter . " With our boys dying , he wo n't kick out the people who are fighting us  --  it snakes you sick ! " Hunter was against all farm subsidies . " I co-operated one year and had to make five trips to town to get thirty-eight dollars in benefits , " he said . " The farm program does n't help little farmers like me . " Like everyone else I talked with , the Hunters felt that there was no chance of agreement with Russia , but were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor were they content with the present twilight state of limited war . " We ought to do something to show those Russians where they get off , " said Hunter . " When Malik and Vishinsky say those things about us in EASY TO MURDER ( Continued from Page 45 ) improvise . With Kim , she would follow a carefully-thought-out plan . Thinking about it , she felt her pulses quicken , begin to pound . Kim 's death could hold the same kind of enjoyment Cullen 's had . The same feeling of power . Onalee opened the smallest drawer of her desk . Seemingly innocent enough , it contained brush , comb , several untouched bottles of name-brand perfumes , several other bottles with carefully typed labels , skin softeners , and so on .

But even then Onalee would only have to say that they were sold to her as skin preparations . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slap their faces ! " As I got ready to leave , Hunter tried to sum up his feelings , " I guess what I 've been trying to say is that it 's time we got back to the American way of life , " he said . One of the important adercurrents of the election was a patriotic frustration which lashed out at things " alien " and rallied around Taft as an American symbol . This common feeling of frustration , so evident everywhere , differs markedly from the mood of 1946 . Then , of course , the Democrats suffered even heavier losses , and yet , two years later , upset the overconfident Republicans . But the voters ' revolt of 1946 was born mainly of sudden angers , such as vexations over the meat shortage . Like a summer storm , it burst with much flash and bang , but passed by quickly . The protest registered last November has the quality of a wintry siege , born of war-darkened skies , biting taxes and prices , the icy suspicion that communist treachery still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the temperature of confidence in Truman 's ability to measure up to the towering problems ahead . Whenever I found someone who backed Truman two years ago and Taft last fall , I asked , " In voting for Taft , did you feel you were also voting against Truman ? Whom would you vote for in 1952 ? " Roughly a third of these Truman-Taf t voters definitely had not voted " against the President . " Perhaps one of four , though , was ready to support any Republican in 1952 . Of the possible GOP nominees , General Eisenhower pulls strongest , with Taft next and Harold Stassen weakest . California 's Earl Warren usually brought a " don't-knowhim " reply . Many Taft supporters frankly felt that he ought to stay in the Senate . Others wanted to see what he will do in the next two years . By far the greatest turn against Truman has come among independent voters in the middle class , teachers , shopkeepers , white-collar workers and little businessmen . The " we-need-achange " feeling was somewhat weaker among farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's prestige has sunk dismally low . The results of this survey would indicate that it is in the shift of the ' farmers and urban middle class that one must search for the longer-range significance of Taft 's triumph . His surprisingly large labor vote can not be counted upon to repeat itself in 1952 . For the Republicans to win , they 11104 figure upon holding these independent voters on the farms and in the cinea who favored Truman two years 1:10'i but now feel the " Democrats have been in too long . " Contrasting Taft 's vigorous can ' paigning with Dewey 's so-called " Me ' tooism , " some GOP strategists have concluded that the formula for victory lies in an uncompromising attack on everything the Administration repre : sents . Taft 's forthright stand on mart issues was unquestionably effective . Some voters described him as " the smartest man in the country . " Other ' praised his " honesty and ability , " eve ! ' while disagreeing with him . But It would be a serious blunder if the Be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vote for moderation , particularly among those middle ' class farm and urban elements who IV . pear to hold the balance of power in the country . On the surface , these groups scent have shifted radically . In my judgment ' the change from 1948 to 1950 is not al great as it seems . In both elections , ' believe , the key to their voting was a desire to hold onto the gains of the Roosevelt-war years . In 1948 , when those gains were menaced by a depre5-sion , these farmers and medium-incon city dwellers saw safety in a " c11 ' something " government . Last NOV'l her , with war and inflation threaten ' ' to devour the gains of the last decade ' the " safe " vote was against " do-too ' much " government . From my talks with these voters wh ? shifted , I would say their desire is t ? halt a drift which threatens to get out of hand , rather than to turn back the clock . Neither party enjoys their 1111 confidence and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a twenty-four-year old Columbiana County farmer put it , " I wish I kilee ' , more about politics . I do n't know WM. : to believe . I think maybe the her course is to see that neither party ge15 too strong . If I saw one party getting too much power , I 'd vote for the other in the next election . " In campaigning for a Congress which would support his Fair Deal , Truman clearly misjudged the temper of the country , which was seeking a balone , wheel to his Administration . Will tPj Republicans misread the meaning ? k their November gains ? In Ohio enough former supporters of Truman are ready for a change to insure a Republica . presidential victory in 1952 ? uttle they are driven back into the Deo ? cratic fold by the Republicans . 4
