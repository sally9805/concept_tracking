Blared a headline in the Los Angeles Mirror : " WOLF BOY " REARED BY ANIMALS BOLTS RAW MEAT , SNARLS , BITES . Said the Indianapolis Star : SNARLING " WOLF BOY " FOUND IN INDIA . All over the U.S. last week , newspapers printed such sensational headlines over wire service stories from New Delhi , describing in wide-eyed fascination the discovery of a " nine-year-old ' wolf boy ' " with clawlike hands and a double set of upper-jaw incisors " who walks on all fours , wolfs down raw meat and laps water like an animal . . . There was some speculation the boy might have been reared by jackals , but the attending doctor said jackals often devour their young , while she-wolves are known to have strong maternal instincts . " In the hospital at Lucknow , India , where the boy was being treated , reported A.P. , the wolf boy " cringes from the light . . . snarls , " and has " tried to bite attendants . " The wire services and the dozens of papers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Baltimore Sun ) left out one detail about the " wolf boy , " which every editor should have known : the story was a complete ( and tragic ) hoax , the same kind of hoax that crops up every year or so. * <P> Ever since Romulus and Remus , folklore full of children reared by wild animals has been passed on and diligently reported . In the manner of Kipling 's fictional " wolf-suckled , snake-taught , elephant-advised " Mowgli , Ireland has produced a sheep boy , Africa a baboon boy who devoured 89 prickly pears in one sitting . Seven years ago , newsmen seriously reported that a gazelle boy , was found running , at 50 m.p.h. , stark naked across the Syrian desert . ( The giveaway clue : he was obviously accustomed to wearing clothes since his arms and face were tanned , but his body was white . ) <P> Last week 's " wolf boy " followed the familiar pattern of his ancestors . A mentally retarded child , who apparently had been partially paralyzed by a birth injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Lucknow . Doctors at the hospital where he was taken discovered he had two sets of upper incisors , hastily jumped to a series of unwarranted , nonmedical conclusions . The English-language Lucknow National Herald ( est. circ. 10,000 ) heard about it , carried the first story reporting that the boy " seems to have been taken away to the jungle by jackals when just a small child . " A Reuters correspondent at New Delhi , 300 miles away , long-distanced the hospital , put the story on its world wire with some added information : " Medical authorities propose taking him to Lucknow zoo to watch his reaction to the presence of female wolves . " A.P . and U.P . filed their own " wolf boy " stories , though no one from the wire services had actually seen the wolf boy . Meanwhile , at the government hospital , the doctor-superintendent ( and source of the stories ) was reveling in the publicity . Amidst a swelling tide of local protest , the sick , deformed child was put in a ward where spectators saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ howl and moan .
