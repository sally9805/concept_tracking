In Malaya last week communist guerrillas still sowed death &; destruction . Forty thousand British troops and a third of the Malaya Federation 's budget were needed to hold down 5,000 jungle-wise Red terrorists . Yet Red destruction was more than matched by anti-Red construction . Rubber , tin and rice production stood at a record peak . More significant , the country 's long antagonistic racial groups , the Malays and the Chinese , were closing ranks toward national unity . <P> Community of Interest . The federation includes almost equal numbers of Malays ( 2,500,000 ) and Chinese ( 2,000,000 ) . The Malays are leisurely , pork-hating Moslems , the country 's old settlers . The Chinese are industrious , pork-loving Confucianists , largely recent immigrants who now dominate the economy . After the war , the Malay nationalists insisted on limiting citizenship rights to some 10% of the Chinese . Such discrimination obviously undermined the country 's chances of withstanding the Communist terror that broke out in June 1948 . <P> Early in 1949 Britain 's able Malcolm MacDonald , Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Communities ' Liaison Council . On the council was the influential head of the United Malay National Organization , spruce , bespectacled , British-educated Dato Onn bin Jafaar , 54 , once a violent baiter of Chinese . Several months of round-table parleys , plus the mounting Communist threat , converted Dato Onn . He publicly proclaimed : " Malays must accept as full nationals those of other races who are prepared to give their all to the country . " <P> Sharing of Power . Urging Malays to support an enlarged franchise for Chinese , Dato Onn told Chinese businessmen : " You must share your economic power if we are willing to share our political power . " He proposed that 50% of the Chinese get suffrage now , the other half in 20 years jvhen they are more thoroughly assimilated . The Chinese agreed to teach the Malays business know-how , through Chinese-financed training programs , Chinese-Malay companies and cooperatives . They rallied to the idea of a " political-economic partnership in which Chinese do not hate Malays and Malays do their share of work . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.M.N.O. He resigned from the organization , stepped up his barnstorming throughout the peninsula . The U.M.N.O. recently convened again , re-elected Dato Onn as head , endorsed his program . Last week legislation was under way in the Federation Legislative Council to widen the Chinese franchise .
