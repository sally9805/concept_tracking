About four centuries after David 's men beat Saul 's at the pool of Gibeon ( " And they caught every one his fellow by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side , so they fell down together " ) , Babylon 's King Nebuchadnezzar rumbled down from the north to pillage. * When he withdrew , after raids in 598 and 587 B.C. , the people of Gibeon must have found their city wrecked and the pool contaminated . Apparently they tumbled in boulders from the town 's wreckage , then filled the well 's broad stone shaft with earth , clay and bits of pottery . <P> <P> The city and the well were lost to history until this summer , when-after two seasons of excavation at a site called El-Jib a few miles north of Jerusalem-the pool of Gibeon began to flow again . Its discoverer : Archaeologist James B. Pritchard , who in 1951 found the palace of Herod at Jericho . <P> Pottery at a Premium . Searching three years ago for Gibeon , Dr. Pritchard surveyed 39 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Hebrew to Arabic , might well be a blurred rendering of Gibeon . Last year Pritchard began to dig ( his expedition was financed by the University of Pennsylvania Museum and the Church Divinity School of the Pacific , where he teaches Biblical Hebrew ) . Four feet below the surface at El-Jib Pritchard found the walls of houses , then evidence of a 26-ft. - thick wall surrounding the town , and finally the rim of a pool 37 ft. across . <P> Concentrating on the pool , Pritchard made such exciting finds of pottery that this year he began to pay premium rates to 100 native diggers , set them to work two shifts a day hauling out debris in baskets made of old auto tires . In short order they had dug past the well 's first stage-a broad shaft cut out of limestone 33 ft. deep , faced with a spiral staircase . Then the diggers excavated a narrower tunnel with steps cut in its side to reach a broad water-drawing room 82 ft. below the surface . <P> Wood , Water &; Wine .

Among the finds : pottery painted in red and yellow with designs of birds , which may force revision of the theory held by many archaeologists that because of Moses ' injunction against idolatry ancient Jews shunned imagery . Also unearthed : pottery wine jars ( the first found in 67 years of Palestine archaeology ) , which offer a clue to Palestine 's early economy and confirm that the men of Gibeon were not only " hewers of wood and drawers of water " but also drinkers of wine . Since the jars bear the names of wine-making firms ( Hananiah , Azariah and Amariah ) , they also offer scholars one of the largest finds of Hebrew writing of an era some 500 years before the Dead Sea Scroll period . <P> <P> *Among other events at Gibeon mentioned in the Bible : the siege by Amorite kings which was lifted by Joshua as the sun stood still and stones rained down on the fleeing besiegers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joab ( II Samuel 20 ) ; Solomon 's dream of wisdom ( I Kings 3:5-15 ) .
