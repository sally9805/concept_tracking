txt A " clerical error " in a Civil Service list stirred up a wake of confusion and bitter disappointment yesterday after the new Fire Commissioner , Jacob Grumet , had made his first promotions . As a result , four firemen among 153 sworn in as lieutenants by the Commissioner had to be replaced by four others who made equal marks in competitive examinations and , in addition , were reportedly senior to them . The near miss was especially chagrining to the four men who thought for a few hours that they had attained commissioned rank because the Civil Service list of eligibles from which they had been chosen expires tomorrow night . After years of service , they will have to compete again for high places on the next list . The four were Joseph Tytell of Hook and Ladder Company 156 , William H. Kalletta of the Second Battalion , Joseph Weinhofer Jr . of Engine Company 272 and Evert Laaksonen of Engine Company 306 . Replacement Not a Demotion Fire officials said their replacement did not amount to a demotion because promotions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The orders , which would have confirmed the commissions , were delayed for the substitution of the four other names . The replacements were Paul P. Maggio of 107 Ridgewood Avenue , Brooklyn , who is on military leave ; Peter F. Jowise of the Seventh Division , who will go to Engine Company 320 ; Francis X. Jondreau of Engine Company 6 , who will go to Engine Company 250 , and Robert J. Stennes of Engine Company 305 , whose new assignment will be Engine Company 54 . The mistake was discovered when a group of seven firemen appeared at department headquarters in the Municipal Building with a contention that they should have been sworn in . It was not clear whether any of the replacements were in this group , but at least one of them was surprised by his good fortune . The new names were chosen after a special meeting of the Municipal Civil Service Commis- sion had approved a corrected certification of the list of eligibles for lieutenant . The list containing the errors had been certified to the department on Wednesday . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had planned family celebrations and at first were unable to believe it . " I ca n't see how they can demote us after we were promoted , " said Fireman Kalletta . " I was sworn in as a lieutenant at the ceremony . There 's no doubt about it . The Commissioner was there and everybody . " Fireman Weinhofer , who also has been thirteen years in that grade and is the father of three children , said the promotion would have meant a $900 increase in his yearly pay of $4,400 . At a fire house where he was on duty he said ruefully that he was " afraid to call my wife and let her know I 'm not in . " Board of Estimate May Act Last night at City Hall it was believed that a special session of the Board of Estimate might be called today if formal action should . be required to untangle the snarl .

Although the men mistakenly sworn in yesterday suffered no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Estimate might provide for additional appointments . This action might be complicated , however , by the fact that a dozen men below the cut-off point on the Civil Service list had the same marks as some of those who were promoted yesterday . The painful denouement came after a noon-hour swearing-in ceremony had apparently gone off without a hitch . Ten higher ranking officers were also sworn by the Thirty-ninth Battalion was raised to deputy chief . Capt . Eugene E. Schoenleber of Engine Company 287 and Capt . William P. Landy of Hook and Ladder Company 52 were named battalion chiefs . Promotions from lieutenant to captain went to John W. Smith of Engine Company 1 , Peter W. Burns of Engine Company 3 , William M. Kelly of Engine Company 156 , John J. Higgins of Engine Company 307 , Edward T. Heeg of Hook and Ladder Company 12 , Thomas Culkeen of Hook and Ladder Company 50 and William Kronenberger Jr . of Hook and Ladder Company 149 . One hundred fifty-three firemen were raised to the rank of lieutenant . Grumet Praises Firemen Saying he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Commissioner Grumet urged the men who were made lieutenants : " Never forget that you once wore a blue shirt  --  the distinguished mark of a fireman . It never hurt anyone to remember that he was once at the bottom of the ladder . " Addressing the entire group he said : " As this is my first public appearance as Fire Commissioner , let me say that I know , and have long known , that a more splendid body of God-fearing men would be hard to find than we have in our department . And I am proud to be its head . The acts of a few misguided men can not injure the glorious reputation this department has enjoyed throughout the years for efficiency , bravery , and honesty . " The " misguided men " to whom the Commissioner referred were apparently those involved in shakedown rackets . Sixteen members or former members of the department 's Division of Combustibles were accused by the Commissioner on Thursday of accepting bribes for approving air compressor installations without properly inspecting them . He linked the alleged racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received heavy sentences last week .
