Theologians , churchmen and their followers are getting set for a high-level hassle in August , when the Second Assembly of the World Council of Churches meets in Evanston , 111 . Main theme of the Assembly : " Christ , the Hope of the World . " European Protestant theologians , it is expected , will insist that the Hope is only in the strictly Biblical Second Coming of Christ and the End of the World , a theory that ecumenical Americans tend to leave to the fundamentalists and Adventist sects . Against this view many U.S. theologians will probably maintain that the Hope is in the gradual and practical Christian betterment of the world . In the current issue of the interdenominational quarterly , Religion in Life , pessimistic Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr asserts that the choice of theme was a bad idea in the first place . <P> It is silly , thinks Niebuhr , to advertise Christianity by insisting on what , to the secular-minded , will seem " fantastic , " i.e. , the Second Coming . " The New Testament eschatology is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the simple-minded modern man , who has become so accustomed to trying to make sense out of life by measuring history in terms of some scheme of rational intelligibility . . . While the present seems a very strategic era in which to restore a part of the New Testament faith which had become discredited and obscured , we need only to analyze the needs of our generation to recognize that it is not particularly redemptive to approach a disillusioned generation with a proud ' I told you so ' and a fanciful picture of the end of history , or at least a picture which will seem fanciful to our generation . . . What would be more to the point is to bear witness to our faith in terms ... of watchfulness and soberness ... of faith and of love-which will appeal to a world in the night of despair as having some gleams of light in it , derived from the ' Light that shineth in darkness .
