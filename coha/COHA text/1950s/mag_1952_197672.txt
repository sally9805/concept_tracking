In Philadelphia last week , famed Violinist Efrem Zimbalist , 63 , came out of a three-year retirement to solo with the Philadelphia Orchestra . His reason : he wanted to play the world premiere of Gian-Carlo ( The Consul ) Menotti 's Violin Concerto in A Minor . <P> It turned out to be a happy decision for everybody . The songful style that marks Menotti 's operas was apparent in the concerto , and its easygoing expression was well suited to Zimbalist 's delicate tone and refined phrasing . For Philadelphians it was pleasant listening ; the audience gave a rousing round of applause to the violinist , the composer and Conductor Eugene Ormandy . <P> The concerto is Menotti 's best instrumental work to date ( though he himself still prefers his 1945 Piano Concerto in F ) . It has humor and a touch of drama , and a striking contrast of light &; dark textures ( major &; minor ) unifies the whole piece . Its weakness is formal : the main line of progress is too full of pleasant but unrelated detours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoys the freedom of writing music without having to think about a libretto . " After I get a couple more operas out of my system I will concentrate on concert music alone , " he says . " But I 'll never write to a deadline again . Trying to finish the concerto in time , I had a sick stomach for days . Zimbalist only had three weeks to memorize his part . He had a sick stomach , too . " <P> For the present , Menotti will be busy directing new performances of his operas : Amahl and the Night Visitors for TV on Christmas Day ( he had to find a new boy soprano , since two earlier ones are teetering on the vocal edge of manhood ) and a concert performance of The Consul in Philadelphia next month . After that he will concentrate on the score and libretto of The Saint of Bleecker Street , which " may take me five years . I do n't care . I have been reading about saints . It is very difficult .
