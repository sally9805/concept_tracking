GREAT BRITAIN The Princess &; the Hero Britons were touched and some were shocked by the news : their favorite princess , Margaret , is in love . <P> This time the news had the ring of authenticity . It was not the story of a glittering princess who had found her Prince Charming in the fairyland of Mayfair , but of a girl whose increasingly sober face in the newspictures seemed to reflect a deeply troubled heart . The fact was that 22-year-old Margaret was in love with a Battle-of-Britain hero of the R.A.F. , a divorced commoner of 38 . Family loyalty , religious responsibility , the duty of royalty-all seemed warring with the romantic impulse in the pretty princess ' heart . <P> Unnoticeable . It was understandable that the gossips had overlooked slim , personable Group Captain Peter Wooldridge Townsend , D.S.O. , D.F.C. , even though his picture had been appearing in the papers alongside Margaret for years . The gossip columnists who had long sought to probe the secrets of the princess ' heart simply forgot the Holmesian precept that the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a royal equerry and deputy master of King George VI 's household ( appointed in 1944 when Margaret was only 14 ) , he had the constant duty of accompanying the royal family in all its lighter moments . Group Captain Townsend rode with the princesses , escorted Margaret to parties , flew her planes in air races , played canasta with the Queen , and by royal command enlivened many a gathering at Sandringham or Balmoral with his quick wit and boyish charm . He was , moreover , a securely married man who lived with his wife and two sons ( the youngest of whom is the late King George 's godson ) in a " by grace and favor " cottage on the grounds of Windsor Castle . If the younger princess found him delightful , so too did her mother and her sister . Elizabeth , Margaret and Philip were frequent and informal guests at the Townsend cottage . Even after Townsend last year brought the breath of scandal close to Windsor by divorcing his wife for adultery , the Queen Mother let it be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household at Clarence House . <P> Early this summer , Princess Margaret told her sister , the Queen , that she wanted to marry the airman . Soon afterward , Elizabeth II began to sound out her ministers on the possibility of amending the Regency Act in such a way as to ease the restrictions on Margaret 's marriage. * Meanwhile , the true state of the young princess ' heart remained a family secret . Last June , when U.S. newsmen descended on London for the coronation , the secret popped out with a bang in the tabloid New York Daily News .
