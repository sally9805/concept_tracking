In a slablike , loudspeaker-shaped building in Manhattan this week the 81-nation conclave , which romantics like to call " the parliament of man , " addressed itself to a historic task . The problem before the U.N . General Assembly-the persistent , nitroglycerin-like instability of the Middle East-was infinitely complex and the potential consequences of another Mideastern explosion were incalculable . Yet , for all that , the great majority of delegates went to the fifth special session in the 13-year history of the Assembly armed with nothing more than what the Japanese engagingly called " a policy of positive wait-and-see . " <P> Virtually every chancellery in the world - including Soviet Russia's-had been thrown off stride by the vagaries of Nikita Khrushchev . Ever since the Iraqi coup , Khrushchev had rendered the nights hideous with his full-throated cries for a summit conference on the Mideast . In his evident eagerness he had even accepted the U.S. and British proposal for a summit meeting held within the framework of the U.N . Security Council .

" Reasons : " The Security Council . . . is practically subordinated to U.S. foreign policy " and , besides , it includes " the representative of a political corpse , Chiang Kai-shek . " Both of these so-called facts existed when Khrushchev originally accepted a Security Council summit . <P> In actuality , the composition of the Security Council had little or nothing to do with Khrushchev 's climb-down ( see below ) . But to lend a note of conviction to his complaints-and to save what diplomatic face he could-Nikita suggested a substitute for a Security Council summit : an extraordinary session of the General Assembly " to discuss the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanon and British troops from Jordan . " <P> Joint Chuckle . Reaction to Khrushchev 's naked renege ranged from sneers to near tears . " On again , off again , Finnigin , " shrugged Secretary of State John Foster Dulles . KHRUSHCHEV MAKES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Responsibility for evading a summit meeting with the Security Council rests squarely with the Soviet Union , " lamented the Times of India .
