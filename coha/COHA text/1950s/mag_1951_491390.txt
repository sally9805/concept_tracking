I. T HERE is n't any trouble ca n't be washed away by the sound of water running through a sluice box . " A stocky sensitive-looking Swede said it , turning his head my way and smiling with the friendliness of a man who is going to be out on the lonely tundra soon , and for a long time . He would not really miss people . Half the men at the bar were prospectors or gold miners , each bound for some particular creek in the Northern Alaska hills . Seeing how fast the liquor was disappearing , one might think that these men already were trying to wash their troubles away . Actually , they had no troubles . It would be difficult to collect , anywhere , twenty or thirty men more completely happy . This was spring , breakup time ; they were in Nome again and their supplies were packed . They had come back from a winter spent in the States , the larger Alaskan cities and the mines in the southern part of the territory , and a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their snowbound cabins near Nome . By some shared intuition they had all arrived at the same conclusion  --  that this year May tenth would he the right time to leave for their diggings . But now the weather was thick , and the bush pilots could not take the men till it cleared . As they sat in the bar and waited , there was not a jangled nerve in the whole company . The bar is the hotel restaurant , too , and the entrance is through the kitchen . It is a large room , square , with the tables around the edge , the horseshoe bar in the center and plenty of space left over . Being lately remodeled , it has glass-brick panels framing a view of the Bering Sea , and three electric fans push the warmth down from the ceiling . Otherwise the room could belong to the last century , to Rex Beach 's stories , it is so obviously an outpost . The north is an indestructible frontier . It will always be isolated and uncomfortable enough so that only the pioneer-spirited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not matter . At Nome , even in 1951 , they can find almost every -- thing the original frontiers had : the freedom , the friendliness , the excitement , the colorful characters and the stories . They will meet the tall men of action and the women with humor and some with a dashing and forthright beauty . Becaum. northerners all need one another , most relationships will seem extraordinarily sympathetic . That morning of May tenth , when the miners were waiting to go to the hills , the weather was stormy and dark , but inside the restaurant bar all the lights were burning . For nobody needed darkness to help him escape from reality into a dream . Reality here is the dream . " Have a drink . . . Well , anyway , have your dinner here at the bar . " Some of the kitchen customers sat at the bar , some of the drinkers were served at the dining tables . Nothing was fixed or rigid .

Almost anybody can " make wages , " as northerners say , out of the Like most small boys with ears , " Jake " Jacobsen in his early years had only a mild appreciation of water . But growing up around Payette , Idaho , he had a chance to see the miracles water can accomplish when wedded with a land that never knew it . And as County Extension Agent working out of Miles City , Montana , back in the devastating thirties , he learned the tragedy of drought . " Those were days a man never forgets  --  and never wants to see again , " Jake says . " They were selling calves for five dollars a head and yearlings for twelve just to keep them from dying of thirst and starvation . Meat counters were overflowing with low-priced meat . But breeding herds were being depleted , and it takes years to rebuild them . " ? It 's no wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are almost a passion now with this soft-spoken man who 's as real as the leather in his boots and as practical as the buttons down the front of his shirt . In his present assignment as County Agent for Big Horn County , Montana , Jake Jacobsen has plenty of opportunity to put his practical ideas on water conservation and other better farm practices to work . It 's Paul Bunyan-size territory he 's serving . It goes as far up in the air as a towering eleven thousand feet and spreads itself out and around three million acres . Yes , a man can really breathe in country like this  --  if he has the time . Jacobsen figures he drives around twenty thousand miles a year to see his families , and that 's not counting the travel on horseback into rough country where even a jeep would say " no . " " It 's not the kind pf country where you can pick up a telephone and advise a man on some problem , " Jake Ja'cobsen says . " Most folks do n't have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailboxes . I just keep on the move . " What he did n't say is , a lot of information moves with him . Agriculture is varied in Big Horn County . There are cattle and more cattle , sheep , diversified farming in the irrigated areas , and dryland wheat farming . A county agent in livestock country has to come up with a lot of different answers in order to help keep your meat coming . And this man has them  --  or he gets them . Technically speaking , both Jacobsen 's office and home are in Hardin , the county seat . But it sounds to us more as if his office were in his head and his home in his boots . NOME , ALASKA ( CAmt ' ed from Page 25 ) ground in summer . Panning or digging for gold is about as common as gardening in warmer climates . Many families in Nome either do it or spend their vacations hunting for places where they can try . They camp up and down the creeks of the Seward Peninsula , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nobody fishes except to stave off hunger . Some families have elaborate outfits . One couple takes a 1926 tractor , a five-horsepower drill on skids , a rubber-tired go-devil and a wanigen , which is any movable shelter . Theirs is a plywood shack with wheels under it . Pulled by the tractor , their train moves over the tundra . No roads lead far back in the hills , though a narrow-gauge railway , twisted and heaved by the frost , gives a reeling ride for about eighty miles . One can go on the Demon , a jeep-sized locomotive , or put flanged wheels on one 's own car and drive on the tracks . By bush plane and foot power , also , the Nome citizens scatter hack on the slopes , which are mottled in summer with the bright colors of tundra flowers and with lines of willow brush marking the natural furrows caused by the permafrost " creep , " the sloughing of soil into folds as it freezes and thaws . The slopes have a dry , sweet smell , and birds fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salad of sour dock said that the snow bunting was asking , " Are you in a green , green tree ? " The answer would have to be no , for the tundra vegetation is less than waist-high . But the treeless hills have a simplicity which seems restful and lovely to northerners , and the low-slanting Arctic sun washes them all day long with a clear , delicate light like the freshness of early morning . Or for that matter , one can mine on the beach at Nome . This year it was richer than usual . Two girls panned ninety-two dollars yesterday at the end of Front Street . The men laughed at them , bringing their glittering sand to the bank in a washtub . Mining furnishes much of the income as well as the recreation for the people of Nome . Platinum , tin and other minerals , besides gold , are found on the Seward Peninsula , in mines worked by individuals , partners or companies that employ up to fifty and , in one case , 400 men . The United States Smelting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ringing Nome with their tailings . Nome has the temporary look of mining towns everywhere ? the get-itand-get-out trashiness of a community where people are hoping to make a strike and take the money " back home . " The town does not appear to be home to most of the white settlers . But the rubbish and flimsiness are due as much to Nome 's far-north location as to any preoccupation with luck in seeking gold . Nome is a mining town ; it is a frontier , which is a harder destiny , and it is a frontier close to the Arctic Circle . Nowhere else on earth would mere giddiness prove so quickly inadequate . Nome has many sound assets that can not be weighed on scales and shipped to the United States Mint . They are related to  --  in fact , inseparable from  --  the town 's situation between the tundra and ice pack . Before a visitor ever reaches Nome , he has begun to understand it ; its remoteness and inaccessibility have become real . The three or four freighters that sail there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nome has to fly . My plane left Anchorage at 8:30 A.M. It climbed fast . Within half an hour we were up 14,000 feet , above pinnacles that seemed to be made of gun metal . Snow was cradled far down in the valleys , but most of the upper slopes were uncovered , appearing too polished and hard to hold anything , even lichens . This Alaska Range is not wide . The mountains soon dropped away , - and the plane came down to a lower level . The Eskimos have a word , shaktolik , literally meaning " stretched out , " which is used for the feeling you have when you have been traveling toward a place for so long that it seems you will never reach it , that you will keep going forever . Shaktolik describes the experience of flying to Nome . For the first few hours we were above the muskeg , olive-green in summer and seeming dark , for its plants have no shine . Most of them grow out of frozen ground  --  the permafrost , as it is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees finally all disappeared , and then we were over the tundra , frozen to bedrock and into the rock itself , many hundreds of feet under the spongy surface . We were approaching slopes . There can be no highways across this land , for the material of a roadbed attracts the heat ( Continued on Page 46 ) THE SATURDAY EVENING POST .11firillary 27 , 1951 ? ( Coot ' ed fnati Page 4.4. ) of the summer sun , melting the permafrost and allowing the road to drop . The coast line along the outer boundary of the tundra is approximately the same strip of shore that is blocked from the shipping lanes for eight or nine months by ice . These natural barriers of frozen earth and frozen sea leave no possibility that the region ever will have easy contact with the cities down in the States . Since Nome is up on that coast , its frontier status is guaranteed for all predictable time . During the last 100 miles , we flew in the final time zone before tomorrow , farther west than Hawaii and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the windows . Finally , descending through thinner and thinner clouds , the plane was low enough so that a shoreline appeared below . At a headland with waves curling white at its base , we turned north , as the coast did , and there , on a smooth swing of the shore , was a cluster of houses , white men 's houses . They bordered a mile of the water front and spread back for three or four blocks , seeming unreal , like a town built of toys , for there were no factories and , aside from the mining dredges , few structures related to commerce . No farmlands surround the town , and no highways or railroads fan out to connect with the rest of the world . Nome looks like a town as a child might plan it  --  unpretentious homes , stores , a school and a hospital . On one side was a narrow airstrip with small planes parked beside it . On the , other side was the big cross of the field maintained by the Air Force . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel . Beside a door opening off the lobby into the owner 's apartment was a bell . I rang it . Nothing happened . The taxi driver sat down in one of the chrome-andleatherette chairs . Several other men were there , none reading , none smoking , none restless . I felt the gaze of their courteous eyes . They were real Alaskans , who spend so much of their time waiting ? on weather , on planes , on the mail that arrives by the planes , on the . whole unhurried process of northern living , geared scarcely at all to clocks  --  that they turn waiting into a pastime ? that of receptively watching . It calls for a kind of patience that can not be learned in a minute , not perfectly in a year , and so I continued to stand by the door and press the bell intermittently . The owner finally appeared , looking somewhat displeased . I said , " My travel agent wrote to you twice and wired once , but he did n't have any answer . I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ca n't pay any attention to reservations , " the woman said passively . " And we 're full up today . " After a moment of thought , she telephoned someone , and then told me , " They 'll give you a room over one of the bars . " While we were on our way down the street , the taxi driver said , " There used to be a hotel right about here , but a storm carried it out . " " You mean carried the whole hotel out to sea ? " " That 's right . A couple of men were asleep in one of the rooms . They went out with it and were lost . " Others later confirmed the story . In the States , my room might have rented for two dollars a day ; in Nome it cost four . It had no bath , of course . A door on the hall was marked SHOWER , but it opened onto a stack of mattresses . My one window looked out on the ocean , on the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jetties through which the Snake River spills out to sea . No ships were in sight and no small boats were at anchor or pulled up on the beach , and the emptiness of the scene increased the impression of Nome 's remoteness , as the lack of highways and railroads on the land side had done . The ocean was slate-blue , a heavy color surely determined by something besides the misty sky . On the horizon was a bank of pewtergray clouds . So that was the Bering Sea , famous and fearful , where storms begin ... and beyond wits Siberia . But I wanted to see the city , so fabled , and went downstairs and outside . Front Street is wide , and glistened that day with almost impassable mud . Most of the buildings that line it are single-storied . At the height of the gold rush , 20,000 people lived in Nome , many in tents . They moved into houses later , but in 1934 the town was destroyed by fire . The population by then was declining ; now it is less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its spectacular past , however , Nome was expected to have a great future , and so Front Street was made wide enough after the fire to take care of the traffic . Few cars were parked on the day 1 arrived ; infrequently one would go splashing past , and the width of the street lent an air of unrealized hope to the scene . A limitless , high , white sky spread over the mud , the boardwalks , the weathered front of the little drugstore , an ice-cream parlor called The Glue Pot , the Dream Theater with its posters half-obscured by the dust on the windows , and the bars , most of which are just bars , not in any sense lounges . An Army bus let out some soldiers who trailed into the North Pole Bakery . By now , two years after my first visit , Front Street seems to me one of the world 's most glamorous thoroughfares . It stands for pioneer courage , and what gives it character is not any collection of chrome and tile , but the life that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outside those falsefronted stores . I can remember that Nome looked insubstantial and shabby the day I arrived , but even then there was a difference about this grayness  --  a shimmer , something gauzy and light in the clouded air . The people seemed buoyant and happy , as if Nome was the place they most wanted to be . That impression took strength from the Eskimos ' smiles , so quick , so sincere and so reassuring . " Childlike , " Eskimos often are called . It is true that their smiles are spontaneous  --  Eskimos smile from the heart , and if that is naive , they are childlike . But now , after close companionship with them , I believe that their friendliness is a combination of courtesy and compassion . The security that most white people know is outside their experience , and they think of us all as living precariously . Therefore they approach even a stranger with gentleness and , in their smiles , with encouragement . Some of the Eskimo girls and young men on Front Street were dressed like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well-known cotton smocklike garments , ending in ruffles , that cover fur parkas . They seem to be putting their dresses on over their coats , but the explanation is that the parka is worn fur side in , and the cotton cover is needed to keep snow off the hide , because dampness would rot it . The women 's covers are made of brightly printed percale . The men 's , which are shorter , are white duck , a camouflage when the hunters stalk seals on the ice . The men 's have real basic style . Most white settlers prefer " outside parkas , " worn with the fur away from one 's skin . They are not so warm , and one envies the Eskimos when the temperature is thirty or forty degrees below zero7 But the homes of this little city ? what were they like ? I turned back from Front Street , and my attention was captured first by a man who passed in a cart with a framework surrounding it , under which ten or twelve dogs were harnessed . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played in a dooryard , their way with each other as softly grave as if they had been reared on Victorian poetry . A young man went by , riding a bicycle backward . He sat on the handle bars , with his hands in his , pockets , never looking over his shoulder to see what he headed into . Anyway , there was no traffic , except the dogs . I wound through a pack of seventeen , and dogs ? big Malemutes and a few recklessly flippant cockers  --  were everywhere . One dog was " singing . " That talent , common to northern Huskies , is said to be inherited from wolf ancestors . The dog was up on a packing box , nose toward the sky . He hit a high note , let it slide down and up , played with it , held it for what one would think several breaths and ended it with a long , smooth , descending slide and a twirl for a finish . Then he lowered his head and looked around with what seemed a bid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was . A white mother was pushing a child in a basket sled rigged with wheels . The whole scene had a slightly delirious air , which I know now to be typical of the town . It is well borne out by the architecture . The Nome houses are small , and many are tipped so crazily by the frost in the soil that they could be illustrations for the story of the gingerbread man . Probably half are only a single room , made of the lightest materials . Tar-paper shacks stand among cabins covered with imitation-brick facing or corrugated iron . There are frame cottages , and houses of a diminutive formality , with tiny turrets , cupolas and scrollwork around the porches , suggesting that their owners had memories of stately homes and had tried to reproduce a few details in miniature . But the flimsiness is not dismal . Many buildings in Nome are brightly colored , and greenhouses and glassed porches make vivid splashes in every block . There is only one lawn in Nome , owned by the president of the powerand-light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or beach gravel , so that the top of the soil will not melt and form ponds . But the window gardens make Nome appear gay , with that infallible charm ? lightheartedness in the face of hardships . The first limitation is the distance that building materials come . Besides the cost of the haul from the States , supplies must be lightered in two miles from the ships at rates that for some goods equal the rates from Seattle . The lighterage is made necessary by the shallowness of the sea off Nome and by the fact that there can not be piers anywhere in the Far North because ice takes them out . The cost results from the short time each year  --  three or four months  --  that the lighterage equipment is utilized . The freight rates on oil also keep the houses small . Most people in Nome burn oil , and at the price paid for it , they can not afford to heat the air up under high ceilings or in unused nooks , and for one person to occupy all of a warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two or three places along the Arctic coast , but there is no means of transporting it far . Living in Nome is held to an unassuming scale for the further reason that the town stands on permafrost . When the warmth from a stove has melted the ground underneath , a structure will sag at that point . The Federal building as well as the cottage next to it tilts . Some of the Nome houses rest on big timbers , like sleds , and are moved when the ground has become uneven , and some are propped in the air on quadrangles of beams , jacked up periodically . Many are simply askew . Cracks in walls are inevitable , and windows and doors incessantly jam as their frames are twisted . Not all the complications of living on ice appear until one has tried it . Nome 's water supply comes from the hills behind town . In summer it flows through pipes laid on top of the ground , necessarily , since the water wbuld freeze if the pipes were buried . In walking around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rest of the year the water is brought in by ( Continued on Page 48 ) 48 TILE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 27 , 1951 ( Continued front Page 46 ) truck and is sold by the bucket . Water from household drains stands in the dooryards until it evaporates , being unable to sink into permafrost . Other waste is hauled out on the shelf ice in winter , to be removed at no cost when the ice floats away in June . For people in such an environment no really high standard of living is possible at any price . Very welcome are products like guns and outboard motors , which contribute to local needs , but many of the standard American luxuries are not suitable and others are not substantial enough . The two comforts most often imported are mattresses and stoves . But Alaskans lying on cotton mattresses have frozen to death with blankets over them , and inner-spring mattresses admit even more of the cold ? it flows right up through the little coils . As for stoves , it is hard now to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aggravation in Northern Alaska . I used one and was always trying to decide whether I wanted a baked potato badly enough to chill the room , for in Nome , of course , the oven door of an insulated stove ordinarily would stand open , since the stove was designed to hold in all of its heat . It was a nearly new range , of green enamel , with a firebox for wood or coal . The handle of the oven door and one hinge already had broken off when I rented it , and after two months the firebox lining softened and fell to pieces . The stove was manufactured in Texas , where the failure of a stove would not threaten one 's life , but to pay the freight on a stove from Texas to Nome and then have it collapse when the temperature is forty-five degrees below zero fills one with more than impatience . In a circle around my stove every night I would place all the American products that never were meant to freeze  --  the ink , hand lotion , liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not keep more than a case or two , for I would lose them if the indoor temperature should drop below that haunting thirty-three degrees . More than the recognized perishables disintegrate in the Arctic cold . Some kinds of glue go to pieces ; therefore the plywood may buckle and the veneer may peel off the imported furniture . And there is no cabinetmaker up here to repair it . The maintenance of civilized products in Northwestern Alaska is a problem that shows the American way of life to be a very closely meshed , unified system . Who will find the obscure source of the smoke in a mechanical refrigerator at Nome or in any other remote outpost to which refrigerators are exported ? Occasionally , mechanic specialists come to Nome , but they seem never to stay very long . Perhaps they are not the type to be patient when the repair parts they need must be flown from Seattle . Yet so many mechanical things break down in the North that it seems as if they are bedeviled up here . Electrical appliances , radios , boilers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wo n't work is exasperating at first , and then laughable , except in the case of a stove . The hotel imported the largest and brightest juke box in Nome , and almost at once the box refused to play for a nickel or a dime . For a quarter it played from one to four records . An airplane mechanic tinkered with it , also a boy from the Army base , but they could not make it play for five cents . Sometimes it would not play at all , and the owner threatened to pitch it out on the beach . She was serious . Till the new sea wall was built on top of the junk , the Nome water front was a mile-long collection of high-priced machinery , much of which became worthless because it needed repairs and no one was:here to make them . Nearly buried in sand was the old mining gear of the boom days that gave birth to Nome . Since that time , many costly items came north out of civilization , but an extravagant number lay on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that so few of the northerners care . American businessmen who are planning foreign expansion might consider that curious indifference . There really are people who do not think it a hardship to bathe in a washtub . They will have their individual fondness for this or that aspect of civilized living : a few good pianos are found at Nome , and some beautiful linens and silverware . But most of the Nome interiors are put together with makeshifts for which the Nome householder feels no humiliation . Indeed , what he can do With some sheet metal , plywood and paint toward approximating a tile bathroom fills the newcomer with awe , but is taken as a matter of course by the man himself . Actually it . is not so much that luxuries are lacking in Nome as that there is no emphasis on them . Things are less stimulating to pioneers than happenings are . The American way is soundly entrenched in the north , but it is the American way of a century ago , when freedom meant freedom to do any harmless thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although Nome is a beachhead of civilization , it is not a frontier in the sense that a typicid frontier is ; its pioneers are not clearing land or building up herds of cattle . Permafrost will not support crops , and the few reindeer that graze over the lichens and mosses will probably not increase , for the Eskimos have a natural objection to patrolling the wandering animals during blizzards . The northern country is not likely ever to he domesticated , yet it supports a small population of hunters , trappers , fishermen and miners , and Nome 's frontier activities consist of keeping them in touch with a meager supply of civilized goods and services . The merchandise for almost all of the Seward Peninsula comes by boat in summer and air freight all year , to Nome , from which it is sent to the outlying villages by bush plane . The traffic is greater than might be imagined . It includes delivering mail and furnishing various services like shoe repairing , dry cleaning and developing of films . The villagers come to Nome for medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelers from outside circulate through the north with the hub of their flights at Nome . The incoming orders tell what is happening in the settlements  --  a cons tinuous tale of emergencies . " By next plane , elastic bandage for ankle . " .. . " Box yeast , soon . Dog got into box I had , now I ' can not make bread . " . . . " Three pieces of stovepipe , and please hurry . Ours burned out . " ... " Do you have any new hair ribbons ? If you would send three yards , different colors . We are having Halloween party . " Such messages are not really orders , of course . They are treated in Nome like the calls for help that they are , and they are filled conscientiously and with an understanding of the conditions . In the area tributary to Nome , fewer than 5000 people are living . One would think they might tend to be a forgotten fringe of Uncle Sam 's family , but except for the attitude of the military , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinating Small crowd , for they are studied and regulated and supervised by an unbelievable stream of law-enforcement officers , game wardens , directors of schools , public-health administrators , missionaries , tax collectors , investigators and scientists of many kinds , not to speak of the scores of specialists who are coming each summer , now , to photograph , survey and analyze the land itself and the northern sea . These travelers are very interesting and help to keep the settlers from becoming provincial . Some of the visitors are thrilled by the bush planes on which they go out beyond Nome ; others fear them . One supervisor of schools declares , " Each flight I die . " But theirs are the routine runs , made only in reasonably good weather . The pilots fly frequently during storms to bring in sick , lost , frozen or injured people , and the pilots ' adventures supply much of the lively conversation . Talk is one of the chief forms of recreation . The constructed dramas of moving pictures and radio can not compete with the real events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " When he came to , he was taking the teeth out of his shattered jaw , one by one .

Later he found a piece of his jawbone in his pocket , but he does n't remember putting it there . " The pilot who spoke was telling about Frank Williams , an airplane mechanic who crashed last winter when he was flying his own plane and ran into a snow blow . " He had a bottle of Scotch along . Miraculously it was n't broken , and he decided to have a drink . He did n't taste anything , and he thought that was funny .

Last month an empty skin boat was sighted among the ice cakes that sail northward along the shore at Nome every spring , like a fleet of abandoned white ships . The small hull was just visible off among them , but field glasses showed it to be unoccupied . A message to Fairbanks brought a search plane which hunted over the ice until it had located two Eskimo hunters , marooned on the floe from which their umiak had broken away . The plane dropped a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the sea was too rough . Floyd Wheeler , an employee of the Civil Aeronautics Administration at Nome , owned an aluminum boat . It was no more his responsibility to save the Eskimos than anyone else's- which is to say it was everyone 's . In an hour he had reached the men , but the sea was running so high , with the ice cakes churning and smashing about in an off shore gale , that it took five hours of utmost daring and skill to make the return trip with the hunters . In March of a recent year the wide shelf of ice which had been attached to the beach all winter broke away on a flood tide and started to float out to sea . The day being Sunday , many Nome families were out on that ice , dog-sledding , ski-sailing and fishing through holes . All the small boats but one had been put up for the winter . Its owner ferried the fishermen back to shore over the swiftly widening lead . The dog sled was laid crosswise on the gunwales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ski plane came in , the pilot helped with the rescues . He picked up one man from the far edge of the ice who did not even know that he was adrift . It might seem that the austere country , immense and impersonal , often unsafe , would arouse a certain amount of foreboding and therefore tension . The north draws some neurotics , escaping from civilization 's high pressures , but those people aside , Alaskans are extraordinarily relaxed . The closely knit family life typical of Nome must provide many moments savored by parents . During at least half the year the weather is too cold for young people to prowl around outdoors , either on foot or in cars . No commercial radio programs reach Nome , and of course no television , and yet the youngsters find ways to be happy within the family circle . Some have hobbies , some even play pinochle with their parents . Recreation for adults includes periodical whist parties in the Pioneer Hall , open to anyone for a dollar and enjoyed by the best people . An occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in homes occupy other evenings . ' These would seem to be mild excitement , but in a land so isolated all companionship is rewarding .

Many single men find their sociability there . The bars have a **25;3885;TOOLONG atmosphere , and ( ( ' , ont ' eft on Page 57 ) ( Continued front Pape 52 ) liquor is so much a problem that some of the best workmen are not available half the time . Gambling is not legal , but card games go on around the clock . Such contrast is the rule at Nome , where the unexpected is as familiar now as it was during the gold rush .

In the months just following the start of the war , the Air Force was carrying out a decision made earlier to " de-emphasize " Nome . This was accomplished by removing moat of the military personnel and equipment . Some of the Nome citizens were considerably aroused , but others adopted their usual fatalistic attitude , hard to explain to stateside relatives . Where else will the matron of the jail take the inmates her old New Yorkers . . . and a giant road grader push a stalled car to the home of its owner ... and a girl of the line be one of the town 's best skiers ? Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale than a waitress , since no one can eat a book ... and a breathless naturalist find golden plovers nesting beside a night club . . . and almost no one conceal his past , although some of the pasts are spectacular ? It is not all happy . Where else will one see a thirteen-year-old streetwalker accompanied by her nine-year-old cousin ? We passed her one Saturday afternoon  --  a little Eskimo wearing a skimpy cotton-print dress and a short red jacket . A flowered-silk scarf was slipping down over her frizzily curled hair . In a few years she would imitate the smooth-looking white girls with more success ; now she was a blurred adolescent . She did not want money , she wanted a white friend  --  a husband if dreams came true , or at least a pale , blue-eyed baby . Eskimo girls try to get themselves blue-eyed babies almost as innocently as a year or two earlier they had tried to get themselves dolls . They begin by touching the arm of a white man on Front Street . The one I saw stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seemed puzzled . The child introduced her cousin , the nine-year-old boy . The man talked to them for a moment , no doubt wondering at the desperate hope in the girl 's shy smile . The three stood in front of the bank . The tall blond traveler shifted his packages ; if he had been wearing a hat , I think that he would have tipped it . Instead , he raised his hand , waving good-by . When he had gone , the girl wept , and the cousin , probably without knowing why , joined her . The two children clung to each other , both crying . To this situation the very good school , where white and Eskimo children are at last being educated together , may furnish the answer . It seems to a newcomer that the problem might partly be solved if the white women would give the Eskimo mothers and girls a more charitable guidance . The race prejudice found at Nome is strange to come upon in the tolerant north and is a disappointment . There is almost no lawlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom and integrity are combined in a way supposed to be typical of the " good old days . " Certainly the freedom . Three union organizers journeyed to Nome last month . They called the workers together , threw their buttons and application blanks on the table and started to talk about organizing the town . The workers walked out on them . They do not want to be hampered by rules , the men said . Many have two or three trades and like to change from one to another in the middle of the day if the idea strikes them ; they prefer not to be held down to union working conditions , however favorable . The north is a land of great dreams and , it might be confessed , of some laziness. 4 small boy in one of the Sunday schools pretty well expressed the prevalent attitude . His teacher said , " God is wonderful to us ; he makes the rain and the sunshine . Who of us can make sunshine ? " A four-year-old answered , " I can , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern civilized living simply are lifted away in this community of no pressuring by employers , of no rush , no noise and slight public frowning . Irregularities of a serious kind are not condoned , but eventually are forgotten . The minor ones , the mere unconventionalities , are the very texture of northern life . Obviously the country is not for everyone . Salesmen come  --  expensive salesmen , to be sent so far  --  and while they wait for the plane that will take them away , they sit in the small hotel lobby , with their tailored gabardine topcoats and their excellent haircuts , and occasionally one will speak his thoughts : " Hell , if this is n't the end of the world ! " Yet those who stay , feel for this heady , challenging land the same , almost obsessive enthusiasm found in Southern California . In both cases the land is more than geography . Nome , like Santa Barbara , furnishes a release to some temperaments , so that life seems fuller and richer than elsewhere .
