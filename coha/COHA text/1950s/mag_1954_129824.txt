BERKELEY , CALIF. // Few major athletic events are so apt to satisfy contestants and partisans as totally as Oklahoma 's victory over the University of California last Saturday . The Oklahoma players were delighted with a score  --  27-13  --  that seemed to justify their preseason rating as the first or second best college team in the country . Some 6,000 Oklahoma fans , who occupied enough of California 's 81,000-seat Memorial Stadium to suggest that John Steinbeck 's Okies of the 1930s have graduated to better days , enjoyed their chauvinistic moment among their new neighbors . The California team and coaches were pleased not to have suffered more severely at the hands of a better team , and their supporters accepted this point of view without protest . // California , following a mediocre 1953 record , was an experiment being built around two thoroughly tested items  --  Quarterback Paul Larson and Center Matt Hazeltine , a couple of candidates for All-American consideration this year . Oklahoma aimed to prove their machine as good as last year 's . California hoped their 1954 experiment would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the game began to take shape toward the end of the first quarter and the beginning of the second , it was not the unknown ingredients in the Cal experiment that went wrong . All of a sudden Quarterback Larson , the unpredictable gambler , began to throw craps instead of naturals . When a fine punt by Oklahoma 's Buddy Leake set California back on its own 10-yard line , Larson tried to gamble his team out of trouble . Calling passes but figuring to run his way out of trouble in an emergency , Larson discovered he could n't bamboozle a wise Oklahoma line that was charging him much too hard . In jig time Larson was flat on his back on his own three-yard line . Fullback Tom Kramer kicked out weakly to his own 33 , and five plays later Oklahoma was in command by seven points . // Bud Wilkinson , Oklahoma 's tall , young ( 38 ) , silver-haired coach , allowed later that the turning point of the game was a California fumble in the middle of the third quarter while Oklahoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Cal had n't made mistakes I imagine we would n't have won , " Wilkinson was generous enough to say . // But it was Oklahoma 's opportunism and skill that made the fumble pay off . Putting the ball in play from their own 13 , they executed a perfect example of the split T 's most fearsome weapon  --  the optional lateral-forward pass . Quarterback Gene Calame drifted to the right , threatened the California end , then lateraled to Halfback Buddy Leake , who was cruising outward on the five-yard line . Leake threw a long forward to End Max Boydston , who was in high gear on his own 40 . Boydston easily outran his pursuit for a touchdown play that covered 87 yards , jumped the Oklahoma lead to 14-6 and ended any serious or hopeful doubts about the outcome . // On the whole , the California attitude was well summed up by Captain Hazeltine at a booster rally after the game : " Playing teams like Oklahoma is good experience . I think we 've got a real good ball club . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train tickets to the Rose Bowl . " // CALAME 'S OPTION // OKLAHOMA USES the split T , a system of attack precisely as effective as the quarterback who runs it . In Gene Calame , Oklahoma has perhaps the most skillful split T operator in college ball today , a deft ball handler who is especially adroit handling the key " optional play " in which , scooting laterally behind his line , the quarterback must decide in a split second , as the play develops , whether to keep the ball himself or lateral it wide to a flanking back . Here , in the second quarter of California game , with ball on California 7-yard line , 1 Calame ( No. 31 ) sidles out towards his own left end . 2 He elects to cut inside California 's right end , Jim Carmichael ( No. 89 ) , who has floated out well with play to guard against possible lateral from Calame to his halfback , Bob Herndon ( No. 36 ) , shown trailing the blocker , Bob Burris ( No. 40 ) . 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal line , goes over and then fumbles ( irrelevantly , since the whistle had blown ) after scoring the first of Oklahoma 's four Calame-directed touchdowns . After the game , 5 Gene was hoisted high on the shoulders of his appreciative teammates.
