txt Letters MARA C. UNTERMANCHARLES JAMES.IRENE TILENIUS.HERBERT J. KORBEL. ilme ; 1ers REUNION To THE EDITOR : I can assure you that no one read Murray Schumach 's fine article on " Bubbled , " Central Park zoo 's sea lion ( " ' Bubbles ' : Actress , Athlete , Chanteuse " ; April 1 ) with more amusement and glowing pride than myself , although I am ' 3,000 miles away in Portland , Ore . It was I who gave her her name in a contest for naming the zoo 's newest animal babies , ten years ago when I was 10 , for which I received a bright gold medal . My pride and joy in discovering that she is , according to Mr. Schumach , a full-blown personality ; versatile , variously talented and famous to boot , is positively motherly ! MARA C. UNTERMAN Reed College . Portland , Ore . STYLE CONTROVERSY TO THE EDITOR : Taking in good spirit the quote from Mainbocher in Gilbert Millstein 's article , " Mainbocher Stands for a Fitting " ( March 25 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut , " and therefore could not be expected to understand simplicity , I would like to point out the following : in 1933 I worked for one whole year to construct a dress which had only one spiral seam , which dress became the theme signature of my name , and as such famous . - The word " cut " does not indicate elaboration or excess of seams but simply the construction of a garment . Fashion has at one time or another commanded the suppression of curves or their expression . During the years when Mr. Bocher was Paris editor of " Bubbles*. ? A zoo personality . Vogue , covering the inspiration of others , I , in common with many , was vastly preoccupied with the willowy , boyish ideal of that period .. The willowy , boyish ladies , grown with time squarer and less willowy , do not strike their sons in quite the same light as they did their husbands a generation ago , and we foresaw this in our search for new ideals and new techniques . From the elimination of all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many seamed , boned bodices which produced a molded and swan-like silhouette which was never identified at all with Mr. Bocher , but has now become accepted public fashion . Exploration of magazine and newspaper fashion morgues will show that much that was attributed to Mr. Bocher was long ago identified with others , like myself , who were then straggling against the tide , while he went with it . What was in our youth a garment of suggestive shapelessness expressed in a few panels of crepe de chine became the uniform of middle aged respectability , often worn later by those who were neither respectable nor fashionable at the time . YoUr article failed to mention in conclusion the most important fact of all . All cus ( // mexierai // tom operations of any importance make a terrifying operating loss . It seems a pity that , when such a loss is underwritten , it can not be put to general good and guide a whole industry rather than to stake a claim for the personal creative leadership of someone whose life has been devoted to Memory Lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE EDITOR : I was especially interested in William Benton 's article on education in Russia , entitled " Now the ' Cold War ' of the Classrooms " ( April 1 ) . The figure quoted by Mr. Benton on the number of Russians in institutions of higher learning was 4,300,000 . From another source I have heard this figure is 1,385,000 . Perhaps the sizable discrepancy may be traced to a somewhat different definition of " institutions of higher learning . " I would appreciate clarification of this point . IRENE TILENIUS . Malverne , N. Y. Mr. Benton was including in his total of students " above the secondary level " all highlevel extension-correspondence students , as well as those in vocational colleges . Just what constitutes an institution of higher learning in Russia is open to various interpretations . In Russia 's 800 universities and specialized institutes giving four-year courses there are 1,825,000 students , according to Mr. Benton. ? Editor . SCHOLASTIC RATIOS TO THE EDITOR : Mr. Benton re-emphasizesmost decisively the necessity of adjusting our educational concepts and revising our school system . in view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out quite clearly the major deficiencies hampering our academic set-up . On only one point do I feel disagreement to be warranted . According to Mr. Benton , one problem we must solve is the high pupil-teacher ratio . Hirai solution seems to be the introduction of technology . Visual aids on a limited scale are invaluable , but should not be considered as panaceas that would allow two- and threehundred-pupil classes . One important thing to be learned from the Soviets ( and the British for that matter ) is the importance of preserving quality through selectiveness , surely a healthier principle for preserving a workable teacher-learner proportion . HEIII3ERT J. KOBBEL . Fort Bragg , N. C. Mr. Benton listed four ways in which the United States can meet the Soviet challenge of improved education : ( 1 ) a generous program of scholarships and fellowships ; ( 2 ) the finest teachers ' , corps in the world ; ( 3 ) improved physical plants ; ( 4 ) re-examination of teaching methods  --  Editor . RICHMOND REPLY On March 11 this department of The New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Va. , commenting on an article about race relations in Tuscaloosa , Ala. , published on Feb. 26 . The letter made these points : ( 1 ) " I live in the South ' at peace ' with my neighbors , but I had better not write a letter to the local newspaper or the strings behind the scenes will begin . to move if the thought expressed is not sufficiently humble . " ( 2 ) " I can vote ' freely ' if I stand politely , hat in hand , until the last late white man has paid his poll taxes . " ( 3 ) " I can register to vote if I can get any political official to state the dividing lines of the precinct . " ( 4 ) " If the white registrar is not going fishing or shopping and I have persisted politely for days , maybe I can register . " ( 5 ) " If the officials at the voting booth , all white , are in a good mood , maybe I can vote if I enter respectfully enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial commenting on this letter , in which these points were made : ( 1 ) " In so far as this newspaper is concerned , we publish many letters from Negroes that are about as far from humble as could be imagined . If any ' strings ' behind the scenes have ' moved , ' we never heard of it . " ( 2 ) " White and colored are served at the tax windows in the City Hall on a first come , first served basis . " ( 3 ) " There is no problem about finding out what the dividing lines of a Richmond precinct are . This is the first time we ever heard of such a problem here . " ( 4 ) " The registrar 's office in City Hall is open from Monday through Friday from 8:30 to 5 o'clock , and anybody who is qualified can register , if he goes there . " ( 5 ) ( Answering the letter 's point 5 . ) " Since Negroes by the thousands have been voting in Richmond for many years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foregoing that a Negro Councilman was elected in Richmond a few years ago , with the aid of many white voters ? ? * . " Investigation by the Southern Regional Correspondent of The New York Times bears out the statements of The Richmond Times-Dispatch on these points as far as Richmond itself is concerned . The correspondent adds , however , that " the writer may have been trying to convey a mood of the South in general , as he perceives it . "
