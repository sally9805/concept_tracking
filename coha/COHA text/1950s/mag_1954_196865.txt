" I do n't know how we got here , " said Bradley Basketball Coach Forddy Anderson , in Kansas City for the final of the National Collegiate championship last week . Not even the tournament directors were quite sure how Bradley had reached the final . During the regular season , the Bradley team had a mediocre record of 15 victories , twelve defeats . The " Pride of Peoria " had been a last-minute choice to round out the tournament field of 24 teams , had marched ahead in a succession of upsets . The Eastern finalist in the tournament of upsets was considerably more imposing : Philadelphia 's La Salle College , sparked by All-America Tom Gola , and possessor of a regular season record of 21 victories , four defeats . <P> At halftime , Bradley 's big Braves held a 43-42 lead , seemed on the trail of another upset . But during a dressing-room dressing-down , La Salle Coach Ken Loeffler gave Gola &; Co. new tactics : switch from man-to-man defense to a zone defense . The switch worked wonders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly could not find the range . Meanwhile , Gola &; Co. went on a scoring spree-30 points in ten minutes-and won by an easy 92-76 . <P> For Bradley , disappointment was no stranger . The Braves reached the final of both the National Collegiate and National Invitation tournaments in 1950 , only to lose in both to C.C.N.Y. 's " Cinderella Team . " Later , as it turned out , both teams were dishonored by the fix scandals . Last season , after a Bradley Boosters Club had been too free with its money favors to Bradley players , the Braves were suspended from tournament play by the N.C.A.A. La Salle , on the other hand , won college basketball 's top trophy the very first time it had ever qualified for the tournament . <P> <P> In the national A.A.U. basketball final , another Peoria team had better luck . The Peoria Caterpillars won their third straight title , beating San Diego 63-55.
