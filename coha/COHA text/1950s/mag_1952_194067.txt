When he was 26 , Jack Westland was runner-up at Chicago in the National Amateur Golf tournament . He lost to Francis Ouimet , 38 , one of the oldest men ever to win the title . After that , Jack Westland settled down in Everett , Wash . as a commendable tournament golfer and successful insurance salesman . <P> This year 's National Amateur was to be held at the Seattle Country Club , almost in his own backyard ; Westland , now a grey-templed 47 , decided to take his eighth crack at it . He had also decided on a crack at politics as a Republican candidate for Congress from Washington 's Second District . Instead of practicing putts , he had been out buttonholing supporters and cruising around Everett in a car covered with signs proclaiming : " You Can Trust Jack Westland . " <P> Apparently he did n't need practice : one day last week Jack Westland found himself in the finals again , after 21 years . In the seven earlier rounds , such former champions as Billy Maxwell ( 1951 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1949 ) had all gone down . Jack 's opponent was Spokane 's young ( 23 ) Al Mengert , who had diligently been reducing his score ever since he got out of the U.S. Air Force last June . <P> After going one up over Mengert on the cold , clear morning 18-hole round , Jack , who had chain-smoked all the way , seemed to feel his age . He got his stiff muscles rubbed down in the locker room . At 2 o'clock , before a gallery now grown to some 8,000 , Jack and Al teed off again . Some openly doubted that the older man could weather the afternoon round . Al Mengert , though wet-browed under the strain , went one up over Westland on the ninth hole to lead for the first time . <P> Westland just went on playing a painstaking , precise game that brought , not applause , but " Gee , gee , gee " from the gallery . Soon he was two up . Then on the 16th hole ( 468 yds . ) , Jack sent his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Mengert 's sailed into a sand trap . Westland arched his approach to within a scant yard of the cup . Mengert exploded out , then overputted the hole . Jack sank his short one . That was it . <P> The winner , 3 and 2 , and oldest U.S. Amateur champ of all time , tossed his blue cap high in the air . His wife Monica , who has never seen him play ( " I 'm bad luck " ) , rushed from the clubhouse radio to give him a hug . People kept yelling " Hi , Mr. Congressman ! " and the photographers converged on the champ , shouting : " We 've been waiting for a week . " Said Jack , with a grin : " I 've been waiting 21 years . "
