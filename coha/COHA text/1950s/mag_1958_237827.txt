Christianity in Africa entered a new phase last week : for the first time in the two centuries that missionaries have been sowing the Gospel seed among the continent 's jungles , veldts and hills , the Protestant churches of Africa met together . Some 200 leaders gathered for a ten-day All-Africa Church Conference at St. Anne 's Anglican Girls ' School at Ibadan , Nigeria . <P> The delegates came from 21 African countries , from French , English , Belgian and Portuguese colonies , from such independent states as Ghana , Sudan , Egypt , Ethiopia , Liberia and the Union of South Africa . They included Methodists , Presbyterians , Lutherans , Episcopalians , Dutch Reformed and " soldiers " of the Salvation Army . The ten days they spent together aired out many a mind that had been shut up in tribal parochialism . Said Anglican Archdeacon Erisa K. Masaba : " We in Uganda do n't accept the Christians from our neighboring territory of Kenya as real Christians . For me it is a surprise to see members of different churches worshiping together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the Kenya Christians as just the same as ourselves . " <P> Two Roman Catholic priests were present as observers . Also on hand were Dr. W. A. Visser ' t Hooft , General Secretary of the World Council of Churches , and Dr. John Mackay , honorary chairman of the International Missionary Council . South African Novelist Alan ( Cry the Beloved Country ) Paton was named one of a five-man committee to explore ways and means of developing the Ibadan conference into a continuing association . <P> Major problems discussed centered around African sex and marriage customs such as the importance of the " bride-price " and the practice of female circumcision Some delegates advised against moving too fast in eliminating either , on grounds that to most Africans the bride price is the most tangible token of a marriage and that uncircumcised girls under present circumstances find it almost impossible to get anyone within their own tribes to marry them . " Hasty action , " said one delegate , " will only create new problems-problems of husbandless women roaming the streets . " <P> Delegates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition with Christianity . Warned Anglican Bishop Solomon Odutola of Eastern Nigeria : " The spirit behind Islam is ' What shall I do to be saved ? " The average person prefers Islam 's simple answer of what to do . It appeals to him more than Christianity 's deeper and more complicated method of what to be , to be saved . "
