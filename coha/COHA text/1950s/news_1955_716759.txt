txt President Eisenhower asked Congress today for new power to reduce foreign trade barriers . He called such power " essential for the security of the United States and the rest of the world . " In a special message , the first of a series to be submitted in support of his legislative program , the President specifically proposed the following : ( IA three-year extension of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act , with authority to reduce tariffs below present limits in exchange for trade concessions by other countries . Further simplification of customs procedures . ' ; Special tax concessions on foreign earnings of United States business . Wuty-free allowances for tourists returning from abroad of $1,000 instead of the present $500 . The allowance could be exercised every six months . The recommendations were almost identical to those laid down last March 30 in the President 's first special message on the subject . Except for some ref on in customs procedures , the last grass , controlled by Republicans , set the program aside pending further study . It substituted a simple one-year extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next June 12 . Some Factions Plan Fight With the Democrats now in charge of Congress and a Republican President proposing legislation that is in harmony with the Democratic party 's traditional position it appeared likely that the tariff issue would be considered in a nonpartisan atmosphere for the first time . Factions of both parties , however , were preparing to do battle . Many industries , according to leaders of these factions , can not stand the foreign competition generated even by present tariff levels . Mandatory restrictions on imports of various products , notably fuel oil and some minerals , probably will be sought . Administration forces were cheered , meanwhile , by word that Representative Daniel A. Reed , Republican of upstate New York , was planning to take a back seat in his fight . In the past , Mr. Reed has been a leader of high-tariff Republicans . It was largely clue to his influence that the President 's trade program was set aside last year , when Mr. Reed was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee . While he had no public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it known today that he wished to avoid an open disputer with the Administration over the tariff issue . It was understood that he probably would confine his opposition to closed meetings of the Ways and Means Committee , which has initial jurisdiction . Mr. Reed 's attitude is in line with a gradual tempering of his public pronouncements against Administration policies since his unsuccessful fight in 1953 for an immediate end to the now-expired excess profits tax on corporations . Since then , Administration officials have taken pains to consult him in advance on legislative proposals in the Ways and Means Committee 's jurisdiction . Terms Program ' Moderate ' In his special message , President Eisenhower used the word " moderate " rather than " liberal 's to describe his trade program , which is based on recommendations of a special commission headed Clarence B. Randall , Chicago industrialist . He urged its approval by Congress in " our own self-interest " on three principal grounds , as follows : " ( 1 ) Economic strength among our Allies is essential to our security : ( 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instability growing out of the vulnerability of such areas to Communist penetration and subversion ; and ( 3 ) an increasing volume of world production and trade will help assure our own economic growth and a rising standard of living among our own people . " The measure of mutual security of the free nations , he asserted , " is dependent upon the economic strength of all free nations , for without economic strength they can not support the military establishments that are necessary to deter Communist armed aggression . " Proposed Powers Listed The President assured Congress that tariff cuts , would be " moderate , gradual and reciprocal . " " Radical or sudden tariff reductions would not be to the interest of the United States and would not accomplish the goal we seek , " he said . He asked for a three-year extension of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act , under which he now may fix tariffs within a 50 per cent range of 1945 rates . Most of the tariff-cutting authority under that statute has been exhausted . Under the proposed renewal , the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 per cent each year below levels of next July 1 . In addi- , tion , he could reduce to 50 per cent ad valorem ( of value ) any tariff now above that level and halve the 1945 rates on articles that are now being imported only in " negligible " quantities , if at all . An Administration bill to carry out those recommendations was introduced last Thursday by Representative Jere Cooper of , Tennessee , the new Democratic ' chairman of the Ways and Means I Committee . It will be the first major legislative business to come before the committee and , 1 probably , the House . The com-1 mittee will begin hearings on the Cooper bill Monday . ' On customs procedures , the ! President proposed improvement of standards for valuation of imports and simplification of commodity definitions , classifications and rate structures . To facilitate investment of ( United States capital abroad , he renewed his request for a lower tax rate on business income from foreign subsidiaries and branches . The President proposed a cut of fourteen percentage points in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At present levels , the proposed rate would be 38 per cent of earnings instead of 52 . President Eisenhower also proposed that the tax be deferred until the funds were taken from the country where earned , He recommended Congressional approval " at the proper time ' of United States participation in a proposed $100,000,000 International Finance Corporation that would invest in private enterprises in underdeveloped countries . Among other measures aimed at advancement of the nonindustrial countries , President Eisenhower recommended continued support ' for technical cooperation programs of the United States and the United Nations . Funds will be requested in his Budget Message next Monday . For all types of foreign aid , he is expected , to request about $3,000 , - 000,000 in new funds , bringing the total to more than $50,000 , - 000,000 since 1945 . Once the reciprocal trade bill has been disposed of by the House , the various other foreign trade recommendations requiring legislation are expected to be handled separately .                   @ @
