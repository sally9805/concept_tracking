France 's Algiers-born Albert Camus ( The Stranger , The Plague , The Fall ) was a man of the theater long before he turned novelist . As a poor , radical student in 1934 , he started Algeria 's only theater , for which he wrote , acted , directed . To get experience , he used to play one-night stands all over North Africa , finally wrote three dramas between 1944 and 1949 . Fellow actors remember him as pale , sickly , with " an extraordinary radiance . " Last week the Camus radiance was back onstage , in one of the year 's most exciting theatrical events : the opening in Paris of Camus ' long-awaited dramatic version of Dostoevsky 's The Possessed . Le Monde expressed the consensus of Paris critics : " A magnificent and stupendous spectacle . " <P> Said Dostoevsky : " If there is no everlasting God , there is no such thing as virtue . " The Possessed was partly written to illuminate that point . The book swept from Russia 's liberals , who reveled in sentimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nihilists of the 1870s , who believed that terrorism was justified as a means to political reform . Camus read the book at 20 ( " A soul-shaking experience " ) . Like Dostoevsky , Camus broods about the ailment of freedom without God , about political mass murder in the name of life and the future . Although he has been unable to accept Dostoevsky 's remedy ( return to God and the soil ) , he says : " The real 19th century prophet was Dostoevsky , not Karl Marx . " <P> As both playwright and director of The Possessed , Camus combined his evolving philosophy with his considerable theatrical skill . To handle the novel 's bewildering rush toward chaos , Camus uses an onstage narrator who streamlines the transition between scenes ( some take only eight seconds ) . The play roils with the deluded intrigues of nihilists , whom Camus makes strongly reminiscent of modern Marxists . Perhaps the play 's chief quality is Camus ' adroit emphasis of Nikolay Stavrogin ( ably played by Pierre Vaneck ) , the book 's most memorably monstrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of Nietzschean superman . He instigates a band of young revolutionaries to murder , rapes his landlady 's little daughter , finally commits suicide . In the hands of Camus , Stavrogin emerges as a modern man , a desperate seeker of God who does not know where to look . Says another character in The Possessed : " When he believes , he does not believe that he believes , and when he does not believe , he does not believe that he does not believe . "
