txt Russia refused tonight to grant independence to Austria and chose instead a course that means the end of the four-nation parley here . Vyacheslav M. Molotov , Russia 's foreign minister , chairman of the conference of the foreign ministers of the United States , Britain , France , and Russia for the day , announced that the conference would end on Thursday . The foreign ministers have worked for 23 days and have made no progress on any point of their program . The people of Austria were promised independence 10 years ago and had hoped that they would achieve it in a peace treaty to be shaped in this conference . The hopes of seven million Austrians were dashed , however , when Mole+ tov set new conditions and made virtually impossible an agreement on a proposal submitted today by State Secretary Dulles . Russia 's Old Terms Met In a formal resolution , the United States requested that the Austrian treaty as proposed in 1949 by Russia be accepted in full and that the Austrian treaty be signed on Thursday . The resolution stressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austria would accept five disputed articles contained in the draft of the treaty . Georges Bidault , foreign minister of France , and Leopold Figl , foreign minister of Austria , gave Dulles ' proposal their support . Molotov then submitted amendments based on demands that were rejected yesterday by Pie other nations . The most objectionable of these provided that foreign troops , instead of being withdrawn from Austrian territory within 90 days ? after the conclusion of the treaty , as originally agreed upon , would remain pending conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany . Neutral Austria Demanded Molotov also requested the insertion of clauses stipulating the neutralization of Austria , dissolution of the four nation control commission in Vienna , and withdrawal of all foreign troops from Vienna . He withdrew a proposal that the foreign ministers ' deputies be appointed to complete the draft t r eat y within three months , e laining this no longer was necessary as the conferees had reached an agreement on the draft treaty .

Dulles said that Molotov 's proposal would compel Austria to pay for independence that she is not receiving . " The United States will not be a partner to this kind of fraud , " he added . Then he asked Molotov . to reconsider the proposed amendments . The Russian tried to- justify his new conditions on the ground that there had been developments since the treaty was drafted five years ago .

" Foreign Secretary Eden of Britain said that Molotov 's stand on the Austrian treaty would necessitate an agreement on four irrelevant questions : There was the problem of Trieste ; since foreign troops were not to be withdrawn from Austria until a German reunification , agreement on that question must be reached ; the European defense community EDC must be scrapped , and the North Atlantic Tr ea t y organization NATO must be broken up . Discussions will be resumed tomorrow at the Russian embassy in East Berlin . ' Tell Red A-Proposal A western informant said that Russia had asked that Red China be brought into any international parley on President Eisenhower 's proposal that a pool be created to advance the world 's peaceful use of atomic energy . American reaction to the request was said to have been negative .                 @ @ @ @
