No Orchids for Miss Blandish ( Renown ) , made in England , purports to be a movie about U.S. gangsters . Adapted from a claptrap novel by Britain 's James Hadley Chase ( real name : Rene Raymond ) , who once confessed cribbing from U.S. hard-boiled fiction , the picture outraged London ( TIME , May 10 , 1948 ) . Censors howled that it was brutal , sadistic , sensual ; critics slammed it as " a piece of nauseating muck . " <P> Last week a wave of shock ads ( " No one under 16 will be admitted " ) ushered the claptrap into Manhattan . New York critics brushed the picture off with amused disdain . Whether taken as an inept counterfeit of Hollywood gangster movies or a witless parody , No Orchids is so ludicrous that its thugs ' thinly disguised British accents seem minor imperfections.
