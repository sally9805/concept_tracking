OIL &; GAS <P> " This ruling could be a real economic disaster for the pipeline companies . " So last week said Willard W. Gatchell , general counsel for the Federal Power Commission , as the $1.8 billion-a-year natural gas pipeline industry began to feel the impact of a precedent-setting court decision . Handed down recently by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia , the little publicized ruling would i ) greatly curtail FPC 's authority to control interstate natural gas prices , and 2 ) give every major gas consumer the power to block a rate increase . <P> The case started in 1955 , when the United Gas Pipeline Co. of Shreveport , La. asked the Federal Power Commission for permission to boost the rates for the 600-plus cities and industries it serves . Since FPC raised no objections during the usual six months ' waiting period , United raised its rates . But then the city of Memphis , one of the cities that was hit by the raise , appealed to the federal court . The court held that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the consent of its customers . The court ordered United to return the millions it had collected in rate increases since it put the raise into effect . <P> The ruling was based on a 1956 U.S. Supreme Court decision that rate changes may not be made without the consent of the consumer if the supplying company is under contract to the consumer . It brushed aside United 's argument that its contract in the disputed case had stated that " All gas shall be paid for under the seller 's rate schedule , or any effective superseding rate schedules on file with the FPC . " The appeals court decision means that any superseding schedules , i.e. , higher rates not objected to by the FPC , may be upset by a customer 's objection . In jeopardy is about $300 million in recent rate increases . <P> Taking heart from the decision , other consumers began to protest . Two subsidiaries of California 's Pacific Lighting Corp . objected to a $10,000,000 yearly rate increase proposed by El Paso Natural Gas Co. , urged the FPC to refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As long as the ruling stands , gas suppliers will have to negotiate separate rate scales with every industrial or municipal consumer , rather than setting a flat rate for all of them . As for the FPC , not only will its rate-regulating powers be cut , but it will have to hire about 1,200 new employees to handle the job of examining the legality of each individual rate contract . Gas suppliers and the FPC both said that they would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision .
