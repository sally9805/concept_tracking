txt Relief in New York City is not being handled any more efficiently today than it was four years ago , an atmosphere of poor morale and " confusion and desperation " exists in the welfare centers and turnover of both investigators and supervisors in the Department of Welfare is " excessively high , " it was charged yesterday by the New ' York State Department of Social Welfare . These charges were made as the state gave the city a report based on an examination of 1.000 public assistance cases in five welfare centers and a supplementary study ' of administrative operations in three welfare centers in New York . The period surveyed was from December , 1949 , through Novem- , ber. 1950 . In reply to the state 's charges , Henry L. McCarthy , City Welfare Commissioner , said " It appears , that the state has decided to defend itself in advance by this ' attack on the city administration . " He referred to surveys , as yet Unpublished , which , he said , were " sharply critical " of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and continuous control over local administration of public welfare . " He accused the state of issuing the ' report while the Legislature was in session to embarrass the city 's request- for additional state aid for welfare . The state found one-fourth of the 1.000 cases lacked sufficient documentation for eligibility and informed the city that it owed the state and Federal governments 80 per cent of an amount " slightly in excess " of $200,000. the total assistance incorrectly granted . " Unusual ' Measures " Needed Because of this situation , the state " is compelled to require unusual measures to insure the validity of public-assistance payments in New York City , " Robert T. Lansdale , State Social Welfare Commissioner , wrote Mr. McCarthy in a letter accompanying the report . To protect the state , the Federal ' Government and the city , the state plans an audit system designed to " stop improper payments promptly and at the source  --  the local welfare center , " Commissioner Lansdale said . The new set-up/will require the approval of the Federal Security Agency before it is undertaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Federal officials to install and operate , he added . " The New York City office of this department will be in touch with you shortly about this plan , " Commissioner Lansdale told Commissioner McCarthy . The amounts of improper expenditures in individual cases ranged from less than $25 to more than $5.000 , the state charged . In 20 per cent of the cases they exceeded $1.000 a case ; in 37 per cent , between $100 and $1,000 , and in 43 per cent less than $100 . Proofs Held Lacking " It is clear that the city department , fox ? one reason or another , has not got to the heart of the problem  --  to grant public funds only to those whose legal eligibility has been documented , " said Commissioner Lansdale . If the results of the study were applied to the entire public-assistance roll during the period surveyed , " the deductions which would have to be made by the state and Federal governments would rim into millions of dollars , " he noted . " This loss of state and Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern , " wrote Commissioner Lansdale . " But from the standpoint of efficient and competent administration , the most disturbing fact is that of the 1,000 cases reviewed , information per- taming to basic eligibility was ini-1 tially absent in 824 of the cases . " The state chose what it consid- ered 1,000 typical cases from among the 300,000 persons receiving public assistance in New York ' in 1950 . One case might involve several persons , such as a mother With several dependent children . In these cases , one or more fac- tors of major importance relating to need or special categorical eligi- ; bility had not been adequately ' documented in the case records , and the state had to return the cases for further information . A total of 280 cases were found , finally , to lack sufficient documentation of eligibility for part or all of the assistance granted . To establish the causes of these inadequacies in the determination of eligibility and amount of payments , theupplementary study . was made of certain pertinent administrative operations in three of the five welfare centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reasons for Inadequacies The reasons the state found for ' the inadequacies were : 1 . Inadequate case handling caused ; by pressures arising from poor ' administrative planning and a ' lack of consideration of the workload of the centers. 2 . Caseloads per worker consist- , ently higher than standards , mutually agreed upon . 3 . An excessively high turnover . among both social investigators , and supervisors . 4 . Social service staff shifted from ; one location to another or to special projects to the detriment of a steady , efficient level of administration . 5 . Constant change in the responsibility for handling caseloads. 6 . Poor planning in the use of stenographic and clerical staff . In addition to these " disrupting conditions , " another factor that impedes efficiency is the " complicated and - time-consuming system " used by the city to determine the amount of assistance to be granted and authorizing payment S to be made , the report maintained . The state has proposed simplified methods and the city 's " resistance " to the adoption of these methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been some improvement in the initial determination of eligibility , that is , the handling of new applications , but the city has not succeeded in overcoming " inalequate performance in the equally critical area of continuing eligibility , that is , in the handling of cases already on the relief rolls , " the report said . Rhatigan Seen Vindicated Many authorities declare that this report is , in a sense , a vindication of former Welfare Commissioner Edward Rhatigan 's administration and ' staff , since under more recent regimes in which " efficiency , " " good management " and " Communist-hunting " was stressed the results showed little improvement in determining eligibility . Commissioner Rhatigan , who resigned under fire , was succeeded by Raymond M. Hilliard . Commissioner McCarthy has been in office only this past year . Some who commented on the state report point to a sentence in it that says , " In every welfare center visited there was an atmosphere of confusion and desperation . " They say that , until that feeling is eliminated , until the employes at the centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' salaries , there will be little progress made in correcting " inefficiency " where difficult work is made even more difficult because ! of the intangible nature of the ; helping process and the feelings of resentment aroused in many a tax-1 payer at the mention of the word ! " welfare . " This is the second major survey of the city department in four years and each time that a survey finds the department inadequate not only the regular staff suffers , the ones who remain year after year no matter how many commissioners come and go , but so do the deserving relief recipients , authorities say . At this point , however . some of the experts believe that " the situation may have to get worse before it gets better . " , Turnover Figures Cited Turnover figures have jumped Incredibly , according to the study . ' It shows that departures . which ( include resignations , transfers out ; and leaves of absence , increased in. the Amsterdam Welfare Center ; from 3.3 per cent in 1949 to 21.1 : per cent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of 1951.1 At the Borough Park Welfare ; Center they rose from 4.3 per cent ' in 1949 to 31.3 per cent in 1950 ' and 26.8 per cent in the first eight ! months of 1951 . At Queens Wel- ! fare Center they rose from 5.2 per , cent in 1949 to ** cent in , 1950 and 19.8 per cent for the first . eight months in 1951 . More than half of the current departures in all three centers are ' resignations , which also appear to ' , be on the increase , the state found . ' The cases studied included 2601 home relief , 220 aid to dependent ; children and 520 old-age assistance cases . The areas of eligibility that were not thoroughly explored ! or well-documented and that need-1 ed the most careful follow-up in- ; eluded resources , employment and ; employability , responsible relatives ' i and budget items incident to need , I the study found . There was also little evidence in the case records that investigators adequately used the advice and information of the various consultant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' home economics , it.held . The study also ' criticized the amount of clerical detail , which appeared to " overwhelm " investigators and supervisors . In concluding his letter to Commissioner McCarthy , Commissioner Lansdale said : " As you are aware , this department has consistently refused to ' make any statement regarding the operation of the New York City Department of Welfare since the board 's report of March . 1948 . While keeping track of developments in the city department and aiding where we could in your re-. organization , it has been our view that the city should have ample ' time to improve its operation . The report transmitted herewith represents an appraisal of your department 's operation . as of 1951 . We believe it is our obligation to inform the public of this appraisal . "
