How deeply has the recession chewed into U.S. corporate profits ? The Federal Reserve Board last week reported that in the first quarter of 1958 , after-tax profits of manufacturing corporations tumbled 40.7% compared to first quarter 1957 . Nondurable producers were off 32.1% , while durable-goods producers fell 46.1% , with primary metals and metal products ( down 54% ) and auto companies ( down 52.2% ) taking the worst licking . Yet once again Wall Street was busy looking ahead instead of backwards . With steady rises in most important groups , the stock market climbed another 5.17 points on the Dow-Jones industrial average to new high ground for the year at 474.77 , just a little better than midway between the boom-time high and the recession low . <P> What Wall Street saw : <P> Chain store sales last month rose sharply , were 5.1% better than 1957 . Total sales for 44 big chains so far this year : $6.7 billion , 3.7% higher than last year . <P> Private housing starts jumped 7,300 units in May , passing a rate of 1,000,000 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers turned up in May as dealers started rebuilding depleted stocks . Though the rise might be seasonal the National Electrical Manufacturers Assn. reported electric ranges up 7% , refrigerators up 33% , farm and home freezers up 19% . <P> Auto production increased another 11.2% last week to keep time with rising sales , though so far this year it is still 34.1% behind 1957 . <P> <P> Industrial production rose to 127 in May on the Federal Reserve Board index , up a point since April and the first rise in nine months . <P> As for prices-they looked to be on the way up , too . Both Westinghouse President Mark W. Cresap Jr . and General Electric President Robert Paxton saw little chance of a price cut in appliances , instead talked of price increases forced on the industry by higher labor and material costs . In steel , which picked up speed to a scheduled operating rate of 63.8% , a little price cutting cropped up in the Detroit area , where Great Lakes Steel Corp . chopped prices $2 a ton . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread . The industry soon expects to hike prices to cover the automatic wage increase going into effect on July 1 . Consensus : probably $5-$6 per ton .
