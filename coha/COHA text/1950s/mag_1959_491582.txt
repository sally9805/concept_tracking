I t was not much over a year ago when a rotund little man with a thickGerman accent , glowing dark eyes and a breast pocket full of cigars marched into the New York regional headquarters of the Federal Housing Administration in Jamaica , Long Island . By the time he was ready to leave , having talked his way from one astounded official to another , the Title II department , which deals in home mortgages , was awash with shattered consonants , mangled cigars and lively curiosity . " We knew a little about Herbert Richheimer , " Herbert K. Cronin , chief underwriter , told me . " But the business and background he described seemed incredible . And his proposal was something that , as far as we knew , had never been tried . Not in our territory , anyway . Yet we had to admit , if he was as good as he claimed , that it also made sense . " 26 The proposal , very simply , was that FHA , through its insurance of mortgages , help people improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal agency has stimulated the building and sale of new homes . As millions of couples who have set up housekeeping in recent years are aware , the amount of cash required for the purchase of a new dwelling under a long-term FHA-insured mortgage is small , and the monthly payments are often less than those paid for rent . " So why not offer as favorable terms for a loan on a house that is lived in , if the family wants to stay there , but needs a large amount of money to improve the place ? " was the question Richheimer tossed in the lap of the FHA . " This helps the family , the banks and my business , which is home improvements . Why not  --  especially since the law itself says it can be done ? " The heavy-set , intense little man was right , and as Cronin and his associates soon verified , he was genuine too . They trooped to Levittown , Long Island , to double-check , and came away impressed by Richheimer 's colorful salesrooms , filled with educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modern Home Improvements ; by the manner in which his salesmen and construction crews work with customers ; and by the respect he has earned in the community , more despite than because of the phenomenal speed with which he mushroomed from nowhere to success .

He set out on his own in July of 1954 with capital assets of sixty-seven dollars , which was the Richheimer family bank account .

Or they may work at only one trade , such as carpentry or plumbing . The homeowner may be involved with half a dozen different specialists  --  architect , financial institution , mason , plumber , carpenter and electrician  --  to bring a major alteration to completion . His path is complicated and strewn with pitfalls . Guidance all the way is Richheimer 's business . Every happy solution brings him added customers . " There 's no one in the nation quite like him , " I was told by Don Moore , executive director of the Home Improvement Council , an organization of manufacturers and other leaders in the building trade , which promotes and reports on home modernization in hundreds of communities . " If his approach and ' one-stop ' type of operation were available everywhere , homeowners would be living a lot better and I 'd be out of my job . " The FHA-insured mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , has generated a million dollars ' worth of business for Richheimer and solved housing dilemmas for more than 300 families since the first home-improvement loan of this type was granted in April , 1958 . It took six months of negotiations with the local banks and the New York office of FHA as well as a major reorganization of RichheiTher 's estimating procedures to put the plan into effect . The first loan was written for a young electrical engineer , Alex Grunewald , and his wife , who live in Levittown . It ended a family crisis for the Grunewalds for half the money they had expected to pay . When the Grunewalds bought their home from Levitt and Sons in 1950 for $8000 they were both still in college . The Levitts were midway in a building spree which covered seven square miles of Long Island potato fields with 17,500 small houses set side by side along endless miles of little roads . It was widely predicted that Levittown , within a few years , would become the nation 's largest suburban slum . There were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , a rectangle twenty-five by thirty feet which contained two bedrooms , a bath , a kitchen , a living room , stairs and an unfinished attic on a sixty-foot lot . When the original Cape Cod type grew into the rancher , the house expanded from thirty to thirty-two feet . Other variations were purely external  --  a change in windows , a break in the roof line , a carport tacked on the side . No one had ever peppered as vast an area of flat landscape with so many look-alikes , and a deadly monotony of existence seemed the inevitable result . The Grunewalds refused to worry about the future when they could buy a home cheaper than paying rent . Besides , there were community swimming pools , schools , shopping centers and plans for tiny trees and shrubs hopefully promising future shade around the houses . Three years after the Grunewalds moved , the first baby came  --  a boy . Then another boy within two years . In 1956 , Mrs. Grunewald 's mother and father came to live with their children in Levittown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their attic , which provided a large bedroom , living room and bath upstairs . Then , last year , a baby daughter was born . " We storied to look for a four- or five-bedroom house as soon as we knew the baby was coming , " Mrs. Grunewald explained . " We could n't find anything new much under thirty thousand , and the older places were not where we chose to live . Actually , we wanted to stay in Levittown , but did n't see how we could , knowing how much cash we 'd have to spend to enlarge the house again . " Mrs. Grunewald 's desire to remain in Levittown , predictions to the contrary , is shared by a majority of the families who reside there . The apple and other trees , which father Abraham Levitt insisted on planting , are as high as the houses and fill the winding lanes with green , The schools were built long ago , and as another housewife remarked , " We 've been through the mill on taxes here and know where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you might have to pay . They sell you a house for one hundred and twenty-five dollars a month today , and tomorrow the taxes run it up to a hundred and fifty or more . " Levittown houses bring a premium today  --  S 10,000 to 513,000 for the basic home which originally cost $7000 to 59000 , and up to 520,000 for those with improvements . Families who had moved away have bought their way back into this super-suburbia where all ages , faiths and income levels seem to get along well together . Elderly , retired couples , for whom the basic house is room enough , have moved in , More often , though , the newcomers or returnees purchase an improved , enlarged home . There are literally miles of streets where a property without improvements is the exception , rather than the rule . The Levitts , incidentally , planned their house for additions . The birth rate and owner pride in having a house just a little different , or better , than the one next door , have done the rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost 2000 home-improvement jobs in Levittown , even though only 30 per cent of his work now is in that community . Other contractors have participated too ; but the only firms that rival Richheimer in size are specialists who build dormers or garages or some other component , and nothing else . The Grunewalds ' first tip that there might be a way out of their dilemma came through a community magazine , the bible of every Levittown housewife and do-it-yourselfer , aptly titled Thousand Lanes . " An article suggested refinancing the mortgage as a way to get money for expansion , " Mrs. Grunewald said . " So we called Richheimer 's . H is salesman gave us an estimate of the cost , and suggested we try for an FHA thirty-year loan . " Richheimer had been financing some jobs with conventional mortgages . " It was after the recession began , in September , 1957 , that I figured the thirty-year term , available through FHA , which means smaller monthly payments , would help my customers and stimulate business , " he told me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Levittown , either  --  were looking for new homes to get more space , although they really did n't want to move . The FHA deal meant that we could enlarge homes for many who just could n't swing the purchase of a new house . " The Grunewalds ' monthly payments , to cover mortgage , interest and taxes , were eighty-two dollars . They owed about 57000 on their house . They contracted with Richheimer for a fourteen-foot addition to go across the rear of the house , which doubled the size of their living room and provided a third ground-floor bedroom , the installation of a new furnace and for a concrete patio along the side of the house . including heat pipes in the slab so it could be used as the floor for a dining room in the future . The cost of the work was 55750 . FHA appraised the house , with these additions at 516,000 and approved a thirty-year loan of $13,500 . This sum paid off the original mortgage . covered the cost of the improvements and also took care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wound up with monthly payments at 5I 18 . " It would have taken up to $10,000 down payment and at least 5200a month to buy a place big enough for us and my parents too , " Mrs. Gruncwald remarked . " Not to mention the cost and mess of moving . This way we 're playing it safe and also can afford the extras that always crop up when you move or prove , like screens or shutters and paint to decorate . The addition to the house , incidentally , was handled so it hardly dis . turbed us at all . " Mrs. Grunewald described how the floor and roof for the addition were built first , then the rear wall  --  mostly win ? dows  --  of her house was lifted bodily and set in its new position in a matter of an hour or two . She also spoke of the esprit de corps of Richheimer 's men . " They act like they belong to a sort of club , " she said . " Nobody 's grouchy ; you do n't hale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't pester you for cof- fee or soft drinks all the time . " She rounded out this fabulous idyl of happy , considerate workmen with an accolade to Bill Kearns , who is one of Richheimer 's construction superintendents , " The architect 's plan showed a shed roof for the addition , " she said , " but Bill decided a hip roof would look more attractive with the big dormer above it across the rear of the house . I agreed , and that 's the way it was done , but at no extra cost to us . " I asked Kearns about the Grunewald roof , and he admitted the hip construction cost more . " But their house is on a corner , " he explained , " and the back is seen even more than the front . She wanted it to look nice , and we did too . " Richheimer 's men are privileged to depart from plans and spend a few extra dollars if necessary to give their customers precisely what they want , or to avoid trouble later on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or back or sometimes both , to add a second story to single-story homes is a common job . Richheimer has special crews who do nothing else , appearing on the scene at eight in the morning and not leaving until the shell of the dormer is complete and the roof safely back in place . 1 visited one of these jobs in Valley Stream where the carpenters were finishing off the inside . The house had been sold originally with flooring in the attic . " We 'll have to take up the old flooring and renail it , " Bob Driscoll , another Richheimer superintendent , told the owner . " It 's too loose the way it is for us to install underlayment for plastic tile . " Driscoll explained later that he had told the owner , not to impress him with the extra work they were doing , but to be sure he understood why the job would take longer to complete . " We should have figured it when the estimate was made , " he said . " It 's our headache now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to work loose in a few months , and we 'll realty be in trouble . " " This is a perfect example of how the home-improvement business gets a bad name , " Richheimer told me . " If that job was one of only two or three that we were doing , instead of one among a hundred , the temptation would be to put on the tile and pray it would n't work loose . The owner is n't going to understand if you come back and ask for more money to fix something you did n't spot in the first place . Yet re-laying the floor may take much , if not all our profit out of the deal . Two or three mistakes like that , if a little fellow , and I go broke . Or if I do n't fix it , and the floor goes bad , I get a poor name and no more business . " So what do you do ? " Herbert Richheimer paused to light a cigar and fairly jiggled with intense emotion . This was January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out first what the customer needs and can afford . They 're not always the same thing . Then you estimate right , and list for yourself and for him everything that goes into the job  --  everything , except maybe nails and screws . You do an honest job , and in such a way that the customer is consulted and considered right through to the finish . If you do these things , with not too many mistakes , you have a business  --  and it grows . " Hit blood pressure mounts to thumping levels at the thought of the millions of homeowners who , in his opinion , arc potential customers for better service than they often receive . Estimates of the yearly dollar volume of home improvements run as high as $14,000,000,000 . FHA 's current underwriting of short-term home-modernization loans , for instance , covers 1,250,000 transactions , averaging about 51000 apiece , " Think of it , " Richheimer says . " Fourteen billions a year , and it is n't a real industry . It 's just a hodgepodge , Think of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thousands of communities . All they need is the ambition and to know how to go about it right . " The assumption that a Richheimer waits in every community is overly optimistic , His is a unique combination of the persuasive salesman and the stickler for business detail in one solid , Germanic chunk . Richheimer refers to himself as " a Heinle , " and both amuses and confuses business associates when he is working with figures , which he calculates audibly in German . He came to America in 1937 when he was orphaned at fourteen , and lived with an aunt and uncle in Elmhurst , Long Island . He was an outstanding athlete in high school , met the girl who became his wife at the time and served four years in the Army during World War II . Richheimer married after the war and worked as a salesman , eventually becoming manager of the New York office of an air-freight company . The demands of the Teamsters Union forced the company to close its New York office , and he went to work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , in 1952 , when the Richheimers ' city landlord raised the rent , and the family , which now included three boys , moved to Levittown . " I needed three hundred and ninety dollars for the down payment , " Richheimer says , " and all I had was two hundred and ninety dollars . I was too proud to ask my wife 's family for the one hundred dollars . A girl in the office then offered me the money , but I said could n't take it from her . We had given up the idea of the house until , a few days later , I found the hundred and a note from the girl in my overcoat pocket . l bought the house , and believe me , I 've never forgotten what that hundred dollars meant . It made my whole life . " He had been in Levittown only about a year when an Italian who was laying a concrete front walk for a neighbor solicited him for a similar job . Salesman Richheimer turned the tables and offered beget business for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that fellow for weeks , but he would n't take me on , " he told me . " So I found another concrete man and spent my weekends writing up orders for walks , stoops and carport paving . Nearly everywhere 1 went people would ask about other improvements  --  building a fence , fixing up the attic , all sorts of carpenter work . So 1 hunted up a good contractor and made a deal . " His weekend commissions began to approach the money he made the balance of the time commuting to New York . The contractor had to add nine men to his crew to handle the flood of orders . " That 's when I figured I was crazy not to build a business for myself , " Richheimer says . He sold the little Cape Cod model he had improved by finishing off the attic , and bought another Levitt house which had been enlarged both by an addition upstairs and by building a garage and extra kitchen space or . the side . It cost Richheimer $6000 more than the house he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a hank on a three-year-repayment plan , to put the house in tiptop shape . Whereupon Herbert Richheimer , w ho admits he ca n't drive a nail or even draw a straight line , invited all of Levittown to see the sort of improvements he had to offer , displayed in his " model " home . The open house was a great success and convinced Richheimer that the way to sell home improvements was to show people exactly what they were buying , rather than expect them to unravel plans . This is the basis for his Museum of Modern Home Improvements . " A Mrs. Helen Hicks , who worked as a nurse , wanted an addition to her house , and came in with a scale model she had made . I asked her if she could make it so the piece that was the addition could be taken of or added on . " Mrs. Hicks told Richheimer she could , and he commissioned her to make similar models of every type of house in Levittown . He has since accumulated more than 100 little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dormers , side additions , porches and garages which fit onto them , He also has cutaway models which show the rooms inside . " It makes it easy for a salesman to show the husband and wife exactly how an addition to the house will look , " Richheimer says , " and the blocks keep the kids happy when it comes time to figure costs and do other paper work . " A miniature Levittown , which shows about twenty homes , each one altered or added to , covers a big table just inside the office door , " Actually , we do n't need this any more , " Richheimer comments . " All you have to do in Levittown today , to see how an addition will look , is to visit your neighbors . " The most common improvements in the community , incidentally , are dormers and a rather simple alteration known locally as " squaring the kitchen . " Levitt 's basic plan provided a front door at the corner of the house , which opened into a little hallway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear , was cut out of the kitchen . " Squaring the kitchen " involves a change in the entranceway , putting the doorway at the side of the house . This allows the kitchen to expand into the former hallway space . The Grunewalds had Richheimer 's men " square " their kitchen , for which they paid 5395 cash . Evenings  --  Saturday evenings in particular  --  are the busy time at Richheimer 's showroom , which now extends into another store and through the basements as well . Families spend much of their time in the basement where actual playrooms , baths , kitchens , dens , dining rooms , and even a small dormer room have been built . There are , in addition , samples of construction  --  the right and the wrong methods , for instance , to flash a roof or to lay plastic tile . " People like these educational exhibits best of all , " Richheimer finds . " The women , as well as the men . " His men are helpful to do-it-yourself husbands and wives . Painting and decorating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll put up just the bare bones of an addition  --  no inside ceiling or walls , for instance  --  if that 's all the customer wants , " Richheimer explained . " A fourth of our work is done that way . But we 'd rather leave the job ready for decorating , if the owner can afford it . Too many times the place goes uncompleted for months , maybe years ; or it 's obviously an amateur finish . This does n't help the family or us , either . " Happy customers , as Richheimer and the ten salesmen he employs never forget , are the reason why their business , late in 1957 and on through 1958 , increased several hundred per cent while others were dropping behind . John B. Anderson , manager of installment credit for the Levittown branch of The Franklin National Bank , which will lend about 55 $1,000,000 this year to Richheimer 's customers on notes that run up to five years , pulled his Herbert Richheimer , Inc. , file to show me there were no complaints in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started business with him in the fall of 1954 , " Anderson said , " and our routine spot checking of customers always brings a good word . The homeowner knows exactly what he 's going to get , thanks to that showroom , and Richheimer delivers it . He 's not the cheapest , but that certainly does n't seem to hurt his business . " Richheimer has a formula for prices . He makes no secret of his charges , which are materials plus labor plus 30 per cent for overhead and profit  --  the last averaging under 5 per cent . " If the customer asks , we tell him , " he says , " and sometimes we tell him anyhow . Like the paper work for those FHA mortgage loans . I have two girls and an accountant doing nothing else . We charge an extra one hundred dollars for this and tell the customer so . " I found an amazing lack of interest in competitive bids among Richheimer 's clientele . Maybe he did cost more , but they wanted him to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York City , even in Connecticut and in New Jersey , which he has to refuse . He is not unknown in Washington  --  in fact , Assistant Commissioner Roy F. Cooke , in charge of FHA 's Title I department , which insures short-term home-improvement loans , journeyed to Levittown for a firsthand view of Richheimer at work . The most sensitive , seesaw jobs in the business are held by Richheimer 's job superintendents , Bill Kearns and Bob Driscoll . Both men are on the road every day , keeping tabs on 150 workmen , some of them directly employed , others employed by subcontractors who work full time for Richheimer . " It 's not the workmen we 're concerned about , it 's the customers , " Kearns remarked . " The first day we appear you can sense the feeling that we 're suspect . The wife is sure we 're going to mess up the house and kids , and her husband is on the lookout for a gyp job . Two days later , if we 're in good form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in the car . " " Not always , " Driscoll said . " Sometimes you get off on the wrong foot . Like the other morning when we started a basement playroom . The owner had a fire in the kitchen , which we had nothing to do with , the night before . That upset him , but darned if one of our men , as soon as he arrived at the place , did n't go out to a grove of trees which were the man 's special pride and spike one of them to hang up our ANOTHER Jon BY RiCHHEIMER sign . 1 really got chewed out . " " You never know , " Kearns commented , " That doctor fellow who had us build a new stoop , for instance . He kept riding me , until I was actually sick . I got to the job one morning , and he wanted to know what was the matter . I told him my stomach hurt , I was so worried . And that night , when 1 eet home , the druggist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Richheimer 's men sometimes join him , donating their labor , in modernizing a kitchen or installing a bath for needy families . I heard about these jobs from the Rev. Donner Atwood , pastor of the Levittown Community Church , a ( Dutch ) Reformed congregation where Richheimer serves as a deacon . Richheimer 's comment is simply , " 1 do n't forget that hundred dollars , and what it meant to me ; so I pass it along sometimes . " Mr. Atwood is drawn into the Richheimer business every now and then , " Usually when Herbert has trouble with one of his men , " he told me . " He has a quick temper , but when things go wrong he wo n't act until he has put the problem in my lap . ' I know what to do with this man , acting on business principles , ' he 'll say . ' Now you tell me what I should do as a good Christian Underestimating is the cardinal sin for his salesmen . " We do n't like overcharges , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was n't asked for , at times . What the public does n't understand , however is the way an estimate that is too low riot only gets the contractor in trouble but usually the customer too . if the contractor goes under . the homeowner usually winds up with unfinished work and claims against him from supplierS and subcontractors who did n't get paid . Everybody loses . There 's one fellow I know . for instance , in an awful mess right now . His house had burned , and three or four of us bid on rebuilding it . We bid twenty-two thousand dollars . Others went as high as twenty-seven thousand . The low bidder , who quoted an impossible fourteen thousand , got the job . I could have told you what would happen . The contractor is broke , the house is half rebuilt , and the owner , if he ever finds the money , will be out thirty thousand dollars before he 's done . " His salesmen are likewise cautioned against overloading customers with debt , or selling improvements at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by the neighborhood . " Here 's a job I wo n't touch , " he explained , pulling out one of his salesman 's folders . " Our man ought to know better . " He handed me a photograph of the house . " It 's a seventhousand-dollar shack  --  and they want to spend eight thousand dollars on it . The value just is n't there , and wo n't be when the work is done . " In cases like this we often can find a solution for the family , " he added . " A fellow who makes only eighty-five dollars a week came in the other day . He had live kids in a tiny house and wanted us to doe **35;1160;TOOLONG , to add two bedrooms upstairs . Refinancing on a thirty-year mortgage would have put hint out on a limb . The safe rule is not to let monthly carrying charges exceed one week 's income . So we suggested he use double-decker bunks for his boys in one bedroom and add just a single room in his attic . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on a short-term note . " Richheimer 's men have to dig deep , at times , to deliver the proper job . " A housewife with a large family will come in and tell us she wants to enlarge the house and add a family room , " one of them told me , " and this will mean three or four thousand dollars . She may have a perfectly adequate living room , but the kids underfoot make it seem small . If there 's a basement , she can get a playroom at a fourth the cost of building an addition . " The husband who " has to have " a garage , and the wife who insists on a new kitchen , when what they really need is an extra bedroom and bath for her widowed mother , due to move in within six months , are an old story to the salesmen , who usually maneuver their customers into the most sensible expenditure . One salesman , a former engineer and draftsman , recently brought off a minor miracle through tact and persistence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his home nit cutting the cosi of the job in half . Richheimer 's architectural service ir not much concerned with design , produo ing plans mainly for the guidance of NI workmen and for submission to local governments to obtain building permits . " The changes in regulations from one community to another do n't always make sense . either , " he commented , " yet local codes are the only regulations that govern some home improvements . Many jabs do n't have to meet any requirements at wrong , " The like the all. ; 7ahned pthuabtliics minimum property requirements set up by FHA , which specify products and practices required if they are to insure mortgage for a new house . This also applies on our FHA refinancing , and I guar . antec it will quickly separate thc good from the bad among home-improvement con. tractors . This would help fight those gyps in our business , the quick-buck operators I call the blue-suede-shoe boys . State legislation , maybe licensing of people in our business , could help too . " Richheimer calls it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels he explored while Sep . ing as adviser to the Department of Commerce of New York State . He has also become interested in urban renewal , not in the big city , but in the older , run-down areas of the suburbs . " I am commencing to schtudy it , " he says . He " schtudied " the home-improvement business , night and day , for a full year before he took the plunge . There will be major changes in at least a few towns if Richheimer 's concentration on renewal gets anything like the same results .
