MAEBASHI , Japan , Tuesday , Nov. ** S. Girard was found guilty today in the fatal shooting of a Japanese woman , but a sentence of three years was suspended . Chief Judge Yuzo Kawachi characterized - the shooting of Mme , Naka Sakai , a 46-year-old farm wife and mother , as an act of " excessive mischief carried out for the sole purpose of gratifying a momentary caprice of the accused . " However , there were extenuating circumstances , said Judge Kawachi in handing- down the decision of the three-judge court . He said he did not " believe the 22-year-old soldier from Ottawa , Ill. , had fired at the woman with the intent of hitting her or causing injury . Faced ** Term The judge gave that as the reason for the relatively light sentence for Girard , an Army specialist third class . Under Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fifteen years ' imprisonment at hard labor . The prosecution had asked for a five-year sentence . Mme. Sakai was killed Jan. 30 on the Somagahara firing range while she was collecting expended shell cases to sell for scrap . She was struck by an expended cartridge case fired by Girard from a grenade launcher on his rifle . Judge Kawachi said the court " feels that the accused has adequately repented of his crime " and will not repeat it . After reading the formal sentence , the judge asked Girard if he understood . " Yes , sir , " the soldier said in a firm voice . " This is indeed a regrettable incident , " the judge said . " I hope you now will turn over a new leaf and stop taking such lighthearted actions . " Girard Must Pay Costs The court assessed the costs of the witnesses to Girard , which he must pay himself out of his Army pay . Judge Kawachi pointed out , however , that this was only a small part of the total cost of the trial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total Girard *lust pay probably will amount to less than $100 . Girard probably will be returned by the Army to the United States . His second regular enlistment expired Oct. 27 . He - had expressed the intention of re-enlisting if he was acquitted . The sentence , even though suspended , probably bars him from further Army service . Soldier Called Immature MAEBASHI , Tuesday , Nov. 19 UP ) ? The suspension provides that Girard  --  whom the court described as a simple soldier , immature in his thinking  --  must // show good behavior for four years as an aftermath of the case that strained United States-Japanese relations . However , the judge said that if Girard returned to the United States , his conduct there would not concern Japan . The decision permits the soldier to return to the United States if neither the defense nor the prosecution appeals within fourteen days . Either side may appeal a verdict in Japan . There were strong signs , however , that both were satisfied with the verdict in the shooting , which brought a crisis in United States-Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the United States Army , not Japan , should have tried Girard because he was performing military duties . The judge rejected Girard 's defense and accepted testimony of a fellow soldier , Specialist 3/c Victor N. Nickel of Inkster , Mich. , and Japanese witnesses that Giraard had exceeded his guard duties by enticing shell pickers with hand motions and shouts . Judge Kawachi scolded the trespassing Japanese metal scavengers . " They can not escape being shouldered with the burden of half the criticism , " he declared . " It is not appropriate to place the entire responsibility * * upon a simple soldier , the accused , immature as is his thinking . " The court also scolded the United States Army , saying officials " showed practically no concern " in disposing of the valuable scrap and allowed well-meaning officers and soldiers to give it freely to the Japanese trespassers . The judgment convicted Girard of " bodily injury resulting in death " ? manslaughter  --  under Article 205 , Paragraph 1 of the Japanese criminal code . The defense had asked either acquittal or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders to guard a machine gun . Girard , who had been accused of having enticed the shell scavengers toward him , had insisted in court the only thing he shouted was " Sayonara , " the Japanese word for good-by . But the court held , as testified by SSpecialistNickel. that he had shouted at Mme. Sakai , " Mamasan , daijobu . Takusan brass , ne " ( It 's all right , old woman , there 's lots of brass ) . Judge Kawachi asserted Girard had said these words pointing to a foxhole and thus had " made the woman understand that there was a large quantity of brass ( cartridges ) in the foxhole and that she could pick them up . Thereby , the accused made the woman approach the foxhole . The court noted that one rea1 son the suspended sentence was justified was that Army officials " have shown anxiety in the future of the bereaved family of Naka Sakai and have formulated measures of consoling the bereaved and have completed . preparations to give to the family a ' considerable sum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The . case flared into bitter controversy on both sides of the Pacific last summer . Japan claimed the right to try the soldier under the mutual security agreement with the United States . Japan has the right to try United States soldiers for crimes committed while not in performance of duty . United States authorities , in surrendering Specialist Girard to Japanese courts , decided he had exceeded his orders . The United States Supreme Court ruled that there was no constitutional bar to trial of the soldier by the Japanese . Haru Girard , the 28-year-old Japanese girl whom Specialist Girard married shortly before his trial started two and onehalf months ago , prayed for her husband before a candle-lit altar in her rented room at nearby Oizumi last night . The three judges began hearing evidence Aug. 26 . The court held fifteen session at intervals of about a week before it heard all the twelve Japanese and seven American witnesses .

Asked whether he would appeal the sentence , Girard replied : " For the moment I do n't know . " Army is Silent WASHINGTON , Nov. 18 ( R ) ? The Army was silent tonight about the verdict .
