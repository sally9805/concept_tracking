Clinton Locy was a cattle ranch foreman in Southern California when a Baptist preacher persuaded him to go to church . He heard one sermon and decided to be a preacher himself . Last week he gave a sermon that lasted 48 hours and 18 minutes . <P> Into the Night Wind . Ranch Foreman Locy first became Preacher Locy at the Holy Land Bible Knowledge Society in Los Angeles . Then he spent 30 years barnstorming the U.S. and Canada-the last 19 of them in a trailer-teaching the Bible with the help of pictures . When Clinton and his wife Georgia settled down a couple of years ago in West Richland , Wash . ( pop . 1,000 ) , they set about starting a Visual Bible Training Center . <P> They built it practically all with their own hands , a flat-topped building decked inside with maps of Palestine ; some day they hoped to add a second story for a real church . To mark the establishment of the training center , Locy felt something special was indicated . His thoughts flew back to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once preached for 24 hours straight ; Locy would preach 48 . His subject : every book in the Bible , plus the Atomic Age . <P> He went to bed at 3:30 on Saturday afternoon to rest up , but his mind churned so with thoughts that , when he began to preach at midnight , he had not slept a wink . About a dozen of his followers were on hand for his opening words : " Men are on earth to find truth and live it out . Truth is power . Without truth man dies . " Two loudspeakers atop the building picked up his words from a throat microphone and flung them into the night wind . <P> " I 'm Hungry . " Three listeners stuck it out until 4 a.m. , then left to go to work . At one point on Sunday morning , there were as many as 50 . Sometimes there was only one , Carl Heminger. whose specialty is showing colored slides at church gatherings . Preacher Locy preached as he never preached before , sustaining himself with lemon juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , relieving himself at the back of the building , and talking into the mike all the time . After 24 hours he got to the Book of Psalms , and Georgia brought him a plate of hot food from their trailer home next door . Spooning in some beans , Preacher Locy momentarily forgot what he was there for . " Say something there , boy , " said Apostle Heminger . " I 'm hungry , " said Preacher Locy . <P> At 12:19 on Monday . Clinton Locy called it quits . He had made his way through all the Old Testament and most of the New , sung some hymns , lectured on the Holy Land , and delivered some reflections on the atom bomb . " If anyone had sat through the entire sermon , " he said , " they would have heard as much Gospel as they 'd get in a year at church . "
