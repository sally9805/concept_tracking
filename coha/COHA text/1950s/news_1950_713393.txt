txt The telephone strike passed its sixth day yesterday in a gathering atmosphere of tension and bitterness . No settlement was in sight . These were the developments as the American Telephone and Telegraph Company reported local and long distance service throughout the nation as " excellent . " 1 . The company 's Long Lines Department further crystAllized its policy with regard to the union 's hit-and-run picket line strategy . Ii T. Killingsworth , vice president , sent letters to the department 's 23,500 employes , saying : " If it becomes necessary in maintaining this service to take steps to secure relief for the loyal employes who have remained faithful to their duty , the company will , of course , have to take suitable measures . " 2 . Division 10 of the Communications Workers of America , C. I. 0. , representing long distance operators , filed with the National Labor Relations Board charges of unfair labor practices by the company on behalf of .300 Workers , who said they had been locked out or discharged upon returning to work after the removal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking installation workers of the Western Electric Company , manufacturing arm of the Bell System , battled police for forty-five minutes in an unsuccessful effort to bar women operators from an exchange . All were arrested . 4 . Joseph Beirne , president of the union , accused A. T. &; T. of starting on a program of strikebreaking , and said he would present ' to the Senate Labor Committee evidence " clearly establishing a long-time anti-labor policy in the Bell System . " 5 . Two mediation sessions conducted here by the Federal Mediation ' and Conciliation Service between . Divisions 6 and . 18 of // the union and the Western Electric Company were unsuccessful in ending the strike . Federal mediators - reported both sides still deadlocked . Officials of the long lines depart : ment , whose offices in fourteen cities have been a major target of the Western Electric strikers , did not elaborate on their promise to offer " relief " to those workers who stayed on the job . But Mr. Beirne , speculating on the develop-1 ment , had this to say : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacements them all I can say is that hiring people and then training the m to act as strike ? breakers  --  and by this I mean getting them across picket lines and then teaching them to handle telephone calls and maintain the complicated telephone apparatus  --  may prove to be as big a bite for the company as its ambitious lockout program . " Threat of Lockout Denied Mr. Killingsworth 's letter to long lines employes had stressed that " this is not a threat of a lockout or of a penalty as has been charged ; it is the announcement of an operating policy that is inescapable and is essential to the furnishing of reliable service to the public . " S. Howard ** attorney for Division 10 , who brought the unfair labor practice charges , thought differently . " He said that 3,000 long lines operators had been ' locked out " in this city and that nationally the number was 20,000 . He charged that company supervisors had sought assurances from returning workers that they would continue on their jobs even though picket lines were formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might seek an injunction to prevent the company from following this procedure and attempt to recover pay for any time lost by operators . This would amount to $30,000 a day in New York and $150,000 a day for the nation , they estimated . The Philadelphia incident was the first evidence of major violence since the strike 's outbreak last Thursday . Twice an estimated 150 pickets broke through police lines to block entering non-strikers . In the melee hats were dropped to their knees and buttons were torn from the clothing of police and strikers alike . On the third try police opened a passageway for the returning operators and clerks . Service Reported Normal Spokesmen for the long lines department said service was normal throughout the day . Only three offices were being picketed by the union , according to the company . They were in Pittsburgh , Buffalo and Memphis . The company said that 1,000 operators were back in this city . A report persisted during the day that the Western Electric Company would make a new offer yesterday or today .. None was made yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he knew nothing about it . The rumor was traced to William Barry , a local official of Division 6 . Although other union officials professed ignorance of it , Mr. Barry did not alter his stand . For the first time since the strike began the main office of the A. T. &; T. at 195 Broadway was picketed . Picket lines were also formed for a few hours outside the New York Telephone Company Building at 140 West Street . Employes of the latter company are not on strike , do not belong to the union , and company service has not been affected . Court Action in 4 States The company went into court in four states and obtained restraining orders . In Mississippi the Southern Bell ? Telephone Company got a state-wide anti-picketing order . In Aberdeen , S. D. , pickets withdrew in the face of another temporary restraining order . In Minnesota a Federal judge restrained strikers from interferring with non-strikers , trains or motor vehicles leaving the Western Electric plant in Minneapolis . In Virginia picketing of the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states . The union will contest them all . Directly involved in the strike are 16,000 Western Electric employes . They are seeking higher wages . The company , is reported to have offered 11% cents an hour , and the union is said to want 15 cents . The length of contract is also an issue . n addition , another 17,000 employes of the Bell system in Michigan are engaged in a separate walkout of their own . At first ' the strikers sought to keep as many of their fellow union member employes by A. T. &; T. as possible away from their jobs by forming picket lines in fortythree states and the District of Columbia . Later it adopted its practice of hit-and-run pic/et lines to throw company off icials  --  off balance .
