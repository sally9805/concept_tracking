Two months ago . led by a young black strongman named Sekou Toure , Guinea became the only territory in French Africa to reject the constitution of Premier Charles de Gaulle . Last week Tour , threatened with the loss of all his economic ties with France , flew off to Ghana . Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah was at the Accra airport with bands , a 21-gun salute , and a cheering crowd bearing placards saying , WELCOME LABORMAN . . . LIBERATOR OF GUINEA ! Toure had made no secret of the fact that he wanted intimate ties with Ghana . But just how close those ties were to be came as a real surprise . <P> After only two days of discussion , Tour and Nkrumah issued a ringing communiqu : " Inspired by the example of the 13 American colonies , which on attainment of their independence constituted themselves into a confederacy which ultimately developed into the United States of America , " the two nations , though separated by the French Ivory Coast . would join in a United Republic . " As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag and to develop between our two governments the closest contacts . . . especially in the fields of defense and foreign and economic affairs . " <P> Next steps : to draw up a common constitution and to invite other African states ( mostly in French West Africa ) to join the union , too . As a dowry , Nkrumah promised Guinea a credit of 10 million . Both Prime Ministers agreed not to pass up any of the advantages their old colonial masters might still offer , with Ghana remaining in the British Commonwealth , and the republic of Guinea seeking ties with the new " French Community .
