txt In addressing the members of Congress yesterday General Ridgway gave a statesmanlike report of his period of service in the Far East . His manner was above reproach  --  one is inclined to say , beyond praise . He knew what he was talking about and talked about it plainly . The case was presented to the representatives of this people just about as well as it could be presented . At the present stage of " negotiation , " which , of course , is not negotiation at all , there is the utmost significance in General Ridgway 's summary of Communist propaganda charges . He sees in them a warning to us to be on our guard and to make the correct appraisal of our implacable adversary . This is more than a denial , of which we have made dozens , and more than a mere attempt once more to set the record straight . General Ridgway said : " In the whole black record of false propaganda these charges cshould stand out as a monumental warning to the American people and the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest fire bearing down upon a wooden village . The extent to which Communist leaders have gone in fabricating , disseminating and persistently pursuing these false charges should impress upon the brains of those who yet fail or refuse to see the purpose of communism the deadly danger with which it confronts us and the free world . " It is in this light that Admiral Joy 's valedictory to the " negotiation " should be read . Admiral Joy , like General Ridgway , has seen the deadly danger at first hand . He knows the " black " record of false propaganda from having been exposed to it . He is right , therefore , in excoriating its Communist authors as he bids them farewell . He , also , is emphasizing the danger . The danger , in this case , is that constant repetition of the Communist big lies will gain for them a degree of currency among the uninformed . Admiral Joy pointed out that the Communist tactic in agreeing to " negotiate " was a time saver . It was designed to get additional days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ridgway has repeatedly called attention . In recent weeks , however , it is also designed , by Communist admission , to serve solely to provide the sounding board for a daily blast of vicious falsehood . General Ridgway 's summary , however , goes far beyond this in its implications . He is talking not merely about the relatively restricted matter of discussion at Panmunjom . He is calling attention to what this reveals in the wider area of our long-range opposition to those who would enslave the free world . This is the " deadly danger . " What has been revealed is not merely a flagrant and often flippant dismissal of both truth and fact . It is also the use of the whole arsenal of fabrication , distortion , obstruction and deceit to prevent any possibility of an honest and honorable meeting of minds . The Communists can have a truce if they really want it , General Ridgway points out . That is true now , and it was true ten months ago . The sordid story of Communist discussion shows clearly that no such wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' obviously , was an early military advantage to be gained by a slowing of the pace of the United Nations attack . What is sought now is a later propaganda advantage from the opportunity to continue the stream of malignant lies in the hope that some innocents can become infected . General Ridgway was reporting on the Far East only . What he has to say has significant bearing on other conflicts with the Communists elsewhere . General Ridgway will be at or near the heart of some of those conflicts in his new assignment . The forest fire is bearing down on wooden villages in Europe no less than in Asia . The same mendacity , rapacity and utter soullessness can be expected in the future just as it has been experienced in the past . This plain talk from a good American is an indication that he is not deceived . It behooves us also not to delude ourselves with false hopes and wishful optimism . We are in a deadly struggle with a deadly antagonist . We have been well reminded of that fact and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do .
