In Mt . Dora , Fla. one day last week , someone drew a chalk line down the school sidewalk for all the pupils to see . One side was labeled " White People , " the other " Nigger Lovers . " Reason for the line : 65 of the pupils had just signed a special petition to TIME about the plight of the five children of Orange Picker Allan Platt ( TIME , Dec. 13 ) . Though the Platts had insisted that they are of Irish-Indian descent-and had documents to prove it-Mt . Dora 's Sheriff Willis McCall arbitrarily decided that they are Negroes , and ordered them out of the school . TIME 'S story had said that , except for Editor Mabel Norris Reese , no one seemed to care . The petitioners simply wanted " the world to know " that they did : <P> " We care . . . The Constitution says that a person is innocent until proved guilty . We feel that the Platt children have had a raw deal . Their right to an education has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . <P> " To be expelled for violation of Florida 's segregation law is one thing ; to be expelled because of an unfounded suspicion is another . <P> <P> " Therefore , we believe the Platt children should be permitted to remain in school until the sheriff can prove they do n't belong . " <P> In the incident of the chalk line , one child was stoned with pebbles . Two more decided next day that they had better withdraw from the petition " because it might hurt our daddy 's business . " And the Platt children ? At week 's end-despite their schoolmates ' gallant try-they were still barred from school .
