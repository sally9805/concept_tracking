it started nineteen years ago , when a few auto workers met secretly in a basement ; now it has become America 's biggest union ? and a welcome , responsible member of the community . A veteran labor reporter tells how the UAW got over its growing pains . fall I visited " Solidarity House , " the United Automobile Workers ' hand- some new headquarters in Detroit . On that particular clay , Emil Maze ' ' , the union 's secretary-treasurer , happened to be talking to a delegation from the government of Burma which included the mayor of Rangoon . " Mr. Mazey , " one of the Burmese asked , " can you tell us about your early days and the sit-down strikes ? " " Well , " Mazey replied , " nineteen years ago we began meeting secretly in a basement .. . . " Since those basement days the auto workers have become the largest union in America ? and so famous internationally that it takes a full-time executive to arrange programs for foreign visitors . The land on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his graystone mansion now houses the union 's health department . In that same period the UAW has traveled a long way from straight business track unionism of wages and hours , to a program that includes the whole community . I realized how dramatic that journey has been when I drove into Flint , the automobile town not far from Detroit . There I recognized the plant called Fisher 2 . In the winter of 1937 the late Ellen Wilkinson , a I.abor Member of Parliament , and I had been boosted through the window of that plant to speak to the sit-down strikers . The country was then on edge over the sitdown strikes ; Flint was under martial law . General Motors had refused to negotiate unless the workers first came out.of the plants . When they refused , there had been a cry from the newspapers , " Shoot them out . " As the clamor continued , Flint was terrified by an enormous demonstration of flying squadrons of auto workers from Detroit , Saginaw , Pontiac , Lansing , and even Cleveland , to protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In spite of threats and political pressure even from the White House , Governor Frank Murphy insisted that the strike could he settled without bloodshed . What made Flint unforgettable in the winter of 1937 was the spirit of the workers . Women left their homes to manage motor pools and soup kitchens . They spoke at meetings , walked on picket lines , and all the time they sang . They chased the police at what was called the Battle of Bull Run ? because the bulls ran away from the women . Each women 's auxiliary had a distinctive color for its tam ? Flint , red ; Detroit , green ; Saginaw , blue ; and when delegates from these auxiliaries swung down the streets of Flint together , everyone who saw them realized that " solidarity " was not just a word . Many different factors won that strike . There was Governor Murphy 's steadfastness and there was the negotiating genius of John L. Lewis , then president of the CIO . It was Roy Reuther who planned the strategy of the strike in Chevvy 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who helped to carry it out ; while Victor Reuther 's calm voice directed the strike action from the loudspeaker truck . But none of these things could have won without the courage of the anonymous workers . T HIS was seventeen years ago . What I found in Flint last fall among the union members was that same spirit transformed into today 's terms and problems . Now the union and the community work together instead of against each other . During the sit-down strikes , the police were anti-union . So was the community . City Manager Barringer organized the Flint Alliance , a strike-breaking , hack-to-work movement . On the last day of the negotiations , Pengally Hall , the strike headquarters , was tense with fear of a vigilante attack from the Alliance . " Now all the city officials are co-operating with us , " David MacDonald , then Assistant to Regional Director Robert Carter of Region 10 , told me last fall . " The Chief of Police , I 'll say without reservation , he helps us in everything . Most of the eighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago you would n't have expected a General Motors works manager to drop into a union headquarters to have a friendly chat about some community matter in which labor and management were both interested . We would n't have had a common meeting around . " 0 Presently we drove to Beecher Town'sliip where on June 8 , 1953 , a freak tornado razed over 300 houses , killed 116 people , and injured 600 during a half-hour of violence . No sooner was the tornado over than the UAW , along with the social agencies of Flint and the Red Gross , which spent altogether $900,000 on relief , moved into action . Within a day 's time , the UAW headquarters and locals had donated $100.000 to the Disaster Fund which cared for all victims , not only union members . David MacDonald was made its chairman . Weekends , members of the A F of L building trades repaired houses of the CIO auto workers free of charge . Then came Operation Tornado , probably the biggest building-bee in history . The idea came from Father Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlined his plan for a tremendous house-raising to Mayor Reigle . This complicated operation was planned to the last detail by local building contractors . The AF of L , Flint , Genesee County Buildings Council enlisted skilled workers from Lansing , Saginaw , Midland , Detroit , and even Battle Creek . The CIO Council assigned full-time workers . The Chamber of Commerce , churches , social agencies , all helped in recruiting 5,500 volunteers ? ministers , Chamber of Commerce members , executives , church people , schoolboys , women ? who worked under the direction of skilled AL .. of L building tradesmen . Loud-speakers were set up by local radio hams who called out what kind of workers were needed for a certain home . A tool-grinder set up his equipment in a field . All day long Boy Scouts scuttled through the crowd bringing tools supplied by building contractors to be sharpened . The Flint CIO Council which had been in the forefront recruiting workers gave $1,500 extra for accident insurance . Flint doctors and nurses stood by for first aid . Families signed up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , helped by the Disaster Fund . Most firms gave their materials at cost . Eighty thousand man-hours , valued at $160,000 , were donated . In two clays , on August 28 and 29 , 189 houses were finished or completely built . Crews of auto workers and building trades workers raced each other to put up houses ? many of them of brick and cement ? in a single day . Volunteers continued to finish houses in their spare time , until on October 10 and I I , a second Operation Tornado of 1,500 volunteers built eighteen more houses . I T WAS after Operation Tornado that the first Annual Educational Institute of the Greater Flint Industrial Union Council was held in the Flint Labor Temple . Panel discussions were held on Veterans and Rehabilitation , Children 's Services , Recreation , and the Aged . An afternoon was given to the topics of community giving and community planning . One panel had for its subject " Labor 's Responsibility in the Community . " Flint is- only one of the many towns throughout the country which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as part of the community . This change has not conic about by chance . Community Services are not only part of the UAW 's program but of the whole CIO 's . The dynamic power of the UAW comes from an idea which Walter Reuther is never tired of repeating . Its core is that " what is good for the community is good for the Auto Workers . " This identification with the country as a whole is the motor power of the UAW-CIO philosophy . What the Union Wants T HE UAW-CIO is a massive union ? young , individualistic , horn into factionalism and nurtured on contention . plagued in its early days by inner struggles and outlaw strikes , but always vital , growing , and reaching out to new goals . UAW stands for international Union United Automobile , Aircraft , and Agricultural Implement Workers of America , whose dues-paying members number 1,600,000 . Its net worth on July 30 , 1953 , was $18,167,499 . The UAW makes every automobile in the United States and the majority of agricultural implements ; aircraft manufacture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Machinists , with whom the UAW has a non-raiding and a mutual assistance pact . The union has added over 200,000 new members during the past two years in a drive on competitive and runaway shops . led by vice presidents Richard G. Gosser and John L. Livingstone . The drive was financed out of a dollar increase on the low union dues of $1.50 a month . As I listened to the organizers reporting in from the field I realized that despite the changes in Flint and elsewhere there are still some employers who fight unions as much as they ever did . The biennial convention is the legislative body of the union . Changes in the constitution or union dues are decided here , and the officials are elected : Between conventions , the union is run by the Executive Board , composed of the president , the secretary-treasurer , and two vice presidents , and the regional directors whose election is a lively matter . The UAW convention with its 2,000 delegates is something to see . In earlier days , when factional fights plagued the union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now any resolution that tends to center authority in the International is bitterlyfought from the floor . Individualistic to the point of pugnaciousness , suspicious of " pork choppers " ? paid officials ? the membership is noisy , vocal , uninhibited , irreverent . Walter Reuther , UAW president , brags , " Our union is built from the bottom up ? no other union has such a basic rank and file structure . " Reuther is at his best chairing this restless , untamed body . He gives it its head , plays it skillfully , calls a halt , cajoles it , brings it up short , never lets it get out of bounds ? but neither-he nor anyone else dominates it . The 1,124 locals are distributed among forty states and five Canadian provinces , located in 415 towns and cities . UAW contracts now number 2,400 . Written into these contracts are agreements which look toward abolishing the workers ' three major fears : unemployment , sickness , and old age . N THE UAW 's first days , many auto workers made exactly forty cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor stand-by pay ; there were no paid vacations or holidays ; and neither accident , medical , hospital , sickness , nor disability insurance . Today there are all these things . In the fall of 1945 the victorious 113-day General Motors strike related the wage scale to the cost of living . The principal that the increase in corporation profits resulting from increased productivity should be shared by the workers has now been accepted by such employers as General Motors ' C. E. Wilson . More than 1,000,000 auto workers are already covered by hospitalization and surgical programs for which the companies pay onehalf or more , while contracts cover 1,250,000 workers with sickness and accident benefits of from $28 to $45 a week for periods of thirteen to thirty-two weeks . This is only a beginning ; the UAW is determined to banish the economic hazards of accidents and sickness . A no-discrimination clause is written into every union contract . During the shameful Detroit race riots of 1943 , Negro and white workers continued to work side by side . In 1950 a milestone was reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro members , who were finally admitted to tournament play . The 104-day Chrysler strike . of 1949-1950 settled the question of funded old-age pensions throughout the industry . Retired workers can not only expect a larger pension than the current $137.50 they receive monthly , but through the varied social life provided by the union can feel that they still belong . The union 's next goal is guaranteed full employment . I heard concrete plans for this discussed at the stirring UAW Educational Conference in Chicago last April . Before the 2,500 delegates and 750 visitors , Walter Reuther stated in his opening speech that guaranteed full employment is " more than a matter of economic justice to the wage earner . It is a matter of economic necessity to our nation . " During the 1949-50 Chrysler strike Walter Reuther had a painful operation on his arm which had been shattered in the attempt on his life in 1948 . During negotiations I saw his face often turn white with pain , but he continued the discussions . His brother , Victor Reuther , then director of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The law enforcement agencies believe they know the gangster murderers , but the final evidence is lacking . The Man at the Top W ALTER REUTHER was born into a trade union family . His father , Valentine Reuther , was President of the Ohio Valley Trade and Labor Association in Wheeling , West Virginia , a dangerous position in 1907 . He spent much time on his sons ' education and taught them to think . Sunday was not only the day of prayer that their religious Lutheran mother wanted , it was also a day of discussion of social and labor problems . Walter left high school to go to work . He was fired from his first job for agitating against Sunday work . Somewhere during the crowded years he went on with his education at night in Wayne University , Detroit . The depression found him jobless , so he and Victor decided to work their way around the world . They helped smuggle anti-Nazis into Switzerland ; saw workers beaten by the SS when they visited their mother 's home in Germany ; spent months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan and India . They returned to play an important part in building the UAW . Walter early showed that he was a natural leader and speaker . He captured the public 's imagination in 1941 with the Reuther Plan , which urged using vacant space in automobile factories for the manufacture of airplanes ? and which was later acted on in part . Until he was elected president by a narrow marain in 1946 , the UAW was torn with fac-t- ) tional struggles between the Communistcontrolled opposition and the Reuther group . Since then the opposition has steadily dwindled and is now mostly concentrated in the big Ford Local 600 . In 1952 Reuther was elected president of the CIO in another hotly contested election . He strongly favors the CIO and the AF of L joining forces . New Look in Assembly Lines A NYONE who wants to understand the problems of the auto workers should see them at their machines . It was ten years since I had seen a production line when I went through part of the Jefferson Street Chrysler plant last fall . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - When I last saw cars made , there was an urgent , frantic pace . Now higher production is gained by better machines and shop procedures rather than by trying to make the men work faster , To check speed-ups , stewards and committeemen are trained in union time-study methods , while the union 's research department makes job analyses . I watched a chassis take- a leisurely ride , altering as it went until it became a finished Chrysler . In the machine shop a man lifts cylinder heads From the overhead trolley with tongs . The cylinder heads go into a machine called the automatic broach , tended by one man who watches the circular colored lights . If a tool gets blunt a light flashes and the machine stops of itself . It performs all the milling operations that formerly required seven men . Next to the broach is the transfer machine which performs seven automatic transfers ? reaming , tapping , drilling , etc . Each of these operations was formerly done on a separate machine , and required about fourteen men . Now there is but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my guide . " This plant is old-fashioned . You should see the De Sow plant and even that 's nothing compared to the Ford plant in Cleveland . That plant is all machines , it do n't need men . " Inexorably , a new industrial revolution is going on which will change the life of the nation . I asked if this is n't going to put people out of work and learned that thus far increasing production has absorbed the men . But Walter Reuther , looking ahead , has said : " The UAW is not a narrow pressure group trying to restrict technological change . Though we want to see the new technology , we insist that guarantees must be made that it does n't spell unemployment . " The incredible production being made in our industries concerns everyone in this country . Used for selfish purposes , we confront a nightmare where idle men walk the streets , made obsolete as producers , while the mechanical monsters ca n't replace them as consumers . Properly used , they can help to realize America 's age-long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NG on the edge of a disquieting future , I was recalled to the present by the whistle blowing for lunch . Quiet fell . The men took out their lunch buckets . A wagon with milk , coffee , and soft drinks was pushed around . As they did ten or twenty years ago , some of the men played cards , others checkers or dominoes . Lunch hour , at least , has n't changed . After lunch , I met a shop steward , and with him the union counselor , a comparative newcomer in the labor movement . A counselor has to be able to advise the workers about the many social services that are available to them ; to tell veterans what their rights are , and workers where they can get their social security problems straightened out ; to provide information about hospitals ; and so on . I asked this counselor what he had had to cope with recently . " There was a fellow today who was garnisheed by three different companies , " he said . " I told him about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fellow who did n't have the money to move . I got him a truck from our motor pool that we use mostly to take folks to clinics . " The shop steward ? who like the counselor is trained in special classes ? is the cornerstone of the I TAW . He does the day-todavbargaining , and it depends largely upon him whether or not the contract works smoothly . He is a trouble-shooter and negotiator . He must distinguish between false and real grievances , and keep a written record of all decisions . He must know the contract inside out , and see that it is kept , as well as the state and federal labor laws . All collective bargaining begins in the shop with individual gripes , and most of the grievances have to do with safety problems , working conditions , and production schedules . The union headquarters keep a detailed account of all grievances to see how many come under each heading ; together with general criticisms coming from local unions , these data form the basis for negotiating the next contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectiveness depends on its members ' level of understanding and their participation in union and civic affairs . This is how Roy Reuther , head of the UAW Political Action Committee , explained it to a regional summer school : " In our political round table , " he said , " we asked the delegates to state the various things they felt the union should do for the members . They mentioned guaranteed annual wage , a raised minimum wage and pensions , FEPC , better labor legislation on workmen 's compensation , and health and unemployment insurance . One said , ' Peace , too . ' " I asked them to take each of these things and see whether they can be gotten through collective bargaining alone . " Everyone agreed that guaranteed annual wage tied in with unemployment compensation , and that political action was necessary . If the farmers ' income goes down there will be unemployment in farm equipment ? again political action is needed . A wrong political decision affects the whole economy . " We impress on every group to which we speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group for ourselves alone . Our political program is like our Community Betterment Program . We make progress with the community . How we affect the whole community is shown in the fact that after the announcement of the Ford Pension Plan , within twentyfour hours Congress acted , and the old-age pension was increased for . all . Minimum wages , housing , schools , civic rights , expanded social security , a fair tax program are questions for the whole community ; so is our interest in international affairs . " 4 , DUCATING the members i ip ? especial l y the new membership ? is a most im- portant task . There will be a million new auto workers in the next five years , from expansion and replacement . And the union faces a paradoxical situation : the older men are usually the militants , while the young fellows who never had to fight for a union often prefer not to stir things up . " Our problem , " says Brendon Sexton , Director of Education , " is a question of communication , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Congress and state legislatures in terms of their interest . The press , TV , and radio give the employers ' point of view . We try to correct this by our means of communication ? education , our own press and radio and films . " The other part of our program is communicating our message to the community outside our union . " On the walls of his office is a poster which reads : " City workers buy farm products . Farm workers buy city products . Together they make America prosper . " Tents with speakers and UAW literature are often put up at county fairs . In Kentucky an injunction was served on them to leave . " You 're breeding discontent and stirring folks up saying factory workers are making $70 a week , " said the judge . " Is n't any worker should n't be satisfied with $35 . " There is a close link between the union 's Educational Department , research , public relations , and Political Action Committee . All four weave into Community Services headed by Andrew Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , " he told me . " The other day I even got a letter from a little boy who wanted me to get him a temporary father to take him fishing . We 're working on it . Meantime I took him to the ball game with my own kids . Just now I 'm working on a complicated adoption case . " The union has branched into many other fields . For example , a growing credit unionwith 400 branches has 300,000 members , $300,000,000 on deposit , and $15,000,000 on loan . The members have made $3,500,000 savings in interest . There is a small but brilliant staff in the Washington office which keeps the union informed about legislation . Throughout the union there is a sense of movement that comes from people thinking and talking together . Take the women 's meeting of the Detroit region where I was a guest . Here more than 125 delegates discussed the fact that women are discriminated against in the hiring office and often paid less than men for the same work . Tax laws , wage scales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do about it ? " What I want to know , " one woman said , " is why business men can deduct the cost of female entertainment and whisky on their tax returns , but I ca n't deduct the cost of a nursery school or a baby-sitter . " The Conference to Fight for Full Employment called in Washington in December of last year was a dramatic bid for nation-wide attention to our economic situation . A thousand delegates from Hudson Bay to the Rio Grande gathered to call for measures to check " The Readjustment , " and to map out a program for full employment . IN HIS conference speech , Walter Reuther outlined the fundamental philosophy of the UAW-CIO : " We believe that possibilities for human progress and human betterment are almost unlimited . Science and technology have given us the tools with which to conquer poverty , hunger , ignorance , and disease . " The spiritual motivation of the labor movement is fundamentally trying to build a better world ... jobs , full employment , peace , that is what the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems of the working people without helping to solve the problems of the whole community and the whole nation . " As he spoke in the ballroom of one of Washington 's large hotels , it was a little hard ? to realize that this was the same organization that had held its first clandestine meetings in a Detroit basement ? less than two decades ago . I would never have dared predict then that a union could grow up quite so fast .
