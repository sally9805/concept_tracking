and by no means unknown admirer , I want you to have a good time and go away from here saying , Archie Goodwin can be trusted . He had us at his mercy , but he gave us a chance to say yes or no : " " Yes ! " Blanche Duke called . " Thank you . " I inclined my head . " I was about to ask , how many feel like eating salad ? If you want it , Fritz will enjoy serving it . But what if you do n't ? Yes or no ? " There were six or seven noes . " Do you still say yes , Miss Duke ? " " My God , no . I did n't know you meant salad . " " Then we 'll skip it . However , I wo n't ask for a vote on the almond parfait . You should taste it , at least . " I turned to Fritz , at my elbow . " That 's how it is , Fritz . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his duckling , one of his best dishes . I wasted no sympathy on him because I had warned him . I have had much more opportunity than he has to learn the eating habits of American females . At an affair of the Society of Gourmets that duckling would have drawn cheers . Their reaction to the almond parfait made up for it some . In their relaxed condition they were more or less ignoring the code , and a couple of them took spoonfuls while Fritz was still serving . Portia Liss exclaimed , " Oh ! It 's absolutely heavenly ! Is n't it , Mrs. Adams ? " " I ca n't say , Portia . I have n't any . " But a few minutes later she conceded grudgingly , " It 's remarkable . Quite remarkable . " Others had extravagant comments . Helen Troy finished first . She arose and shoved her chair back and put her palms on the table to lean on . Her pimples were purple now instead of pink.  | " Oyeth , oyeth , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am . This is my maiden effort . " Someone tittered . " My maiden effort , " she insisted , " at my age . I 've been thinking what we can do for Mr. Goodwin and I 'm standing up to put it in the form of a motion . I move that one of us goes and puts her arms around Mr. Goodwin 's neck and kisses him and calls him Archie . " " Which one ? " Mabel Moore demanded . " We 'll vote on it . I nominate me . I 'm already up . " There were cries of dissent . Claire Burkhardt , at Helen Troy 's left , got her elbow and pulled her back onto her chair . Nominations were made . Someone suggested they should draw lots . Half an hour earlier I would have let it slide , on the chance that Sue or Eleanor would get elected , which would have been a pleasant experience , but at this stage I did n't want to risk having a tone set that it might be hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you think you ought to consult me ? " " Do n't butt in , " Blanche Duke said rudely . " I 'm sorry , but I have to . This is dangerous . If a certain one of you came close to me right now and put her arms around me and kissed me , I might be able to remember I 'm your host and I might not . Whereas  --  " " Which one ? " voices demanded . I ignored them . " Whereas if any other one did it , I could n't keep from showing my disappointment . You ca n't expect me to tell you her name . We 'll forget it . Anyhow , nobody seconded the motion , so it would be illegal . " I pulled at my right ear . " Another thing , the motion was put wrong . Doing it that way , who would it please most ?  |p72Not  me . You . I would much rather kiss than be kissed . But do n't misunderstand me , you 're my guests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I 'd love to please you . If you have a suggestion ? " Sue Dondero came through fine . " I have two . " " Good . One at a time . " " First , let all of us call you Archie . " " Easy . If I may call you Charlotte and Blanche and Dolly and Mabel and Portia and Eleanor and Claire and Nina and Helen and Sue . " " Of course . Second , you 're a detective . Tell us something about being a detective  --  something exciting . " " Well . " I hesitated and looked around , left and right . " Maybe I should treat it like the salad . Yes or no ? " I was n't sure all of them said yes , but plenty of them did . Fritz had the coffee cups in place and was pouring . I edged my chair back a little , crossed my legs , and worked my lips , considering . " I 'll tell you , " I said finally , " what I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case that was finished long ago , but it might be more interesting if I pick one that we 're working on right now . I can skip the parts that we 're keep- ! ing to ourselves , if any . Do you like that idea ? " They said they did . Except Mrs. Adams , whose lips had suddenly become a thin line , and Dolly Harriton , whose smart gray eyes might have been a little disconcerting if she had been closer . I made it casual . " I 'll have to hit only the high spots or it will take all night . It 's a murder case . Three people have been murdered : a man named Leonard Dykes , who worked in the office where you are , a girl named Joanp73Wellman , an editor in a publishing firm , and a girl named Rachel Abrams , a public stenographer and typist . " There were murmurings , and looks were exchanged . Nina Perlman said emphatically , in a soft satin voice that five or six Manhattans had had no effect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three murders by one person ? " Eleanor Gruber asked . " I 'll come to that . Our first connection with it , not much of one , a cop came and showed us a list of fifteen men 's names which had been written on a piece of paper by Leonard Dykes . They had found it between the pages of a book in Dykes 's room . Mr. Wolfe and I were n't much interestedand barely glanced at it . Then  --  " " Why did the cop show you the list ? " Dolly Harriton put in . " Because they had n't found any men to fit any of the names , and he thought we might have a suggestion . We did n't . Then , six weeks later , a man named John R. Wellmancalled and wanted us to investigate the death of his daughter , whose body had been found in Van Cortlandt Park  --  run over by a car . He thought she had been murdered , not killed by accident . He told us all about it , and showed us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written home . In it she said she had had a phone call from a man who gave his name as Baird Archer , author of a novel which he had submitted to Joan 's firm some months back . " " Oh , my God , " Blanche Duke said morosely . " Baird Archer again . " " I do n't want to bore you , " I declared . Most of them said I was n't . " Okay . Joan had read Archer 's novel and rejected it withp74a letter signed by her . On the phone he offered to pay her twenty dollars an hour to discuss his novel with him and tell him how to improve it , and she made a date to meet him the next day after office hours . So she said in her letter home . It was the evening of the next day that she was killed . " I reached for my coffee cup , drank some , and leaned back . " Now hold on to your hats . It had been six weeks since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had just glanced at it . But when Mr. Wolfe and I saw Joan 's letter home we immediately recognized the name of Baird Archer as one of those on Dykes 's list . That proved there was some kind of connection between Leonard Dykes and Joan Wellman , and since they had both died suddenlyand violently , and Joan had a date with Archer the day she died , it made it likely that their deaths were connected too , and connected with Archer . When you asked for something exciting about being a detective , if you meant something like tailing a murderer in Central Park and getting shot at , okay , that has its attractions , but it 's not half as exciting as our spotting that name . If we had n't , there would be one cop working on Dykes 's death in his spare time , and another one in the Bronx likewiseon Joan Wellman , instead of the way it is , which you know something about . That 's what I call exciting . " It did n't seem essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name . If Wolfe had been there he would have told it his way , but he was n't , and I was . Glancing around to see that coffee refills were being attended to and that cigarettes and matches were at hand for everyone , I resumed . " Next I 'm going to spill something . If it gets printed thep7575cops wo n't like it , and they sure wo n't like me , but they do n't anyhow . A girl named Rachel Abrams was a public stenographer and typist with a little one-room office on the seventh floor of a building up on Broadway . Day beforeyesterday she went out the window and smashed to death on the sidewalk . More excitement for me as a detective , which is what I 'm supposed to be talking about . It would probably have been called suicide or an accident if I had n't happened to walk into her office two or three minutes after she had gone out the window . In a drawer of her desk I found a little brown book in which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under receipts there were two entries showing that last September she had been paid ninety-eight dollars and forty cents by a man named Baird Archer . " " Ah , " Dolly Harriton said . There were other reactions . " I 'll be dreaming about Baird Archer , " Nina Perlman muttered . " I am already , " I told her . " As you can see , here 's a job for a detective if there ever was one . I wo n't try to tell you how the cops are going at it , of course one or more of them has talked with all of you the past two days , but here 's how we see it , and how we 'll go on seeing it unless somethingshows we 're wrong . We believe that Dykes 's death was somehow connected with the manuscript of that novel . We believe that Joan Wellman was killed because she had read that manuscript . We believe that Rachel Abrams was killed because she had typed that manuscript . So naturally we want Baird Archer , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or both , or we 're licked . Any suggestions ? " " Good lord , " Sue Dondero said.  | " Get a copy of the novel , " Portia Liss offered . Someone snickered . " Look , " I said impulsively , " unless you object I 'm going to do something . There are a couple of people connected ' with this case upstairs now , waiting to see Mr. Wolfe . I think it would be interesting if they came down and told you about it . " I pressed the floor button with my toe . " Unlessyou 've had enough ? " " Who are they ? " Mrs. Adams wanted to know . " The father of Joan Wellman and the mother of Rachel Abrams . " " It wo n't be very gay , " Dolly Harriton commented . " No , it wo n't . Things and people mixed up with detectivesare seldom gay . " " I want to see ' em , " Helen Troy said loudly . " It 's human nature . " Fritz had entered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abrams and Mr. Wellman , Fritz ? In the south room ? " " Yes , sir . " " Will you please ask them to be good enough to come down here ? " " Yes , sir . " He went . I inquired about drinks and got three orders.  |p77Blanche  Duke darned near ruined it . When Wellman and Mrs. Abrams were ushered in by Fritz , ten pairs of eyes were focused on them , though in two or three cases the focusing required a little effort . I arose , performed the introductions , and brought them to the two chairs I had placed , one on either side of me . Mrs. Abrams , in a black silk dress or maybe rayon , was tightlippedand scared but dignified . Wellman , in the same gray suit or its twin , was trying to take in all their faces without seeming to . He sat straight , not touching the back of the chair . I had my mouth open to speak when Blanche beat me to it . " You folks need a drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Wellman said politely . Mrs. Abrams shook her head . " Now listen , " Blanche insisted , " you 're in trouble . I 've been in trouble all my life , and I know . Have a drink . Two jiggers of dry gin , one jigger of dry vermouth  --  " " Be quiet , Blanche , " Mrs. Adams snapped . " Go to hell , " Blanche snapped back . " This is social . You ca n't get Corrigan to fire me , either , you old papoose . " I would have liked to toss her out a window . I cut in . " Did I mix that right , Blanche , or did n't I ? " " Sure you did . " " Call me Archie . " " Sure you did , Archie. "  | " Okay , and I 'm doing this right too . I do everything right . Would I let Mrs. Abrams and Mr. Wellman go withoutdrinks if they wanted them ? " " Certainly not . " " Then that settles it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abrams that Wellman would be called on first . " Mr. Wellman , I 've been telling these ladies about the case that Mr. Wolfe and I are working on , and they 're interested , partly because they work in the office where LeonardDykes worked . I told them you and Mrs. Abrams were upstairs waiting to see Mr. Wolfe , and I thought you might be willing to tell them something about your daughter Joan . I hope you do n't mind ? " " I do n't mind . " " How old was Joan ? " " She was twenty-six . Her birthday was November nine-teenth . " " Was she your only child ? " " Yes , the only one . " " Was she a good daughter ? " " She was the best daughter a man ever had . " There was an astonishing interruption  --  at least , astonishingto me . It was Mrs. Abrams ' voice , not loud but clear . " She was no better than my Rachel . " Wellman smiled . I had n't seen him smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a talk . We 've been comparing notes . It 's all right , we wo n't fight about it . Her Rachel was a good daughter too . " " No , there 's nothing to fight about . What was Joan going to do , get married or go on with her career , or what ? " He was still a moment . " Well , I do n't know about that . I told you she graduated from Smith College with honors. "  | " Yes . " " There was a young fellow from Dartmouth we thought maybe she was going to hitch up with , but she was too young and had sense enough to know it . Here in New York  --  she was here working for those publishers nearly four years  --  she wrote us back in Peoria about differ-ent  --  " " Where 's Peoria ? " Blanche Duke demanded . He frowned at her . " Peoria ? That 's a city out in Illinois . She wrote us about different fellows she met , but it did n't sound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to thinking it was about time , anyway her mother did , but she thought she had a big future with those publishers . She was getting eighty dollars a week , pretty good for a girl of twentysix , and Scholl told me just last August when I was here on a trip that they expected a great deal of her . I was thinking of that yesterday afternoon . I was thinking that we expected a great deal of her too , her mother and me , but that we had already had a great deal . " He ducked his head forward to glance at Mrs. Abrams and came back to me . " Mrs. Abrams and I were talking about that upstairs . We feel the same way about it , only with her it 's only been two days , and she has n't had so long to think it over . I was telling her that if you gave me a pad of paper and a pencil and asked me to put down all the different things I can remember about Joan , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than that  --  things she did and things she said , times she was like this and times she was like that . You have n't got a daughter . " " No . You have much to remember . " " Yes , I have . What got me to thinking like that , I wasp80wondering if I deserved what happened because I was too proud of her . But I was n't . I thought about it this way , I thought there had been lots of times she did somethingwrong , like when she was little and told lies , and even after she grew up she did things I did n't approve of , but I asked myself , can I point to a single thing she ever did and honestly say I wish she had n't done that ? And I could n't . " His eyes left me and went to my guests . He took his time , apparently looking for something in each face . " I could n't do it , " he said firmly . " So she was perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sneer , but it enraged Blanche Duke . She blazed at Claire . " Will you kindly get lost , you night-school wonder ? The man 's in trouble ! His daughter 's dead ! Did you graduatefrom college with honors ? " " I never went to night school , " Claire said indignantly . " I went to Oliphant Business Academy ! " " I did n't say she was perfect , " Wellman protested . " She did quite a few things I did n't think were right when she did them . All I was trying to tell you ladies , she 's dead now and it 's different . I would n't change a thing about her if I could , not one single thing . Look at you here now , all this drinking  --  if your fathers were here or if they knew about it , would they like it ? But if you got killed tonight and they had to take you home and have you buried , after they had had time to think it over , do you suppose they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Certainly not ! They 'd remember how wonderful you 'd been , that 's all , they 'd remember all the things you had done to be proud of ! "  |p81He  ducked his head . " Would n't they , Mrs. Abrams ? Is n't that how you feel about your Rachel ? " Mrs. Abrams lifted her chin . She spoke not to Wellman but to the gathering . " How I feel about my Rachel . " She shook her head . " It 's been only two days . I will be honest with you ladies . While Mr. Wellman was talking I was sitting here thinking . My Rachel never took a drink . If I had ever seen her take a drink I would have called her a bad daughter in strong words . I would have been so angry it would have been terrible . But if it could be that she was here now , sitting at that table with you , and she was drinking more than any of you , so that she was so drunk she would look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , Drink , Rachel ! Drink , drink , drink ! ' " She made a little gesture . " I want to be honest , but maybe I 'm not saying it right . Maybe you do n't know what I mean . " " We know what you mean , " Eleanor Gruber muttered . " I mean only I want my Rachel . I 'm not like Mr. Wellman . I have two more daughters . My Deborah is sixteen and she is smart in high school . My Nancy is twenty and she goes to college , like Mr. Wellman 's Joan . They are both smarter than Rachel and they are more fashionable . Rachel did not make eighty dollars every week like Joan , with office rent to pay and other things , but she did good all the time and once she made one hundred and twelve dollars in one week , only she worked nights too . But you ladies must not think I put her nose down on it . Some of our friends thought that , but they were wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deborah are smart , and she made Nancy go to college . If she got some dollars ahead I would say , Buy yourself a pretty dress or take ap82little trip , ' and she would laugh and say , I 'm a working girl , Mamma . ' She called me Mamma , but Nancy and Deborah call me Mom , and that 's the whole difference right there . " She gestured again . " You know she is only dead two days ? " It sounded rhetorical , but she insisted , " You know that ? " There were murmurings . " Yes , we know . " " So I do n't know how it will be when it is longer , like Mr. Wellman . He has thought about it a long time and he is spending money for Mr. Wolfe to find the man that killed his Joan . If I had money like him maybe I would spend it that way too , but I do n't know . All I think about now is my Rachel . I try to see why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did her work good and got paid for it the regular rates . She never hurt anybody . She never made any trouble . Now Mr. Goodwin tells me a man asked her to do work for him , and she did it good , and he paid her the regular rates , and then after some time goes by he comes back and kills her . I try to see why that happened , and I ca n't . I do n't care how much explaining I get , I do n't think I can ever see why any man had to kill my Rachel , because I know so well about her . I know there 's not a man or woman anywhere that could stand up and say , Rachel Abrams did a bad thing to me . ' You ladies know how hard that is , to be the kind of woman so that nobody can say that . I 'm not that kind of woman . " She paused . She tightened her lips , and then released them to say , " I did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to quiver . " Excuse me , please . " She faltered , arose , and made for the door . John R. Wellman forgot his manners . Without a word ,  |p83he  popped up , circled behind my chair , and followed Mrs. Abrams . His voice came from the hall , and then silence . The guests were silent too . " There 's more coffee , " I told them . " Anybody want some ? " No takers . I spoke . " One thing Mrs. Abrams said was n't strictly accurate . She said I told her that the man who paid Rachel for typing the script came back and killed her . What I told her was that Rachel was killed because she had typed the script , but not that it was the man who had paid her for typing it . " Three of them were dabbing at their eyes with their handkerchiefs . Two others should have been . " You do n't know that , " Dolly Harriton challenged . " To prove it , no . But we like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Troy asserted . " Yeah ? Why ? " " You said the death of Leonard Dykes was connected with these two . Did you mean the same man killed all of them ? " " I did n't say so , but I would for a nickel . That 's what I think . " " Then you 're crazy . Why should Con O'Malley kill those girls ? He did n't  --  " " Be quiet , Helen , " Mrs. Adams said sharply . She ignored it . " He did n't kill  --  " " Helen , be quiet ! You 're drunk . " " I am not drunk ! I was , but I 'm not now . How could anybody be drunk after listening to those two ? " To me : " Con O'Malley did n't kill Leonard Dykes on account of any manuscript . He killed him because it was Dykes that got him disbarred . Everybody  --  " She was drowned out . Half of them spoke and the otherp84half shouted . It may have been partly to relieve the feelingsthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there was more to it than that . Both Mrs. Adams and Dolly Harriton tried to shut them up , but nothing doing . Looking and listening , I caught enough scraps to gather that a long-standing feud had blazed into battle . As near as I could make out , Helen Troy , Nina Perlman , and Blanche Duke were arrayed against Portia Liss , Eleanor Gruber , and Mabel Moore , with Sue Dondero interested but not committed , and Claire Burkhardt , the night-school wonder , not qualified for combat . Mrs. Adams and Dolly Harriton were outside . In one of those moments of comparative calm that even the hottest fracas will have , Blanche Duke tossed a grenade at Eleanor Gruber . " What were you wearing when O'Malleytold you ? Pajamas ? " That shocked them into silence , and Mrs. Adams took advantage of it . " This is disgraceful , " she declared . " You ought to be ashamed of yourselves . Blanche , apologize to Eleanor . " " For what ? " Blanche demanded . " She wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . " We should all apologize to you , Mr. Goodwin . " " I do n't think so , " Dolly Harriton said dryly . " Since Mr. Goodwin staged this , I must admit cleverly and effectively , I hardly believe he has an apology coming . Congratulations , Mr. Goodwin . " " I must decline them , Miss Harriton . I have n't congratulationscoming either . " " I do n't care , " Eleanor insisted to me , " what you have coming . I 'm going to say this . After what Blanche said top85me . And what you must have heard before . Do you know who Conroy O'Malley is ? " " Sure . I 've been allowed to have a look at the police file on Leonard Dykes . A former member of the firm who got disbarred about a year ago . " She nodded . " He was the senior member . The name of the firm was O'Malley , Corrigan and Phelps . I was his secretary . Now I am Louis Kustin 's secretary . Must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my relations with Mr. O'Malley , that that was pure malice ? " " There 's no must about it , Miss Gruber . Say it if you want to , or just skip it . " " I do say it . It 's too bad , because really I like Blanche , and she likes me . This was starting to die down , and then the police came back and stirred it up again , and now you say it was something you told them about these two girls being killed that made them come back . I 'm not blaming you , but I wish you had n't , because  --  well , you saw what happened here just now . Could you hear what we said ? " " Some . " " Anyway , you heard Helen say that Conroy O'Malley killed Dykes because Dykes got him disbarred . That is n't true . O'Malley was disbarred for bribing a foreman of a jury in a civil suit . I do n't know who it was that informed the court , that never came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course it made a lot of talk in the office , all kinds of wild talk  --  that Louis Kustin had done the informing because O'Malley did n't like him and would n't make him a member of the firm , and that  --  " " Is this wise , Eleanor ? " Dolly Harriton asked coldly.  | " I think so , " Eleanor said , not fazed . " He ought to understand . " She went on to me. "  --  and that others had done it , Mr. Corrigan and Mr. Briggs among them , for similar reasons , and that Leonard Dykes had done it becauseO'Malley was going to fire him . I would n't even be surprised if there was talk that I had done it , I suppose because he would n't buy me some new pajamas . As the months went by there was n't so much of it , and then Leonard Dykes got killed and it started up again . I do n't know who began it that O'Malley had killed Dykes because he found out that Dykes had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was worse than ever . Just a lot of wild talk . No one really knew anything . You heard Blanche ask me if I was wearing pajamas when O'Malley told me something . " She seemed to think she had asked a question , so I grunted an affirmative . " Well , what he told me , just a few weeks ago , was that he had heard that it was the jury foreman 's wife who had written the anonymous letter to the judge telling about the bribing . It is n't likely that I was wearing pajamas , because I do n't wear them in the office , and it was in the office that he told me  --  of course he 's no longer connected with the firm , but he comes there once in a while . The talk that O'Malley killed Dykes is simply ridiculous . " " Why do n't you say what you think ? " Helen Troy demanded . " You think Uncle Fred killed Dykes . Why do n't you say so ? " " I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do . " " I do , " Blanche Duke stated , still ready to tangle . " Who is Uncle Fred ? " I asked  |p87Helen  answered . " He 's my uncle , Frederick Briggs . They do n't like him . They think he informed on O'Malley because he would n't make him a partner , and Dykes found out about it and threatened to tell O'Malley , and Uncle Fred killed Dykes to keep him from telling . You know perfectly well you think that , Eleanor . " " I do , " Blanche repeated . " You girls work in a law office , " Dolly Harriton said warningly , " and you should realize that gabbing in the women 's room is one thing , and talking like this to Mr. Goodwin is quite another . Did n't you ever hear of slan-der ? " " I 'm not slandering anyone , " Eleanor declared , and she was n't . She looked at me . " The reason I tell you all this , I think you 've wasted a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wellman , and you 're investigatingthe death of his daughter , and you went to all this trouble and expense because you think there was a connectionbetween her and Leonard Dykes . That list of names he wrote that was found in his room  --  what if some friend was there one evening and said he was trying to choose a name to use on something he had written , and Dykes and the friend made up some names and Dykes wrote them down ? There are a dozen ways it could have happened . And from what you say , that name Baird Archer is absolutely the only thing that connects Dykes with Joan Wellman and Rachel Abrams . " " No , " I contradicted her . " There 's another . They were all three murdered . " " There are three hundred homicides in New York every year . " Eleanor shook her head . " I 'm just trying to put you straight . You got us all worked up , or Mrs. Abrams and Mr.p88Wellman did , and from that row we had you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's why I told you all that . We all hope you find the man that killed those girls , I know I do , but I do n't think you 'll ever do it this way . " " Look , " Nina Perlman said , " I 've got an idea . Let 's all chip in and hire him to find out who informed on O'Malley and who killed Dykes . Then we 'd know . " " Nonsense ! " Mrs. Adams snapped . Portia Liss objected . " I 'd rather hire him to catch the man that killed the girls . " " That 's no good , " Blanche told her . " Wellman has alreadyhired him for that . " " How much do you charge ? " Nina asked . She got no reply , not that I resented it , but because I was busy . I had left my chair and gone to the side table , where there was a large celadon bowl , and , getting a couple of sheets from my pocket notebook and tearing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asking what I was doing , got no reply either until I had finished writing , put the pieces of paper in the bowl , and , carrying the bowl , returned to the table and stood behind Mrs. Adams . " Speech , " I announced . Helen Troy did not say oyez . " I admit , " I said , " that I have ruined the party , and I offer my regrets . If you think that I am rudely sending you home I regret that too , but it must be faced that I have doused all hope of continued revelry . I do offer a little consolation , with the permission of Mr. Wolfe . For a period of one year from date each of you will be sent upon requestthree orchids each month . You may request threep89at one time or separately , as you prefer . Specifications of color will be met as far as possible . " There were appropriate noises and expressions . Claire Burkhardt wanted to know , " Can we come and pick them out ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Earlier , " I went on , " it was suggested that one of you be chosen to demonstrate on my person your appreciation for this occasion . Maybe you no longer feel like it , but if you do I have a proposal . In this bowl are ten pieces of paper , and on each piece I have written one of your names . I will ask Mrs. Adams to take one of the pieces from the bowl , and the one whose name is drawn will accompany me forthwith to the Bobolink , where we will dance and dally until one of us gets tired . I do n't tire easily . " " If my name is in there you will please remove it , " Mrs. Adams ultimatumed . " If it 's drawn , " I told her , " you can draw another . Does anyone else wish to be excused ? " Portia Liss said , " I promised to be home by midnight . " " Simple . Get tired at eleven-thirty . " I held the bowl above the level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , please ? " She did n't like doing it , but it was a quick and easy way of getting the party over and done with , so after a second 's hesitation she reached up over the rim of the bowl , withdrewa slip , and put it on the table . Mabel Moore , at her left , called out , " Sue ! " I removed the other slips and , stuck them in a pocket . Sue Dondero protested , " My lord , I ca n't go to the Bobolink in these clothes ! "  | " It does n't have to be the Bobolink , " I assured her . " I guess you 're stuck , unless you want us to draw again . " " What for ? " Blanche snorted . " What do you bet they did n't all say Sue ? " I did n't dignify it with a denial . I merely took nine slips from my right-hand pocket and tossed them on the table . Later on in the evening there might be occasion to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken from the bowl.  |p91Ordinarily  Fritz takes Wolfe 's breakfast tray up to him at eight o'clock , but that Thursday he phoned down to say he wanted to see me before he went up to the plant rooms at nine , and I thought I might as well save Fritz a trip . So at 8:05 , having catered , I pulled a chair around and sat . Sometimes Wolfe breakfasted in bed and sometimes at the table by the window . That morning the sun was shining in and he was at the table . Looking at the vast expanse of yellow pajamas in the bright sun made me blink . He never says a word if he can help it until his orange juice is down , and he will not gulp orange juice , so I gave a fair imitation of sitting patiently . Finally he put the empty glass down , cleared his throat explosively , and started spreading the half-melted butter on a hot griddle cake . He spoke . " What time did you get home ? " " Two-twenty-four . " " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a night club . She 's the one . The wedding is set for Sunday . Her folks are in Brazil , and there 's no one to give her away , so you 'll have to give me away . " " Pfui . " He took a bite of buttered griddle cake and ham . " What happened ? " " Outline or blow by blow ? " " Outline . We 'll fill in later . " " Ten came , including a female lawyer , young and hand/some but tough , and an old warhorse . They drank upstairs and wrecked only two Oncidiums . By the  --  " " Forbesi ? " " No . Varicosum . By the time we descended they were genial . I sat at your place . I had warned Fritz that the soup and patties would fill them up and they would snoot the duckling , and they did . I made speeches , which were well received , but no mention of murder until coffee , when I was asked to tell them about detective work , as arranged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At an appropriatemoment I sent for our client and Mrs. Abrams , and if you had been there you would have been stirred , though of course you would n't admit it . They admitted it by wiping their eyes . By the way , Wellman had a nerve to suspect me of going too far too fast . He never met Mrs. Abrams until last evening , and he took her home . Oh , yes , I told them about finding Baird Archer 's name in Rachel Abrams ' account book , because I had to tie her in to clear the track for Mrs. Abrams . If it gets printed Cramer will yap , but it was me that found the book , and he admits I talk too much . " " So do I. " Wolfe took a sip of steaming black coffee . " You say they were stirred ? " " Yes . Their valves opened . But all they did was start a free-for-all about who informed on O'Malley , the former senior partner , and got him disbarred for bribing a jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assorted theories , but if they have any evidence worth buying they 're saving it . One named Eleanor Gruber , who is a looker but too busy being clever  --  she was O'Malley 's secretary and is now Louis Kustin 's  --  she undertook to straighten me out . She hates to see us waste our time try/ing to clinch a link between Dykes and Joan and Rachel , because there is n't any . Nobody contradicted her . I decided to adjourn and try one at a time , having been introduced , selected one named Sue Dondero , Emmett Phelps 's secretary , and took her to a night club and spent thirty-four of our client 's dollars . The immediate objective was to get on a satisfactory personal basis , but I found an opportunity to let her know that we intend , if necessary , to blow the firm of Corrigan , Phelps , Kustin and Briggs into so many little pieces that the Department of Sanitationwill have us up for cluttering the streets . As I said , the wedding is Sunday . I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It all depends . If one or more of them has really got a finger caught , either a firm member or an employee , I may have made a start at least . If not , Miss Gruber is not only shapely but sensible , and I may ditch Sue for her . Time will tell , unless you want to tell me now . " Wolfe had finished with the ham , and the eggs done with black butter and sherry , and was starting the windup , a griddle cake with no butter but plenty of thyme honey . In the office he would have been scowling , but he would not allow himself to get into a scowling mood while eating . " I dislike business with breakfast , " he stated . " Yeah , I know you do . " " You can fill in later . Get Saul and put him on the disbarmentof Mr. O'Malley . " " That was covered fairly well in the police file on Dykes . I 've told you about it . " " Nevertheless , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's associations outside that law office . "  | " He did n't have any to speak of . " " Put them on it . We 've made this assumption and we 'll either validate it or void it . Pursue your acquaintance with those women . Take one of them to lunch . " " Lunch is n't a good time . They only have  --  " " We 'll argue later . I want to read the paper . Have you had breakfast ? " " No . I got up late . " " Go and eat . " " Glad to . " Before I did so , I called Saul and Fred and Orrie and told them to come in for briefing . After breakfast I had that to attend to and also various office chores I had got behind on . There was a phone call from Purley Stebbins , who wanted to know how I had made out with my dinner party , and I asked him which one or ones he was tailing , or , as an alternative , which one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . I made no attempt to arrange to buy a lunch . So fast a follow-up on Sue would have been bad strategy , and a midday fifty minutes with one of the others would have given me no scope . Besides , I had had less than five hours ' sleep and had n't shaved . When Wolfe came down to the office at eleven he went over the morning mail , dictated a couple of letters , looked through a catalogue , and then requested a full report . To him a full report means every word and gesture and expression , and I have learned to fill the order not only to his satisfaction but to mine . It took more than an hour . When I was through , after asking a few questions , he issued a command . " Phone Miss Troy and take her to lunch . " I remained calm . " I understand and sympathize , " I toldp95him , " but I ca n't oblige . You 're desperate and therefore impulsive . I could present an overwhelming case against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's nearly one o'clock and that 's too late , and second , I do n't feel like it . There are some things I know more about than you do , and one of them is my extractive ability with women . Take it from me , it would be hard to conceive a lousier idea than for me to invite a middle-aged lawyer 's niece with pimples to a quick bite in a crowded midtown beanery , especially since she is probably right now on a stool at a fountain lunch working on a maple-nut sundae . " He shivered . " I 'm sorry to upset you , but maple-nut sundaes are  --  " " Shut up , " he growled . All the same , I was quite aware that it was up to me . True , Saul and Fred and Orrie were out collecting , but they were even farther away from Joan Wellman than I was , and that was some distance . If one of those ten females , or one of the other six whom I had n't met , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start Wolfe 's lips pushing out and in , no one but me was going to dig it out , and if I did n't want it to drag on into the Christmas season , only ten months away , I had better pull something . Back in the office after lunch , Wolfe was seated at his desk , reading a book of lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein , his mind a million miles from murder , and I was wandering around trying to think of something to pull , when the phone rang and I went to answer it . A woman 's voice told me , " Mr. Corrigan would like to speak to Mr. Wolfe . Put Mr. Wolfe on , please ? " I made a face . " Get home all right , Mrs. Adams ? "  | " Yes . " " Good . Mr. Wolfe is busy reading poetry . Put Corrigan on . " Really , Mr. Goodwin . " " I 'm stubborner than you are , and you made the call , I did n't . Put him on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James A. Corrigan , the senior partner . " Wolfe put the book down and took his instrument . I stayed on , as always when I was n't signaled to get off . " This is Nero Wolfe . " " This is Jim Corrigan . I 'd like to have a talk with you . " " Go ahead . " " Not on the phone , Mr. Wolfe . It would be better to meet , and some of my associates would like to sit in . Would it be convenient for you to call at our office , say around five-thirty ? One of my associates is in court . " " I do n't call at people 's offices , Mr. Corrigan . I stay in my office . I wo n't be available at five-thirty , but six would do if you wish to come . " " Six would be all right , but it would be better to make it here . There will be four of us  --  perhaps five . Six o'clock here ? " " No , sir . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . " It was more like three minutes . Then he was on again . " Sorry to keep you waiting . All right , we 'll be there at six or a little after . " Wolfe cradled his phone , and I did likewise . " Well , " I remarked , " at least we touched a sore spot somewhere . That 's the first cheep we 've got out of anybody in ten days . " " Wolfe picked up his book.  |p97That  was the biggest array of legal talent ever gathered in the office . Four counselors-at-law in good standing and one disbarred . James A. Corrigan ( secretary , Charlotte Adams ) was about the same age as his secretary , or maybe a little younger . He had the jaw of a prizefighter and the frame of a retired jockey and the hungriest pair of eyes I ever saw  --  not hungry the way a dog looks at a bone you 're holding up but the way a cat looks at a bird in a cage . Emmett Phelps ( secretary , Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that he was the firm 's encyclopedia , the guy who knew all the precedents and references and could turn to them with his eyes shut , but he did n't look it . Something over fifty , and a couple of inches over six feet , broad-shouldered and long-armed , on him a general 's or admiral 's uniform would have looked fine . Louis Kustin ( secretary , Eleanor Gruber ) was the youngster of the bunch , about my age . Instead of hungry eyes he had sleepy ones , very dark , but that must have been a cover because Sue had told me that he was their trial man , and hot , having taken over the tougher courtroomassignments when O'Malley had been disbarred . He looked smaller than he was on account of the way he slumped . Frederick Briggs , Helen Troy 's Uncle Fred , had whitep98hair and a long bony face . If he had a secretary I had n't met her . From the way he blinked like a half-wit at everyone who spoke , it seemed a wonder he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or it could have been his eighth  --  but it takes all kinds to make a law firm . I would n't have hired him to change blotters . Conroy O'Malley , who had been the senior partner and the courtroom wizard until he got bounced off the bar for bribing a juror , looked as bitter as you would expect , with a sidewise twist to his mouth that seemed to be permanent . With his mouth straightened and the sag out of his cheeks and a flash in his eye , it would n't have been hard to imagine him dominating a courtroom , but as he was then he could n't have dominated a phone booth with him alone in it . I had allotted the red leather chair to Corrigan , the senior partner , with the others in an irregular arc facing Wolfe 's desk . Usually , when there are visitors , I do n't get out my notebook and pen until Wolfe says to , but there was no law against my trying an experiment , so I had them ready and when Corrigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unanimous . They all yapped at once , absolutely horrified and outraged . I looked astonished . Wolfe , who knows me fairly well , thought he was going to slip me a caustic remark , but he had to chuckle . The idea of getting the goats of four lawyers and one ex-lawyer at one crack appealed to him too . " I do n't think , " he told me mildly , " we 'll need a record of this . " I put the notebook on my desk in easy reach . They did n't like it there so handy . Throughout the conference theyp99took turns darting glances at me to make sure I was n't sneaking in some symbols . " This is a confidential private conversation , " Corrigan stated . " Yes , sir , " Wolfe conceded . " But not privileged . I am not your client . " " Quite right . " Corrigan smiled , but his eyes stayed hungry . " We would n't mind if you were . We are not a hijacking firm , Mr. Wolfe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever need our services it would be a pleasure and an honor . " Wolfe inclined his head an eighth of an inch . I raised a brow the same distance . So they had brought butter along . " I 'll come straight to the point , " Corrigan declared . " Last evening you got more than half of our office staff down here and tried to seduce them . " " Seduction in its statutory sense , Mr. Corrigan ? " " No , no , of course not . Orchids , liquors , exotic foods  --  not to tempt their chastity but their discretion . Administeredby your Mr. Goodwin . " " I take responsibility for Mr. Goodwin 's actions on my premises as my agent . Are you charging me with a malum ? In se or prohibitum ? " " Not at all . Neither . Perhaps I started badly . I 'll describe the situation as we see it , and you correct me if I 'm wrong . A man named Wellman has engaged you to investigatethe death of his daughter . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two others , those of Leonard Dykes and Rachel Abrams . In  --  " " Not decided . Assumed as a working hypothesis . " " All right . And you 're working on it . You have two rea/sons for the assumption : the appearance of the name Baird Archer in all three cases , and the fact that all three died violently . The second is merely coincidental and would have no significance without the first . Looked at objectively , it does n't seem like a very good reason . We suspect you 're concentrating on this assumption because you ca n't find anything else to concentrate on , but of course we may be wrong . " " No . You 're quite right . " They exchanged glances . Phelps , the six-foot-plus encyclopedia , muttered something I did n't catch . O'Malley , the ex , was the only one who did n't react at all . He was too busy being bitter . " Naturally , " Corrigan said reasonably , ' we ca n't expect you to spread your cards out . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let you question us . " " About what ? " " Any and all relevant matters . We 're willing to spread our cards out , Mr. Wolfe ; we have to . Frankly , our firm is in a highly vulnerable position . We 've had all the scandal we can absorb . Only a little over a year ago our senior partner was disbarred and narrowly escaped a felony conviction . That was a major blow to the firm . We reorganized , months passed , we were regaining lost ground , and then our chief confidential clerk , Leonard Dykes , was murdered , and it was all reopened . There was never a shred of evidence that there was any connection between O'Malley 's disbarment and Dykes 's death , but it does n't take evidence to make scandal . It affected us even more seriously than the first blow ; the effect was cumulative . Weeks went by , and Dykes 's murder was still unsolved , and it was beginning to die down a little , when suddenlyP101it came back on us through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young woman named Joan Wellman . However , that was much less violent and damaging . It was confined mostly to an effort by the police to find some trace , through us or our staff , of a man who was named Baird Archer , or who had used that name , and the effort was completely unsuccessful . After a week of that it was petering out too , and then here they came again , we did n't know why at the time , but now we know it was because of the death of another young woman we had never heard of , named Rachel Abrams . At that point do n't you think we had a right to feel a little persecuted ? " Wolfe shrugged . " I doubt if it matters what I think . You did feel persecuted . " " We certainly did . We do . We have had enough . As you know , the Abrams girl died three days ago . Again what the police are after is a trace of a Baird Archer , though God knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a name at our office they should have dug it up long ago . Anyhow , there 's nothing we can do except hope they find their damned Baird Archer , and wait for this to begin to die down too . That 's how we felt yesterday . Do you know what happened in court this afternoon ? Louis Kustin was trying an important case for us , and during a recess opposingcounsel came up to him and said  --  what did he say , Louis ? " Kustin stirred in his chair . " He asked me what I was doing about a new connection when our firm dissolves . " His voice had a sharp edge , not at all sleepy like his eyes . " He was trying to get me sore to spoil my style . He did n't succeed . " " You see , " Corrigan told Wolfe . " Well , that 's how wep102felt yesterday . Then those boxes of orchids came with notes from your man Goodwin . Then today we learn what happenedlast night . We learn what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our staff that you have an idea that a trail to the murderer of the Wellman girl can be picked up at our office , that he never saw you more bullheaded about an idea , and that your client and you both intend to go the limit . We know enough about you and your methods to know what that means . As long as you 've got that idea you 'll never let go . The police and the talk may die down and even die out , but you wo n't , and God knows what you 'll do to our staff . You 've damn near got them scratching and pulling hair already . " " Nuts , " I cut in . " They 've been at it for months . " " They were cooling off . You got ' em tight and then brought in a bereaved father and mother to work on their nerves . God only knows what you 'll do next . " Corrigan returned to Wolfe . " So here we are . Ask us anything you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ahead and work on it . You 're investigating the murder of Joan Wellman , and you think one of us has something for you , maybe all of us . Here we are . Get it over with . " Corrigan looked at me and asked politely , " Could I have a drink of water ? " I took it for granted that he meant with something in it and asked him what , meanwhile pushing a button for Fritz , since I was n't supposed to leave a conference unless I had to . Also I broadened the invitation . Two of them liked Scotch , two bourbon , and one rye . They exchanged remarks . Briggs , the blinking half-wit , got up to stretch and crossed the room for a look at the big globe , probably with the notion of trying to find out where he was . Ip103noticed that Wolfe did not order beer , which seemed to be stretching things pretty thin . I had nothing against his habit of using reasonable precaution not to take refreshmentwith a murderer , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had absolutely nothing to point at them with . Bullheaded was putting it mildly . Corrigan put his half-empty glass down and said , " Go ahead . " Wolfe grunted . " As I understand it , sir , you invite me to ask questions and satisfy myself that my assumption is not valid . That could take all night . I 'm sorry , but my dinner dish this evening is not elastic . " " We 'll go out and come back . " " And I ca n't commit myself to satisfaction by an hour or even a day . " " We do n't expect a commitment . We just want to get you off our necks as soon as possible without having our organization and our reputation hurt worse than they are already . " " Very well . Here 's a question . Which one of you first suggested this meeting with me ? " " What difference does that maker " I 'm asking the questions , Mr. Corrigan . " " So you are . It was  --  " The senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " Phelps contradicted him . " You came to my room and asked me what I thought of it . " " Then it was you , Fred ? " Briggs blinked . " I really could n't say , Jim . I make so many suggestions , I may well have made this one . I know Louis phoned in at his lunch recess to ask for some figures , and we were discussing it . "  | " That 's right , " Kustin agreed . " You said it was being considered . " " You 're having a hell of a time answering a simple question , " a biting voice told them . It was Conroy O'Malley , the ex . " The suggestion came from me . I phoned you around eleven o'clock , Jim , and you told me about Nero Wolfe smashing in , and I said the only thing to do was have a talk with him . " Corrigan screwed up his lips . " That 's right . Then I went in to get Emmett 's opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Corrigan around eleven this morning ? " " Yes . " What about ? " " To get the news . I had been out of town for a week , and the minute I returned the police had got at me again about Baird Archer . I wondered why . " " What were you doing out of town ? " " I was in Atlanta , Georgia , getting facts about the deliveryof steel for a bridge . " " On behalf of whom ? " " This firm . " O'Malley 's mouth twisted until it was distortedalmost to a diagonal . " You do n't think my old associateswould let me starve , do you ? No indeed . I eat every day . Not only do I get a share of the income from unfinished business when I left , I am also given work to do outside the office . Do you know what is the outstanding characteristic of my former associates ? Love for their fellow man . " He tapped his chest with a forefinger . " I am their fellow man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " where does that get you ? What do you want ? What do you expect ? "  |p105A  gleam had come and gone in Kustin 's sleepy eyes as O'Malley spoke . He said dryly , " We 're here to answer Wolfe 's questions . Let 's keep the answers responsive . " " No , " Wolfe said , " this is n't a courtroom . Sometimes an unresponsive answer is the most revealing , almost as good as a lie . But I hope you will resort to lies as little as possible , since they will be of use to me only when exposed and that 's a lot of work . For instance , I am going to ask each of you if you have ever tried your hand at writing fiction or had a marked and sustained desire to write fiction . If you all say no , and if later , through interviews with friends and acquaintances , I find that one of you lied , that will be of some value to me , but it will save trouble if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever tried writing fiction , Mr. O'Malley ? Or wanted to , beyond a mere whim ? " " No . " " Mr. Briggs ? " " No . " He got five noes . Wolfe leaned back and surveyed them . " Of course , " he said , " it is clearly essential to my assumption that either Leonard Dykes or someone he knew wrote a piece of fiction long enough to be called a novel  --  Dykes himself by preference , since he was killed . Doubtless the police have touched on this in questioning you , and you have disclaimedany knowledge of such an activity by Dykes , but I like things firsthand . Mr. Corrigan , have you ever had any information or hint , from any source , that Dykes had written , was writing , or wanted or intended to write , a work of fiction ? " " No. "  | " Mr. Phelps ? " Five noes again . Wolfe nodded . " That shows why , even if you put up with this for a solid week , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of operation Mr. Goodwin is highly qualified . If you admonish those young women not to see him , I doubt if it will work . If they disobey and you fire them , you will merely make them riper for him . If you warn them specifically that any knowledge they may have , however slight , of Dykes 's literary performances or ambitionsis not to be disclosed , sooner or later Mr. Goodwin will know it , and I shall ask why you do n't want me to get facts . And if any of them does innocently have such knowledge , perhaps from some remark once heard , we 'll get it . " They did n't care for that . Louis Kustin was displaying a bored smile . " We 're not schoolboys , Wolfe . We graduated long ago . Speaking for myself , you 're welcome to any fact you can get , no matter what , that 's conceivably connected with your case . I do n't know any . I 'm here  --  all of us are  --  to satisfy you on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Kustin . " Wolfe was placid . " I gather that although the disbarment of Mr. O'Malley was a blow to the firm 's reputation , you personally benefitedfrom it by being made a partner and by replacing Mr. O'Malley as chief trial counsel . Is that correct ? " Kustin 's eyes woke up . They gleamed . " I deny that that has any connection with your case . " " We 're proceeding on my assumption . Of course you may decline to answer , but if you do , what are you here for ? " " Answer him , Louis , " O'Malley said jeeringly . " Justsay yes.  |p107They  looked at each other . I doubt if either of them had ever regarded opposing counsel with just that kind of hostility . Then Kustin 's eyes , anything but sleepy now , returned to Wolfe and he said , " Yes . " " And naturally your share of the firm 's profits was in-creased ? " " Yes . " " Substantially ? " " Yes . " Wolfe 's glance went left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the senior partner with an increased share ? " Corrigan 's prizefighter 's jaw was jutting . " I became the senior in a firm that was damn near on the rocks . My percentage of the profits went up , but the profits went down . I would have done better to cut loose . " " Was there anything to stop you ? " O'Malley inquired . From his tone I would have guessed that he hated Corrigan about one-fifth as much as he did Kustin . " Yes , Con , there was . I had my associates to think of . My name was on the door with theirs . There was loyalty to stop me . " " Suddenly , totally without warning , O'Malley bounded to his feet . I suppose he had done it a thousand times in a courtroom , to object to a question or dramatize a motion to dismiss , but it startled the others as much as it did me . He flung up an arm and called out in a ringing voice , " Loyalty ! " Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raised it , said , " To loyalty , " and drank . The four firm members glanced at one another . I changed my mind about O'Malley 's ability to dominate a phone booth.  |p108Wolfe  spoke . " And you , Mr. Briggs ? You also moved up when Mr. O'Malley was out ? " Briggs blinked violently . " I resent this , " he said stiffly . " I am opposed to this whole procedure . I know something of you , Mr. Wolfe , and I regard your methods as unethical and reprehensible . I am here under protest . " " Frederick , " O'Malley said gravely , " should be on the bench . He should have been appointed to the bench as soon as he was out of law school . He would be an ideal judge . He has the kind of daring mind that glories in decidingan issue without understanding it . " Phelps , the encyclopedia , protested , " Everybody ca n't be brilliant like you , Con . Maybe it 's just as well they ca n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , Emmett . But you 're always right . I 've never resented it , you know , your always being right , I do n't know why . Not because you 're the only one who did n't profit by my downfall ; I never resented it . " " I did profit . I moved up one and I get a bigger cut . " Phelps went to Wolfe . " We all profited by our partner 's misfortune , or we will , if this does n't ruin us altogether . Even I. Strictly speaking , I am not an attorney-at-law ; I am a scholar . To a lawyer the most interesting case is the one he is currently engaged in . To me the most interesting case is one that was tried in Vienna in 1568 . I inject this only to explain why this case of yours is to me unutterably dull . It might not be if I had myself killed Dykes and those two young women , but I doubt it . I would be attentive , naturally , but not interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That , I thought , might be useful in future conversations with Sue Dondero , Phelps 's secretary . From her scantyp109remarks about her boss I had n't got that slant on him , and surely she would like to know more about him if she did n't already . Girls feel that it 's their duty to know all about their bosses . Wolfe was cocking his head at the encyclopedia . " Murdersbore you , Mr. Phelps ? " " I did n't say that . Bore ' is an active verb . I am merely indifferent . " But is n't your livelihood involved ? " " Yes . That 's why I 'm here . I came and I 'll talk , but do n't expect to arouse me . " " Then I wo n't try . " Wolfe 's eyes moved . " By the way , Mr. O'Malley , why are you here ? " " Loyalty . " I had refilled O'Malley 's glass , and he lifted it . " To loyalty ! " " To whom ? Your former associates ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well disposed toward them . " " That just shows "  --  O'Malley put his glass down  --  " how wrong appearances can be . My old friends Jim and Emmett and Louis and Fred ? I 'd go through hell for them  --  in fact I have . Is n't that acceptable as my motive for com-ing ? " " I 'd prefer something a little less moot . " " Then try this . I was a man of extraordinary talent and not without ambition . My talent had been developed and my faculties trained to one end : to enter a courtroom with a briefcase , confront a judge and jury , and so manipulate their thoughts and emotions that I got the verdict I wanted . I had n't lost a case for four years when one day I found myself faced by certain defeat ; there was no question about it . Under that pressure I did something foolish : Ip110bribed a juror , the first and only time . I got a hung jury , and a few weeks later got a settlement out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , when suddenly it hit me . Someone informed the court , they got the juror in and worked on him and broke him , and there I was . Insufficientevidence saved me from a felony conviction , the jury was divided six to six , but I was disbarred . " " Who informed the court ? " " I did n't know at the time . Now I have reason to believe it was the juror 's wife . " " Were any of your associates privy to your act ? " " No . They would n't have stood for it . They were shocked  --  the shock of righteous men  --  meaning by righteous men ' those who have not been caught . They were also loyal , they helped me fight it , but it was hopeless . So here I am , a man with an extraordinary talent that ca n't be used . I can use it only in one place and I am not allowed to go there . Moreover , I am stigmatized . People who could use my talents outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke . I 'm in no position to postulate that I should go on living ; there seems no point in it ; but through perversity I 'm going to . My only source of income is this firm , payments on account of business that was unfinished when I left , and they give me errands to do . So it is to my interest for the firm to prosper . I offer that as my reason for coming here with them . If you do n't like it either , I have still another alternative . Would you like to hear it ? " " If it is n't too fanciful . " " It 's not fanciful at all . I am embittered against my former associates because they let me down . I think it quite possible that one of them killed Dykes and the twop111women , though I have no idea why , and that you 're going to hang on until you get it , and I want to see it happen . Do you like that better ? " " It has attractions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dykes and the women , though again I have no idea why , and I think you 're more dangerous than the police and want to keep an eye on you . " O'Malley picked up his glass . " That 's four , that should be enough . " " It 'll do for the time being , " Wolfe concurred . " Of course they 're mutually exclusive . In one your associates helped you fight and in another they let you down . Which was it actually ? " " They fought like tigers to save me . " " Goddam it , Con , " Phelps exploded , " we did ! We let everything else go ! We did our damnedest ! " O'Malley was unmoved . " Then you 'd better take that one , " he told Wolfe . " Number Two . It has corroboration , which is always a help . " " I prefer it anyway . " Wolfe glanced up at the clock on the wall . " I want all you can tell me about Dykes , gentlemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry we 're not prepared for guests . " They left their chairs . Corrigan asked , " What time do you want us back ? " Wolfe made a face . He hated the prospect of work during digestion . " Nine o'clock ? " he suggested . " Will that suit ? " They said it would.  |p112When  , an hour after midnight , Wolfe finally called it a day and let them go , it looked as if I would be seeing a lot of the girls . Not that they had balked at answering questions . We had at least four thousand facts , an average of a thousand an hour , but if anyone had offered me a dime for the lot it would have been a deal . We were full of information to the gills , but not a glimmer of Baird Archer or fiction writing or anything pertaining thereto . Wolfe had even sunk so low as to ask where and how they had spent the evening of February second and the afternoon of February twenty-sixth , though the cops had of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough about Leonard Dykes to write his biography , either straight or in novel form . Havingstarted in as office boy , by industry , application , loyalty , and a satisfactory amount of intelligence , he had worked up to office manager and confidential clerk . He was not married . He had smoked a pipe , and had once got pickled on two glasses of punch at an office party , proving that he was not a drinker . He had had no known interest in anything outside his work except baseball in summer and professional hockey games in winter . And so forth and so on . None of the five had any notion about who had killed him or why . They kept getting into squabbles about anything and everything . For instance , when Wolfe was asking aboutp113Dykes 's reaction to the disbarment of O'Malley , and was told by Corrigan that Dykes had written him a letter of resignation , Wolfe wanted to know when . Sometime in the summer , Corrigan said , he did n't remember exactly , probably in July . Wolfe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he put it , " Corrigan replied , " but he was just being scrupulous . He said he had heard that there was talk among the staff that he was responsible for O'Malley 's trouble , that it was baseless , but that we might feel it would be harmful to the firm for him to continue . He also said that it was under O'Malley as senior that he had been made office manager , and that the new regime might want to make a change , and that therefore he was offering his resignation . " " Wolfe grunted . " Was it accepted ? " " Certainly not . I called him in and told him that we were completely satisfied with him , and that he should ignore the office gossip . " " I 'd like to see his letter . You have it ? " " I suppose it was filed  --  " Corrigan stopped . " No , it was n't . I sent it to Con O'Malley . He may have it . " " I returned it to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember it . " " He must have , " Phelps declared , " because when you showed it to me  --  no , that was another letter . When you showed me Dykes 's resignation you said you were going to send it to Con . " " He did , " O'Malley said . " And I returned it  --  wait a minute , I 'm wrong . I returned it to Fred , in person . I stopped in at the office , and Jim was n't there , and I gave it to Fred . "  |p114Briggs  was blinking at him . " That , " he said stiffly , " is absolutely false . Emmett showed me that letter . " He blinked around . " I resent it , but I 'm not surprised . We all know that Con is irresponsible and a liar . " " Goddam it , Fred , " Phelps objected , " why should he lie about a thing like that ? He did n't say he showed it to you , he said he gave it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's absolutely false ! " " I do n't believe , " Wolfe interposed , " that the issue merits such heat . I would like to see not only that letter but also anything else that Dykes wrote  --  letters , memoranda , reports  --  or copies of them . I want to know how he used words . I would like that letter to be included if it is available . I do n't need a stack of material  --  half a dozen items will do . May I have them ? " They said he might . When they had gone I stretched , yawned , and inquired , " Do we discuss it now or wait till morning ? " " What the devil is there to discuss ? " Wolfe shoved his chair back and arose . " Go to bed . " He marched out to his elevator . Next day , Friday , I had either bum luck or a double brush-off , I was n't sure which . Phoning Sue Dondero to propose some kind of joint enterprise , I was told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't return until late Sunday evening . Phoning EleanorGruber as the best alternative , I was told that she was already booked . I looked over the list , trying to be objectiveabout it , and settled on Blanche Duke . When I got her I must admit she did n't sound enthusiastic , but probablyshe never did at the switchboard . She could n't make it Friday but signed up for Saturday at seven.  |p115We  were getting reports by phone from Saul and Fred and Orrie , and Friday a little before six Saul came in person . The only reason I would n't vote for Saul Panzer for President of the United States is that he would never dress the part . How he goes around New York , almost anywhere , in that faded brown cap and old brown suit , without attracting attention as not belonging , I will never understand . Wolfe has never given him an assignment that he did n't fill better than anyone else could except me , and my argument is why not elect him President , buy him a suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge of one of the yellow chairs and asked , " Anything fresh ? " " No , " I told him . " As you know , it is usually impossible to tell just when a case will end , but this time it 's a cinch . When our client 's last buck is spent we 'll quit . " " As bad as that ? Is Mr. Wolfe concentrating ? " " You mean is he working or loafing . He 's loafing . He has started asking people where they were at three-fifteenMonday afternoon , February twenty-sixth . That 's a hell of a way for a genius to perform . " Wolfe entered , greeted Saul , and got behind his desk . Saul reported . Wolfe wanted full details as usual , and got them : the names of the judge , jury foreman , and others , the nature of the case that O'Malley had been losing , including the names of the litigants , and so forth . The informationhad gone to the court by mail in an unsigned typewritten letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the juror after a few hours ' checkup . Efforts to trace the informing letter had failed . After an extended session with city employees , the juror had admitted gettingthree thousand dollars in cash from O'Malley , andp116more than half of it had been recovered . Louis Kustin had been defense attorney at the trials of both the juror and O'Malley , and by brilliant performances had got hung juries in both cases . Saul had spent a day trying to get to the archives for a look at the unsigned typewritten informingletter , but had failed . The bribed juror was a shoe salesman named Anderson . Saul had had two sessions with him and his wife . The wife 's position stood on four legs : one , she had not writtenthe letter ; two , she had not known that her husband had taken a bribe ; three , if she had known he had taken a bribe she certainly would n't have told on him ; and four , she did n't know how to typewrite . Apparently her husbandbelieved her . That did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believing their wives is unbounded , but when Saul too voted for her that was enough for Wolfe and me . Saul can smell a liar through a concrete wall . He offered to bring the Andersons in for Wolfe to judge for himself , but Wolfe said no . Saul was told to join Fred and Orrie in the check of Dykes 's friends and acquaintances outside the office . Saturday morning a large envelope arrived by messenger . Inside was a note from Emmett Phelps , the six-foot scholar who was indifferent to murder , typed on the firm 's letterhead : Dear Mr. Wolfe : I am sending herewith , as you requested , some material written by Leonard Dykes . Included is his letter of resignation dated July 19 , 1950 , which you said you would like to see . Evidently Mr. O'Malley 's statement that he had returned the letter to Mr. Briggs was correct ,  |p117since  it was here in our files . Mr. O'Malley was in the office yesterday and I told him the letter had been found . Kindly return the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PhelpsDykes 's letter of resignation was a full page , singlespaced , but all it said was what Corrigan had told us  --  that on account of the staff gossip that he had informed on O'Malley and so damaged the firm 's reputation , and , further , because the new regime might want to make a change , he respectfully submitted his resignation . He had used three times as many words as he needed . As for the rest of the material  --  memoranda , reports , and copies of letters  --  it may have shown Wolfe how Dykes used words , but aside from that it was as irrelevant as last year 's box score . Wolfe waded through it , passing each item to me as he finished , and I read every word , not wanting to leave an opening for another remark about my powers of observation like the time I had muffed the name of Baird Archer . When I had finished I handed the lot back to him , with some casual comment , and got at my typewriterto do some letters he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded , . " What does this stand for ? " I got up to go and look . In his hand was Dykes 's letter of resignation . He slid it across to me . " That notation in pencil in the corner . What is it ? " I looked at it , a pencil scribble like this :  |p118I  nodded . " Yeah , I noticed it . Search me . Public School 146 , Third Grade ? " " The S is lower case . " " So it is . Am I supposed to pop it out ? " " No . It 's probably frivolous , but its oddity stirs curiosity . Does it suggest anything to you ? " I pursed my lips to look thoughtful . " Not offhand . Does it to you ? " He reached for it and frowned at it . " It invites speculation . With a capital P and a small S , it is presumably not initials . I know of only one word or name in the language for which Ps ' is commonly used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase the likelihood . Still no suggestion ? " " Well , Ps ' stands for postscript , and the figures  --  " " No . Get the Bible . " I crossed to the bookshelves , got it , and returned . " Turn to Psalm One-forty-six and read the third verse . " I admit I had to use the index . Having done so , I turnedthe pages , found it , and gave it a glance . " I 'll be damned , " I muttered . " Read it ! " Wolfe bellowed . I read aloud . " Put not your trust in princes , nor in the son of man , in whom there is no help . ' " " Ah , " Wolfe said , and sighed clear to his middle . " Okay , " I conceded . " Put Not Your Trust ' was the title of Baird Archer 's novel . At last you 've got a man on base , but by a fluke . I hereby enter it for the record in coincidences that the item you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . If that 's how  --  " " Pfui , " Wolfe snorted . " There was nothing coincidentalp119about it , and any lummox could have interpreted that notation . " " I 'm a superlummox . " No . " He was so pleased he felt magnanimous . " You got it for us . You got those women here and scared them . You scared them so badly that one or more of them felt it necessary to concede a connection between Baird Archer and someone in that office . " " One of whom ? The women ? " " I think not . I prefer a man , and it was the men I asked for material written by Dykes . You scared a man or men . I want to know which one or ones . You have an engagementfor this evening ? " " Yes . With a blond switchboard operator . Three shades of blond on one head . " " Very well . Find out who made that notation on Dykes 's letter in that square distinctive hand . I hope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shook his head . " I must correct myself . All I expect you to learn is whose hand that notation resembles . It would be better not to show the letter and the notation itself . " " Sure . Make it as tough as you can . " But it was n't as tough as it sounded because the handwritingwas so easy to imitate . During the afternoon I practiced it plenty before I prepared my bait . When I left for my date at 6:40 I had with me , in the breast pocket of my newest lightweight blue suit , one of the items that had been sent us  --  a typewritten memorandum from LeonardDykes  --  with a penciled notation in the margin made by me :  |p120Blanche  Duke surprised me that evening . She had two shots of her special formula  --  gin , vermouth , grenadine , and Pernod  --  before dinner , and then quit . No more . Also she wore a nice simple blue dress and went easy with cosmetics . Also , most important , she could dance much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not something for the Bobolink to stare at , she certainly needed no excuses , and she made the Bobolink band seem even better than it was . By ten o'clock I would have been perfectly willing to split the check with our client . But I was there on business . When we went back to our table after I had fancied up a samba all I could and she had kept with me as though we had done it a hundred times , and I insisted that with dinner only a memory it was time for a drink , she refused . " Look , " I objected , " this is n't going right . All I 'm gettingout of it is a good time , when I 'm supposed to be working . The idea was to get you lit enough to loosen up , and you 're drinking water . How can I get you babbling if you wo n't drink ? " " I like to dance , " she stated . " No wonder , the way you do it . So do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to quit enjoying myself and drag something out of you . " She shook her head . " I do n't drink when I 'm dancingp121because I like to dance . Try me tomorrow afternoon while I 'm washing my hair . I hate washing my damn hair . What makes you think there 's something in me to drag out ? " Our waiter was hovering , and I appeased him with an order for something . " Well , " I told her , " there ought to be , since you think O'Malley killed Dykes . You must have some reason  --  " " I do n't think that . " " You said you did Wednesday evening . " She waved a hand . " It gets Eleanor Gruber 's goat . She 's crazy about O'Malley . I do n't think that at all . I think Len Dykes committed suicide . " " Oh . Whose goat does that get ? " " Nobody 's . It might get Sue 's , but I like her , so I do n't say it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why her ? " " Well  --  " Blanche frowned . " Of course you did n't know Len Dykes . " " No . " He was a funny duck . He was a nice guy in a way , but he was funny . He had inhibitions about women , but he carried a picture of one in his wallet , and who do you think it was ? His sister , for God 's sake ! Then one day I saw him -- She stopped abruptly . The band had struck up a conga . Her shoulders moved to the beat . There was only one thing to do . I stood up and extended a hand , and she came , and we edged through to the floor . A quarter of an hour later we returned to the table , sat , and exchanged glances of unqualified approval . " Let 's get the dragging over with , " I suggested , " andp122then we can do some serious dancing . You were saying that one day you saw Dykes  --  doing what ? " She looked blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do we really have to go on with this ? " " I do . " " Okay . I saw him looking at Sue . Brother , that was a look ! I kidded him about it , which was a mistake , because it made him decide to pick me to tell about it . It was the first time  --  " " When was this ? " " A year ago , maybe more . It was the first time he had ever put an eye on a woman , at his age ! And he had fallen for her so hard he might as well have had an ulcer . He kept it covered all right , except with me , but I certainly got it . He tried to date her , but nothing doing . He asked me what to do , and I had to tell him something , so I told him Sue was the kind of girl who was looking for glamour , and he ought to get famous somehow , like getting elected senator or pitching for the Yankees or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the publishers would n't take it , and he killed himself . " I showed no excitement . " He told you he wrote a book ? " " No , he never mentioned it . Along about then he stopped talking about her , and I never brought it up because I did n't want to get him started again . But it was one of the things I suggested , and there 's all this racket about a book that got rejected , so why ca n't I put two and two together ? " I could have objected that suicide by Dykes in Decemberwould n't help to explain the murder of Joan Wellman and Rachel Abrams in February , but I wanted to get top123the point before the band started up again . I took a sip of my drink . I smiled at her to keep it friendly . " Even if you 're right about the suicide , what if you 're shifting the cast ? What if it was you instead of Sue he put his eye on ? " She snorted . " Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " " I do n't . " My hand went to my breast pocket and came out with a folded paper . " This is a memorandum on office expenses prepared by Dykes , dated last May . " I unfolded it . " I was going to ask you why he scribbled your home phone number on it , but now you can just say it was while he was telling you about Sue and asking your advice , so what 's the use . " I started to refold it . " My phone number ? " she demanded . " Yep . Columbus three , four-six-two-oh . " " Let me see it . " I handed it to her , and she took a look . She held it to her right to get more light and looked again . " Len did n't write that , " she declared . " Why not ? " " It 's not his writing . " " Whose is it ? Yours ? " " No . It 's Corrigan 's . He writes square like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this , anyhow ? Why should Corrigan be putting my phone number on this old memo ? " " Oh , forget it . " I reached and took the paper from her fingers . " I thought maybe Dykes had written it and just thought I 'd ask . Corrigan may have wanted to phone you about something after office hours . " A rattle came from the drum , and the band slid into a trot . I put the memo in myp124pocket and stood up . " Skip it . Let 's see how we like this . " We liked it fine . When I got home , around two , Wolfe had gone up to bed . I slid the bolts on the front and back doors , twirled the knob of the safe , and drank a glass of milk before ascending . People are never satisfied . What was on my mind as I pulled the covers up was the contrariness of life . Why could n't it have been Sue who danced like that instead of Blanche ? If a man could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule at Wolfe 's house was different since Marko Vukcic , his closest friend and the owner of Rusterman 's Restaurant , had talked him into installing a pool table in the basement . It was now routine for Wolfe to spend Sunday morning in the kitchen with Fritz , preparingsomething special . At one-thirty Marko would arriveto help appreciate it , after which they would go to the basement for a five-hour session with the cues . I rarely took part , even when I was around , because it made Wolfe grumpy when I got lucky and piled up a big run . That Sunday I fully expected to upset the schedule when Wolfe , having breakfasted in his room , entered the kitchen and I told him , " That notation on that letter is in the handwritingof James A. Corrigan , the senior partner . " He scowled at me a moment , then turned to Fritz . " I have decided , " he said aggressively , " not to use the goose fat . " I raised my voice . " That notation on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to Mr. Cramer and tell him about it . " It would have done no good to scream , not when he used that tone , so I controlled myself . " You have trained me , "  |p125I  said stiffly , " to remember conversations verbatim , includingyours . Yesterday you said you wanted to know who we had scared and whose hand that notation resembles . I spent a whole evening and a wad of Wellman 's dough finding out . To hand it to Cramer , for God 's sake ? What if it is Sunday ? If they 're scared they 'll come . May I use the phone ? " His lips had tightened . " What else did you get ? " " Nothing . That 's what you asked for . " " Very well . Satisfactory . Fritz and I are going to do a guinea hen , and there is barely time . If you get Mr. Corrigandown here , or even all of them , what will happen ? I will show him that notation and he will deny all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , and will be told that it has been easily accessible to all of them . That will take perhaps five minutes . Then what ? " " Nuts . If you insist on playing pool instead of working on Sunday , wait till tomorrow . Why hand it to Cramer ? " " Because for its one purpose he is as good as I am  --  even better . It validates for them , if not for me , my assumption that someone in that firm has a guilty connection with the murder of three people . We have already scared him into this ; with that letter a police inspector may scare him into something else . Take it to Mr. Cramer and do n't bother me . You know quite well that for me pool is not play ; it is exercise . " He strode to the refrigerator . I had a notion to spend a couple of hours with the Sundaypapers before going downtown , but decided there was no point in my being childish just because Wolfe was . Besides , with him I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook and eat and play pool instead of working ,  |p126but  it could also be that he was pulling something fancy . He often got subtle without letting me in on it , and it was n't impossible that there was something about that notation , or the way we got it , that made him figure it would be better to turn it over to Cramer than spring it himself . Walking the fifteen blocks to Twentieth Street with a cold March wind whipping at me from the right , I considered the matter and concluded that it might either rain or snow . Cramer was n't in , but Sergeant Purley Stebbins was . He gave me the chair at the end of his desk and listened to my tale . I gave it all to him except the detail of how we had learned it was Corrigan 's handwriting , seeing no necessity of dragging Blanche into it . I merely told him that we had good reason to believe that it looked like Corrigan 's writing . Of course he knew that Baird Archer 's novel had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around for a Bible to check on the third verse of the 146th Psalm , but could n't find one . He was skeptical , but not about that . " You say Wolfe got this letter yesterday ? " he demanded . " Right . " " And he 's done nothing about it ? " " Right . " " He has n't asked Corrigan about it , or any of the others ? " " Right . " " Then what the hell 's wrong with it ? " " Nothing that I know of . We 're cooperating . " Purley snorted . " Nero Wolfe passing us a juicy item like this without first squeezing it for himself ? Poop . " " If you do n't like it , " I said with dignity , Tll take itp127back and see if I can get you something better . Would you accept a signed confession with dates and places ? " " I 'll accept a signed statement from you , telling how you got this . " " Glad to , if you 'll give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I expected , an Underwood about my age . I demanded a new ribbon , and they finally dug one up . Back at home I did a few chores in the office and then got comfortable with the Sunday papers . Wolfe came in now and then for a section to take to the kitchen . Around noon he entered , sat behind his desk , and requested a full report of my evening with Miss Duke . Evidently the guinea hen was under control . I obliged , thinking he might let me in on the strategy if that was what it was , but all I got was a nod . That was all for Sunday , except that after dinner I got invited to the pool game and made a run of twenty-nine , and after supper I was instructed to tell Saul and Fred and Orrie to report in at eleven in the morning . They were there when Wolfe came down from the plant rooms : Saul Panzer , small and wiry , in his old brown suit ; Fred Durkin , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red leather chair by right of seniority ; and Orrie Cather , with his square jaw and crew cut , looking young enough to still be playing pro football . Wolfe took Fred first , then Orrie , and Saul last . Adding what they told us to what we already knew from the police file and the girls and the firm members , including Blanche 's little contribution Saturday evening , we were certainly up on Leonard Dykes . I could givep128you fifty pages on him , but it would leave you just where we were , so what 's the use ? If anyone who had known him had any idea who had killed him or why , they were n't saying . Saul and Fred and Orrie were three good men , and they had n't got the faintest glimmer , though they had covered every possible source except Dykes 's sister , who was in California . Wolfe kept them till lunchtimeand then cut them loose . Saul , who hated to turn in an empty bag even more than I did , offered to spend another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolfe said no . When they had gone Wolfe sat and stared across the room at nothing a full three minutes before he pushed back his chair , though Fritz had announced lunch . Then he heaved a deep sigh , got himself up , and growled at me to come on . We had just returned to the office after a silent meal that was anything but convivial when the doorbell rang and I went to answer it . Not many times has it given me pleasure to see a cop on that stoop , but that was one of them . Even a humble dick would have been a sign that something had happened or might be ready to happen , and this was Inspector Cramer himself . I opened up and invited him to cross the sill , took his hat and coat , and escorted him to the office without bothering to announce him . He grunted at Wolfe , and Wolfe grunted back . He sat , got a cigar from his vest pocket , inspected it , stuck it between his teeth , moved his jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out again . " I 'm deciding how to start this , " he muttered . " Can I help ? " Wolfe asked politely . " Yes . But you wo n't . One thing , I 'm not going to get sore . It would n't do any good , because I doubt if I 've gotp129anything on you that would stick . Is that deal we made still on ? " " Of course . Why not ? " " Then you will kindly fill me in . When you decided to trick us into taking a jab at someone , why did you pick Corrigan ? " Wolfe shook his head . " You had better start over , Mr. Cramer . That 's the worst possible way . There was no trick  --  " Cramer cut in rudely and emphatically with a vulgar word . He went on . " I said I 'm not going to get sore , and I 'm not , but look at it . You get hold of that letter with that notation on it , the first real evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baird Archer and therefore with the murders . A real hot find . There were several ways you could have used it , but you pass them all up and send the letter down to me . I send Lieutenant Rowcliff up there this morning . Corrigan admits the notation resembles his handwriting , but absolutely deniesthat he made it or ever saw it or has any idea what it stands for . The others all make the same denials . " Cramer cocked his head . " I 've sat here many a time and listened to you making an assumption on poorer ground than what I 've made this one on . I do n't know how you got hold of a sample of Corrigan 's handwriting , but that would have been easy . And I do n't know whether it was you or Goodwin who made that notation on that letter , and I do n't care . One of you did . All I want to know is , why ? You 're too smart and too lazy to play a trick like that just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sore and I 'm not going to get sore . You expected it to get you something . What ? "  |p130He  put the cigar in his mouth and sank his teeth in it . Wolfe regarded him . " Confound it , " he said regretfully , " we 're not going to get anywhere . " " Why not ? I 'm being goddam reasonable . " " You are indeed . But we ca n't meet . You will listen to me only if I concede your assumption that Mr. Goodwin or I made the notation on the letter , imitating Corrigan 's hand . You will not listen to me if I deny that and substitute my own assumption , that the notation was in fact a trick but not mine . Will you ? " " Try it . " " Very well . Someone wanted to provide me with evidence that would support the line I was taking , but of such a nature and in such a manner that I would be left exactly where I was . Its pointing at Corrigan may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at someone , and it may be that Corrigan was selected because he is somehow invulnerable . I preferred not to make an ass of myself by acting on it . All I would have got was a collection of denials . As it now stands , LieutenantRowcliff got the denials , and I am uncommitted . They do n't know  --  he does n't know  --  how I took it . For my part , I do n't know who he is or what is moving him or why he wants to prod me , but I would like to know . If he acts again I may find out . " Wolfe upturned a palm . " That 's all . " " I do n't believe it . " " I did n't expect you to . " " Okay . I 've listened to it on your assumption , now try mine . You made the notation on the letter yourself and made me a present of it . Why ? " " No , Mr. Cramer . I 'm sorry , but that 's beyond my pow/ers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses , and in that case why waste time on me ? " " I wo n't . " Cramer left his chair , and as he did so his determinationnot to get sore suddenly went up the flue . He hurled his unlit cigar at my wastebasket , missed by a yard , and hit me on the ankle . " Fat bloated lousy liar , " he rasped , and turned and tramped out . Thinking that under the circumstances it was just as well to let him wriggle into his coat unaided , I stayed put . But also thinking that he might take a notion to try a simplelittle trick himself , when the front door slammed I got up and moseyed to the hall for a look through the one-way glass panel , and saw him cross to the sidewalk and get into his car , the door of which had been opened for an inspector . When I returned to the office Wolfe was leaning back with his eyes closed and his brow creased . I sat . I hoped to God he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the expression on his face I had another hope coming . I looked at my wrist and saw 2:52 . When I looked again it said 3:06 . I wanted to yawn but thought I did n't deserve to , and choked it . Wolfe 's voice blurted , " Where 's Mr. Wellman ? " - 'b " In Peoria . He went Friday . " He had opened his eyes and straightened up . " How long does it take an airplane to get to Los Angeles ? " " Ten or eleven hours . Some of them more . " " When does the next one go ? " " I do n't know . " " " Find out . Wait . Have we ever before been driven to extremities as now ? " " No "  | " I agree . His gambit of that notation on that letter  --  what for ? Confound him ! Nothing but denials . You have the name and address of Dykes 's sister in California . " " Yes , sir . " " " Phone Mr. Wellman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Tell him it is either that or abandon the case . If he approves the expenditure , reserve a seat on the next plane and get packed . By then I shall have instructions ready for you . Is there plenty of cash in the safe ? " " Yes . " " Take enough . You are willing to cross the continent in an airplane ? " " I 'll risk it . " He shuddered . He regards a twenty-block taxi ride as a reckless gamble.  |p133I  had n't been to the West Coast for several years . I slept most of the night but woke up when the stewardess brought morning coffee and then kept my eyes open for a look down at the country . There is no question that a desert landscape is neater than where things have simply got to grow , and of course they do n't have the weed problem , but from up above I saw stretches where even a few good big weeds would have been a help . My watch said 11:10 as the plane taxied to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I set it back to ten past eight before I arose and filed out to the gangway and off . It was warm and muggy , with no sign of the sun . By the time I got my suitcase and found a taxi I had to use a handkerchief on my face and neck . Then the breeze through the open window came at me , and , not wanting to get pneumonia in a foreign country , I shut the window . The people did n't look as foreign as some of the architectureand most of the vegetation . Before we got to the hotel it started to rain . I had a regulation breakfast and then went up and had a regulation bath . My room  --  it was the Riviera  --  had too many colors scattered around but was okay . It smelled swampy , but I could n't open a window on account of the rain . When I was through bathing and shaving and dressingand unpacking it was after eleven , and I got at thep134phone and asked Information for the number of Clarence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the number , and after three whirs a female voice told my ear hello . I was friendly but not sugary . " May I speak to Mrs. Clarence Potter , please ? " " This is Mrs. Potter . " Her voice was high but not squeaky . " Mrs. Potter , my name is Thompson , George Thompson . I 'm from New York , and you never heard of me . I 'm here on a business trip , and I would like to see you to discuss an important matter . Any time that will suit you will suit me , but the sooner the better . I 'm talking from the Riviera Hotel and I can come out now if that will be convenient . " " Did you say Thompson ? " " That 's right , George Thompson . " " But why do you  --  what 's it about ? " " It 's a personal matter . I 'm not selling anything . It 's something I need to know about your deceased brother , Leonard Dykes , and it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd appreciate it if I could see you to-day . " " What do you want to know about my brother ? " " It 's a little too complicated for the telephone . Why not let me come and tell you about it ? " " Well , I suppose  --  all right . I 'll be home until three o'clock . " " Fine . I 'll leave right away . " I did so . All I had to do was grab my hat and raincoat and go . But down in the lobby I was delayed . As I was heading for the front a voice called Mr. Thompson , and with my mind on my errand I nearly muffed it . Then Ip135reined and turned and saw the clerk handing a bellboy a yellow envelope . " Telegram for you , Mr. Thompson . " I crossed and got it and tore it open . It said , " CONFOUND IT DID YOU ARRIVE SAFELY OR NOT . " I went out and climbed into a taxi and told the driver we were bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , When he pulled up in front of one I went into a phone booth and sent a wire : " Arrived intact am on my way to appointment with subject . " During the thirty-minute drive to Glendale it rained approximately three-quarters of an inch . Whitecrest Avenuewas so new it had n't been paved yet , and Number 2819 was out almost at the end , with some giant sagebrush just beyond , hanging on the edge of a gully , only I suppose it was n't sagebrush . There were two saggy palms and another sort of a tree in the front yard . The driver stopped at the edge of the road in front , with the right wheels in four inches of rushing water in the gutter , and announced , " Here we are . " " Yeah , " I agreed , " but I 'm not a Seabee . If you do n't mind turning in ? " He muttered something , backed up for an approach , swung into the ruts of what was intended for a driveway , and came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big pink box with maroon piping . Having already told him he was n't expected to wait , I paid him , got out , and made a dive for the door , which was protected from the elements by an overhang about the size of a card table . As I pushed the button a three-by-six panel a little below the level of my eyes slid aside , leaving an opening through which a voice came.  | " Mr. George Thompson ? " " That 's me . Mrs. Potter ? " " Yes . I 'm sorry , Mr. Thompson , but I phoned my husbandwhat you said , and he said I should n't let a stranger in , you see it 's so remote here , so if you 'll just tell me what you want . . . " Outside the raincoat the pouring rain was slanting in at me , amused at the card-table cover . Inside the raincoat there was almost as much dampness as outside , from sweat . I would n't have called the situation desperate , but it did need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through that hole ? " " Oh , yes . That 's what it 's for . " " How do I look ? " There was a noise that could have been a giggle . " You look wet . " " I mean do I look depraved ? " " No . No , you really do n't . " Actually I was pleased . I had come three thousand miles to pull a fast one on this Mrs. Potter , and if she had received me with open arms I would have had to swallow scruples . Now , being kept standing out in that cloudburst on a husband 's orders , I felt no qualms . " Look , " I offered , " here 's a suggestion . I 'm a literary agent from New York , and this will take us at least twenty minutes and maybe more . Go to the phone and call up some friend , preferably nearby . Tell her to hold the wire , come and unlock the door , and run back to the phone . Tell the friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room from you . If I make a move you 'll have your friend right there on the phone . How will that do ? "  | " Well  --  we just moved here a month ago and my nearest friend is miles away . " " Okay . Have you got a kitchen stool ? " " A kitchen stool ? Certainly . " " Go get it to sit on and we 'll talk through the hole . " The noise that could have been a giggle was repeated . Then came the sound of a turned lock , and the door swung open . " This is silly , " she said defiantly . " Come on in . " I crossed the threshold and was in a small foyer . She stood holding the door , looking brave . I took my raincoat off . She closed the door , opened a closet door and got a hanger , draped the dripping coat on it , and hooked it on the corner of the closet door . I hung my hat on the same corner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right , and I turned a corner into a big room that was mostly glass on one side , with glass doors , closed , to the outdoors at the far end . At the other end was a phony fireplace with phony logs glowing . The red and white and yellow rugs were matched by the cushions on the wicker furniture , and a table with books and magazines had a glass top . She invited me to sit , and I did so . She stood far enough off so that I would have had to make three good bounds to grab her , and it is only fair to say that it might have been worth the effort . She was three inches shorter , some years older , and at least ten pounds plumper than my ideal for grabbing , but with her dark twinkling eyes in her round little face she was by no means homely . " If you 're wet , " she said , " move over by the fire . " " Thanks , this is all right . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining . "  | " Yes , we think we 'll like it very much . " She sat down on the edge of a chair with her feet drawn back , maintainingher distance . " Do you know why I let you in ? Your ears . I go by ears . Did you know my brother Len ? " " No , I never met him . " I crossed my legs and leaned back , as evidence that I was n't gathered for a pounce . " I 'm much obliged to my ears for getting me in out of the rain . I believe I told you I 'm a literary agent , did n't I ? " " Yes . " " The reason I had to see you , I understand you were your brother 's only heir . He left everything to your ' " Yes . " She moved back in her chair a little . " That 's how we bought this place . It 's all paid for , cash , no mortgage . " " That 's fine . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes out . The idea is this , Mrs. Potter , since you were the sole legatee under your brother 's will everything he had belongs to you . And I 'm interested in something that I think he had  --  no , do n't be alarmed , it 's nothing that you 've already used . Possibly you 've never even heard of it . When did you last see your brother ? " " Why , six years ago . I never saw him after nineteen forty-five , when I got married and came to California . " She flushed a little . " I did n't go back when he died , to the funeral , because we could n't afford it . I would have gone if I had known he had left me all that money and bonds , but I did n't know that until afterwards . " " Did you correspond ? Did you get letters from him ? " She nodded . " We always wrote once a month , sometimesoftener . " " Did he ever mention that he had written a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? " " Why , no . " Suddenly she frowned . " Wait a minute , nowp139maybe he did . " She hesitated . " You see , Len was always thinking he was going to do something important , but I do n't think he ever told anyone but me . After father and mother died I was all he had , and I was younger than him . He did n't want me to get married , and for a while he did n't write , he did n't answer my letters , but then he did , and he wrote long letters , pages and pages . Why , did he write a book ? " " Have you kept his letters ? " " Yes , I  --  I kept them . " " Have you still got them ? " " Yes . But I think you ought to tell me what you want . " " So do I. " I folded my arms and regarded her , her round little honest face . In out of the rain , I was feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to decide whether to trick her or let her in on it  --  a vital point , which Wolfe had left to my own judgment after meeting her . I looked at her face , with the twinkle gone from her eyes , and decided . If it came out wrong I could kick myself back to New York instead of taking a plane . " Listen , Mrs. Potter . Will you listen carefully , please ? " " Of course I will . " " Okay . This is what I was going to tell you . It 's not what I am telling you , only what I intended to . I 'm George Thompson , a literary agent . I have in my possession a copy of a manuscript of a novel entitled Put Not Your Trust , ' written by Baird Archer . But I have reason to believe that Baird Archer was a pen name used by your brother , that your brother wrote the novel  --  but I 'm not sure about it . I also have reason to believe that I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a good price , around fifty thousand dollars . You are your brother 's sole heir . I want ,  |p140with  you , to go through the letters your brother wrote you , looking for evidence that he wrote or was writing the novel . Whether we find such evidence or not , I want to deposit the manuscript in the vault of a local bank for safekeeping , and I want you to write a letter to a certain law firm in New York , the firm your brother worked for . In the letter I want you to say that you have a copy of the manuscript of a novel written by your brother under the name of Baird Archer , giving the title of the novel , that an agent named Thompson thinks he can sell it to the movies for fifty thousand dollars , and that you want their legal advice in the matter because you do n't know how such things should be done . I also want you to say that Thompson has read the manuscript but you have not . Get that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was wide-eyed . It did n't alter my opinion of her . A prospect of fifty thousand unexpectedbucks is enough to open eyes , no matter how honest they are . She added , " If it 's my property I can just tell you to sell it , ca n't I ? " " You see , " I reproached her , " you did n't listen . " I did  --  too ! I lis  --  " " No . You did not . I warned you that that was only what I intended to tell you . There was some truth in it , but darned little . I do think that your brother wrote a novel of that title under the name of Baird Archer , and I would like to go through his letters to see if he mentioned it , but I have no copy of the manuscript , there is no prospect of selling it to the movies , I am not a literary agent , and my name is not George Thompson . Now , having  --  " " Then it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  "  |p141She  was out of her chair . " Who are you ? What 's your name ? " " Have my ears changed any ? " I demanded . " What do you want ? " " I want you to listen . It was n't a lie if I did n't say it , even if I intended to . Now here 's what I do say , and it 's the truth . You might as well sit down , because this is even longer . " " She sat , but on about a third of the chair seat . " My name , " I said , " is Archie Goodwin . I 'm a private detective , and I work for Nero Wolfe , also a private de-ter --  " " Nero Wolfe ! " " Right . It will please him to know that you had heard of him , and I 'll be sure to tell him . He has been hired by a man named Wellman to find out who murdered his daughter . And another girl has been murdered , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother was murdered . We have reason to believe that the same person committed all three murders . It 's a long and complicated reason , and I 'll skip it . If you want the details later you can have them . I 'll just say that our theory is that your brother was killed because he wrote that novel , Joan Wellmanwas killed because she had read it , and Rachel Abrams was killed because she had typed it . " " The novel  --  Len wrote ? " " Yes . Do n't ask me what was in it , because we do n't know . If we did , I would n't have had to come out here to see you . I came to get you to help us catch a man that murdered three people , and one of them was your brother . " " But I ca n't  --  " She gulped . " How can I help ? " " I 'm telling you . I could have tricked you into helping.  |p142I  've just proved it . You would have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know darned well you would . You 'd have let me go through your brother 's letters for evidence , and whether we found it or not you 'd have written the letter to the law firm . That 's all I 'm asking you to do , only now I 'm giving it to you straight and asking you to do it not for a pile of dough but to help catch the man that killed your brother . If you would have done it for money , and you would , do n't you think you ought to do it to bring a murderer to justice ? " She was frowning , concentrating . " But I do n't see  --  You only want me to write a letter ? " " That 's right . It 's like this . We think your brother wrote that novel , and it was a vital element in the murders . We think that someone in that law office is involved and either committed the murders or knows who did . We think that someone is desperately determined that the contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . If we 're right , and you send the kind of letter I described , he 'll have to move and move quick , and that 's all we need , to start him moving . If we 're wrong , your sending the letter will do nobody any harm . " She was keeping the frown . " What did you say you wanted me to say in the letter ? " I repeated it , with fuller detail . Toward the end she began slowly shaking her head . When I stopped she spoke . " But that would be a lie  --  saying you have a copy of the manuscript when you have n't . I could n't tell them a deliberate lie ! " " Maybe not , " I said regretfully . " If you 're the kind of person who has never told a lie in all your life , I ca n't expect you to tell one just to help find the man who killedp143your brother  --  and who also killed two young women , ran a car over one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if it could n't possibly hurt any innocent person , I would n't want to urge you to tell your very first lie . " " You do n't have to be sarcastic . " Her face had turned a mild pink . " I did n't say I never told a lie . I 'm no angel . You 're perfectly right , I would have done it for the money , only then I would n't have known it was a lie . " Suddenly her eyes twinkled . " Why do n't we start over and do it the other way ? " I would have liked to give her a good hug . " Listen , " I suggested , " let 's take things in order . We 've got to go through his letters first anyhow , there 's no objection to that , then we can decide on the next step . You get the letters , huh ? " " I guess so . " She arose . " They 're in a box in the garage . " " Can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left me . I got up and crossed to a window to look out at the California climate . I would have thought it was beautiful if I had been a seal . It would be beautiful anyway if one of Dykes 's letters had what I was after . I was n't asking for anything elaborate like an outline of the plot ; just one little sentence would do . When she came back , sooner than I expected , she had two bundles of white envelopes in her hands , tied with string . She put them down on the glass-topped table , sat , and pulled the end of a bowknot . I approached . " Start about a year ago . Say March of last year . " I pulled a chair up . " Here , give me some . " She shook her head . " I 'll do it . "  | " You might miss it . It might be just a vague reference . " " I wo n't miss it . I could n't let you read my brother 's letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Excuse me . Mr. Goodwin . " She was looking at postmarks . Evidently she meant it , and I decided to table my motion , at least temporarily . Meanwhile I could do a job . I got out my notebook and pen and started writing at the top of a sheet : Corrigan , Phelps , Kustin &; Briggs522 Madison AvenueNew York , N. Y.Gentlemen : I am writing to ask your advice because my brother worked for you for many years up to the time of his death . His name was Leonard Dykes . I am his sister and in his will he left everything to me , but I suppose you know that . A man named Walter Finch has just been to see me . He says he is a literary agent . Ile says that last year my brother wrote a novel . I stopped to consider . Mrs. Potter was reading a letter , with her teeth clamped on her lower lip . Well , I thought , I can put it in , and it will be easy enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumed with my pen : I already knewthat because my brother mentioned it once in a letter , but that was all I knew about it . Mr. Finch says he has a copy of the manuscript and its title is " Put Not Your Trust , " and my brother put the name of Baird Archer on it as the author , but my brother really wrote it . FIep145says he thinks that he can sell it to the movies for $50,000.00 , and he says since my brother left everything to me I am the legal owner of it and he wants me to sign a paper that he is my agent and I will pay him 10 per cent of what he gets for it from the movies . I am writing to you air mail because it is a big sum of money and I know you will give me good advice . I do n't know any lawyer here that I know I can trust . I want to know if the 10 per cent is all right and should I sign the paper . Another thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manuscript except just the envelope he has it in and he wo n't leave it with me , and it seems to me I ought to see it and read it if I am going to sell it because I ought to know what I am selling . Please answer by air mail because Mr. Finch says it is urgent and we must act quick . Thankingyou very much . Sincerely yours , It did n't come out that way all at once . I did a lot of crossing out and changing , and the preceding was the final result , of which I made a clear copy . I read it over and passed it . There was the one sentence that might have to come out , but I hoped to God it would n't . My accomplice was reading steadily , and I had kept an eye on her progress . There were four envelopes in a little stack at her right , finished , and if she had started with March and he had written one a month , she was up to July . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat and controlled them until she finished another one and began folding it for return to the envelope , and then got up to take a walk . She was reading so damn slow . I crossed to the glass doors at the far end of the room and lookedp146out . In the rain a newly planted tree about twice my height was slanting to one side , and I decided to worry about that but could n't get my mind on it . I got stubborn and determined that I damn well was going to worry about that tree , and was fighting it out when suddenly her voice came . " I knew there was something ! Here it is . Listen ! " I wheeled and strode . She read it out . " Here is something just for you , Peggy dear . So many things have been just for you all my life . I was n't going to tell even you about this , but now it 's finished and I have to . I have written a novel ! Its title is " Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be publishedunder my name and I have to use a nom de plume , but that wo n't matter much if you know , so I 'm telling you . I have every confidence that it will be published , since I am by no means a duffer when it comes to using the English language . But this is strictly for you alone . You must n't even tell your husband about it . " Mrs. Potter looked up at me , at her elbow . " There ! I had forgotten that he mentioned the title , but I knew  --  no ! What are you  --  " She made a quick grab , but not quick enough . I had finally pounced . With my left hand I had snatched the letter from her fingers , and with my right the envelope from the table , and then backed off out of reach . " Take it easy , " I told her . " I 'd go through fire for you and I 've already gone through water , but this letter goes home with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your brother wrote that novel . I 'd rather have this letter than one from Elizabeth Taylor begging me to let her holdp147my hand . If there 's anything in it that you do n't want read in a courtroom that part wo n't be read , but I need it all , including the envelope . If I had to I would knock you down and walk on you to get out of here with it . You 'd better take another look at my ears . " She was indignant . " You did n't have to grab it like that . " " Okay , I was impulsive and I apologize . I 'll give it back , and you can hand it to me , with the understanding that if you refuse I 'll take it by force . " Her eyes twinkled , and she knew it , and flushed a little . She extended a hand . I folded the letter , put it in the envelope , and handed it to her . She looked at it , glanced at me , held it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing this , " she said gravely , " because I think my brother would want me to . Poor Len . You think he was killed because he wrote that novel ? " " Yes . Now I know it . It 's up to you whether we get the guy that killed him . " I got out my notebook , tore out a sheet , and handed it to her . " All you have to do is write that letter on your own paper . Maybe not quite all . I 'll tell you the rest . " She started to read it . I sat down . She looked beautiful . The phony logs in the phony fireplace looked beautiful . Even the pouring rain  --  but no , I wo n't overdo it.  |p148I  phoned Wolfe at 3:23 from a booth in a drugstore somewhere in Glendale . It is always a pleasure to hear him say " Satisfactory " when I have reported on an errand . This time he did better . When I had given him all of it that he needed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pocket and the one written by Mrs. Potterthat I had just put an air-mail stamp on and dropped in the slot at the Glendale Post Office , there was a five-secondsilence and then an emphatic " Very satisfactory . " After another five bucks ' worth of discussion of plans for the future , covering contingencies as well as possible , I dove through the rain to my waiting taxi and gave the driver an address in downtown Los Angeles . It rained all the way . At an intersection we missed colliding with a truck by an eighth of an inch , and the driver apologized , saying he was n't used to driving in the rain . I said he soon would be , and he resented it . The office of the Southwest Agency was on the ninth floor of a dingy old building with elevators that groaned and creaked . It occupied half the floor . I had been there once before , years back , and , having phoned that morningfrom the hotel that I would probably be dropping in , I was more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferdinand Dolman , with two chins , and fourteenlong brown hairs deployed across a bald top , arose top149shake hands and exclaim heartily , " Well , well ! Nice to see you again ! How 's the old fatty ? " Few people know Nero Wolfe well enough to call him the old fatty , and this Dolman was not one of them , but it was n't worth the trouble to try to teach him manners , so I skipped it . I exchanged words with him enough to make it sociable and then told him what I wanted . " I 've got just the man for you , " he declared . " He happens to be here right now , just finished a very difficult job . This is a break for you , it really is . " He picked up a phone and told it , " Send Gibson in . " In a minute the door opened and a man entered and approached . I gave him one look , and one was enough . He had a cauliflower ear , and his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Dolman started to speak , but I beat him to it . " No , " I said emphatically , " not the type . Not a chance . " Gibson grinned . Dolman told him he could go , and he did so . When the door had closed behind him I got candid . " You 've got a nerve , trotting in that self-made ape . If he just did a difficult job I 'd hate to see who does your easy ones . I want a man who is educated or can talk like it , not too young and not too old , sharp and quick , able to take on a bushel of new facts and have them ready for use . " Jesus . " Dolman clasped his hands behind his head . " J. Edgar Hoover maybe ? " " I do n't care what his name is , but if you have n't got one like that , say so , and I 'll go shopping . " " Certainly we 've got one . With over fifty men on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Show him to me. "  |p150He  finally did , I admit that , but not until after I had hung around for more than five hours and had interviewed a dozen prospects . I also admit I was being finicky , especiallysince there was a good chance that all he would ever do was collect his twenty a day and expenses , but after getting it set up as I had I did n't want to run a risk of having it bitched up by some little stumble . The one I picked was about my age , named Nathan Harris . His face was all bones and his fingers were all knuckles , and if I knew anything about eyes he would do . I did n't go by ears , like Peggy Potter . I took him to my room at the Riviera . We ate in the room , and I kept him there , briefing him , until two in the morning . He was to go home and get some luggage and register at the South Seas Hotel under the name of Walter Finch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I let him make notes all he wanted , with the understanding that he was to have it all in his head by the time it might be needed , which could be never . One decisionI made was to tell him only what Walter Finch , the literary agent , might be expected to know , not to hold out on him but to keep from cluttering his mind , so when he left he had never heard the names of Joan Wellman or Rachel Abrams , or Corrigan , Phelps , Kustin and Briggs . Going to bed , I opened the window three inches at the bottom , and in the morning there was a pool that reached to the edge of the rug . I got my wristwatch from the bedstandand saw 9:20 , which meant 12:20 in New York . At the Glendale Post Office they had told me that the letter would make a plane which would land at La Guardia at eight in the morning New York time , so it should be de/livered at Madison Avenue any time now , possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my worries was Mr. Clarence Potter . Mrs. Potter had assured me that her husband would n't try to interfere , whether he approved or not , but it tied a knot in me , especially with an empty stomach , to think of the damage he could do with a telegram to Corrigan , Phelps , Kustin and Briggs . It was too much for me . Before I even shut the window or went to the bathroom I called the Glendale number . Her voice answered . " Good morning , Mrs. Potter . This is Archie Goodwin . I was just wondering  --  did you tell your husband about it ? " " Yes , of course . I told you I was going to . " " I know you did . How did he take it ? Should I see him ? " " No , I do n't think so . He does n't quite understand it . I explained that you have no copy of the manuscript and there does n't seem to be one anywhere , but he thinks we should try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movie studio . I told him we should wait for an answer to my letter , and he agreed . I 'm sure he 'll understand when he thinks it over . " " Of course he will . Now about Walter Finch . I 've got him , and he 's in his room at the South Seas . He 's a little taller than average , and you 'd probably guess him at thirty-five . He has a bony face , and bony hands with long fingers , and dark brown eyes that you might call black . He looks straight at you when he talks , and his voice is a medium baritone , you 'd like it . Do you want to write that down ? " " I do n't need to . " " Sure you 've got it ? "  | " Yes . " " I believe you . I 'll be in my room at the Riviera all day . Call me any time if anything happens . " " All right , I will . " There 's a loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She knows damn well she 's married to a dumbbell , but by gum she 'll never say so . I phoned down for breakfast and newspapers , washed and brushed my teeth , and ate in my pajamas . Then I called the South Seas Hotel and asked for Walter Finch . He was there in his room , 1216 , and said he was getting along fine with his homework . I told him to stay put until further notice . When I had showered and shaved and dressed , and finished with the newspapers and looked out at the rain some , I phoned down for magazines . I refused to let myselfstart listening for the phone to ring because it might be all day and night and into another day before there was a peep , and it would n't help to wear my nerves out . However , I did look at my watch fairly often , translating it into New York time , as I gave the magazines a play . Eleven-fifty meant two-fifty . Twelve-twenty-five meant three-twenty-five . Four minutes after one meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nearing the end of the office day . I tossed a magazine aside and went to a window to admire the rain again , then called room service and ordered lunch . I was chewing a bite of albacore steak when the phone rang . To show how composed I was , I finished chewing and swallowing before I picked it up . It was Mrs. Potter . " Mr. Goodwin ! I just had a phone call ! From Mr. Cor-rigan ! "  |p153I  was glad I had finished swallowing . " Fine ! What did he say ? " " He wanted to know all about Mr. Finch . I said just what you told me to . " She was talking too fast , but I did n't interrupt . " He asked where the manuscript is , and I told him Mr. Finch has it . He asked if I had seen it or read it , and I said no . He told me not to sign any paper or agree to anything until he has seen me . He 's taking a plane in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight in the morning and he 's coming right here to see me . " It was a funny thing . I was swallowing albacore , although I would have sworn that it was already down . It tasted good . " Did he sound as if he suspected anything ? " " He did not ! I did it perfectly ! " " I 'm sure you did . If I was there I 'd pat you on the head . I might even go further than that , so it 's just as well I 'm not there . Do you want me to come out and go over it again ? What you 'll say to him ? " " I do n't think it 's necessary . I remember everything . " " Okay . He 'll want to get to Finch as soon as possible , but he may ask you a lot of questions . What do you say if he asks to see the letter from your brother in which he mentioned writing a novel ? " " I say I have n't got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right . He 'll probably get to your place around nine o'clock . What time does your husband leave ? " " Twenty minutes past seven . " " Well . It 's a million to one that you 'll be in no danger , even if he 's a killer , since he knows you have never seen the manuscript , but we ca n't take a chance . I ca n't bep154there myself because I have to be in Finch 's room before he gets there . Now listen . At eight in the morning a man will come and show you his credentials from the SouthwestAgency , a detective agency . Hide him where he can hear what goes on , but be darned sure he 's well hid . Keep him  --  " " No , that 's silly ! Nothing 's going to happen to me ! " " You bet it is n't . Three murders is enough for one manuscript . He 'll be there , and you  --  " " My husband can take the morning off and stay home . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your talk with Corrigan is going to be ticklish to handle , and we do n't want anyonejoining in , not even your husband . A man will come with credentials , and you 'll let him in and hide him and keep him there until an hour after Corrigan has left . Either that or I come myself , and that would ball it up . What hotel is Finch at ? " " The South Seas . " " Describe him . " " He 's rather tall , in his thirties , with a bony face and hands and dark eyes , and he looks straight at you when he talks . " " Right . For God 's sake do n't get careless and describe me . Remember it was Finch who came to see you  --  " " Really , Mr. Goodwin ! If you have no confidence in me ! " " I have . I sure have . " " Well , you 'd better ! " " I had indeed better . I 'll be out part of the afternoon . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Potter . " " Good luck to you too . " The albacore had cooled off some , but it was good , andp155I finished it . I felt wonderful . I called Finch at the South Seas and told him we had had a bite and had a fish on the hook , and it might be the big one , and I would drop in on him at eight in the morning . He said he was all set . I lifted the receiver to put in a call to New York , then replacedit . It was goofy to suppose there could be any risk in George Thompson 's calling Nero Wolfe 's number , but I 'd rather be goofy than sorry . Taking my raincoat and hat , I went down to the lobby , out into the rain , and to a drugstore in the next block . There I made the call from a booth . When I got Wolfe and reported the development , he grunted across the continent , and that was all . He had no additional instructions or suggestions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at something important like a crossword puzzle . I only half drowned finding a taxi to take me to the addressof the Southwest Agency . With Dolman I did n't have to be as choosy as the day before , since any mug should be able to keep a man from killing a woman right under his nose , but even so I did n't want any part of Gibsonor one like him . He produced a fairly good specimen , and I gave him careful and fully detailed instructions and made him repeat them . From there I went to the South Seas Hotel for a surprise call on Finch , thinking it just as well to check him and also to have a look at the room . He was lying on the bed , reading a book entitled Twilight of the Absolute , which seemed a deep dive for a dick , but then , as Finch , he was a literary agent , so I refrained from comment . The room was perfect , of medium size , with the door to the bathroom in the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side . I did n't stay long because my nerves were jumpy away from the phone in my roomp156at the Riviera . If anything happened I wanted to know it quick . For instance , Clarence Potter would soon be home from work , or was already . What if he did n't understand it some more and decided to take a hand ? But at bedtime the phone had n't let out a tinkle.  |p157At  8:02 Thursday morning I entered Finch 's room at the South Seas . He was up and dressed but had n't had breakfast , and I had only had orange juice before leaving the Riviera . Hanging my hat and raincoat , which had been sprinkled again , in the rear of the big closet , I gave him my order : griddle cakes , ham and eggs , a jar of honey , and coffee . He relayed it to room service , his own requirements being prunes and toast and coffee , which made me dart a glance at him , but he looked okay . When he was through I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an answer after four whirrs . " Archie Goodwin , Mrs. Potter . Good morning . Did the man come ? " " Yes , he got here ten minutes ago . He 'll hide in the kitchen . You know I 'm all excited ? " " Sure , that 's all right . It wo n't matter if it shows ; Corriganwill think it 's the prospect of fifty thousand bucks . Just take it easy . Do you want to ask anything ? " " No , not a thing . " " Good for you . I 'm in Finch 's room at the South Seas . Ring me if you need to , and of course when he leaves . " She said she would . I hung up and called the airport . The plane from New York , due at eight o'clock , had landed at 7:50 , ten minutes early . The cuisine at the South Seas was n't as good as the Riviera , but I cleaned up my share . When we had finishedp158we wheeled the breakfast table into the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harris , Finch to you , wanted to make it , but my point was that it would be unrealistic because no literary agent would have got up early enough to leave the room free for the chambermaidat that hour , and he had to concede it . He raised the question of whether I would stand in the closet or sit , and I said I would stand because no chair can be trusted not to squeak with a shift of weight . We had just got that settled when the phone rang . I was seated by it , but told Finch to take it and moved . He went and got it . " Hello . . . . This is Walter Finch speaking . . . . Yes , I talked with Mrs. Potter . . . . That 's right . . . . No , I did n't know she had written you , Mr. Corrigan , I only knew she had written for advice .... Yes , but may I speak to her , please ? " Pause . " Yes , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to see me , representing you about that manuscript . . . . Oh , I see . . . . Yes , I understand . . . Certainly , I 'll consult you before any agreement is made . . . . Please put him on . " Pause . " Yes , I understand , Mr. Corrigan . . . . No , that 's all right , I 'm perfectly willing to discuss it . . . . Yes , if you come right away . I have an appointment at eleven . . . . Room Twelve-sixteen , the South Seas . . . . All right , I 'll be here . " He hung up and turned to me with a grin . " Got a landingnet ? " " No , a gaff . What was the hitch ? " " Nothing serious . He seemed to think he had a client ,  |p159but  she did n't agree . He 's coming on his own , to protect the lowly , without prejudice to her . " " If you want me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's wrong with our civilization . " " I want you to . What ? " " We 've quit drinking champagne from ladies ' slippers . I would like to drink some from hers . " I sat , bent and untied my laces and took off my shoes , took them to the closet , and put them on the floor out of the way . In my socks I hopped around on the spot where I would be standing , and heard no squeaks . As I rejoined Finch the phone rang . He got it , spoke , covered the transmitter , and told me , " Mrs. Potter . She wants to know what color slippers you prefer . " I went and took it . " Yes , Mrs. Potter ? Archie Goodwin . " Why , he was n't here more than ten minutes ! He hardly asked me anything ! He asked about Mr. Finch , and the letter from my brother , and then he wanted me to say he could represent me as my attorney , and I said what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Finch he tried to make it that he was representing me . I was hoping he would ask more things , the things you said he might ask , but he did n't . There 's really nothing to tell you , but I 'm calling because I said I would . " " He 's gone ? " " Yes , he had his taxi wait for him . " " Well , your part is probably finished , and you can let your bodyguard go if you want to . I was just telling Mr. Finch that I would like to drink champagne from your slipper . " " You what ? What did you say ? "  | " You hard me . Too late . I 'll let you know what happens , and you let me know if you hear from him again  --  immediately . " " I will . " I hung up and turned to Finch . " We 've got about twenty minutes . What do you want refreshed ? " " Nothing . I 've got it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat . " I could fill you in on Corrigan now , but I still think it 's better not to . I 'll say this , I am now offering three to one that he 's a killer , and if so he 's in a damn tight corner with his teeth showing . I do n't see how he can possibly jump you under the circumstances , but if he does do n't count on me . I wo n't leave that closet for anything short of murder . If he actuallykills you , yell . " " Thanks . " He grinned at me . But he slipped his hand inside his coat to his armpit , came out with a gun , and dropped it into his side pocket . Finch had given Corrigan the room number , and he might phone up from the lobby and might not . Also there was no telling how fast his driver was , and it would be too bad if Corrigan arrived sooner than expected , came straight up to the room , paused at the door , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . I was leaning back , studying the ceiling , when the knock came , and it did n't sound like a chambermaid . I straightened up and left the chair in one motion , and Finch started for the door . Before he reached it I was in the closet , with the door pulled to enough to leave no crack , but unlatched . The sound of the voice answered one question : it was n't a ringer , it was the senior partner himself . I heard the doorp161closing and the footsteps passing the closet door , and Finch inviting the visitor to take the armchair . Then Corrigan'svoice . " You understand why I 'm here , Mr. Finch . My firm received a letter from Mrs. Potter requesting professional advice . " Finch : " Yes , I understand that . " Corrigan : " According to her , you state that you have in your possession a manuscript of a novel entitled Put Not Your Trust , ' by Baird Archer , and that the author of it was her deceased brother , Leonard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . " I held my breath . Here , right off the bat , was one of the tricky little points I had briefed him on . Finch : " That 's not quite right . I did n't say that I know Dykes was the author . I said I have reason to think he was . " I breathed , not noisily . Corrigan : " May I ask what reason ? " Finch : " A pretty good one . But frankly , Mr. Corrigan , I do n't see why I should let you cross-examine me . You 're not representing Mrs. Potter . You heard what she told me on the phone . Naturally I 'll tell her anything she wants to know , but why you ? " Corrigan : " Well . " A pause . " Other interests than Mrs. Potter 's may be involved . I suppose you know that Dykes was an employee of my law firm ? " Finch : " Yes , I know that . " That was a fumble . He did not know that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have reason to think that Dykeswas the author , I have reason to think that other interestsare involved . Perhaps we can take a short cut and savep162time . Let me see the manuscript . Let me go over it now , in your presence . That will settle it . " Finch : " I 'm afraid I ca n't do that . I do n't own it , you know . " Corrigan : " But you have it . How did you get it ? ' " Finch : " Properly and legitimately , in the course of my business as a literary agent . " Corrigan : " You 're not listed in the New York phone book . Two agents who were asked have never heard of you . Finch : " Then you should n't be wasting time on me . Really , Mr. Corrigan , this is n't Russia and you 're not the MVD . Are you ? " Corrigan : " No . What harm could it possibly do anyone for you to let me look over that manuscript ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's ordinary businessethics . An agent does n't show his clients ' manuscriptsto just anybody who would like to see them . Of course I 'd gladly show it to you , in fact I 'd be obliged to , if you were representing Mrs. Potter , whom I believe to be the owner of it . But as it is , nothing doing . That 's final . " Corrigan : " In effect I am representing Mrs. Potter . She wrote my firm for advice . She has complete confidence in me . She refuses to engage me as her attorney only because she fears that a New York law firm would charge her a big fee . We would n't . We would charge her nothing . " Finch : " You should tell her that . " Corrigan : " I tried to . People here on the Coast , especiallywomen of her class , have an ingrained suspicion of New Yorkers , you know that . It 's a stupid prejudice , and Mrs. Potter is a stupid woman . " I thought to myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on . " You may wonder why I 'm making so much of this little matter , flying out here , and I 'll tell you . I said other interests may be involved , and I have good reason to think they are  --  important interests . I warn you now , for the record , that you may dangerously compromiseboth yourself and Mrs. Potter . On reliable information believe that that manuscript is libelous . I believe that even in submitting it for sale you are risking severe penalties . I strongly advise you to get competent legal advice on it , and I assure you that I am qualified to give it . I offer it without charge , not through an impulse of benevolence , but to protect the interests I mentioned . Let me see that manuscript ! " Finch : " If I decide I need legal advice I know where to get it . I never saw you before . I 've never heard of you . How do I know what or who you are ? " Corrigan : " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving his chair . " Here . This may satisfy you . Here are  --  What 's the matter ? " More sounds . Finch : " I 'm polite , that 's all . When a visitorstands , I stand . Keep your credentials , Mr. Corrigan . I do n't care how good they are . As far as I 'm concerned you 're a stranger trying to stick his nose into my business , and I 'm not having any . Flying out here because you think a manuscript may be libelous  --  that sounds pretty damn fishy . You 'll see no manuscript that 's in my care . You 'll have to  --  uuhie ! " That 's the best I can do at spelling the sound he made . Other immediate sounds were not spellable at all , though fairly interpretable . One was surely a chair toppling . Another was feet moving heavily and swiftly . Others were grunts . Then came three in a row that were unmistakable :  |p164a  fist or fists landing , and , right after , something that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Get up and try again . " A pause with sound effects . Corrigan : " I lost my head . " Finch : " Not yet . You may next time . Going ? " That ended the dialogue . Corrigan had no exit line that he cared to use . The only sounds that came were footstepsand the opening and closing of the door , then more footsteps and another opening of the door , and , after a wait , its closing and the lock being turned . I stayed put until the closet door swung open without my touching it . Finch stood grinning . " Well ? " he demanded . " You 're on the honors list , " I told him . " This is my lucky week , first Mrs. Potter and now you . Where did you plug him ? " " Two body jabs and one on the side of the neck . " " How did he invite it ? " " He swung first and then tried to lock me . That was n't much , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm hungry . I want some lunch . " " You wo n't get any , not now , unless it 's a sandwich in a taxi . It 's your move . He 'll see that manuscript or bust , and one will get you ten he 's on his way to Mrs. Potter , who he thinks is stupid . You will get there first , if you step on it , and stay there . The address is **31;5823;TOOLONG Avenue , Glendale . I 'll phone her . Get going ! " " But what  --  " " Scoot , damn it ! Write me a letter . " He moved . He got hat and raincoat from the closet and was gone . I uprighted the chair that had toppled , straight/ened a rug , went to the closet for my shoes , and put them on . Then I sat in the armchair by the phone and called the Glendale number . " Mrs. Potter ? Archie Goo  --  " " Did he come ? " " He did . I hid in the closet while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from law school to see that manuscript . When he saw there was nothing doing he tried to lay Finch out and got knocked down . He left in a hurry , and I 'm giving ten to one that he 's on his way to you , so I sent Finch and I 'm hoping he 'll get there before Corrigandoes . What  --  " " Really , Mr. Goodwin , I 'm not afraid ! " " Do n't I know it . But Corrigan will bear down hard for you to name him your counsel , and it will take most of the pressure off if Finch is there . Anyway , I think you 'll like Finch , he 's not coarse and crude like me . You may have to give him some lunch . If you make Corrigan your attorney , no matter what he says , I 'll come and throw rocks through your windows . " " That would be coarse and crude , would n't it ? I honestlythink you have no confidence in me at all . " " Little you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Finch comes , and do n't forget Finch has been there before . " " I wo n't . " We hung up . Going to a window and seeing with pleasure that it was raining only about half as hard as it had been , I opened it a good four inches to get some air . I raised the question whether to phone Wolfe and decided to await further developments . Having had no opportunity for a look atp166the morning papers , I phoned down for some , and , when they came , got comfortable . The papers were no damn good , except the sports pages , but I gave them enough of a play to make sure that nothing had happened which requiredmy immediate attention and then picked up Finch 's book , Twilight of the Absolute , and gave it a try . I got the impression that it probably made sense , but I ran across nothing that convinced me that I had been wrong in trying to get along without it . The phone rang . It was Finch . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that he had not acceptedmy offer of ten to one . I agreed . " I know you did n't . He came , did he ? " " Yes . I was in ahead by five minutes . He was surprised to see me and not delighted . He insisted on talking with Mrs. Potter alone , but I listened in from the kitchen with her knowledge and consent . He poured it on about the danger of libel and how it would n't cost her anything for him to read the manuscript and give her his professional advice , and the way he put it , it was hard for her to handle . She could n't brush him off as a stranger , as I had . You should have heard her . " " I would have liked to . What was her line ? " " Simple . She said if there was libel in the manuscript she did n't want to know it and did n't want me to , because then it would n't be right to sell it to the movies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be up to the movie people and surely they have good lawyers . He could n't get it into her head that even so she would be responsible . " " I 'll bet he could n't . Kiss her for me . " " I would n't mind a bit . She is sitting here . Frankly , it was a waste of taxi fare to send me out here . "  | " No . Of course Corrigan has left ? " " Yes . He kept his taxi . " " He may be back . He came to get his hands on that manuscript and he intends to . If he does go back there 's no telling what he 'll try . Stick around . Stay until you hear from me . " " I think Mrs. Potter feels that her husband does n't like the idea of men in the house while he 's away , especially one at a time . " " He would n't , the bubblehead . You stay and do the housework for her . While you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been planted in the back . It 's crooked . I 'll see that you get away before Bubblehead gets home . " He said I 'd better . I stretched out my legs , clasped my hands behind my head , and frowned at my toes . It seemed that a call to Wolfe was in order . As far as I could see it was Corrigan 's move , but Wolfe might have something to suggest besidessitting on my prat waiting for it . On the other hand , I still had room within the framework of my instructions , and if I could think up one that would be worthy of Mrs. Potter I ought to do it . So I sat and invented bright ideas , but none that really shone , and was working away at the fourth or fifth when I became aware of a noise at the door . A key had been inserted and was being turned . As I was shaping the thought that chambermaids should be trained always to knock before entering a room , the door swung open , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw me , of course , but I was n't quick-witted enough to realize instantly that with the light from the window at my back he had n't recognized me , so when he said something like , " Oh , I beg your pardon , the wrong room , " Ip168thought he was showing enough presence of mind for both of us , with some left over . But then he did recognize me and he goggled . Also he gaped . I arose and spoke . " No , this is it . Come on in . " He stood , frozen . " Shut the door and come on in , " I insisted . " You might as well . I was expecting you . Did you think Finch would be fool enough to run off to Glendale and leave the manuscripthere in a drawer unguarded ? " He moved , and I added quickly , " If you dash off I wo n't chase you . I 'll call downstairs , and if necessary I 'll call the cops , and we 'll not only find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't think it 's breaking and entering , but by God it 's something , and I 'll hang it on you . " He hooked his elbow on the edge of the door and swung it . It did n't quite close , and he backed against it until it did . Then he walked on in and stopped at arm 's length . " So you followed me here , " he stated . He was a little hoarse . With his jockey 's physique and prizefighter 's jaw and hungry eyes , he was certainly not imposing . The top of his head was a good inch below my eye level . He repeated it , this time as a question . " You followed me here ? " I shook my head . " I ca n't think of a single question you could ask that I would feel like answering . Nor do I want to ask any , except maybe one : why do n't you call Nero Wolfe and talk it over with him ? Reverse the charge . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sociable . It was probably his knees . " This is persecution , " he said . " Not in the statutes , " I objected . But what you just didp169is , getting a key to another man 's hotel room , whether by bribery or just asking for it . Have you anything to say ? " " No . " " Absolutely nothing ? " " No . " " Are you going to call Mr. Wolfe ? " " No . " " Then I 'll use the phone myself . Excuse me . " I got the phone book , looked up a number , lifted the receiver , and asked for it . A female voice answered , and I gave my name and asked to speak to Mr. Dolman . In a moment he was on . " Dolman ? Archie Goodwin . I 'm in Room Twelve-sixteenat the South Seas Hotel . A man named James A. Corriganis here with me , but will soon be leaving , and I want him tailed right . Send me three good men at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required . He 'll prob  --  " " What the hell , is he there hearing you ? " " Yes , so do n't send Gibson . He 'll probably be moving around , so they should have a car . Step on it , will you ? " I hung up , because I was through and also because Corriganhad already started to move around . He was heading for the door . I got to him , gripped a shoulder and hauled him back , and faced him . He did n't lose his head . " This is assault , " he stated . " Persecution and assault , " I agreed . " How can I prove you entered this room illegally if I let you leave it ? Shall I get the house dick up here ? " He stood , breathing , his hungry eyes on me . I was between him and the door . He turned , went to a chair , and sat . I stayed on my feet.  | " They ca n't get here in less than a quarter of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something ? " Not a word . His big jaw was clamped . I leaned against the closet door and contemplated him . It was nearer half an hour than a quarter before there was a knock on the door . I went and opened it and invited them to enter , and they filed in past me , and I 'll be damned if the third of the trio was n't Gibson . He grinned at me as he went by . Leaving the door open , I detoured around them and took a look . One of them , a wiry little guy with a crooked nose , spoke . " I 'm Phil Buratti . I 'm in charge . " " Good , " I told him . " It 's a straight tailing job . " I jerked a thumb . " This is James A. Corrigan , a lawyer from New York . He 'll be leaving any minute . Since he knows you , keep as close as you like . Report direct to me , here . " Buratti stared at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't lose him . " Gibson let out a guffaw that rattled the windows . Corrigangot up and marched . His direct route to the door was between the trio and me , and he took it . He went on out . The trio did n't move . " Are you , " I demanded , " waiting for the hounds ? " " Loony , " Buratti said . " Come on , boys . " He led the way , and they followed . I shut the door and went to the armchair and sat . BeforeI phoned Wolfe I wanted to make up my mind how thick I had been to sit there and let Corrigan walk in on me . I looked at my watch and saw 12:20 , which meant 3:20 in New York . I decided that I had probably not been brilliant but there was no point in advertising it , and put in a call . The circuits were busy . Of course it was the worstp171time of day for it , with Los Angeles and Hollywood wanting to get New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast on returning from lunch . I sat , walked back and forth , and sat some more . Every ten or fifteen minutes the operator called to say the circuits were still busy . One o'clock came , and a quarter after . Finally my call got through , and I had Wolfe 's voice . I reported with details . I told him about Corrigan 's visit with Mrs. Potter , his call on Finch at the hotel ending in a little mild violence , his second trip to Glendale , finding Finch there ahead of him , and Finch 's phone call to me . I continued , " When Finch phoned me that Corrigan had left , licked , naturally I figured him to come back to the hotel to get into Finch 's room to look for the manuscript . Covering the door of the room from the outside was n't feasible , since he knew me . I decided to sit tight and welcomehim if he came . He did so , with a key . His seeing me here jolted him , as expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be alone , and nothing was said that would help you any . I phoned Dolman , and he sent two men and an ape with a sense of humor , and when Corrigan left , an hour and ten minutes ago , the three were on his tail . That 's the status quo . " " There 's a man with Mrs. Potter ? " " Yes , I thought I said so . Finch . " " Then there are no new instructions . Stay there . ' " I would like to stick another pin in him . " " You have none to stick . How is the albacore ? " " Marvelous . " " It should be . Call me as necessary . " " Yes , sir . " He hung up . That shows that everything is relative . Ifp172I had admitted that Corrigan 's walking in on me had been a surprise he might have made remarks . Going to the window for a look at the rain , I was reflecting on that point when the phone rang . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he reported . " He came straight here . You said we could keep close , so I was standing right by him when he asked for a seat on the first plane to New York . The best he could do was the TWA that leaves at five o'clock , and he bought a ticket . He 's in a phone booth now , making a call . Do we go to New York with him ? " " No , I guess not . I 'd like to take Gibson along , but he 's probably needed here . Get me a seat on the same plane and wait there for me . I have some errands to do , so do n't get impatient . There 's a faint chance he 's pulling something , so keep an eye on him . " I hung up and then called the Glendale number . ApparentlyI would n't get to see Mrs. Potter again , but at least I could chat with her on the phone.  |p173Somewhere  over New Mexico , or maybe Oklahoma , I decidedit had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corrigan . A later one would have done just as well . As it was , with me in Seat Five and him back of me in Fourteen , I would get no sleep . In such a situation logic is not enough . It certainly would n't have been logical for him to wander by in that crowded plane and jab a knife in me , especially as I had no briefcase or other receptacle big enough to hold the manuscript of a novel , but I was n't going to sleep , and I did n't like his being at my rear . I had a notion to ask him to trade seats but voted it down . It was a long and weary night . At La Guardia Airport , where we landed in the morning on schedule , he was in a bigger hurry than me . He grabbed his bag and trotted out to a taxi . Before getting my suitcaseI went to a booth and phoned Fritz to expect me for breakfast in thirty minutes and mix plenty of batter . As my taxi crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in four days . Wolfe never came downstairs in the morning until after he finished in the plant rooms at eleven o'clock , but Fritz welcomed me home as if I had been gone a year . He met me at the front door , took my suitcase , hung up my hat and coat , escorted me to the kitchen , and put the griddle on . I was perched on a stool drinking orange juice when I heard the elevator , and a moment later Wolfe entered . Hep174was actually breaking a rule . I thought it deserved some recognition and accepted his offer of a handshake . We made appropriate remarks . He sat . The kitchen is the only place on earth where he does n't mind a chair that lets his fanny lap over the sides . I went to my seat at my breakfasttable as Fritz flapped the first cake onto my hot plate . " He looks skinny , " Fritz told Wolfe . Fritz is convinced that without him we would both starve to death in a week . Wolfe nodded in agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Cypripedium Minos . " " Wonderful , " I said with my mouth full . When the bite was down , " I assume you want a report . There 's  --  " " Eat your breakfast . " " I am . Unlike you , I do n't mind business with meals . There 's nothing but fill-in to add to what you already know , except that I came on the same plane as Corrigan , as arranged . At the airport he took his bag and scooted . I presume that with what you 've collected here we 're about ready to jump ? " He snorted . " Where ? On whom ? " " I do n't know . " " Neither do I. When Mr. Wellman first came to see me , eighteen days ago , I assumed that Dykes had written that novel , that he and the two women were killed on account of their knowledge of it , and that someone in that law office was involved . We have validated that assumption , and that 's all . We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my trip to rainy California was a washout . " " By no means . All we could do was force him or them to become visible by movement . All we can do now is continuethe process . We 'll contrive it . "  | " Right after breakfast ? I 've had no sleep . " " We 'll see . Movement once started is hard to stop . " He glanced at the wall clock . " I 'm late . We 'll see . It is satisfactoryto have you back . " He got up and went . I finished breakfast and looked through the morning paper and went to the office . I would n't have been surprised to see a stack of unopened mail , but apparently he had worked his head off during my absence . Bills and other items , out of their envelopes , were neatly arranged on my desk , and the exposed sheet of my desk calendar said March ninth , today . I was touched . I looked over things a little and then took my suitcase and mounted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I 'm up there I always turn the phone extension on , but that time I forgot to . I had unpacked and stripped and showered , and was using my electric shaver , when Fritz appeared at the bathroom door , panting . " The phone , " he said . " Mr. Corrigan wants to speak to Mr. Wolfe . " " Okay . I forgot to turn it on . I 'll get it . " I went and flipped the switch and lifted the receiver . " This is Archie Goodwin . " I expected Mrs. Adams , but it was Corrigan himself . He said curtly that he wished to speak to Wolfe , and I told him Wolfe would n't be available until eleven . He said they wanted an appointment with him , and I asked who wanted it . " I and my associates . " " Would eleven o'clock suit you ? Or it could be eleven-thirty . " " We would prefer eleven o'clock . We 'll be there . " Before I went to finish shaving I buzzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were . Movement once started is hard to stop . The law firm will be here at eleven . " " Ah , " he said . " Contrivance may not be needed . " It was only ten-thirty , and I took my time completing my personal chores . I can dress fast , but I do n't like to have to . When I went downstairs I was ready for anything , includinga two-hour nap , but that would have to wait . They were ten minutes late , so Wolfe was in the office when they arrived . Before any conversation got started I noticed an interesting little item . Off the end of Wolfe 's desk , facing it , the big red leather chair is the most convenientspot for a visitor , and when there are two or more visitors that is obviously the seat for whoever has priority . When that group had been there before , Corrigan , the senior partner , had occupied it , but this time who should pop into it but the white-haired blinking Briggs , Helen Troy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was equally interesting . As they sat , Emmett Phelps , the long-armed six-foot encyclopedia , was nearest me ; Corrigan was next ; then the sleepy-eyed slumpy Louis Kustin , successor to Conroy O'Malley as the firm 's trial man ; and then the disbarred O'Malley with a bitter twist to his mouth . Wolfe 's eyes went from left to right and back again . " Well , gentlemen ? " Three of them spoke at once . " I ca n't converse with bedlam , " Wolfe said testily . Frederick Briggs , in the red leather chair , blinking , took the ball . " At our previous visit , " he said slowly and distinctly , " I came with my associates under protest . On that occasion you were invited to question us . This time wep177have questions to ask you . You may remember that I characterized your methods as unethical and reprehensible , and you justified that criticism when you fabricated a notation on Dykes 's letter of resignation , imitating the handwriting of one of us , and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that action ? " Wolfe 's brows were up . " None , Mr. Briggs . " Briggs blinked furiously . " That is not acceptable . I insist  --  weinsist  --  on an answer . " " Then I 'll give you one . " Wolfe was not aroused . " As you say , the notation was in Mr. Corrigan 's hand . There are three possible explanations of how it was made . One , by Mr. Corrigan himself some time ago . Two , by me recently . Three , by any one of you , including Mr. Corrigan , either before or after I asked to see the letter . The letter was easily accessible , there in your office files . You , sir , ca n't possibly know which explanation is correct , unless you made the notation yourself . Questioned by the police , all of you have denied making it . I deny making it . " Wolfe flipped a hand . " Surely you do n't credit me with a monopolyin mendacity ? " " That 's evasive . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kustin cut in irritably . His sleepy eyes were awake . " I told you , you wo n't get anywhere with that , and there 's no jury to work on even if you knew how to do it . Get to the point . " " He wo n't . " Phelps , the indifferent scholar , was irritated too . " Let Con do it . " O'Malley shook his head . His mouth kept its twist even when he spoke . " Thanks , Emmett , but I 'm disbarred . You forget ? " " Go on , Fred , " Corrigan told his junior  --  not in years.  | " In my opinion , " Briggs maintained , " we should demandan answer on that , but I defer under protest . " He blinked at Wolfe . " To proceed . All five of us , including Mr. O'Malley , have a mutual and common interest , to protect the reputation and welfare of our firm . In that interestwe are indissolubly joined . Your position , openly stated , has been that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuscript of a novel , presumably written by him under an assumed name ; that the manuscript was also a major factor in the deaths of two women ; and that one or more members of this firm have guilty knowledge of the manuscript and therefore , inferentially , of the deaths . Is that correct ? " Wolfe nodded . " It 's badly put , but I 'll pass it . " " Tell your man to take his notebook , and I 'll restate it . " " Damn it , Fred , " Kustin objected , " he accepted it . What more do you want ? Get on . " Briggs blinked at him . " I want to proceed as agreed , without unnecessary interruptions . " He went to Wolfe . " Very well , you accept it . Then the contents of that manuscriptare a vital element in your investigation . Is that true ? " " Yes . " " And therefore the contents of the manuscript are of vital importance to us , the members of the firm , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And therefore , if we were presented with an opportunity to learn the contents of the manuscript it would be natural and proper for us to make every effort to take advantage of it . Is that true ? " Wolfe rubbed his nose . " I do n't want to quibble , butp179though it would indeed be natural , its propriety might be questioned . If to protect legitimate interests , yes . If to shield a criminal , no . " " There is no question of shielding a criminal . " Wolfe shrugged . " If that is stipulated , what you said is true . " " Very well . It was in furtherance of that effort that Mr. Corrigan went to California . It is in furtherance of that effort that we are here now . We do n't know how you managed to anticipate Mr. Corrigan 's effort , but you did . Your man not only got there but got inside of him . Since he succeeded in preventing Mr. Corrigan from seeing the manuscript , it may fairly be assumed that he himself did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now acquainted with its contents . It was you who involved our firm in this affair . It was you who persuaded the police that we were involved . It was you who forged a notation on a letter we sent you  --  " " Withdraw that , " Wolfe snapped . " That wo n't help , Fred , " O'Malley advised him . " Do n't drag it in . " Briggs blinked at him and then at Wolfe . " On considerationI withdraw that remark pro tempore , without prejudice . But that does n't affect my conclusion , that our demand is justified , to be told the substance of that manuscript . You involved us . We demand that you warrant that involvement . " Briggs blinked around . " Well ? " he challenged . " Is that clear and cogent ? " They agreed that it was . Wolfe grunted . " Clear enough , " he assented , " but it took you long enough to say it . You gentlemen are making anp180extraordinary pother , coming here in a body like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone me and ask me to tell you what 's in that manuscript ? It would have taken you five seconds to ask it and me two seconds to answer it . " " What would you have answered ? " Kustin demanded . " That I 'm not quite ready . " " Not quite ready for what ? " " To act . " To appreciate the full effect of those two little words you would have had to hear Wolfe pronounce them . He did n't snarl them or snap them , his voice kept its normal pitch , but if anyone present had anything to fear the full menace of it was in those two calm , precise syllables . They looked at one another . Briggs asked indignantly , " Do you mean you refuse to tell us anything about it ? " Wolfe nodded . " At the moment , yes . I 'm not quite ready . As practicing attorneys , you gentlemen know that the potency of knowledge depends on how and when it is used . I went to some trouble to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Emmett Phelps stood up . " I told you fellows , did n't I ? We 're wasting time on him . " " Mr. Phelps is bored , " Wolfe said dryly . " Buy it from him , " O'Malley suggested . " Make him an offer . It can be deducted as a legitimate expense , ca n't it , Emmett ? " He left his chair . " Only do n't expect me to contribute . I 'm broke . " Wolfe spoke up . " I would like to anticipate any future charge of willful malevolence . I take no pleasure in prolongingsuspense , either my own or another 's . I 'm being completely candid when I say that I still need a fact orp181two before I can act . To move not fully prepared , to disclosemyself prematurely , would be folly , and I 'm not afool . " ! Dustin got to his feet , stepped to the desk , put his hands on it , and leaned forward at Wolfe . " I 'll tell you what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think you know any more about that manuscript than we do . I think you 're exactly where you were when we came here a week ago yesterday . " He straightened up . " Come on , fellows . He 's a goddam fourflusher . " He whirled to me . " You too , Goodwin . I wish I 'd gone to California instead of Jim Corrigan . You 'd have been called . " He marched out . Phelps and O'Malley were at his heels . Corrigan , who had said practically nothing , thought he would speak now , took a step toward the desk , but changed his mind and , with a glance at me , headed for the door . Briggs lifted himself out of the red leather chair , blinkedat Wolfe , said , " My appraisal of your methods and tactics has certainly been reinforced here today , " and turned and went . I moseyed to the door to the hall , stood on the sill , and watched them wriggling into their coats . I was perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the door open before I moved , and held it for them , so I was saved the trouble . He banged it hard enough to leave no doubt of its closing , and I wheeled , returned to my desk , andpermitted myself an all-out yawn . Wolfe was leaning back with his eyes shut . " Will there be more movement ? " I inquired . " Or is ittime for a contrivance ? " No reply . I yawned again . " Once in a while , " I observed , " you go right to the heart of things and tell a plain unvar/nished truth . Like when you said that you still need a fact or two before you can act . It might be objected that you need more than one or two , but that is n't so . The one fact that Phelps , the scholar , is a lover of literature and bumped them off because it was a lousy novel and he could n't bear it , would do the trick . " No word or sign . Suddenly I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Goddam it , go to work ! Think of something ! Do something ! " Without opening his eyes , he muttered , " And I said it was satisfactory to have you back . "  |p183That  was an afternoon I would n't care to live through again , not even if I knew what the evening was going to bring . To begin with , Wolfe was totally unbearable . After lunch he got behind his desk with a book , and after a dozen assorted attempts to get a conversation started I quit . Then Saul Panzer phoned in , and he growled at me to get off the line . I had already suspected that he had Saul on a trail , since a check of the cash box and book had informed me that he had given Saul three hundred bucks , and that confirmed it . I always resent it when he sees fit to give one of the boys a chore that he thinks I do n't need to know about , and that time it was more offensive than usual , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my tail , yawning . Worse than him , though , was me . He had told me twice to take a nap , so naturally I was n't going to . I wanted to be there if the phone rang . I wanted to be there if Mrs. Adams came to confess to the three murders . But I did not want to make out checks or work on the germination records or go through catalogues . My problem was to stay awake without having anything to keep my eyes open , and it was even tougher after Wolfe went up to the plant rooms at four o'clock . For two solid hours only one notion occurred to me that had any attraction at all , to phone Mrs. Potter in Glendale and tell her I had got home safely , and I ve/toed that because it might prove to be habit-forming . But by gum I stayed awake , if you can call it that . There was another call from Saul just before dinner , and again I was told to get off the line . Wolfe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After dinner he told me to go to bed , and God knows I would have liked to , but I got stubbornand went for a walk instead . I dropped in at a movie , found myself getting fascinated with the idea of resting my head on the soft fat female shoulder next to me , jerked away , and got up and went home . It was a little after ten . Wolfe was at his desk , going through the stack of germinationslips that had accumulated while I was away . I asked him , " Any more movement ? " " No . " I gave up . " I might as well go up and lie down a while . " I went and twirled the knob of the safe . " I put the bolt on in front and I 'll check the back . Good night . " " Good night . " The phone rang . I stepped to my desk and got it . " Nero Wolfe 's residence , Archie Goodwin speaking . " " I want to speak to Wolfe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James A. Corrigan . " I covered the transmitter and told Wolfe , " Corrigan . He sounds hoarse and harassed . Do you care to speak to him ? " Wolfe took his instrument , and I put mine back at my ear . " This is Nero Wolfe . Mr. Corrigan ? " " Yes . I 've mailed you a letter , but you 're responsible for this , so I think you ought to hear it . I hope you 'll hear it in your dreams the rest of your life . This is it . Are you lis-tening ? "  | " Yes , but  --  " " Here it goes . " It busted my eardrum , or felt like it . It was a combinationof a roar and a smack . By reflex my wrist moved the receiver away , then I moved it back . There was a confused clatter and a sort of thump , then nothing . I told the transmitter , " Hello hello ! " Nothing . I cradled it and turned . Wolfe was sitting with the instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well ? " he demanded . " Well yourself . How do I know ? I suppose he shot him-self . " " Where was he ? " I sneered . " Do you think I staged it ? " " There was a radio going . " " I heard it . The Life of Riley : WNBC . " He replaced the phone , slow motion , and regarded me . " This is preposterous . I do n't believe it . Get Mr. Cramer . " I swiveled and dialed and got a voice . I asked for Cramer , and he was n't there . Neither was Stebbins . I got a sergeant named Auerbach , informed Wolfe , and he took it . " Mr. Auerbach ? This is Nero Wolfe . Are you familiar with the Dykes-Wellman-Abrams case ? " " Yes . " " And with the name James A. Corrigan ? " " Yes , I know the name . " " I just had a phone call . The voice said it was James A. Corrigan , but it was husky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said  --  I think you should put this down . Have you pencil and paper ? " " In a second  --  okay , shoot . "  | " He said it was Corrigan , and then , quote , You 're responsiblefor this , so I think you ought to hear it . I hope you 'll hear it in your dreams the rest of your life . This is it . Are you listening ? Here it goes . ' Unquote . There came immediately the sound of an explosion , resembling a gunshot , and other confused noises , followed by silence except for the sound of a radio , which had been audible throughout . That 's all . " " Did he say where he was phoning from ? " ve told you all I know . As I said , that 's all . " " Where are you now ? " " At my home . " " You 'll be there if we want you ? " " Yes . " " Okay . " He hung up . So did Wolfe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I observed . " You forgot that he said he had mailed you a letter . " " I like to see my mail first , without interference . Where does Mr. Corrigan live ? " I got the Manhattan phone book , turned the pages , and found it . Then , to check , I went and unlocked the filing cabinet , got out the Wellman folder , and fingered through the papers . I announced , " Corrigan lives at one-forty-five East Thirty-sixth Street . Phelps lives at three-seventeen Central Park West . Kustin lives at nine-sixty-six Park Avenue . Briggs lives at Larchmont . O'Malley lives at two-ohtwoEast Eighty-eighth . " I put the folder back and locked the cabinet . " Am I going to bed now ? " " No . " " I thought not . What , sit here and wait ? Even if they find a corpse they might not get around to us until morning.  |p187It  would take a taxi five minutes to go crosstown to Thirtysixthand Lexington . The fare would be fifty cents includingtip . If it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . " I went to the hall for my hat and coat , let myself out , and walked a block north . At Tenth Avenue I flagged a passing taxi , got in , and gave the driver the address . A radio car was double-parked in front of 145 East Thirty-sixth , with no one in it . I entered the building . On the list of names on the wall of the vestibule , Corrigan was at the top , fifth . I went on in . It was an old private dwelling done over into apartments , with a self-service elevator . The elevator was there at that floor . From somewherebelow came a faint sound of voices , but there was no one in sight . I opened the elevator door , entered , pushed the 5 button , and was lifted . When it stopped I emerged . There was only one door , at the right of the small hall , and standing at it was a cop . " Who are you ? " he asked , not sociably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What do you want ? " " I want to go to bed . Before I can do so I have to find out if we got imposed on . We reported this . The guy that lives here , so he said , phoned us and told us to listen , and then a gun went off or a good imitation of one . He did n't hang up but he was gone , and we phoned Homicide . We do n't know if the phone call was from here , and I came tosee . " Why Homicide ? " " This might be connected with a case they 're on . We have friends there  --  sometimes friends , sometimes enemies , you know how it is . Is your colleague insider '  | " No . The door 's locked . He went down for the superintendent . What did the guy say on the phone ? " " He just said we ought to hear something and told us to listen , and bang . May I put my ear to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the radio . " " Yeah , I 've heard of you . Full of gags . Should I laugh ? " " No gags tonight , I 'm too sleepy . We heard the radioon the phone , and I thought I 'd check . If you do n't mind ? " " Do n't touch the door or the knob . " " I wo n't . " He stepped aside , and I got my ear close to the angle of the door and the jamb . Ten seconds was enough . As I listened there was another sound in the hall , the elevator starting down . I moved away . " Right . Bill Stern . WNBC . ' " It was Bill Stern on the phone ? " " No , but it was WNBC . The Life of Riley . ' Bill Stern goes on at ten-thirty . " " The Yankees look good , do n't they ? " I 'm a Giant fan , but I wanted to get inside and had to be tactful . So I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He did too , but he was skeptical . He thought these wonder boys seldom live up to their billing . He thought various other things , and was telling about them when the elevator returned and its door opened , and we had company . One was his colleague and the other was a little runt with very few teeth and a limp , wearing an old overcoat for a dressing gown . The cop , surprised at sight of me , asked his brother , " Who 's this , not precinct ? " " No . Nero Wolfe 's Archie Goodwin . "  | " Oh , him . How come ? " " Save it . Hey , get away from that door ! Gim me that key ! " The runt surrendered it and backed off . The cop in commandinserted the key and turned it , used his handkerchief to turn the knob , which made me suppress a snicker , pushed the door , and entered , with his colleague at his heels . I was right behind . We were in a narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle . The one at the right was open , and the cop headed for that and on through . Two steps inside he stopped , so I just made the sill . It was a fairly big living room , furnished comfortably by a man for a man . That was merely the verdict of one sweeping glance , for any real survey of the furniture , if required , would have to wait . On a table at the far side , between two windows , was the phone , with the receiver off , lying on the floor . Also on the floor , six inches from thewas the head of James A. Corrigan , with the rest of him stretched out toward a window . A third item on the floor , a couple of feet from Corrigan 's hip , was a gun  --  from where I stood I would have said a Marley .32 . The lights were on . Also on was a radio at the end of the table , with Bill Stern telling what he thought of the basketball stink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that distance , on Corrigan 's right temple . The cop crossed to him and squatted . In ten seconds , which was n't long enough , he got upright and spoke . " DOA . " There seemed to be a little shake in his voice , and he raised it . " We ca n't use this phone . Go down and call in . Do n't break your neck . " The colleague went . The cop kept his voice up . " Canp190you see him from there , Goodwin ? Come closer , but keep your hands off . " I approached . " That 's him . The guy that phoned . James A. Corrigan . " " Then you heard him shoot himself . " " I guess I did . " I put one hand on my belly and the other on my throat . " I did n't get any sleep last night and I 'm feeling sick . I 'm going to the bathroom . " " Do n't touch anything . " " I wo n't . " I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio had n't been going . It was plenty loud enough to cover my toe steps through the outer door , which was standing open , and in the hall to the door to the stairs . Descending the four flights , I listened a moment behind the door to the groundfloorhall , heard nothing , opened it , and passed through . The runt was standing by the elevator door , looking scared . He said nothing , and neither did I , as I crossed to the entrance . Outside I turned right , walked the half a short block to Lexington Avenue and stopped a taxi , and in seven minutes was climbing out in front of Wolfe 's house . When I entered the office I had to grin . Wolfe 's current book was lying on his desk , and he was fussing with the germination slips . It was comical . He had been reading the book , and , when the sound came of me opening the front door , he had hastily ditched the book and got busy with the germination slips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I had n't made the entries from the slips on the permanent record cards . It was so childish I could n't help grinning . " May I interrupt ? " I asked politely.  |p191He  looked up . " Since you 're back so soon I assume you found nothing of interest . " " Sometimes you assume wrong . I 'm back so soon because a flock of scientists would be coming and I might have been kept all night . I saw Corrigan . Dead . Bullet through his temple . " He let the slips in his hand drop to the desk . " Please report . " I did so , in full , including even the cop 's thoughts about the Yankees . Wolfe was scowling some when I started and a lot more by the time I finished . He asked a few questions , sat a while tapping with a forefinger on the arm of his chair , and suddenly blurted at me , " Was the man a nin-compoop ? " " Who , the cop ? " " No . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In California he was n't exactly brilliant , but I would n't say a nincompoop . Why ? " " It 's absurd . Totally . If you had stayed there you might have got something that would give some light . " " If I had stayed there I would have been corralled in a corner for an hour or so until someone decided to start in on me . " He nodded grudgingly . " I suppose so . " He looked up at the clock and put his thumbs at the edge of his desk to shove his chair back . " Confound it . An exasperating piece of nonsense to go to bed on . " " Yeah . Especially knowing that around midnight or later we 'll get either a ring or a personal appearance . " But we did n't . I slept like a log for nine hours.  |p192Saturday  morning I never did finish the newspaper accountsof the violent death of James A. Corrigan , the prominentattorney . Phone calls interrupted my breakfast four times . One was from Lon Cohen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call he had got from Corrigan , and two were from other journalists , wanting the same . I stalled them . The fourth was from Mrs. Abrams . She had read the morning paper and wanted to know if the Mr. Corrigan who had shot himself was the man who had killed her Rachel , though she did n't put it as direct as that . I stalled her too . My prolonged breakfast was ruining Fritz 's schedule , so when the morning mail came I took my second cup of coffee to the office . I flipped through the envelopes , tossed all but one on my desk , glanced at the clock and saw 8:55 . Wolfe invariably started for the plant rooms at nine sharp . I went and ran up the flight of stairs to his room and knocked , entered without waiting for an invitation , and announced , " Here it is . The firm 's envelope . Postmarked Grand Central Station yesterday , twelve midnight . It 's fat . " " Open it . " He was standing , dressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contents . " Typewritten , singlespaced , dated yesterday , headed at the top To Nero Wolfe . ' Nine pages . Unsigned . " " Read it . "  | " Aloud ? " " No . It 's nine o'clock . You can ring me or come up if necessary . " " Nuts . This is just swagger . " It is not . A schedule broken at will becomes a mere procession of vagaries . " He strode from the room . My eye went to the opening sentence . I have decided to write this but not sign it . I think I want to write it mainly for its cathartic value , but my motives are confused . The events of the past year have made me unsure about everything . It may be that deep in me much is left of the deep regard for truth and justice that I acquired in my youth , through both religious and secular teaching , and that accounts for my feeling that I must write this . Whatever the motiveThe phone rang downstairs . Wolfe 's extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get it . It was Sergeant Purley Stebbins . Purley would always just as soon talk to me as Wolfe , and maybe rather . He 's not dumb by any means , and he has never forgotten the prize boner that Wolfe bluffed him into on the Longren case . He was brusque but not thorny . He said they wanted to know firsthand about two things , Corrigan 's phone call the night before , and my performance in California , especiallymy contacts with Corrigan . When I told him I would be glad to oblige and come down , he said that would n't be necessary because Inspector Cramer wanted to see Wolfe and would drop in at eleven or shortly after . I said that as far as I knew we would let him in , and Purley hung up without saying good-by . I sat at my desk and read :  |p194Whatever  the motive may be , I am going to write it and then decide whether to mail it or destroy it . Even if I mail it I will not sign it because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will of course show it to the police , but without my signature it will certainlynot be released for publication as coming from me . Since the context will clearly identify me by inference , this may seem pointless , but it will serve all desired purposes , whatever my motive may be , withoutmy signature , and those purposes are moral and not legal . I will try not to dwell at length on my motives . To me they are of more concern than the events themselves , but to you and others it is the events that matter . All you will care about is the factual statement that I wrote the anonymous letter to the court giving information about O'Malley 's bribery of a juror , but I want to add that my motive was mixed . I will not deny that moving up to the position of senior partner , with increased power and authority and income , was a factor , but so was my concern for the future of the firm . To have as our senior partner a man who was capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ask why I did n't merely confront O'Malley with it and demand that he get out . On account of the source and nature of my information , which I wo n't go into , I did not have conclusiveproof , and the relations among the members of the firm would have made the outcome doubtful . Anyway , I did write the informing letter to the court . Starting a habit , I said to myself , of not signing things . I resumed . O'Malley was disbarred . That was of course a blow to the firm , but not a fatal one . I became senior part/ner , and Kustin and Briggs were admitted to membership . As the months passed we recovered lost ground . In the late summer and fall of last year our income was higher than it had ever been , partly on account of Kustin 's remarkable performances as a trial lawyer , but I think my leadership was equally responsible . Then , on Monday , December 4 , a date I would never forget if I were going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office in the evening to do some work and had occasion to go to Dykes 's desk to get a document . It was n't where I expected to find it and I went through the drawers . In one of them was a brown fiber portfolio and I looked inside . The documentwas n't there . It contained a stack of neatly assembled sheets of paper . The top sheet , typed like a title page , said " Put Not Your Trust , A Modern Novel of a Lawyer 's Frailty , by Baird Archer . " Through curiosity I looked at the next sheet . It began the text , and the first sentence read " It is not true that all lawyers are cutthroats . " I read on a little and then sat in Dykes 's chair and read more . It is still almost incredible to me that Dykes could have been such a fool . Through his connection with our office he knew something of the libel law , and yet he wrote that and offered it for publication . Of course it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanity is involved , as O'Malley did when he bribed a juror , and Dykes probably thought that the use of an assumed name would somehow protect him . The novel was substantially an account of the activitiesand relationships of our firm . The names were different and most of the scenes and circumstances were invented , but it was unmistakably our firm . Itp196was so badly written that I suppose it would have bored a casual reader , but it did not bore me . It told of O'Malley 's bribery of a juror ( I use our names instead of those Dykes used ) and of my learning of it and sending an anonymous letter to the court , and of O'Malley 's disbarment . He had invented an ending . In the novel O'Malley took to drink and died in the alcoholic ward at Bellevue , and I went to see him on his deathbed , and he pointed at me and screamed , " Put not your trust ! " In one way the novel was ludicrous . Its ending assumed that O'Malley knew I had informed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found out . I took the manuscript home with me . If I had found it by accident and read it , someone else might , and I could n't risk it . After I got home I realized that I would be unable to sleep , and I went out again and took a taxi to Sullivan Street , where Dykes lived . I got him out of bed and told him I had found the manuscriptand read it . In my agitation I did something incredible too . I took it for granted that he knew I had informed on O'Malley and asked how he had found out . I should have assumed that he had invented that . But it did n't matter . He really had found out . I had not written the informing letter to the court on my typewriter here at my apartment , on which I am writingthis . I had taken the precaution of writing it on a machine at the Travelers Club . There was n't more than one chance in a billion of any risk in that , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenseof O'Malley on the bribery charge , we had photostats of all the exhibits , including the anonymous letter to the court . Dykes had made himself a fairly good expert on documents , and as a matter of routinep197he inspected the photostat of the anonymous letter . He noticed that the " t " was out of line , crowding the letter to its right , and slanted a little , and he remembered that he had observed that same defect in some other document . And he found it . He found it in a typed memorandum to him which I had typed two months previously on that same machine at the TravelersClub . I had forgotten about it , and even if I had remembered it I would probably have considered the risk negligible . But with that hint to start him , Dykes had compared the photostat with the memorandum under a glass and established that the two had been typed on the same machine . Of course that was not conclusive proof that I had typed and sent the letter to the court , but it convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and read the manuscript . He swore that he had had no intention or desire to expose me , and when I insisted that he must have told someone , possibly O'Malley himself , he swore that he had n't , and I believed him . He had the carbon of the manuscript there in his room . The originalhad been returned to him by a firm of publishers , Scholl &; Hanna , to whom he had submitted it , and he had put it temporarily in his desk at the office , with the intention of putting it in the hands of a literary agent . The longhand manuscript , written by him in longhand , from which the typist had worked , was also there in his room . He turned both the carbon copy and the longhand script over to me , and I took them home when I went and destroyed them . I also destroyed the original of the typed script two days later , after I had reread it . I felt that I was fairly safe from exposure . I had of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had informed on my partner in an anonymousletter the effect on my career and reputation would have been disastrous . It was not so much anythingO'Malley himself could or might do as the attitudeof others , particularly two of my present partners and certain other associates . Actually I would have been a ruined man . But I felt fairly safe . If Dykes was telling the truth , and I believed he was , all copies of the manuscript had been destroyed . He gave me the most solemn assurances that he would never speak of the matter to anyone , but my chief reliance was in the fact that it was to his own self-interest to keep silent . His own future depended on the future welfare of the firm , and if he spoke the firm would certainly be disrupted . I saw Dykes several times at his room in the evening , and on one of those occasions I did a foolish and thoughtless thing , though at the time it seemed of no consequence . No , that 's wrong this occasion was not at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken from the file the letter of resignation which he had written months previously , and it was on my desk . I asked him , for no special reason that I remember , if the title " Put Not Your Trust " was from Shakespeare , and he said no , that it was in the 3rd verse of the 146th Psalm , and I scribbled it in a corner of his letter of resignation , " Ps 146-3 . " The phone was ringing , but I finished the paragraph before I answered it . It was Louis Kustin . He did n't sound as if his eyes were looking sleepy . He wanted to speak to Wolfe , and I told him he would n't be available until eleven o'clock . " I suppose he 's available to you ? " he asked curtly.  | " Sure , I live here . " " My associates and I are conferring , and I am speakingon their behalf as well as my own . I 'm at my office . Tell Wolfe I want to speak to him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our senior partner is an irreparable blow to us , and if it can be established that Wolfe willfully and maliciously drove him to it he will be held accountable . Tell him that ? " " It 'll ruin the day for him . " " I hope to ruin all his days . " The connection went . I wanted to resume my reading but thought I 'd better pass it on and buzzed the plant rooms on the house phone . Wolfe answered . I reported the conversation . " Pfui , " he said shortly and hung up . I went back to Corrigan . I felt that I was fairly safe , though I was not completelyeasy . Toward the end of December I was shocked into a realization of my true position . Dykes came into my office , during office hours , and asked for a raise in pay of 50 per cent . He said that he had expected to make a considerable sum from the sale of his novel , and now that he had surrendered that source of income he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once what I should have seen clearly before , that I would be at his mercy for years if not for life , and that his demands would be limited only by his desires . I was literally in a panic but concealed it successfully . I told him that I had to consider the problem of justifying so large a raise to my associates , and asked him to come to my apartment the following evening , Saturday , December 30 , to discuss the matter . By the time he arrived for the appointment I hadp200decided that I would have to kill him . It proved to be an absurdly easy thing to do , as he did not suspect my intention and was not on guard . As he sat I went to his rear on some trivial excuse , picked up a heavy paperweight , and hit him on the head . He crumpled without a sound , and I hit him again . During the four hours that I waited for the deserted streets of late night , or early morning , I had to hit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my car and parked it directly in front . When the time came I got him downstairs and into the car without being observed . I drove uptown to an unused East River pier in the Nineties and rolled the body into the water . I must have been less calm and cool than I thought I was , for I thought he was dead . Two days later , in the newspaper account of the recovery of the body , I learned that he had died of drowning , so when I rolled him in he was only stunned . It was then two in the morning , and I was not through . I drove downtown to Sullivan Street and let myself into Dykes 's apartment with the key I had taken from his pocket . With my bare hands an hour there would have been enough , but with gloves on it took three hours to make a thorough search . I found only three items , but they were well worth it . Two of them were receipts signed by Rachel Abrams for paymentsfor typing made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed to Baird Archer at General Delivery , Clinton Station , on the letterhead of Scholl &; Hanna , signed by Joan Wellman . I said I made a thoroughsearch , but there were many books on the shelves , and there was n't time to turn through every page of them even if I had thought it necessary . If I had done so I would have found the sheet of paperp201on which Dykes made that list of names with Baird Archer among them , and you would never have seen it , and I would n't be writing you this now . For a while , a week or so , I had no intention of doinganything about Joan Wellman or Rachel Abrams , but then I began to worry . One of them had typed the script and the other had read it . The trial of O'Malley and the juror and the disbarment proceedings had of course been fully reported in the papers , only a year ago . What if one of those women or both of them had noticed the similarity , or rather the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What if they had mentioned it or an occasion arose for them to mention it in the future ? They were less dangerous than Dykes , but they were dangerous , or might be . That was more and more on my mind , and finally I did something about it . The last day of January , a Wednesday , I phoned Joan Wellman at her office . I told her I was Baird Archer , and offered to pay her for advice about my novel , and made an appointment with her for the next day but one , Friday , at fivethirty . We met in the Ruby Room at the Churchill and had drinks and talked . She was attractive and intelligent , and I was thinking that it would be impossible to do her any serious harm , when she asked me point blank about the remarkable resemblance between the plot of my novel and an occurrence in real life here in New York a year ago . She said she was n't sure she remembered the name of the disbarred lawyer , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said I did n't . I said I had n't consciously used any happening in real life when I was plotting the novel , but of course it might have been in my subconscious . She said that as far as she remembered it had n't comep202out that O'Mara had been betrayed by one of his partners , and it would be interesting to look into it and see if my subconscious had not only copied what had been published but had also , by insight or intuition , divined what had not been published . That was enough for me , more than enough . I guided the talk , while we were having dinner , to a point where it was appropriate for me to suggest that we drive to my apartment in the Bronx so I could get the manuscript . She gave me a bad moment when she asked , if I lived in the Bronx , why had I given my address as General Delivery , Clinton Station , but I gave her an answer that satisfied her . She said she would go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would n't go up to my apartment . I was sorry I had met her in so public a place as the Ruby Room , but neither of us had seen anyone we knew and I resolved to go ahead . I went alone to get my car and picked her up in front of the Churchill and drove to Washington Heights . There , in a side street , it was as simple as it had been with Dykes . I remarked that the windshield was misted on the inside and reached behind me as if for my handkerchief , got a heavy wrench I had placed there when I went for my car , and hit her with it . She did n't even groan . I tried to prop her up but could n't , and lifted her over into the back onto the floor . On the way to Van Cortlandt Park I stopped several times to take a look at her . Once she seemed to be stirring , and I had to hit her again . I drove to a secluded road in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was only ten o'clock and there was a chance that a car might come along at the worst moment , even in February , so I left the park , drovep203around for two hours , and then returned to the park and the secluded road . The risk was then at a minimum , and anyhow I had to take it . I took her out of the car , put her on the road near the edge , and ran the car over her . Then I drove away fast . When I was miles away I stopped under a light and inspected the car for signs of blood or other evidence , but I had been careful to go slowly when passing over her and I could find nothing . I put the thing down on my desk , looked at my watch , and saw 9:35 . In Peoria , Illinois , it was 8:35 , and John R. Wellman , according to the schedule he had given me , would be at his place of business . I reached for the phone and put in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archie Goodwin . I promised to let you know immediately if anything broke . Corrigan , senior partner in that law firm , was found dead on the floor of his apartment last night with a hole in his head and a gun lying nearby . I would  --  " " Did he shoot himself ? " " I do n't know . As a purely personal opinion , it looks like it . I would call that a break , but whether good or bad is for Mr. Wolfe to decide , not me . I 'm just keeping my promiseand telling you . As it stands this minute , that 's all I can say . Mr. Wolfe is busy upstairs . " " Thank you , Mr. Goodwin . Thank you very much . I 'll go to Chicago and take a plane . I 'll call you when I reach New York . " I told him that would be fine , hung up , and returned to my reading . There was only one other living person who knew the contents of that manuscript , Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical and sensible thing to do . Until three months ago I had never been conscious of anything in my mind or heart to justify any conceptof myself as a potential murderer . I believed that I understood myself at least as well as most people . I was aware that there was an element of casuistry in my self-justification for what I had done to O'Malley , but without that intellectual resource no man could preserve his self-esteem . At any rate , I was an altogetherdifferent being from the moment I rolled Dykes 's body from the pier into the water . I did n't know it at the time , but I do now . The change was not so much in my conscious mind as in the depths . If the processes of the subconscious can be put into rational terms at all , I think mine were something like this : ( a ) I have murdered a man in cold blood ; ( b ) I am a decent and humane person , as men go , certainly not vicious or depraved ; therefore ( c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and immoral . My inner being could not permit me to feel any moral repulsion at the thought of killing Joan Wellman , certainly not enough to restrain me , for if killing her was morally unacceptable how could I justify the killing of Dykes ? By killing Joan Wellman the process was completed . After that , given adequate motive , I could have killed any number of people without any sign of compunction . So in contemplating the murder of Rachel Abrams my only concerns were whether it was necessary and whether it could be performed without undue risk . I decided it was necessary . As for the risk , I left that to circumstances . With her I could not use the same kindp205of subterfuge I had used with Joan Wellman , since she had known Dykes as Baird Archer . My plan was so simple that it was really no plan at all . I merely went to her office one rainy afternoon , unannounced . If she had had an associate there with her , or if any one of a dozen other possible obstacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a procedure . But she had only one room and was there alone . I told her I wanted a typing job done , approached her to show her what it was , grasped her throat , had her unconsciousin half a minute , opened the window , and lifted her and pushed her out . Unfortunately I had no time to search for records ; of course I had no time at all . I left , ran down the stairs to the next floor , and took the elevator there , having got off there on my way up . When I left the building her body was on the sidewalkand a crowd was already collecting . Three days later , when my associates and I came to see you , I learned that I had been ahead of your man Goodwin by not more than two minutes . I took that as conclusiveevidence that luck was on my side , even though he found entries in her records that connected her with Baird Archer . If he had got to her alive he would have learned the contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we called on you , nine days ago , I knew I was in danger but was confident that I could ward it off . You knew of Baird Archer and the manuscript and had connected them with Dykes and therefore with our office , but that was all . Your noticingthat scribbled " Ps 146-3 " on Dykes 's letter of resignationin my handwriting , and correctly interpreting it , increased the danger only slightly if at all , since my plain square hand can be easily imitated by almostanyone and my associates unanimously sup/ported me in convincing the police that you must have made the notation yourself in an effort to trick us . Wednesday , when the letter from Mrs. Potter arrived , I did not suspect that you had anything to do with it . I thought it was a deadly blow that fate had dealt me at the worst possible moment . It was brought to me , but since it had been addressed not to an individualbut to the firm our mail clerk had read it , and therefore I had to show it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was essentialfor us to learn what was in the manuscript , and that one of us must go immediately to California . There was a division of opinion as to who should go , and of course I had to insist that it must be me . Since I was the senior partner my view prevailed and I left by the first available plane . You know what happened in California . I was in great peril , but I was not desperate until I went to Finch 's room in his absence and found Goodwin there . From that moment my position was manifestly hopeless , but I refused to give up . Since , through Goodwin , you had certainly learned the content of the manuscript , my betrayal of O'Malley was sure to be disclosed , but it might yet he possible to avoid a charge of murder . All night , on the plane , with Goodwin seated there only a few feet from me , I considered possible courses and plans . I had phoned one of my partners from Los Angeles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , going directly from the airport . Their unanimousopinion was that we should call on you and demandto be told the substance of the manuscript . I argued strongly for an alternative course but could not sway them . When we went to your office I wasp207prepared to face the disclosure of my betrayal of O'Malley , supposing that you would tell us about the manuscript , but instead of that you dealt me another blow . You told us nothing , saying that you were not quite ready to act and that you still needed a fact or two . For me that could have only one meaning . You did not intend to expose my betrayal of O'Malley until you were fully prepared to use it as evidence on a charge of murder , and you would not have said that to us unless you expected soon to be prepared . I did n't know which fact or two you still needed , but it did n't matter . Obviously you had me or you would soon get me . My associates wanted a luncheon conference , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came here to my apartment . Again my subconscious had taken command , for it came to me in a rush of sudden surprise that I had irrevocably determined to kill myself . I did not dispute the decision . I calmly accepted it . The further decision , whether to leave behind me an account of my disaster and what led to it , has not yet been made . I have spent hours writing this . I shall now read it over and decide . If I send it at all it will go to you , since it is you who have destroyed me . Again here at the end , as at the beginning , what interests me most is my motive . What is it in me that wants to send this to you , or to anyone ? But if I start on that I will never end . If I do send it I will not attempt to tell you what to do with it , since in any case you will do as you see fit . That is what I am doing ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . I jiggled the sheets together , refolded them , slipped them into the envelope , and went and mounted208 MURDER BY THE BOOKthe three flights to the plant rooms . Wolfe , wearing one of his new yellow smocks , was in the potting room inspectingthe roots of some Dendrobiums he had knocked out of the pots . I handed him the envelope and told him , " You 'll have to read this . " " When I come down . " " Cramer is coming at eleven . If you read it with him sitting there he 'll get impatient . If you talk with him withoutreading it I would prefer not to be present . " " What does it say ? " " A full confession . Betrayal of his partner O'Malley , three murders  --  the works . " " Very well . I 'll wash my hands . ' He went to the sink and turned the faucet on.  | " This , " Wolfe told Inspector Cramer , " is correct not only in substance but also in text . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cramer , of what Corrigan had said to us on the phone just before the bang , as reported by Wolfe to Sergeant Auerbach . Cramer looked at me . " You were on the line too , Goodwin ? You heard it ? " I nodded , arose , got the paper from Wolfe , read it , and handed it back . " Right . That 's what he said . " " I want a statement to that effect signed by both of you . " " Certainly , " Wolfe acceded . Cramer was in the red leather chair , leaning back comfortably , like a man intending to stay a while . " Also , " he said , not belligerently , " I want a statement from Goodwin giving all details of his trip to California . But first I would like to hear him tell it . " " No , " Wolfe said firmly . " Why not ? " " On principle . Through habit you put it as a demand , and it 's a bad habit . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to a violent death in my jurisdiction . " " " Establish that . " " Nuts , " Cramer growled . " I ask it as a favor . Not to me , to the People of the State of New York . " " Very well . Having had an authentic discovery of mine ,  |p210the  notation in Corrigan 's handwriting on Dykes 's letter , denounced by them and you as a trick , I thought it only fair to even up by contriving a trick . I needed  --  " " So you still claim that notation was made by Corrigan ? " " No . I never made that claim . I only denied that it was made by Mr. Goodwin or me . I needed to demonstrate that someone in that office was involved in Baird Archer 's manuscript and therefore in the murders , and I proceeded to do so . Tell him about it , Archie . " " Yes , sir . Leaving out what ? " " Nothing . " If I had been alone with Cramer and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fun , but under the circumstances I refrained . I gave it to him straight , accurate and complete , from my checking in at the Riviera to my last view of Corrigan 's rear at La Guardia Airport as he trotted out to a taxi . When I finished he had a few questions , and I answered them straight too . He was chewing an unlit cigar . He took it from his mouth and turned to Wolfe . " What it amounts to , you tricked  --  " " If you please , " Wolfe interposed . " Since you have part you should have all . Yesterday morning , less than three hours after Corrigan 's return , they came here  --  all five of them . They demanded that I tell them what was in the manuscript , and I refused . I would have had to refuse in any case , since I did n't know , but I told them that I was n't quite ready to act , that I needed one or two more facts . I permitted them to assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . " You tricked him into killing himself . " " Did I ? Did he kill himself ? " " Goddam it , did n't he ? "  | " I do n't know . You have investigated , I have n't . What have you concluded ? " Cramer scratched his ear . " There 's nothing against suicide . It was his gun , fired at contact . Smudges on it , no clear prints . His prints on the phone . He had been dead less than an hour when the examiner arrived . No evidence so far of anyone else being there . He had been struck a hard blow on the side of the head but could have got it from the corner of the table when he fell , and probably did . There was  --  " Wolfe waved it away . " From you , nothing against suicide ' is enough . On that sort of thing you are not to be impugned . But it is still open ? " " It 's not closed . That 's why I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , and you may or may not hear more about that , but right now I want a lot more than you 've given me . If it was suicide , why ? Because he thought you knew what was in that damn manuscript ? Because he thought you had him ? For what ? Murder ? I want a lot more , a hell of a lot , and I 'm here to get it . " Wolfe pursed his lips . " Well . " He opened a desk drawer . " This came in my morning mail . " He took a fat envelope from the drawer . " See if that answers your questions . " He held it out . Cramer got up to take the envelope and sat down again . He inspected the outside of the envelope before he removed the contents . He unfolded the sheets , read a little , looked at Wolfe , made a growling noise , and read some more . As he finished the first page and transferred it to the back , he inquired , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . '  |p212He  had no more to say or to ask until he got to the end . Wolfe leaned back , shut his eyes , and relaxed . I kept my eyes open . I kept them on Cramer 's face , but all I saw was a man so intent and absorbed that he had no expression at all . When he finished he went back to a place on the third or fourth page and read it over . Then he looked at Wolfe , with his lips tightened to a thin line . " You got this three hours ago , " he muttered . Wolfe opened his eyes . " I beg your pardon ? " " You got this three hours ago . You know how to phone my office . Sergeant Stebbins talked to Goodwin at nine o'clock . Goodwin did n't mention it . " " I had n't read it yet , " I stated . " It had just come . " " You know my number . " " Bosh , " Wolfe said testily . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , you have n't . " Cramer wiggled the sheets . " What evidence is there that Corrigan wrote this ? " " None . " " What evidence is there that you did n't dictate it to Goodwin and he wrote it ? " " None . " Wolfe straightened up . " Mr. Cramer . You might as well leave . If you are in a frame of mind to think me capable of so extravagant an imbecility , all communication is blocked . " He wiggled a finger . " You have that thing . Take it and go . " Cramer ignored it . " You maintain that Corrigan wrote this . " " I do not . I maintain only that I received it in today 's mail , and that I have no knowledge of who wrote it beyond the thing itself . I suppose other evidence is procurable . If there is a typewriter in Corrigan 's apartment , and if in/vestigation shows it was written on that machine , that would be pertinent . " " You have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I have not . " " Do you know of any evidence other than this that Corrigancommitted the murders ? " " No . " Or that he betrayed his partner O'Malley ? " " No . " " Do you believe this to be an authentic confession by Corrigan ? " " I 'm not prepared to say . I 've read it only once , rather hurriedly . I was going to ask you to let Mr. Goodwin make a copy for me , but I 'll get along without it . " " You wo n't have to . I 'll see that you get a copy , with the understanding that there is to be no publication of it withoutmy consent . " Cramer folded the sheets and put them in the envelope . " It 's covered with your and Goodwin 's prints now , and mine . But we 'll try it . " " If it 's a fake , " Wolfe said dryly , " I should think that a man capable of contriving it would know about finger-prints . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cramer rubbed his kneecaps with his palms , regarding Wolfe with his head cocked . The chewed cigar , which had previously taken no part in the conversation , slipped from his fingers and fell to the floor , but he made no move to retrieve it . He spoke . " I admit this is damn neat . It will stand a lot of checking , but I admit it 's neat . What are you going to do now , send your client a bill ? "  | " No . " " Why not ? " " My client , Mr. Wellman , has his share of gumption . Before I bill him both he and I must be satisfied that I have earned my fee . " Wolfe 's eyes moved . " Archie . Trained as you are , can I rely on you for an accurate copy of that communicationfrom  --  ostensibly  --  Mr. Corrigan ? " " It 's pretty long , " I objected , " and I read it once . " " I said I 'll send you a copy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would like to have it as soon as possible . It would be gratifying to have it validated , both by your investigation and my scrutiny , since that would mean that I have exposed a murderer and forced him to a reckoningwithout a scrap of evidence against him . We still have none , not a tittle , except that unsigned communica-tion . " " I know we have n't . " " Then by all means check it , every detail , every word . Do you want a comment ? " " Yes . " " A focus of interest is the anonymous letter informingon O'Malley . Suppose it was sent not by Corrigan , but by one of the others . In that case that confession may be factually correct in every important detail but one , the identity of the culprit ; and the real culprit , finding me too close for comfort , may have decided to shift the burden onto Corrigan , not concerned that the shift required one more murder . So of first importance is the question , was it Corrigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informing letter to the court or a photostat of it , and something authentically typed on the machine at thep215Travelers Club . You will need to know whether any of the others frequented that club or otherwise had access to that machine . With your authority , that kind of inquiry is vastly easier for you than for me . " Cramer nodded . " What else ? " " At present , nothing . " " What are you going to do ? " " Sit here . " " Some day you 'll get chair sores . " Cramer got up . He saw the cigar on the floor , stooped to pick it up , crossed to my wastebasket , and dropped it in . His manners were improving . He started for the door , halted , and turned . " Do n't forget those statements , what Corrigan said  --  by the way , what about that ? Was it him on the phone or was n't it ? " " I do n't know . As I said , the voice was husky and agitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great talent for mimicry would have been needed . " " That 's a help . Do n't forget the statements , what Corriganor somebody said on the phone , what Goodwin did in California , and now getting this thing in the mail . To-day . " Wolfe told him certainly , and he turned and went . I looked at my watch . I addressed my employer . " Kustin phoned nearly three hours ago , as I reported . He wanted you to phone him quick so he can warn you that they 're going to hold you accountable . Shall I get him ? " " No . " Shall I call Sue or Eleanor or Blanche and make a date for tonight ? " " No "  | " Shall I think of things to suggest ? " " No . " Then it 's all over ? Then Corrigan wrote that thing and shot himself ? " " No . Confound it . He did n't . Take your notebook . We might as well get those statements done . "  |p217Forty-eight  hours later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At our end much had been accomplished . I had got a haircut and a shampoo . I had spent some pleasant hours with Lily Rowan . I had spent half an hour with Wellman , our client , who had called at the office after taking a plane from Chicago and was staying over to await developments . I had had two good nights ' sleep and had taken a walk to the Battery and back , with a stopover at Homicide on Twentieth Street to deliver the statements Cramer had requested . I had made five copies of Corrigan 's confession , from the copy Cramer had sent us as agreed . I had answeredthree phone calls from Saul Panzer , switched him to Wolfe , and got off the line by command . I had answered thirty or forty other phone calls , none of which would interest you . I had done some office chores , and had eaten six meals . Wolfe had by no means been idle . He had eaten six meals too . One thing neither of us had done , we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been any , though of course the death of a prominentattorney by a gunshot had been adequately covered , including pointed reference to previous regrettable occurrencesconnected with his firm . Evidently Cramer wasp218saving the confession for his scrapbook , though it was n't autographed . Monday morning he sat in the red leather chair and announced , " The DA 's office is ready to call it suicide . " Wolfe , at his desk , was pouring beer . He put the bottle down , waited for the foam to subside to the right level so that the tilt would get him beer and would also moisten his lips with foam , lifted the glass , and drank . He liked to let the foam dry on his lips , but not when there was company , so he used his handkerchief before he spoke . " And you ? " " I do n't see why not . " Cramer , having accepted the invitation to help with the beer , which he rarely did , had his glass in his hand . " I could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's like this . The confession was typed on the machine in his apartment . He 's had it there for years . He has always done quite a little typing kept a supply of the firm 's paper and envelopes there . His secretary , Mrs. Adams , admits that there is nothing about the typing or the text to cause a reasonable doubt that he typed it . " " Admits ? " " Yes . She defends him . She wo n't believe he betrayed O'Malley or committed murder . " Cramer emptied his glass and put it down . " I can give you more on the confession , plenty more , but the DA is n't prepared to impeach it , and neither am I. We ca n't challenge any of its facts . As for the dates of the murders , December thirtieth , Februarysecond , and February twenty-sixth , of course Corriganhad already been checked on that along with all the others . The file had him alibied for the twenty-sixth , the afternoon Rachel Abrams was killed , but digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to dig more on it if he was alive to take to a jury and we had to face a defense , but he 's dead and there 'll be no jury . We ca n't get a check on December fourth , the day he says he was at his office in the evening and found Dykes 's manuscript and read it . There are no other dates to check . " Wolfe grunted . " How are the others on the dates ? Did you go over that ? " " Some . They 're all about the same as Corrigan ; there 's nothing too tight to rip open . As I think I told you once , none of them is completely eliminated by an alibi  --  except O'Malley the day Rachel Abrams was killed . He was in Atlanta , but now that we know what was in the manuscripthe 's out anyway . All it spilled about him was that he had been disbarred for bribing a juror , and God knows that was no secret . Unless you think the confession lies about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I credit it unreservedly . " " Then it does n't matter where O'Malley was . " Cramer reached to empty his bottle into his glass and settled back . " Now about the typewriter at the Travelers Club . It 's still there , in an alcove off of the writing room , but it was overhauledabout two months ago . That does n't stop us , because in the firm 's files we found two items Corrigan had typed on it , memoranda to Mrs. Adams . We got the original of the anonymous letter to the court informing on O'Malley and it was typed on that machine , absolutely no question about it . Corrigan used it occasionally . He ate dinner there two or three times a week and played bridge there Thursdayevenings . None of the others is a member . Two of them , Kustin and Briggs , have been brought there once or twice by Corrigan for dinner , but that 's all . So it looks  --  "  | " This , " Wolfe cut in , " is important . Extremely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceivably have used a typewriter , especially if he needed one that could n't be traced to him . " " Yeah , I know . Saturday you called it a focus of interest . I had Stebbins handle it himself , with instructions to make it good , and he did . Besides , look at it . Say you 're Kustin or Briggs , going there as a guest to eat with Corrigan . Say you use that typewriter for that particular purpose . You ca n't do it , you ca n't even get in that room , without either Corrigan or an attendant knowing about it , probably both of them , and that would be pretty damn dumb . Would n't it ? " " Yes . " " So it looks as if Corrigan did inform on his partner . That alone makes the confession a lot easier to buy , signed or unsigned , and the DA 's office feels the same way about it . Is n't that practically what you said Saturday ? Is there anything wrong with that argument ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a chuckle . " I will accept an apology . " " The hell you will . For what ? " " You accused me , or Mr. Goodwin , of making that crypticnotation on Dykes 's letter of resignation . Well ? " Cramer picked up his glass and drank , in no hurry . He set the glass down . " Uh-huh , " he conceded . " I still say it looked like a typical Wolfe stunt , and I 'm not apologizing . That 's the one detail in that confession that it 's hard to dope . The confession says he made the notation in December , so of course it was n't there when they all saw the letter last summer , that 's all right , but it must have been therep221a week ago Saturday when the letter was sent to you . Yet three of them say it was n't . Phelps asked his secretary , a girl named Dondero , to see if it was in the files , and she dug it out and took it to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conference at Corrigan 's request , and was with Phelps in his room when the girl brought the letter in , and they both looked at it . They wo n't swear the notation was n't on it , but they both think they would have noticed it if it had been , and they did n't notice it . Not only that , the girl says she would testify under oath that there was no such notation on the letter . She says she would positivelyhave noticed it if it had been . Phelps dictated his letter to you , and she typed it , and Phelps signed it , and she put it and Dykes 's letter of resignation , and the other material written by Dykes , into an envelope addressed to you , and sent for a messenger and took the envelope to the anteroom and left it with the switchboard girl to be given to the messenger when he came . So how do I dopeit ? " Wolfe upturned a palm . " Phelps and O'Malley leave it open . The girl is lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force of habit . The etiquette of the sex . " " Nuts . We could n't brush it off with a gag if we had to take it to a jury . As it is , I suppose we can let it slide . We have to if we 're going to buy the confession . " Wolfe turned his head . " Archie . We gave Mr. Cramer the letter from Dykes bearing the notation ? " " Yes , sir . " " The envelope too ? The envelope it came to us in ? " " No , sir . "  | " We have the envelope ? " " Yes , sir . As you know , we keep everything until a case is closed  --  except what we hand to the cops . " Wolfe nodded . " It may possibly be needed to save us from a charge as accessories . " He returned to Cramer . " What about the District Attorney 's office ? Are they willing to let it slide ? " " They think it 's minor . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Has the confession been shown to Corrigan 's asso-ciates ? " " Certainly . " " Do they credit it ? " " Yes and no . It 's hard to tell because they 're half batty . A year ago their senior partner disbarred , and now their new senior partner confessing to three murders and killinghimself  --  they 're in a hell of a fix . Briggs thinks they ought to denounce the confession as a fake and hold you liable , but he 's just babbling . He does n't say you or Goodwinshot Corrigan , but he might as well . Phelps and Kustin say that even if the confession is true it 's invalid because it is n't signed , and any publication of it would be libelous . They think we ought to bury it . But they also think we should accept it as true . Why not ? Corrigan 's dead , and that would make the three murders finished business and they could start gathering up the pieces . Their feeling about you is approximately the same as Briggs ' , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look O'Malley in the eye , though he gives them plenty of chances to . He sticks it in them and twists it . He sent some flowers to the wife of the juror he bribed , with a letter of apology for thinking she informed on him , and before he sent the letterp223he read it aloud to them with Lieutenant Rowcliff present and asked their opinion of it . " There was only an inch of beer left in Cramer 's glass . He got it and drained it and then settled back , not through yet . He rubbed the side of his nose with a fingertip . " I guess that covers it . It looks like a wrap-up . The DA will be ready to give the press a statement as soon as they decide whether to release the confession . Thank God they decide that and not me . But on the main question , do we cross off the murders or do n't we , I 'll have to go along and maybe I 'm ready to , only there 's you to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or twice I have kicked a hat that you had hid a brick in , and I do n't want a sore toe . You connected Joan Wellman with Dykes by spotting that name , Baird Archer . You tied in Rachel Abrams by having Goodwin there two minutes late . You pulled the stunt that got Corrigan a bullet in his head . So I repeat a question I asked you day before yesterday : are you ready to send your client a bill ? " " No , " Wolfe said flatly . " I thought not , " Cramer growled . " What are you waiting for ? " " I 'm through waiting . " Wolfe struck the arm of his chair with his palm , a gesture so violent that with him it was the next thing to hysterics . " I have to be . This ca n't go on forever . I 'll have to do it with what I 've got or not at all . " " What have you got ? " " Nothing that you have n't . Absolutely nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no chance of getting more . If I  --  " The phone rang , and I swiveled and got it . It was Saul Panzer . He wanted Wolfe . Wolfe took it and gave me thep224sign to get off , and I did so . The part of the conversation that Cramer and I listened to was not exciting . Mostly it was grunts , at intervals . Apparently Saul had plenty to say . At the end Wolfe told him , " Satisfactory . Report here at six o'clock , " and hung up . He turned to Cramer . " I 'll have to amend that statement . I now have something that you do not have , but it was easily available to you if you had gone after it . I 'm better off than I was , but not much . I never will be , and I 'm going to act . You 're welcome to participate if you care to " " In what ? " " A risky but resolute effort to expose a murderer . That 's the best I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What did you just get , and who is it ? " Wolfe shook his head . " You would insist on further inquiryand let the moment slip , and further inquiry would be fruitless . He has been too smart for you and almost too smart for me . I 'm going to close with him and I may get him . You may participate or not , as you please . " " Participate how ? " " By getting them here , all of them . This evening at nine o'clock . Including the ten women that Mr. Goodwin entertained at dinner two weeks ago . I need them all , or I may . And of course come yourself . " " If I get them here I take a hand . " Wolfe sighed . " Mr. Cramer . Three weeks ago we agreed to cooperate . I have done so faithfully . I have given you everything I got , without reciprocation . Where do we stand ? You , utterly routed , are ready to join with the DistrictAttorney in unconditional surrender . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his motive , and his strategy . I intend to rush him . You say you should take a hand ? " Cramer was not overwhelmed . " I say if I get them here I am officially responsible and I 'm in charge . " " Very well , then you decline . Mr. Goodwin will get them here . If you come you will not get in . I hope to be ready to communicate with you before midnight . " Cramer sat and scowled . His lips tightened . He opened his mouth , said nothing , and pressed his lips tight again . I was pretty well acquainted with him , and I knew by his eyes that he was going to take it . But he could n't just knuckle under , he had to keep his independence and show his spirit and prove that he was by no means cowed . So he said , " I 'll bring Sergeant Stebbins along . "  |p226We  needed seventeen chairs if they all came , and a phone call from Stebbins around four o'clock informed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , one from the hall , two from my room , and two from Fritz 's room , Fritz and I got them collected and arranged in the office . We had an argument . Fritz insisted there should be a table of liquid refreshments , that Wolfe regarded that as a minimum of hospitality for invited guests , and I fought it . Not so much on account of the basic situation , since more than one murderer had been served a highball or other mixture in that room . The trouble was the females , particularly Helen Troy and Blanche Duke . I did not want the former , at some ticklish spot where everything might hang on a word and a tone , to jump up and call out , " Oyez , oyeth ! " And if the latter , whose inhibitions were totally unreliable , got a shaker full of her formula mixed and worked on it , she might do or say anything . So I was firm . Fritz could n't appeal to Wolfe because he was n't accessible . He was there at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Cramer left he had leaned back , closed his eyes , and started pushing his lips in and out , which meant he was working , and hard . He kept at it until lunch , took only half of his customary hour for the meal , returned to the office , and started in again . He left for the plant rooms at four o'clock as usual , but when I went up there on an errand he was standing in a corner of the in/termediate room frowning at a Cochlioda hybrid that had nothing whatever wrong with it , and he was n't even aware that I was passing through . A little later he phoned down to tell me to send Saul up to him when he came . So I was n't present at their conference . Nor did I get any kind of an instruction for the evening . If he was planning a charade , apparently it was going to be a solo . Wolfe did speak to me once , shortly after lunch ; he asked me to bring him the letter from Phelps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come in . I did so , and , after he had inspected them with a magnifyingglass , he kept them . And I took one step on my own . Wellman was still in town , and I phoned and invited him to attend because I thought he had certainly paid for a ticket . I did n't phone Mrs. Abrams because I knew she would n't care for it no matter what happened . At dinnertime I took another step . As Wolfe sat behind his desk staring at nothing , pulling at his lip with a thumb and forefinger , I saw that he was in no shape to entertain a guest and went and told Fritz that Saul and I would eat in the kitchen with him . Then I returned to the office and announced it to Wolfe . He put his eyes on me without seeing me , let out a low growl , and muttered  --  " All right , but it wo n't help any . " " Can I do anything ? " I asked . " Yes . Shut up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him since Cramer had left , seven hours ago . At ten after nine they had all arrived , but Wolfe was still in the dining room , with the door closed . Leaving the front door and the hall to Saul , I had stayed in the office to supervise the seating . I kept the red leather chair forp228Cramer and put the lawyers in the front row , including O'Malley . Wellman was off in the corner near the globe . Sergeant Purley Stebbins was against the wall , back of Cramer . For Saul Panzer I had put a chair at the end of my desk . My intention had been to group the ten females at the rear of their employers , and I had so placed the chairs , but they had ideas of their own , at least some of them . For about half a minute I stood talking to Cramer with my back to them , and , when I turned , four of them had moved to the couch . From my chair at my desk I could n't take in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I decided to skip it . If Wolfe wanted his audience more compact he could say so . At twelve after nine I sent Saul to tell Wolfe they were all present , and a moment later Wolfe entered . He went straight to his desk , with no halt for a greeting , not even for Cramer , and sat . The murmurs and mutterings stopped . Wolfe got himself settled , taking his time , moved his head slowly over the arc from left to right , and back again . Then his eyes darted left , and he spoke . " Do you want to say anything , Mr. Cramer ? " Cramer cleared his throat . " No . They understand that there 's nothing official about this and I 'm here as an observer . " You told us to come , " Louis Dustin said aggressively . " I invited you . You all know the way out . " " May I make a statement ? " O'Malley asked . " What about ? " " I want to congratulate Mr. Wolfe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question I 've been trying to find for a year and could n't . We 're all in his debt and we ought to say so . "  | " We are not ! " It was Briggs , blinking furiously . " I would like to make a statement ! In my opinion , what Wolfe has done is actionable . I say this after full consideration . I came here because I am convinced  --  " " Shut up ! " Wolfe roared . They gazed at him , astonished . He gazed back , moving his head to include the lot . " I do not intend , " he said coldly , " to let you degrade this to gibberish . We are concerned with death and a dealer of death . I do this work to earn a living , but I am conscious of its dignities and obligations . I hope and believe that in the next two or three hours , here together , we are going to learn the truth about the deaths of four people , and , in doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of you . That 's what we 're here for . I ca n't do it alone , but I 'll have to guide it . " He closed his eyes , tight , and opened them again . " All of you knew Mr. Corrigan , who died Friday evening . You know of a document , ostensibly written by him , in which he confessed that he had betrayed his former partner and had murdered three people . " He opened a drawer and , took out papers . " This is a copy of that confession . It was shrewdly conceived and brilliantly executed , but it was n't good enough for me . It has one fatal defect . The writer could n't possibly avoid including it , because in that detailthe facts were known to others , and the incident was an essential part of the story . When Corrigan  --  " " Are you impeaching it ? " Kustin demanded . " Are you saying that Corrigan ignored them , waited , and continued " When Corrigan was in California his every move was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that record . But that is the fatal defect . According to this confession , Corrigan knew what was in the manuscript writtenby Leonard Dykes  --  he had read it through twice . But in Los Angeles all his efforts were focused on one objective : to get a look at the manuscript . That is emphasizedby the fact that he left Mrs. Potter 's house , with Finch there , to hurry to Finch 's hotel room to search for the manuscript . If he already knew what was in it that was senseless . What good would it do him to find it ? If you say that he wanted to destroy it , that too would have been senseless , since Finch had read it . According to this confession , he had already killed two women for the sole reason that they had read the manuscript . If he found and destroyed Finch 's copy , Finch would be on guard and after him . " Wolfe shook his head . " No . Corrigan 's objective , plainly and unmistakably , was to see the manuscript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodwin was there and saw him and heard him . Do you agree , Archie ? " I nodded . " I do . " " Then he had never seen the manuscript , certainly he had n't read it , and this confession is spurious . There is a corroborative point . " Wolfe tapped the paper . " It says here that Dykes told him that all copies of the manuscript had been destroyed , there were no others , and that he believed it . Indeed he must have believed it fully , for otherwise he would hardly have undertaken the murders of the two women ; but certainly , when the letter came from Mrs. Potter , saying that a literary agent had a copyp231of the manuscript , he would have suspected a snare and would have proceeded quite differently . " Wolfe turned a palm up . " Well ? " " I would have understood this this morning , " Cramer rasped . " Are you challenging the whole confession ? " Phelps inquired . " Are you saying , " O'Malley demanded , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To both of you . But a purported confession shown to be clearly false in so important a detail loses all claim to validity , both as to content and as to authorship . It can be credited only in those parts that are corroborated . For instance , Mr. Cramer has verified it that the anonymous letter to the court was typed on a machine at the TravelersClub , that Corrigan had access to it and used it , and that none of the others did . Therefore I accept that detail as established , and also the account of Corrigan 's visit to California , but nothing else , and certainly not the authorship . Of course Corrigan did n't write it . " " Why not ? " It came from two of the women in unison . It was the first cheep out of them . " If he did n't know what was in the manuscript , and he did n't , why did he kill people ? There is no discernible reason . If he did n't kill people , why does he confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Did he kill himself ? " Mrs. Adams blurted . She looked ten years older , and she was already old enough . " I should n't think so . If he did , it was he who got me on the phone to hear the shot and told me he had mailed me a letter , meaning this  --  "  | " What 's that ? " Cramer demanded . " He said he had mailed you a letter ? " " Yes . I left that out of my report to you because I do n't want my mail intercepted . He said that . Mr. Goodwin heard it . Archie ? " " Yes , sir . " " And since he did n't write this thing he would hardly tell me he had mailed it to me . No , madam , he did n't kill himself . We might as well deal with that next  --  unless someone wants to maintain that Corrigan wrote the confession ? " No one did . Wolfe took them in . " For this a new character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to be a hodgepodge , partly what he must have done and partly what he could have done . Certainly he spent some hours yesterdaybetween noon and ten in the evening at Corrigan'sapartment , composing and typing this document . Certainly Corrigan was there too . He had been hit on the head , and was either unconscious from the blow or had been tied and gagged . I prefer it that he was conscious , knowing something of X as I do , and that X , as he typed the confession  --  which may have been composed beforehandand merely had to be copied  --  read it aloud to Corrigan . He wore gloves , and , when he was through , he pressed Corrigan 's fingertips to the paper and envelope here and there , certainly on the postage stamp . " I do n't know whether his schedule was left to exigency or was designed , but I would guess the latter , for X is fond of alibis , and we 'll probably find that he has one ready for last evening from nine-thirty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio , if he had n't alreadyp233done so , hit Corrigan on the head again , at the same spot as before , with something heavy and hard enough to stun but not kill , put him on the floor near the telephone , and dialed my number . While talking to me , making the voice unrecognizable with huskiness and agitation , he pressed the muzzle of Corrigan 's own revolver against his head and , at the proper moment , pulled the trigger and dropped the gun and the phone on the floor . He may also have fallen heavily to the floor himself ; I think he would have . If he did he did n't stay there long . I said he was wearing gloves . He made Corrigan 's dead hand grip the gun , put the gun on the floor , and left , perhaps twenty seconds after the shot had been fired . I have n't even inquired if the door had to be locked from the outside with a key ; if it did , X had had ample opportunity to procure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confession , into the nearest mailbox . I lose him at the mailbox . We 'll hear of his next move when we are confronted with his alibi . " Wolfe 's eyes moved . " I invite comment . " Three lawyers spoke at once . Cramer outspoke them . " How much of it can you prove ? " " Nothing . Not a word . " " Then what does it get us ? " " It clears away the rubbish . The rubbish was the assumptionsthat Corrigan wrote that confession and killed himself . I have shown that one is false and the other is not invulnerable . Depriving you of a suicide was simple . Giving you a murder , and a murderer , is harder . May I proceed ? " " If you 've got something better than guesses , yes . " " I 've got a question , " Kustin put in . " Is this a buildup for charging someone in this room with murder ? "  | " Yes . " " Then I want to speak with you privately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indignant . To control his emotions , he closed his eyes and waggled his head . Then he told Kustin dryly , " So you 're beginning to see something , now that I 've cleared away some of the rubbish ? And you 'd like to point at it ? I 'll do the pointing , Mr. Kustin . " His eyes moved . " Before I go on to particulars , another comment . At my first reading of this "  --  he tapped the paper  --  " I saw the flaw that told me that Corrigan had n't written it : his performance in Los Angeles made it obvious that he had never read the manuscript . But it could have been written by you , Mr. Kustin , or you , Mr. Phelps , or you , Mr. Briggs . It could have been any one of you , instead of Corrigan , who had done the deeds which ' this document attributes to Corrigan . That was why it was of first importance to learn if any of you had had access to the typewriter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore had not exposed O'Malley , it was clear that if one of you had committed three murdersit must have been for some other motive than concealmentof a betrayal of your former partner . " " Get down to it , " Cramer growled . Wolfe ignored him . He looked over the heads of the lawyers and inquired abruptly , " Is one of you ladies named Dondero ? " I twisted my neck . Sue was one of the four on the couch . Startled , she stared at him . " Yes , I am . " She was a little flushed and pretty as a picture . " You are Mr. Phelps 's secretary ? " " Yes . " " A week ago Saturday , nine days ago , Mr. Phelps die/tated a brief letter to me , to be sent by messenger . There were enclosures for it  --  items of material written by LeonardDykes , from the files , including a letter of resignation he wrote last July . Do you remember that incident ? " " Yes . Certainly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by the police ; that you have been shown the Dykes letter and your attention has been called to a certain notation , Ps one-forty-six , three , ' in a corner of it , in pencil , in a handwriting resembling Corrigan 's ; and that you state flatly that the notation was not on the letter that Saturday morning when it was sent to me . Is that cor-rect ? " " Yes , it is , " Sue said firmly . " Are you positive the notation was not on the letter at the time you enclosed it in the envelope with the other material ? " " I am . " " You 're a positive person , are n't you , Miss Dondero ? " " Well  --  I know what I saw and what I did n't see . " " Admirable and remarkable . " Wolfe was terse but not hostile . " Few of us can say that and support it . How many typewriters did you use that morning ? " " I do n't know what you mean . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter to me , and you typed it on your machine . Is that right ? " " Yes . " " And you addressed an envelope to me on the same machine ? " " Yes . " " How positive are you of that ? " " I 'm absolutely positive . "  | " How much chance is there that for some trivial reason , no matter what , you used a different machine for addressingthe envelope ? " " Absolutely none . I was there at my desk , and I did the envelope right after I typed the letter . I always do . " " Then we have a problem . " Wolfe opened a drawer of his desk and took out a sheet of paper and an envelope , handling the envelope gingerly , holding it by a corner . " This is the letter and the envelope ; Mr. Goodwin will attestthat and so will I. The variation is apparent to the naked eye , and I have examined them with a glass . They were not typed on the same machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sue exclaimed . " Come here and look at them . No , please , only Miss Dondero . The envelope must not be touched . " I made room for her to get by . She went to his desk and leaned over for a close-up . She straightened . " That 's a differentenvelope . I did n't type that . I always put By Messenger ' in caps and lower case and underline it . That 's all in caps and it 's not underlined . Where did you get it ? " " If you please , Miss Dondero , take your seat . " Wolfe returned the sheet and envelope to the drawer , touching only the tip of the envelope . He waited until Sue was back on the couch and he had her face before he told her , " Thank you for being positive . That 's a help . But you 're sure you put the letter and enclosures into the envelope you had typed ? " " Yes , I am . " " And sealed it ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , or in a basket ? " " No , I did n't . It was to go by messenger , and I had sentp237for one . I went immediately to the anteroom and put it on Blanche 's desk and asked her to give it to the messenger when he came . " " Who is Blanche ? " " The receptionist . Miss Duke . " Wolfe 's eyes moved . " Which of you is Miss Duke ? " Blanche raised a hand , high . " I am . And I get the idea , I 'm quick . You 're going to ask me if I put the stuff in anotherenvelope , and I 'm going to say I did n't . And I do n't know who did . But Mr. O'Malley came and said something about something left out and took the envelope away with him . " " Mr. O'Malley ? " " Yes . " " Did he bring it back ? " " Yes . " " How soon ? How long was he gone with it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . Anyway he brought it back , and when the messenger came I gave it to him . " " Did you notice whether it was the same envelope ? " " My God , no ! " " This is important , Miss Duke . Will you testify that Mr. O'Malley took the envelope from your desk , left the room with it , and shortly returned with it or with a similar one ? " " What do you mean , will I ? I am ! " Wolfe 's eyes left her to move right and back again , still above the heads of the lawyers . " We seem to be solving our problem , " he remarked . " One more detail would help . Clearly we must assume that Mr. O'Malley addressed anotherenvelope and transferred the material to it . If so , it seems likely that one of you ladies saw him do it , thoughp238I do n't know how the typewriters are placed in that office . What about it ? That Saturday morning , nine days ago , did any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " No reply . He had their eyes all right , but not their tongues . He nodded understandingly . " It may be , of course , that he used a machine that was n't under observation . Or he may have been seen by one of the staff who is not present , and that will bear inquiry . But I should make sure that all of you understand the situation . This envelope is vital evidence . If Mr. O'Malley handled it and typed an address on it , it will probably show his prints , for I do n't suppose he wore gloves in the office that morning . Not only that , it will be a simple matter to learn which machine it was written on . If it was a machine that is on the desk of one of you ladies , and you were there that morning , and Mr. O'Malley denies that he used it , you may find yourself in an uncomfortable spot . The police may properly ask  --  " " It was my machine . " It was a sullen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it came from the beautiful Eleanor , of all people . " Ah . May I have your name ? " " Eleanor Gruber . " She muttered it . " You will please tell us about it , Miss Gruber . " " I was at the filing cabinet and he asked if  --  " " Mr. O'Malley ? " " Yes . He asked if he could use my machine , and I said yes . That was all . " " Did he address an envelope on it ? " " I do n't know . I was at the cabinet with my back turned.  |p239I  said it was my machine , but I should have said it may have been . " " There was a supply of the firm 's envelopes in your desk ? " " Certainly . In the top drawer . " " How long was he at it ? " " I do n't  --  very briefly . " " Not more than a minute or so ? " " I said very briefly . I did n't time it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Of course , that only takes seconds . " " Did you see an envelope in his hand ? " " No . I was n't looking . I was busy . " " Thank you , Miss Gruber . I 'm sorry your memory needed jogging , and I 'm glad it 's refreshed . " Wolfe focusedon Conroy O'Malley . " Mr. O'Malley , you ought to have a word . I wo n't frame a tedious detailed question , but merely ask , did you do the things these people say you did that Saturday morning ? " O'Malley was a different man . The bitter twist to his mouth was gone , and so was the sag of his cheeks . He was ten years younger , and his eyes gleamed almost like eyes in the dark with a light on them . His voice had a sharp edge . " I 'd rather listen to you . Until you 're through . " " Very well . I 'm not through . Is it plain that I 'm accusing you of murder ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , detoured around Cramer and Briggs , got an empty chair , put it just behind O'Malley 's right elbow , and sat . O'Malley did n't glance at him . Wolfe was speaking.  | " Manifestly , establishing that O'Malley got at that letter in order to make that notation on it in Corrigan 's hand before it came to me will not convict him of murder . By then all of you had heard the title of Baird Archer 's novel , Put Not Your Trust , ' and anyone could have known or learned that it came from the third verse of the Hundred and Forty-sixth Psalm . But it shows that he wanted to present me with evidence that someone in your office was connected with the manuscript and therefore with the crimes , and that that someone was Corrigan . I am going  --  " " Why Corrigan ? " Kustin demanded . " That 's what I 'm coming to . I 'm going to have to tell you things I ca n't prove , as I did with X. It is still X , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this confession is that nearly every detail of it is true and strictly accurate . The man who wrote it did find the manuscript in Dykes 's desk and read it ; he found that its contents were as described ; he went to see Dykes and talked with him as related ; he killed Dykes essentially for the reason given , fear of what might result from his knowledge of the contentsof the manuscript ; he killed Miss Wellman and Miss Abrams for a like reason . But it was O'Malley who wrote the confession . He  --  " " You 're crazy , " Kustin blurted . " The manuscript revealedthat Corrigan had informed on O'Malley . Is that right ? " " Yes . " " And O'Malley learned that fact by finding and reading the manuscript ? " " Yes . " " So he killed three people to keep it from being knownp241that Corrigan had informed on him ? For God 's sake ! " " No . He killed three people so he could safely kill a fourth . " Wolfe was on his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had ruined his career , destroyed him , he determined to kill Corrigan . But no matter how cleverly he managed it , Dykes would be an intolerable menace . Dykes knew that O'Malley knew of Corrigan 's treachery , and if Corrigan met a sudden and violent death , no matterhow , Dykes might speak . So first Dykes had to go , and he did . Then Joan Wellman  --  was she also a menace ? O'Malley had to find out , and he arranged to meet her . He may have thought he intended her no harm  --  the confessionsays so  --  but when she spoke of the resemblance of the novel 's plot to an event in real life , and even came close to remembering his name , that , as the confession says , was more than enough for him . Five hours later she was dead . " There was a noise from the rear of the room , the sound of a chair scraping . John R. Wellman was on his feet and moving . Eyes went to him . Wolfe stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side , around the corner and along the wall to the chair which Purley Stebbins had vacated . It had an unobstructed view of the lawyers . " Excuse me , " he said , apparently to everyone , and sat . There were murmurs from the women . Cramer shot a glance at Wellman , evidently decided that he was not getting set as a nemesis , and looked at Wolfe . " There remained , " Wolfe resumed , " only one source of possible danger , Rachel Abrams . O'Malley had probably been told about her by Dykes , but whether he had or not , he had found the receipts she had given Baird Archerp242when he searched Dykes 's apartment . I 'll read a few lines from the confession . " He fingered the sheets , found the place , and read : " My inner being could not permit me to feel any moral repulsion at the thought of killing Joan Wellman , certainly not enough to restrain me , for if killing her was morally unacceptable how could I justify the killing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After that , given adequate motive , I could have killed any number of people without any sign of compunction . So in contemplating the murder of Rachel Abrams my only concerns were whether it was necessary and whether it could be performed without undue risk . I decided it was necessary . " Wolfe looked up . " This is indeed a remarkable document . There we have a man relieving his mind , perhaps even soothing his soul , by coolly expounding the stages of his transformation into a cold-blooded killer , but avoidingthe consequent penalty by ascribing the deeds and the onus to another person . It was an adroit and witty stratagem , and it would have triumphed if Mr. Wellman had not engaged my services and remained resolute in spite of repeated checks and disappointments . " But I 'm ahead of myself . This confession is all right as far as it goes , but it leaves gaps . By the day he went for Rachel Abrams , the twenty-sixth of February , two weeks ago today , she was more than a remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Malley ? " Kustin cut in . " Yes . " " Then you 're talking too fast . O'Malley was in Atlanta two weeks ago today . "  |p243Wolfe  nodded . " I 'll get to that . By that day he knew that I was on the case and was concentrating on Baird Archer and the manuscript , and the possibility that I might find Rachel Abrams certainly did not escape him . He had to deal with her first , and he did  --  a scant two minutes before Mr. Goodwin reached her . And there he was . The preliminaries were completed . He was ready for what had always been his real objective : the murder of Corrigan . To abandon it was unthinkable , but now it was not so simple . Needing to learn how much I knew , he phoned Corrigan to suggest that all of you should come here and invite my questions , and you came . It may be that my asking to see Dykes 's letter of resignation first gave him the idea of putting it all onto Corrigan ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he contrived to put that notation in Corrigan 's hand on the letter before it reached me , as the first step . " Wolfe paused to glance at Wellman , but our client was merely gazing at O'Malley , with no apparent intention of taking part . He went on . " When the police confronted you with the notation , of course O'Malley had to join you in your claim of ignorance and your charge that I must have made the notation myself . Then came the letter from Mrs. Potter , and naturally that suited him admirably . He knew it was a decoy , either mine or Mr. Cramer 's , for he was confident that all copies of the manuscript had been destroyed . I have had no report of your conference that day , but I would give odds that he maneuvered with all his dexterity to arrange that Corrigan should be the one to go to California . The result met his highest expectations . On Corrigan 's return you came together to see me again and , as it seemed to O'Malley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that I was about ready to act . That made the threat , to whoever was its object , ominous and imminent ; that made it most plausible that Corrigan , granting he was the object , would prefer selfdestructionand would choose that moment for it ; and O'Malley moved swiftly and ruthlessly . It was only ten hours after he left here with you that he dialed my numberto let me hear the shot that killed Corrigan . " " You foresaw that ? " Kustin demanded . " Certainly not . At the time you left here I had added only one presumption to my scanty collection : that Corriganhad never seen the manuscript and did n't know what was in it . Regarding the rest of you I was still at sea . I was still merely trying to prod you into movement , and it ca n't be denied that I succeeded . Are you ready to say something , Mr. O'Malley ? " " No . I 'm still listening . " " As you please . I 'm about through . " Wolfe looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta the day Rachel Abrams was killed . Can you certify that , or do you only mean that he was supposed to be ? " " He was there on business for the firm . " " I know . In fact it is not true that my eye on you gentlemenhas been totally impartial until two days ago . The first time you came here O'Malley managed to get it on the record with me that he had returned to New York only that morning after a week in Georgia , and I noted it . I do n't suppose you know Saul Panzer ? " " Saul Panzer ? No . " " That is Mr. Panzer , there at the end of Mr. Goodwin 's desk . If he ever wants to know anything about you , tell him ; you might as well . Four days ago I asked him to investigateO'Malley 's movements during the week in question , and he has done so . Saul , tell us about it . " Saul got his mouth open but no words out , because Cramer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Panzer ! " To Wolfe : " Is this what you got on the phone this morning ? " " Yes . " " And you 're going to hand it to him like this ? Just dump the bag for him ? You are not ! " Wolfe shrugged . " Either I go on or you do . This morningyou said you would take a hand and I said no . Now you 're welcome . Take it if you want it . " " I want it . " Cramer was on his feet . " I want that letter and envelope . I want Panzer . I want statements from the three women . Mr. O'Malley , you 'll go downtown with Sergeant Stebbins for questioning . " O'Malley was not impressed . " On what charge , Inspec-tor ? " " I said for questioning . If you insist on a charge you 'll get one . " " I would want my counsel present . " " You can phone him from the District Attorney 's office . " " Luckily I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " O'Mallev turned his head . " Louis ? " Kustin , meeting his former associate 's eye , did n't hesitate . " No , " he said flatly . " I 'm out , Con . I ca n't do it . " It put O'Malley off balance , but it did n't floor him . He did n't try to press , Kustin 's tone having settled it . He turned back to Cramer , but his view was obstructed . John R. Wellman had left his chair and was standing there facinghim , and spoke . " I 'm Joan Wellman 's father , Mr. O'Malley . I do n't know ,  |p246because  it 's pretty complicated , but I 'd like to see something . I 'd like to see if you feel like shaking hands with me . " He extended his hand . " There it is . Do you feel like it or do n't you ? " Into the heavy silence came a smothered gasp from one of the females . O'Malley nearly made it . He tried . Looking up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck muscles gave , his head dropped , and he used both hands to cover his face . " I guess you do n't , " Wellman said , and turned and headed for the door.  |p247One  day last week I made a station-to-station call to a number in Glendale , California . When I got it I began , " Peggy ? This is Archie . Calling from New York . " " Hello , Archie . I was thinking you might call . " I made a face . I had been familiar deliberately , with a specific purpose , to find a flaw . There was just a chance she might fake indignation , or she might be coy , or she might even pretend not to know who it was . Nothing doing . She was still her  --  too short , too plump , and too old , but the one and only Mrs. Potter . " It 's all over , " I told her . " I knew you 'd want to know . The jury was out nine hours , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As you know , he was tried for Rachel Abrams , not your brother , but that does n't make any difference . Convicting him for one was convicting him for all four . " " Yes , of course . I 'm glad it 's over . Thank you for calling . You sound so close , as if you were right here . " " Yeah , so do you . What 's it doing out there , raining ? " " Oh , no , bright sunshine , warm and bright . Why , is it raining in New York ? " " It sure is . I guess I bring it on . Do you remember how I looked that day through the peephole ? " " I certainly do ! I 'll never forget it ! " " Neither will I. Good-by , Peggy . "  | " Good-by , Archie .
