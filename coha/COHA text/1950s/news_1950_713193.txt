txt Because of the sudden rush of events that adds an election of a New York City Mayor to the November calendar , the chairmen of the political parties are seized with a greater responsibility than usual , it seems to us , in the naming of slates . The great majority of our citizens can take no direct part , at this preliminary stage , in choosing the candidates for major city and state offices . The field in both major parties for the offices of Governor , United States Senator , and Mayor of New York seems to be fairly wide open , except as to the Republican candidate for Governor and the Democratic candidate for Senator . Many possibilities are mentioned . This is all to the good . Too early a foreclosure of choice is detrimental . Delay can do no harm . It may even make its contribution to good government , which is , . tter all , the citizen 's goal in the cidinocratic process , whatever the politician 's aim is . The Republicans have a fresh and unexpected opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from office . We might have expected that this would be received with rejoicing . On the contrary , if we read the signs correctly , the event seems to have spread something very much like dejection . Yet this picture might be changed almost overnight , we would surmise , if the right man could be brought forward to run for Mayor . There appears to be a Republican tendency to avoid alliance with the Liberal party on the city race , and yet one need only look back at the figures of the 1949 election to be newly reminded how essential such alliance is for success against a Tammany candidate . Newbold Morris received 570,713 votes on the Republican line at the last election ; he had 373,287 on the Liberal line . Mayor O'Dwyer polled 1,266,512 as a Democrat . Vito Marcantonio of the American Labor party received 356,626 votes . It is obvious that only a fusion of the Republican , Liberal and other independent elem4nts can win the coming election for Mayor , if the office is to be taken away from the Democratic party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 in the political primer to look for a candidate who would entourage the Liberal party , to turn in the Republican direction . To fail to do so is to write off New York City automatically and to place a heavy liability against Republican chances for carrying the state as well . As firm believers in the two-party political system we can only view with concern an attitude of resignation or defeatism this year that would tend to confirm New York City as almost permanently in the Democratic column . If the prospect at the moment is for only a half-hearted effort by Republicans to win the city election , it must be deplored by all those who are interested in good government . We hope that the present appearance of apathy is deceptive , and that with the final choice of a candidate and the defining of issues a constructive , two-sided contest will emerge . The independent voter would then have a real choice . - There are various aspects of the current situation that must cause concern in those whose only desire is to see fitness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among these is the frequently mentioned necessity , as the Democrats particularly seem to see it , of picking a " balanced " ticket . This means that the choice places must be nicely rationed out , to avoid hurting anybody 's feelings , as to religion , race and borough . It means that if the best three men for Governor , Senator and Mayor all happened to be of one faith , that would n't do at all . It means that we would have to go down into second and third best , if necessary , to be sure that Protestant , Irish Catholic , Italian Catholic and the Jewish faith were somehow taken care of . But even that would not be enough , because Brooklyn , Manhattan , the Bronx and Queens must also have their cut in the political pie . If this seems , to the layman , to make the game of New York politics a little complicated , the assumption is correct . There is no indication , however , that it makes for better government .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
