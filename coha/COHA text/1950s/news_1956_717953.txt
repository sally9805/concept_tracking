txt The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff declared today that the West 's military position was far stronger than its political and diplomatic position relative to the Soviet Union . The chairman , ? Admiral Arthur W. Radford , told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee : " It is in the political and diplomatic fields that we have to worry . " The West 's situation in long terms is more dangerous than a year ago , he asserted , in. part because Soviet propaganda has become more clever . Admiral Radford added : " We have to improve our performance in the information and diplomatic fields . We should not be complacent . We have a great deal of work to do . " Admiral Radford and Charles E. Wilson , Secretary of Defense , supported the Administration 's request for a $4,900,000,000 foreign aid program . Of this some $3,000,000,000 would be for military assistance . The appropriation for the fiscal year of 1956 , which ends June 30 , was for $2,700,000,000 . Secretary Wilson asserted that any substantial reduction in the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the free world . Such an action by Congress . would force " a complete reevaluation of our own international position and of our own military budgets , " he added . Both expressed some anxiety  --  the admiral more pointedly ? that the apparent switch of Russian tactics from overtly military to ostensibly economic penetration might weaken or already had weakened the West 's defensive preparations . They testified before Moscow 's announcement that it was reducing its armed forces by 1,200,000 men . Each , however , already had shown skepticism toward Russian peace gestures . Both assured the committee that United States air power was generally superior to the Soviet Union 's . Secretary Wilson emphasized , that this was " not a great big superiority . " He declined to rate the two countries in certain important specifics . He refused , for example , to say in public how this country 's greatest long - range bombing weapon , the B-52 , stood against the Russian intercontinental bomber , the Bison . Admiral Radford was a shade more confident in his general estimate . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " he commented . " I see no reason why they should get into that position . I believe we will be able to stay ahead . " The reasons for that statement I can give in executive closed session . " Increased Aid Favorable The implication was that this country had been doing better than the public knew , President Eisenhower himself observed on May 4 that the nation would feel much better when it knew the whole story . Air power apart , however , both Secretary Wilson and Admiral Radford repeatedly emphasized that this was the time for an incrase rather than a diminution in military id to the nation 's allies . The admiral 's long testimony reflected anxiety that the dpilomatic progress of this country and its associates was not keeping up with military progress . The tone of what he had to say , and some of his words , seemed at variance with the more optimistic recent forecasts of political leaders . Admiral Radford was in no sense rebellious in manner but he was consistently critical of what he termed the political shortcomings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee that this country did not know the portent of recent Soviet shifts in policy the generally more peaceful front being put on by Russia , its economic assistance proposals , etc. and that it would be profoundly unwise to assume any lessening of the military peril . The admiral went farther , ob-serving : " We must not allow ourselves and our friends in other free nations to fall into the trap that is being staked out for us . " We have been successful , despite many setbacks , in building up military strength in exposed areas of the free world . * * * We should not now be lulled into complacency . * * * " Military aggression will continue to be a potent weapon in the Communist arsenal , one they would not hesitate to use whenever it would gainfully suit their purpose .
