Four-hand piano playing , as it is practiced by most amateurs , is a little like a doubles match with everyone serving at the same time . But when two good professional pianists take time to master the exacting technique of playing together at the same keyboard , the result is often music-making of high order . Last week Manhattan audiences had a chance to hear the best four-hand team since the late , famed Josef Lhevinne played with his wife Rosina . Occasion : a concert at Carnegie Hall by young Viennese Pianists Joerg Demus and Paul Badura-Skoda . <P> Limited Repertory . Seated on separate benches . Pianists Demus and Badura-Skoda worked their way through five little-heard pieces from the limited repertory of original four-hand works . The five : Mozart 's Sonata in C. K.521 , Hindemith 's Sonata for Four Hands , three works by Schubert ( who wrote more four-hand music than any other major composer ) . In some pieces , Demus played " low " ( the bass part ) and Badura-Skoda " high " ( the treble ) , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tends to underpedal to avoid thickness , the pedaling throughout was done by the treble player . When they intertwined their arms in passages of labyrinthine difficulty , the pair presented the bewildering aspect of a two-headed Siva . <P> But the sound they produced was clean , relaxed , admirably unblurred . The music for the most part was richly ornamented , to take full advantage of the presence of 20 fingers on 88 keys . Demus and Badura-Skoda executed filigreed turns of Mozart , trickily syncopated rhythms of Hindemith , florid , zestful melodies of Schubert with a fine fluency and flair . Each throttled his individual sound , avoiding the pounding effect that often afflicts duo pianists playing on separate instruments . <P> Grand Tradition . Pianists Demus , 30 , and Badura-Skoda , 31 , met at Vienna 's Academy of Music , started playing together purely for relaxation . Although they have made half a dozen recordings together ( for Westminster ) , they still regard their four-hand playing as " amateur in the best sense , " prefer to concentrate on their individual careers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quicker fingers " ) , while Demus concentrates more on Schumann and the French repertory . <P> Chiefly because they were both schooled in " the sonority of the grand tradition , " they find that their general approach to music is remarkably similar . Even so , they have problems . " Please , Paul , " cries Demus when he is not getting enough pedal , " I 'm starving . " Occasionally , they get their signals crossed : once , each waited " for a terrible moment " for the other to make a solo entrance , finally came in together . But such lapses are rare , and none but the sharpest critical ears have managed to detect them . The reason , Badura-Skoda points out , is that most of the music they play is from a literature totally unfamiliar to modern audiences . " What we are doing , " he says proudly , " is a very old-fashioned thing . "
