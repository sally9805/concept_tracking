The cold wave hurt most in Florida , frost-singed nearly to its tip . Since December , southern Florida has had six freezes ( three more than in any year since records began some 90 years ago ) , and weathermen are marking this as the state 's worst winter . <P> With an estimated 75% of their midwinter vegetable crop irretrievably gone , Dade County farmers ruefully reckoned losses at $25 to $30 million , hoped that the remaining 25% would not be lost . The effect was quickly felt in scanty offerings , high prices at fresh-vegetable counters in the North and East . In January a year ago , 1,787 railroad carloads of Florida-grown fresh beans , spinach , corn , new potatoes , tomatoes and other vegetables moved to market . Last month the flow was 736 carloads . <P> Smoke for Heat . Many fought back at the cold . Around the Lake Okeechobee area , vegetable growers tried desperately to warm the land by raising the level of water in the canals , or plowing soil loosely over young tomato plants for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fruit and leaves , lit smudge pots , and when these gave out , blackened the sky by burning old auto tires . Preliminary estimates of the citrus-crop loss , on the low side , showed that the expected 142,500,000-box yield of oranges , grapefruit and tangerines has been cut back to 119,400,000 boxes . Federal and state laws prohibit selling as fresh any fruit that falls to the ground , but some growers hid damaged fruit under a layer of good fruit to smuggle it past inspectors and take advantage of premium prices farther north . <P> Cattlemen also were hard hit . In recent years Florida 's year-round pasturage , which normally eliminates the need of laying by hay and feed for winter , has helped make the state an important beef producer . Last week Florida 's 1,400,000 head of Brahmas , Santa Gertrudis , Herefords and Aberdeen-Anguses were so weakened by malnutrition and weeks of slushing around in soggy pastures that cattlemen feared deaths would reach 270,000 . Deaths already had decimated Collier County 's 25,000 herd , and the area 's spring calf crop was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 cows , v. 75 in normal years . A pilot who flew over the ranch area said he saw dead and dying cattle " in every direction . It is a field day for the buzzards . " <P> Thicker than Salve . In Miami , the gloom was thicker than the anti-sunburn salve of good years . With many a smaller hotel discreetly advertising steam heat , the bigger hotels plugged morning movies and bridge tournaments for guests unable to stay outside , reported business off 20% to 30% . But some hotelmen quickly slashed rates , even offered free airline transportation for wives . Miami hoped there might still be a long late season , if the weather should moderate . But last week the new 30-day long-range weather forecast predicted subnormal temperatures through mid-March . <P> " We may keep on getting one cold spell after another for a long time , " warned Miami 's U.S. Weatherman Leonard Pardue . " The cold air is piled up a mile high in Canada , and it can keep right on coming down here . The best we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunny days at a time . "
