A police summons was issued for Aneurin Bevan. charging him with dangerous driving and failure to stop after an accident . The accident , near London , was a minor affair , but it was not the only charge of recklessness made last week against Nye Bevan . <P> Commentators and columnists , Conservative or Socialist , everywhere condemned the manner , and frequently the matter , in Bevan 's abrupt split with Labor Party Leader Clement Attlee ( TIME , April 26 ) over approval of German rearmament and of U.S. leadership in world politics . Admitted the leftist New Statesman &; Nation : " By this impulsive gesture , Mr. Bevan has postponed-possibly forever-his own chances of succeeding to the Socialist leadership . " " It is the future existence of the party itself which is at stake , " said the Times in alarm . If Bevan could swing the party to support " a British neutralism " between the U.S. and Russia , " the leadership would be his reward , ' ' noted the Manchester Guardian , " but there is nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bitterest of all was the Laborite tabloid Daily Mirror ( circ. 4,500,000 ) : " Again he has shown that the greatest blunder the party could make would be to elect him leader . . . For who can follow a whirlwind ? How can a man who does not give loyalty expect to command loyalty from others ? " <P> But there was also evidence that Nye had struck a popular chord among the millions of Britons who fear Germany , resent the U.S. and think that the Communists would behave better if not antagonized . Nye 's opposition to German rearmament was supported 2 to 1 by the convention of the Cooperative Party , which controls 18 Labor seats in Parliament , by delegates of Britain 's sixth largest union , and by the Labor Party of Northern Ireland in convention . <P> Many such voters would follow Nye Bevan on no other issue . But Bevan was quite happy to claim them all . Politically , his driving might be dangerous , but it was no accident .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
