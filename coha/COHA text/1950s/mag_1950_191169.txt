A big-time football official combines the judicial integrity of a Supreme Court Justice with the physical agility of a gymnast ; he must be able to keep 22 high-strung and violent athletes from beating one another 's brains out ; he must be instantly ready to use any one of 24 signals to indicate any of 61 fouls and penalties ; he must know the complex rule book of football by heart . As one of the top men in the trade , Referee Paul Swaffield sums it up with a craftsman 's pride : " You ca n't very well be a dummy and be a referee . " In exchange for his package of virtues , the good football official gets the reward of an afternoon 's exercise , a nice ( up to $125 ) fee and his name in small type at the bottom of the program . <P> This week in Philadelphia , 56-year-old Referee Swaffield will bind up a game left leg with twelve yards of adhesive tape , then gallop up &; down Municipal Stadium for some six miles before 100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be watching the Army-Navy game and the four stripe-shirted officials will be just mobile scenery , chiefly worth attention only if they commit bloopers or get knocked down and run over by a power play . <P> No Accident . Stocky , firm-jawed Referee Swaffield has a reputation for avoiding that sort of attention . A Watertown , Mass , businessman ( advertising manager for Hood Rubber Co. ) five days a week , Swaffield has spent most of his football-season Saturdays for 24 years learning to be both omnipresent and inconspicuous . He was never a college football star himself , though he did earn baseball and basket letters at Brown ( ' 16 ) and played enough football to get " the feel " of it . Like his fellow officials , he started with high school and frosh games , graduated in time to the college circuit . This year , for the first time in his career , Swaffield drew the top assignment in the control of the Eastern Intercollegiate Football Association , the Army-Navy game . <P> The choice of Swaffield , made months in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual officials and the coaches of the rival teams mail brief reports to the Eastern Association office , rating the officiating as satisfactory or not-and , if not , why not . Too many blunders can bounce the blunderer back to the minors or right off the roster of officials . <P> No Total Warfare . " The cardinal sin of a football official , " says Swaffield , " is to be out of position . " At the Army-Navy game , his position will be directly behind the offensive team , where he can watch the play develop and follow it downfield , " on top of it " all the way . Each of the other three officials has his standard starting spot : the umpire behind the defensive line , the head linesman sighting along the line of scrimmage for offside violations , the field judge back of the defensive secondary to watch for kicks , forward-pass plays and downfield interference . <P> Rule No. 1 for a football official , says Swaffield , " is to make an immediate decision and never take any back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The official who bellows at the boys just makes them antagonistic . " Swaffield prefers to kid the players along , make them loosen up and remember that football is just a game , not total warfare .
