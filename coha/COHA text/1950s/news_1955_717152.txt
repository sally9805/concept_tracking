txt Traffic Commissioner T. T. Wiley started yesterday to develop a new pattern for Columbus Circle to meet the traffic demands that will be posed by the Coliseum there . The ' $35,000,000 convention and ' exhibition hall and its related skyscraper will not be in use until next March but the Commissioner said it was essential to start redesigning the complex interchange now . " Everybody would be on our necks  --  and have a right to be ? if we waited till the project was completed to make our plans , " he said . Noting that the Coliseum would attract thousands of additional persons to the congested /section , Mr. Wiley said he had ' initiated two steps now . Several more measures are scheduled for early action to insure smooth traffic flow in the Circle area . Today , Mr. Wiley will meet with executives of the New York City ' Omnibus Corporation to discuss bus , line operations on the West Side in general and the controversial Seventh and Eighth Avenues situation in particular . The bus company has contended that the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply into revenue without accomplishing their purpose of improving traffic movement . The bus operators urge tile restoration of the two-way pattern that prevailed until June 5 , 1954 , although they concede there is little likelihood of going back to the old days . Mr. Wiley hopes to persuade them to mark time while he develops a new Columbus Circle pattern and , equally important , gets on with an over-all plan that he believes will not hurt the bus system while helping all traffic in Manhattan . The second immediate step has been to assign Deputy Commissioner Dwight T. Myers , the Traffic Department 's chief engineer , to confer with civic groups that have been pressing Mr. Wiley for action at the Circle . Mr. Myers is to meet this afternoon with officials of the Broadway Association for a discussion of the thorny issue . Other Agencies to Help Next week , the Commissioner said , he will invite the heads of city agencies involved in traffic to have their own engineers work on various facets of the problem in cooperation with Mr. Myers . At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its key technicians to work on a new plan for channeling traffic coming out of the Holland Tunnel . There is a definite relationship between the tunnel and the Circle , four miles north . It dovetails with Commissioner Wiley 's master plan that envisions fixing the Circle as one segment of over-hauling traffic patterns in Manhattan completely . If legal , fiscal and physical hurdles can be bridged , the Commissioner said , he wants to reverse the flow of Seventh and Eighth Avenues so that Seventh Avenue will handle northbound instead of southbound flow , with the reverse operation on Eighth Avenue . This also would compel reversing the one-way pattern of Ninth-Columbus and Tenth-Amsterdam Avenues . Ninth Avenue now is one-way southbound and Tenth one-way northbound . The key to the one-way redision on the West Side lies in bringing Broadway into the network of one-way longitudinal routes . Originally it was planned to let Broadway alone , but Mr. Wiley has worked out a switchback pattern that he contends may make it feasible to include the city 's only diagonal through route in the one-way program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the artery one-way northbound and other parts one-way southbound , the Commissioner said traffic jams might be unlocked at Columbus Circle and other critical points such as Times Square , Herald Square and Madison Square . Other Avenues Involved In addition to the avenues now limited to one-way flow the proposed new set-up would involve Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas . No changes from the original program set up four years ago are contemplated for the East Side . The Port Authority would come into the picture because vehicles coming from Jersey make their exit at Varick Street , the southern part of the onr-way Seventh Avenue southbound operation that extends as far downtown as the junction of ' West Broadway and Franklin Street . Cars , trucks and buses coming out of the tube must head south or take a horseshoe path to keep in the traffic stream . If Varick Street is realigned for northbound flow a major change must be made at the tunnel plaza . In hopes of expediting ' action on the over-all program , Mr. Wiley said he would ask the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $500,000 additional allotted to his agency for the fiscal year starting July 1 . The money to be appropriated in stages would be earmarked to set up a comprehensive planning section of fifteen men and to provide the best scientific equipment for them . Mr. Wiley said he considered Columbus Circle the most complex intersection in Manhattan , if not in the entire five boroughs . He noted that it had been rebuilt and its traffic pattern altered on several occasions in the last twenty-five years . About the only thing constant these is the marble statue of Columbus , erected in 1892 , and there have been suggestions that the tall shaft should be moved as an aid to motor vehicle flow . The monument and its small park setting is not the problem , in Mr. Wiley 's opinion . The headache , he said , is the eight prongs of roads that go through or touch the tip of the big Circle . While the present pattern is admittedly " imperfect , " it is " the best of the many experiments tried over the years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coliseum said it still expected to meet its target date of March 1 , 1956 , despite the time loss resulting from the collapse of a floor last May 9.
