txt Congress overrode President Eisenhower 's second veto of the public works bill today . Thus , for the first time during his tenure , a bill becomes law without his signature . Applause rippled through the Senate galleries and a thunder of applause and whoops rolled across the floor of the House of Representatives as the results were announced . For the Democrats , who had been beaten in four earlier attempts to override vetoes this year , it was a sweet , if minor , victory . The amount of money in dispute between the White House and Congress was relatively small by Federal spending standards . The bill provides a total of S1,185,000,000 for construction projects throughout the nation . But for a Congress that had been beaten to the point of humiliation by vetoes and threats of vetoes , the taste of victory was obviously satisfying . 145 Vetoes Upheld Since taking office in 1953 , the President had vetoed 145 bills and had made every veto stand . But the string ended with the 146th . His defeat today resulted from Republican defections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare coalition of Northern and Southern Democrats . The pattern of Eisenhower victories in Congress this year has been a solid Republican front merged I with a high percentage of Southern Democrats . At the White House , James C. Hagerty , Presidential press secretary , was asked for President Eisenhower 's reaction . Mr. Hagerty said the President thought ' ' the lure of the , pork barrel was a little too much for Congress to avoid . " Representative John W. McCormack of Massachusetts , the // House Democratic leader , replied that Mr. Hagerty 's comment was " below the dignity of a President and appears to me to be sour grapes . " The White House gibe at the " pork , barrel " was an allusion to the ancient Congressional custom of apportioning the bill 's construction projects so that virtually every Congressman 's constituency benefits . Congressmen condemn the phrase as unfair and misleading . President Eisenhower 's objecLion to the bill was based on its budgeting of sixty-seven new projects , which would cost about $800,000,000 to complete over an extended period , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisiana , said it was " absurd " for the President to balk at this level of new domestic spending when he had requested $800,000,000 for this fiscal year alone for " foreign public works . " Mr. Ellender referred to the Administration 's request for $835,000,000 for defense support under the foreign aid program . This is money that the Government grants to certain of its under-developed military allies as economic aid . The first version of the works bill was vetoed Aug. 28 becaus4 of the sixty-seven unbudgeted projects . Congress refused to abandon a single one . Instead , It made a cut of 21 , per cent in the amount provided for each project , including the new ones , in the fiscal year 1960 . This . was approved by both Houses on Tuesday and vetoed yesterday . Text of Veto Message The veto message read as follows : " On Aug. 28 , 1959 , I returned to the Congress without my approval H. R. 7509 , a bill making appropriations for civil functions administered by the Department of the Army , certain agencies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authority , for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1960 , and for other purposes . " H. R. 9105 which is now before me , is identical to H , R. 7509 in all respects ( including the sixty-seven unbudgeted projects which will ultimately cost our taxpayers more than $800 , - 000,000 ) , except that each individual project and appropriation item has been reduced by 2% per cent . This only change not only fails to meet any of the objections I outlined in my mes- , sage of Aug , 28 , 1959 , accompanying H. R. 7509 , but in ' addition could have the effect ) of impeding orderly work on going projects and result in an increase in costs instead of a saving . " Therefore , for the reasons outlined in such previous message . I am returning H. R. 9105 to the Congress without my approval , " Because the time before the probable adjournment of Congress may be too short to allow for deliberate reconsideration by the Congress of my objections , the Congress might well enact a continuing resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in progress may proceed in an orderly way . " When the House met at noon , the veto message was waiting at the door . Thronged galleries laughed as the doorkeeper , N. Miller , dashed down the aisle to put the paper on the desk . Speaker Sam Rayburn called for a vote and the rollcall began without debate . Altogether , twenty Republicans voted against the President , including eleven who had supported him on the earlier showdown . With the Democrats holding all but five of their I Southern bloc , the Republicans supplied the extra votes needed to override . The finaP tally , 280 to 121 , was thirteen votes more than the two-thirds needed to pass the bill over the President 's objection . At the end , a voice called to the Speaker for a recapitulation . " It 's not close enough for that , " Mr. Rayburn said . At this the Democrats and some Republicans let go with the most exuberant demonstration of cheerwas " a citizen ; a father and a grandfather , " a man " thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . taste immortality when you become ' a grandfather , " he declared . " In a grandchild there reposes every hope , every aspiration , every unrequited ambition a man may have ever I had . " Often , he said , he talked to his own grandchild about the future of the country and . once told the child , " May your grandpa hang his head in shame it he fails to do his duty in his time and in his generation . " " Yet , the Senate would be ! guilty of this very failure if it ignored the veto , " Mr. Dirksen went on . The roll-call vote followed . It was 72 to 23 , or eight more than the required two-thirds . There was no demonstration on the Senate floor except for an outburst of noisy , animated conversation , but there was applause from the galleries . Final action on the public works bill was followed in the House by voice-vote approval of ' the $1,000,000,000 compromise housing bill that had been worked out with the White House Tuesday . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for signature . Although President Eisenhower has vetoed two earlier housing bills , the new measure modifies some objectionable features of the second bill and has been assured of his approval . The only major bill ? still ' awaiting floor action is the annual foreign-aid appropriation . The Senate version carries $3 , - 281,813.000 , about $95,000,0001 more than the House approved. , Once this is disposed of , the ing and handclapping heard in the House this year . It was the first time during the Eisenhower Administration ; that the House had overridden a veto , The action immediately shifted to the Senate , which had overridden the President earlier this year on the veto of a minor administrative bill . That veto was later sustained in the House . Senator Ellender opened a brief debate by denouncing the White House 's attempt to raise appropriations for foreign-aid spending while opposing a rise in domestic expenditures . Then Senator Everett Mc . ' Kinley Dirksen of Illinois , the Republican leader , rose to make ' the final Administration plea . His theme was the Senate 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coura geous " attempt to fulfill that obligation by vetoing the public ' works bill . " The American people , " Mr. ' Dirksen declared , " will applaud the President for his concern for the country and its fiscal integrity through the years ahead . " The President , he went on , last major obstacle to Congressional adjournment will be down . The Senate is barred from tackling it immediately , however , because of Senator Wayne Morse 's insistence on forcing the bill to lie before the Senate three days before action begins . The three-day layover is required by Senate rules , which the Oregon Democrat , in his " parliamentary war , " insists be observed . Unless Senator Morse relents , action can not begin until Saturday morning .
