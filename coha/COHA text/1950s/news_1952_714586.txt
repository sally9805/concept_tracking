txt Outcome of the Massachusetts presidential primaries write-in vote on April 29 mounts in importance daily . Public attention and interest in the forthcoming primaries is mounting as a result of the writein features . Now with the write-in results from the Minnesota and Nebraska primaries playing such an important part in national discussions of respective candidates , both the Taft and Eisenhower forces are stepping up their own drives in Massachusetts for strong showings . Both sides realize the voting at the Republican National Convention will be done by elected delegates , but they also realize those delegates can not ' help being influenced by the results of write-in samples of public opinion , particularly if that expression comes from a large segment of the voters . Senator Robert A. Taft ( R ) of Ohio is coming to Massachusetts on April 17 , 18 and 19 to spur his own campaign . To Use N.H. Strategy But the Eisenhower forces are ready to counteract the effect of a Taft personal visit . They are planning to use the New Hampshire strategy of bringing in top out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is understood among those leaders will be Paul G. Hoffman , former director of the Economic Cooperation Administration and now a top man in the Eisenhower ranks , and Gov . Alfred E. Driscoll of New Jersey . Present plans call for these leaders and others to come into Massachusetts for major rally appearances after Senator Taft completes his three-day tour . Thus they will be in the state the week before the voting . At the same time Bay State forces supporting Senator Estes Kefauver ( D ) of Tennessee for the Democratic nomination are mounting an all-out write-in campaign , complete with stickers which may be attached to the ballot as a substitute for writing in the name of their candidate . A similar plan considered by the Eisenhower forces now has been abandoned . Instead the Eisenhower groups will concentrate on getting their backers to write in the name . They believe the stickers are impractical . Brief Kefauver Visit The Kefauver state organization , which has just opened state headquarters in Boston , realizes that Senator Kefauver 's only hope of an important showing in Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one congressional district is a full Kefauver-pledged slate in the field . The unpledged and unopposed delegate-at-large slate includes one delegate already committed to Senator Kefauver . He is Representative John M. Shea ( D ) of Worcester , chairman of the Massachusetts Kefauver-fcr-President Committee . There are others on the unpledged slates believed leaning to Senator Kefauver and they might be strongly influenced by a , good Kefauver write-in showing . It now appears that Senator Kefauver will make only a one-day nonpolitical appearance in Massachusetts prior to the April 29 primaries . That appearance is scheduled on April 17 when he will address a group of schoolboy editors . Earlier he had planned a real campaign in Massachusetts , but Martin Fay , his New England campaign coordinator ; said campaigns in other states are making a Bay State tour unlikely . With the prospect of picking only a few delegates at best in the . Bay State , the Tennessee senator apparently feels his limited campaign time can be spent more profitable elsewhere .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
