When New Hampshire 's sharp-tongued Senator Styles Bridges charged last November that the Air Force was paying Kaiser-Frazer $1.2 million apiece for the same C-119 Flying Boxcar that Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corp . made for $260,000 , K-F 's President Edgar Kaiser cried foul . He took newspaper ads in ten cities to answer the charges of K-F 's inefficiency ( TIME , Nov. 24 ) and invited a congressional investigation . Last week he got it . <P> A Busy Day . Up before the Senate 's Preparedness subcommittee came Truman 's ex-Under Secretary of Air John McCone , a Los Angeles Republican , ex-steel-man and onetime shipbuilding associate of Henry Kaiser . McCone recited the crowded events of a busy day in December 1950 . In the morning , Kaiser-Frazer got a $25 million RFC loan ; at noon , Henry and Edgar Kaiser met McCone at lunch to ask him about defense work ; in the afternoon , Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corp . was notified by telephone that Henry and Edgar would come out to Hagerstown , Md. next morning to pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> When Fairchild executives protested , McCone assured them that K-F would simply be a secondary source for planes-something the Air Force was trying to set up for all prime contractors . But a few months later , K-F became a prime contractor on its own . It bought working control of Chase Aircraft , whose C-123 is Fairchild 's principal competitor . The decision to give K-F a contract to make Flying Boxcars , said McCone , was made four days before K-F had even submitted its written proposal for one ( Senator Bridges wryly called this " faster than fast " ) . <P> Shop Practices . The contract was let by Lieut . General Orval Cook , then chief of Procurement and Industrial Planning , who admitted that he had done so without ever inquiring into what K-F 's costs for making the plane would be . And he had no records of the Wright Field meeting at which he , McCone and others made the final decision to go ahead . They were using a wire recorder , said General Cook , but " the recording equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were originally estimated at $467,000 . Soon they soared to $902,000 , then to $1.3 million ( slightly higher than Bridges ' estimate ) . By May 1952 , when the original contract was to have been completed , K-F had delivered only one plane . Up to the present , added General Cook , it has delivered only 44 of the 134 planes originally called for . But the Air Force has made no move to cancel the contract in favor of Fairchild , which has already turned out 412 planes . <P> Air Force Auditor Sidney Solomon , who checked the books at K-F 's plant at Willow Run , explained how money flew . For one thing , said he , K-F tried to charge off to the contract $715,631 of vacation pay for workers who had earned it from auto motive work . Other items disallowed : 1 ) $4.2 million of automotive costs , which would have eventually totaled $56 million if not eliminated ; and 2 ) a charge to the Government for 65% of the cost of Kaiser 's ads replying to Senator Bridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
