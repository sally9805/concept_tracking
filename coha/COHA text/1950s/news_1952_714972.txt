txt Wage Stabiliaation Board Chairman Archibald Cox last aught issued a veiled appeal to 3T5.000 soft coal miners to stay at work while the board debates whether to approve the stew $1.10 a day wage settlemeat . Debate starts at P.M. tonight at a special two-hour session . Since last Friday members of the United Mine Workers in scattered coal fields have been on strike to protest operators ' plans to not to pay the raise until the Wage Board has approved it . The =ion denies the strikes are aimed at forcing the board to act quickly and affirmatively on the raise . Mr. Coit , in a formal statement , did not directly ask the miners to stay at work while the W.S.B. deliberates . But he did emphasize that " no one stands to lose while the board takes time to explore the facts thoroughly and to arrive at a decision on the basis of the facts . " Then , observing that the board 's " usual practice is to permit whatever wage increase is approved to be paid retroactive to the date of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker ' have found this practice a sufficient safeguard to permit them to continue defense production without interruption while the board is considering a case . Since last Friday , Mr. Cox stated , when operator and union officials joined in asking the board at a closed hearing to approve the whole raise , ' - the public , industry and labor members of the board have spent every available minute studying the case . " " The case is important , " he went on , " because it involves a basic industa7 employing many thoimands men : The case is also important bemuses the decision . whether the increase is modified or approved in full , will have important consequences for the entire staldffsation program " Rheas are reasons for proceeding to a decision without delay . They are also reasons for calm deliberation . for the avoidance of bast " and for reaching the wisest conclusion we are able : * " I can not predict : * he said , how soon it will take to reach a decision . " I can assure you that the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as posalide consistent with the exercise of calm judgment . " The board 's industry members were reported yesterday planning to insist that the board stick to its rules in deciding the case and thus approve only the amount automatically allowable . Labor members , one of whom said he was " ready to vote now  --  aye , were planning to maintain the whole raise should be approved . Approval of almost the entire increase would , be possible if the board were to use November , 1950. as a base for a cost of living allowance , rather than the usual January , 1951. base date . The sharp rise in living costa between those months would give the miners a substantially greater allowance under W.8.8 . Regulation 8 if the base date were shifted . One argument for shifting the cost of living base is that the miners missed out on a raise altogether in 1949. and this should be considered reason enough for giving them special treatment .                    @
