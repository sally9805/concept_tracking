txt Governor Dewey 's counsel took sharp issue tonight with a statement by Senator Arthur H. Wicks that a bill he had sponsored in 1944 would have barred " the criminal element " from the state 's race tracks if Mr. Dewey had not vetoed it . At a press conference called in response to reporters ' queries after Mr. Wicks ' filmed television appearance this afternoon , George M. Shapiro said that the Senator 's claims for the 1944 measure were " just not accurate . " In a radio-television defense of his Sing Sing visits to Joseph S. Fay , convicted labor extortionist , Mr. Wicks declared that he had sponsored a bill in 1944 that would have required state licensing of all track pari-mutuel employes and restricted licensing to " persons without criminal records . " " If that bill had not been vetoed , " the Senate Majority Leader asserted , " the criminal element could have been barred from the tracks nine years ago . " Mr. Shapiro maintained that an the bill had required of an applicant for a license was residence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state voting or registration record and payment of a fee ranging from $10 to $50 . " Nothing in that bill could have . disqualified a person with a criminal record from a license , " the Governor 's counsel declared . Mr. Dewey watched the Wicks television speech at his farm in Pawling , where he was spending the week-end . Asked if he had any reaction , a spokesman in his office here replied : " The Governor has nothing to add to what he has already said on the subject . " When Senator Wicks ' visits to Fay were disclosed on Oct. 2 , Mr. Dewey said he disapproved and called for a " complete and satisfactory explanation . " After a fourhour conference with Mr. Wicks last Monday , the Governor said he still Wei not satisfied with the Senator 's story or his decision to submit his , resignation to the next session of the Legislature and there seek vindication . Calls Measure ' Defective ' ' With regard to the track licensing legislation proposed by Mr. Wicks in 1944 , Mr. Shapiro said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It contained no standards for the public 's protection , " the Governor 's Counsel added . " There was no requirement in the bill for fingerprinting or any other requirement of evidence of good moral character or lack of a criminal record . " There was absolutely nothing in the bill which would have prevented the labor extortions or labor racketeering at harness tracks involved in the recent disclosures . " In fact , Mr. Shapiro said , approval by the Governor of the measure could have " perpetuated evils that might have been in existence . " He said this might have been accomplished by freezing into their jobs through licensing questionable pari-mutuel employes . The Governor 's counsel recalled that in 1944 harness racing was " in its infancy ' and subject to wartime restrictions , and hired a total of only 130 pari-mutuel employes in the state . Thus , he said , the ? in , in the main , would have affected flat track workers , who so far have not been subject to question in the growing race track investigations . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation , " he declared . Track Unions Split on Bill The measure was approved by both Houses of the Legislature in the dying hours of the 1944 session . It reportedly was backed by the Mutnel Ticket Agents Federal Union , A. F. L. , a state organization , in an effort to promote parimutuel jobs for state residents , and opposed by the Independent Association of Mutuel Employe* , a union of professional pari-mutuel clerks who worked tracks throughout the country .
