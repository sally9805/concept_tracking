Defense Mobilizer Arthur S. Flemming last week handed U.S. oil companies a knotty problem . Foreign oil , said he , is coming into the country too fast . If U.S. companies want to avoid their first taste of Government import curbs , they must cut crude-oil imports voluntarily by 7% during the last quarter of 1955 and the first of 1956 . A House Judiciary subcommittee promptly let out a shout of warning . Asked the subcommittee : How could the oil companies comply without acting in concert and thus violating antitrust laws ? Flemming pointed out that he had merely made a suggestion . <P> Nevertheless , Flemming made it clear that , one way or another , imports must slow down . Too much imported oil , the Administration feels , could discourage growth of domestic exploration and production . Early this year the Administration decided that 1955 crude-oil imports should be roughly 10% of 1954 domestic production . Flemming figures that this year 's April-December imports will average about 740,000 bbls. a day . Approximately half that amount will be Canadian and Venezuelan oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 370,000 , Flemming calculates , must be cut by 7% , or 26,000 bbls. a day , to fall in line with Administration policy . The new limit must hold through first-quarter 1956 . <P> Oil companies will soon be asked to report to Flemming on their efforts to cut imports . If the results do not satisfy the Defense Mobilizer , he will reluctantly launch the Government " down a road of regulation which it has never traveled before . "
