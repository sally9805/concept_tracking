Behind the forbidding stone walls of Jerusalem 's Mea Shearim quarter , hundreds of bearded , ultra-Orthodox scholars study the Torah from morning to night , and wear the fur-trimmed black hats , ankle-length gaberdines and dangling ear-locks of the medieval ghettos . On the Sabbath , the more violent among them have stoned and burned moving vehicles and shattered the windows of homes where radios were playing . The rules of the Torah and the Rabbinate strictly circumscribe the lives of their womenfolk , who must not sit with men , must cover themselves to ankle and wrist . After a rudimentary schooling , Mea Shearim girls stay at home to help their mothers with the housework seven days a week . They may not stroll about the city , dance , see movies , go swimming , or read non-religious books . When they are 17 , the marriage broker comes around . <P> When Premier David Ben-Gurion set out to draft women into the Israel army four years ago , extremist leaders forced him to exempt Orthodox girls . Soon 30% of all girls called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote a new bill which would draft Orthodox girls for work on farms , in hospitals and in immigrant camps , instead of the army . The new bill would not force ultra-Orthodox girls to wear the " unmaidenly " Israeli women 's army uniforms , and would let them return to their own homes at night . Moreover , they would not be controlled by the Defense Minister , but by the motherly Labor Minister , Mrs. Golda Meyerson . Two Orthodox members of the cabinet , and Israel 's Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Halevi Herzog. approved the bill . <P> But the rabbis of the Mea Shearim told their congregations nothing of these compromises . At rallies of the extreme Orthodox , zealots cried that the army was preparing to stock houses of ill-fame with Orthodox girls . On the whitewashed walls of the quarters , posters appeared : " Daughters of Israel Must Prefer the Stake to Conscription . " Yielding to pressure , Rabbi Herzog reversed himself , proclaimed that conscription of females would violate Jewish law . <P> One day last week , as the Knesset debated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from all over Israel converged on Shaarei Hessed Square in the biggest anti-government demonstration in Israel 's troubled history . Red-eyed from weeping , they swayed and wailed , prayed , and blew upon the ram 's horn , a signal of national distress . Despite their prayers , the conscription bill passed the first Knesset reading , 59 to 6.
