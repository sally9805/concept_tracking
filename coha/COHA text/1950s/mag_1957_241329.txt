G.I.s IN FOREIGN COURTS <P> ONE of the most effective ways of breeding enmity among friendly nations is to station the troops of one country on the soil of another in peacetime . The problem is compounded when the foreign troops claim extraterritorial privileges and hold themselves not subject to local law . In the overall grand strategy of the cold war , the U.S. has sought to devise a new and workable solution to the old problems : a worldwide network of " status-of-forces agreements " designed to cover the bulk of 700,000 U.S. soldiers , sailors and airmen stationed in 49 friendly countries . <P> The status-of-forces agreements , in spite of the ruckus over Specialist Third Class Girard in Japan , are working out amazingly well . Status-of-forces agreements have contributed in six years of steady growth toward easing the tensions between allies , and have added up to a remarkable good-sense show of international justice from which the U.S. and its allies alike have benefited . One Girard case provides an uproar in the U.S. and Japan , for example , but 5,544 other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over a longer term , fewer than half a dozen out of 10,000 arrests of Americans in France since 1953 have caused the U.S. any concern . <P> <P> Off Duty , Off Base . Since 1951 , the U.S. has negotiated more than 40 status-of-forces agreements covering most of the world sectors where the U.S. force-in-being is deployed . The basic agreement is the NATO status-of-forces treaty signed in London in 1951 and ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1953 . This NATO treaty grants the U.S. primary jurisdiction over G.I.s in a NATO country who get in trouble while on duty , or who commit offenses against other U.S. citizens . The treaty generally grants the " host " NATO country primary legal jurisdiction when G.I.s commit off-duty , off-base offenses that can range from running red lights to rape . <P> Even this agreed division of responsibility is far from final . A key point of the NATO status-of-forces treaty-the basic principles of which now apply by executive agreement to Japan-is that the host nation agrees to give " sympathetic consideration " to requests for waiver in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance . " As this works out , U.S. authorities usually ask allied countries to waive primary jurisdiction and to return American offenders to the mercies of U.S. courts-martial ; usually the allies comply . Out of all the 14,394 G.I. offenses subject to foreign jurisdiction last year , the allies turned back 9,614 cases to the U.S. <P> <P> Where the host nation keeps jurisdiction , the status-of-forces agreement specifically guarantees each G.I. the essentials of U.S. justice : the right to a fair and speedy trial , to confront hostile witnesses and subpoena friendly witnesses , to choose defense counsel ( which the U.S. pays for ) and to communicate at all times with U.S. Government representatives . A Senate addendum to the NATO treaty further requires the commanding officer of any G.I. in a foreign court to notify the State Department and the Armed Services Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives if he considers that the G.I. 's rights are in jeopardy . Even if the G.I. is convicted and imprisoned , a Pentagon directive prescribes that U.S. representatives must visit him at least once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
