The price for promising Middle East oil concessions is rising so fast that the so-called fifty-fifty profit split is as dead as a dry well . <P> Last week a group of Japanese oilmen won a 2.890-sq. - mi. concession in the Persian Gulf off the neutral zone by contracting to pay 56% of the production profits to the zone 's owners , Kuwait and Saudi Arabia . The deal came just a few days after Standard Oil Co . ( Indiana ) became the first major U.S. company to upset the fifty-fifty pattern . For a 6,177-sq. - mi. concession off Iran 's shores in the gulf . Indiana Standard agreed to pay 75% of profits to Iran , plus a $25 million bonus , and to spend $82 million in exploration and development over the next twelve years . If no oil is found , Indiana will turn over half of the unspent portion of the $82 million to Iran . <P> Other companies had bid against Indiana Standard , offering only the fifty-fifty split . But this was more fiction than fact , because they also offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose the smaller bonus and bigger split , gambling that Standard will find a huge new field . If it fails to , then Iran will lose the gamble . <P> From Teheran to Texas , many an oilman grumbled that the new deals would inspire other oil-rich Middle Eastern countries to cancel their present fifty-fifty deals and demand sweeter contracts . But calmer leaders in the industry brushed such remarks aside . Said Howard Page , Middle East boss for Standard Oil Co . ( New Jersey ) : " Some oilmen say that it is immoral or something to bid in a certain way . Baloney ! I certainly do not want anyone to tell us how we can bid . "
