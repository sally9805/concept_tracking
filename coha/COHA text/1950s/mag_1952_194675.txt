( See Cover ) <P> In the great gamble of oil , one of the world 's biggest winners is a chance-taker named Alfred Jacobsen . His rule for success is simple : " If you do n't want to take risks , you ca n't make money . If you have n't the courage to lose , stay out of oil . " <P> Jacobsen , a tall ( 6 ft. 1 in. ) , spare man with a lined , ascetic face , bright brown eyes and explosive energy , has the courage to take big risks , and when necessary , the courage to lose . But he wins far oftener than he loses . He wins because he hunts oil in the ground with the same passion and dedication that inspired Captain Ahab , an oil hunter of another day , in his pursuit of Moby Dick . By so dedicating himself , Alfred Jacobsen has made his Amerada Petroleum Corp . the most famed independent oil hunter in the oil industry . Amerada , at 185 , is the seventh highest priced common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1,526 listed stocks , Amerada is the No. 1 favorite of the investment trusts . <P> Last week Hunter Jacobsen was busy , as usual , indulging his passion . In Oklahoma , he was drilling four wells ; in California , three ; in Louisiana , one ; in New Mexico , nine ; and in Canada , four . He was busiest of all in North Dakota . There , he was drilling 20 wells . For in North Dakota 's Williston Basin , Jacobsen has made his biggest strike . He has found many a new oilfield in the past . But in North Dakota he found something far bigger . Says he : " The Williston Basin is not just one oilfield . It is an oil province . " <P> The Gold-Dust Bowl . In that province last week , above the ocean flatness of North Dakota 's wheat and cattle plains , flaming gas flares from 69 Amerada wells stabbed the night sky . The land that had been a dust bowl only 20 years ago was now an El Dorado to many farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Overnight , they had become wealthy . Last week the big opportunity had come for Farmer Lewis M. Osborn . <P> Working day &; night , Amerada 's drillers had driven a three-cone rotary rock-bit deeper &; deeper into the earth of Osborn 's farm . The rig 's platform throbbed with the clanking rumble of a diesel engine spinning the drill . As the drill bit down into the earth , new lengths of 60-ft. pipe were threaded on to join the mile-and-a-half of pipe already whirling below ground in a single , continuous column . At 8,663 ft. the drilling was stopped , the drill pulled out . Hurriedly the hole was cased with seven-inch pipe and capped . Then , when all was ready , the cap was opened . With a great hiss , jets of water and drilling-mud shot out of the hole . For a few minutes there was just the steady hissing of moist gas , smelling like rotten eggs . Then came the oil-a greenish-yellow stream . Amerada had brought in its 70th Williston producer , and Farmer Osborn was on his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75 producers in the basin , in another year more than 150.
