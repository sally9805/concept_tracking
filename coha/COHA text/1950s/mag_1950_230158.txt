The Cocktail Party ( by T. S. Eliot ; produced by Gilbert Miller ) is not a complete success as a play . But it is a major event in the theater . Not only is most of it a very remarkable piece of writing , but it is of a different order and it operates at a different level from any new play that Broadway has offered in years . <P> It is a long , religious , didactic play , in verse . Yet it has the character of a psychological study , of drawing-room comedy , of domestic drama . It begins significantly with a cocktail party , emblem of all that is frivolous , ephemeral and heterogeneous in modern life . Characteristically , one guest is a stranger even to the host . The hostess is absent-called , her husband explains , to the sickbed of an aunt . <P> Actually , Lavinia Chamberlayne has left her husband . After five years of marriage she and Edward ( Eileen Peel and Robert Flemyng ) are neither happy nor faithful . Yet when the unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad ; and though he has had a much sounder relation with Celia Coplestone ( Irene Worth ) , he now does n't want her . When Lavinia does come back , she and Edward neurotically taunt each other . <P> They go for advice to a Harley Street specialist , who turns out to be the stranger at the cocktail party . They both lay their cards on the table face down . The specialist admonishes them for dramatizing themselves and trying to glorify their plight ; they are , he says , mere self-deceivers . Actually Edward , who can love nobody , and Lavinia , whom nobody can love , share a common bond of isolation , and will be far happier together than apart . Celia Coplestone comes to the specialist , too , but with a sense of sin and a capacity for humility and atonement : for her , salvation , no matter how arduous , will be necessary . The play ends two years later with another cocktail party , showing the Chamberlaynes adjusted and telling of Celia 's death by crucifixion while working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern world has still the look of a wasteland where drinks and tidbits are served . But his own stony The Waste Land lies now a long way off , for he himself has seen a hopeful way out . His Harley Street specialist is preaching Christian faith as well as Freud , concerned with love as well as sex ; and is indeed more spiritual adviser than psychiatrist . After his perplexed visitors have left , he and his assistants drink a libation of red wine-in telling contrast to a frivolous champagne toasting at the cocktail party-and chant for Celia : <P> <P> Watch over her in the desert Watch over her in the mountain Watch over her in the labyrinth Watch over her by the quicksand . <P> <P> Up to this peak point of the play , The Cocktail Party , however didactic , is exceedingly effective . The final scene , however , badly overlengthens and considerably flattens and weakens the play ; robs it , for all its substance , of the right , full-bodied effect .
