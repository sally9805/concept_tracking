This report on Britain 's election was cabled by TIME Correspondent Andre Laguerre : <P> <P> WINSTON LEONARD SPENCER CHURCHILL is fond of his collection of goldfish . When he approaches their pools in the lovely grounds of his country house at Chartwell Manor in Kent , the goldfish dart eagerly toward him . Churchill , wearing his familiar siren suit , an overcoat of a peculiarly bilious pea green draped over his shoulders , was feeding them one afternoon this week . One hand held the inevitable black cigar , and the other dipped into the tin of fish food proffered by his bodyguard . <P> " I wo n't be doing this much longer , " he observed . " In a week or two they will go to the bottom of the pool to hibernate . Just as well , perhaps . I might be too busy . " Whether he will be busy as Prime Minister or again as leader <P> of His Majesty 's Opposition in the House of Commons about to be elected was , of course , a question vitally preoccupying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I arrived at Chartwell I was greeted with a quick-fire question : " What is your idea about it all ? Now , do n't say something to please me . " <P> " Well , sir , I think it would be a good thing for most people if you won this election . " <P> Gruffly , Churchill shot back : " It will be a very hard thing for people if I win , I can promise you that . They will all have to do very much more . " <P> Churchill , in the words of a friend , " wants sweat and tears , in order to avoid the blood-and so that when we think of Great Britain we do n't have to visualize the first word in inverted commas . " <P> To a nation economically overextended , vitiated by controls and egalitarianism , puzzled and upset by loss of prestige overseas , and in the main jealously attached to the social gains made by her poorer classes since the war , Winston Churchill this week broadcast a jesting reminder : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diary . " <P> About four registered electors in five will remember , and vote . The betting in London is a little under 2 to 1 that they will return the Tories to office . The present Labor majority is so razor-thin that a small swing would bring Churchill back . Labor holds 54 seats by fewer than 3,000 votes . No landslide is needed merely a consistent trickle-to give the Tories a majority of 40 or 50 seats , which they regard as the minimum with which they could work for five years . <P> The Tories have a better prospect of winning this election than they had in 1945 or 1950 . But they are not improving their chances with a campaign which is being less smartly conducted than Labor 's . <P> The Iranian issue , which the Tories have ridden hard , is not quite as advantageous for the Tories as it ought to be . Churchill is justified in saying that Labor 's Foreign Secretary Herbert Morrison does not have the right to put the question , " Well , would you have gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Churchill had been in office the situation would not have arisen . But the fact remains that Morrison does ask the question , and so do Socialists all over the country .
