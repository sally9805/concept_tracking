THE budget deficit for fiscal 1953 , ending this month , will be about $7.9 billion , instead of the $5.9 billion estimated by Harry Truman . Chief reason : income from corporate taxes was less than Fair Deal estimates . <P> <P> INTERIOR Secretary McKay , worried over charges that he opposes the development of natural resources , will soon announce support for two gigantic power and irrigation projects for the West . One is the Frying Pan-Arkansas project to transport water eastward from Frying Pan Creek , a tributary of the Colorado , through a tunnel under the Continental Divide to the Arkansas River , south of Denver . The other is the Upper Colorado project , calling for the building of ten dams , which could rival lower Colorado 's Hoover ( Boulder ) Dam project , distribute water and power to Colorado , Wyoming , Utah , Idaho and New Mexico . McKay hopes Congress will authorize construction of the two projects for 1954 to 1955 , as a hedge against a business downturn . Total cost : $2.5 billion . <P> <P> LIFE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government 's higher-interest policies . Mutual companies ( e.g. , Phoenix , Massachusetts , Prudential ) which have been increasing dividends to policyholders on the basis of lower mortality rates have a new reason to continue the trend : they are earning more on investments . <P> <P> BECAUSE of a widening trade gap with the rest of the world , Turks fear the lira may be devalued . The government had hoped the gap would be filled by bigger wheat exports , but price-supported Turkish wheat is too expensive for the world market . In Istanbul 's black market , the lira , officially pegged at 2.82 to the dollar , was down to 5.50 last week . <P> <P> RFC 's new boss , Kenton R. Cravens , whose agency will probably be replaced next year by a bureau making loans to small businesses only , is running things as if RFC were already going out of business . He has fired 477 staffers , laid down a rigid stipulation that a defense contractor can get an RFC loan only with a certificate that the Government has first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loan . Result : loans have dwindled from ten or 15 a week to one or two . <P> <P> SOAPMAKERS are working themselves into a new competitive lather . Their latest product : all-detergent soap bars . Procter &; Gamble 's " Zest " is already being test-marketed , as is Colgate 's " Charmis " ; Lever Bros , is reported to be rushing a detergent bar of its own into production . The big ad froth will come next year . <P> <P> CI.O. executives , feeling that they are being ignored by the Administration , largely because the White House has failed to approve the Textile Workers ' John Edelman as an Assistant Secretary of Labor , have appropriated $1,000,000 for a radio &; TV program to attack President Eisenhower . Said one C.I.O. leader : " I move we tell the Administration to go to hell . " <P> <P> COMMERCE Secretary Weeks will take a long look at shipbuilding subsidies in hopes of getting the Government out of the shipping business . He cut $118,500,000 in subsidies to build new ships from his 1954 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Grace lines , which between them planned to build four ships this year , have canceled their plans . <P>
