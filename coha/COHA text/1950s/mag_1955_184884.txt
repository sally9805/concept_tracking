Israel struck oil last week , right on the fringe of the Negeb desert and only six miles from the Gaza strip . Rushing to the spot from Tel Aviv , Premier Designate David Ben-Gurion clambered down into a pit and dug to watch the first flow of the stuff . " Mazel Tov Congratulations , " he murmured to the drillers . " When can we start to use the stuff ? " Development Minister Dov Joseph hurried off by car to the Weizmann Institute of Science 25 miles away with a pop-bottleful to be assayed . <P> The finding : better than average quality , the same type as in Iraq 's big fields . When the drill casings were pulled off , the gusher spurted 60 feet into the air . The whole nation rejoiced over the discovery . Israelis hugged each other in city streets . <P> Newspapers sold out extras in minutes . <P> Farmers traveled to the scene of the strike from nearby desert settlements just to dip their hands into the oil spreading out over the reddish earth .

The company spudded in , ironically , almost precisely where the British-owned Iraq Petroleum Co. abandoned a test drilling in 1947 after going down 3,500 ft . The strike promised a major oil field , sufficient at least to save Israel $50 million* in oil imports a year , weaken the Arab states ' blockade and diminish the country 's dependence on the West . For the first time since their state was established , Israelis now saw the means to economic independence in their grasp . This produced an almost immediate stiffening of political independence as well . <P> " Now that oil has been found in the Negeb , we will never leave , " said one Israeli . At any rate , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Secretary of State Dulles ' effort to persuade Israel to cede some of the desert to the Arabs in return for a peace treaty . <P> <P> * A bill presently paid for Israel by the West German government as part of the reparations to atone for the Nazis ' savagery toward the Jews .
