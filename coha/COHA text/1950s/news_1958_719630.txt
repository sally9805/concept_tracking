txt There was a glimmer of hope last week that New York City 's municipal colleges might receive more state aid . The possibility of action at this session of the Legislature in Albany , however , is small . An earlier attempt by Governor Harriman to provide $6,000,000 a year assistance to the colleges was deleted from the budget . But one of the most important state aid measures did receive new support from a group of six Republican Senators from New York . This so-called Mitchell bill provides that the State pay onefourth of the operating costs of the four-year colleges . It contains , however , an all - important clause that would oblige the city colleges to accept out-of-city students , a practice they do not now follow . All students from beyond the city limits would have to pay tuition similar to what they would pay if they attended a state college . For example , Harpur College at Endicott , the only liberal arts college of the State University of New York , charges $400 for state students and $480 for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not pay a tuition . The only out-of-city students are those in the teacher-training programs and ? they are subsidized by the state to the amount of *7,420,789 . This is the only state aid now received by the colleges . Perennial Squabble The controversy over state aid is a perennial squabble over whether state funds for higher education should be reserved for the State University and its forty-two component parts or should be shared with the municipal colleges . Proponents of the proposition that state aid should be kept above the Bronx line hold that New York City is wealthy enough to take care of its own colleges while the State University requires every available dollar to expand its own facilities . On the other side it is argued that the state has an obligation to provide higher education for everyone who seeks it and that New York City should not be obligated to shoulder a disproportionate share of the cost because it has its own colleges . Dr. James E. Allen Jr. , State Commissioner of Education , said that , while the bill in the legislature does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it makes a start toward providing financial assistance . " There is no question , " he said , " but that the state can not fulfill its responsibility for extending opportunities in higher education without providing appropriate financial assistance to the city colleges and clarifying the relationship of the city college system to the State University . " 6Iore Applications Dr. Gustave G. Rosenberg , chairman of the Board of Higher Education , noted recently that in the fall of 1957 there were 16,688 highschool students making application for admission to the day sessions of the four colleges . Only 6,004 were admitted . " In the last five years , " he said , " there has been a 60 per cent increase in applicants to the four-year municipal colleges . For lack of facilities and teachers the enrollments rose only by 10 per cent . " Dr. Rosenberg estimated that due to the movement of families to suburban communities there are now some 100,000 residents of Westchester , Nassau and Suffolk counties who received their education at the municipal colleges . " We are mandated under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish college education to qualified young people in this city . It could be seriously questioned whether we are complying with this mandate by barring so many qualified students . " The mandate referred to by Dr. Rosenberg is contained in the State Education Law of 1926 when the Board . of Higher Education was created as an entity . It states that the board " shall furnish the benefits of higher education to those who are actual residents of the city and who are qualified for admission to any undergraduate course of study . " State Mandate This is an extension of the original law of 1847 , sponsored by Townsend Harris , President of the Board of Education , that established free education in the city . The State University has its own approach to free education . Most of its units do not charge tuition , although there is a variety of fees . Tuition is charged at the medical schools , the liberal arts college and for the science and engineering program at Stony Brook , L. I. The costs to students range from about $20 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two-year community colleges charge $100 to $125 a semester . It is felt that If the Mitchell Bill were passed the municipal colleges would receive better than $6,000,000 a year plus the $7,000,000 now received for teacher training , and in addition there would be the out-ofcity tuition fees . An indication of the cost of running the colleges can be seen in the most recent city system financial statement , which includes the operating costs of the two-year Staten Island and Bronx Community col-1 leges . The 1956-57 figure was $45 , - 933,973 , including capital costs . Of this amount $28,932,443 came from the City of New York . The State gave $7,420,789 and the Federal Government $296,775 . Student fees amounted to $5,081,664 and services $3,657,413 . Gifts and miscellaneous sources took care of the remainder of the costs . Enrollment and Value The latest estimate of the capital value of the four colleges , which have a student enrollment of over 80,000 , is $62,278,320 . The State University is a sprawling giant spread across the state . It has no central campus . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are twelve teachers colleges , fourteen two-year community colleges , six agricultural and technical institutes , seven professional colleges including veterinary and maritime units , and two medical colleges . The total enrollment for 1957-58 was reported as 35,000 students . There is no figure available comparable to that covering the operating costs of the municipal colleges but some idea of the cost may be derived from the 1956-57 budget figure of $59,145,697 . This however includes capital construction , income , Federal and loan assistance funds .
