As a middleweight Army boxer , Eddie Eagan won the championship of the Inter-Allied game sin 1919 . As an Olympic light-heavyweight he won the championship in 1920 . At Yale he was U.S. amateur heavyweight champion , and as a Rhodes scholar in 1924 Eagan won his boxing " blue " at Oxford , coached his teammate and pal " The Fighting Marquess " ( of Clydesdale ) , now Duke of Hamilton. * As a successful Manhattan lawyer and a lover of boxing , Eagan won another plum in 1945 : boxing commissioner of New York State . <P> But last week Eddie Eagan finally took a count of ten . He resigned his job , and the ink was barely dry before Governor Dewey appointed his successor : Hotelman Robert Christenberry , 52 , whose favorite indoor sport is watching wrestling matches on television . <P> The shift came at a time when boxing 's reputation was at its most unsavory low ; in the past 19 months three boxers have died of injuries suffered in New York rings . The International Boxing Club , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in most big U.S. cities , was under heavy fire for its habit of refusing fights to boxers who do not sign an exclusive contract with I.B.C. And Congress was getting ready for a full investigation of I.B.C. 's monopoly . <P> No one would put the full blame for boxing 's sorry state on ex-Commissioner Eagan .

He is profoundly honest and profoundly sincere , diffident , humble and considerate . The first two qualities are indispensable in a boxing commissioner ; probably the other three are a handicap . " Smith also had a warning for Christenberry : " This veteran hotelman will find the fight mob noisier than convention drunks , less manageable than a weekend football crowd , and accomplished in more devious dodges than an absconding deadbeat . " <P> Last week , less than 48 hours after he had taken office , Christenberry got a fine example of just what Columnist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandy Saddler and Willie Pep . After nine rounds of butting , thumbing , gouging-and one wild wrestling spree which brought the referee down in a free-for-all tangle-Pep sullenly threw in the towel . <P> Boxing Commissioner Christenberry demanded a full report from the principals , the referee and the judges . It looked as though Wrestling Fan Christenberry might have to give boxing 's dirty linen a much-needed airing . <P> <P> - Eagan 's companion in a round-the-world tour , during which they fought the best amateurs in the British Empire .
