Yale 's burly ( 6 ft. 1 in. , 215 Ibs. ) , black-haired Jim Fuchs has broken world or meet records in every outing this spring . Last week , in his graduation performance in the I.C.4-A. - track &; field meet at New York City 's Randalls Island , he had something of an off day . He did not break the world record again ; he merely broke his own meet record by more than a foot ( in a qualifying toss ) , placed second in the discus and led Yale to the team title over 46 competing colleges . <P> As theatrical as he is efficient , Fuchs spits on his gold-colored , 16-lb. shot and thoughtfully polishes it with a massive paw before he gets poised for his throw . Then , with a negative , jowl-flapping shudder of his head , he crouches slightly on his powerful legs ( " they 're 50% of my success " ) and uncoils his frame from his toes to his fingertips . His heave last week was 57 ft. 9 in. , 8 in. short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Said Fuchs after the effort : " Sooner or later someone will throw it 60 feet . I hope I 'm the one . " His post-graduation plans now that he has his degree in sight ( A.B. , Sociology major ) include competition for the New York Athletic Club , then a shot at the 1952 Olympics . Said perfectionist Shot-putter Fuchs , rubbing a tender index finger : " If I were satisfied now , I 'd never get any better .
