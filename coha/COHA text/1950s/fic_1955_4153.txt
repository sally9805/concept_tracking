Illustration THE GUARDIANS BY IRVING COX , JR . It 's not always " The Truth shall set you free ! " Sometimes it 's " Want of the Truth shall drive you to escape ! " And that can be dangerous ! Illustrated by van Dongen Mryna Brill intended to ride the god-car above the rain mist . For a long time she had not believed in the taboos or the Earth-god . She no longer believed she lived on Earth . This paradise of green-floored forests and running brooks was something called Rythar . Six years ago , when Mryna was fourteen , she first discovered the truth . She asked a question and the Earth-god ignored it . A simple question , really : What is above the rain mist ? God could have told her . Every day he answered technical questions that were far more difficult . Instead , he repeated the familiar taboo about avoiding the Old Village because of the Sickness . And consequently Mryna , being female , went to the Old Village . There was nothing really unusual about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time . They had worked out a sort of charm that made it all right . They ran past the burned out shells of the old houses and they kept their eyes shaded to ward off the Sickness . But even at fourteen Mryna had outgrown charms and she did n't believe in the Sickness . She had once asked the Earth-god what sickness meant , and the screen in the answer house had given her a very detailed answer . Mryna knew that none of the hundred girls and thirty boys inhabiting Rythar had ever been sick . That , like the taboo of the Old Village , she considered a childish superstition . The Old Village was n't large  --  three parallel roads , a mile long , lined with the charred ruins of prefabs , which were exactly like the cottages where the kids lived . It was nothing to inspire either fear or legend . The village had burned a long time ago ; the grass from the forest had grown a green mantle over the skeletal walls . For weeks Mryna poked through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scorched pages of a printed pamphlet buried deep in the black earth . The paper excited her tremendously . It was different from the film books photographed in the answer house . She had never touched anything like it ; and it seemed wonderful stuff . She read the pamphlet eagerly . It was part of a promotional advertisement of a world called Rythar , " the jewel of the Sirian Solar System . " The description made it obvious that Rythar was the green paradise where Mryna lived  --  the place she had been taught to call Earth . And the pamphlet had been addressed to " Earthmen everywhere . " Mryna made her second find when she was fifteen , a textbook in astronomy . For the first time in her life she read about the spinning dust of the universe lying beyond the eternal rain mist that hid her world . The solid , stable Earth of her childhood was solid and stable no longer , but a sphere turning through a black void . Nor was it properly called Earth , but a planet named Rythar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lost faith in everything she believed . Yet the clock-work logic of astronomy appealed to her orderly mind . It explained why the rain mist glowed with light during the day and turned dark at night . Mryna had never seen a clear sky . She had no visual data to tie her new concept to . For six years she kept the secret . She hid the papers and the astronomy text which she found in the Old Village . Later , after the metal men came , she destroyed everything so none of the other women would know the Earth-god was a man . At first she kept the secret because she was afraid . For some reason the man who played at being god wanted the kids to believe Rythar was Earth , the totality of the universe enveloped in a cloud of mist . She knew that because she once asked god what a planet was . The face on the screen in the answer house became frigid with anger  --  or was it fear ?  --  and the Earth-god said : " The word means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god-car brought six metal men down through the rain mist . They were huge , jointed things that clanked when they walked . Four of them used weapons to herd the kids together in their small settlement . The two others went to the Old Village and blasted the ruins with high explosives . Vaguely Mryna remembered that the metal men had been there before , when the kids were still very small . They had built the new settlement and they had brought food . They lived with the children for a long time , she thought  --  but the memory was hazy . As the years passed , Mryna 's fear retreated and only one thing became important : she knew the Earth-god was a man . On the fertile soil of Rythar there were one hundred women and thirty men . All the boys had taken mates before they reached seventeen . Seventy girls were left unmarried , with no prospect of ever having husbands . A score or more became second wives in polygamous homes , but plural marriage had no appeal for Mryna . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And why should n't it be the Earth-god ? As her first step toward escape , Mryna volunteered for duty in the answer house . For as long as she could remember , the answer house had stood on a knoll some distance beyond the new settlement . It was a square , one-room building , housing a speaking box , a glass screen and a console of transmission machinery . Anyone in the settlement could contact god and request information or special equipment . God went out of his way to deluge them with information . The simplest question produced voluminous data , transmitted over the screen and photographed on reels of film . Someone had to be in the answer house to handle the photography . The work was not hard , but it was monotonous . Most of the kids preferred to farm the fields or dig the sacrificial ore . A request for equipment was granted just as promptly . Tools , machines , seeds , fertilizers , packaged buildings , games , clothing  --  everything came in a god-car . It was a large cylinder which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . The landing site was a flat , charred field near the answer house . Unless the equipment was unusually heavy , the attendant stationed in the house was expected to unload the god-car and pile aboard the sacrifice ores mined on Rythar . God asked two things from the settlement : the pieces of unusually heavy metal which they dug from the hills , and tiny vials of soil . In an hour 's time they could mine enough ore to fill the compartment of a god-car , and god never complained if they sometimes sent the cylinder back empty . But he fussed mightily over the small vials of Earth . He gave very explicit directions as to where they were to take the samples , and the place was never the same . Sometimes they had to travel miles from the settlement to satisfy that inexplicable whim . For two weeks Mryna patiently ran off the endless films of new books and unloaded the god-car when it came . She examined the interior of the cylinder carefully and she weighed every possible risk . The compartment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe . And so she made her decision . Tense and tight-lipped Mryna Brill slipped aboard the god-car . She sealed the lock door , which automatically fired the launching tubes . After that there was no turning back . The dark compartment shook in a thunder of sound . The weight of the escape speed tore at her body , pulling her tight against the confining walls . She lost consciousness until the pressure lessened . The metal walls became hot but the space was too confining for her to avoid contact entirely . Four narrow light tubes came on , with a dull , red glow , and suddenly a gelatinous liquid emptied out of ceiling vents . The fluid sprayed every exposed surface in the cubicle , draining through the shipment of sacrifice ores at Mryna 's feet . It had a choking , antiseptic odor ; it stung Mryna 's face and inflamed her eyes . Worse still , as the liquid soaked into her clothing , it disintegrated the fiber , tearing away the cloth in long strips which slowly dissolved in the liquid on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helplessly naked . Even her black boots had not survived . The red lights went out and Mryna was imprisoned again in the crushing darkness . A terror of the taboos she had defied swept her mind . She began to scream , but the sound was lost in the roar of the motors . Suddenly it was over . The god-car lurched into something hard . Mryna was thrown against the ceiling  --  and she hung there , weightless . The pieces of sacrifice ore were floating in the darkness just as she was . The motors cut out and the lock door swung open . Mryna saw a circular room , brightly lighted with a glaring , blue light . The nature of her fear changed . This was the house of the Earth-god , but she could not let him find her naked . She tried to run into the circular room . She found that the slightest exertion of her muscles sent her spinning through the air . She could not get her feet on the floor . There was no down and no up in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she snatched at a light bracket to keep herself from bouncing free in the empty air again . The god-car had landed against what was either the ceiling or the floor of the circular room . Mryna had no way of making a differentiation . Eight brightly lighted corridors opened into the side walls . Mryna heard footsteps moving toward her down one of the corridors ; she pulled herself blindly into another . As she went farther from the circular room , a vague sense of gravity returned . At the end of the corridor she was able to stand on her feet again , although she still had to walk very carefully . Any sudden movement sent her soaring in a graceful leap that banged her head against the ceiling . Cautiously she opened a thick , metal door into another hall  --  and she stood transfixed , looking through a mica wall at the emptiness of space pinpointed with its billions of stars . This was the reality of the charts she had seen in the astronomy text : that knowledge alone saved her sanity . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist ; she must believe it now . From where she stood , she was able to see the place where the god-car had brought her  --  like a vast cartwheel spinning in the void . The god-car was clamped against the hub , from which eight corridors radiated outward like wheel spokes toward the rim . Far below the gigantic wheel Mryna saw the sphere of Rythar , invisible behind its shroud of glowing mist . She moved along the rim corridor , past the mica wall , until she came to a door that stood open . The room beyond was a sleeping compartment and it was empty . She searched it for clothing , and found nothing . She went through four more dormitory rooms before she came upon anything she could use  --  brief shorts , clearly made for a man , and a loose , white tunic . It was n't suitable ; it was n't the way she wanted to be dressed when she faced him . But it had to do . Mryna was pawing through a footlocker looking for boots when she heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small , stooped , white-haired man , naked except for trunks like the ones she was wearing . The wrinkled skin on his wasted chest was burned brown by the hot glare of the sun . Thick-lensed glasses hung from a chain around his neck . " My dear young lady , " he said in a tired voice , " this is a men 's ward ! " " I 'm sorry . I did n't know  --  " " You must be a new patient . " He fumbled for his glasses . Instinctively she knew she should n't let him see her clearly enough to identify her as a stranger . She shoved past him , knocking the glasses from his hand . " I 'd better find my own  --  ward . " Mryna did n't know the word , but she supposed it meant some sort of sleeping chamber . The old man said chattily , " I had n't heard they were bringing in any new patients today . " She was in the corridor by that time . He reached for her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was a timid , hopeful question . " And you 'll tell me all the news  --  everything they 're doing back on Earth . I have n't been home for almost a year . " She fled down the hall . When she heard voices ahead of her , she pulled back a door and slid into another room  --  a storeroom piled with cases of medicines . Behind the cartons she thought she would be safe . This was n't what she had expected . Mryna thought there might be one man living in a kind of prefab somehow suspended above the rain mist . But there were obviously others up here ; she did n't know how many . And the old man frightened her  --  more than the dazzling sight of the heavens visible through the mica wall . Mryna had never seen physical age before . No one on Rythar was older than she was herself  --  a sturdy , healthy , lusty twenty . The old man 's infirmity disgusted her ; for the first time in her life she was conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply room slid open . Mryna crouched low behind the cartons , but she was able to see the man and the woman who had entered the room . A woman  --  here ? Mryna had n't considered that possibility . Perhaps the Earth-god already had a mate . The newcomers were dressed in crisp , white uniforms ; the woman wore a starched , white hat . They carried a tray of small , glass cylinders from which metal needles projected . While the woman held the tray , the man drove the needles through the caps of small bottles and filled the cylinders with a bright-colored liquid . " When are you leaving , Dick ? " the woman asked . " In about forty minutes . They 're sending an auto-pickup . " " Oh , no ! " " Now do n't start worrying . They have got the bugs out of it by this time . The auto-pickups are entirely trustworthy . " " Sure , that 's what the army says . " " In theory they should be even more reliable than  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And miss the chance to address Congress this year ? We 've worked too long for this ; I do n't want to muff it now . We 've all the statistical proof we need , even to convince those pinchpenny halfwits . During the past eight years we 've handled more than a thousand cases up here . On Earth they were pronounced incurable ; we 've sent better than eighty per cent back in good health after an average stay of fourteen months . " " No medical man has ever questioned the efficiency of cosmic radiation and a reduced atmospheric gravity , Dick . " " It 's just our so-called statesmen , always yapping about the budget . But this time we have the cost problem licked , too . For a year and a half the ore they send up from Rythar has paid for our entire operation . " " I did n't know that . " " We 've kept it under wraps , so the politicians would n't cut our appropriations . " Their glass tubes were full , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " the woman persisted You 're our assistant medical director and  --  " Her words were cut off as the door slid shut behind them . Mryna tried to fit this new information into what she already knew  --  or thought she knew  --  about the Earth-god . It did n't add up to a pretty picture . She had once asked for a definition of illness , and it was apparent to her that this place which they called the Guardian Wheel was an expensive hospital for Earthmen . It was paid for by the sacrificial ores mined on Rythar . In a sense , Rythar was being enslaved and exploited by Earth . True , it was not difficult to dig out the ore , but Mryna resented the fact that the kids on Rythar had not been told the truth . She had long ago lost her awe of the man called god ; now she lost her respect as well . Mryna was glad she had not seen him , glad no one knew she was aboard the Guardian Wheel . She would return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rythar would send up no more sacrifice ores . Let the Earthmen come down and mine it for themselves ! Very cautiously she pulled the door open . The rim corridor was empty . She moved toward one of the intersecting corridors . When she heard footsteps , she hid in another dormitory room . This was different from the others . It showed more evidence of permanent occupation . She guessed it was a dormitory for the people who took care of the sick . Pictures were fastened to the curved , metal walls . Personal articles cluttered the shelves hung beside the bunks . On a writing desk she saw a number of typed reports . Five freshly laundered uniforms , identical to the one she had lost in the antiseptic wash , hung on a rack behind the door . Mryna stripped off the makeshift she was wearing and put on one of the uniforms ; she found boots under the desk . When she was dressed , she stood admiring herself in the polished surface of the metal door . She was a handsome woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tanned by the mist-filtered sunlight of Rythar ; her lips were red and sensuous ; her long , platinum-colored hair fell to her shoulders . She compared herself to the small , hard-faced female she had seen in the supply room . Was that a typical Earthwoman ? Mryna 's lips curled in a scornful smile . Let the gods come down to Rythar , then , and discover what a real female was like in the lush , green , Rytharian paradise . Mryna went to the desk and glanced at the typed reports . They had been written by a man who signed himself " Commander in Charge , Guardian Wheel , " and they were addressed to the Congress of the world government . One typed document was a supply inventory ; a second , still unfinished , was a budget report . ( You wo n't show a profit next time , Mryna thought vindictively , when we stop sending you the sacrifice ore . ) Another report dealt with Rythar , and Mryna read it with more interest . One paragraph caught her attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an area covering ten thousand square miles . Our chemical analysis has been thorough , and we find nothing that could be remotely harmful to human life . Atmospheric samples produce the same negative results . On the other hand , we have direct evidence that no animal life has ever evolved on Rythar ; the life cycle is exclusively botanical . " The soil samples , Mryna realized , would be the vials of Earth which the Earth-god had requested so often . Were the Earthmen planning to move their hospital down to Rythar ? That idea disturbed her . Mryna did not want her garden world cluttered up with a lot of sick , old men discarded by Earth . She turned to the second page of the report . " The original colony survived for a year . The Sickness in the Old Village developed only after the first harvest of Rytharian-grown food . It is more and more evident that the botanical cycle of Rythar must be examined before we find the answer . To do that adequately , we shall have to send survey teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research than we have had in the past . The metal immunization suits , which must , of course , be destroyed after each expedition  --  " " And what , may I ask , is the meaning of this ? " Mryna dropped the report and swung toward the door . She saw a woman standing there  --  another hard-faced Earthwoman , with a starched , white cap perched on her graying hair . " I must have come to the wrong room , " Mryna said in a small voice . " Indeed ! Everyone knows this is command headquarters . Who are you ? " The woman put her hand on Mryna 's arm , and the fingers bit through the uniform into Mryna 's flesh . Mryna pulled away , drawing her shoulders back proudly . Why should she feel afraid ? She stood a head taller than this dried up stranger ; she knew the Earthwoman 's strength would be no match for hers . " My name is Mryna Brill , " she said quietly . " I came up in a god-car from Rythar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell open . She whispered the word as if it were profanity . Suddenly she turned and ran down the rim corridor , screaming in terror . She 's afraid of me ! Mryna thought . And that made no sense at all . Mryna knew she had to get back to the god-car quickly . Since the Earthmen had built up the taboos in order to get their sacrifice ores from Rythar , they would do everything they could to prevent her return . She ran toward an intersecting spoke corridor . An alarm bell began to clang , and the sound vibrated against the metal walls . An armed man sprang from a side room and fired his weapon at Mryna . The discharge burned a deep groove in the wall . So they would even kill her  --  these men who pretended to be gods ! Before the man could fire again , Mryna swung down a side corridor , and at once the sensation of weightlessness overtook her . She could not move quickly . She saw the armed man at the mouth of the corridor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was crowded with consoles of transmission machines . Three men were seated in front of the speakers . They jumped and came toward her , clumsily fighting the weightlessness . Mryna caught at the door jamb and swung herself toward the ceiling . At the same time the armed man fired . The discharge missed her and washed against the transmission machinery . Blue fire exploded from the room . The three men screamed in agony . Concussion threw Mryna helplessly toward the rim again . And the Guardian Wheel was plunged into darkness . Mryna 's head swam ; her shoulder seethed with pain where she had banged into the wall . She tried to creep toward the circular room , but she had lost her sense of direction and she found herself back on the rim . The clanging bell had stopped when the lights went out , but Mryna heard the panic of frightened voices . Far away someone was screaming . Running feet clattered toward her . Mryna flattened herself against the outer wall . An indistinct body of men shot past her . " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A woman from Rythar ! " " And we 've blasted the communication center . We 've no way of sending the warning back to Earth  --  " They were gone . Mryna moved back into the spoke corridor . She felt her way silently toward the circular hub room and the god-car . Suddenly very close she heard voices which she recognized  --  the man and the woman who had been talking in the supply room . " You 're still all right , Dick , " the woman said . " She has n't been here long enough to  --  " " We do n't know that . We do n't know how it spreads or how quickly . We ca n't take the chance . " " Then ... then we 've no choice ? " Her voice was a small whisper , choked with terror . " None . These have been standing emergency orders for twenty years . We always faced the possibility that one of them would escape . If we 'd been allowed to use a different policy of education  --  but the politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed , and we must die with it . " " Could n't we wait and make sure ? " " It works too fast . None of us would be able to do the job  --  afterward . " The voices moved away . Mryna floated toward the hub room . She found the air lock and pulled herself into the god-car . The metal lock hissed closed and light came on . Then she knew she had made a mistake . This ship was not the one she had used when she came up from Rythar . The tiny cabin was fitted with a sleeping lounge , a food cabinet and a file of reading films . Above the lounge a mica viewplate gave her a broad view of the sky . Mryna remembered that the man in the supply room had said he was waiting for an auto-pickup ; he was on his way back to Earth . Mryna had taken his ship instead of her own . In panic she tried to open the door again , but she found no way to do it . Machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight lurch as the pickup left the hub of the Guardian Wheel . It swung in a wide arc . Through the viewplate she saw the enormous Wheel growing small behind her , silhouetted against the mist of Rythar . Suddenly the wheel glowed red with a soundless explosion . Its flaming fragments died in the void . Mryna dropped weakly on the lounge . Nausea spun through her mind . The man had said they would destroy themselves . Because Mryna had come aboard ? But why were they afraid of her ? What possible harm could she do them ? Mryna had left Rythar to discover the truth , and the truth was insanity . Was truth always like this  --  a bitter disillusionment , an empty horror ? She had something else to say to the people of Rythar now : not that the gods were men , but that men were mad . Believe in the taboos ; send up the sacrificial ores . It was a small price to pay to keep that madness away from Rythar . And Mryna knew she could not go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rythar ; the auto-pickup was carrying her inexorably toward Earth . The scream of the machinery slowly turned shrill , hammering against her eardrums . The stars visible in the viewplate blurred and winked out . Mryna felt a twist of vertigo as the shuttle shifted from conventional speed into a time warp . And then the sound was gone . The ship was floating in an impenetrable blackness . Mryna had no idea how much time passed subjectively . When she became hungry , she took food from the cabinet . She slept when she was tired . To pass the time , she turned the reading films through the projector . Most of the film stored in the shuttle covered material Mryna already knew . The Earthmen , clearly , had not denied any information to Rythar . Only one thing had been restricted  --  astronomy . And that would have made no difference , if Mryna had not found the text in the ruins of the Old Village . The people on Rythar never saw the stars ; they had no way of knowing  --  or caring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more interested in the history of Earth , which she had never known before . She studied the pictures of the great industrial centers and the crowded countryside . She was awed by the mobs in the city streets and the towering buildings . Yet she liked her own world more  --  the forests and the clear-running brooks ; the vast , uncrowded , open spaces . It puzzled her that the people of Earth would give the Rytharian paradise to a handful of children , when their own world was so overcrowded . Was this another form of the madness that had driven the people in the Wheel to destroy themselves ? That made a convenient explanation , yet Mryna 's mind was too logical to accept it . One film referred to the founding of the original colony on Rythar , a planet in the Sirian System which had been named for its discoverer . Rythar , according to the film , was one of a score of colonies established by Earth . It was unbelievably rich in deposits of uranium . That , Mryna surmised , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god-cars . The atmosphere and gravity of Rythar duplicated that of Earth ; Rythar should have become the largest colony in the system . The government of Earth had originally planned a migration of ten million persons . " But after twelve months the survey colony was destroyed by an infection , " Mryna read on the projection screen , " which has never been identified . It is called simply the Sickness . The origin of this plague is unknown . No adult in the survey colony survived ; children born on Rythar are themselves immune , but are carriers of the Sickness . The first rescue team sent to save them died within eight hours . No human being , aside from these native-born children , has ever survived the Sickness . " Now Mryna had the whole truth . She knew the motivation for their madness of self-destruction . It was not insanity , but the sublime courage of a few human beings sacrificing themselves to save the rest of their civilization . They smashed the Guardian Wheel to keep the Sickness there . And Mryna had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space toward Earth and she would destroy that , too . If she killed herself , that would in no way alter the situation . The ship would still move in its appointed course . Her body would be aboard ; perhaps the very furnishings in the cabin were now infected with the germ of the Sickness . When the ship touched Earth , the fatal poison would escape . Dully Mryna turned up another frame on the film , and she read what the Earthmen had done to help Rythar . They built the Guardian Wheel to isolate the Sickness . Sealed in metal immunization suits , volunteers had descended to the plague world and reared the surviving children of the colonists until they were old enough to look out for themselves . The answer house had been set up as an instructional device . " As nearly as possible , the scientists in charge attempted to create a normal social situation for the plague carriers . They could never be allowed to leave Rythar , but when they matured enough to know the truth , Rythar could be integrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant trade factor in the colonial market . An incidental by-product of the Guardian Wheel is the hospital facility , where advanced cases of certain cancers and lung diseases have been cured in a reduced gravity or by exposure to cosmic radiation . " Mryna shut off the projection . The words made sense , but the results did not . And she knew precisely why Earth had failed . When they matured  --  in those three words she had her answer . And now it did n't matter . There was nothing she could do . Her ship was a poisoned arrow aimed directly at the heart of man 's civilization . Mryna had slept twice when the auto-pickup lurched out of the time drive and she was able to see the stars again . Directly ahead of her she saw an emerald planet , bright in the sun . And she knew instinctively that it was Earth . A speaker under the viewport throbbed with the sound of a human voice . " Auto-shuttle SC 539 , attention . You are assigned landing slot seven-three-one , Port Chicago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you read me ? " Three times the message was repeated before Mryna concluded that it was meant for her . She found three small knobs close to the speaker and a plastic toggle labeled " voice reply . " She snapped it shut and found that she could speak to the Chicago spaceport . Her problem was easily solved , then . She could say she came from Rythar . Without hesitation , Earth ships would be sent to blast her ship out of the sky before she would be able to land . But she knew she had to accomplish more than that ; the same mistake must not be repeated again . " How much time do I have ? " she asked . " Thirty-four minutes . " " Can you keep this shuttle up here any longer than that ? " " Lady , the auto-pickups are on tape-pilot . Come hell or high water , they land exactly on schedule . " " What happens if I do n't dial the slot destination ? " " We bring you in on emergency  --  and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be allowed to speak to someone in authority in the government . The Chicago port manager told her the request was absurd . For nine minutes Mryna argued , with a mounting sense of urgency , before he gave his grudging consent . Her trouble was that she had to skate close to the truth without admitting it directly . She could not  --  except as a last resort  --  let them kill her until they knew why the isolation of Rythar had failed . It was thirteen minutes before landing when Mryna finally heard an older , more dignified voice on the speaker . By then the green globe of Earth filled the sky ; Mryna could make out the shapes of the continents turning below her . The older man identified himself as a senator elected to the planetary Congress . She did n't know how much authority he represented , but she could n't afford to wait any longer . She told him frankly who she was . She knew she was pronouncing her own death sentence , yet she spoke quietly . She must show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Guardian Wheel . " Listen to me for two minutes more before you blast my ship , " she asked . " I rode the god-car up from Rythar  --  I am coming now to spread the Sickness on Earth  --  because I wanted to know the truth about something that puzzled me . I had to know what was above the rain mist . In the answer house you would not tell us that . Now I understand why . We were children . You were waiting for us to mature . And that is the mistake you made ; that blindness nearly destroyed your civilization . " You will have to build another Guardian Wheel . This time do n't hide anything from us because we 're children . The truth makes us mature , not illusions or taboos . Never forget that . It is easier to face a fact than to have to give up a dream we 've been taught to believe . Tell your children the truth when they ask for it . Tell us , please . We can adjust to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mryna drew a long breath . Her lips were trembling . Did this man understand what she had tried to say ? She would never know . If she failed , Earth  --  in spite of its generosity and its courage  --  would one day be destroyed by children bred on too many delusions . " I 'm ready , " Mryna said steadily . " Send up your warships and destroy me . " She waited . Less than ten minutes were left . Her shuttle began to move more slowly . She was no more than a mile above Earth . She saw the soaring cities and the white highways twisting through green fields . Seven minutes left . Where were the warships ? She looked anxiously through the viewport and the sky was empty . Desperately she closed the voice toggle again . " Send them quickly ! " she cried . " You must not let me land ! " No reply came from the speaker . Her auto-shuttle began to circle a large city which lay at the southern tip of an inland lake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why do n't you do something ? " Mryna screamed . " What are you waiting for ? " The shuttle settled into a metal rack . The lock hissed open . Mryna shrank back against the wall , looking out at what she would destroy  --  what she had already destroyed . A dignified , portly man came panting up the ramp toward her . " No ! " she whispered . " Do n't come in here . " " I am Senator Brieson , " he said shortly . " For ten years Dr. Jameson has been telling us from the Guardian Wheel that we should adopt a different educational policy toward Rythar . Your scare broadcast was clever , but we 're used to Jameson 's tricks . He 'll be removed from office for this , and if I have anything to say about it  --  " " You did n't believe me ? " Mryna gasped . " Of course not . If a plague carrier escaped from Rythar , we would have heard about it long before this . The trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us any common sense . And Jameson 's the worst of the lot . He 's always contended that the sociologists should determine our Rytharian policy , not the elected representatives of the people .
