ARMED FORCES Training by Torture <P> Korea showed that captured U.S. servicemen could be forced by torture , by the threat of torture , and sometimes by the mere promise of creature comforts , to hurt their fellow prisoners and their country . This came as a shock to the U.S. public ; it came as even more of a shock to the nation 's military leaders , and it was inevitable that they should determine to do something about it . <P> Foremost in the attempt to train men to resist torture is the U.S. Air Force . At the Stead Air Force Base near Reno , nearly 30,000 airmen have gone through a course in which some of the ugliest Communist methods of handling prisoners are followed . Herded behind barbed wire for a 36-hour interrogation period , the " prisoners " are subjected to electrical shocks , crammed into an upright box where they can neither sit nor stand , forced to stand shoulder deep in water for hours of darkness , fed a mixture of raw spinach and uncooked spaghetti , made to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about their wives . <P> Last week , in reply to published charges that the Stead school is one of epic brutality , its top officers were summoned to Washington , where they met with Lieut . General Emmett ( " Rosie " ) O'Donnell Jr. , the Air Force deputy chief of personnel . The Steadmen , Colonel Burton E. McKenzie , school commander , and Major John Oliphant , training director , later reported that O'Donnell had commended them and that they contemplated no change in the school 's program . <P> " We never take a man and see how much he can stand , " said McKenzie , a German P.O.W. for 14 months in World War II . " We do not degrade students . We try to teach them by demonstration what to expect if captured , and how to conduct themselves to evade punishment . <P> " We feel our greatest accomplishment is to remove the pattern of fear of the unknown . . . " <P> Sometimes the unknown is less feared than the known , and there is grave doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Men can be given spiritual stamina through spiritual training ; they can achieve physical stamina through physical training . There is no evidence that they can become immune to torture by small doses of torture .
