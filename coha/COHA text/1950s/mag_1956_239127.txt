Lest anyone misunderstand the purpose of a lot of talking and traveling that he will be doing between now and Nov. 6 , Candidate Dwight Eisenhower took an opportunity to set the matter straight in his own plain language . Speaking last week before a crowd of 50,000 in Cleveland 's public square , he took one look at the accomplishments of his Administration , another at what remains to be done in Washington , and amiably confessed he " sincerely and devotedly " wants to " continue the job . " In order to do so , he needed something from his audience : " Your help . " <P> In addition to making his frankest re-election appeal to date , Ike used his Cleveland talk to rip into Adlai Stevenson . Without mentioning Stevenson by name , he struck at " politicians . . . who go about the country expressing . . . their worries about America and the American people , " suggested that such " worrywarts " should " forget themselves for a while " and " get out and mingle with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " their worries would begin to sound foolish-even to them . " Troubled with an ailing public-address system , Ike evoked only mild enthusiasm from his Cleveland audience . <P> Leaving his special campaign train to travel to Kentucky by air , Ike continued his attack that night from Lexington . Seventeen thousand University of Kentucky students and Lexington townspeople interrupted him time and time again with short , hard bursts of applause as he belted away at " the opposition . " Wherever and however he has served his country , he said , he has never found the choice between " going forward or going backward " difficult . Yet , in 1956 , " a lot of politicians " are doing their best to make such a choice look " extremely hard . " Then , scornfully , he wondered if such action could be attributed to " people who suffer from living in a world of words and phrases for so long that they can no longer recognize action when they see it . And when it comes to a really critical matter like political leadership , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our daily lives : the longest lectures almost always come from those with least experience . " <P> Ike 's final public appearance of the week was billed by the White House as " nonpolitical " ; as things turned out , he could hardly have appeared in a more favorable light than before the 34,479 jammed into Brooklyn 's Ebbets Field for the first game of the World Series . With baseball-wise enthusiasm Ike helped root the Dodgers home to a 6-3 victory over the New York Yankees . As he left the park , the friendly crowd reciprocated with roars of applause . <P> It was a satisfying political week for Candidate Eisenhower , a man who likes his job and frankly wants to keep it .
