If anyone wants to know how to milk rattlesnakes , or how they taste French-fried , or whether their rattle is a love call , the place to find the answers is a monstrous ( 1,500 pp. ) book called Rattlesnakes , published last week by Laurence M. Klauber ( University of California Press ; $17.50 ) . The book covers rattlesnakes from A ( Crotalus viridis abyssus ) to Z ( Crotalus zetazomae ) . <P> Milking rattlesnakes of their venom is relatively easy . During his 35 years as consulting curator of reptiles at the San Diego Zoo , Klauber milked 5,171 of them by opening their mouths with a metal claw , hooking their fangs over the edge of a cup and pressing out the contents of their poison glands . The venom , he says , is almost odorless . Its taste is first astringent , then turns sweetish . It makes the lips tingle a little . <P> Ethereal Delights . Rattlesnake venom , says Klauber , has , at various times , been considered a cure for epilepsy , bronchitis , pneumonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever , leprosy and elephantiasis . Pills made out of the poison glands ground up and mixed with cheese were once prescribed for palsy and typhus ; they also give a feeling of " ethereal delights . " Rattlesnake oil was once a popular remedy , too , but both venom and oil have now fallen out of medical favor . The chief modern use for the venom is to immunize horses so their serum can be used to cure rattlesnake bites . <P> Klauber tells how rattlesnakes hunt . Their eyes are pretty good , but in darkness they depend on the " pits " in the sides of their heads . These are true senses , responding to infra-red ( heat ) radiation like soldiers ' snooperscopes . In the darkest night or at the bottom of the darkest burrow , the snake can " see " a mouse or a squirrel by the warmth of its skin . <P> It can also smell its prey without breathing .

The animal runs a few feet or yards until the poison brings it down . Then the snake follows by scent , flicking its delicate tongue , and starts the slow business of swallowing the meal . The injected venom contains a substance that starts the digestive process before the animal reaches the snake 's stomach . <P> Male Dance . Baby rattlesnakes are born alive , hatching from eggs retained in the mother 's body . More vicious than the grownups , they strike with their tiny fangs at the slightest provocation . Mother rattlesnakes do not take care of their young . The rattle is a simple warning , not a love call , and males take only the briefest interest in the females . But male rattlesnakes have the odd custom of " wrestling " together , swaying their heads and bodies with a graceful rhythmic motion . The defeated snake is never bitten or otherwise hurt .
