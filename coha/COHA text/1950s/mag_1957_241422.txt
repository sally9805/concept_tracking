( See Cover ) <P> On a screened porch in the residence of the U.S. ambassador in green and summery Ottawa , two tall , greying men stood elbow to elbow one evening last week , each intent upon the other . While cocktail-party chatter echoed in other rooms , John George Diefenbaker , the Prime Minister of Canada , talked , gestured , sipped from a glass of orange juice . John Foster Dulles , the U.S. Secretary of State , cradled a rye highball in his hand as he nodded , smiled , listened . Thus casually , top officials of the world 's two most neighborly nations began to explore the subtle new relationship that must come about . Reason : Canada , in an upset election , has chosen a Tory government that is worried about the possibility of U.S. economic domination over Canada . <P> Prime Minister Diefenbaker , 61 , is a Saskatchewan lawyer who lost five elections before he finally reached Parliament at the age of 44 . An unknown who won leadership of the minority Tory Party last December mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honorably to inevitable defeat , he instead took the party to victory by an exhausting personal effort . He knows , likes and respects the U.S. But his brow darkens and he grows snappishly critical at even such a small economic friction as last month 's unloading of low-priced U.S. turkeys onto the Ontario market . Dulles ' talk with Diefenbaker is only the first that the Prime Minister will want to have with U.S. officialdom . The opening moves are under way for the Prime Minister to visit President Eisenhower later this year . <P> <P> Getting Along . To almost every Canadian , the U.S. is an enveloping fact of life . Most of the population lives within 200 miles of the U.S. border . Collectively , Canadians travel south of the border some 27 million times a year , and get some 27 million visits by U.S. residents in return . Buffalo TV stations regularly draw bigger audiences in Toronto than does the government-owned Canadian Broadcasting Corp . Canadian Novelist Hugh ( Two Solitudes ) MacLennan complained recently that a Canadian writer has to get his book published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Canada and the U.S. want to get along , can get along , and most of the time they do get along . But the closeness of contact makes irritation inevitable . In the last three years Ottawa has sent half a dozen stiff notes to Washington protesting U.S. trade restrictions . The case of Canadian Diplomat Herbert Norman , who killed himself in Cairo after a U.S. Senate subcommittee revealed that he once had Communist connections , inspired bitter diplomatic notes and an outburst of anti-U.S . editorials . Proud that their currency is robustly solid , Canadians are furious when some U.S. shopkeeper or cab driver turns down a Canadian dollar : " It 's worth $1.05 ! " they protest in frustration .
