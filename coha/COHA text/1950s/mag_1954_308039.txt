In a classroom at the University of Chicago one morning last week , a group of city high-school students wrestled with an odd sort of problem . The class happened to be in mathematics , but the sort of math the teen-agers were tackling went far beyond anything that even most college students know . Based partly on the theories of Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell , it involved symbolic logic and sentence calculus . " Logically valid conditionals and bi-conditionals , or the implications they embody , " blithely explained the professor , " give rise not only to rules of sound inference-by which to proceed step by step through an argument-but to overall plans of attack which can result in various strategies of proof . " With that in mind , the class proceeded to translate a series of statements into equally valid equations : e.g. , " The White Sox win , or the Yankees win . The Yanks do not win . The White Sox win , " which became ( ( PVQ ) ? ? Q ) - &gt; P. <P> Bold Experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chicago 's precollegiate education program , this sort of work is part of a bold new experiment . A professor of education with a Ph.D . in Greek , Dunkel has long been worried about the " enormous gap in communication " between the nation 's high-school teachers and its college professors . ( " Communication between the two groups is not only bad , it is practically nonexistent . " ) Last summer , with a $30,000 grant from the Ford Foundation 's Fund for the Advancement of Education , Dunkel started some college-level courses for high-school pupils , invited a number of high-school teachers to sit in as observers . In this way , says he , " you not only get the two groups of teachers together to discuss their problems , but you get them to work together on living students . It 's also just about the only way to answer the old argument that the college expects too much of the high school : if you expose high-schoolers to college work , you can soon find out . " <P> This summer 160 pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The students are all volunteers , and in selecting them , the university picked the first applicants that came along until its quota was filled . Each student can take two of the seven courses offered ; the university asks no questions about his scholastic record , or even whether he intends to go on to college . <P> Healthy Antidote . Whether he goes to college or not . he certainly gets a taste of it . In English composition last week , students were analyzing the fine points of style in Mark Twain 's Life on the Mississippi . In biology they were examining the dominant and recessive characteristics of a generation of fruit flies , and in the humanities course their discussion ranged from early Greek metrical forms to a comparison of a Beethoven string quartet and T. S. Eliot 's Four Quartets . In social studies they have sampled everything from De Tocqueville to William Graham Sumner . But however tough the work , they seem to thrive . Says Chicago 's Assistant Professor Guy Omer Jr . of his science class : " I drew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of high-school kids has on the whole done as well in five weeks ' time as our third-year college students .
