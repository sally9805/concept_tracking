One nation , under God , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all . <P> Instead of tossing a dignified clerical hat into the air at Congress ' decision to insert the words " under God " in the pledge of allegiance to the Flag ( TIME , May 17 ) , the Episcopal Living Church this week confined itself to a stern little sermon on its meaning : " <P> The invocation of the Almighty . . . is a serious business . God is not easily flattered , and we suspect that His interest in this reference to Him is conditioned strictly by the extent to which our national decisions and policies and actions are ' under God ' . . . <P> " So let us not understand ' under God ' as a declaration of national righteousness . <P> Let us rather understand it as an admission of national imperfection and incompleteness . It is a declaration of internationalism because we know that God loves all men impartially ; a confession of sin because we know that only Christ is without sin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not spiritually strong enough to die redemptively ; and , withal , a declaration of trust and hope because we believe that ( since Christ did die redemptively ) God has a mission for us that is within our power to fulfill.
