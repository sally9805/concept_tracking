With the college football season a third complete , national and regional pictures began shaking down : The game of the week was at South Bend , Ind. , where Army used its famed " lonesome end " chiefly as a decoy to loosen Notre Dame defenses , sent Halfbacks Bob Anderson and Pete Dawkins slashing downfield in a 14-2 victory that established the Cadets as the class of the country . <P> Texas struck a blow for the underdog by unhorsing mighty Oklahoma 15-14 on Bob Lackey 's extra-point kick after Substitute Quarterback Vince Matthews mounted a fourth-quarter touchdown drive to tie the Sooners . <P> In the South , a new challenger appeared for the Southeast Conference title when Louisiana State sprang Backs Billy Cannon and Red Brodnax loose on Miami in a 41-0 slaughter . Less impressive was Defending Champion Auburn , defensively superb but unimaginative on offense in a plodding 8-0 victory over Kentucky . Wisconsin 's crunching defense dogged Purdue passers all day , cashed two pass interceptions and a blocked kick for scores in a 31-6 victory . On the West Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's leading ground-gainer , averaged 11.3 yds. a carry for 135 yds. as little ( enrollment : 1,670 ) College of the Pacific rolled over Brigham Young 26-8 . Outgained in all departments , Navy made use of a rocklike defense to stop Michigan drives seven times , pull a 20-14 upset to label itself a slight threat to Army in the East . Cornell proved once more the folly of Ivy League teams competing outside their own bailiwick . The undefeated Big Red got mauled 55-0 by Syracuse in a game so lopsided that Syracuse Coach Ben Schwartzwalder had to send for an old set of jerseys to have enough to mercifully suit up his fifth-stringers.
