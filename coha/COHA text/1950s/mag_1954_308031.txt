Art , like crime , does not pay-although there are exceptions in both cases . Most artists must neglect their muses to earn their livelihoods , and most of them consider this a shame . Not so a tall , green-eyed Norwegian named Bjorn Sather . Sather , a brilliant painter and woodcut artist , was settling down this week to a day laborer 's job in a Montreal furniture factory , yet he thought that everything was just wonderful . He and his wife and two children were able to eat hamburgers again after existing for weeks on spaghetti and oak leaves ( oak leaves are good raw , he says , with sugar ) . Soon he would be able to buy materials to take up art once more . <P> The son of an Oslo jeweler and an apprentice jeweler himself , Sather turned to art after he bought his young wife a paintbox for Christmas . " She never got it , " he says . " I started in painting myself and found I could n't stop . " Sather went to art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada with his family . His reasons : " A Canadian consul in Norway told me this was a wonderful country . Besides , I had n't been here before . If you walk on the same street too many times , you do n't see anything . " <P> He found work in a factory , painted when he could . Last year Sather had a show in Winnipeg which netted $800 . With that , he bundled his family into a 1938 Ford station wagon and rattled off to Mexico . They lived in a shack in the jungle near Acapulco , and Sather came down with malaria . " But I have an attack only once a month , " he says . " I 'm so healthy , I 'm a dynamo . I need only four hours ' sleep a night . " On their way back to Canada , the Sathers visited U.S. museums by day , camped in the fields when darkness fell . The trip took all their remaining funds . Until Sather found his new job , the going was rough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artist is curiously gentle . He portrays the half-hidden things of nature-a fish in a clump of water weeds , a frog squatting in shadow . He draws clearly and delicately , in a style that seems more Chinese than European . His is not the sort of art to startle the world into acceptance , yet it may well grow to command great respect . He is only 37 , and wholly dedicated . <P> " If you wish to do something . " says Sather matter-of-factly , " you can do it . My wife and I both had everything we wanted as children ; now we 've learned to appreciate what we can get . I believe my old station wagon is as good as a Rolls-Royce , if my car can make the trip . "
