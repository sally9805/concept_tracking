Rolling into Germany with salvage crews and empty freight cars , the Soviet conquerors of 1945 carted off everything of value . To Mother Russia went East Germany 's largest factories , her atom scientists , aircraft designers and skilled laborers , goods worth $12 billion . But in 1950 the Reds decided that instead of taking out what little was left , they would let East German ) - build up again and then drain off the profits . This experiment has paid off handsomely for Moscow , made East Germany the Kremlin 's lustiest satellite . Last week East German production had increased to such a level that the government announced it will cut the work week from 48 hours to 45 , which might also help pacify any rebellious workers . <P> Cut Rates &; Copying . East Germany gets few benefits from its recovery . Its best products are for export only , some 80% of its trade is with the Soviet bloc . Russia alone takes 47% of her exports of machinery , electrical equipment and optical instruments , reportedly at cut-rate prices set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is up to 2,000 , - ooo tons , brown coal up to 200 million tons , electricity up to 29 billion kw-h for 1,955 , all double the 1936 output and way ahead of the wartime peak in 1943 . Western authorities tend to accept these statistics , admit that the industrious Germans have made remarkable progress since 1950 by putting everyone to work and using women in backbreaking men 's jobs . <P> One of the better export industries that have risen from the ruins is the mammoth Carl Zeiss optical works at Jena . Forty percent bombed out during the war and dismantled by the Russians , it was rebuilt by the Germans , now makes cameras , binoculars and scientific instruments on a par with the West 's . Machines approaching Western standards and below Western prices are coming from the more efficient nationalized factories , among them Magdeburg 's Ernst Thalmann Heavy Machine Works , which the East Germans pieced together with infinite patience from scavenged old machinery and parts imported and smuggled from the West . In electronics , former subsidiaries of large West Germany corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copying West German products . Some even improve on Western designs . <P> Sick Call &; Slowdowns . Not all the humming new factories do so well . East Germany 's Communist Party Chief Walter Uhlbricht complains that 70% of East Germany 's machine and machine-tool output is not up to world standards , and productivity is low . East Germany 's own statistics admit that workers spend 30% of their 48-hour week away from the job , attending party functions or " spontaneous " rallies where Communist functionaries often petition for extra shifts at no extra pay . Furthermore , almost 7% of East Germany 's man-hours trickle away in sick call ( v. 3% in West Germany ) , largely because workers prefer to get sickness compensation rather than wait out plant slowdowns and receive the lower scale of layoff pay .
