Untangling the knotted skein of corruption that spewed from the power reel of Teamster Boss Dave Beck , the select Senate committee investigating labor racketeering has turned up some devastating evidence . Even so , many a rank-and-file teamster could still tell himself that Good Old Dave had the boys ' interests at heart , no matter what he did . Last week , as the hearings took on a new reel . Good Old Dave turned out to be Bad Old Dave for even the toughest teamster . Reason : testimony plainly showed that Dave 1 ) used the Teamsters , whenever it suited his money-hungry whims , as a useful adjunct to Dave Beck 's business enterprises , and 2 ) cheated the widow of an honored union official in his relentless pursuit of a few easy bucks . <P> As the week 's hearings began , Dave himself sat down in the committee room , rolled out about 30 Fifth Amendment pleas in 32 minutes . But if Dave was not talking , his former business associates were - and what they had to say should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The talkers : <P> Irving J. Levine , tight-lipped president of K &; L Beverage Co. , told how he and Beck sweet-talked St. Louis ' Anheuser-Busch into giving Levine 's company the sole distributorship of Budweiser in Seattle , and later in other areas of Beck 's domain of Washington and Alaska . Then , said Levine , Dave Beck Jr . and a partner each put up $24,500 for a total of 49% interest in K &; L , and Dave Jr . became vice president of the company . Two years later , Mrs. Dave Beck Sr. paid Levine $40,000 for a 40% interest in a K &; L liquor-distributing organization . <P> But Dave Sr. , continued Levine , tried to run the show . " He asked that his son be appointed president of the company . During the course of the discussion , Mr. Beck got quite angry , and I refused to go along with his demands . But then I received a call from my brother saying that the Teamsters refused to unload this particular truckload of whisky . So I mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Well , you see what I mean , Levine , you do n't get along very good with the members of Local 174 , and my family is stockholders in your company . We have got to protect our interest . ' " <P> Since another part of that interest entailed a loan-for which Beck was a guarantor-to Levine 's company from Seattle 's First National Bank , Levine saw what Dave meant . " I asked Mr. Beck , ' Well , you win , what do you want ? ' He said , ' I would like to have my son as president of the company and to have him have the complete say-so of drivers and of trucks . ' So I agreed . That is what I had to do . " Junior promptly became K &; L 's president , and next day the whisky truck was unloaded . Then there was the time , too , when Dave Sr. decreed that Dave Jr . was to receive 5 on every case of " Bud " sold in the Alaska territory , but no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dave politely upped the ante to $1,000 minimum , plus 5 a case .
