txt Government price controllers were in a stew over the beef price situation yesterday . But they had no , quick solution for what to do about it . ? The Office of Price Stabilization Monday announced a cent-a-pound increase in wholesale beef price ceilings . to become effective today . This increase was intended to offset declines in tallow and hide prices . These declines have meant a lower overall return - to meat packers and put the operations of some of them in the red . Even before the meat industry could get any benefit from the permissible beef price increase , the cent-a-pound gain was completely wiped out by rising livestock prices Monday and yesterday . One O.P.S. official yesterday described the beef situation as " very serious . " He said the agency 's whole beef price control program is " in danger . " and that " something is likely to give at any time . " Price boss Michael V. DiSalle hgcl nothing to say on the beef question . But he indicated he would know more later in the week . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide what his next move should be . though he did n't want to go into details yesterday . He had no comment on the rise in cattle prices that has just about wiped out the beneath of the wholesale beef price boost . An O.P.S. spokesman suggested the answer to the beef muddle may lie in price controls on cattle-raisers ' sales rather than on packers ' purchases as at present Cattle raisers can sell their livestock for whatever they can get , but packers ' purchases during a monthly accounting period must average out to no more than ceilings set by the O.P.S. The O.P.S. official admitted , however , that if present ceilings on packers ' purchases ca n't be enforced , there seems to be little chance of enforcing ceilings at the growers level . While O.P.S. meat men were trying to figure out their next move on beef , the agency 's enforcement division broadened its enforcement drive by sending investigators into Chicago . Cleveland . Philadelphia and Newark to make spot checks into the operations of slaughtering houses . Enforcement Chief Edward Morgan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they should for cattle and covering up by boosting their estimates of yield and even by falsifying records and invoices . He said he hoped his new drive would stop violations and also help bring cattle prices down to the point where slaughterers who are abiding by price ceilings can get their cattle requirements . Some packers have complained they ca n't operate under the ceilings and stay in business . Wilson &; Co. announced last weekend it would have to suspend slaughtering operations in its Chicago plant for one week in each accounting period . Mr. Morgan said special attention is to be paid to grading and yield of dressed beef from live cattle purchases . Packers in buying animals estimate both yield and grade . " We hope by this stepped up enforcement survey not only to curb illegal practices and bring violators to justice , but also to bring the price of live cattle on the market in line so that slaughterers who are in compliance can purchase sufficient cattle to continue in business . " Morgan said . He added that court orders will be sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
