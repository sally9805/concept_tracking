After 20 years of syndicated punditing , Columnist Walter Lippmann last week let readers in on a handy trick of his trade . " No one can have been writing for newspapers for a long time , " he wrote , " without being fully aware of how much safer it is to prophesy disaster than to venture to express a hope . It is safe to be gloomy . If one prophesies disaster and it happens , one has been a true prophet . And if it does not happen , one is readily forgiven and may even suggest that but for the warning the disaster would have happened . "
