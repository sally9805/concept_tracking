Ever since his days as Harry Truman 's Secretary of the Air Force , Missourian Stuart Symington has been a man with a mission . A kind of national gadfly , he has stung the U.S. conscience with ominous reminders of the growth of Soviet military power . Last week , in Philadelphia , Freshman Senator Symington charged that the U.S. Government itself had soft-pedaled the Russian threat . Said he : " It is a sad fact that for a long time some of our national leaders-in both parties-have not told us the whole brutal truth about the world in which we live . " <P> Democrat Symington recalled to his listeners the complacency fostered by the Truman Administration . In October 1949 , the month after the Russians exploded their first atom bomb , the Truman Administration decided to cut U.S. armed strength . Even Chinese intervention in Korea , said Symington , " did not bring us to our senses . . . We were told that we could handle this new Soviet aggression with one hand , while we piled the other hand high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the Administration has changed . But one thing has not changed . The policy of butter and guns has not shifted in favor of guns . . . I do not believe this policy is right . Nor would the American people believe it right if they knew the truth . " <P> The Government , said he , should publish answers to such questions as these : <P> " How many jet bombers has the Soviet ? How many has the United Nations ? <P> " How many jet fighters for defense against Russian atomic bombers has the United Nations ? <P> " What is our Government 's estimate of that date when the Soviets may have what they consider enough atomic weapons to launch a successful attack . . . against the U.S. ? <P> " Is the size and form of our defense program aimed toward the maximum national defense possible against atomic attack by that date ? <P> " In other words , will we be ready when that critical day comes ? " <P> Concluded Symington : " The answer , in my opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case , why not give the facts to the people . . . Once the truth is understood , Americans will accept any challenge , will make any sacrifice to the end that they and their children can become strong-and therefore remain free .
