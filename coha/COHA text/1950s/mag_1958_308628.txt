One reason why Texas liked Ike in 1952 was that Candidate Eisenhower came out foursquare for giving the states title to the disputed " tidelands " - and Texas expected to pump a lot of revenue out of offshore oil . In a campaign speech in Houston that year , Ike even endorsed Texans ' claim that their state really extends three marine leagues ( 10 miles ) out into the Gulf of Mexico , just as the Republic of Texas did before it joined the U.S. in 1845 . Ike kept the campaign promise : in 1953 he signed a bill ( similar to bills that Harry Truman had vetoed ) turning over to the states the " submerged lands " out to the three-mile limit - " unless " the state 's " historic " boundary lay farther out . Texas was mighty pleased . <P> Last week the Justice Department filed in the Supreme Court a Texas-sized 425-page brief - the longest federal brief in the court 's history . It argued that Texas , Louisiana and the other gulf states reach only three miles out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100 million in oil revenues collected from drillers operating beyond the three-mile limit . The U.S. , said the brief , has always fixed its national boundary at three miles offshore and has urged other nations to do likewise . " Manifestly , state boundaries can not extend beyond the national boundary . By annexing Texas , the U.S. certainly did not commit itself to relinquish what has been a fundamental cornerstone of its world policy . That would mean in effect that Texas was not annexed to the U.S. , but that the U.S. was annexed to Texas . "
