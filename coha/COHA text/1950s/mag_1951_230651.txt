It was a cheery week for the Met and for U.S. symphony orchestras . After Nov. 1 , thanks to the new federal tax law , nonprofit musical organizations are exempt from the 20% federal admissions tax . TheNew York Philharmonic-Symphony got a separate windfall . Grieved by news that the Philharmonic suffered its worst deficit in history last year ( $110,000 ) , the 65 musicians of the Austin ( Texas ) Symphony Orchestra ( last year 's deficit : $4,000 ) chipped in $1 apiece , sent their collection along to help the New Yorkers . <P> Italian opera companies got no fiscal comfort at all . The economy-minded Italian Senate recommended that the government 's annual subsidy to opera ( last year 2 billionlire-about $3,000,000 ) be cut in half . Among those badly hit , if the government follows the Senate 's advice : Milan 's famed La Scdla , which counts on its 400 million-lire subsidy for half of its budget .
