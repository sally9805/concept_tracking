txt WASHINGTON , July 10 ? Abraham Teitelbaum , once counsel of the late Chicago mob chief Al Capone , refused to tell a Senate committee today about his associations and activities . Mr. Teitelbaum , a chubby , sun-tanned , 50-year-old lawyer , relied on four amendments to the Constitution and held a fifth one in reserve . " ' He declined to answer committee questions about eighty times . Senator John L. McClellan , Democrat of Arkansas , and chairman of the Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field , broadly implied that the committee planned to cite Mr. Teitelbaum for . contempt . The committee 's interest in Mr. Teitelbaum was evident in the . testimony of other V7itnesses today and yesterday . They cited his association with underworld characters who dominated several Chicago locals of the Hotel and Restaurant Employes and Bartenders International Union . One witness , Edward H. Reade , a restaurant- owner , 1 testifigd that in 1950. he made a $150 pay-off to a union leader , Frank Trungale , in the presence of Mr. Teitelbaum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chicago Restaurant Association . Later , ' a Chicago police lieutenant , Joseph Morris , told of a plot %Sr two underworld figures to push Mr. Teitelbaum from his office window into Michigan // Avenue . The lieutenant said the pair had figured that the lawyer was in so much trouble , professionally and domestically , that his death would look like suicide . The two plotters , Joseph Weinberg and Paul ( Needlenose ) Labriola , were later poisoned and strangled . Lieutenant Morris linked another Chicago lawyer , Robert S. Greenfield , to a racket with Weinberg and Labriola , unconnected with the Teitelbaum death plot . Mr. Greenfield called the lieutenant 's testimony , in some respects , " a complete , unadulterated lie . " He said telephone calls to his family had threatened him with death , and he suspected Weinberg and Labriola . Mr. Greenfield acknowledged that he was the unpaid " counsel " for a short time to the federated retail liquor dealers and tavern owners association . He said his objective was to get a law requiring hearings before revocation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much power in that area they were " shaking down " the tavern owners . Sinister Motive Seen Lieutenant Morris attributed a sinister motive to the association . He said Mr. Greenfield and his associates had set out to get control of distribution of liquor and beer in the Chicago area . Mr. Teitelbaum did considerable talking without directly answering questions . When his name was called he proposed reading a statement immediately before the oath was administered . When Chairman McClellan overruled this the lawyer jammed several sheets of notes into his pocket and sat down . On the first question about himself and his background , he declared that he had once testifield voluntarily before the King Committee ( a House of Representatives tax committee in 1951 ) and that the Internal Revenue Service has been hounding him ever since . " Further than that I refuse to answer , " he said . He then cited his support : the First Amendment against unlawful search and seizure ; the Fifth Amendment , because an answer " might tend to incriminate and degrade me " ; the Sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel and the people who retained me have a right to keep their testimony in confidence " ; the Sixteenth . Amendment , " the income tax amendment . " He said he had been indicted twice for income tax violations , had faced two disbarment proceedings , and was ? now petitioning the courts for an income tax refund . On a later question , Mr. Teitelbaum cited all these amendments and , added : " I may plead the Fourteenth Amendment yet . " This referred to the right of " due process . " Mr. Teitelbaum would not answer the question whether he was a citizen . He refused to say whether he was a lawyer , but gave the in formation indirectly , if not inadvertently , by referring to " my twenty-nine years as a lawyer . " Mr. McClellan , overruling all objections except the Fifth Amendment , directed the witness to answer two questions : where he was born , and when . The witness refused .                  @ @ @
