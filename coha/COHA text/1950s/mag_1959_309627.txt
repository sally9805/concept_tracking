For the first peacetime month since the depression times of 1937 , the U.S. imported more than it exported last June . Excluding military goods , exports dipped to $1,348,000,000 and imports rose to $1,369,000,000 , up a walloping 33% from the year-ago level . Reporting the figures last week , the Commerce Department warned the U.S. to expect several more months of trade imbalance . In 1959 the U.S. will show an export surplus , but just barely . Exports , which dropped from a record $19.5 billion in 1957 to $16.3 billion last year , will slide to an estimated $16 billion . Imports will go up from $12.8 billion to about $15 billion . <P> These figures are the latest and sharpest reminder of the steady erosion in the once dominant U.S. trade position around the world . As the industrial plants of West Europe and Japan ( see below ) become larger and more efficient , often by adopting U.S. methods and automation , competition for world markets grows tougher by the day . The U.S. is being challenged in some of its prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign-made appliances to agricultural machinery . <P> Nosing down are U.S. shipments of aircraft ( foreign lines are waiting for the jets ) , cotton ( buyers are holding back for a price cut expected later this year ) , coal ( Europe has a big surplus ) . Dropping also are exports of machinery and steel , cars and oil , for the same reasons that U.S. imports of them are steaming up : the foreign products are plentiful , low in price and of good quality . Comparing the first halves of 1958 and 1959 , U.S. imports of electrical apparatus , electronics parts and transistor radios went up from $72 million to $96 million , imports of industrial machinery from $89 million to $115 million , iron and steel products from $93 million to $229 million , cars and parts from $248 million to $424 million , oil and its products from $806 million to $842 million . <P> No responsible economist predicts a serious or sustained U.S. trade imbalance ahead . But no one foresees the big , fat trade surpluses that the U.S. long enjoyed - $6.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under Secretary of State C. Douglas Dillon , exports will rise $1 billion in the next year , led by lower-priced U.S. cotton and the new jets . These new realities of world trade have moved the Administration to take a sterner view of foreign nations that still jealously preserve high tariffs and import quotas against dollar goods long after the need is past . At next month 's annual meeting of the World Bank in Washington , the Administration will launch its strongest campaign yet to persuade other nations to ease their trade barriers against the U.S.
