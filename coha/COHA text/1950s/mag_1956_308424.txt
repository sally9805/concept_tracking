Ray Cone was not trying to turn his daughter into an athlete . Cone , a safety director for a Teterboro , N.J. factory , taught six year-old Carin to swim for a perfectly prosaic reason : he did not want to worry when the family went holidaying on the Jersey shore . But Ray Cone knew an athlete when he saw one . Little Carin took to the water so naturally that he sent her to a swimming coach to find out how good she really was . Today , at 16 , Carin is good enough to hold all four American women 's backstroke titles ( 100 and 200 yds. , 100 and 200 meters ) . Last week , in the National A.A.U. 's women 's championships at Tyler , Texas , Carin pinwheeled up the Olympic ( 50-meter ) course to a new record of 2:43.8 in the 200-meter backstroke . Next night she lowered the American 100 meter backstroke mark to 1:14.5 . <P> The transition from carefree vacationer to record-breaking competitor was no romp in the surf . Ever since Carin decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grind . In the winter she works out five days a week in the Y.M.-Y.W.C.A. pool near her Ridgewood home . Once a week she travels to Manhattan for professional training at the Women 's Swimming Association . When the weather warms up , she spends every day at Ridgewood 's outdoor municipal pool , swims a mile morning and evening when the pool is uncrowded . " Afternoons , " says Carin , " I put on my plaid bathing suit and go down with the kids and have a good time . " There , she is always careful not to outdo her male friends . <P> Understandably , the routine is sometimes wearing . " In the dead season between the Nationals , " says Carin , " that 's when it gets discouraging . I say to myself , ' If you do n't want to do more than half , you can stop . ' But when I get halfway , I say , ' There , you 've done that much ; now you can do the rest of it . ' " <P> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 200-meter race , she joined the other girls in the coffee shop at Tyler 's Blackstone Hotel . Between events , blonde , blue-eyed Carin was just another casual , crop-haired , broad-shouldered , high-school girl-as cool and pretty as peach ice cream , and bouncingly healthy . But like the others who had also set their share of records ( the Walter Reed Swim Club 's Shelley Mann set new world marks of 1:11.8 in the 100 meter butterfly , 2:44.4 in the 200-meter butterfly , and 5:52.5 in the 400-meter medley ) , Carin knew that her toughest races were still to come . All are pointing for next month 's Olympic trials in Detroit . There the winners will be paid off with a plane trip to Melbourne .
