SOUTH VIET AM <P> As if to celebrate the first anniversary of his coming to power , Premier Ngo Dinh Diem struck three heavy blows last week against the Hoa Hao ( pronounced Wha-How ) , the second of his country 's rebellious warlord sects . Diem sent in two nationalist infantry divisions and four amphibious groups against the Hoa Hao , a rowdy private army of dissident Buddhists who run their own feudal entity-and squeeze the peasants with taxes-in rice-rich western Viet Nam . Premier Diem first offered the Hoa Hao a chance to integrate themselves into the national army and form a peaceful political party , but the Hoa Hao replied by raiding Diem 's outposts and blowing up bridges . Ba Cut , commander of the Hoa Hao army , who wears his hair neck-long in protest against the Geneva Treaty , threatened to behead Ngo Dinh Diem as a warning to those who did not fear the mighty Hoa Hao . <P> Behind a brisk barrage from 105-mm field guns , Diem 's nationalists , led by a 27-year-old colonel , stormed three Hoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black pigs and yellow dogs along with the scurrying Hoa Hao . The nationalists lost 40 killed and wounded , but the show was soon over . Only a few hours after the Diem barrage began , one-third of the Hoa Hao laid down their arms and Commander Ba Cut fled for the hills . <P> " We get good training , fighting the Hoa Hao , " exulted one of Diem 's young commanders . " We keep ourselves in shape , while the Communist army stays idle . " It was hardly that much of a victory for a dissension-torn country : civil wars do not a country make . But winning them is a necessity for Diem if his regime is to last .
