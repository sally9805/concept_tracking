Torch Song ( MGM ) should make a lot of Joan Crawford 's fans uncomfortable . Joan is miscast as a belligerent musi-comedy star who wears her heart on her fist ; the fist is directed mainly at Michael Wilding . Fortunately , the camera decides most of the time that it is more fun to look at Actress Crawford 's remarkable legs . Even this is an obvious mistake , for by reducing a performer of Joan 's experience and hard-won skills to the cheesecake class , the picture stints her of the human qualities she has developed . Best scene : one in which Marjorie Rambeau , as Joan 's mother , a merry old frump , hands around some free advice to her lovelorn daughter , and then amalgamates a ten-oz. glass of beer in one unforgettable chugalug . <P> The Captain 's Paradise ( London Films ; Lopert ) is a wonderfully funny little immorality play about how the Old Adam tries once again to have his apple and eat it too . The Adam in this instance is a middle-class Englishman who looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the part is being played by Alec Guinness , who , in recent films ( Kind Hearts and Coronets , The Promoter ) , has been hilariously demonstrating that the dullest-seeming people may be the most fascinating monsters . <P> This time , Guinness plays the captain of a ferry steamer plying between Gibraltar and Morocco . A quite ordinary fellow to all appearances , he is what might be described as a commuting bigamist . <P> On the Gibraltar side , the captain goes soberly afoot from his ship to a conventional middle-class cottage . There he is cozily greeted by wife No. i , a plain but devoted homebody ( Celia Johnson ) who puts out his pipe and porter , serves up his favorite dumplings , and answers dutifully to his call for " beddy-byes " at 10 p.m . Otherwise , as the captain explains , he would be " no use on the bridge . " <P> On the African side , the captain quick-changes into dove-grey flannels and a snap-brim felt , darts to a waiting taxi and heads , by way of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tonier hotels . There he is passionately greeted by wife No. 2 , a sexy , black-haired baggage ( Yvonne de Carlo ) who throws the cootch around in nightclubs , guzzles champagne , and takes moonlight plunges in the Mediterranean . <P> So it goes for years , with nobody the wiser . One night with one wife , one with the other . " Two women , " as the captain congratulates himself , " each with half of the things a man wants . " It 's all too good to last , of course-so good that it is worth the price of admission to find out what goes wrong . <P> As the captain , Actor Guinness is consistently at the height of his own special comedy style . Appearing to be acting not at all , he creates a sort of emotional vacuum at the center of his role into which the spectator 's feelings are drawn . Guinness always waits that extra moment until his audience sees what obviously must be done , and then he does it , almost as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkably effective technique , and never more so than when he unexpectedly crosses the audience up .
