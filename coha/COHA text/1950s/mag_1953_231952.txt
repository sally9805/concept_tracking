Many a Hollywood movie lacks a real theme , but practically every movie these days has a theme song . The man on top of the trend is Dimitri Tiomkin , a 54-year-old concert pianist turned composer , who made a deep impression on the industry and the rest of the U.S. with one folksy tune : Do Not Forsake Me , Oh My Darling ( from High Noon ) . <P> Composer Tiomkin , who speaks fractured English splinted with a Russian accent , explains : " Hollywood begin to come to song mostly from matter of exploitation . . . When I make the title tune for High Noon , I think song help make continuity , musical dissolves , time element ... I thinking this picture a little bit too static . Music give feeling of action . I get inspiration from American bandit songs from Carl Sandburg 's American Song Bag . " The tune , with Lyricist Ned Washington 's help , soon became a jukebox favorite , has sold almost 2,000,000 records . Tiomkin has already earned more in royalties than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this business , " says Tiomkin , " they begin to follow with these ideas . First Dore Schary called on account of High Noon and said . ' Dimitri , I need song from could be good infantry march . ' " Tiomkin wrote Take the High Ground and Hold It for MGM 's Take the High Ground . Then he composed the theme for Return to Paradise . <P> Although Do Not Forsake Me is Tiomkin 's first popular hit , he has been writing movie music in Hollywood for 20 years ( Lost Horizon , You Ca n't Take It With You , Shadow of a Doubt , Strangers on a Train , Red River , The Big Sky ) . But not until he worked on U.S. Army orientation films during World War II did he discover the real purpose of his craft . Says he : " I learn to write ... not just for concert but for screen , combine music with sound and dialogue . Sometimes you give a little help to film . " But he adds with a sigh and a shrug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for symphony orchestra . " <P> Tiomkin agrees that his newest job is a tough one . The picture : a melodrama called Dial M for Murder . Says he : " I ca n't make theme song with title ... I think it will be little bit novelty song , a kind of song about dialing phone with little bit orchestral effect ... It will be just melody in picture , and then words will be written afterwards so melody be suited for exploitation . "
