txt Letters to The Times ro THE EDITOR OF THE Nzw YORK TIMES : In a news dispatch from Washington , fated July 3 , President Truman 's Council of Economic Advisers is reported to have criticized New England for an attitude described as " ' a sense Df independence ' ? of self-reliance -- of a propensity to combine shrewdness in economic ventures with a strong sense of pride in. social and political inheritances . " Because of this , the report says , New England has " lacked the venturesomeness necessary " for keeping up with economic progress . This writer , born in the  --  Midwest and just recently moved to the southern fringe of New England , is not subject to purely sectional bias . New England has its faults . But the principle inherent in the council 's observations on New England extends beyond the geographical area that the report covers . When did a sense of independence , of self-reliance , become a fault anywhere in this country ? And how does such an attitude react to restrain the venture spirit which the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is confused as to the reasons for its own conclusions . It is only conjecture , but it looks as though the council started with preconceived conclusions and proceeded backward in search of reasons which do not exist . Reduced to absurdity ( which is not difficult ) , what the council is saying is that a sense of independence results in a lack of initiative ! In our present socio-economic situation the alternative to a sense of independence as an individual is a sense of security as a part of the whole . Can it be the conclusion of the council that substituting security for independence will- produce initiative ? Or would it be more truthful to say that the council , notwithstanding its lofty references to the subject , really does not think that initiative is very important , after all ? Would a system of Government social and economic guarantees eliminating the values of both independence and initiative be most desirable to the council ? Either the council has indulged in some objective " reasoning , " without due regard for subjective analysis , or it has just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct advisers during a period of accelerated social and economic change may go a long way to determine policy . At that level the people certainly expect the benefit of thinking that is both sound and sincere . Let us hope that future reports of the Council of Economic Advisers are more constructive , or at least honestly critical . CHARLES C. LEININGER . Darien , Conn. , July 9 , 1951 . Restoring Unity to Korea To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The offer of Soviet Chief Jacob Malik to open armistice negotiations in Korea at this particular time can be explained only by the imminent collapse of Communist forces in Korea , for no moral rebirth of Mr. Malik and his boss , Stalin , has been noticed by anyone . It would seem that now is the time to realize the minimum aim of the United Nations  --  the restoration of tile freedom and unity of the Korean people , who suffered nearly 3,000,000 casualties , together with compensation for property destroyed and resources blighted . Without this aim accomplished the U. N. will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of millions of people oppressed and enslaved by the Communists , or those threatened by such a fate . On the contrary , its prestige will ' have fallen to the lowest levels and make it practically useless . The same inglorious fate awaits us , the United States . This will be not the only blunder of our present Administration if through cease-fire negotiations it establishes the Thirty-eighth Parallel as the artificial line dividing Korea in two , without positive guarantee against future aggressions by the Communists . The other fatal blunder will be that of giving the Chinese Communists the time and opportunity to rest , to bind their wounds and to start the build-up of much greater forces and arms industries , prinicpally in Manchuria , than they now have . It is the duty of all informed and patriotic citizens to stop , think , search their hearts , come to reasonable conclusions now before it is too late , and get in touch with their Congressmen and the President . S. SIDNEY BROMBERG . Ridgefield Park , N. J. , July 12 , 1951 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIMES : Let the United States of America renounce any pretense to world leadership so far as moral and spiritual values go now that it barters with Communists without first requiring that they restore to dignity the nations and the people they have enslaved . Let the United States be content to say , " We lead the world ? in material things ! " S. OSBORN BALL . Provincetown , Mass. , July 11,1951 . Founders of Free French Movement To Ms EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Truss : With congratulations and all good wishes to Count Guerin de Beaumont for his victory in the recent French elections , it is to be regretted that THE NEW YORK TIMES gave erroneous information in its Paris dispatch published July 2 attributing to him the role of founder in the United States of the Free French movement . The Free French movement owes its creation and successful development to Eugene Houdry , Eugene Gentil , Frederic Hoffherr , Pierre Quilleret , Roger Brunschwig , Michel Wibault , Albert Simard , Oswald Chew and Gen. Wite Liam J. Price .14 . The said- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Free French in Philadelphia , gave their efforts , time , money , anxiety and heartaches to the cause from August , 1940 , to the end of the Second World War . They should get the recognition they deserve . Count Guerin de Beaumont came to New York long after the charter of the Free French movement was approved and signed in Philadelphia . ANTOINETTE NOEL HOFFHERR . New York , July 2 , 1951 . Street Parking Opposed Hazards and Disadvantages of Leaving Cars Out Are Discussed Answering your correspondent M. H .. and in support of your editorial of June 26 in reference to " Illegal Parking . " Your pleading lawbreaker charges that storage costs $35 to $40 , As a car owner living in Washington Heights I am paying $16 for storage . There is available space for many more cars at rates up to $20 a month . When a man can stretch his middleclass budget to the tune of $1,500 ? about the lowest price for a small car -- -and then deliberately permit it to become a. piece of junk in the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bumps and scratches and the ballplaying youngsters , he is not using middle-class horse sense . I can not sympathize with M. H. 's inability to find enough space to stash the car away for twelve hours , but I can and do violently disagree with hint when he says he does no harm . He and his ilk are partly responsible for deaths caused by children darting from behind parked cars . He is also responsible in part for the filthy streets . M. H. evidently does not understand what " free traffic " means . When parked cars take sixteen feet from a thirty-five foot roadway it certainly prevents " free traffic . " Does he sincerely believe that the ten-foot fire hydrant law is really sufficient to permit fire apparatus to get to a burning structure ? Refer to the catastrophe of West Seventy-third Street , some years ago , when , because of parked cars , the hook and ladder could not raise the extension . Two or three deaths resulted . I hold no brief for the garage operators , although I have found them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars for thirty-five years ? from Cadillacs to Fords  --  and have never received a ticket for abandoning my car  --  or parking , as they now call it . The cause of major crimes starts with the breakdown of police regulations . The world is in a mess because of disregard for law and order . Keep after the police to enforce " no parking " and you 'll have the thanks of every right-thinking American who only bites off what he can properly masticate . J. J. C. New York , July 4 , 1951 . Safety in Air Travel To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Well-intentioned though they may be , it seems that the Senate Committee on Small Business may be neglecting civil aviation 's most important consideration in their study of non-scheduled airlines . While striving to bring low-cost air transportation to the general public , the committee should realize that safety is the most important element in air travel . From the difficult , nonprofitable pioneer days through the arduous break-even years , and right up to the prl.sent profitable ( at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduled airlines have faced the fact that safe trips , regardless of cost , must be their aim . In building scientific weather departments , setting up elaborate maintenance facilities , studying the infinite variety of pilot helps , the scheduled carriers have poured out immense sums of money , which otherwise could have brought inexpensive mass transportation to the public quickly  --  but on a hit-or-miss basis . In these sane and conservative methods the C. A. B. has backed the airlines to the hilt . Now that bureau is told " that it lacks the scope and daring required . " No carrier  --  scheduled or non-scheduled  --  can maintain the activities essential to safe flight without fair revenues from passengers and freight . Let 's go slowly , then , in bringing inexpensive air travel to the public unless it be on an advertised " Fly at Your Own Risk " basis . PETER J. MCDONNELL . Pelham , July 11 , 1951 .
