GREAT RIVER ( 2 vols. , 1,020 pp. ) - Paul Horgan-Rinehart ( $10 ) . <P> <P> The Rivers of America series is one of those publishing projects that always seems better as an idea than in execution . <P> Except for a few ( e.g. The Monongahela , Everglades ) , the books have seldom risen above the level of scrappy regional history . When New Mexican Novelist Paul Horgan began to do his book on the Rio Grande , it was meant to be one of the series . But in the end , the publishers decided not to include his book , for it towers above the others as a Prescott towers above cracker-barrel chroniclers . Great River is not only a fine job of historical research . It fuses the imagination of a good novelist ( The Fault of Angels ) with a remarkable sense of a region 's character . <P> Author Horgan begins in the dim past before recorded history , with a graceful account of primitive Indian existence . He believes that " they solved with restraint and beauty the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this distance in time he sees them as living " like figures in a dream , waiting to be awakened . " <P> They were " awakened " by the Spaniards , who brought with them both Christianity and visions of wealth . What the incredibly brave and selfless friars brought in the way of spiritual enlightenment was sometimes more than offset by the greed and rapacity of the Spanish governors . For 200 years the Spanish slaughtered and the Indians massacred , but by 1700 the Pueblo Indians were finished as warriors . The Rio Grande enjoyed few stretches of real peace . What with the Indians , the U.S.-Mexican war and the raids of Pancho Villa , Horgan 's pages are seldom free from violence . <P> Great River could easily have drowned in a torrent of blood , but Horgan 's interest in the people and the land is always deeper than any temptation to deal with adventure . There are excellent descriptions of Comanche Indian life , of the cowboy , of frontier towns . But the real triumph of Horgan 's book is his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has woven into his fine prose .
