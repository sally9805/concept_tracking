" l SNEAKED OUT AT NIGHT FOR <P> THRILLS ! ' ' trumpets the April cover of Dell 's Modern Romances . Wails quarterly Secret Confessions ' current cover line : " I COMMITTED ADULTERY ! " Inside the slick color covers , the so-called " confession " or " romance " magazines come through with sagas of sex and suffering that make the most lurid tabloid story read like Mother Goose . In the current issue of Standard Magazines ' True Life Stories , a teen-ager in 7,000 action-packed words recounts her father 's suicide , her poverty-ridden childhood with a lunatic grandmother , rape by a giggling maniac , seduction by her boss 's stepson , addiction to " sex pills , " confinement in a home for delinquent girls . Of eleven stories in the April issue of Macfadden Publications ' True Story , three involve unwed mothers , two concern alcoholism , two feature divorce , another relates the plight of a girl who is forced by scandalmongers into an unwanted marriage . <P> While the primrose path for their heroines leads inevitably to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves are making a heap of tin out of sin . In the last ten years , while the magazine ranks have been riddled by casualties , only two confessional slicks have gone under . Though their combined circulation has fallen to only half the Korean war peak , the fall-off has stopped and today the 24 monthly and quarterly romance-mongers ( top price : 25 ) enjoy a steady circulation of more than 10 million . In the 38 years since the late Muscleman Bernarr ( " Body Love " ) Macfadden blazed the trail with True Story , the confession industry has thrived by sticking to the same trite-and-true formula : first-person stories of subjective sex that are more often fiction than fact , and read like supercharged soap operas . <P> Gamy Gamut . Unlike soap opera , the average confession story runs a gamy gamut of misadventure and misfortune whose-Boccaccian detail is tempered only by the bowdlerized prose of Hollywood . A bastard is a " sin child " or " living proof , " adultery is " cheating . " But in the end , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the blighted past ( " Is he remembering her when he kisses me ? " ) and , overcoming the doom-fraught future ( " A lifetime of not knowing " ) , concludes his or her chronicle on a hopeful note . " Sure , we 're Pollyanna , " shrugs Nina Dorrance , young ( 35 ) editor of superslick True Story ( circ. 2,573,543 ) . " But that 's the way people are . " <P> The people who read confession magazines , says Macfadden Publications , are " Wage-Town " folks . More than 80% of readers are women , mostly married and in the 25-30 age group . Slightly more than 50% finished high school . Their income levels are below-average . Thus , the confession slicks never indulge in drawn-out , complex psychological unravelings or high-flown dialogue .
