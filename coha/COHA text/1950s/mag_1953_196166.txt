Just before he died after only two months as U.S. Commissioner of Education , Lee M. Thurston went on a search for a first-rate deputy . Last week the man he had in mind was named his successor : Samuel Miller Brownell , 53 , brother of U.S. Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr . <P> The son of a professor at the University of Nebraska . Sam Brownell took his doctorate in education at Yale , later became professor of educational administration . In 1947 he also became president of the New Haven State Teachers College . As U.S. Commissioner , Brownell will find himself helping brother Herb with one of the hottest political potatoes of the year : the five school segregation cases , soon to reappear before the U.S. Supreme Court .
