But who cares ? Each May , during Baby &; Child Week , every child , legitimate or illegitimate , is welcome to compete in the baby beauty contest ; the only distinction is that winners whose parents are married get a bonus .

Beth Jacobs is first of all in favor of marriage ; secondly , she proposes to cut the rate of illegitimate births by contraception . The ideals of Planned Parenthood , U.S.-style ( " Every child a wanted child " ) , baffle many a Jamaican sire , but the Beth Jacobs Clinic does its best to spread the word . Last week Mrs. Jacobs was on her way to the International Planned Parenthood Federation 's sixth international conference in New Delhi to report on the results . <P> She has won some support .

Occasional signs chalked on walls say , " Birth control is a plan to kill Negroes . " <P> Beth Jacobs intends to keep trying , but she admits the job is hard . " Even unwed mothers , " she sighs , " left to face their ordeal alone , would rather have had their fling and pay the price than be good spinsters with no love life at all .
