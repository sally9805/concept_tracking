Most people who brood about the horrors of war think of the bomb and forget the germs . Last week Dr. Victor H. Haas , head of the Government 's Microbiological Institute , warned that 1 ) biological warfare is a definite possibility , and 2 ) the U.S. is ill-equipped at present to ward off such an attack . The nation has too few facilities even for detecting the minute organisms that an enemy might use , Dr. Haas told the College of American Pathologists in Chicago , and no organization to combat the widespread disease they might cause . <P> What the U.S. needs , said Dr. Haas , 41 , a veteran of 19 years with the Public Health Service , is a nationwide system of germ-warfare detection centers . They would operate in much the same way as a radar network for detecting the approach of aircraft . But instead of a sky-scanning " bedspring " or " clam shell , " there would be , in each likely target area , a device to force large samples of air through filters on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be analyzed to see whether any unusual microbes had appeared . So would samples of the area 's milk and water supplies . <P> If unusual illnesses developed , suggesting that a biological attack had been launched , germ-warfare experts would gather material from patients , alive or dead , in an effort to identify the cause of the disease . Dr. Haas frankly admitted that even with the precautions he suggested , it was still likely that the first knowledge of such an attack could come some days after it had happened , when the victims began to fall ill . However , he believes that any such epidemic would be short-lived , after casualties from the first exposure . <P> Several of the diseases which Dr. Haas said might be spread by saboteurs or enemy raiders can not be effectively guarded against by inoculation-e.g. , influenza , parrot fever , Q fever , tularemia , some fungus infections , botulism. * And even in cases where immunity can be given , individual inoculation is costly and cumbersome . Dr. Haas suggests that forward-looking researchers try to figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an auditorium by forcing the immunizing agent into the air-circulating system . <P> * Botulin , manufactured by a common bacillus in badly preserved food , is the most deadly poison known : one ounce theoretically could kill 100 million people .
