A pair of railroads that have learned how to stay in the black in good times or bad are the 2,130-mile Norfolk &; Western and the 608-mile Virginian , two of the nation 's major soft-coal-hauling lines . Unlike other Eastern roads , which groan under huge passenger deficits , the N. &; W. carries few passengers and the Virginian none . Despite last year 's Eastern rail slump , the Virginian turned in profits of $11.6 million ( off from $17 million in 1957 ) , while the N. &; W. earned $43.5 million ( off from $44.5 million ) . Last week the two roads decided that profits would rise ever so much higher if they got-together . In announcing merger plans , N. &; W. President Stuart Thomas Saunders and Virginian President Frank D. Beale said that " savings of about $1,000,000 a month can be realized through elimination of duplicating facilities .

The match is Almost certain to be consummated . It has the green light from the Pennsylvania Railroad , which controls about 45% of N. &; W. 's voting stock , and from Boston 's Eastern Gas &; Fuel Associates , which controls more than 50% of the Virginian shares .
