LET IT COME DOWN ( 311 pp. ) - Paul Bowles-Random House ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> Nelson Dyar , American , was " not at all distinguished in appearance . He did not look like an actor or a statesman or an artist , nor yet like a workman , a businessman or an athlete . " Moreover , when the Marquesa de Valverde peered into his palm , she could see " no sign of anything ... an empty hand . " <P> Out of Nelson 's empty hand , nonetheless , Novelist Paul ( The Sheltering Sky ) Bowles has tried to create a modern hero . Dyar is not a man , he is a vacuum . His only deep desire is to fill his own emptiness . He throws up his job as a New York bank teller , takes ship to Tangier , and waits for things to happen to him-any things , so long as they are solid enough to give him the feeling of being in touch with reality . <P> Tangier is only too ready to oblige . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters creeps into Dyar 's empty world . There is Hadija , an Arab prostitute , who gives him the illusion that he is capable of falling in love . There is Jack Wilcox , an American black-marketeer , who turns Dyar into an accomplice in his currency deals . There is Madame Jouvenon , the Soviet agent who hands him a fat check for " small bits of information . " Before long , Dyar is able to feel that he is no longer " supremely anonymous . " By the end of the novel , he has become an undeniably real person : he is hiding out on a mountain top , alone in the world save for the body of the man he has murdered . <P> Novels whose " heroes " are impotent victims of life are at least as old as Franz Kafka and his stories of Central European decay ( TIME , April 28 , 1947 ) . Let It Come Down shows the point such novels have reached in the last decade or two . In the Kafka world , the victim-hero was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bowles world , the victim-hero is both amoral and numb . He will commit any crime in order to give himself the feeling of having " a place in the world , a definite status , a precise relationship with the rest of men . " <P> As a portrait of such a character , Let It Come Down has the merits of clarity , intelligence and melodrama . Its great weakness is that the numbness of the sitter has got into the artist . Like Dyar , Bowles seems incapable of involving himself in at least half the realities of life . He makes his job easy by playing down characters and incidents that might fill his hero 's emptiness with something more amiable than smuggling and murder . He exposes Dyar 's hungry soul to every temptation except the temptation to take a brace . In this way , Bowles takes most of the wind out of his own sails . The Devil likes to be given his due , but he is too much of a realist to ask for a walkover.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
