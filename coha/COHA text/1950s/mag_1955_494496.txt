FOREIGN POLICY IN ONE important respect it is fortunate that the ad- versary in the atomic age is totalitarian Bolshevism rather than totalitarian Nazism . The latter , personified by Hitler and unthinkable without him , was suicidally romantic and naively irrational . There is good reason to believe that the Kremlin , with or without Stalin , resembles the bookie more than the gambler . It will calculate the odds . It will take risks but it wo n't risk everything . It will avoid ventures which might involve ruinous losses even if it has to forego ventures which might yield large gains . As conservative revolutionaries , somewhat sobered by 35 years of power , as compared to Hitler 's six short years in 1939 , they will also liquidate ventures that prove unprofitable or no longer profitable , as in Greece , the Berlin blockade and Korea . On such an appraisal of a fearful , cautious , stubborn and implacable adversary , the uneasy , unsatisfactory status quo must be maintained until some solution can be found to the basic problem of a divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time the mounting tensions of a divided Germany will merge into the larger problems of a divided Europe . Perhaps the Soviet rulers may in time conclude that the withdrawal of British-American forces from a united and really independent Europe is safer and better than maintaining Russian garrisons amid the rising tensions of an unnaturally divided Europe . We should , I believe , be thinking beyond the cold confines of the Cold War . Perhaps the ultimate solution will be a declaration of independence for all of Europe , based on the developing strength of the organs of European unity .. Perhaps there will evolve the concept of an independent united Europe linked with the United States and Britain on the one hand , and the Soviet Union on the other , in mutual security arrangements pledging common resistance against aggression by any one of the three . * ? Much of the world in Asia , Africa and the Middle East is on the way ? sornewhere ; is trying to telescope centuries into decades , trying to catch up with the Western industrial and technological revolutions overnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to accomplish this mighty transformation by the methods of consent , not coercion . A policy based just on anti-Communism and military potency is not in the spirit of this great movement of the Twentieth Century and will win few hearts . The challenge for us is to identify ourselves with this social and human revolution , to encourage , aid and inspire the aspirations of half of mankind for a better life , to guide these aspirations into paths that lead to freedom . To default would be disaster . The great issue , that splits the world in this troubled age , the issue of tyranny or freedom , can not be reconciled . But need it be forced to a decision ? It seems to me the problem is not to find ways to live in harmony with the adversary ; it is to find ways to live beside him in the bitter discord of incessant power and ideological competition . In time there will be a break , sooner perhaps than prudence admits . The infinity of problems we now face can not all be solved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be solved at all . Our choice is to let time assuage or exacerbate . Emotion in matters of national security is no substitute for intelligence , nor rigidity for prudence . To act coolly , intelligently and prudently in perilous circumstances is the test of a man or nation . The responsibility for organizing and sustaining the great coalition befell us Americans suddenly and before we were prepared for it . But we shall have to learn this job quickly-and well . As foreign policy grows out of historical experience , and reflects national character , perhaps it is not irrelevant to this task to consider some aspects of our national character and experience . One of our hardest tasks ? if we hope to conduct a successful foreign policy ? is to learn a new habit of thought , a new attitude toward the problems of life itself . Fortitude , sobriety and patience as a prescription for combating intolerable evil are cold porridge to Americans who yesterday tamed a continent and tipped the scales decisively in two world wars . Americans have always assumed , subconsciously , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy ending ; that the application of enough energy and good will can make everything come out right . In view of our history , this assumption is natural enough . As a people , we have never encountered any obstacle that we could not overcome . The Pilgrims had a rough first winter , but after that the colony flourished . Valley Forge was followed naturally by Yorktown . Daniel Boone always found his way through the forest . We crossed the Alleghenies and the Mississippi and the Rockies with an impetus that nothing could stop . The wagon trains got through ; the Pony Express delivered the mail ; in spite of Bull Run and the Copperheads , the Union was somehow preserved . We never came across a river we could n't bridge , a depression we could n't overcome , a war we could n't win . So far , we have never known the tragedy , frustration and sometimes defeat which are ingrained in the memories of all other peoples . So when we encounter a problem in foreign policy we naturally assume that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination and red corpuscles . " The difficult we do immediately , the impossible takes a little longer . " Just pour in enough man power , money and bulldozers , and we can lick it . If one diplomat ca n't come up with the answer , fire him and hire another ? or better yet , hire 10 . And ' if that does n't solve it , some Americans conclude that there can be only one explanation : treason . Many of the really hard problems in international relations may never be " solved " at all . The conflict between Moslem and Christian , which dominated world politics for some 300 years , was never resolved . Islam and Christianity learned to live together and the problem was submerged in the newer and more urgent problems of the Renaissance , the Age of Discovery , and finally the Industrial Revolution . So with the Thirty Years ' War , which also started a conflict between two ideologies , Protestant and Catholic . The underlying issues were never settled because they were logically irreconcilable ; but they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and class conflict began to emerge as more , pressing issues . Before that war finally petered out , curiously enough , a Catholic Cardinal ? Richelieu ? was organizing the Protestant League , and a Protestant general was leading the armies of the Holy Roman Empire . The struggle had been transformed from one of religious ideology to one of national ambition . It is at least conceivable that the ideological conflicts of our own time will defy solution , in similar fashion , but will be replaced by other problems which we can not now foresee . So the first step in learning our new role in world affairs is not one which can be taken by technicians in the State Department , or even by political leaders . It has to be taken by individual Americans , in the privacy of their own homes , hearts and souls . It involves a conscious acceptance of Christian humility ? a recognition that we are never going to solve many of the hard problems of the world , but will simply have to learn to live with them , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that step , we will no longer call out a posse to find the traitor who was responsible , for " our " loss of China ; or threaten the French with dire punishment if they do n't stop behaving like Frenchmen forthwith . We will no longer be tempted by simple panaceas and total solutions ? a blockade of China , or an arms burden that may crush necessary social changes in weak economies and deliver them to the enemy , or unlimited billions for Point Four , or whatever . On the latter point do n't misunderstand me . Point Four and technical assistance are good medicine , in doses which can be absorbed by responsible and genuinely representative governments . However , I am not one of those who think that economic aid is a miracle drug and a sure cure for all ailments , and especially when if is allocated and judged here at home not on its value in building stable , democratic societies , but on its effectiveness in winning a country , India for example , to our side . As I have indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while highly desirable , is generally not the cause but the consequence of government that has the support of the people so that they will want to , defend it against external aggression or internal subversion . It is hard and futile to defend a government whose people wo n't defend it . We shall have to learn that we can not buy agreement or effective alliances among the new states of the Middle East and Asia with economic or military aid . All we can do , and in my judgment must do , is to help with ? the%uilding of free and independent governments whose people will defend them . Probably the greatest obstacle in the path of peaceful co-existence is the Soviet belief in the inevitability of conflict between the Communist and the non-Communist worlds . And it is true that Soviet intolerance and unwillingness to abide by the rules of peaceful coexistence have shaken our faith in- tolerance and the possibility of peaceful co-existence . But in the atomic era even the most fanatical faith is likely to balk at self-destruction . There is no Iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not penetrate in time . Even the most fanatical ambition must adjust itself to demonstrated truth or perish . No faith can long rest on the belief that the world is flat ? if its adherents know the world is round . " Great is the truth and mighty above all things . " The hope for peaceful co-existence lies in our ability to convince the rulers of the other world that they can not extend their system by force , or by stealth , and that unless they use force against us we will not use force against them ; that our coalition exists but to serve and to save the imperishable principles of the Charter of the United Nations . Intolerant power respects power , not weakness . It is imperative therefore to build and better the balance of power . Conspiracy and incitement prosper in disunion and discontent . It is imperative therefore to build and better the unity and well being of the free world . We can not do it alone . It is imperative therefore to build and better the coalition . And here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A coalition built on expedient reaction to the common danger will not stand , because the Sino-Soviet alliance has the power to blow hot and cold , like Boreas and Phoebus in the fable ; it has the power to relax or increase the tension as it sees fit . But our coalition can not live by fits and starts ; it must rest on an enduring community of interest . And successful communal relations mean give and take , co- operation , ' consultation , accommodation ? a decent respect for the opinions of others . Our coalition is a partnership , not a dictatorship . We shall have to listen as well as talk ; learn as well as teach . And I sometimes think that what America needs more than anything elk is a hearing aid . ? Call to Greatness by Adlai E. Stevenson UNITED NATIONS . MY Y DAYS with the United Nations started first back in the State Department in Washington , in preparation for the San Francisco Conference . Then at that greatest of all international conferences in San Francisco in the springtime 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crumbling , and in San Francisco it looked for a moment like a springtime for all mankind . Then I went to London as Deputy to Edward Stettinius , the Chief of our Delegation to the Preparatory Commission , to set up the United Nations ? to build the structure ? to put the flesh on the bare bones of the great charter that had been hammered ' out in those two great months of springtime in San Francisco . Secretary Stettinius promptly fell ill and had to return to the US and I succeeded him as Chief of the US Delegation and stayed in London for half a year . Then for two years-1946 and 1947 ? I had the privilege of serving as a member of the US Delegation to the General Assembly in New York . Many of the problems which confronted our world 10 years ago have not left us . The funda- , mental facts of international relations remain the same . The " spirit of Geneva " has not blunted the sword of Communist military power or political ambition . The first session of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in shattered London and the tenth session of the General Assembly in that magnificent modern building in New York , both list on their agenda the problems of atomic energy and armaments reduction . As we mark the ending of the first decade of the history of the United Nations what counsel do we take of ourselves for the future ? I would mention only one thing . I sense a willingness to shorten the original limitless vision which inspired the United Nations . It was wise to temper foolish optimism , but there is a danger too that in adjusting or compromising our expectations the whole essential basis of values will become lost or distorted . There are , for example , more important things than just winning votes and small victories in the councils of the UN . Our ultimate object is not just to win votes , but to win confidence ; to win respect , not by our skill in lobbying , but by our reasonableness in debate and discussion . The United Nations is a center of world communication , a place where the power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a place , in John Masefield 's phrase , where men can " clasp the hands and know the thoughts of men in other lands . " ' It must not appear to the world that our aim is just to marshal the faithful and win the daily battle of the-ballots , or just to make sure that no one else gets away with anything . We have so much more than this to offer . Our ultimate role is not to win anything for ourselves ? except a share in world peace . Our role is , in all humility , . to find in common with others the paths to that mutual understanding and confidence which must precede peace . It may well be that we are entering one of the most perilous periods of our century . One can wonder if our security system is coming apart at the seams . One has but to look to North Africa , to France , to the Middle East , to China and Japan . Are the new directions in Germany any more East than West ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war of smiles that we here in America are reassuring each other that all is well ? It is no accident that we are confronted with Communism in Russia and China , two great areas of the world that did not participate in the great political and industrial developments of the last century . Must Asia and Africa go the same way ? There is work to do and the United Nations , will have to do much of it . Better that we stop debating foolish proposals to withdraw from the UN and spend more time considering how we can help in concert with other nations to save the future , ? Chicago , Illinois , October 24 , 1955 EDUCATION A DISCUSSION of education can not be cast just in terms of national needs , or a national policy or a national program . For education can serve the ends of democratic society only as it meets those of the individual human being . The essential condition of the system of free choice between conflicting ideas and leaders , which we call democracy , is that it be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what we demand most of education is the development of informed people who are at the same time unique , different , unpatterned individuals . I think this means , in turn , that any national education policy must encourage difference , experimentation and flexibility in educational practice . A second principle underlying our national educational policy is that whatever control of public education is required should be exercised by local authorities . Our public schools take much of their strength . from the millions of private citizens who are involved directly in their affairs ? the boards of trustees , the parent-teachers associations , , the room mothers , and all the others . Local control keeps alive continuous debate and the freedom to experiment . It insures a wholesome diversity in educational plans and practices . It helps to keep public education from becoming an instrument of stifling conformity and uniformity . Yet we have reached the point where the financing of education , as distinguished from its control , can no longer everywhere be taken care of entirely from local or even from state and local revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arithmetic . The key fact is that by law most schools must rely very largely for their support on property taxes . But property-tax revenues do not go up as the population and the community income and production go up . And the tax revenues which do rise in proportion ? the income and excise taxes ? have been , largely taken over by the state and federal governments . . . . Adequate financing of public education .. . is first of all a responsibility of local and state governments . . . . Yet some measure of assistance to public education from the federal purse has now become necessary , and this necessity will become increasingly acute in the next few years . Two centuries of American history and experience testify that this need for federal financial assistance can be met without the slightest degree of domination by the central government . No such domination followed Congress ' grant in 1785 of a section of every township in the federal domain for the maintenance of public schools . Nor has President Lincoln 's approval of the Land Grant College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rights has done great good . So has the Fulbright Fellowship Program . And there has been no accompanying federal domination . . . . In February , 1953 , just after he assumed office , President Eisenhower said : " Our school system demands some prompt , effective help . " Yet today , two and a half years later , nothing has been done . Instead of " prompt , effective help , " we await a conference on education , to be held at the White House . . . . It seems to me a pitifully inadequate excuse for years of doing absolutely nothing about America 's No. 1 domestic need ? schools and teachers . I do not mean to ignore the President 's recommendation to Congress last February . We need , he said , $7 billion worth of new schools . But to help get them , he recommended that Congress pass not a law but a miracle . For meeting this $7'billion need the President proposcd grants of $66 million a year for three years . This is 33 cents a year to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The President 's recommendation also included federal loans for school construction to be repaid with interest . But the proposed amount was sufficient to cover only one-seventh of the needs the President listed , and when the fine print was read it developed that even these loan provisions were so drawn that they could never be used . The chief education officers of 40 states have said that it would be of no help whatsoever in their states . And Congress has long since buried the President 's bill . What then should our federal school-financing policy and program be ? It should be to face , honestly and forthrightly , our educational shortages , to hold the states and local communities responsible for meeting all of these shortages they . Can , and then to allocate from the taxes we collect from ourselves whatever is necessary to do the rest of the job . The figures on the shortages are well known . Enrollment in primary and secondary schools increased as much in the school year just ended as it did in the entire 20 years between 1930 and 1950 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firetraps . Seven hundred thousand children are on a split session basis and get only half-day schooling . We are currently short at least 250 , Q00 classrooms - which is rooms for 7.5 million children . The shortage of teachers is in some ways even more ominous than the shortage of school rooms . It is generally agreed that we need 180,000 more teachers than are presently available . Yet only 70,000 qualified teachers enter the profession each year . Somehow we must double the number to meet this appalling situation . We must start , it seems to me , with immediate support of the proposals now before Congress for $400 million of federal funds each year for the next four years for school construction to be matched by state funds . The need for more teachers-145,000 new teachers a year -- also means more money , higher salaries to make teaching a more attractive profession and more funds for educating teachers . Careful calculations indicate that a federal grant to the states of approximately $50 million a year , if matched by an equal amount of new state funds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So much for the present . Over the longer run it may be best not to tie federal assistance to specific purposes , such as school construction , but rather to make unrestricted cash grants to the states on a per pupil basis . State governments would then have much greater flexibility to distribute these funds among local school districts for whatever purpose would most effectively ad ' vance education . In view of the financial difficulties of the states ; I also have misgivings about making federal grants to education permanently on a matching basis . But in any event , to insure that federal assistance is given only to those states which already make a proper effort to support public education , and to avoid the further risk that federal aid might result in relaxed state and local effort , some stated minimum local effort should be required as a condition of federal assistance . Moreover , in the interest of narrowing somewhat the present wide gap in educational opportunity among the children of the various states , it seems to me that there are cogent reasons of fairness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the least ability to finance education . Finally , I would suggest a modest program of national scholarships to promising candidates who upbn graduation would undertake to give some years to teaching . To encourage outstandingly competent teachers scholarships might also be awarded for special teacher training to graduate students , or for advanced work for already experienced teachers . I have suggested here what seem to me the outlines .. of our public educational system . ! Yet we all recognize that there is infinitely more to the problem than simply providing a classroom and a person with a teaching certificate for every 30 children between the ages of 5 and 17 . The larger challenge that we must meet together .. . is to prove that mass education can also be good education . Good school buildings are an asset -- but they are not the essence of good education . The real heart of good education remains , as always , good teaching . We must , if we want to improve the quality of education , attract into teaching and hold there a far larger number of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and performance , and opportunity afforded for advancement to a high level based on merit , as in other professions . And above all , teachers must be freed of the shackles of bigotry and anti-intellectualism , and the indignities of loyalty oaths and unwritten blue laws which no longer apply to other citizens . - It is another accepted requirement for improving educational quality , I think , that we be clearer as to the tasks and priorities of our schools . Today they are being asked to perform not only their traditional jobs but , more and more , functions traditionally recognized as the obligation of the family , the church , the employer , and other social institutions . Under pressure of this group or that , courses of study are becoming laden with activities whose educational value is at least subject to serious question . In a growing and changing society , the primary tasks of the school must also grow and change . But we must be clear that if we expect the schools to do too much , if we expect the teacher to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the results . If our educational purposes are unclear , if the curriculum is chaotic and cluttered with distractions , if the teaching staffs are overburdened with an indiscriminate array of responsibilities well beyond their reasonable capacity to carry , we must expect that our children will be educated for mediocrity instead of for something better . . . . It is our common concern that we recognize and that we resist the pressures to let mass education become education for mediocrity . The dangers of mass education seem to me as much our problem as are its necessities . We are well advised , I think , to take very seriously the admonition that education for all may come to mean real education for none . , ? sickness in the nation 's work torte idles more employees than lack of work ; ? and one of every 12 children born this year will at some , time need institutional care because of mental ' disorder ? unless new ways are ' found to combat diseases of the mind . - Yet if we have been shocked by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startling report that gives us the courage to know that there is something that can be done . We hear , hardly daring to believe yet knowing it is true , the story of the results , during an eight-year period , of new medical research and education : ? deaths from influenza were reduced between 1944 and 1952 by three-quarters ; ? those from appendicitis and acute rheumatic fever dropped two-thirds ; ? fatalities from syphilis , kidney disease , pneumonia and tuberculosis were cut in half ; ? the nation 's death rate ' has been reduced by more than nine percent , the average life expectancy increased five full , years . People are now awakened ? partly by the shock of learning the facts of our weakness , and partly by learning what can be accomplished ? to a willingness and a great enthusiastic desire to contribute fully toward this accomplishment . How ? What form is this help to take ? What is there for us , the people , to contribute to this essentially technical job ? Money ? Yes , of course . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there be a people 's program for their own health -- so that they may marshal the support which is needed , may indicate the broad outlines of the non-scientific aspects of a democratic health policy , and may be at least able to make fullest use of scientific advance in this field . One basic proposition in the developing public attitude is that methods must be worked out for making medical services better available to all who need it , and this without crippling cost to anyone . We are spending $15 billion a year for medical expenses . We are willing , if we have to , to pay more . But we want to make this expenditure as effective as possible , to realize the economy of preventive medicine , to assure the distribution of medical service on a basis of need for it , and to remove the haunting fear in so many American homes that if serious sickness strikes it will wipe out every cent of savings , perhaps cut off all earning power , and destroy life 's dignity even if life itself is spared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarter of a million people die each year " whom we have the knowledge and the skills to save . " We think it not right that a million American families will have to spend more than half their income this year for medical care , that there will be 500,000 cases of catastrophic accident or illness which will consume the entire family income , that 8 million American families are today in debt for medical care , and that 2 million of these had to borrow at high interest rates from personal finance companies to cover the cost of medical treatment . There is emerging impressive evidence of agreement that the most promising approach to this problem of distribution of medical service lies in the development of voluntary , private , prepayment health insurance programs . Indeed , three out of every five people in this country are now enrolled in some program of this type , although in very few casesis the coverage comprehensive and so far only a small percentage of total medical costs are taken care of this way . This principle of private health insurance seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical service . Prepayment encourages resort to preventive medicine , with resultant reduction in the amount of costly hospitalization . In their most effective form these plans bring , the ministrations of specialists to families who could not otherwise afford them . . But the application of this new principle is still at an experimental stage . . . . In half the states there are restrictive laws , passed in haste , which prevent responsible private groups of doctors and patients from working out the effective prepayment plans they consider best . It is recognized by the leaders of both political parties , that , some degree of government assistance in developing this new program is necessary . The proposal to meet this situation by offering federal reinsurance to voluntary health plans has already been rejected on all sides as only ? a gesture . Reducing the uncertainties of insurer 's risks may help a little , but it does n't really approach the central problems of raising the money to get these programs started and then covering into them the low income and older people who are most in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , are the proposals to make long-term , low-interest-rate loans to new prepayment groups and to subsidize part of the cost of comprehensive service to groups including some whose financial means are limited but whose medical needs are no less great . Another point ' of now very general public agreement is that we need a good many more doctors and dentists and nurses , and a substantially larger . medical plant ? more hospitals and more or larger medical schools . There were , we are told , fewer medical school graduates in 1950 than in 1905 , and there are fewer doctors today in proportion to the population than there were a hundred years ago . Small wonder we are also told , that we need at least 25,000 more doctors . . . . New medical school construction which will cost a quarter of a billion dollars is needed , and there is the further formidable problem that it costs four times as much to educate a medical student as he can be expected to pay in tuition . The US Senate expressed unmistakably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bill to assist medical schools . The American Medical Association opposed that bill and it died in a House of Representatives Committee . The expressed concern was about federal domination . But research in these schools has been subsidized by many millions of dollars of federal grants without a hint or whisper of domination . And for my part I do n't believe government has any desire.or intention to dominate medical education , . and I think most all of us have complete confidence in the profession 's development of an educational program . We are ready to do almost anything we are asked in order to get the doctors we need . Finally , there is a powerful emergent demand today for an acceleration of the medical research program . And here again , in spite of all that has been accomplished , we are shocked by the uncompromising figures : ? that with 10 million American men and women suffering from heart disease we are spending $16 million a year on research in this field ? or $1.60 for each person presently afflicted ; ? that with cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim , we are spending this year , to solve that cruel mystery , only $25 million-15 apiece ; ? that with mental illness costing incalculable suffering , and almost $1.5 billion a year , we are spending $11 million , less than one percent of that cost to combat it ; ? that we are investing this year about a penny a person for research on arthritis and rheumatic diseases ? cripplers of 10 million Americans . It seems a little strange that the Department of Agri- , culture will spend this year for research on plant and animal diseases $10 million more than the Public Health Service is spending for research on cancer , arthritis , mental illness , neurological and heart disease combined . ?

There will be two million more Americans a year from now , 15-million more by the end of this decade . To cover the swelling ranks of the unemployed and insure that the workers who will be added to our labor force can find work we must have three million more jobs immediately , and then more and more until by 1960 some seven million new jobs have been added . . .

This kind of program will mean , on the other side of capitalism 's basic equation , as much increase in our power to buy as in our power to produce . There will have to be a substantial increase in the average annual earnings of employees in manufacturing industries . We will have to think in terms of a marked increase in our basic family income .

Any other incentive will be ineffective when there are weakening markets and idle factories . The function of democratic capitalism is not just making things ; the system works only as it gets the things it makes into the lives of people who can use them . So my own belief is that in the present situation the emphasis should be on encouraging consumption . The tariff issue , too , presents the question of whether we are going to recognize or ignore the role of buying power in a healthy economy .

In much of the free world , land reform and tenure by the many instead of the few is a major goal . Let us not go in the opposite direction in the United States and plow under the family farmer . Our objective for agriculture is equality with the other parts of our economy . Our yardstick for measuring this equality is parity ? a formula for fairness based on relating what a farmer gets for what he sells to what he must pay for what he buys . And 90 percent of what is fair is certainly not unfair or too high . Support by government loans at 90 percent of parity for basic commodities is all the more necessary at the present time when farmers ' income is falling and we are moving further away from the goal of equality . . , But such price supports do not by themselves constitute a complete farm program .
