Not in decades have Manhattan muse um-and gallery-goers witnessed such a heaping helping of British art as is spread out before them this season . The main course , in the Manhattan Museum of Modern Art 's " Masters of British Paint ing " show , is a 150-year survey of 31 artists ( see color pages ) , ranging from the visions of William Blake to the hallucinatory portraits of Francis Bacon , from the landscapes of Turner and Constable to the cool , elegant abstractions of Ben Nicholson and Stanley Spencer 's portrayal of a New Jerusalem near his green and pleasant home town of Cookham ( TIME . Nov. 21 ) . <P> <P> Backing up the Modern 's show , later to move on to St. Louis and San Francisco , is an exhibit of twelve contemporary British painters and sculptors rounded up by <P> Manhattan 's E. and A. Silberman Gal leries , slated for round-the-country museum showings , and a whole parade of one-man and group shows in the galleries . Says Manhattan Gallery Owner Catherine Viviano : " There are great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive than have been seen in years . " <P> Four for One . Behind the upsurge of interest in British painting is the impressive British performance in recent major international exhibitions . Side by side with the painters is a whole new group of promising sculptors , e.g. , Venice Prizewinner Lynn Chadwick . who have followed the pioneering of Britain 's one unquestioned artist of world stature , Henry Moore . <P> As a result , the British revival , which has spread back to 19th century painting and produced a record $56,000 for a Turner seascape and $30,000 for a Constable in a Manhattan auction last month , has once again made contemporary British art a much-sought-after prize . Manhattan 's Galerie Chalette. currently showing eleven British sculptors , has to date sold 19 pieces . Another Manhattan art dealer , who has already plunged heavily in British painting , confidently predicts : " An investment of $100,000 today in good British art will bring $400,000 in four years .

The birthright of British artists , as their Manhattan showing makes clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 18th century , Hogarth not only set down with unerring eye the look of crowded London coffeehouses , but portrayed the dissolute Englishman of his day with a skill and fervor far beyond mere pamphleteering and caricature . The talent Gainsborough showed for catching the majesty of England 's landscape became Britain 's prime contribution to painting in the hands of his successors : John Constable , who lavished the same care on cloud formations that Italian Renaissance masters gave the nude , and Joseph Mallord William Turner , who analyzed the tricks of light and atmosphere to produce a new , revolutionary art a whole generation ahead of the French impressionists . <P> Among the modern followers of that tradition , Welsh-born Augustus John gives his portraits of the great a romantic dash and bravura air that raises them far above the cliche level of most Royal Academy official portraits . Dublin-born Francis Bacon with his eerie studies has introduced into portraiture the element of overpowering psychological shock that leaves an echo in the mind like a scream in an empty corridor , and has made Bacon one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
