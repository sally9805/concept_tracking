One of man 's vicarious pleasures is reading other people 's mail . In Chicago last week , the antitrust suit involving Du Pont and General Motors provided the Government with an opportunity to air confidential letters dating back 30 years and more . No matter what the letters proved or disproved about the Government 's charge that Du Font 's control of G.M. restricts competition , there was no doubt that they were fascinating footnotes to the growth of Du Pont . <P> In 1921 , Lammot du Pont wrote his brother Pierre listing as " O.K. " those G.M. units which were buying 100% of their paint , Fabrikoid ( artificial leather ) and Pyralin ( plastic windows for side curtains ) from Du Pont . Those who were not buying 100% were either classified under " good reason " or " no reason . " Lammot added that Du Font 's sales department " would n't mind seeing things going a little faster . " <P> However , another exchange in 1922 showed that when Du Pont had a big chance to exercise a monopoly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its perfection of Duco , the quick-drying , auto-body finish which revolutionized painting in the industry . Before Duco , Body Builder Lawrence P. Fisher testified at the trial , it took 21 days to paint and dry a Cadillac . " If we had carried on with paint , " said Fisher , so much storage space would have been needed that " we 'd have had a roof over Michigan . " Had Du Pont limited the sale of Duco to G.M. , that company might have run away with the auto market . But Pierre du Pont wrote Irenee du Pont in 1922 that while this step had been considered , it was vetoed ; it might " entrench competition " ( i.e. , tie auto companies too close to suppliers ) later on when others developed quick-drying finishes , thus cut Du Font 's chances of selling outside G.M. <P> Moreover , despite Du Font 's desire to boost its sales to G.M. , a G.M. subsidiary could cut off its buying from a Du Pont subsidiary . In 1934 , G.M. 's Vice President John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had complained because New Departure stopped buying ammonia from Du Font 's National Ammonia Co . New Departure wrote back it did not even know National Ammonia belonged to Du Pont , but doubted it would make any difference ; their ammonia had been dropped because it had water in it . <P> In 1945 , Vice President Pratt had also suggested that General of the Army George C. Marshall should be elected to G.M. 's board on his retirement . G.M. 's Chairman Alfred P. Sloan passed the idea on to Du Font 's Chairman Lammot du Pont saying that Marshall ( then 65 ) was probably too old but that he " might do us some good . " Lammot du Pont rejected the idea : " My reasons for not favoring Marshall 's membership on the board are : first , his age ; second , his lack of stockholdings ; and third , his lack of experience in industrial business affairs .
