Are the Spirit and the Flesh one and the same thing ? Or are they separate entities , dependent and at the same time independent of each other ? Perhaps some great Cosmic Law holds this secret . But the one Universal Element that we can depend upon , apparently , is The Lucky Accident. cogito , ergo sum by ... John Foster West A warped instant in Space  --  and two egos are separated from their bodies and lost in a lonely abyss . I think , therefore I am . That was the first thought I had . Of course not in the same symbols , but with the same meaning . I awakened , or came alive , or came into existence suddenly , at least my mental consciousness did . " Here am I , " I thought , " but what am I , why am I , where am I ? " I had nothing to work with except pure reason . I was there because I was not somewhere else . I was certain I was there and that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me  --  no , I reasoned about me . I was surrounded by nothingness , by black nothingness , a vacuum . Immense distances away I could detect light ; or rather , I could perceive waves of force passing around me which originated at points vast distances away , vast in relation to my position in the nothingness . There were waves of force all about me , varying in frequency . The nothingness was alive with waves of force , traveling parallel and tangential to each other without seeming to interfere one with another . I measured them , differentiated between them and finished with the task in a matter of seconds . How could I do it ? It was one of the capabilities I was created with . What was I ? I perceived the waves of force . I perceived great quantities of mass  --  solid , liquid , gas  --  whirling in vacuum , mass built up out of patterns of basic force . I searched my own being , analyzed myself . I was not gas . I was not solid . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could reason . I was a beginning , a sudden beginning . And I had duration because I knew that time had elapsed since the moment I awakened though I had no means of telling how much time or of even naming the period . * * * * * Could I really be pure reason ? Can reason exist ? Can rational entity exist without a groundwork of matter , or at least of force ? It could . It must . I was rational entity and I existed . Yet I could find nothing of force , nothing to occupy space about my self . For all I could ascertain , I might have covered a one-dimensional point in eternity or I might have been spread throughout vast distances . From this reasoning I concluded that rational entity might occur either as some force unlike that of all natural phenomena in space , or as some combination of these forces at the moment beyond my own power to analyze , even detect . I finished with that for the time being . How did I come into being ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I before that instant I suddenly reasoned cogito , ergo sum ? I could not say . How did I know I even existed , really ? Obviously because I was capable of rational thought . But what was thinking ? First it was perceiving and accepting my own existence ; beyond that , it was recognizing the dark nothingness around me and the forces it contained . I had to exist . But how did I know nothingness was right ? And how did I know its darkness was right ? And how did I know the waves of force were waves and force ? And how did I know matter was matter and that I was none of these ? " Symbols , " I reasoned . " I 'm thinking in symbols . I could not reason without symbols ; therefore I could not exist as I am without symbols to think with . " Yet whose symbols were they ? Where and how did I come by them ? I could think back clearly to the instant of my creation , yet I had not invented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they been given to me . What then ? They were part of me when I came alive in this universe , had been invented some other time and elsewhere by someone else or by what I was before I became the entity of reason I now was . Then that first flash of perception in nothingness was not spontaneous . There was something behind it . I was something before that moment , in another era of time , perhaps a creature of substance . But what ? I concentrated . I remembered the symbol Marl . I was or had been an entity Marl . Were there others back there , somewhere ? There must have been , must be yet . Was I the only Marl who metamorphosed into this state of rational entity ? Surely not . Yet I could contact no other rationale around me as far away as I could probe . How far was that ? How could I know . Was it far enough to reach the other Marls , or were they scattered thinly throughout infinity around me like the flecks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to me as the proper description of my malady . I grew dizzy with my sickness . I wished to regurgitate , to cast off this cold , frightening sensation . Yet I was provided with no physical means of doing it . It filled me throughout all my thinking . It was I. I thought to exist . I thought depression , sickness . Therefore I was the malady and it was a hell of malcontent beyond symbolical description . What was wrong with me ? I was frightened . I was concerned for my existence here alone . What was it called ? The idea shimmered there on the fringe of perception , then fairly leaped into my consciousness . Existing alone as pure reason was worse than no-existence , was worse than dying or never having been at all . I need another Marl . To exist happily , I must have at least one other Marl to communicate with , to share my thoughts , to share my being . Is this a necessity , a condition peculiar to me as I am , as reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier with me from that other state ? It must be the latter . An entity of pure reason , having come into existence as reason , would need nothing but himself . Why ? Because he would be without emotion . " I am emotional , " I thought . " I am entity of almost pure reason , but I have inherited emotion from my previous state . It is a disorder of thought , but it can be a pleasant disorder when the emotion is the right one ; or , if unpleasant , when satisfied . " But I could not have emotions as I am now . They are cortical responses , or are supposed to be . What is cortical ? No , they are a sort of illogical reasoning , nothing physical  --  " The rest eluded me . " I am lonely , " I thought . " Loneliness stems from fear and fear is a basic emotion . I am very lonely . I have been lonely for a long time , bringing it with me here . I would rather sate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is to know . What can quell my loneliness ? Another like me , another Marl  --  whatever a Marl is . I must have , must find another Marl . " I began to search . I darted frantically about space like a frightened thing , though I could perceive no movement . I knew I passed from one area of space to another because I could measure slight changes in the position of the stars about me . I knew the points of light were stars . There was duration . I could not know how much . Eternity ? A split second ? But at last I discovered another like me . No , almost like me , but another Marl . The other entity had less of reason , more emotion . It was frightened and lonely . The Marl 's whole existence was that of sickness  --  of loneliness , which is fear . The Marl was darting about madly , seeking , seeking a thing like itself . What was it , like me but different ? As I came in , I measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or almost so . Emotionally we were different , vastly different . " Marls appear to exist as rationale and emotion , " I reasoned . " Beyond that I can not go . " The other Marl perceived me , darted frantically toward me , then slowed . We came together , touched like  --  like two cautious fish meeting in a dark pool and touching mouths to substantiate identical species . The other Marl was satisfied with my identity . It leaped frantically at me , raced around me , through me , finally stopped , pervading me , while vibrating in sheer relief and happiness . I felt the great fear-loneliness in the other Marl begin to recede and in its place came an almost overpowering euphoria . It was contentment , and it stemmed from the basic emotion love . I knew this at once . I suddenly realized that I too was relieved , that I was no longer sick with fear-loneliness . It was good , this existing of the other within me or simultaneously with me . Or was it I within the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a love-euphoria . " I am happy I found you , " I communicated . " I was lonely for another Marl . You are a Marl ? " The other hesitated , thinking . " No . I am Pat . I am different from you . But it is chiefly emotional . It is good . " " You are a Pat , " I returned in disappointment . " I had hoped to find another Marl . " " Do n't be disappointed , " the Pat soothed . " We are alike , really . Almost so . Like  --  like flame and gas are both substance yet different . We are two types of the same thing . I am no longer frightened . I am no longer lonely . You are good for me . " I was relieved because I wanted to be . I believed the other Marl  --  no , the Pat  --  because I wanted to believe . I did not bother to rationalize . I felt elation . " Then in that other time , that other place we both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ? " I suggested . " I believe so , " the Pat answered . " How was it when you came awake ? " I asked . " Can you remember ? " " I think so . I recall I was born here in fright because it was all wrong . I was not in my natural state , so it was not right . " The Pat paused to think . " I remember there was great speed and I was born in fright . Were you ? " " No , " I answered . " I was not frightened at first . And I was never frightened to the degree you were . I was mostly lonely , which is related to fear . But when I first conceived of my existence here I was coolly logical . I awakened reasoning  --  realizing that I existed . " " I suppose it has to do with our emotional differences , " the Pat beside me or with me or within me communicated . " Do you recall where in space you came from ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence at first so intensely I did not observe . You seem to have taken your own being for granted , thus you were , perhaps , more observant . " " I  --  I think so . " The Pat hesitated and I knew it was observing the stars around us . " Yes . Come with me . I think I know where . " I stayed with the Pat , a part of it , and we lurched through space . Rather , we ceased to exist at one point in space and existed in another . How far ? Distances meant nothing . " It was here , " the Pat informed me finally . * * * * * Something was wrong here . The interweaving waves of force were all wrong . There was a disorder , a great cancer in space . The waves interfered with the progress of each other all along a great barrier . It was not natural , not like it was elsewhere . " Something is wrong with the waves of force crossing this area . They interfere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detect it ? " I communicated . " I feel it , " the Pat answered . " It is a sickness in space like  --  like our loneliness . " I knew the comparison was ridiculous but I let it pass . " You said you came alive at great speed . I could have been traveling too . We must have plunged into this barrier . It seems to me that emotions must originate in a physical being ; perhaps reason could be free , but not emotion . I do n't know . But I have a theory . I believe our physical selves still exist somewhere in space . The barrier , perhaps , interfered with the normal functioning of our mental equipment . We exist at one point in space and we are thinking , experiencing emotions at another point . It 's as if our minds are  --  are broadcasting our thoughts and emotions far away from our physical selves . Either that , or our rationales were torn free and only our emotions are broadcast . Does that sound logical ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the answer . " I felt that the Pat was pleased with my theory , that it greatly admired my reasoning . I also perceived that it had no idea what I meant by the explanation . I did not mind . " You said you were moving at great speed , " I continued . " Can you remember the line , the direction you were traveling in ? " The Pat hesitated only a moment . " Yes . You perceive the star cluster there , the triangular one ? My heading was in that direction , but it was changing fast . " " Then we could find nothing by traveling toward the triangular cluster ? " " No . I was moving in an arc in the direction of the distorted square cluster there . Do you see it ? " " Yes , " I answered , knowing her use of the word see was unconscious . " That is Cetus . " " Cetus ? " The Pat was startled . " How do you know that ? " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call it that . " " It  --  it 's all so frightening ! " I had no time for pampering our emotions , though I was at great peace with the Pat so near me . Time might prove vital . " Neither would it do any good to travel in the direction of Cetus , " I said . " No . No , " the Pat communicated . " If there is any object of matter or force I was a part of in that other existence traveling through space , it is in an arc . The best we can do is take an arbitrary direction between the triangular cluster and the one called Cetus and hope to intercept the object , the other part of me , whatever it is . " " Come with me , " I ordered . I discovered the object of mass hurtling through space before the Pat did . It was symmetrical and metallic . I tore myself away from my companion and darted to meet it . I discovered it was a shell , a hollow thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were projections and circles of transparent matter . I experienced the symbol dials . There were two other creatures seated close to the dials , things of matter , and their substance was protoplasm . But there was no rationale present in either of them . I examined the living matter of the smaller one swiftly . Organs seemed poised in a suspended state . The creature I observed , housed in a protective shell , seemed paralyzed or dead . I remembered the word dead . Then the Pat was with me again . " I  --  I feel something , Marl . I am frightened . What are they , those things there ? " " They seem to be  --  " I stopped communicating . The Pat had disappeared ! The thing of protoplasm nearest me was moving but I was no longer interested . I remember the Pat had touched the upper extremity of the creature and had vanished , had ceased to be . The old sickness was back . I was lonely . I wanted the other entity . I could not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darted frantically about the metal shell , here and there , searching , searching . Where was the Pat ? I screamed for it . I thought Pat as far away as I could reach , but there was no reaction , no response at all . In my frenzy , I was back beside the creatures of protoplasm before I realized it , near the one I had not yet examined . " Perhaps they took her , " I thought . It was not logical , but it was a hope . Hope is emotional ; I was becoming more emotional than rational . I touched the larger of the two creatures , experimentally ; moved cautiously inside it , searching , searching . Suddenly I was seized by a great force , an inexorable power that grasped me and wrenched me , tearing me from the point in space I had occupied a moment before . My perception blurred , but I was not frightened . Without the Pat I did not care what happened . I was intensely curious . " So this is how it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease to be . " And I ceased to be .... * * * * * Marlow shook his head . I must have dozed , he thought . He glanced at the chronometer on the console ahead . No , only a minute or two had elapsed since the last time he had checked . " Sleepy head ! Wake up and live ! " He looked to his right . Pat sat in the navigator 's seat smiling at him . " I did n't sleep , honestly , " he protested . " We hit some sort of barrier back there . It knocked me out for a moment . I had the damnedest impression  --  " " Remember what you promised ! " She swiveled the seat about to face him . " No more scientific lectures on the mysteries of space or I 'll return to earth . You know my poor brain ca n't absorb it . " " You win , " he grinned , running calloused fingers through his greying crew-cut . He leaned forward and kissed her briefly . " How did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride in the first place ? " They laughed together , and he felt secure within the metallic shell surrounding them , no longer alone .
