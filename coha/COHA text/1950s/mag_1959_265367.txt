Shortly past midnight a group of about eight or ten dark figures darted through the moonlight toward the Poplarville , Miss . courthouse . Opening a window , they slipped into the sheriff 's office . They seemed to know that the jailer had gone for the night . They knew , too , that the cell keys were in a metal cabinet in the sheriff 's office . Some of the raiders waited in the darkened second-floor courtroom , while a few others , wearing gloves and masks , pushed their way through the courtroom into the cell area just above . A voice barked and startled Prisoner C.J. Monday : " Boy , where is M.C. Parker ? " Monday yelled to his jailmate : " Better get up , M.C. " <P> " Help Me ! " Mack Charles Parker , 23 , a truck driver scheduled to go on trial in a few days for the rape of a 24-year-old white woman last February , leaped from his bunk , pulled on his pants , made for the shower . For a moment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and rushed in . " Get him ! Get him ! " one man snarled . They swarmed all over him . <P> " I did n't do it , " Parker screamed . " I did n't do it ! Monday ! Do n't let ' em do me like this ! Help me ! " <P> One of the intruders began bludgeoning Parker with a pistol , another with a stick . A third picked up a garbage can and hit him . Parker went down , bleeding . " I did n't do it ! " he cried again . " Well , who did ? " demanded a man . Wildly , furiously , Parker pointed at his fellow prisoners : " He did it ! " The raiders began dragging him toward the stairs . One of them turned to the other five frightened prisoners and warned : " Keep your damn mouths shut ! " Parker wailed : " Do n't take me out ! Do n't let them kill me ! " <P> Down the concrete steps they dragged him , feet first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Parker pleaded in vain : " I 'll walk if you all do n't drag me ! " Blood trailed the figures as they stumbled onward , and a bloody handprint was slapped on the doorstep . The other prisoners ran to the window , saw the men fling their victim into a car , watched as the car and four or five other autos drove off . Parker 's terror-choked voice was drowned by the chatter of youngsters leaving a dance down the street . <P> The Hunt . But one outsider heard the commotion . A nurse in a hospital , some 200 ft. from the jail , telephoned the town marshal , who called Sheriff W. Osborne Moody . Quickly Moody called his deputies , alerted the highway patrol , the city police . Soon a huge posse fanned out from Poplarville into the countryside of heavy woods crisscrossed with streams . Within a few hours , Mississippi 's Governor James P. Coleman called in the FBI . <P> Proud of his record of law and order , Coleman declared fervently that he " never expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mississippi . It was , said he , " the first such incident in 20 years . "
