Featherbedding v. an Honest Day 's Work <P> IN a shack in the railroad yards at Antigo , Wis. last week sat four railroadmen : a fireman , a conductor , a brakeman and a flagman . All together , they collect pay totaling $110 a day , not counting fringe benefits . Their job : doing nothing . Earlier this year , the Chicago &; North Western Railroad decided to eliminate one of the two switching locomotives at Antigo because there was not enough work to keep them busy . But the road may not remove the idled crew without union permission , and permission had not been given . <P> Such practices make railroads the most egregiously featherbedded industry in the U.S. Not all examples are so flagrant , but the railroads declare that featherbedding costs them $500 million a year . Now , in the middle of negotiating new contracts , the roads have served notice that they intend to replace the feathers with some spine-stiffening substitutes - at the risk of a strike . <P> The railroads ' chief case is against their 40,000 firemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diesels . The roads argue that taking some 23,000 firemen off freight runs and yards alone would save them $200 million a year . They also want to change the mileage pay rates set 40 years ago when trains traveled at turtle speed . Under the obsolete rules , a train crew gets a full day 's pay for every 100 miles traveled , and conductors and trainmen on passenger trains for every 150 miles-even though the actual traveling time sometimes takes less than two hours . Under the same set of rules , the 20th Century Limited , between New York and Chicago , must have eight engine-crew changes on a 16-hour trip , forcing the New York Central to pay out a total of 19.2 days ' pay to 16 men . Some yard crews get a day 's pay for moving a train 100 yds . <P> <P> RAILROAD operators say they have had enough . " The necessity of employing firemen on freight and yard diesels costs the New Haven over $3,500,000 a year , " says George Alpert , president of the New Haven Railroad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bidez , vice president of the Central of Georgia Railroad : " In 1958 we paid firemen on freight and switch engines $1,005,000 . Considering the fact that we could get along without most of them , that 's a good bit of money . It 's 50% of the net earned last year . " The Great Northern Railroad reports that it paid $21 million for time not worked in 1958.
