For several years , there has been no more uncomfortable seat in baseball than the one currently occupied by Michael Franklin Higgins , a large , blue-eyed Texan who sometimes answers to the incongruous nickname of Pinky . Manager since last fall of the Boston Red Sox , Higgins is the fifth man in nine years to tackle the touchy job . The betting is that he will keep it for a long time . // Ever since Joe Cronin escaped in 1947 from the bench to the front office , where the brickbats land with a thud instead of a crash , the Red Sox managers have lived a life of triple jeopardy . Saddled by what are generally conceded to be the worst press relations in the league , they have had to face , usually alone , one of the most prolific , exacting and competitive presses in the land . But if they have had troubles from these sources , they are as nothing compared with the going over they have had from the rabid , baseball-wise following of a million self-appointed assistant managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did often in those trying years  --  the fans exploded with a clatter that suggested time bombs had been thoughtfully provided by the management under each seat . And the wrath of the fans landed with a loud , resounding smack on the head of the man who at the moment was thoughtless enough to answer to the name of manager . The trick was not so much to manage . It was to survive . // Why Pinky Higgins should want the job , much less think he could succeed at it , is still somewhat of a mystery among sound baseball men . Yet the fact remains that for the past eight years the low-pressure Irish Methodist has surely and steadily stalked his way to Fenway Park . // When he quit as a major league player after the 1946 World Series , Higgins could have become manager of the Class AAA Toronto club of the International League . He turned the chance down in favor of the same job with Roanoke in the Class B Piedmont League . The difference was that Roanoke was in the Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working agreement with Toronto . " At Toronto I would have had only two or three Red Sox men , " Higgins commented recently . " At Roanoke I had a whole ball club of ' em . " // Higgins has had whole ball clubs of Red Sox ever since . But there was a time last fall when it seemed as if all the training might go for naught . He had just finished his most successful season , winning the Little World Series with the Louisville Colonels of the American Association , when he was offered the managership of the Philadelphia Phillies . Higgins told the Boston management about it , and they decided to pay off Lou Boudreau , whose contract as manager still had a year to run . Boston was n't allowing Higgins to escape . // JUMP FOR GENIUS // This week , as the Red Sox continue to show surprising strength in chasing the American League pennant , the Boston management 's quick decision to grab hold of Higgins has the aura of genius about it . Boston 's brain trust could look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of tailspin it suffered beginning in the second month of the season , when nothing Higgins did went right . The return of Ted Williams is credited with adding much of the lift , and undoubtedly his presence in the lineup has been a boost to morale . But other Boston managers have foundered with Williams on the roster . Those who are counting on Higgins to keep the team in high fettle are depending rather on qualities not often sought after nor found in a new manager : sound knowledge of his players and their wholehearted respect . Of the 44 men who were on the roster at spring training headquarters in Sarasota , Fla. this March , 23 had played for Higgins somewhere along the line and all 23 swore by him . // What it is exactly that Higgins has is hard to lay a finger on . Patient , colorless , plain , slow of speech and manner and action , he is a living bromide , the still water that runs deep , the honesty that is the best policy , the virtue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , unspectacular man , rugged and simple and given to uttering such homely phrases as " Rules are made to be broken " and " A happy team is a winning team . " // Even these phrases do not come readily . Higgins speaks in a deep drawl and his voice is so low that a visitor has to pay close attention to catch everything . He rarely answers a question without turning it over for inspection several times first . Sometimes he ponders so long that he appears to have forgotten the question . His easy ways give him the disarming manner of a country boy and strangers often mistake him for a ready mark in the big city . But they soon discover that underneath he is as shrewd as a banker and a sharp man in a corner . // In one sense Higgins is fortunate in taking over the Red Sox this year . The many woes that once beset his worthy predecessors have for the most part vanished . The press , and even at times the public , chastened by the near-certain knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repatriation of the Braves in Milwaukee , are acting with a restraint that proper Bostonians should find comforting . // Many other things are different . The policy of buying up established stars and installing at their head a manager who had recently won a pennant was buried under an avalanche of raw youths brought in two years ago by Boudreau when he combed Red Sox farms for new talent . Boudreau 's players are maturing . // So is Williams . A national hero today , Ted was always something of a problem child in earlier days . Charming one minute and glumly uncooperative the next , Williams was bigger than any manager  --  a law unto himself . He did as he pleased , and no manager dared try to cross him . Joe McCarthy , a martinet when he won eight pennants with the New York Yankees , was willing to forego one of his strictest regulations in Boston . A stickler for formality in dress , he appeared without a necktie on his first day of spring training in Florida so that Williams , who flatly refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve O'Neill treated Williams with stout deference , and Boudreau and Williams maintained a mutual silence . The long shadow of the great slugger was always darkening the manager 's door . // Not so Pinky Higgins . He and Williams have been friends since 1946 , when both were on the only Boston team ever to bring a pennant home to millionaire Owner Tom Yawkey . When Higgins was appointed manager , Williams was quoted as saying , " Mike is a nice guy , " a grudging compliment from anybody else perhaps , but from Williams , who is not given to paying unsolicited tributes , high praise . // Throughout the spring , when rumors over Williams ' intentions were meeting each other coming and going , Higgins maintained an attitude of impassive indifference . The slugger had announced his retirement at the beginning of the 1954 season , but few believed that he meant it , and almost everyone but Higgins had an opinion on the subject . // THE WILLIAMS ENIGMA // " I 'd like to have him , " Higgins said , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't heard a thing . In the meantime , Throneberry 's my left fielder . He 'll do all right . " // Faye Throneberry , a taciturn 24-year-old youth fresh out of the Army and happy to be a big league ballplayer , is typical of the new Red Sox . He and his teammates of several years ' standing offer the last and possibly the sternest contrast with Red Sox teams of the past . In 1950 , the year after the club had missed winning two successive pennants on the very last day of the season , there were 11 Cadillacs in the players ' parking lot behind Fenway Park . Those Red Sox were big-businessmen ballplayers , not loafers , but not hungry men either . They could , with some equanimity , shrug off defeat as part of the game , then blithely drive their Cadillacs home to wait for the next season to roll around . // The current team is completely unspoiled . The men are lean , hungry , determined and eager , and their salaries are commensurate with salaries of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows of remembrance and the Cadillacs are confined mostly to a few players ' futures . // This is the kind of team Higgins wants . Indeed , it 's the team he virtually grew up with . There is the 23-year-old Tom Brewer , whose three-hit shut out over the Indians last Sunday is typical of the good ball Higgins is getting from his young men . There is the 22-year-old Gene Stephens who , when things were going badly for him in Boston in 1953 , said , " Send me back to Louisville with Mike . " There is 25-year-old Ike Delock , who made the same request at just about the same time . There are others who have asked to be sent back from Louisville to Birmingham " so I can be with Mike again , " just as boys in the Red Sox farm system seven years ago asked to be sent from Birmingham to Roanoke " with Mike . " // " Higgins is the greatest judge of human nature I have ever known , " says Charley Wagner , a Higgins teammate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Red Sox . " He knows instinctively how to get the most out of young ballplayers. " // Players like Al Curtis , George Susce , Pete Daley , Frank Malzone , Don Buddin , Marty Keough , Norm Zauchin and Al Van Alstyne , some of whom are with the Red Sox now and some of whom are on the way , can testify to that . So can veterans like Milt Boiling , who was with Higgins at Louisville , and Leo Kiely and Willard Nixon , who pitched for him at Birmingham . // The late Harry Agganis , for whom Higgins had high hopes as a player before he died as a result of pneumonia this summer , got typical Higgins treatment at Louisville in 1953 . Fresh out of Boston University , where he had been an outstanding football star , he got off to a terrific start , then suddenly went into a terrible nosedive . He suffered in silence for weeks , and finally went to Higgins with the plea , " Mike , what am I doing wrong ? " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled out of the slump . // Why did n't he tell him sooner ? // " An independent guy like Agganis would have resented me butting in , " Higgins explained . " He always figured he was man enough to solve his own problems . I wanted him to want help before I said anything . " // But when Gene Stephens ran into the same trouble at Louisville last year , Higgins began working with him right off . Stephens eventually got back into the groove , but it took him longer . // " You 'd go to a kid like Stephens , " Higgins said . " You could n't wait for him to come to you . He was scared and nervous and he needed confidence . You had to coax him into believing in himself . That takes time . " // In his playing days , Higgins was a steady , solid third baseman who occasionally hit spectacular heights . In 1938 , his second year with the Red Sox , he established a major league record of 12 straight hits which still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Higgins twice hit three home runs in one ball game , and he played on two American League All-Star teams and in two World Series during his 15-year career . He started with the Philadelphia Athletics , then went to the Red Sox , on to Detroit , and finally , in 1946 , back to the Red Sox . After winning the pennant that year , they lost the World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals . Higgins , then 37 , played through all seven games , being replaced only once , and that by a pinch-runner in the ninth inning of the first game . // Higgins was noted in his day for a peculiar batting stance , in which he stood stiff-armed , holding his bat high over the plate and almost perpendicular to the ground . His lifetime average of .292 was well ahead of that of the average third baseman . Generally known as a " ballplayer 's ballplayer , " he was a valuable team man , who could hit in the clutch and whose record did not quite do justice to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his offseason time now hunting and fishing , which he loves . He lives in Dallas during the winter with his attractive brunette wife , Hazen , and his two school-age daughters , Diane and Elizabeth , otherwise known as Bootsie . The rest of the year they rent a house in Newton , Mass. , not too far from the Fenway . The girls and their mother are all musical , a circumstance which Mike accepts with placid good nature . Sometimes , if the noise gets too loud , he quietly goes to his room and closes the door . // His name , a source of embarrassment to him for years , came from the fact that he had a rosy complexion as a small boy . A sister nicknamed him Pinky , and he carried it with him through school , college and the big leagues . Given his choice , he 'd prefer to be called Mike . // " I do n't suppose it makes a hell of a lot of difference , " he says , " because I 'm more interested in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , honestly now , do n't I look more like a Mike than a Pinky ? " // Before the season began , Higgins minced few words in showing more confidence in his young ball club than the baseball experts , many of whom picked the Red Sox to finish no better than fifth this year . He told reporters the club would definitely be in the thick of the pennant race . // " I would n't want to predict that we can win , " he said , " but I think we 'll take more games than last year 's team did . " Boudreau 's 1954 club won 69 games , finishing fourth , 42 games behind the league-leading Cleveland Indians . // At 46 , Higgins knows exactly what he wants and where he 's going . When he talks baseball , he expresses himself with quiet confidence . He punctuates his remarks with pithy phrases , along with the aforementioned maxims which he likes to assemble in simple battle array , the better to score his points . Here are some typical volleys : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the personnel . " // " Percentage baseball must be good . If it were n't , it would n't work so often . " // " It 's easy to see what a fellow is doing wrong . The big job is to make the proper corrections. " // " Each man must be treated as an individual . No two do things alike . " // " Every manager has his own way of dealing with problems . " // " I do n't consider handling ballplayers a problem . It 's a pleasure . " // " Discipline never reforms a bad actor . I 'd rather get rid of a man than fine or suspend him . " // " The golden rule is old , but it still works pretty well . " // The phrases may not make any notable additions to Bartlett 's Quotations . As exemplified by Pinky Higgins , however , they do apparently shape ball games .
