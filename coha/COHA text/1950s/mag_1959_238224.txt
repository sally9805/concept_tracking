The television industry seems to have the notion on occasion that it is a tribe of electronic Watusi. too tall to recognize anyone but giants . At award time each spring , the critics bow before Hope , proclaim faith in Dinah , show charity toward Sullivan . Last week the Peabody Awards committee changed TV scripture by singling out a cheery and engaging local show for one of its top awards . Shown only over Chicago 's independent WGN-TV ( Mon. , 7:30-8 p.m . ) , The Blue Fairy in little more than a year captured Chicago youngsters without a struggle ; now it has recognition as one of the top children 's programs of 1958 and the further distinction of being the only program on an independent station on the list . <P> The weekly fascination begins when one of the daintiest ( 5 ft. 3 in. , 87 Ibs. ) of fairies , 14-year-old Brigid Mary Bazlen , floats into view on elfin wings . Waiting for her . seated on imitation mushrooms in the Blue Forest , are half a dozen moppets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral ( letter writing is a good thing ) , and manages to keep her wings on even when things go a little wrong , as they did when one recent guest announced plainly : " I hate you . Blue Fairy . " <P> It is not a widely held opinion . Nor is the show merely a catchall collection of kids exercising their ids . The lords of the Blue Forest are really a remarkable group of puppets created by ex-Actor George Nell , 34. and Writer-Director Don Kane , 30 . As Hostess Brigid and her small guests sit by and offer advice , creatures named Tugnacious R. Jones and Myrtle Flower ( " She 's an Eloise type " ) join an old , nasal-voiced wizard in such projects as constructing a popcorn machine that will not stop popping , and making a sewing machine that turns out marbles . <P> If the show must admit kinship to Kukla , Fran and Ollie and Walt Disney , it is still the healthiest baby in the TV nursery . Brigid Bazlen claims no professional antecedents at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's father is dead ) , she began at the age of ten with a part in an ABC network soaper called Hawkins Falls , lasted 2 years before she was tapped for Puppeteer Nell 's show . A miracle of poise on camera , the Blue Fairy is still a refreshingly down-to-earth teen-ager offstage . Celebrating the Peabody with her mother at Chicago 's glossy Pump Room , Brigid downed two full dinners , including two bowls of whipped cream for dessert . The professional goodies are just starting . After the Peabody Award last week , the Blue Fairy is almost a sure bet for a network time slot soon .
