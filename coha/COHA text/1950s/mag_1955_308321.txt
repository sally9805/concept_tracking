( See Cover ) <P> On a bleak November day in 1952 , twelve men dressed in somber suits gathered in a waiting room in Coshocton , Ohio . They were members of the executive council of the American Federation of Labor , and they had just attended the funeral of 82-year-old William Green , their longtime chief . As the labor leaders waited for the train , Green 's successor , George Meany , bluntly announced that he had chosen William Schnitzler , of the Bakery Workers Union , to be secretary-treasurer of the federation . Old Dan Tobin , president emeritus of the Teamsters Union , objected angrily . But Meany was unshaken ; the election of Schnitzler , he said , would be held the next day in Washington . <P> The labor elders were flabbergasted . Never before , in all the 28 years of Bill Green , had they seen such rank insubordination on the part of the man they tolerated as their president . Meany had his way , and the following day Schnitzler was elected by a vote of 7-6 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Meany was boss as well as president of the A.F.L. He did not seek power for its own sake ; he had some aims in view . <P> Today Meany is within sight of his first goal ; barring unlikely accidents , the 10 million A.F.L. members and the 5,000,000 C.I.O. members will unite next fall , under Meany 's leadership , in the greatest free labor organization the world has ever seen . <P> In his first official act as president , Meany revived the dormant Labor Unity Committee , and for two years he worked ceaselessly toward a merger . This year at Miami he knew that the time was ripe . Meeting in February with five other top leaders , Meany told them it was then or-as far as he was concerned-never . C.I.O. and A.F.L. negotiators quickly ironed out their differences , signed the agreement to merge . <P> What this huge combined force will mean to the U.S. future can be glimpsed by looking at the circumstances and the men ( George Meany in particular ) responsible for labor 's reunion . <P> A Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. Lewis and the garment workers ' Sidney Hillman and David Dubinsky , the C.I.O. was formed in 1935 with two slogans : 1 ) " organizing the unorganized " and 2 ) doing it by setting up unions of industrial ( as opposed to craft ) scope . The C.I.O. took with it a high proportion of the brains and drive of the A.F.L. and about one-third of the membership . The C.I.O. 's great achievements : organization of the automobile workers and the steelworkers . Its great failure : the heavy infiltration of Communists into some of its unions and its own high councils . <P> Dubinsky and his International Ladies ' Garment Workers went back to the A.F.L. in 1940 , Lewis went back ( temporarily ) in 1946 , Hillman died the same year . Lewis ' able lieutenant , Philip Murray , held the C.I.O. together by the cohesive pull of his own shining integrity . It took him years to clean out the Communists , an effort that sapped much of the C.I.O. 's energy .
