THE ART OF LLEWELLYN JONES , by Paul Hyde Banner ( 372 pp. ; Scribner ; $4.50 ) , brings back the amateurish but pleasantly diverting ex-diplomat who specializes in novels ( S.P.Q.R. , Excelsior ! ) about the kind of foreign affairs that set ambassadorial medals ajingle . The latest hero to pop out of Author Bonner 's undiplomatic pouch is Townsend Britton , who is on the mossy side of 50 ; he is tall , athletic and handsome , but his soul bears the thumbprint of his ruthless wife Edith . She forces him to resign as U.S. Ambassador to Belgium because she wants to be a Washington hostess . Eventually , Britton decides that he , too , can be ruthless , and in fact , Edithless . Boldly following the urge that is the 27-year itch of many a marriage , he deposits $320,000 with discreet Swiss bankers , shaves off his mustache and his Harvard accent and , as plain old Llewellyn Jones , decamps . <P> He goes only as far as Cincinnati , but there he is at last free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ripe young secretary . But the most surprising development of this renaissance is artistic . A lifelong doodler , the AWOL diplomat tries a little weekend sketching and ( here we Gauguin ! ) is startled to find that he is an artist of astonishing power-a Rubens , perhaps , with a touch of Renoir . Within a year he is in Paris , painting his broad-hipped housemaid by day , panting for her by night . But the late-blooming bohemian 's idyl is broken by Edith , who shows up to buy a painting and promptly recognizes the lamster . Will he turn worm and let himself be stuffed back into a boiled shirt ? Not , the reader can bet his burnt sienna , until expatriate geniuses drink Pepsi-Cola instead of Pernod . For wives , the moral is clear : if a husband begins to doodle , draw your own conclusions . <P> <P> MAGGIE CASSIDY , by Jack Kerouac ( 189 pp. ; Avon ; 50 ) , is a sequel to Doctor Sax ( TIME , May 18 ) , the beat Boccaccio 's exuberant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughneck buddies from the time they pass puberty ( timidly , as if it were a haunted house at midnight ) beyond the point at which Duluoz leaves Lowell , Mass. , as Kerouac did , to play football for Columbia . Both books are written in the author 's customary form , which is to say , utter formlessness . But while the disjointed episodes of Doctor Sax added up-after a number of sizable subtractions-to a vivid picture of mill-town childhood , the gush of recollection in Maggie Cassidy soon becomes just one undammed thing after another .
