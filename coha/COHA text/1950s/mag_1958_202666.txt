Almost unnoticed , the U.S. has been negotiating to surrender five of its most important overseas airbases : the Strategic Air Command 's " frontline " B-47 fields ( and a naval air station ) in Morocco . Reason for the deal is twofold : 1 ) nationalist pressure in newly independent Morocco for withdrawal of all foreign forces , U.S. as well as French and Spanish ; 2 ) U.S. judgment that in the near future the Moroccan bomber fields will have lost their present strategic value . <P> Legally and politically , the U.S. has found itself in an awkward spot ever since the French granted Morocco independence in 1956 . Lacking any agreement with the new nation , the U.S. was forced to rest its case on the lease it had signed with the French government five years before . In fact , France still claims technical ownership of the bases , and the <P> French flag still flies over the gates . The rising opposition of young Moslem activists in Morocco found the U.S. bases a convenient weapon to use against King Mohammed V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried a Moroccan trade-union weekly . Egged on by extremists , the Moroccan government forbade U.S. ships to land gear , even set up roadblocks near the Atlantic coast in case U.S. ships should try sneak unloading of trailer trucks . <P> For Moroccans , it was a question of pride . What they wanted most was some evidence that the foreigner acknowledged their new status as a fully sovereign nation no longer an appendage of France . U.S. Ambassador Charles Yost made them an offer : the U.S. would evacuate the $500 million bases after seven years . The Moroccans countered with a request for a three-year phaseout . The expected compromise : U.S. operation of the bases for five more years .
