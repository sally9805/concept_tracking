In a suburb of Chicago last week , Grocer Marty Garofalo grossed $25,000 in his bustling , up-to-date supermarket . That was quite a way up from the $200-a-week business he was doing in a neighborhood store four years ago . The difference : Garofalo had become one of the 5,300 members of the Independent Grocers Alliance , a chain of owner-operated stores that , next to the A. &; P. , is the world 's biggest food-retailing organization . <P> Last week the chain 's President Donald Robert Grimes , 47 , announced plans to grow much bigger . By 1963 , he hopes to have 10,000 store members , doing an annual business of more than $5 billion , compared with a 1952 gross of $2.3 billion* ( and A. &; P. 's volume for the year ended last Feb. 28 of $3.8 billion ) . I.G.A . retailers are spending almost $9,000,000 this year on 125 new supermarkets and enlargement of existing stores . Next year , another $10 million will be invested in stores . <P> Weapon Against Chains . I.G.A . was conceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had captured 30% of the retail food market . J. ( for Joseph ) Frank Grimes , father of I.G.A . ' s president and a Chicago accountant who specialized in auditing the books of wholesale grocery firms , had been watching the new chains put independent retailers out of business . Why not , he asked , fight the chains with their own weapons : centralized purchasing and hard-hitting merchandising ? He signed up 75 stores to try his plan , and in the first year their volume went up 20% . <P> When Don Grimes , a graduate of the University of Illinois , who had served an apprenticeship as an A. &; P. store manager , joined I.G.A. , there were 748 stores . He worked his way through several jobs , became assistant to the president after a three-year Army hitch , president when his father retired last year . <P> O.S.S. for O.G.G.s . To get in step with the trend towards supermarkets , Don Grimes in 1946 set about making complete food markets of I.G.A . stores . Serving what he calls " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing in one place ) required " one-stop stores " and " onesource suppliers . " He got half of I.G.A . ' s wholesalers to provide uniform-quality meats by ordering directly from packers . He persuaded more than half of them to stock prepackaged fresh fruits and vegetables , started putting out I.G.A . labeled products . Example : two months ago , an I.G.A . wholesaler in Champaign , Ill. made a deal with a local dairy to supply milk with a special I.G.A . label . Such mass purchasing helped I.G.A . stores to cut the price of milk 2 a quart to 19 and still make a 2 profit . Milk sales increased 30% . <P> Thinking Big . I.G.A . stores , which have expanded into Canada , run all the way from small stores , which may gross as little as $50,000 a year , to the " Foodliner , " which grosses an average of $90,000 a week . To the central office , grocers pay $600,000 a year in dues ( $5.75 a month per store ) and special service fees .

Another $650,000 a year is paid to Food Brokers , Inc. , which furnishes wholesalers with I.G.A.-brand items ( accounting for 10% of store sales ) .
