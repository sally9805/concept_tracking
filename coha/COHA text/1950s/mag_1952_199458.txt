The Republican National Committee showed its bias in other ways than the contested-delegates fight . It picked an almost 100% pro-Taft group of convention officials ( TIME , June 23 ) , and it loaded the list of invited speakers with a high proportion of Taft partisans . <P> Elder Statesman Herbert Hoover and Elder Hero Douglas MacArthur were choices at which anti-Taft Republicans could not cavil , though MacArthur was for Taft . But the national committee made no effort to balance these choices by a list of speakers with more appeal to independent voters . <P> The national committee 's list carried the names of only two governors out of 25 G.O.P. governors now in office . The list of Senators was even more remarkable . Bridges of New Hampshire was an obvious choice , since he is the party leader in the Senate . But the other invited Senators , and by that fact certified as distinguished members of the party , were Kem of Missouri , Cain of Washington and McCarthy of Wisconsin . <P> Lackluster Senator Kem is strongly opposed to " foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is McCarthy . Millions of independent and convertible voters are looking at their television sets in search of Republicanism 's face . The national committee chose to present a face that was not the Republican Party as it is , but the Republican Party as the Democrats say it is.
