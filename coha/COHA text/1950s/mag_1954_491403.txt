cost more than 1 lull now just to have it let out enough at the seams . And I 'm Still traveling . My wife , Dolores , com  --  plains t hat I 'm always taking off for Alaska , London , Koren , Cleveland . Denver , or Washington , D.C. , without giving her warning . I 'll say this for Dolores : No one can handle being married to a traveling-salesman type better than she . She 's very sweet about my absences . In fact , the towels in our bath  --  room are marked lisits and Wre.t.costg TRAVELER . But when she gets a certain look in her eye , I take her on my next trip . Last year the Friars threw a testimonial dinner for me in New York . During the evening several tributes were paid to me as a show-business pro . It was nice to hear all that flattery . I was glad Dolores was there to hear it too . Up to then , she 'd thought I was a pilot for United Air Lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent a letter to a friend . In it he tried to explain me . " People are always asking me how Hope survives t he schedule he sets for himself , " he wrote . " He could n't survive without it . Applause , laughter and commendation are food and drink for him . There 's no tension felt when he walks on stage  --  not by him , anyhow . He expands , he mel  --  lows , he blooms , he beams . When he tells his first gag and the place falls apart . his life is complete . How can a fellow like that weaken physically ? I once talked him into a vacation and he never for  --  gave me . He had hives , shingles and a spastic colon when he returned . Never again , he vowed . " That phrase " not by him . anyhow " is , of course , sheer jealousy . But seriously , I ought to be jealous of Bing . He 's the luckiest man I know . Anything he touches turns to gold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand why my weakness for knocking myself out made him think me an inter  --  esting case for analysis . Bing would rather do any  --  thing than work . It 's a delight to he with that fat baritone in a film or in a radio show . He 's as smooth as oil from one of his collection of gushers . , But his idea of a perfect script would be one that opens with him looking through a knothole . The rest of the pic  --  ture would be what he sees through it . At that . Bing may be right about what keeps my motor turning . But the ugly problem staring me in the face right now is trying to remember my life for publication . Not that it does n't seem worth while . Ben Franklin and Giovanni Jacopo Casanova did it . and their stuff is still selling , is n't it ? I 'll never forget the first time I met Fred Allen . He was catching my act in a theater where I was playing . Afterward , when he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What did you think ? " Propping his eyebags open , he drawled , You rook with confidence , " Now that I 'm breath  --  ing down Franklin'a and Casanova 's necks , I could use , some of that reek . In the ' mat , I 've used the story of my life mainly as a springboard for launching gags . Once I 've used them , I tile t hem away in steel cabinets . When she ordered those filing cases , my secretary , Marjorie Hughes , specified " airtight . " It was either that or a chlorophyll spray . Here are a few samples : I lived in a very tough neighborhood . I 'll never forget thn morning I got the new wrist watch ... and the afternoon I got the new teeth . You could loll if a kid in 711 y block was a sissy . If he eouM n't light , ho did n't have any ears . I nIwnvs had mine . l mire them Lied behind my neck .

They studied me . Mark Twain might have envied that sort of thing , but something tells me that they 're not what this project calls for . I do n't say my mind is orderly . When I try to remember dates and names . I bang my forehead with my fists so hard I have to have my head reblocked . But I 've learned a thing from radio and TV shows . I do better if I warm up for them beforehand on stage , in front of the audience . That way , when I 'm on the air , I feel good out there . So I think shadow-box around with my memories be  --  fore I go into my **25;4389;TOOLONG  --  Jacopo routine . Once I get the hang of this deal , I ought to be able to knock it off in the ordinary , **27;4416;TOOLONG way . I 'll start with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people start . What a job she did with her seven rockhead sons . She was so great . One of the mem  --  ories that come back to me is her Saturday-night routine . She 'd get out a big washtub and give us baths in the kitchen , taking us in order of our conduct for the week . If we 'd been good , we got fresh water . That 's why I was tan ? at least beige  --  until I was thirteen . Nowadays when I walk into a luxury hotel and see all those gleaming bathroom fixtures , I remember that galvanized job in the kitchen and the soap in my eyes and mother duck  --  ing us . One of the great things about my mother was that she never stopped encouraging us . When I began to grow up and had theatrical ambitions , she took me to Keith 's 105th Street in Cleveland to see Frank Fay . Frank was vaudeville 's top monologist . He must have been getting $2000 to $2500 a week , which would be like getting two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and talked to the audience as casually as if they were old friends of his . After Frank had worked for a few minutes , mother looked at me and said loudly , " He 's not half as good SS you . " " Sh-h-h , " I said . " Ma ; please , mar ' " I do n't care , " she said . " He ca n't sing or dance . " Later in his act , Frank did both of those things , but she had n't given him a chance to do either . The peo  --  ple near us looked at us as if we were goofy . Mom looked hack at them defiantly and stared them down . Years later I had one of my biggest thrills when I came back to Cleveland and played that same theater . Mother was still alive then and was sitting out front . I knew she was saying to herself , Well , it 's about tune . They should have revognized hrs genius sooner . Another memory that limits into my head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once when I was in Chicago , I dropped in at a night spot , the Chez Pares , to catch Joe 's last show , 1 was too late for that , but I saw Dottie Lamour sitting at a table , and I sat beside her . A woman walked over to the table , took my chin in her hand , and turned my face toward another woman she 'd left hack at . her table . " This is it , Julie , " she said , handling my head as if it were a cabbage . Dottie and I laughed so hard we almost fell under the table . The woman did n't say " Pardon me . " She just walked over and used me for demonstration purposes . She 'd probably said to her friend . " There 's Bob Hope over there , " and her friend Raid , " 1 do n't believe it . " So she walked over , took my head and twirled it around a couple of times to prove her point . When I 'd pulled myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get your material , honey ? It 's great . " " I listen to you every Monday night , " she said . I stopped laughing . I 'd been on Tuesdays for four years . Taking the memories as they pop into my mind brings up my brief career as a pug  --  a career so con  --  densed it was engraved on a pin head . Mine . I took up pugilism because Whitey Jennings , my best pal in Cleveland , said to me in the Alhambra Poolroom , " I 'm going to tight in the Ohio state amateurs . " " Oh . yeah ? " I said jeeringly . He was serious . " No fooling , " he said . " 1 signed up today . " He showed me his entry card . It read : " Packy West fighting in the featherweight division . " Packy was an impressive name for a tighter to have in those days , since it had been used by an outstanding boxer of that era , Packy McFarland . Next day I went downtown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gang Whitey and I hung around with thought the name I 'd chosen was very whimsical . It was kind of a rib on Whitey 's lighting name . " That Hope kid , " they said , " he 's a curd . " I was sixteen and I weighed 128 pounds . The featherweight class had a top limit of 126. 1 just missed getting into it .

Everybody ought to have a spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whiteym.t he gang . But they could n't rind Whitey Jennings and I were always prospecting around for ways to raise pocket money . The richest pay streak we hit were the picnic foot races , We were pretty good runners . Very few kids our age could outfoot us . We combed through the papers to find out what organizations or industrial out  --  fits were having their picnics , and where . Sometimes there 'd he a picnic at Luna Park and another at Euclid Beach the same day . Since we could n't he at both places at once , we figured nut a way to lick the problem . If the grocers were having their picnic at Luna Park , we called up a member of the grocers-picnic committee and asked , " What time are you having your foot-racing events ? " The fellow might say , " Two-thirty . Why ? " " We 're from the Cleveland Press , " we 'd say . " We wanted to take some photos . But two-thirty is too late . " " What time would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he 'd ask . We 'd tell him , " If you put them on at two o'clock , we 'll send our camera  --  man out . " " Sure , " he 'd say . " Fine . Glad to have you . " Then we called the organization which was holding the competing pic  --  nic at Euclid Beach and arranged to have the races there postponed until three-thirty . When we arrived at Luna , the fellow in charge of the program would be waiting for the cameraman , but Whitey and I 'd pressure him into starting the races without a photog  --  rapher . " Let 's get them over , " we 'd say . " We want to go swimming . " So after a while he 'd say , " O.K. Let 's go . We ca n't wait for that photographer all day . " Next we 'd find out who was to start the races . Then we 'd ask him , " How ( 10 you do your starting ? " " How does anybody start races ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get set , go , of course . " When we 'd caught his rhythm and were familiar with the interval between his " get set " and his " go , " we started in that interval . In that way we could count on a two-yard lead . With such a start , Charlie Paddock could n't have caught us . In a college or AAU meet they 'd have called us back . Not at picnic . They did n't care . They were smoking fat cigars and drinking beer , Nobody was technical . ' I'he first prize was fifteen dollars ; the second ten . Whitey and I usually won first and second . Then we hurried out to Euclid Beach and knocked off the same prizes there . No one ever believed more in the beneficial results of taking part in athletics than we did . Our No. 1 rival was a boy named Henry Thomas . Henry was a fine athlete who also played the picnic-foot  --  racing circuit . He was faster than we and was getting too many prizes , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motto of the Olympic coach , Mike Murphy , was : " A man who wo n't he beat ca n't be heat . " We did n't want to let Mike Murphy down , so I 'd hump Henry nt the start and Whitey 'd hump him at flfty yards . Whitey and I also dug starting holes . None of the other sprinters did that . They were n't , sure it was ethical . They accepted bumping , but they thought starting holes were a prostitution of sport . This is the kind of thing which comes hack to me when I nudge my alleged mind and dig down under its layers of fat . Thinking of pocket money brings up still another memory . This one has chicken feathers , sweetbreads and a cute lit tle trick named Mildred Rose  --  quist all mixed up in it . My brother , Fred , who was and is a genius at hustling a buck , ran a butcherahop in a stall he leased in the Center Market . When I was seventeen and was begin  --  ning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered me and a pal of mine , Johnny Gibbons , money to use fur stepping nut if we 'd pick and clean chickens for him . So Friday nights we dipped his chickens into boiling-hot water , then plucked and disemboweled them . We got paid on Saturday nights . But if I did n't think Fred had paid me enough , I wrapped up some sweetbreads and took them over to my sweetheart , Mildred Rosequist . Mildred cooked them and we had a feast . It was a chivalrous gesture . if I do say so my  --  self . After all , how many fellows bring sweetbreads to their girls today ? Fred had a diabolical way of embar  --  rassing me before my girl on Saturday nights . About seven-thirty Mildred would come over to the market to wait for me . I 'd he trying to talk her into a session of watching the moonlight on the lake when Fred would say in con  --  versational tones , " Les , would you mind taking the chicken guts down  --  stairs ? " To say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late date is putting it mildly . Somehow , it did n't seem to fit in with romance , and it would have been a pleasure to boil , pluck and disembowel Fred too . Thinking of Mildred brings back the first pass I made at show business . More than anything else , my story is the story of show business , especially vaudeville and tat ) shows . Tab shows were miniature musical comedies which traveled around the country ? " tab " being short for tabloid musical comedy . Mildred was tall , blond , willowy , graceful , and a slick dancer . I thought she was beautiful . She looked as if she 'd done her hair with an egg beater , but I loved it that way . Girls then wore their hair puffed out on each side and stuffed those puffs with wads of false hair they called " rats . " The resulting bulges were known as " cootie garages , " They looked as if they 'd stopped at a filling station and said to the man , " I 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I worked up a dance act and we played a few dates at such places as the Superior Theater . We 'd make seven or eight bucks and Pd split ( Coot on rope 6.1 ) TIFF . SATtlItIll4Y ( Onstitturtl from chile ( 02 ) it with her . I 'd tell the nudience , " This is a little dance we learned in t he living room . " Then we 'd do that one , and I 'd say , " This is a little dance we learned in the kitchen. - Then we 'd do that . We ended with , " This is n dance we learned its the parlor . " The parlor dance was a buck dance we saved for last became , it was our hardest and it left us ex  --  hausted . That seven or eight bucks a perform  --  ance was dizzy stuiT . The applause went to my head even faster . I decided that the stage was my dish . Once I de  --  cided that , I was a pushover for it . I 'd gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to East High . I 'd been in East High only a year and a half when I quit and said to show business , " This thing is bigger than both of us . Let 's not light it . " I planned to take Mildred with me when I left Cleveland to become the Mr. Marvelous of the Footlights . But Mildred 's mother was small-minded about it . She said that even if we got out-of-town bookings  --  which she seri  --  ously doubted ? her daughter could n't go on tour with me unchaperoned . I should never have let her see the act , but she did see it , so she hid Mildred until she was sure I was out of town . Having lost one partner , I picked up another one . Lloyd Durbin , a kid I 'd known around 105th and Euclid . We were lucky enough to wangle a booking into the Bandbox Theater in Cleveland . It , was there that we met Fatty Arbuckle , who was trying a comeback in a small revue . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to the manager of the Band  --  box . He wanted some cheaper and leaner talent , because Fatty was fat both physically and financially . So Lloyd and I stepped cockily into the spot on our Haney plates . Any tap dancer will know what I mean when I say that we had Haney ! Antes screwed into the toes of our shoes . Lloyd and I also did a soft-shoe and a buck-and  --  wing dance in the revue . Then we sang Sweet Georgia Brown and went into our big number , which was a comedy Egyptian dance . Later , I was to do the same dance with Hal LeRoy on the first Frigidaire television show . The Egyp  --  tian flavor was all in pantomime . We did n't wear Egyptian costumes . We wore brown derbies . We pretended to go to a well near the Nile , dip some water in a derby and bring it hack . The gag was that , afterward we poured actual water out of the derby . It was real crazy and it fetched a boll . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Fred Hurley and asked him to " do something " for us . Fred produced lab shows , and he put us in one with the sprightly name of Hurley 's Jolly Follies . The Jolly Follies opened in East Palestine , Ohio , and from there we went into Ottawa , Ohio . Being in a tab show in the 1920 's was an educa  --  tion in show business  --  not higher edu  --  cation , but practical . Tabs were a slightly better grade than burlesque . For one thing , they were n't so smutty . They lasted an hour and a half and fell into two different classifications . There were script tabs , with a plot , and bit . tabs . A bit tab was a lot of blackouts strung together . Blackouts are a device made famous in revues and vaudeville . Right on the punch line of a sketch the stage lights were all switched off to accent the end of a skit . The curtain would be lowered during the blackout ; then it would go up on another scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion picture . We traveled by bus . The audiences were EVENING POST tough . So were the living conditions . We got paid off in lean bellies and laughs . For example , we were sitting on the stage in Ottawa at live o'clock when I naked , " What time is the re  --  hearsal ? " The house manager said , " We re  --  hearse at five-thirty , because the butcher shop does n't close until five-fifteen , " " What 's that got to do with the re  --  hearsal ? " I asked . " The fiddle player works at the butcher shop , " he said . The next year I went out with an  --  other tab , Hurley 's Smiling Eyes . The Jolly Follies had lasted only one season . Which was longer than the Durbin and Hope team had lasted . Tragedy broke up our act . During our first season to  --  gether , Lloyd dropped into a restaurant in Huntington , West , Virginia , and tucked away a harmless-looking wedge of coconut-cream pie . That place must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pains in his stomach . We took him to a local doctor , who said he had food poisoning . Next day we put him on a train on a stretcher and sent him home to Cleveland in the baggage car . When we reached Cleve  --  land , he was rushed to a hospital and they pumped him out . But it was too late . He never got up from that hospital bed . He died . Hurley hired a boy named George Byrne , from Columbus , Ohio , to be Lloyd 's replacement . George was pink-checked and naive , but he was a smooth dancer and had a likable per  --  sonality . We became good friends . We still are . Hope and Byrne were n't together long before we asked Frank Maley , who managed the tab for Hurley , if he would n't let us do comedy as well as dancing . We were doing all right . We were stopping the show with our danc  --  ing . But we were ambitious and we wanted to do better . We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business all by itself ? we 'd studied saxophone playing out of books . In addition , I sang in the quartet , did juvenile leads and character parts . " We 've got one script tab , The Blackface Follies , we can put on , " Maley said . " We 'll find out how funny you are in that . " We opened The Blackface Follies in McKeesport , Pennsylvania . Somehow , George and I got hold of a can of black grease paint instead of burnt cork and , not knowing better , we slathered it on , We felt proud when Maley said , " My , you look glossy . " It was an understate F'ehroinry IA , 19S4 meat . We shone like neon lights . But after the show , when we tried to re  --  move the stuff , it sank in instead of coming off . I 've still got some of it in my veins . We stayed in the theater , working with wash basins and cold cream , until two in the morning . At one point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After that we told Maley we thought we 'd skip blacklace . " It breaks our sleep , " we said . " We do n't get home and get to bed until time for the next , show . " Not all of the comedy connected with tab shows took place in the theater . In our second season we were in Braddock , Pennsylvania . My brother Jim lived in Pittsburgh , and one night after the show I decided I wanted to go see him . A local yokel who had been hanging around the stage door  --  there were alwayssuch hangers-on , especially if there were girls in the show  --  heard me say I wanted to go to Pittsburgh . " I 'll drive you , " he told me . " I 'm go  --  ing to Pittsburgh too . " When he showed up in a beautiful car , George and I got in and be took off down the main street . Presently we heard a siren . The fellow who was driving us looked in the rear-vision mirror and began to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . By this time he was doing fifty or sixty per down the main street . " Cops ! " be said . He pulled into an alley , put on the brakes , and the car rolled dnwn into a gully . Then he ran into the hushes , leaving George and me standing there . The cops got out , walked up to us and said , " Put up your hands ! " I said , " Well " And they said , " Shut up . You 're in a stolen car . " We cut now to the Braddock jail , and I 'm saying to the copper , " We 're playing the theater here . Ask anybody . I tell you we 're playing ? " But the cop said , " Get in that cell . You can read us your clippings in the morning . " So George and / stayed in the cell all night , sharing it with a wife beater . We knew he was a wife beater because he told us all about it in detail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Why do n't you promise to be nice , Joe ? If you do , we 'll let you go home . " " Nab , " the wife beater said . " Da hell with da wife . Next time I fix her good . " He got on our nerves . We were afraid he 'd go to sleep and dream one imt dined on Pape 67 ) ( l'auttittur41 films rase of us was his wife . ( it4srgtn and I spent the night huddled ' Tel lie : , swearing In defend each other , and promising each rather we would go down tight ing to the death . We were afraid our cell mate Ii ail 11 piece of pipe in his pocket . In the morning , when Maley camp around and identified us , we were a bedraggled pair . It turned out ( hal the guy who 'd rolled the car Mk , t he gully worked for a local doctor as a chauffeur-man-of  --  all-work , The doctor was out , of town , and the chauffeur took his car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the car was gone , she reported it to the police . When the chauffeur heard I he police sirens , he 'd lost his head . He could have lost ours too . There 's no way in which I can meas  --  ure in dollars and cents the seasoning , the poise and t he experience that being with Hurley gave me . Years later . I went into the Broadway musical Roberta . I was given the juvenile corn  --  xly lead . When I went on and played it without fainting , freezing or falling into the footlights with a case of first-night jitters , the director , Edgar Mac  --  Gregor . eyed me in surprise . " How do you know enough to play a part like this ? " he asked . After all the years I 'd spent with Hurley . I asked what seemed to me a natural question : " Is this supposed to be hard ? " And thinking about Roberta brings hack another flood of memories . While I was in that show I had a little Scot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acter I played . I had Marilyn Miller 's old dressing room at the New Amster  --  dam , and Huck sat at the top of the stairs . He was a great come-on , great bait . When the girls went by , they stopped and petted him . As a result , I did a nice business with those beauties . My dresser . Frank Rockwell , said to me , " Do n't ever get married . You 're doing tine the way it is . " " Do n't worry . " I said . " The way I figure it , marriage will only dull things up . I 'd also bought a long , sleek Pierce Arrow and had hired a chauffeur . The reason for this flashy turnout was my feeling that now I was in a Broadway hit , I ought to stop using anything so plebeian as a taxi I thought I ought to drive up to the theater , get out , throw copies of my pictures to the populace like confetti , then dash into the stage door , calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One night while I was in Roberta , my pal , George Murphy . who was doing a tine job of specialty capering in the show , invited me to the Lambs Club . We downed a couple of beers , and he said , " I want you to hear a girl sing . Her name is Dolores Reade . She sings at the Vogue Club . " We went over to the Vogue , on 57th Street . It was a little club Bea Lillie had opened . She did n't own it , but she 'd opened it . And I heard this girl sing . She had a low , husky voice and she sang somewhat in the style of Marion Harris  --  soft and sweet , not a shouter . Dinah Shore comes close to being like Dolores , today . She sang It 's Only a Paper Moon and Did You Ever See a Dream Walking ' ? That did it , and I asked if I could take her out .

" From then on , I was at the Vogue every night , wailing to take Dolores home . I must have given the doorman at her apartment I houssnds of dollars in tips to let , me park in front of the joint and sit t here with her . I ( 1641116 ( 14ml I he chauffeur and we talked .

She must have meant it , because she broke her Florida contract and came back to New York . About t hat time I went back to Cleveland to see my mother , who was desperately ill . While I was gone , Dolores saw a statement in a gossip column . It said : " A certain chorus girl says she 's going to marry Bob Hope . " I had n't . Been that girl for six months , but . it . almost broke up our romance . It would have finished it if I had n't been able to convince Dolores that the whole thing was a columnist 's blooper . After that , we went hack to sitting in front of her apartment and making plans to get married . We picked Erie , Pennsylvania , for our wedding . I ca n't remember why . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were married , I put Dolores into my vaudeville act . Roberta had closed , so we went around the big-time circuits together . Our act went some  --  thing like this : I did my regular act. ; then I introduced her . She came out , dressed in a lovely gown , looking very beautiful , and sang a song . After her first song , I came hack out , and when she started her second number , I did n't leave the stage . I just stayed there , standing close to her and looking at her . Then I looked at the audience wit h an expression which asked . " Ai n't she beautiful ' ? Ai n't she something ? How about it ? Just bow about it ? " I stroked her arm , pretending it looked good enough to eat , which was n't hard to do . Then I nibbled it gently . This brought a roar from the audience .

But enough of this warming up . I ought to he able to put my memories down in regular order now . I might go off at a tangent now and then , but for the most part I think I can keep them on the beam . I was horn in 1903 at Eltham in Kent County , England . Eltham is about ten miles from Charing Cross Station in London and is pro  --  nounced without the h . When I was about two years old , my father and mother moved to Bristol .

I 've been leery of dog acts ever since . The rock throwers must have been cads or they would n't have flung a dornick at that small bundle of pink-and-white loveliness , Leslie Townes Hope . That was me . I was named for a relative who 'd been with Chinese Gordon in I he Sudan . Gordon was the British gen  --  eral who fought one of Britain 's little wars in China in the early 1860 's .

He 's modeid I hal way . But it 's all right with him if you guess I hat my rescuer 's first name rhymes with liver . According to Ivor , Wt . Hopes lived in : 1 14111111. ? house at Elllaint wit li a con  --  servatory in back . With no English  --  man 's passion for privacy . my dad had crusted the high brick wall surrounding t he place with liniken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was also a sporting man . He raised gamecocks and lie fought them against the leading rivals . It may not seem sporting today , but it was considered so then to toss a gamecock into a barrel with a ferret to see which would win . The chicken always did . But my dad had his softer side . He was also a flower hobbyist , specializing in chrysanthe  --  mum culturing . Ivor says he grew mums as big as soccer balk . Ivor also remembers father teaching us to box down in our cellar , and hold  --  ing out his chin at us and saying , " Hit it " He recalls Grandpop Hope put ting me up on a table and making me dance or sing or play a tune on a comb cov  --  ered with tissue . Ivor says he heard me recite The Burial of Sir John Moore for grandpop when I was four . He swears that for some reason grandpop called me " Tin Ribs . " Grandpop made his living as a gen  --  eral contractor . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sons to he subcontractors . I 've al  --  ready said that my dad was a master stonemason . In addition . my Uncle Fred was a steamtitter , my Uncle Sid was a carpenter , my Uncle Jack was a specialist in brickwork , Uncle Frank was a master plumber . My aunts were taught trades too . One of them learned to be a corsetmaker , another a dress  --  maker . They learned the hard way , serving as apprentices . Grandpop 's youngest son , Uncle Percy , was not much older than my oldest brother , Ivor . In spite of his name  --  perhaps because of it  --  Percy was a hard citizen . He 'd ask us small Hopes , " Is there anybody you do n't like ? " If we mentioned anyone , Perc would sock him on the nose . According to Ivor , the Hopes at Ell ham not only had a house complete with conservatory and fighting cocks , we also bad a basket-weave trap , or pony cart , and a pony to pull it . II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somebody gave Uncle Perc and Ivor a shilling and they drove me into London in the pony cart in search of q delicacy known as " fagots and peas . " A fagot looked like a long ham  --  burger . Tying Ginger , the pony , outside the fagot-and-peas joint , we went in . When we came out with h the wrinkles ironed from our bellies , both Ginger and the basket-weave trap had disap  --  peared . With forebodings of disaster , we started home . ( Ivor does n't recall whether we walked or took a train . ) Unknown to us . Ginger had arrived home , dragging the trap upside down , and the London police had been alerted to look for us . When they found us and took us home , my grandmother led Uncle Pere out into the stable , took down a buggy whip and let him have it . When mother begged her to lei him off , she told mother sternly , " Stand aside or I 'll thrash you too . " Grand  --  mother came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corsage of memories is one of my dad perching me on t he handlebars of his bicycle and pedaling off to the Crystal EVENING 1.4 Palace to join the rest of the family , who were listening to a musical con  --  cert . Somewhere along the way t he bicycle fell into a ditch and dad and I arrived at the Crystal Palace covered with bandages . To my mother , the most shocking thing about the accident was the fact that between home and the Crystal Palace clad had shaved off the must ache he 'd worn for years . Dad was not only an artist with stone-cutting tools , he was n happy-type man . He loved to live it up . He was popular , and a great entertainer . He was also well read . Later on , when we 'd moved to Cleveland , professors from Case Institute and Western Re  --  serve University dropped in to talk his  --  tory with him . He had only one fault . It was his theory that . as a result of his occupa  --  tion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off at pubs to sluice it out . The trouble was that once he 'd washed the inside of his throat , he stopped at a few more places for some  --  thing to " steady " himself . Sometimes he was so steady he could n't move . The day he fell off the bicycle with me must have been one of those times when his throat . was dusty . But I was too young to realize that . I was also too young to know that while dad made a lot of money as a stonemason-builder , he lost most of it on the horses . He got in with a fast sporty set . Then the horses and high living got into him . When he lost his bundle , he came to the United States to make a fresh start . I do n't remember my grandfather or my grandmother from those days . Grandpop had built the row of houses in Ell ham , in one of which we lived . They were put together like stone bat  --  tleships . Another of gra nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town of 700 homes . Letchworth was called the Garden City of England . He was a great one for " ribbon " building . We call it row-house building in this coun  --  try . He 'd have had a hall in the early days of Baltimore or Philadelphia . Sometime in the 1890 's , grandpop came to the U.S.A. and built churches in Detroit and in Cleveland . But grand  --  mother said she would n't come to America until they built a bridge across the Atlantic , so he went back home to be with her . It was n't until I went hack to Eng  --  land in 1939 that I got to know him . It , was the first time I 'd been there since I was four . I took Dolores with use and February 13. 1934 - we I hrew a party for my relatives at a puh in where rseh showed grandpop dpupo p After living . if all yttlYel innhdogi nr.d.thi.nnwGeeeir , u pt heany and I odookesodmaet. nu ? its thing . We 've heard you 're funny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oat kht e sern.peGu : dr ) aednal.ndd pan . It made ale nervous , 110 I said , - Now let 's get Uncle John up here . They tell me he whistles . " " You 're doing it wrong , " grandpop said . " You do n't know these people . You 've been a tourist . Let me do the in  --  troducing . " He was ninety-six then , rut he was a hall of tire on his feet , a George Jesse or an Al ben Barkley with an English accent . He had so much moxie I got a kick out of him . He was st ill riding a bicycle . Later , when they took it away from him , he kept right on ambling down to the pub for his shot of nourishment and to say hello to the boys . And when he felt perky he did a clog dance . One of his eyes had started to go and his hear  --  ing was going . He claimed that he could hear through his eyes , so I yelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine that way . In 1943 I was playing a fighter base only an hour and a half 's ride from Hitchin . When I walked into the theater , they told me grandpop was out front . When I called him up on the stage , he came up the aisle , leaning on his cane , I introduced him , and that audience of fliers gave him a cheer . He made a little speech . He said that it was nice to be there , and that he wanted to with them luck in their mis  --  sions , and he hoped that they would help bring peace to the world . Those slow words from an old gentleman lean  --  ing feebly on his cane carried quite an emotional wallop . Then he went back to his seat . Three weeks later , when he was ninety-nine years and eleven months old , he died . I was playing Birming  --  ham and 1 got a call to rush to Hitchin . I got there just in time to see him be  --  fore he left us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is not something some  --  body told me concerns an incident that happened on shipboard crossing the Atlantic . Everybody was lined up to he vaccinated . I was only two away from getting the scratch when I decided that I did n't like it , and headed a Keystone-cop chase around t he decks with every  --  body after me . They finally cornered me and scraped me with the scalpel ; which was the way they let you have it in those days . After it was all over , my mother tried to wipe the vaccine away from my lacerated arm with her hand . She must have had a cut on her thumb and some of that vaccine must have got into it . Anyhow , she had a vaccination scar on her thumb which she carried to her grave . If I had known about the things that were waiting for me once I 'd pasted through Quarantine at Ellis Island , I 'd have been more scared than I was of the doctor who jabbed my arm . It 's a good thing nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told him about a place called Holly  --  wood and a street called Broadway , and informed him that when he grew up his voice and his ski snoot would go out over the air with no wires to carry them . These things were tough enough to wrestle with when they did come along .
