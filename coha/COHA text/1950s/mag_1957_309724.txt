BENJY ( 143 pp. ) - Edwin O'Connor-Atlantic , Little Brown ( $4 ) . <P> <P> Little Benjamin Thurlow Ballou is as sweet as a cluster of lollipops . Though he is only three years old , Benjy is the best little tot in Smiles , Pa. , and he always does just what his Mummy tells him . In the morning he puts on his little pink shoes and his little pink sugarplum bathrobe all by himself , and at night he puts his cute little toys neatly away in his playbox . All this makes Benjy feel " toasty-warm all over . " and he ca n't help snuggling up to his mother and saying , " I 'm gwad you my Mummy , Mummy . " <P> The title page warns that Edwin O'Connor-author of The Last Hurrah , that uproarious and thinly disguised novel about Boston 's raffish former Mayor Curley-intends Benjy as a " ferocious fairy tale . " But readers can settle back unappre-hensively and enjoy this blithe-spirited , Thurberesque fable of a little boy who is too good for his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39 , gets in some Wylie digs at Mummy . Though the fun sometimes wears thin , Benjy is a striking display of virtuosity , proving that its author can move with literary ease from Curley to curb/locks . <P> The Cigar Hunt . When Mrs. Ballou is n't bear-hugging her little darling , she likes to gaze fondly at her college diploma framed upon the wall . Some people , she points out to Benjy , lack her advantages . The most conspicuous lackee is Daddy Ballou , a monosyllabic TV repairman . Daddy usually climbs into the TV set after dinner , or sometimes with his dinner , and fiddles with a few wires . Daddy and Mummy also play a game called " Cigar Hunt , " which Mummy generally wins with the magic words . " All right . . . hand it over ! " For Mummy 's sake Benjy is anxious to straighten out poor Daddy . Speaking in the third person , as he sometimes does , Benjy promises that when he goes to school , " he 's going to study hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can give one to Daddy . " <P> When the great day comes for Benjy to go to school . Mummy is so thrilled that she puts on her college cap and gown and skips along the sidewalk with Benjy , singing her college song . To his " School Mummy , " as he calls his teacher . Benjy is unbearably good , too . He pledges allegiance to the flag twice , and he tells teacher things she might not otherwise know-like which kid did the whispering . <P> The Big , Black Egg . Naturaly this does not endear little Benjy to the dirty-fingernail set in the schoolyard , but Benjy has his reward when his Good Fairy shows up . An offbeat sort decked in a baseball uniform and chomping an outsize cigar , this Good Fairy grants Benjy 's only wish that " whatever big and marvelous things happen to little Benjy . . . will happen to his dear Mummy , too ! " Months pass , and nothing happens until one day Mummy and Benjy drag sulky old Daddy out on a picnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells him not to fool around with it , but Mummy mutters in her through-closed-teeth voice : " Do n't try to make a craven out of my son !
