The formal announcement of Mr. Gifford 's selection for the London post is , meanwhile , awaiting the official exchanges with the British Government that must accompany a change in diplomatic representation . One of the factors behind the choice of Mr. Gifford , an active Republican , to the ranking diplomatic assignment , informed quarters believed , was the desire by the President to further strengthen the bipartisan character of the Administration 's foreign policy . It was also understood that Secretary of State Dean Acheson and General of the Army George C. Marshall , new Secretary of Defense , had recommended Mr. Gifford as a successor to Mr. Douglas with the factor of bipartisanship in mind .

British Surprised and Sad Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES . LONDON , Sept. ** resignation of Lewis W. Douglas took the British people by surprise tonight . They had come to regard him as part of the London scene . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a place in the hearts of the British people . He did not have very intimate contacts with more than a few members of the Labor Government . He , and especially his wife and daughter Sharman , moved mostly in the higher circles of society and their closest friends were within the restricted royal circle . Nevertheless , to the average Briton , Mr. Douglas was a good Ambassador . When he made a speech on the theme of " hands across the sea " it was prominently printed in the London press . But when he said " no " to the Foreign Office , few newspaper men were privy to the fact . Few people in this country knew or know what Mr. Douglas thinks about their Government or the Opposition . Now that Mr. Douglas has quit , there is only sympathy and admiration for him here . Ever since he hooked his eye casting for salmon , the people generally have sympathized with him and admired his courage in sticking to his job and coming back to it even after the more wearing strain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to his post that the wear and tear on his body had been more than he could bear . from Lewis W. Douglas . Ambassador to Britain , to President Tru-man : My Dear Mr. President : When you asked me to accept the position of Ambassador to the Court of St. James it was generally agreed that I would be free to . retire on or about the 20th of January , 1949 . You and Mr. Acheson reposed in me enough confidence to ask that I remain on beyond that date . This I have been glad to do . The experience here in London has been extraordinarily interesting and I am more grateful to you than I can say for having made the horizon of my life broader because of it and for having brought me into association with the many international problems that have arisen during the almost four years of my stay in London . The time , however , has now come when personal considerations , including those of health , compel me , with great reluctance , to submit my resignation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make effective on or about Nov. 1 . At the same time that I submit my resignation may I make two points . The first is that a continuing close relationship between our own country and the people of the British Isles and of the British Commonwealth of Nations , even though that , relationship has now become somewhat merged with international organizations in which we all play a part and which we all support , is one of the solid cornerstones of the civilized world . The second is that the situation which confronts our country and the community of free nations , together with the heavy burdens you have to bear , naturally would make me Want to serve should you later call on me again . But in order to be available I am advised I must now have several months of rest . I can only again thank you for the confidence you have placed in me , and express the hope that should you find that I can be helpful at some time in the future you will not hesitate to call upon me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text of President Truman 's reply to Ambassador Douglas : Dear Lew : It is with most genuine regret that I feel I must , for the personal reasons you have explained to me , accede to your request to retire . The loyal service you have rendered your country during these difficult and critical years in such a vital spot , the understanding you have shown of all the complex problems of today , the wise counsel you have given me in seeking their solution , and the broad appreciation of the fundamentals of our relationship to the British Commonwealth are considerations which make my decision to let you go difficult . I know that those of our fellow countrymen who have knowl- , edge of the quality and importance of the service you have given will share in this regret . Few of them , however , can realize the great courage and devotion you have shown in sticking on at your post in the face of such compelling reasons of health . They will , however , I know , all share with me fervent wishes for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may at some early date call upon you once again to help meet our country 's needs . Your mission to London , so faithfully and efficiently discharged now for three and onehalf years during a time of mounting crisis in Europe and throughout the world , rounds out a career of singular versatility and usefulness . It has been given to few of our citizens to render such high service in fields of responsibility so varied and diverse . With every good wish , Gratefully and sincerely , HARRY S. TRUMAN .
