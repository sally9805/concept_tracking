Earl " Fatha " Mines Solo ( Fantasy LP ) , the first solo album in years by one of the granddaddies of the modern jazz piano . The selections-My Monday Date , Deep Forest , R. R. Blues-span much of the " Fatha 's " career , starting with the late ' 20s , when he was jamming with Louis Armstrong in Chicago . The left hand is as bouncy and ebullient as ever ; the famous " trumpet " right hand still shimmies over the keys and chops out the big , gaudy chords that have been the envy of a generation of jazz pianists . <P> After Glow ( Carmen McRae ; Decca LP ) . Songstress McRae gives a torchy , slickly phrased reading to such old standbys as Nice Work If You Can Get It and My Funny Valentine , and less familiar numbers , e.g. , Guess Who I Saw Today ? The voice is too anemic for the big , strutting talk , but just right for the languorous , blues-flavored chitchat of a girl who has been there before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 LPs ) . This lushly packaged , $20 salute to the most influential jazz soloist of them all traces his long career from the shouting , heavily riffed style he learned from Joe Oliver in his Chicago days ( Dipper Mouth Blues , High Society ) to the high , singing lyricism of the late ' 20s and early ' 30s , admirably illustrated in one of his own alltime favorites : On the Sunny Side of the Street . Most of the numbers , recorded at the end of 1956 , are replays of records Louis cut between ' 23 and ' 34 , some of them amplified by the famous , gravelly Armstrong voice . The album is marred by a hackneyed script , read by Satchmo , but it should give latter-day jazz fans , who know him only as the aging vaudevillian , an idea of what the shouting was about . <P> Tammy ( Debbie Reynolds ; Coral ) .

A fey , offbeat collection of songs both sprightly and shivery by the apricot-haired English comedienne , with tongue-in-jowl introductions by husband Charles Laughton . The selections range from Fiji Fanny , a raucous burlesque of the songs the trade calls " grass-skirt numbers , " to a haunted , spine-crawling ditty titled If You Peek in My Gazebo , which tells the tale of a mad New England spinster who sits each evening in a summerhouse on the hill secretly watching the lusty young village bucks stroll by . <P> First Place ( J. J. Johnson ; Columbia LP ) . The current ruling jazz trombonist struts some of his limber-lined , impeccably phrased stuff on a fine solo album . The selections include revamped oldies such as It 's Only a Paper Moon , a haunting blues number called Harvey 's House , and a scattering of pleasant Johnson originals . <P> Mr. Lee ( The Bobbettes ; Atlantic ) .
