It is nearly 300 years since a crotchety Boston artillery captain named Robert Keayne died and left his city money for a fine new building with " a convenient roome for a Library &; a gallery or some other handsome roome for the Elders to meete in and conferr . " That , in 1658 , gave Boston the first public library in the U.S. Since then , U.S. communities have kept right on building , now have 7,408 of them . How well do they serve ? <P> To find out , a special Public Library Inquiry , headed by onetime Bennington College President Robert D. Leigh , went to work three years ago with a $200,000 grant from the Carnegie Corporation . Part of the money went for a nationwide poll of reading habits . Last week the inquiry 's answer , The Public Library in the United States ( Columbia University Press ; $3.75 ) , pronounced the state of the nation 's libraries only fair . <P> One big trouble , concluded the inquiry , is public apathy . U.S. citizens spend $100 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-thirds of what they spend on bowling alleys and billiards . Furthermore , although 90% of U.S. adults listen to the radio every day , and 50% of them go to the movies at least once a fortnight , about half ( 48% ) never read a book from one year 's end to another . Only one in ten is a library regular . <P> How much of a selection does the average regular get when he does go to his library ? Not much , reports the inquiry . Ninety percent of U.S. libraries are in towns of under 5,000 to 25,000 people . Many of them have fewer than 6,000 books , struggle along with budgets of less than $4,000 , are able to buy only 330 books a year , including replacements of worn-out favorites . At least two-thirds of all U.S. libraries have no adequate stock of reference works , make too little attempt to enrich their shelves with classics . <P> Most disturbing of all , says the inquiry , is the fact that one-third of the nation is without any public-library facilities whatever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means to provide and maintain them . If the U.S. as a whole is to get adequate library service , concludes the inquiry , existing libraries must give up their isolation . Instead , they should be linked together in regional networks , buying in common , exchanging books , records and films , supporting a common staff of experts .
