From their posts at Camp Barrett , two U.S. Marine sentries spotted a strange object and , in the best traditions of General Order No. 2 ( " To observe everything that takes place within sight or hearing " ) , made their report to the Officer of the Day : a flying saucer had just landed near Quantico , Va. , some 15 miles away . Marine spokesmen staunchly denied that 1 ) a Marine helicopter had flown to investigate and found nothing , 2 ) two platoons had been deployed to capture The Thing . <P> Last week the marines ' flying saucer was identified : a new type of red blinker light on commercial airliners , stronger than those previously in use .
