With its front page still carrying stories about the Greenlease kidnaping case ( TIME , Oct. 12 et seq. ) , the St. Louis Post-Dispatch last week printed a brief announcement on its comic page in place of two popular comic strips : " The Buz Sawyer and Steve Roper serial strips have been omitted . They will not be restored until after the kidnaping episodes in both strips , which may be offensive to many readers at this time . . . " After the announcement appeared , the paper was flooded with letters , many approving the P-D 's move . But other readers were just as strong against dropping the strips . Wrote one reader : " An editor has no license to censor a feature of his paper simply because it may be offensive to some people . "
