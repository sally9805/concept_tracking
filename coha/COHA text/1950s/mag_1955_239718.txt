On his Sunday night broadcasts Columnist Walter Winchell likes to pass out hot tips on stocks to his millions of listeners . Last week some of the heat was on Columnist Winchell himself . In Washington SEC investigators were checking to see if cunning speculators in Florida , where Winchell vacations , had used the columnist to clean up a quick profit at the expense of foolish listeners . <P> The stock was Pantepec Oil Co. , a small company listed on the American Stock Exchange . In his Jan. 9 broadcast Winchell had a " piece of big advance news " that Pantepec had discovered " substantial oil reserves in the El Roble fields in Venezuela , " and would hand out a stock dividend . <P> Actually , as in many cases before , Winchell 's news was hardly new . Pantepec had announced its discovery on Nov. 24 . The New York Times had already printed a note about it without affecting the market notably . But the week before Winchell 's tip , heavy buying , reportedly in Florida , pushed Pantepec 's stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 to 6 . The Monday following Winchell 's broadcast Pantepec sold an alltime record 357,500 shares , at 8 ? , up more than two points . Soon after , Pantepec started dropping , to 7 at week 's end . The paper loss to investors on Winchell 's tip was an estimated $500,000 , plus another $100,000 in commissions . <P> There is no doubt that some speculators are cleaning up on Winchell tips . Many traders , gambling that a Winchell-tipped stock will rise on Monday and then drop , sell it short . In Pantepec the short interest jumped from 500 shares on Dec. 15 to 92,327 shares on Jan. 14 . Thus , those who sold the stock short after the tip instead of buying it , have already cleaned up more than $100,000 on the drop .
