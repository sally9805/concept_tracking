When President Eisenhower took office last January , he had the editorial support of more than 80% of U.S. dailies , the biggest newspaper backing any Administration has ever had . Washington newsmen , however , were less enthusiastic about the new Republican Administration than the papers they worked for ; a big majority of the reporters were for Stevenson during the campaign . Nevertheless , newsmen were willing to wait and see how the new Administration would get along with the press . After nine months in office , how do Washington newsmen feel about Ike and his Administration ? <P> Last week Agriculture Secretary Ezra Taft Benson gave a part of the answer . Into the Agriculture Department 's conference room crowded almost 100 reporters to hear about the department 's new reorganization plans . " The Secretary , " announced Benson 's press officer , " will start off the presentation , then Assistant Secretary Earl Coke will follow with details and present some slides . Please hold your questions until we get through the presentation . " Forty-five minutes later , when the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to question Benson about his controversial farm program . As Benson marched from the room , it was clear that for him-if not for the newsmen-the " presentation " had been a success . <P> Man on the Beat . The big complaint of capital reporters is that news by presentation is the cornerstone of the Administration 's press relations . As a result , newsmen often get little chance to question top Government men if the presentation does not answer their questions or explain the policies satisfactorily . Complains New York Times Correspondent Bill Lawrence : " There 's too much B.B.D. &; O. " Trying to reach sources directly to get the answers has posed another problem . Top Ikemen have generally become available to bureau chiefs , columnists and publishers , but newsmen covering routine beats are often left with little more than handouts . " I can get to see Brownell pretty readily , " explains one Washington bureau chief , " but my beat man at Justice has a bad time even reaching any of the Assistant Attorneys General . " <P> The presentation trouble goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the President himself is friendly , at ease and no longer worried about questions that reporters might ask , though he has held only 15 press conferences . ( In the first year of office , Truman had 42 , Roosevelt 102 and Hoover 23 . ) But his announcements are made flatly , with little elaboration . Newsmen who try to question him are often good-naturedly , but nonetheless firmly , brushed aside . As a result , their reports are often confusing . Fortnight ago , after Ike was questioned on balancing the budget , the New York Times headlined : <P> <P> EISENHOWER IS FIRM ON BUDGET BALANCE . But the Washington Post reporting Ike 's answer to the same question , said : <P> PROLONGED BUDGET DEFICIT IS IMPLIED BY EISENHOWER . <P>
