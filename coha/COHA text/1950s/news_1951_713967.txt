txt 7 CONVICTED REDS ARE TAKEN TO JAIL ; 4 FAIL TO APPEAR Fugitives Have Until Today to Surrender or Forfeit Their Bail Totaling $80,000 $110,000 FINES COLLECTED Possibility Seen That Missing ; Men May Have Fled Country or Started Underground By RUSSELL PORTER Seven of the eleven Communist leaders convicted in 1949 surrendered yesterday to serve their jail terms , but four others failed to appear . Bench warrants were issued for the arrest of the four , and they have until 10:30 A. M. today to give up or forfeit their bail totaling $80,000 . Their incarceration has been ordered under the Supreme Court decision of June 4 affirming their conviction . Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and of the United States Marshal 's office began a search for the missing men . " The full facilities of the ' , F. B. I. are being used to ascertain their whereabouts , " said an F. B. I. statement in Washington . The F. B. I. refused to comment on the possibility that the men had fled the country , as did Gerhardt Eisler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Polish liner Batory in 1949 and forfeited $23,500 bail . Absence of 4 Unexplained No explanation for the absence of the four was offered by the seven who surrendered or by their attorneys . Some observers of the Communist movement thought it possible that the four had gone into hiding to form a new underground Politburo with three other Communist leaders who have been fugitives from justice since June 20 . On that date twenty-one Communist leaders were indicted on charges of criminal conspiracy to teach and advocate overthrow of the ' Government by force and violence  --  the same charges as those on which the eleven were convicted . Four of the twenty-one could not be found , and three of them were members of the alternate national committee set up to take over when the eleven should finally be sent to jail . All eleven are members of the party 's national committee or ruling body . According to the new indictment it was part of the conspiracy that the defendants should carry out plans for the " vital parts " of the Communist party of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of emergency . The four who failed to surrender yesterday were Henry Winston , the party 's national organization secretary ; Robert Thompson , New York State chairman ; Gilbert Green , Illinois chairman , and Gus Hall , national secretary . Those missing since June 20 are James E. Jackson , Southern regional director ; Sidney Stein or . Steinberg , assistant national labor secretary ; Fred Fine , secretary of the public affairs department , and William Marron , New York State executive secretary . The three first named are members of the alternate national committee . Those Who Surrendered The seven who surrendered were Eugene Dennis , general secretary ; John B. Williamson , national labor secretary ; John Gates , editor of The Daily Worker ; Irving Potash , Carl Winter , Michigan chairman ; Jack Stachel , director of agitation , propaganda and education , and Benjamin J. Davis Jr. , former Councilman of New York . Hall , formerly Ohio chairman , was recently made the party 's national secretary . At the time of this appointment , it was reported that he might replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party . Now that Dennis is in jail , and Hall is not , it was pointed out , Hall might function as head of the underground Politburo . Of the eleven convicted in 1949 , ten were sentenced to five years in jail each . Thompson , the eleventh , because of his war record , got three years . Each was fined $10,000 , and $110,000 in cash was posted with the clerk of the Federal District Court to guarantee payment of the fines . This $110,000 was collected by the Government yesterday . Most of the eleven were held in $20,000 bail each , a few in $30,000 . The eleven were indicted nearly three years ago , together with William Z. Foster , the party 's national chairman . Because of illness , Fos // ter has not been tried . The eleven had a nine-month trial before Judge Harold R. Medina . After their conviction , they appealed on the ground , among other things , that the Smith Act under which they were prosecuted was an unconstitutional infringement upon the rights of free speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court , after six months ' consideration , upheld the constitutionality ... of the Smith Act in view of the " clear and present danger " inherent in the . secret nature of the conspiracy , On Saturday , after the period of grace that follows a Supreme Court decision , the mandate of the high court was handed down . This constituted an order to the Federal District Court here to put the sentences into effect . The mandate arrived in New York yesterday gatirning . Eleven Ordered to Appear In anticipation of its arrival , United States Attorney Irving H. Saypol notified the eleven by telegram to appear before Federal Judge Sylvester Ryan at 10:30 o'clock yesterday morning . With Mr. Saypol in court yesterday were Frank H. Gordon and Edward C. Wallace , who took part in the prosecution of the eleven as assistants to John F. X. , then the United States Attorney , now a Federal District Judge . Harry Sacher and Abraham J. Isserman appeared as defense counsel . They are among six members of defense counsel sentenced by Judge Medina at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail for criminal contempt . After seven defendants had answered when the names of the eleven were called , Mr. Saypol moved that the mandate of the Supreme Court be made the order of the district court . Sacher argued against this on the ground that the prosecutor h'ad acted without authority in ordering the defendants to appear before the mandate was received here . Judge Ryan brushed aside the objection and signed the order as requested by Mr. Saypol . Mr. Saypol then moved that the seven be remanded to jail , that bail for the missing four be canceled and that bench warrants be issued for them . He recalled that last Friday Sacher had promised Judge Ryan that all eleven defendants would appear in court yesterday . Against this , Sacher argued that the sentences should be reduced , suspended or stayed until the end of current hearings before the new Subversive Activities Control Board in Washington on the proposed registration of the Communist party . Isserman argued for a stay of execution of Stachel 's sentence because of illness . Mr. Saypol replied that defense arguments were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the District Court , the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court . " We in this courthouse have seen the result of this conspiracy , " Mr. Saypol added , " in the trials that have been held for subversion , for espionage and for treason . " Defendants Permitted to Speak At the request of Sacher , Judge Ryan agreed to hear some of the defendants on the understanding that they talk only on their applications for lifting or modifying the sentences , and not engage in " philosophical discussion . " Davis , who spoke first , launched into a tirade against his sentence as being an attack on " democracy , the working class of this country , and the Negro people . " Judge Ryan directed him to cease , but Davis kept on talking , raising his voice . The judge then called deputy marshals , who led Davis back to his seat , still talking . Finally the judge threatened to hold him in contempt if he did not sit down and keep quiet , and Davis subsided , glowering et the court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off without jail sentences . When Winter said the Communists were devoted to " peace , " Judge Ryan replied : " A good many of us may have doubts as to the purpose ' of the party  --  doubts substantiated by recent world events . " Judge Ryan then denied all defense applications and remanded the seven to jail . He gave directions that the warden of Stachel 's prison send to the court within thirty days a medical report on his condition , The judge ordered the issuance of the bench warrants , but reserved decision until this morning at 10:30 o'clock on the motion to , cancel bail . If the missing four have not appeared then , he said , he would forfeit their bail . As the seven were led out , - they waved to relatives and frtends in the crowded courtroom . The latter stood up , waving and making the Communist closed-fist salute . When deputies ordered them to sit down , they did so , but continued ? On wave . Only a few dozen sympathizers had stood at the front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds who used to picket and shout defiance during the trial . When the seven , handcuffed together in pairs except for Potash , who walked alone , were taken away in a prison van , only six or eight . friends stood at the rear of the courthouse ai.d waved farewell . The seven were taken to the Federal house of Detention on West Street to await word from Washington on what Federal prisons they are to be sent to . Thin morning the seventeen arrested on June 20 are scheduled to appear in Federal District Court to plead to the indictment .
