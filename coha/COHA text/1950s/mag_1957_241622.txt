SCENT OF CLOVES ( 320 pp. ) - Norah Lofh-Doubleday ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> There is only one thing remarkable about this book : it smells . Evidently in the belief that the practice of reading has become hopelessly discredited , Doubleday has tried the desperate expedient of dousing Scent of Cloves in some odorous compound that purports to be scent of cloves . Whether packs of osmophile readers will go like beagles into bookstores snuffing the spoor is questionable . <P> Scent of Cloves is a lady 's view of the time of Cromwell , and if Cromwell had been a lady , the view might have been true enough . As it is , it tells a Cinderella story of little Julia Ashley , who is encountered competing with Irish pigs for some swill left behind by the Roundhead soldiery who laid Ireland waste . She grows up to be adopted by a dashing cavalier , farmed out to a Dutch orphanage and , in the natural course of events as they happen in female historical novels , mistress of a great plantation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the islands , hence the smell . <P> Granted that a heavy percentage of every publisher 's seasonal list could well be doused with something or other , preferably Mum , this sort of thing nevertheless will deeply alarm all right-thinking ( and right-smelling ) readers . The precedent raises dreadful possibilities : a whiff of chloroform for Not As a Stranger , essence of unwashed T-shirt for On the Road and the odor of sanctity for The Power of Positive Thinking .
