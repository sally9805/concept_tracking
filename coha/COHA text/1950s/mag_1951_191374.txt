General Motors Corp . last week lost its fight against a rollback of its price increases on 1951 models . To G.M. 's suggestion that the increases be allowed to stand at least until a survey showed they were unjustified , Economic Stabilizer Alan Valentine gave a flat no . His reason : " Earnings of your company in the third quarter are running at the reported annual rate of $1.9 billion , as against an annual average rate of $827 million in the best three years prior to 1950 . " While ESA had " no interest in control of profits arising from increased volume , greater productivity or decreased expenses . . . sellers should not increase prices in order to make greater profits than were made before the Korea outbreak . " <P> Valentine 's reasoning made little sense to G.M. Since it had not raised prices since 1948 , its greater profit in 1950 had come solely because of its increased volume ( 25% more cars and trucks than in 1949 ) and greater productivity . Instead of making greater profits after Korea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the third quarter , net profits were lower than in the pre-Korea second quarter . In the fourth quarter of this year , net profits will probably be still lower because of higher taxes and costs . Nevertheless , G.M. sent telegrams to 12,000 dealers lifting its ban on the sale of 120,000 new Chevrolets , Pontiacs and Cadillacs at pre-December prices . The corporation said it would give rebates to dealers who had already paid higher 1951 prices . In Canada , where there was no price freeze , Ford and Chrysler announced price increases of 4% to 6% on 1951 models .
