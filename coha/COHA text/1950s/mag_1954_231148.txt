Electronic computers are rapidly becoming the oracles of industry . As machines and processes become more complex , problems can become too involved for quick solution by old methods and too vital for trial-and-error testing . Designing a new product-an electronic tube , for instance - may call for thousands of lengthy calculations . Often a computer can polish the whole thing off in a couple of minutes . <P> But computers are expensive , and they require specialized mathematicians to feed their problems to them . To make their talents more easily available , Electronics Associates , Inc. of Long Branch , N.J. <P> this week opened a " computer center " at Princeton . The building is a large stone house built in 1947 by two well-heeled Philadelphia sisters to house a 12 ft. by 14 ft. copy of Rembrandt 's Night Watch . <P> Now the Rembrandt is gone , and the house is stuffed with electronic brains and their human servitors , all available to customers on something akin to a help-yourself automat basis . <P> Graphic Answer . The main unit , a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great variety of jobs . <P> If a client has mathematicians of his own , he can take home a " patch panel " : a metal rectangle containing hundreds of small , marked holes . By connecting the proper holes with plug-in wires , he translates his problem into language that the computer can understand . When the panel is inserted in the Princeton machine , the computer gets to work at once ; numbers flash rapidly across a glass screen , and spidery arms push electronic pens up the peaks and down into the valleys of a long graph . A correct reading of the graph tells the answer . <P> <P> Some of the problems take hours or days , and the client is charged ( at $100 an hour ) by how long he ties up the computer . If he lacks mathematicians , he may bring his problem to the center , where he can hire consultants to translate it into computer language . <P> Speed Test . First client of the center was Westinghouse Electric Corp. , and its problem was how to design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build an experimental model and see how it works when parts of its design are changed slightly . This would cost , Westinghouse figures , about $15,000 . The computer can do the same job estimating the effects of different kinds of coils , metals and insulating material for about $4,000 . <P> Most of the industrial answers are highly technical , having to do with aeronautical , chemical or electronic engineering . But they can be as down-to-earth as a speed test on next year 's automobile design or a weight test on a design for a suspension bridge . A large soap company is currently making a market survey . When all the data is assembled , it will be reduced to formulas punched into a patch panel and fed to the computer . From the result the soap company hopes to discover which of its products are likely to find a future market and which ones it should plan to drop .
