The big painting annual at Manhattan 's Whitney Museum of American Art is one show the critics always study in hopes of spotting a new trend . At the 1952 show , on view last week , the trend spotters needed microscopes to find any changes . <P> <P> All told , 154 artists from 24 states were represented , and most of them seemed to be doing just what they have been doing ever since the war : abstract paintings in all sizes , shapes and colors . The work bore such titles as Sleeper No. 2 , Third Theme , 47 , Vibration and Rapt at Rappaport 's . The color patterns varied from shades of Tabasco red to jellyfish grey ; some were done as geometrical designs , others as waving , leaflike forms , weird blotches of black &; white , or blazing skyrockets of paint on canvas . <P> Nonetheless , some critics thought they saw a slight shifting of the currents in several of the Whitney 's ten galleries . There , the work of more objective artists was on exhibit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Among the best : a compassionate scene of two old Bowery bums . Under the El , by Manhattan 's Jack Levine ; a primitive allegory , Fishers , Simon and Peter , by Manhattan 's C. Murray Foster ; a biting satire , Tension , by St. Louis ' Siegfried Reinhardt , which showed a straining rooster , a bird hanging by its neck , a boy stretching a string , and a man twisting the boy 's head . <P> Director Hermon More , who helped put the show together , disagrees with the critics . He sees no strong hints of a swing toward more representational art . He culled some 1,500 paintings for the show , had to " lean over backwards to get more realistic painters . " Most of those he found were already established artists ; of the unknown good enough to exhibit for the first time , 40 out of 43 were abstractionists . Says More : " It 's hard to find a young artist under 30 these days who paints in any style other than abstract . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
