smile widened slightly with his embarrassment . " I hope I am , " he said . " My pleasures may not be of the violent variety that seem to be so popular today , but such as they are " Nicholas ! " she cried . " I 'm going up to the bar to order a drink . By myself . That 's my kind of fun . That 's the kind of person I am ! " He nodded gravely . " You wo n't shake me in my opinion , Sybil , " he said , " that whatever kind of person you are is a very nice kind of person to be . " She turned from him and hurried up the stairs to the foyer , her eyes full of tears . She skirted her way rapidly through the crowded tables in the foyer until she had found an empty one . She asked the waiter to bring her a brandy . The room looked as though it might be full of familiar faces , but she could not recognize any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ever do but pitch herself against a world that could always annihilate her with a single reproach . Rebellion in a void . Against nothing . When her brandy had come and as she was raising it to her lips she saw Philip , and it seemed as if everything that could pulse and pound within her had suddenly stopped . He was making his way through the tables towards her , and he was smiling . Then she felt blackness all around her and a roaring in her ears . But she did not faint . She did not even smile . " I see that we 're up to our old tricks , " he said , sitting down beside her . " Solitary drinking . A slightly better bar , I admit , but the same thirst . Maybe I should have one too . Just for appearances . " He beckoned to the waiter . She still could not speak . " I telephoned you this evening when I arrived , " he continued , " and heard you were at your aunt 's and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been waiting for you . 1 knew you 'd come alone , because I know your ways . " " Oh , Philip , " she murmured . " Nicholas almost came with me , " she added vaguely . " Well , I 'm glad he did n't . Who is Nicholas ? " She just managed to shrug her shoulders . He could never keep her family straight . " When these people have gone , " he said , " I have something to tell you . Do you mind missing the next act ? " She shook her head . " Well , fine . " Then the bell rang , and she watched the big room grad-e ally empty as the people returned to their seats . In only a few minutes she was alone with him amid the empty tables.  |p102PHILIP  WAS NOT a creature of impulse ; he thought things out carefully , particularly when they concerned himself . When he had finished this orderly process , however , he acted swiftly and logically upon his conclusion . He had talked to Teddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , was only sensible , and Teddy , of course , had entirely reassuredhim , which was equally sensible . He had then addressedhimself to the exact nature of the attraction which she had for him , and he had decided , clearly and definitely , that it was more intense than anything that he had felt before . He had then figured up how many law classes he could afford to cut and had taken a train for New York . The whole procedure would have struck Teddy as calculating , but Philip was always true to himself and was certainly not devoid of feeling . Under the apparent self-assurance of his Hilliard exterior lurked his own share of the universal cravingfor affection . Philip might have received a certain degree of love from his family , particularly from his mother , but theirs was not a demonstrative affection , and Philip , after all , was far from a subtle person . Without bitterness he was still inclined to wonder how many of his friendshipsp103were based on his position and money . Passionately literal , lie had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and classify as such . What had made him select Sybil , almost unhesitatingly , from the large number of more obviously attractive girls of his acquaintance was his strong sense , derived as early as their second meeting , of her devotion to him . When he thought of her , he thought of her brown brooding eyes and the pale intensity of her gaze . He felt , and felt correctly , that even her brusqueness was only the shell over her emotion . There was an enormous reassurance to Philip in this sense of a devotion that in no way depended on his future or even on his good character . With Sybil he could relax and be himself and still be loved . She accepted him just as promptly and just as gratefully as he had anticipated and hoped . They had a strange and rather wonderful evening together . They sat in the bar until the next intermission , and then Sybil went back to the box to get her coat . She greeted the astonished looks of her aunt and the others with a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had " met a friend . " They went to a night club and drank a bottle of champagne and walked back to Sybil 's house and sat for an hour in the library . Sybil had never taken anyone into the house this way before . She listened to Philip and knew each time just what he was going to say . What did it matter ? She could have listened to him forever . They decided upon an engagement of only two months . It was then the early spring of 1941 ; he was to graduate from law school in June . They planned to get married immediatelyafterwards and take the summer off before he went to midshipmen 's school on the U.S.S. Prairie State . They would take an apartment in New York where Philip intended to practice law after he got out of the service . He , of course , had planned it all out , and Sybil agreed to every/thing . Nobody could ever interfere with her again . She was in Philip 's hands . Early the next morning , after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she found her parents at breakfast . She announced her news triumphantly . " Philip and I are going to be married , " she said . " In the end of June . " Esther 's hands fell upon the newspaper in her lap . " Sybil , my child ! Do you mean it ? " " Philip who ? " cried her father . " Not Philip Hilliard ? " " We 'll get an apartment , " Sybil continued rather incoherently . " And he 's going to midshipmen 's school . You wo n't have to worry about us at all . And we want a small wedding . Very small . " Esther 's eyes were now wide with concern . " But , darling , we 'll do it any way you want , " she said . " You know that . But this is so sudden . You must give us a little time . "  --  There 's a war coming , " Sybil exclaimed defiantly , rememberingwhat Philip had said . " We ca n't wait . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weddings may be too hasty , " George murmured , feeling that he should say something . " Just tell me one thing , dear , " Esther went on , her eyes fastened upon her daughter . " Are you and Philip really sure ? Do you really love each other ? That , after all , is the only thing that matters . " Sybil stiffened . Whatever happened , she was determined not to allow the unbelievable happiness that seemed now actually within her grasp to be clouded by any association with her mother 's household gods . " What Philip and I feel about each other has got to be our own affair , Mummie , " she said resolutely . " That 's something that 's terribly important to me. "  |p105Her  father gaped at her . " Are you two different from the rest of humanity ? " he asked . " Are you somehow special ? " " Leave her be , George , " his wife said sharply . She turned back to Sybil . " If it 's important to you , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first talk , the first of many . Esther , who had taken the unhappiness of her daughter 's love affair with complete equanimity , was much more agitated by its suddenand joyful resolution . It was too quick , and Sybil was too excited . She had no faith in it . " I know it must be fun for her to walk in and tell us that she 's caught the most eligible bachelor in town , " she told George afterwards . " Certainly . That puts us in our place . But is it enough to base a marriage on ? " George was provoked by his wife 's way of regarding the whole problem as her own rather than his or even Sybil 's . " Do you think it 's impossible that they might be in love ? " he asked impatiently . " Ca n't you believe that anyone in your family can ever fall in love ? " George had been too surprised by Sybil 's engagement to be entirely pleased . It struck him at first as almost unfair that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldliness and who had resisted so passionately her family 's least effort to make her appear in the social world , should now be engaged , without any apparenttrouble , to the son and heir of the Hilliards . He was still smarting from a retort that she had made , only a few weeks before , in answer to his pointing out that she owed everything , her education and her bringing up , to the bank . " It was a mediocre education , " she had actually had the nerve to say , " and a less than mediocre bringing up . " He had always secretly hoped that she would marry a poor boy and learn about life the hard way , provided , of course , thatp106her Aunt Jo would allow it . And now , he reflected bitterly , y she would never understand . Still , when he considered , as he soon did , the impression that the news , confidentially dropped , would make on the fellow officers of his departmentat the bank that morning , he had to concede that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , was far from conscious of any compensations . Philip only stayed a few minutes with her the morning after his engagement because he had to fly back to Virginia . But the few minutes were enough for his purpose . " Darling , you 're out of your mind ! " she cried . " You do n't have to marry the girl because you think I was rude to her ! " " I thought you 'd take that attitude , " he retorted . " Everything'salways a joke to you and Lila and Felicia . Laughs , laughs , laughs . But this time I 'm serious , Ma . " " So am I serious ! " she exclaimed , pushing her breakfast tray from her knees so roughly that the dishes spilled on the bed . " Serious as hell ! I 've nothing against the girl . I really have n't . But let 's sleep on it . Shall we ? " " You sleep on it , " he said . " I 've got to go . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You ca n't catch these things too soon . " He left the room at this and did not come back even when she shouted after him . Lucy was frantic . She telephoned Lila and Felicia and got a certain amount of sympathy from them . But sympathy was not what she wanted . She wanted somebody to do something . In her desperation she even turned to her husband . He was down on Long Island , but she was driven there within an hour after Philip had left . She found him at the kennels when she arrived , and they talked it over as they stood by the wire netting and watched the puppies barking . Mr. Hilliard was unenthusiastic but undisturbed.  | " I suppose this girl has n't any money , " he said . Lucy shrugged her shoulders . " I would n't care if she had millions , " she retorted . " It 's that mousiness that I mind . And all the hate underneath it . " Mr. Hilliard continued his train of thought . " I know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him that summer that Philip went abroad with Teddy . I understand he 's not a bad sort of chap . On the cheap side , but gets around . His wife must have some money . " " No , no , " she said impatiently . " They 've been living off Jo Cummings for years . Everyone knows that . " Her husband brightened . " I 'd forgotten about Jo , " he said . " This girl 's Jo 's niece , is n't she ? I 've always liked Jo , you know . I used to go around with her crowd before I married you , my dear . And Stafford is a very substantial citizen . They 're one of our old families , you know . " Lucy stamped her foot . It was always this way with Seyinour , as with his sisters , in any question of marriage . They reverted immediately to anachronisms . " Old like the Third Avenue El , " she snapped . " Old in a cockroach sense . How can you be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself that this girl will ever see a penny of Stafford 's money . It all goes to that stuffed shirt of a son of his . " " Oh . I 'd forgotten about him . " " Well , he 's very much alive , " she retorted . " When Stafford dies , you 'll probably have to take over the support of the entire Rodman family . " " That will be Philip 's problem , " he said dryly . " Oh , Seymour , you can be exasperating . " " And you , my dear , take things too hard , " he said severely . " The girl ca n't be as bad as you make out . I remember herP108at that dinner you gave . Philip may be able to make somethingof her . Who knows ? " And then he went on to make a remark that showed how literally if not how feelingly he had kept abreast of modern thought . " And if it does n't work out , my dear , how much have we lost ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted the engagement with unqualifiedenthusiasm was Aunt Jo . Philip 's good looks and Sybil 's obvious infatuation appealed to the romantic in her , and the fact that he was a Hilliard was simply the final touch that made it all perfect . " Your mother does n't think money 's important , " she told Sybil when the latter called on her with the great news . " And it is n't , of course , compared to love . But when you 've got both , my dear , you 've got a lot . The world is yours , and do n't you forget it . " " But I would n't care if Philip did n't have a penny , Aunt Jo , " Sybil protested . " In many ways I 'd prefer it . " " I know you would , my dear , " Aunt Jo said , leaning over to give her hand a little pat . " And that 's fine , too . All I mean , child , is that everything about your engagement is perfect . Everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you picture their faces ! " " Oh , Aunt Jo , will I have to tell them ? I wo n't , will I ? " Her aunt burst out laughing . " Look at the child ! Scared already . No , dear , Philip will do that and take you to call . But you must n't be afraid of people any more , Sybil . Remember that . You 'll be a personage from now on . " After dinner that night Aunt Jo and her sister , Esther , met in the latter 's upstairs sitting room , filled with pink pincushionstools and clusters of family photographs , for thep109first serious discussion of the engagement . " You must be feeling triumphant , Esther , " Jo said in her bantering tone . " To have married off Sybil so splendidly . And without even trying , either . People are n't going to be able to get over this one . " Esther shrugged her shoulders . " It 's funny , is n't it , Jo ? " she said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An iceman , or something like that . " " Well , has n't she ? " " Perhaps . But she does n't know it . She 's so dazzled by this man that she thinks we all are . " " I thought we all were , " Jo said dryly . " Certainly George is . Esther 's silence conveyed the attitude of " Well , you know George . " " I ca n't make you out , Esther , " Jo continued . " Or what it is that you really want for your children . You bring them up in the world and expect them to be hermits . " " I do n't expect them to be hermits at all , Jo , " Esther retorted . " It 's simply that I do n't want them to be taken in . And Lucy Hilliard is somebody whom a girl like Sybil might take seriously . " " And should n't ? " Esther hesitated . " Well , Lucy may have her good points , " she conceded . " But that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sybil in . " " In ? Into what ? " " Why , into her whole ridiculous life , of course , " Esther said impatiently . " What else ? " " Sybil 's young , " Jo pointed out . " She may not find that life ridiculous . And if she does n't , it wo n't be ridiculous for her . At the moment it 's all fairyland . She 's met her prince . "  | " But I do n't approve of marrying princes , " Esther said , shaking her head . " I 'm enough of a snob for that . I 'm all for people staying in their stations . " Jo laughed . " You just do n't like Philip , Esther , " she said . " That 's what you 've got to face . " " I 've never known the Philips of this world very well , " Esther said reflectively . " They were the boys who never danced with me when I came out . " " We all have people like that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who make us feel inadequate . But is your Philip my Philip ? " " Certainly , " her sister answered . " And he 's Philip Hilliard . " " But if she 's in love with him , Esther ? " " Is she ? " This time Esther 's shrug was monumental . " How can I take that chance ? " Jo stared at her . Even she was unprepared for the full impact of her sister 's maternal egotism . " I might point out , Esther , " she exclaimed , " that it 's not you who 's taking it ! "  |p111THE  WEDDING itself , inevitably , reflected a blend of theodds of both families . Sybil , entirely conscious of the attitudenot only of her mother but of her prospective motheria-lawand quite indifferent to both , went about her family 's house in a dream and left the preparations to others . She would have preferred to have gone with Philip to a justice of the peace , and she would have suggested it had a fortunate instinct not warned her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was already aware , was confined to politics . The wedding , therefore , would come off more or less according to form , and Sybil , at first appalled at the prospect of the Hilliards being thrown together with her own parents , finally decided that it was perhaps , after all , only fitting that the long corridor of her childhood should come to an end in the stiff meaninglessness of a wedding reception . Beyond it all lay the garden of her adult years , and that , of course , was what counted . Her mother and Mrs. Milliard and Aunt Jo could play , if they wished , with weddingcake and invitations , like parents who , under a Christmastree , toy with the mechanical gadgets which they have given their children . Lucy Hilliard , however , was having a considerably betterp112time with the gadgets than her former classmate at Miss Heely 's School . To begin with , as mother of the groom , she had no direct responsibility for the success of the affair , and , secondly , she had decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she might as well get all the fun out of the wedding that she could . She was intrigued by Esther and by her worries ; she could not fathom the conscientiousness with which Sybil 's mother weighed every name on her list and wavered between brands of champagne , a conscientiousness that defeateditself at every turn , for if Esther 's first instinct was usually right , coming up as it did through the untroubled waters of her intelligence , her second , prompted by anxiety , was just as apt to be wrong . Thus her first list of guests , sensibly restricted to family , old friends and officers of the Cummings bank , became , after days of nervous contemplation , absurdly and hopelessly extended to include all the derelicts whom Esther thought it might be snobbish to omit , old maid companions of deceased aunts and odd , insecure women who might once have given Sybil piano lessons . It was as if Esther considered that the gods who watched her so jealously looked upon this wedding as the ultimate test of her salvation . Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she had , she could not have indulged in her game of going over the list daily , as it grew , and adding , for each new name of a former trained nurse of Uncle Stafford 's or an old tutor of Teddy 's , the names of some particularly boisterous couple from her own tough crowd . Esther , of course , was in no position to object ; she could only sit and chew her pencil and reflect sadly that in the end the party would probably not even fit into Jo 's big house . " You know , I have a kind of admiration for Esther , " Lucy told Viola Paton over an after-lunch brandy at the small French restaurant where they always lunched . " Imagine caring as she cares . Do you suppose you go to heaven for that sort of caring ? "  | " Of course not , " Viola answered . " It 's not goodness on their part . It 's the fear of doing wrong . Shall we have French champagne or domestic ? ' Will the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have spent too much money for my husband or too little for my daughter ? ' Where do you think those people go , Lucy ? " " Hell ? " Viola shrugged her shoulders . " They never know . They ca n't decide . " " Come to the wedding , anyway , Viola , " Lucy urged her . " It 'll be good for laughs . " But the wedding was not quite as odd as Lucy had thought it would be , for Jo Cummings , after all , was the person really in control , and nothing , even with Esther 's fussiness , could go too wrong in her well-run house . It was hot , as only Easton Bay could be hot in late June , but it did not rain , and the guests were able to move about on the big lawn and drink champagne under the marquee . Sybil had no attendants except Millie . Teddy , two weeks before the wedding , had told her that he and Millie were now definitelyengaged , and Sybil , full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this gesture . Philip , however , had fourteenushers , and with the exception of Teddy they were all large , self-assured Harvard athletes who walked on the balls of their feet . As she looked at them and at her mother , oddly overdressed , with big white feathers on a big brown hat and a drawn expression on her face , and at Teddy , perspiring and laughing and talking to everybody , and at her motherin-law , pumping hands violently with an old friend further down the receiving line , and at Aunt Jo , smiling over a huge orchid and moving her arms in time to the waltz music , she felt dizzy at the juxtaposition of her old life and her new . This is how they celebrate , she thought ; this is what they do , with their lace and their jokes and their champagne glasses and their kisses and their kindnesses ; it 's all very well forp114them , and I see now how nicely it 's meant  --  oh , how nicely  --  for where I was wrong was ever to resent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darling , " she said in Philip 's ear as she danced with him a few minutes later , when the receiving line had broken up , " it does n't have anything to do with us , does it ? " " You mean it does n't have anything to do with anyone else , " he answered . " I mean they could n't know how I feel about you ? " she continued . " They could n't or they would n't look that way . " " What way , Sib ? " " Oh , the way they do . Like sheep . " " Are they like sheep ? " She smiled and shook her head . He was such a comfort to her already , this husband who was part of them , whom she knew so well and who knew her so slightly . His very failure to understand her was a consolation ; she had a role to play now , and she would know how to play it , without the watcherswho knew her and knew when she was doing things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outplay them at it ; she was suddenly sure even of that . It was not hard , after all , if one was on one 's own . She looked confidently over Philip 's shoulder at his two older sisters who were talking to each other in a corner . There was nothing , really , that she could ever mind again , except the loss of this turbulent love that filled her , a love that was her own property , a love that would not even depend , queerly enough , on how Philip treated her or what he felt about her . It was a love , she thought , as they circled the floor , that had come between the jagged edges of life and her own sensitivity like a mat , a love that had drained life of its fear and made it so much more than endurable . I 'm happy , she thought in consternation ; I 'm actually , actually happy ! " Ellen , is n't it wonderful ? " she said , going over to wherep115Ellen , with a very red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing . " Ellen , darling , are n't you happy for me ? " she asked , kissing her . " Will you not be messing your dress , child , " Ellen reproachedher . And then , giving way to her emotion and hugging her , with tears in her eyes , she whispered : " Go back to the others , child . " " You 'll come to me , Ellen , when I 'm back , wo n't you ? You 'll look after my children ? " " You wo n't be wanting an old woman like me ! " " Promise me , Ellen ! Please promise me ! " " Go on with you . I promise . " Then there was Nicholas saying good-bye to her , stiffly but very nicely , and Aunt Jo giving her an overdemonstrative kiss , and dressing upstairs with Millie , who was very sisterly and constrained , and when she finally came downstairs and looked over the bannister at all the faces and the small clump of her girl friends , if one could call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly independent and sad at the same time , for the only face among the young people that she loved was Teddy 's and without thinking and to the amazementof all , she blew him a quick kiss and threw him the bouquet . Esther and her sister , Jo , sat smoking cigarettes on a weatherbeaten marble bench on the lawn , surveying the litter of strewn napkins and cigarette butts on the grass before them . Inside they could hear George speaking in a rather cross tone to the waiters , already engaged in the sorry task of reconstruction . Everyone had gone , and the sisters were drawn together by the great family bond that existed most intensely on the occasion of a wedding . For a few moments they could look together at Esther 's offspring withp116the detachment of a united older generation . " It 'll all go smash , Jo , " Esther said gloomily . " It 'll all go smash and then what ? " " In the first place , it wo n't , " her sister said , patiently and firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does , we 'll start over again . " " If I only thought that the child had a chance , " Esther continued , " I would n't mind so much . But she does n't know what 's happened to her . It makes me sick , Jo . Really it does . " " Esther , you 're too extreme . " Jo knew the strain that her sister had been under ; she was doing her best to be sympathetic . " You keep talking about Philip as if he were nothing but a wooden Indian . I could n't disagree with you more . I find him charming . But , after all , Sybil may like wooden Indians . You did . " Esther took this impassively . " But how is the wooden Indian , " she persisted , " going to like her ? " Jo , after all , had been under a strain herself . She was older than her sister , and she was tired . Her patience suddenlycollapsed . " You 're the most ungrateful woman I 've ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We ought both to be down on our knees giving thanks that Sybil has found anyonehalf as nice as that boy to share her life with . And what are we doing ? Talking about wooden Indians ! The trouble with you , Esther , is that you 're afraid to take a chance ! You 're afraid of life ! That 's what it is ! " " Whose life , Jo ? " " Your children 's . " But as they sat there , side by side , the afraid and the unafraid , they looked extraordinarily alike.  |p119SYBIL  in the years afterwards thought of her marriage and the war as having occurred simultaneously , and each event in retrospect took on some of the emotion with which the other was colored . Their honeymoon in Canada lasted for the whole summer ; in the early fall they moved to an apartment on the East River , and Philip went to Midshipmen 's School . He had to live on the U.S.S. Prairie State , moored in the Hudson , but he had liberty one night a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending up in prolonged visits to at least three of Philip 's favorite night clubs . They were extremely happy . Philip treated her almost as a child , instructing her with elaborate detail into the mysteries of married life . He had a particular way of his own for doing almost everything , from mixing a cocktail to arranging shirts in a drawer , and it was necessary that she should learn these things . But she was a willing pupil . In fact , she followed him blindly . When she heard of wives who were rude to their husbands or who bossed them about , she could only surmise that such marriages were miserable . Like many intellectualwomen she found delight in submission , in doing things for Philip , particularly in thinking about him when he was away at the school . The Navy had added anotherp120coating to the glistening exterior of his masculinity , and when he appeared in the doorway on those longed-for Saturdayafternoons , in his blue uniform , her heart would stop . " Did you get the seats for Holliday Pudding ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And reserve a table for six at the Crystal Roof ? " " Yes , Philip . " " And did you remember to telephone Ma about the underwear and pajamas that I left in Glenville ? " " I did . " " Good girl . You can have a kiss . " Philip was efficient ; he liked to do a lot of things , and he liked to do them well . He liked to read the newspapers , very carefully , and talk about politics ; he liked to exercise , and he liked to drink . He mapped out his days and nights with meticulous care and allotted his energy and his time neatly in accordance with his desires and ambitions . It was a simple matter for his wife to learn the pattern and , having learned it , to maintain it . With Philip beside her she was less shy at gatherings of his friends ; she talked more easily and learned to eliminate some of the bluntness that had startled people in her old self . Only if her husband was criticized did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't let the big boy get the harness over your neck , " Julia Anderton told her once . " Show him who the boss is . If you do n't , he 'll ride you . " " If he 'd ' wanted a bossy wife , Julia , I assume he 'd have taken you . " Julia stared . " Taken ! " she exclaimed . " What do you think we are ? A harem ? " Her family gave her no trouble . Millie called occasionally and gushed over the apartment , but it was obvious that shep121did not really like it . It was too much larger than the one that she and Teddy were planning to take to be in the category of younger marrieds ' apartments and hence could not be fussed about in the same way . Millie could be impressed by things a little bigger and better than her own , but not doubly so . Besides , Sybil and Philip had taken the apartment furnished because of the uncertainty of the future . They had stored all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and George were pleasant enough to Philip , and he was exceedingly polite to them , but they saw little of each other . George admired Philip 's being an athlete and a " regular fellow , " but , like Millie , he was a little too impressed with the Hilliards to relax with them . The big event of the autumn was Teddy 's marriage to Millie . All the family except Sybil considered her a " perfect " girl , and a great amount of enthusiasm was demonstrated . Millie was quiet and sweet and intensely feminine ; it was assumed that she would be practical , too , and keep Teddy 's head " out of the clouds , " as George put it , without making him feel that he was missing anything there . She could be counted on , in short , to carry on the maternal good work and to see that Teddy , whose imagination had always seemed dangerously open to romantic ideas , became a lawyer , a father and a family man . Esther could turn her son over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a receipt and release . In the immediate future , however , it would be her duty to share Esther 's burden of worry , for Teddy , like his brother-in-law , was a midshipman on the Prairie State and would , in all probability , be sent to sea . Worry to Esther was like a pagan sacrifice ; the more relatives who joined in it , the more were the gods propitiated . " I know you 'll like her , Sib , " Teddy told her , " when you get to know her better . " " Will I ? "  | " And if not , what of it ? I 'm not going to be one of those husbands who insists that everybody love his wife . You and I go way back , Sib . Nothing can break that . " She frowned . " Does she like the books we like ? " " Lord no ! " He laughed . " Does Philip ? " She had nothing to say to this . She had nothing , indeed , constructively critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring herself to tell him that Millie , for all her feminine helplessness , real as well as assumed , had trapped him . For what could have been easier game for a seemingly helpless girl than Teddy who , under his high spirits and exuberant charm , was so impressionable and obliging ? Even Esther confided to Sybil that she had a dim suspicion of this . She was always badgering Teddy with questions about his happiness . One day he turned on her with an unprecedented sharpness and snapped : " I 'm getting married , Mummie . Do I have to be ecstatic too ? Will you never be satisfied ? " " What do you suppose he meant ? " Esther , appalled , asked Sybil afterwards . " Did I say something wrong ? " " I suppose he wanted to be let alone , " Sybil suggested . " People can be happy and unhappy at the same time , ca n't they ? " " Can they ? " Esther 's voice was filled with dismay . " It sounds too queer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have none . She met each new friend or relation of the Rodmans ' with an attitude of " I just know we 're going to like each other , " expressed with many smiles and a good deal of wriggling of her shoulders . When Millie shook hands , nervously and jerkily , she seemed to be pumping her desire to please into the other person . Even Sybil had to admit that if ever a girl had tried to be nice , it was Millie . And all she wanted , too , as Philip had once told her , were the things that every girl wanted : a home and children and thep123security afforded by a moderately industrious husband in an ordinary job . But Sybil wanted Teddy to have what she had ; she resented as much as ever anything that smacked of compromise . At the church she watched the ceremony with a lump in her throat , her arm under that of her husband to whom she had confided none of her doubts . Philip lived in a different world ; it was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the dampness of her worries . She was already pregnant , too , and bore his world within her . Yet as she listened to her brother 's clear responses at the altar , she felt again the old urge to protect him from the world . It was too late . After the wedding came Pearl Harbor . He and Philip were transferred to the west coast , and Philip was sent to the Pacific to join a light cruiser as a communications officer . The interminable war years with all their consequences and lack of consequence had begun.  |p124PHILIP  was in the Pacific for the first three years of the war . During all of this time , except for an occasional spell of shore duty in Pearl Harbor , he was at sea . He came home on leave only once , for three weeks , in 1943 and saw his son , Seymour , called " Timmy , " who had been born in his absence . He was proud of the boy and glad , in his way , to see Sybil , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some constraint . When he flew back to the coast afterwards , it was not so much with a feeling of relief as with a feeling that he had not had quite the fun to which he was entitled . He was not , however , wholly clear in his own mind as to what this fun should consist of. a Sybil had been , needless to say , devotion itself , but Sybil had changed . She had changed , in many ways , for the better . The expression of intensity in her eyes was still there , as was the determination somehow inherent in her paleness , but one no longer was troubled by the sense that she had formerly conveyed , of a dog ready to snap . She was calm and even graceful . She was almost , in fact , serene . Her evolution from the cocoon of her earlier resentments had , oddly enough , been quickened by Philip 's long absence . She had missed him terribly , but she had learned to livep125with the emptiness . Had he been home she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had the baby and her war work and was responsible only to herself . She went eight hours a day to the Red Cross information service and interviewed families who had not heard from their boys overseas . It was the kind of work that she would have been far too shy even to think of in the past . Esther observed her daughter 's improvement with appreciation and skepticism . " There 's nothing like a hero in the family , " she pointed out to Millie . " Particularly when he 's away . " Sybil 's relations with her family-in-law had also taken a decided turn for the better . Despite the coldness of her initial reception , she had made a great effort with all of the Hilliards , even cultivating the maiden aunts to prove to herself how entirely she had merged her life with Philip 's . She called upon Miss Emily and Miss Harriet every other Saturday and almost persuaded herself that beneath the perpetual fountain of their complaints was hidden at least the semblance of a human need to love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? " Philip 's sister , Lila , asked her mother . " Could anyone really like the aunts ? " " Good Lord , no ! " Lucy raised her hands at the very idea . " Give her credit for something ! She 's playing a game . These quiet little girls are the ones that get ahead . All the rest , residue and remainder of my estate to Miss Mouse . ' I wish I had a dollar for every time I 've seen that in the papers . " She nodded her head , in grudging admiration . " More power to the girl . She 's got the right idea . You and Felicia are too lazy to go near the old dragons . For all you care , they could leave their money to a dog-and-cat hos-pital ! " " But you never go near them yourself , Ma . " " Well , they 're certainly not going to leave anything to me , " Lucy retorted . " Why should I be bothered ? But you'rep126their own flesh and blood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it . " Sybil found it far easier to get along with her sisters-inlawthan she had anticipated . Lila and Felicia were big , handsome , indolent girls , without a trace of their mother 's malice , who could spend the entire morning discussing nail polish and the entire afternoon shopping for it . Their husbandsand children seemed to take up very little of their time , and they lunched or had cocktails with Lucy every day in the week . Oddly devoid of energy , they never demonstratedthe least dissatisfaction with their rather inert existences . " They 're like cows , " Philip used to say disgustedly , " except they do n't give milk . " They looked upon Sybil , withoutenvy , as an intellectual , and came to accept her point of view unquestioningly in every field that had not been previously covered by their mother 's . Arlina , the youngest sister , who was still at school , a large , emotional , messy girl , was ecstatic to find a sister-in-law so quiet and sympathetic . She developed a crush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Lucy , however , that Sybil made her most importantconquest . The war had given Lucy a needed outlet for her energies , and she was a changed woman . It was , of course , her war , but as even she could not be allowed to run it all , she chose prisoners of war as her specialty . She became the head of a large office that sent parcels to our soldiers and sailors in enemy hands ; she worked indefatigablythe whole day and often at night . All of her tumultuous abilities , long scattered in parties and travel and loose , easy , rough talk became centered in her job . She talked of nothing but the war and excoriated those who , in her opinion , were not doing their share , even to the point of shaming George Rodman into volunteering for one night a week of guard duty on the piers . In the flurry of her activity , she became increasingly impatient with the inertia of her hus/band and daughters , and Philip , her only child in uniform , seemed more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The least that she could do , while he was fighting in the Pacific , was to be nice to his wife , and in this way she made the discovery of Sybil 's better side . She was delighted to find that her daughter-in-law , like herself , was busy in war work , and she began to include her in those daily lunches at the French restaurant which , even with all her new activity , Lucy never discontinued . Gradually she and her friend Viola came to discover the intelligence under Sybil 's reserve and the dry humor that was beginning to take the place of her truculence . " But she 's absolutely marvelous ! " Lucy exclaimed after lunch one day to Viola . " I had no idea ! " She was always ready to admit that she had been wrong . Lucy was not a small woman . " Did you really know you had a jewel , darling ? " she asked Philip when he came home on leave . " Or was it blind luck ? " Philip , to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspectedit , either , from Sybil 's letters which had made him slightly uncomfortable . He had been very conscious of their note of intellectualized sentiment ; he had felt vaguely that they were unusual and had not altogether liked it . Sybil 's devotion , when he was with her , expressed in her large , steady stare , was gratifying and reassuring ; he could put an arm protectingly over her shoulders and continue easily talking to his friends . But Sybil 's devotion expressed in her neat , concise handwriting and coming to him in never failingpages across the broad , hot Pacific seemed too set apart from the simple standards of the men around him . The letters of the sailors that he read as a ship 's censor , filled with erotic , misspelled reminiscences of physical intimacy , seemed destined for wives very different from his . He was not sure in what vein he wanted her to write him , but certainlyin an earthier one than the letter which he received when she heard of his shrapnel wounds.  | " It is so unbelievable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that there could be people in this world who would fire on a ship that you were aboard . You tell me that it was nothing but a scratch , and I pray that you are not just trying to reassure me , but even a scratch  --  how could they want to ? To do it to you ? These are the things that it is impossible for me to believe as I sit in my office before my file cards , looking down on Madison Avenue and watching the people walk up and down , the people who are n't in the Pacific and who think of the war , if at all , with a shudder and then tell themselvesthat it is n't so bad if you 're really in it , the way people who catch fish tell themselves it 's all right because a fish does n't feel . When it gets too bad for me I go across the street to call on your mother amid her ringing telephones and scurrying assistants , and I admire her activity and cherish the consolation that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , wondering a little why so many men must die that Lucy Hilliard may be redeemed . Little Timmy is just like you and such a comfort . Please , please get well , darling , and come home . Without you I 'm back in the darkness and understand nothing . " To this Philip answered that the shrapnel wounds had come from splinters of shells fired by his own ship and that they had not even been bad enough to keep him in sick bay . He had been relieved of watches for a few days and assigned to duty on the ship 's court-martial board . The rest of the letter described this experience in the turgid style of the young lawyer : " To think that I never expected to practise law and now find myself a judge ! Not that you should picture me in the sober black usually associated with judicial garb . I sit , on the contrary , with two of my worthy brothers arrayed in khaki shirts open at the neck behind a simple wardroom table before which our trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or missed muster ? Woe betide him ! " Sybil did not feel that such letters had very much to do with herself , and she noted the style even as she told herself that she did n't , but , still , he was writing from a new and wonderful world , the world , and if anything came out of it that did not tally with her standards , then her standards were the ones that would have to be changed . When he came home on leave after a year and a half of duty in the Pacific and four major battles , with ribbons and stars , and only a little less hair and a little more weight , she was almost frightened at the intensity of her own happiness , even if she was troubled , deep down , at the prospect of having to work out a different relationship . For she was very much aware , and she knew from some of his letters that he was aware , too , how little they had really known each other before the war . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fussed over , and she knew that he would want to see his friends . She decided that it would be best if they did not go off alone , but if they spent his leave , instead , in New York and in Glenville where she could share him with Lucy and his sisters . This turned out , fortunately , to be just what he wanted . For the first few days there was an inevitable self-consciousness between them , but this was soon relieved by cocktail parties and dinners where Philip was featured , and after a bit they settled down to what seemed to Sybil their new relationship of his telling her about life on his cruiser and of her laughing at his jokes . Philip had really not changed at all . If anything , he had rather enjoyed the Navy , although , like all reserve officers , he would rather have died than admit it . She was still attractive to him , and he adored the baby . What then was wrong ? Was it only the long months between , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying asp130they could be wonderful ? Or was it  --  as she uneasily felt  --  that she herself had changed , that she had become a more forceful , a more coherent and communicative person than Philip had known before , a person who could not quite be smothered even in their most intimate moments ? She saw this person in the mirror on her dressing table as she was getting ready for dinner on the last night of his leave ; she made out the new confidence in her eyes and in the face that loomed at her over the big stoppers on the perfume bottles , and she saw , too , the tears that appeared suddenly in her eyes , tears that she could not be once again the silent , clinginggirl whom he had loved enough to marry , against all of his family . But she was growing up ; it was a process that could not be retarded . She put on her earrings ; she placed a drop of perfume behind each ear ; she went to take a final look at the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOARDED his plane for the West Coast it was not with a feeling of unrelieved gloom . He knew that he would have to wait in San Francisco for his orders anywherefrom a day to a month . He liked San Francisco , however , very much , and he had not told Sybil that he might be delayed there . He felt rather guilty about this on the flight out , particularly as she believed everything that he told her so implicitly , but he reasoned with himself that , after all , he might be there for only a day in which case she would have taken the trip for nothing . He knew , of course , that she would have been happy to take the chance , but then there was the baby to consider , and was it really such a good idea to leave little Timmy with Mrs. Rodman , who was such a fusser , or even , for that matter , with his own mother ? Besides , there was himself to consider . He had been fighting the war and risking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . A man in his situation needed more than the relaxationthat even a devoted wife could give . He was fond of Sybil , of course ; he loved her , indeed , but he had many navy friends in San Francisco , with their wives , and they were n't Sybil 's type at all . They thought nothing of sitting up andp132drinking all night , and there were other things that they took a good deal less seriously than Sybil did . The long and short of it , he decided , was that Sybil was the perfect peacetimewife . But hell , this was war . By the time he arrived in San Francisco he felt almost reconciled to his own rationalizations . There were several officers from his cruiser who , like himself , were awaiting transportation , and the life was very much what he had so cheerfully anticipated . His only duty was to report every morning at eleven to see if his orders had come , which gave to the rest of the day the pleasant quality of a possibly final day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fit of remorse and told her that she probably would n't be hearing from him again . He implied that orders were imminent . f " Oh , darling , " she said . " To think that I might have had three days more of you . But anyway . Good luck , dearest . " z On the fourth day he met Irene Hodges . She was quite a bit older than he , and her husband was attached to Philip 's cruiser , but he was not in San Francisco . He was at sea . Irene was a large , graceful , blond woman with a perpetual smile and disconcerting eyes . She told Philip , not once but several times , that she and her husband believed that what one did while the other was away was none of the other 's business . He always started his evenings at Irene 's apartment , drinking a great many cocktails and listening to her calm and outrageous flattery . It pleased him even though he knew how often she used it on others . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him one evening as he sat looking into his cocktail glass which he was holding between his knees . " About the dear little wife and the dear little boy back home ? Oh , poor handsome . Poor lonely handsome . Let Irene fix him another drink . " She made no effort to move from the sofa on which shep133always lay stretched , perfectly still . She never took her eyes off him . He got up and poured another drink for each of them . " As a matter of fact , I was just thinking that I have n't been thinking about them , " he said . " Not enough , that is . " " And what good does thinking about a woman do her ? " Irene retorted . " Can she tell whether or not you 're thinking about her ? Of course , she ca n't . If you want to keep her happy , write . That 's the only thing that counts . Obbie always writes . " Obbie was her husband , and her voice softened a bit as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know he 's not thinking of me . But I think he 's a million angels to write . And I love him for it . " " He does n't write such a hell of a lot , " Philip pointed out . She looked quizzical for a moment . Then she laughed . It was a long , easy laugh . " Oh , you darling , " she said . " You have to read each other 's mail , do n't you ? Censorship . Of course . It must be so cozy . I can just see you , my handsome lieutenant , with all your Chelton background and your inhibitions about peeping , finally released into an absolute heaven of other people 's business . " She clapped her hands . " Oh , it 's divine ! You know it 's divine ! " " We only read the outgoing mail , " Philip said with dignity . " Not the incoming . " She laughed louder . " Oh fiddle ! " she exclaimed . " I 'll bet you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of in the morning . Why , Mr. Hilliard ! " They looked at each other and smiled . It was a long pleasant smile . She knew that he had turned the corner , at just that moment , and that their friendship was about to enter a new phase , the one towards which she had been slowly , and even lazily , directing it . He knew that she knewp134it , and she knew this too . There was no hurry . At the end of their smile she laughed again . " If it does n't matter what a man thinks , " Philip pointed out , " it ca n't matter too much what he does . If his wife does n't know , that is . " " No , Socrates . " " But it is n't really true that I do n't think of Sybil , " he said defensively . " I think of her a lot . Except maybe not in the right way . " " My poor handsome puritan , " she said , shaking her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an angel . Of course , she 's pining for you . Of course , she 'd cry her little eyes out if she could peek into your big bad mind . But remember , my handsome , that she is n't going to have the chance . Unless you 're more of a puritan than I think you are . Unless you tell . " Philip said nothing to this , but after a moment he moved over to her side on the sofa . There were still doubts , there were even inhibitions , but when he put his arms around her and sensed the quick , assured possessiveness of her response , he knew that he had left the quiet subtlety of Sybil 's world for the world of the censored letters . It was his first infidelity . When he left , ten days later , for the Pacific , his sense of guilt had already disappeared , and he was feeling as relaxedas , in his opinion , a serviceman was entitled to feel . Irene had been perfect and their affair without sentiment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him some embroidered handkerchiefs to take to Obbie on the cruiser . On the transport to Pearl Harbor he did a good deal of consciousand unconscious comparing of her with Sybil . He worked himself almost into the position of putting the blame on his wife for what had happened . A man , after all , expectedsomething more than the submissiveness that Sybilp135offered . And why not ? He had rather a desire , as Irene had foreseen , to write her about the whole thing . In this , however , he managed to restrain himself . She was a Rodman , and one could never be entirely sure how Rodmans would take things or what they would do.  |p136TEDDY  WAS SENT to the Pacific early in the war as was Philip , but because of the need of shore-based communicationsofficers of his training , he was not sent to sea . He spent instead the first six months in Pearl Harbor and thereafterwas transferred from atoll to atoll as they were captured . At first he was disappointed not to be at sea , like Philip , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensations around him . He even learned to enjoy the Quonset hut life on those small sandy islands surrounded by the shimmering blue of the Pacific . It was a regular and peaceful existence , with enough whiskey if one was an officer , in an atmosphere that was entirely youthful and masculine , with none of the problems presented by women and children , by old age and disease . He knew better , of course , than to write any of this to Millie who , like Sybil , was nursing her first child ; his letters to her were carefully explicit as to his loneliness . To his mother , however , he once tried to convey some sense of the odd pleasures in the life that he was leading , but Esther , immediately and unreasonablyseeing a threat to his marriage in such an attitude and terrified that Millie might in some way suspect their illicit correspondence , made no reference in her answer top137any of his comments but inundated her letters instead with unsolicited details of Millie and the baby and Millie 's dear little apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and being greeted with the chill of its unwelcome domesticityTeddy was still able to smile as he traced the anxiety of his mother 's scratchy handwriting and read between the lines her gentle reproach that he must not pretend to like the atoll existence , that New York was where his interests lay and would he please not forget it ? Good old mother , he said to himself ; she thinks I 'll be a Gauguin , after all . And then he wrote her a proper letter , giving her full details of his health , and another to Millie , full of plans for their future , and after these he could let himself go in a letter to Sybil , who always understood . " I never get tired of sitting in the evening outside my Quonset hut and looking down over the beach and the sea . Particularly if there 's a squall coming up , for then as the clouds roll over and the sea becomes white-capped and the palm trees begin to blow I feel the exciting calm of being on a tiny spot in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the men here have no sense of the immensity of the surrounding vacancy ? I read Spengler and Brooks Adams and feel relieved at the sense of distant decline . Yet how they talk , all around me , of girls and home towns , of shoes and ships and sealing-wax . ' Of cabbages but never of kings . " His life , of course , was not as inert as he made it sound . There was a great deal to do , and Teddy did things efficiently . His capacity for enthusiasm included even the military , and his sense of drama could feed on the picture of organized discipline and sacrifice in the Pacific . But the great difference in Teddy 's life was the impersonality of the Pacific and the people fighting in it . He had brought himself up , after all , in the school of his own charm and its effect on people . " It seems almost , " Sybil wrote him , " as though we hadp138changed places in life . It makes me feel inadequate when I think how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be for even a touch of the kind of sympathythat you can give . And where are you ? Marooned on a sea-girt atoll in the comparative solitude that was alwaysmy ideal ! How will it all end , Teddy ? Will you come home and lock yourself in your room and refuse to go to dances ? And will I be everyone 's favorite ? And will either of us be happier ? " Teddy smiled at her unexpressed thought that the change in their positions was at least doing him good . They had never really trusted him . Any of his family . Sybil had always been afraid that he would become a philistine , and hisparents had trembled that he would n't . Well , perhaps theywere both right . At any rate , he could n't be too concerned . The family seemed small and shrill from the vantage point of his Pacific isolation . When Philip 's cruiser was in Eniwetok he and Teddy met at the officers ' club . They sat all afternoon at a board table under a thatched roof and drank beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail . He assumed that Teddy , being shore-based , would have nothing himself to say . Later , however , and after many beers their conversationbecame more personal . Philip , who was always naively candid , ended by telling Teddy the whole San Francisco episode . It was , perhaps , an odd confidence to make to a brother-in-law , but Teddy had always listened to him with sympathy in the past . Teddy 's reaction , however , was not what he had hoped . He looked at Philip in a very odd way . " You 're shocked , " Philip said irritably . " I should n't have told you . " Teddy thought this over for a moment before he answered . The only thing that surprised him was that he was shocked .   " I guess I am , Phil , " he said . " I guess I still feel protective about Sib . " " But this sort of thing has nothing to do with Sybil , " Philip protested . " It does n't affect her one way or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Teddy nodded slowly . " I 've always gone along with you in these things , Phil , " he conceded . " That 's true . I 've always gone along with all my friends . Maybe I 'm just beginning to be stuffy . " He suddenly laughed . " But do you know something , Phil ? I want to be stuffy . " He looked at his brother-in-law , whom he had always so admired , as if he were seeing him for the first time . He had spent , it sometimes seemed to him , a veritable lifetime with no moral existence outside of his fondness for other people . If Philip was his friend , then Philip could do no wrong . No real wrong . But people had got him nowhere and never would get him anywhere . What , after all , was the use of them ? Philip , however , only blinked at him . " You mean , you think I 'm a heel ? " he asked belligerently . Teddy , looking at him , laughed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I suppose you are , more or less , a heel . " Philip grunted . " I suppose you would n't cheat on Millie if you had a chance , " he said nastily . " I suppose you 'd be a little tin Jesus . " Teddy , looking out at what seemed the infinity of ships in the atoll , reflected that Philip was genuinely incapable of thinking that anyone was different from himself . " I . suppose I would , Phil , " he said . When they went back to their respective quarters that night Teddy was able to push another of his childhood gods off the mantel . His hearth , indeed , was now quite coveredp140with their pieces , and he slept well . Philip , on the other hand , slept fitfully in his bunk and dreamed of Sybil fixing him with reproachful eyes . His mother was laughing , and so was Irene ; there were many laughs in his dream . But Sybil was not laughing . As he awoke in the morning to the clanging bells of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , helmet in hand , he shook off the dream with impatience and anger . It was a world of men and things in which he lived . The real Philip had nothing to do with the strange squeamishness of his wife 's brother . He wrote Teddy , weeks later , in a cheerful vein , after a good deal of postponement and after the cruiser had left Eniwetok , without mentioning their dispute . To mention it at all would have been to make too much of it . He received a pleasant answer , entirely noncommittal and full of Teddy 's general thoughts about the progress of the war . Like many of the letters which he received from friends , even in the boredom of shipboard life , Philip never quite finished it . Not long afterwards he received an overdue transfer ; he was detached from his cruiser and ordered to Washington for duty in the Navy Department . After three years in the Pacific this was welcome news , and he wrote Sybil and told her to look for a house in the capital and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told himself , that he might stop off for a few days in San Francisco on his way home.  |p141DURING  THE LAST WINTER of the war Philip and Sybil occupied a small house in Georgetown . No effort had been spared by Lucy Hilliard to make Philip 's life comfortable . ' As soon as the letter had arrived announcing his change of duty she had gone with Sybil to Washington to look at real estate . Having found no suitable house for rent , Lucy had promptly bought one . " It 's a good investment , anyway , " she told her astonished daughter-in-law . " And what the heck ? After three years out there he deserves it . Even if you live in it only a week . Give him fun , dear . " Sybil kissed her . Their relations now were very good indeed . When Philip arrived she was already settled in the house with Timmy , now three years old , a delicate , sensitive child who showed signs of resembling his uncle , Teddy . Much as Sybil adored her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not diminished , in any degree whatsoever , the intensity of her preoccupation with Philip . She did not see , at the moment , how she was to do justice to both of them . Philip , however , was delighted with everything , including his son , and Sybil could hardly bring herself to believe that it had really happened and that he was really home . Her cup , it seemed , was filled to overflowing . It wasp142a pity that no Rodman could regard such a prospect without foreboding . Philip was excellent at perfunctory things , and his mannerswere undeniably good . There may have been somethingmethodical in his fairness , but nonetheless it was fairness . If he and Sybil , for example , dined one night with old classmates of his to reminisce about events in which she had no part , he was careful to suggest the following night that they do something that was fun for her . She never held him to this , and she suspected that she was not meant to , but , still , he made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared about . What Philip was actually doing , of course , was building up credit against the day when he might need it . He had resumed his relations with Irene on his return to the West Coast , and he had used up a week of his leave before coming to New York . It had all been fun , but it was over  --  at least for the time being  --  and it was obvious that he should now give some attention to his marriage . Philip wanted his home life to be independently fortified ; he was learning to disconnect it in his mind from his occasional diversions . As a matter of fact , he even reasoned to himself at his desk in the Pentagon , the second phase of his affair in California had washed away the resentment that he had been developingagainst Sybil and had made their reunion a good deal easier than he had anticipated . Much of the strain on him had gone when he had lost his fear of being confined for life to one woman . Sybil , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother of his child ; it was almost pathetically easy to keep her satisfied . If he got restless in the future there would be business trips and excursions and all that these implied . There was no reason to rock the boat . He was not very busy at the Navy Department . Nobody expected too much of Pacific veterans . He was a lieutenant commander now and looked very impressive at his desk be/hind his ribbons and battle stars . When he got home a little after five he was still full of energy and wanted either to go out or to have people in . Sybil complied as best she could , but she knew nobody in Washington , and it ended with Philip 's collecting a somewhat heterogeneous circle of navy friends and friends of his family 's . The latter were largely New York businessmen and lawyers who were working for the government in a civilian capacity . Their wives , as might have been expected from Lucy 's circle , were apt to be hard and thin and entirely sophisticated ; they dazzled Philip who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he denounced it . Sybil knew this and could still be amused by it . She also noted that his " liberalism , " his whole interest in politics , in fact , had melted with the first rays of a Pacific sun . " You spent all last evening with Laura Ingraham , " she pointed out one day at breakfast . " I thought you would want to talk to Alfred Kay about the paper he wants to start when the war 's over . I kept trying to edge him over to you , but you were like a waiter . I could n't catch your eye . " Philip was buried in the newspaper . " I was looking at Laura , " he said gruffly . " You 'll have to admit that she 's easier to look at than Alfred . " " Certainly . If that 's what you want . " He glanced at her over the top of the paper . " What do you mean , if that 's what I want ? " She shrugged her shoulders . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to Alfred , " she said . " I ca n't conceive of it the other way round . " He looked at her with a funny little smile . " L'aura , my sweet , " he said , " is a very attractive woman . " She did not pursue the subject , but she was aware thatthe subjects were increasing that she did not pursue . Shewas just beginning , after the first months of their reunion ,  |p144to  realize what she had suspected even prior to his return : that they did not really have a relationship at all . The idea broke in on her gradually , and she refused to be panicked by it . If there was no relationship , it was up to her to construct one . She saw that he wanted her to be more sophisticated . She knew that she could never be bold and languid like Laura , but she could be quiet and controlled and could make her fewer words felt . She sensed that Philip no longer wanted her to be clinging , and she tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were alone . It was difficult , but it was absorbing , and it kept her from being what he called " sticky . " She paid more attention to her clothes , and even Philip noticed this . " You know you really look well tonight , " he said to her once as she was coming downstairs in a new black evening dress . She could always tell when he meant something . " I 'm proud of you . " " Do I look as well as Laura ? " " Like Laura 's daughter . " " As old as that ? " He gave her a little tap on the chin with his fist . It was a small , playful gesture , but it was something that he had not done since before the war . She was suddenly trembling . " Oh , Philip , " she said and hurried past him into the car so that he should not see the tears in her eyes . It was only at such moments that she realized how far things were from what she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the unbelievable events of the atom bomb and the Japanese surrender . Philip got out of the Navy in the fall , and they went to Bermuda and then back to their apartment in New York . The house in Georgetown was sold , as Lucy had anticipated , at a profit , and the Washington interlude was over . Sybil was honest enough to admit to herself that the war had been something of a romance to her . She had been wretchedly worried aboutp145Philip , of course , while he had been in the Pacific and lonely as even she had never been lonely before , but at least there had been exaltation . Whatever there was in her life now , there was certainly very little of that . She was disappointed when Philip went to work as a vicepresidentof the family company which held the real estate in the city that comprised the bulk of the Hilliard fortune . He announced it to her only after the final decision . " It 's not a permanent thing , " he explained when he saw her expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well learn where the chips come from . " " But , darling , you wo n't even be using your legal training , " she protested . " It seems so  --  well , so stodgy . And you 're not stodgy , Philip . " " Certainly , I 'll be using my law , " he said , bridling . " Real estate 's nothing but law . Evictions and rent control and sales and multiple-dwelling statutes . As a matter of fact , I doubt if I could handle the job if I were n't a lawyer . You just do n't know what you 're talking about , Sib . " Very likely she did n't . She was ready to concede this . It did , however , seem to be part of a pattern that he had once repudiated . She knew how irritating it was to be reminded of an outgrown idealism and said nothing further . But what was far more disappointing to her was that he did not want another child , at least not then . In Washington he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go back to the Pacific and be killed , and he did n't want to leave her more tied down than she was . Now he claimed that it would be better to wait for a year until things had " settled down . " Sybil minded this very much , but , as usual , she gave in . Lucy knew of her disappointment , for the Hilliards discussed everything among each other . She tried to cheer her up . " Do n't worry , dear , " she told Sybil . " I know the Hilliard men . He 'll come around . It 's hard for us to understand how much the war has upset him . I know he does n't lookp146it , but it 's still there , down deep . Where it does n't show . " So Sybil resigned herself to their new life . When she found herself insufficiently occupied , for she had Ellen to look after Timmy , and a cook , she returned to her history , but she made it a more active hobby than before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grey , as the subject for an essay biography . The field was free from intrusion , and she spent many hours in the Public Library extracting what material there was on her rather shadowy subject and making herself an expert in the problems of the English succession . Her final result , ruthlessly synthesized , was a paper of less than fifty pages . Philip discovered it on the living-room table one night and read it carefully while she was out of the room . He had never heard of the subject , but he praised it in his extravagant , uncritical way and talked of taking it to a friend of Lucy 's who ran a literary magazine . For once in her life she was abrupt with him . " I must do these things in my own way , Philip , " she said sharply , taking back the manuscript . " If they 're not perfect , they 're nothing . " She noticed that at cocktail parties Philip always singled out a particular girl to talk to , but as it was apt to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her to worry . In fact , the idea that she might lose him altogether , as so many wives in the post-war period had lost their husbands , was inconceivable to her . There were no divorces in her family . Such things only happened to other people . Millie and Teddy , for example , seemed to have readjusted smoothly to each other . Millie had had her second baby , and Teddy was working in a large law firm and working very hard . But he seemed to like it and was even boring on the subject of his bond issues . They lived in a small house in Greenwich that Aunt Jo had bought for them . People worked things out . They were all adult now , Sybil reflected , a bit ruefully , and they had to solve their own problems . It was what life was . P147THE BUSINESS with Julia Anderton started one evening towards the end of the first post-war winter while Sybil was in Greenwich spending the night with Teddy and Millie . She and Philip had been asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needless to say , had been no deterrent to Sybil 's excursion . " Why do n't you go anyway ? " she asked Philip that morning . " After all , she was an old girl of yours . It would be kind . " " Oh , I imagine Julia 's done well enough without me . " " She has n't married , " Sybil pointed out . " She 's probably still pining for you . " It was , in fact , a surprise to everyone that Julia had not married . She was the adored only child of a timid , nervous couple who had had just enough money to give her the same disadvantages that richer girls enjoyed . Julia 's coming-out party , in a few hours , had wiped out the savings of ten years . But she had come out , and there had been champagne and men to park the cars and inferior toasts and a dancing team from a night club whom nobody had watched . Julia herself had carried it all off with a commendable bravado . Since then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , to show for it now but her manner , thatp148rough and superior carelessness that went so well with her big limbs , her big but excellent figure , her large , firm nose and long , tawny hair . It may have been an overdoseof this casualness , combined with the frankness and occasional unheeding vulgarity of her talk , that put men off . Julia had always been in the center of things , but wives , apparently , were chosen from the perimeters . The cocktail party , at her parents ' gloomy apartment , filled with shapeless stuffed chairs and dark lithographs , in a shabby building on Madison Avenue , like all of Julia 's cocktail parties , was only the accumulation of her married friends . One should break away , she thought with discouragement , as she looked about her . There was no future in this . Life gave a girl only a few years in which to marry ; afterwards she was swept on remorselessly in the ineligible company of her more successful contemporaries . She went over to confer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Less vermouth on the next round , " she told him . " And do n't keep giving people new glasses . Fill up their old ones . " How they jabbered , she thought irritably , as she turned back to the living room . Now that they had left their babies in competent hands and their apartments neat and clean , they could put on their cute little party dresses and join their husbands at Julia 's , poor , dear , irresponsible Julia 's , and drink too many cocktails . After all , it was all right for them ; it happened so rarely and they worked so hard , but poor Julia . . . well , what did Julia do all day ? " What a nice apartment this is , Julia , " one of them was saying to her ; " it must be wonderful to live here . You know , I forget sometimes , since I 've been married , how well our parents do live . " " Julia , you 'll forgive me if I rush off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When are you coming to see your godson , Julia ? He keeps asking for Auntie Hoolia ' now . "  |p149Damn  them all , she breathed to herself . Were they trying to hurt her ? They looked her straight in the eye and dared her to say that she was bored by their children . They knew she would n't . How well they knew ! She saw Philip come in . " No wifey ? " she asked him . " Everybody here has a little wifey . You 'll be quite left out . " " Sybil 's gone out to Greenwich for the night , " he explained . " She said to tell you how sorry she was . " " How sorry was that ? But never mind . I 'm glad she 's not here . I need a man to myself . Grab a drink and come talk to me . " Philip had always enjoyed himself with Julia , and he liked the feeling of not being watched by Sybil . After a couple of cocktails he was having a thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting alone with him in a corner . " I do n't know why I give these ghastly parties , " she said . " It 's like some ancient fertility rite that goes on and on , long after it 's lost its significance . Sybil 's so wise to stay away . But then Sybil is wise . " " Why is Sybil so wise ? " he asked . " My dear , she managed to steal you out from under my very eyes . And nobody even suspected her , either . Until she walked off with the season 's catch . Oh , she 's deep , that girl . No question . " Philip laughed . He was pleased . " Was I the season 's catch ? " " Well , you know , I think you were . " She looked at him critically for a moment . " Of course , you were thinner then . More hair , too . I was mad for you . " " And now I 've lost my charm ? " She laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How you eat it up ! But not from me , boy . You 've got your Sybil . Let her butter you up . She 's paid for it . "  |p150He  laughed again . " Why are n't you married , Julia ? " " Oh , go to hell . " They kept being interrupted by couples arriving or leaving , but he stayed by her side . The Julia of whom he had vaguely disapproved in his law-school days , a Julia who had seemed a small-scale replica of his mother and her friends , was now a person in keeping with his post-war point of view . Her air of jaded superiority intrigued him . She made him feel , but not unpleasantly , like a young boy whom , for the moment , she fancied . " How about dinner tonight ? " he suggested . She looked at him with more interest . " After the party ? " " No , now . Let 's get out of here . " Julia made a rapid calculation . Most of the people had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hangers-on . If she stayed , for manners ' sake , she would be left to sup coldly on the remainder of the hors d'oeuvres . It was the kind of decision that she made quickly , but one could see that she was making it . " All right , " she said . " Let 's blow . " In the taxi he suggested Truro 's , a particularly expensive restaurant , before she had to . Her only worry was whether she would have to pretend it was her birthday to make him order champagne . This turned out to be unnecessary . " Let 's pretend it 's somebody 's birthday , " he suggested when they were seated at their table . " And order a bottle of champagne . " Really , he was perfect . Julia quite cheered up . " How nice to get away from that stuffy party , " she said , settling back in her seat and lighting a cigarette , " and to be taken out by somebody else 's husband . What else could a girl want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dinner . Shep151did n't have to make any suggestions as he ordered all the most expensive things . " You know it 's fun to take someone out who really likes good food and champagne , " he began . " They must be so hard to find , too . " " Well Sybil always likes to dine at home , " he explained . " Not that that is n't fun , of course , " he added cautiously . " But a guy likes to go out every now and then . The Rodmans are great ones for reading aloud and things like that . Sybil and her mother , that is . And Teddy . " If Philip had something on his mind he came to it directly , regardless of what other topic might have been offered . He was anxious , in his way , to be loyal , but it was impossible for him to keep off his own affairs . " I know what you mean , " she said . " I used to play with Teddy as a child . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about being Elizabeth and Essex . Of a deadliness , my dear . You ca n't imagine . Or can you ? " He nodded . " Did Aunt Jo play too ? " " Did she ! " Julia raised her eyebrows . " I 'll say . She was Arty , the life of the party . She 'd even dress up . " She finishedher cocktail . " But leave us draw a decent curtain over that . They 're not bad old things , Mrs. Cummings and Mrs. Rodman . If you like the type . Which I do n't . " Philip had never heard Sybil 's family so freely discussed , even by his own mother . " If Sybil could hear you ! " he exclaimed . " It would n't surprise her in the least , " Julia said coolly , taking out her compact and going to work on her lips in the deliberate way that she had . " She 's always disapproved of rne . Because I was n't nice to Teddy . Or was it because I was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , she 's always been incestuous about Teddy . " She pursed her lips as she applied the lipstick . There was something infinitely ! U ,  |p152assured  and arrogant in the way she turned their table into a ladies ' room . " I wonder you 're not jealous . " But Philip had no desire to explore new and ill-considered theories about Sybil and Teddy . The most that he required of his friends was that they should confirm his own presuppositions . " Do you ever get the impression , Julia , " he asked more probingly , " that Sybil is just a bit . . . well , flattened ? " He swallowed . " As if she 'd been sat on when she was little ? " Julia gave a peal of laughter . " Sat on ! " she exclaimed . " You mean run over by a truck ! Of course ! By Mrs. Rodman . And just as she was dragging herself out of the road , poor creature , Aunt Jo came by and knocked her out for the count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her interest to the bottle that the waiter was now pouring . " She 's so tense , " Philip continued , preoccupied . " She wants everybody to have such feeling about things . " " Probably because she has n't any herself , " she said , taking a drink from her brimming glass . " That 's usually the way , is n't it ? " When she turned to look at him , she was struck by his seriousness , and it occurred to her for the first time that he might be something more than the bored husband to whom she had become so drearily accustomed . This was a possibility that shed a very different light on things . Julia was not a person to discard a solution to her problems , particularly when that solution was tossed in her lap . She had not made her remarks about the Rodmans from any ulterior motive ; it was simply her usual way of talking . Now , she decided , she would have to concentrate . " Phil , " she asked suddenly , " are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But not overly so . Philip was crude ; he was relieved by directness.  | " Gosh , no , " he protested . " What makes you say that ? " " The fact that you want to buy another woman champagne , " she said , shrugging her shoulders . " So you can complainto her about your wife . " " But you 're sympathetic , Julia , " he said , smiling . " You have no idea how sympathetic you are . " " For a bottle of champagne and a dinner at Truro 's ? " she retorted . " You 're darn right I 'm sympathetic ! " " And I thought it was all because I was such a handsome guy , " he said , pretending to look hurt . " Are you sure it 's only the champagne , Julia ? " Somewhat to her surprise , for it was early in the evening , she felt his arm stealing around her back . Decidedly , it was too soon . Firmly , decisively , but not humiliatingly , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Philip Hilliard , " she said coolly . " There are a lot of things I 'm interested in , and looks happen to be only one of them . " She smiled at him as the waiter fussed with their plates . " Even looks like yours , dear . " She had not been unfair . It was not her fault if her candor should have been , of all things , the most intriguing to him . She had never studied people , even young men , closely enough to determine their preferences . They had a long talk about the difficulties of mismated couples , and in the taxi going home she was able to make him keep his distance with little more than a gesture . Decidedly , she had not done badly . When she got out he begged her not to tell anyone what he had said about Sybil . This she passed off lightly . " I would n't dream of telling a soul , Phil , " she said with mock gravity . " Except your Aunt Jo . And Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell them everything . "  |p154SO  , . ANYWAY , it started . It would not be fair to say that Philip ) went home that night infatuated , but he had certainlydecided that he wanted to be , and by the following morning he had decided that he was . Julia had become overnight the main interest in his life . He began planning , in his orderly way , how best to go on seeing her . The traditionalway , always the way that would appeal to Philip , was to plead business as an excuse for staying out at night , so he devised a series of fictional real estate operationsto engage his spare time for at least a month . Sybil believed him implicitly , and his scheme derived a totally unexpected support from his father , who told her , for no reason at all , that Philip was working too hard . Mr. Hilliard had a way of picking up impressions without any basis of fact and of stating them so firmly that others were convinced of their accuracy . It was now late spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Aunt Jo 's in Easton Bay , where he could join her for weekends . Easton Bay was within commuting distance of the city , but he had always made it clear that he would not commute . Sybil was not enthusiastic ; for the first time her feelingswere really hurt.  | " I thought you did n't like Easton Bay , " she pointed out . " And , darling , I 'd be away from you all during the week . " " Oh , I like Easton Bay all right , " he said hastily . " That was just a pre-war prejudice . " There was a pause . " Darling , was I a pre-war prejudice ? " He kissed her , with sincerity , in anticipation of the success of his plan . " I want you to get Timmy out of the heat , " he explained . " If you want to be cool you 've got to move . It 's as simple as that . " " We could go to your mother 's in Glenville , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing his wife and mother to combine forces . Any such combination , under the circumstances , was sure to be against him . " It 's as hot there as in the city , " he said decisively . " Besides , I feel more independent at Aunt Jo 's . " Sybil , as usual , was obedient , and by the end of June he was spending every evening from Monday through Thursday in Julia 's company . This , however , was not altogether plain sailing . Julia had no qualms about breaking up a home ; she had every intention of becoming the second Mrs. Hilliard . To her the whole matter of marriage and divorce was so completely a game , in which no holds were barred , that she found it actually difficult to understand people who felt otherwise . But acquiring a married man was a harder businessthan acquiring a bachelor , and Julia was not endowed with the discipline needed to maintain a pose of being pleasant , even when everything that she most cared about depended on it . She disliked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of June . " It 's all very well for you , " she would tell Philip . " You have your job . But what am I expected to do all day ? " She disliked even more his reluctance to discuss the question of divorce . She had shown nop156squeamishness about becoming his mistress ; she had decided , and rightly , that he was not the kind of man whose interest would increase with frustration . She had joined with him , however , in taking every precaution to make their affair a discreet one . Sex to Julia was primarily a business matter in which one could never lose sight of the ultimate goal . " When are you going to tell Sybil ? " she asked him one night as they sat at the bar of Truro 's . It was one of what Philip called their " free " nights , when , because of their habitual caution , they thought they could afford to be seen dining together , as old friends , in a restaurant where they were apt to see people they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her ? " He looked uneasily away . " It 'll keep , " he said . " Wait till the fall . " " You might as well know now , Philip Hilliard , " she continued in a more irritable tone , " that I have no idea of going on with this Back Street life indefinitely . After all , I did n't go to Miss Heely 's school and bust my family coming out in order to end up as a kept woman . " " Now , Julia . " 7 " I know it 's going to hurt Sybil and all that , " she went on , " but , after all , it 's got to come sooner or later . You ca n't go on indefinitely being married to someone you do n't care , about . " " No , but you do n't understand , Julia . It 's so difficult to tell Sybil . She 's so . . . well , it sounds conceited to say so , but she 's so wound up in me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good settlement , " she said . " She 'll be all right . " Philip did not like this at all . He did not like to have Julia assume so easily that any woman whom he abandoned would ever again be " all right , " and , like a true Hilliard , hep157loathed the idea of having to make a settlement . " Sybil does n't care about those things . " " Well , she 'd better learn , " Julia said crossly . " These moony , impracticable girls make me tired . They make the rest of us seem so mercenary . But I notice that they always seem to get what they want in the end . After all , she landed you . This was what Julia could never forget . Sybil had not been Philip 's " type . " It had not been in Julia 's scheme of things that he should have liked her . Therefore , it was a perfectly proper thing to supplant her . " I know it 's hard on you , darling , " Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I shall know when to act . " He really meant this . Julia 's temper had not yet diminishedhis infatuation . In fact he found it rather a relief after the almost cringing quality of Sybil 's submission . Julia , like himself , was of the world . She understood him , and she did not mind his understanding her . He would rather have continued on the existing basis with her , but if this was not to be , he was willing to take the steps required . There would be consequences and more consequences , scenes and more scenes ; he would have to face his own family as well as Sybil 's , but in the end he would have corrected his early error and started life again with a wife of his adult choosing . He was almost thirty and knew his own mind . Divorce , after all , was not the worst thing in the world . his sister , Lila , was in Reno at this very time.  |p158AS  AUTUMN APPROACHED , Sybil at last began to feel uneasy . Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had taken no more than ten days ' vacation . She had heard twice from solicitous friends who had seen him with Julia Anderton . She had not mentioned this , but he had seen fit to explain to her that when he was lonely in town he sometimes took out an old girl friend and " gave her a whirl . " Her mother , who was also at Aunt Jo 's , took a poor view of his non-appearances , and questioned Sybil closely about the nature of his real estate work . " I thought all he had to do was collect rents , " she said . " Oh , it 's much more than that , " Sybil explained . " You have to buy strategically and get control of corners and that sort of thing . " " Do you do it on weekends , too ? " Esther asked bleakly . " I suppose you must . " One Saturday after lunch she was sitting on the terrace by the rhododendrons reading aloud a Burgess story to Timmy . Aunt Jo and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition of how best to spend an afternoon in the country . Philip had telephoned to say that he was coming down for the weekend , and she was waiting for thep159sound of his car on the drive , hoping to catch him alone for a few minutes before he went off to play golf at Glenville with Felicia 's husband . Timmy , however , did not allow her attention to wander ; he sat beside her on the canvas-coveredsofa , one hand on her knee , peering intently up into her face as she read . He had not turned into a Hilliard . At least not yet . He was four and a half now and very thin , with spindly arms and legs and wide , cheerful blue eyes . Sybil loved him in her own tense , concentrated way ; she worried about his being an only child and being too much with her and Ellen , but she had no definite idea what to do about it . He seemed , despite her worry , robust for a child so thin and unexpectedly outgiving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had said to Blacky the Crow , " she read aloud . " Yes , sir , Sammy Jay was very sorry indeed . In fact , he was the sorriest jay She heard the roar of wheels on the drive from the other side of the house , and stopped . " Do n't stop , Mummie . " She stared out over the lawn , ignoring him . Then she heard the screen door to the front hall slam . " Mummie , please go on . Please go on , Mummie ! " " Darling , I think I hear Daddy . " Philip came out on the terrace , the evening paper folded under his arm . He leaned down to kiss her and put his hand on the back of Timmy 's neck . " Darling , " she said . " It 's been a long week . " " Terrible . " He sat down on a chair opposite and reached over to pick up Timmy and put him on his lap . " How are you , old man ? Been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about Sammy Jay , " Timmy explained in his high voice . " Do we have to stop now ? " " Just for a bit , " Philip answered . " Then Daddy 's going off to play golf . "  | " Philip , " Sybil said timidly , " I know you ca n't tell ahead of time , but I was wondering if you had an idea . . . any idea ... how long this period of night work was going to last . " He put both arms around Timmy and looked down at the top of the boy 's head . " Hard to say . Why ? " " I thought I might move back to town . " He looked up at her . " And roast this kid in the city ? " he demanded . " I would n't hear of it . " " Oh , Timmy could stay here , " she pointed out quickly . " Heaven knows there are plenty of people to look after him . Mother and Ellen . To say nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you , " she continued , speaking to Timmy , " if Mummie left you here with Grandma and Ellen for a few days ? " Timmy was playing with Philip 's fountain pen which he had taken out of his pocket . " I would n't mind , " he said . Sybil looked down at her clasped hands . She was ashamed to be so hurt by a child . Was she going to be like her own mother ? She looked up and smiled . " You see , Philip , " she said , " what I mean to you all . " Philip gave the boy a little shake . " Do n't say that to Mummie , " he said . " Of course , you 'd mind if she went away ! No , Sib , " he continued to her , " it 's out of the question . It 's perfectly absurd for you to be running into town every time I 'm held over at the office . That 's kid stuff . I wo n't have it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town ? " " Sybil , for Pete 's sake , ca n't you drop it ? " he said irritably , getting up . " You make too much of things . Hi there , Aunt Jo ! " he said eagerly , as the latter appeared in the doorway . " How have you been ? It must be swell to be out here all week . It 's hotter than Hades in town ! "  |p161Sybil  resolved to go into it again with him later that afternoon , but she found him evasive and , when she finally cornered him , positively angry . This frightened her , and as she did not know what to do , she did nothing . She cultivated a desperate hope that if she ignored the whole problem , it might turn out not to exist . The end of August and Septemberpassed . It was her sister-in-law , Millie , who finally compelled her to face the facts , shortly after Sybil had moved back to town for the winter . She and Millie got on as well as could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself would have liked to develop the relationship . She would have enjoyed the role of older sister and the long , intimate chats in which her extra year of age and social experience might have given her a lead . But this was not to be expected with a sister-in-law who cared nothing for the little things that filled Millie 's life . " She does n't think the way other people think , " Millie used to protest to Teddy . " I always seem to be saying the wrong thing to her and putting my foot in it . " What provoked Sybil about Millie was the way that she exploited her own helplessness . Millie might always be invitingthe world to admire the excellence of her domestic arrangements , but these arrangements were rarely the accomplishmentof the gentle , poised creature who so proclaimedthem . Behind the pretty backdrop of Millie 's independencelabored the unseen stagehands who made it possible for the show to go on . There was primarily , of course , Teddy , infinitely patient and attentive ; then there was Esther who saw to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , who took the children when Millie was " tired , " and sent supplies and arranged for repairs ; there was Uncle Stafford who supplemented Teddy 's income and Aunt Jo who gave Millie parties and bought her novels and took her to the opera . And it was all done , too , with thep162sense that if it was n't done , Millie , at any moment , might simply collapse on her pretty pink-coverleted bed and never get up , for that was the way Millie would do it , if she ever did it . Without warning . Not that she had ever threatened this or anything like it . But one knew , if one was her husbandor aunt or mother-in-law , that Millie 's motor was a small , delicate , one-cylinder affair , like a machine in a child 's toy , not really designed to move its vehicle forward except , once in a while , over a smooth carpet , before admiring eyes . If Millie were to be kept moving , as life seemed so remorselesslyto require , through emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be by grace of the pushing and pullingthat had to be carried on , unseen of the audience , by wires leading to and from the wings . And it had worked , at least so far . Millie moved gracefully across the stage and seemed , indeed , to put her sister-in-law in the shadow . She was Jo 's and Esther 's masterpiece . Millie called Sybil on the telephone after the latter 's returnfrom Easton Bay and suggested that they go shopping . It was the kind of excursion that they usually made together once a month . When Sybil went to their club to meet her at the appointed hour , she found , as usual , that Millie was late . " Darling , " Millie said when she finally appeared at the door of the waiting room . " I 'm miserable to have kept you . But my cleaning woman 's had to stay with that son of hers who 's always getting sick . I had to call Mrs. Rodman to get me someone . " " Poor Mummie . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sybil put down her magazine , and they started forth . Before counters heaped with gloves Millie tried on pair after pair , holding her hand out in front of her and turning it this way and that ; in front of glass shelves bearing little bottles and enormous powder puffs she sniffed and madep163Faces . Sybil showed what interest she could , but Millie did not need advice . She only wanted to have her disinclinationsconfirmed . " But you have n't bought a thing for yourself , Sybil , " she protested during the absence of a salesman in search of a black silk slipper with a pinker bow . " And that 's what I really had in mind for this morning . " " Oh , I have plenty of things . " " Sybil , that is n't so . " Millie became very serious on the subject of clothes . It was the only field in which she could assert authority over her sister-in-law . " You 've got plenty of those plain suits that you always wear . They 're good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has it never occurred to you , my dear , that you 're getting just a wee bit old for that ? " Sybil laughed . " Maybe so , Millie . I was n't trying to be boyish . I just had n't thought about it . " " But should n't you think about it ? " Sybil looked at her more attentively . Millie never kept the conversation away from herself unless she had somethingsignificant to say . Something , anyway , that Millie regarded as significant . " Does my appearance embarrass you , Millie ? " she asked in a different tone . " Please tell me if it does . " Millie immediately became warm and confidential . She patted Sybil 's arm . " Of course , you do n't embarrass me , darling , " she said . " Do n't be so prickly . But people who are always reading books and thinking big thoughts sometimes forget the little things in life that help . There 's nothing wrong with your beingan intellectual , dear . I 'm all for it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? " " What shall I buy , Millie ? You be the judge . " " Something feminine , " Millie said promptly . " And win/ning . Something that 's helpless without being helpless . If you see what I mean . " " Winning ? " Sybil repeated . " Whom do you want me to win , Millie ? " In the pause that followed Sybil realized for the first time that Millie was embarrassed . " Maybe I should have said  --  win back , " she answered in a low voice , looking down at the floor affectedly . There was a long pause . When Sybil broke it , it was on a dry note . " I did n't know my troubles were so public , " she said . " Do you think , Millie , that Philip is a man to be won back with a hat ? If he 's lost , that is ? " " Certainly I do ! " she exclaimed , obviously relieved that she had not been the one to bring up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes him look at you differently . What does Julia have to offer him , I 'd like to know ? If you lose him to Julia , darling , it will be a case of default . Pure and simple . " The atmosphere in the long pink room of evening slippers and jeweled buckles , of round bottles of perfume in glass cases , of silk stockings draped over French dolls , the sense , in short , of an overwhelming femininity was suddenly stifling to Sybil , as if her nose had been buried in a huge powder puff . They mocked her , these things ; they seemed to say with a sneer : Do you think we do n't know men , Sybil ? After all the centuries ? And did you really think you could defyus ? " Oh , Millie , " she said miserably , " I 'm so ignorant about these things . Does he really like Julia ? I did n't know . Millie , " she continued , putting a hand on her arm , " what shall I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really see her all the time ? " Millie was overwhelmed by this sudden flood of appeal ; it was more than she had bargained for . Luckily , at just thisp165moment , the salesman returned with her slipper . Raising her finger to her lips and detaching her arm from Sybil 's grasp , she continued the conversation as though they were discussing a mutual friend . " But I thought you knew about her , my dear , " she said . " He 's been taking her out all summer . " Sybil 's head reeled . " I knew he saw her , " she murmured . " But not like that . I did n't really think it was that sort of thing . " " It 's always that sort of thing , " Millie said decisively . " Always . No , that 's still too big , " she continued to the salesman . " And too pink . Have you anything with a lavender bow ? " " I 'll see , ma'am . " " The thing to remember , darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down again , " is that it wo n't take much to beat her . I 'm not really worried about you , to tell the truth . But you 've got to brighten yourself up a bit . Julia 's too disagreeable to hold any man for long . She 's bound to hang herself , given enough rope . But if I were you , Sib , I would n't give her any rope at all . " " But do I want to fight for Philip ? " Sybil protested . " Has it come to that ? And if it has , should I ? " " Nonsense , nay dear , " her sister-in-law retorted . " Any woman must fight for her man . " Millie had become a characterin any , in every play . " You must n't be a doormat , " she continued . " Doormats are what men step on on their way to other people 's houses . " Sybil stood up . It was unendurable that Millie should know more about her life than she did . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said with as much dignity as she could muster . " But it may also be that some things are n't worth fighting for . " And turning , she went swiftly out of the hated shop.  |p166She  walked for three blocks without thinking of anything and turned into Central Park . Then she tried to think that she was stunned ; she was even conscious of her own disappointmentthat her mind should be functioning as clearly as it was . Could one be overwhelmed or even disappointed when one was alone ? Did human relations have only to do with humans in company ? And then it all came over her again , and she had to sit down on a bench . My God , she said to herself , ' I want to die . I really do . When she arrived at her mother-in-law 's table at the restaurant where Lucy always lunched , she found her with Viola Paton drinking vermouth cassis . Lucy took in her paleness and her stare and knew what was wrong . " Have a drink , child , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . " Sybil sat down between them . " Thank you , " she said . " Have you been shopping ? " Lucy continued . " Or have you just seen a ghost ? Viola , my dear , you 've scared the child . It 's that dreadful powder of yours . " But Viola raised her hand . " Lucy , I think she 's ill . " Sybil shook her head . " It 's only that I 'm not modern , " she said in a level voice . " I heard just now that my husband is in love with someone else . We 're brought up to take these things in our stride . I should be able to keep my chin up . But I ca n't . " Lucy and Viola exchanged a quick glance . " You 're not jumping to conclusions , I hope , " Lucy said sharply , " because he 's been seen out once or twice with Julia Anderton ? " " I know all about it , Mrs. Hilliard , " Sybil said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy shook her head abruptly . She wanted her to stand by for possible emergency duty .

" You know all about it , fiddlesticks , " she said in her rough , kindly tone . " You do n't know a thing about it , my dear . You probably think this Julia is the first . But if I know my Hilliard men , and I 'm afraid I do , she is n't . Oh , I know how you feel . Like lying down and giving up . And nobody could blame you for a minute .

" He moved quickly about , fussing , getting her an ash tray , cleaning off his desk . Then he left the room , closing the door softly behind him . Lucy checked her little red hand book and dialed Philip 's business number . " It 's Mrs. Hilliard . I want to speak to my son , " she told the girl who answered . " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Hilliard .

" There was a silence , heavy with his consternation . " What do you know about me and Julia ? " " Whatever there is to know , " she retorted . " You 're so damn naive , Philip . You 're like a smug little goldfish that does n't know we 're all watching you . Everyone 's known about you all summer except Sybil , poor creature . " There was another silence . " Why did n't you tell me ? " he demanded . " Because I thought you 'd be over it by now . " Her tone relented as she sensed his confusion . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you know it . But Sybil cares so terribly . Why do n't you come over now , dear , and reassure her . The poor child thinks her marriage is on the rocks . " She heard him take a deep breath . " But I ca n't reassure her , " he said . " I was going to tell her this week , anyway . I want a divorce , Ma . Julia and I are going to get married . " " Are you crazy ? " she almost shouted . " Do you want to make yourself a complete laughingstock ? " " You 're just going to say something you 'll regret , " he said , anger taking the place of his surprise . " You always do , you know . Remember how you were when Sybil and I were en-gaged ? " " That was then , " she snapped , " and this is now . That girl 's made you a perfect wife . Do you want to throw her over for some tart who 's after your money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry there was no stopping her . " Well , there wo n't be any money , my fine sir , " she continuedexplosively ; " that 's what you 'll find out .

" Philip would have hung up except that he wanted to give her a message for Sybil . Besides , he had had enough experience with his mother 's temper to know how quickly it could come and go . " This is not dignified , Mother , " he said . " Will you kindly allow me to handle my own life and be good enough to tell Sybil that I shall come to the apartment to see her as soon as she 's through with you ? " " I 'll bust that trust I set up for you , " Lucy continued wrathfully . " I 'll sue you and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lucy returned to her table , trembling with anger , but aware that she had allowed her temper to interfere with her strategy . She was almost shamefaced when she took her seat between Sybil and Viola . " There 's nothing to worry about , " she said ; " it 's going to lake a little time , that 's all . " Sybil had not said a word in her absence . She was still numb ; she had a curious , almost intriguing feeling of being isolated , without being able to communicate , behind the frozen wall of her own pain . But when she saw the discomfort in her mother-in-law 's eyes she roused herself . " You 've been talking to Philip ? " she asked . " Yes . But just for a minute . As you saw , my dear . " " He wants to marry her , does n't he ? " she continued . " Darling , he 's got some crazy Hilliard notion in his head , " I ucy admitted nervously . " But it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , really talked to him , and wait till his father has " But he does want to marry her ? " Sybil pursued . " Well , he thinks he does . Now . " " If he wants to , " Sybil said clearly , " he shall . " She listened impassively to Lucy 's and Viola 's protesta/tions . When Lucy finally told her that Philip was going back to their apartment to see her , she got up and left the restaurantto meet him . At home she sat in a chair in the middle of the living room to smoke a cigarette and wait . She realized , as her eyes roamed over the walls and furniture , that it was not a good room . Most of the things in it had been wedding presents or loans ; the Chippendale chairs had come from Lucy ; the eighteenth-century flower prints along the walls , slightly faded , belonged to Aunt Jo ; an Aubusson carpet , unhappy in its surroundings , had been the gift of the Hilliard aunts . Her own things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered about , but not in a way or of a nature to pull the room into any sort of coherence . She had not cared about coherence . Maybe Millie was right ; maybe such things mattered . It was Millie 's world and Philip 's world and even Julia 's ; there was no point resenting it . If they all wanted it their way , why should they not have it ? She heard the rumble of the elevator doors and then Philip 's key in the lock . " Sybil ? " he called from the hall . " In here . " She watched him as he came into the room . He looked self-conscious and embarrassed , but his eyes did not try to avoid hers . He sat down on the sofa and lit a cigarette . " I understand Ma 's spilled the beans , " he said . " Millie told me . " " How did Millie know ? " Sybil only shrugged her shoulders . " There 's no point in my saying I 've been a heel , Sib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There really is n't much point in my saying anything , I suppose . We were probably too young when we married . Now I want to marry Julia . That seems to be about it . " As she looked at him and heard him actually say it shep171felt the tears that she had determined to hold back , " Oh , Philip . " " " I 'm awfully sorry , Sib , " he said unhappily . She put her hand over her eyes . " You need n't be , " she said . " I always knew that I was n't the person for you . I wanted to be . God knows I wanted to be . " She paused for a few seconds to keep back a sob . " But I was n't . I knew you , and you did n't know me . So I was t lie guilty one . I 've had several happy years , and that 's all I have coming to me . If you want Julia now , you should ! lave her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop the flood of selfabasement . He put his arm around her shoulders , but she even kissed his hand . " Sib , " he protested . " For Christ 's sake ! " " I trapped you into it , anyway , " she continued wildly . " You can have your divorce ! Of course , you can have it ! " She had forgotten her lines ; she had collapsed entirely . She could only bury her face in her hands and sob without pretense of control . For she knew , even in the darkness that was engulfing her , that she had reached the nadir of her humiliation ; she knew that she had embarrassed and disgustedhim beyond hope of repair . But if it was too late , why should she care ? Was she not already beginning to feel , deep down , an odd , resentful satisfaction that she should be acting so exactly as he must have expected her to act ?  |p172PHILIP  MOVED OUT of the apartment that same day and took a room at his club . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feeling ran high and was largely antagonistic to Philip . Lucy Hilliard carried on her campaign against Julia by announcingas publicly as possible that all of her sympathies were with her daughter-in-law . Sybil 's refusal to fight disgusted her . " It seems rather hard that nobody should be lifting a finger to save your marriage except myself , " she told her crossly . " You 're very kind , Mrs. Hilliard , " Sybil said firmly . " And I ca n't tell you what it 's meant to me . But I have to do what I believe is right , do n't I ? What does anything else matter ? " Next to Lucy , Aunt Jo was the person most upset by the news . It filled her with disappointment and remorse that the handsome and eligible young man whom she had so recommendedto her sister should turn out as Esther had predicted . She was very snappish with the Misses Hilliard when they insinuated that their nephew might not be the only one at fault . This suspicion had its origin not so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ofp173his whole generation , a distrust which they cherished sufficiently to find the news about him and Sybil not totally distasteful . " The way children are brought up today , " Miss Emily said sadly , when she and her sister called on Aunt Jo , " one ca n't really expect anything else . They marry whenever they choose , whomever they choose , and at the first little snag  --  hoof !  --  they 're off to Reno . " " I might point out that Sybil was not brought up that way , Emily , " Aunt Jo answered in a voice that had a slight tremble . " Nor is the home atmosphere at my sister 's in the least comparable to the atmosphere at Lucy 's . Sybil , it seems to me , has been a good wife by the standards of any of us . " " Of course , Jo . " " Nobody was criticizing Sybil , you know . " All heads nodded , and the subject was changed . George Rodman did a great deal of blustering about his son-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Philip . Teddy seemed the least surprised of the family and said almost nothing , while Millie went about telling her friends how different things would have been if " poor Sybil " had only listened to her . Philip 's sisters were distressed , but they did not take divorce seriously . Arlina Hilliard , the youngest and Sybil 's particular champion , squeezed all the drama out of it of which she was capable . " My sister-in-law , " she would whisper to her friends darkly at debutante parties , " has had to put up with things that I could never have put up with . Never ! " Esther was the person who accepted the matter with the greatest resignation . Her concern had always been over future catastrophe ; she could show commendable calm when laced with the actual event . As long as she had made her sacrifices , as long as she had put in her quota of worry , did the ultimate decision really concern her ?  | " It may be difficult for you to see it now , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but this could be one cloud that really has a silver lining . I never thought you were made for that Hilliard life . I know it 's painful for you to admit that , but we might as well look at the bright side of things . If there is one . You are what you are . " " You mean I am what you 've made me , " Sybil said dryly . " Perhaps . " She had no patience with any of them . The mist of convention that covered the termination of her marriage seemed as thick and cloying as the mist that had covered its commencement . Philip had told her that she must have a lawyer and to everyone 's surprise she had turned , not to Teddy , but to Nicholas . His impersonality was a balm after so much family solicitation , and underneath it she felt an unexpressed sympathy which was the only kind that she wanted . When she went to consult him in his office downtown , he listened to her story , his large eyes fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had finished he twisted his big gold signet ring around a long finger . Then he moved an ivory paper cutter from one side of his desk to the other . " So you propose , " he said , " to go to Nevada and get a divorce there . You propose further to accept any settlement that the Hilliards may offer . And , finally , you propose to have a loose , informal arrangement about the custody of your child . I see . There 's only one thing that I do n't quite understand . " " And what is that ? " " What you need a lawyer for . " She looked at him blankly . " But are n't there papers and things to be drawn ? " " Not for unconditional surrender . Let the Hilliards draw them . " " Oh , I know it seems terrible to you , Nicholas , " she said , " but I ca n't be technical with Philip . I know it looks as ifp175lie 's behaved badly , but there 's more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's side , " he interrupted , in his clear , legal voice , " to justify your having to commit perjury in Reno for his sake ? " " Perjury ? " " Exactly that . " He looked at her gravely . " You will be obliged to state under oath that you intend to reside permanentlyin Nevada . I am assuming that this will not be your intention . What is that but perjury ? " It was never possible , in arguments with Nicholas , to know what moral significance he gave to facts . " Suppose I get the divorce in New York ? " she suggested . He nodded immediately . " Much better , " he said . " Then it will not only be honest but airtight . " He paused for a second to watch her . " Of course , we will have to prove that Philip has committed adultery . But from what you have told me , I do n't anticipatemuch difficulty with that . " Sybil flushed . " Oh , Nicholas ! " she exclaimed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He raised his eyebrows inquiringly . " I fail to see why , " he said coolly . " As a formula it fits the facts . Miss Anderton may not like it , but I ca n't imagine why we should consider her feelings . The divorce , when granted , would be valid beyond question , and , as I would handle it , instead of a Reno lawyer , it would cost you nothing . There might be a few disagreeable articles in the tabloids , but I ca n't see why we should care . Certainly the Hilliards can rise above a little publicity . " She shook her head . " I could n't do it , Nicholas , " she said . " You know I could n't . There must be some other state . " " You have this idea , Sybil , " he said severely , " that it'sp176right and proper for a wife to give her husband a divorce for the asking . Unfortunately , that is not the premise on which the laws of divorce are based . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , Nicholas ? " " I would suggest , to begin with , " he said , as they turned at last to the practical remedy , " that I draw up a separation agreement to be signed here . " He stared over her head at the gloomy print of Chief Justice Taney on the wall behind her . Nicholas had all the mannerisms of his profession , the steady stare , the occasional nod , the alternating slow-fast tempo of speech and the precise , almost defiant enunciation of legal terms . " This agreement would provide for a substantialproperty settlement , and it would give you absolutecustody of Timmy . Philip will sign it . He 's hardly in a position not to . This will not mean , of course , that he can never see the child , but it will place the matter in your dis-cretion . " Was it resentment , she asked herself . Was it that which made him so anxious to penalize Philip , to disgrace him ? She wondered if everyone , like herself , really envied the Philips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged , " he continued in the same metallic tone , " but not a minute sooner , we can entertainthe question of divorce . But I can see no reason why you should go to Reno . Let him go . He wants his freedom . Let him perjure himself . " There was a moment of silence . He had had his fun now ; he had finished . " I know you 're the best friend in the world , Nicholas , " she said , " and I know that you 've given me the best advice . I knew , of course , that you would . " She stood up . " But my hands wo n't be any cleaner for not going to Reno . It 's all part of the same thing . If I have to be a perjurer , I have to be a perjurer . I 've told Philip I 'll do what he wants . Andp177I 'm sure that you 'll help me no matter how much it goes against the grain . I 'll call you when his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After she had gone , he sat there alone , still looking at the picture of Chief Justice Taney . Of course , she was right . He would do as she asked . But he could not help wondering , as he shook his head , if he would ever learn to understand the different elements that went into the make-up of his stepmother 's niece , or what in the world she had ever seen in a man like Philip Hilliard . Towards the latter , whom he had always disliked , his bitterness was not allayed by Sybil 's generosity . He allowedPhilip and his lawyer to come to his office , at her request , and he listened to them with a formal politeness . He then , rather grimly , went to work on the necessary papers . But there were certain things that he would not even try to be polite about . He was walking through the bar of his club , on a night that happened to be ladies ' night , on his usual lonely course to the dining room , when his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple in a corner . He passed straight on without nodding , but as he was about to enter the dining room he heard a step behind him and felt a hand on his shoulder . " Nicholas , I 'd like you to meet a friend of mine , if you 've got a moment , " Philip said in his friendliest tone . " Come on back , can you ? " Nicholas looked at him coldly . " Who is your friend ? " Philip flushed for a second , but only for a second . " Julia Anderton . " " I have met Miss Anderton in the past , " Nicholas answered in clipped tones . " I see no necessity for our being introduced a second time . " Philip 's mouth fell open . Was it an era , after all , when anyone refused to meet anybody ?  | " Oh , Julia 's all right , " he said cheerfully , putting his hand again on Nicholas ' shoulder . " You 'll like her . Once you get to know her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why should I get to know her ? She 's your mistress . Not mine . " Philip took his hand off the other 's shoulder and turned very red . " You 'd better watch your step , Cummings , " he said ominously . " You 're talking about the young lady whom I intend to marry . " But Nicholas simply continued to fix him with his chilly stare . " It 's hard for people to know that , is n't it , " he inquired , " when you 're still married to my cousin ? " There was a weighty pause . " Well , anyway , " Philip said heavily , not knowing what honor might require in so awkward a situation , " you 'd better cut out those cracks about Julia . Unless you want your block knocked off . " Nicholas , however , was remorseless . " Do you regard the term mistress ' as a crack ' ? " he demanded . " I 'm sorry . I had thought it accurate . You 're not going to deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should tell you that as your wife 's lawyer , although in no way at her instigation , I have made it my business to find out exactly what your relationship with Miss Anderton is .

At any rate , I must insist on my right so to describe her whenever I have occasion to discuss your affairs with those who may be concerned . If you object , you are at liberty to seek redress , either legally in a slander suit or illegally , as you threaten , in an assault upon my person . " Philip 's breath was now coming in pants . There were no rules for handling a person who so boldly defied the most elementary precepts of good fellowship.  | " Would you like to step outside , " he demanded , " and settle this thing like a gentleman ? " " I most certainly would not , " Nicholas replied . " I have not come to my club to give you an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for a moment more , looking at him uncertainly . " Oh , go to hell , " he retorted . " God damn lawyers , " he sneered as he moved away . " Shysters . All of them . "  |p180NICHOLAS  MAY HAVE been committed to Sybil 's plan of action , but he certainly stalled for time . He took what Philip and Julia regarded as an eternity to prepare the detailsof the separation agreement , and he absolutely refused to be hurried . The delay , combined with his rudeness to Philip at the club , made Julia uneasy . She did not relish the idea of being advertised by Nicholas as Philip 's mistress , and she began to suspect a plot on the part of Sybil and the Rodmans to delay the divorce in the hope that Philip would tire of her . As she could not be sure that such tactics , if adopted , would not be successful , she decided , without consultingPhilip , to see his wife . " Sybil , could n't we get together and talk things over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the telephone . " It seems so artificial for us never to see each other . "  --  There was a pause of several moments . " You mean what they call a civilized talk ' ? " Sybil 's voice came back at her , cool and distant . " If you want to put it that way . Is there any reason why we should n't ? " Julia hesitated . " Except , of course , I know you 've always disliked me . " " That is correct . "  |p181Julia  had been brought up on the theory that no matter what she herself felt about the world , the world was bound to love her . Even under the present circumstances so marked an exception to the theory struck her unpleasantly . " Well can I come or ca n't I ? " she asked , rather crossly . " Come around now , Julia .

" Since her employment by Philip , Ellen had insisted on calling Sybil by her married name , but their relationship otherwise had retained its old informality . " That brazen hussy ! I remember when you were a child and she came over to play with Teddy how your Aunt Jo used to say : That 's a bold girl , Ellen . Keep your eye on her and do n't let her take any of the children 's things ! ' " " Thank you , Ellen , " Sybil said coldly , " but I think I can run my own life . " " You should have hung right up on her . That 's what you should have done ! " ' Why should Mummie have hung up on her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ellen , will you please take Timmy out now , " Sybil said sharply . The delay in the divorce proceedings , now of several weeks ' duration , had had its effect upon her also . It had not been , as Nicholas had hoped , to stiffen her into demanding better terms , but rather to make her reconsider , as Julia had feared , the very question of divorce itself . Deep down ,  |p182Sybil  had expected more recognition from Philip of the generosityof her surrender . She had allowed herself to picture a sublimation of their relationship into a selfless release on her part and a lasting gratitude , coupled with a faint , nostalgicregret , on his . However crushed , she could yet sustain her dignity by sensing the drama of her own annihilation . It was not that she required pity from Philip , or from Julia , for that would have been galling to her in the last degree , but she had expected that they would at least face the gravity of what they had done to her and contrast it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , had not even communicated with her since he had left , except for three telephone calls on purely legal details . When Julia , therefore , came into her living room that afternoon with an air of defiant , if elaborate , casualness , Sybil greeted her without rising , and only with a nod . " It may not be in the best taste for me to be here , " Julia began , sitting down , uninvited , on the sofa opposite Sybil 's chair . " And I know it 's a deplorable situation and all that , and I know you wo n't believe me when I say I 'm terribly sorry . " " I wo n't . " Julia swallowed . " However , as I see it , " she continued , " if we 've all got to bow to the inevitable , we 've got to bow . " " Apparently . " " I mean it 's to everyone 's best interests , " Julia pursued , " to get the darned thing worked out once and for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a solution that can satisfy everyone ? " There was a pause . " Certainly . A divorce . " Julia cleared her throat . " How else can anyone be satisfied ? " " Must they be ? " Julia began to be irritated . She wondered if her worstp183suspicions were not about to be confirmed . " What I 'm getting at , Sybil , " she continued , " is this . When are you planning to go to Reno ? I think I have the right to know that much . " What Sybil minded most , more even than Julia 's insolent practicality , was her attitude , so faintly concealed , that these things were routine and rather boring , that the least that could be expected of an unwanted wife was that she should remove her dreary self from the picture and let young love take its course . Sex , to Julia 's mind , apparently had its own duties and obligations ; the discarded should take their phlegmatic stand in line before the gas chambers without complaint . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tersely . Julia stared . " You mean you 're going to stay here ! " she exclaimed . She suddenly paled . " You do n't mean you 're going to divorce Philip in New York ! " Sybil shrugged her shoulders . " Why should I get a divorce at all ? " she asked . " After all , I 'm not the one who wants it . " Julia crossed her legs and settled back on the sofa with an air of relief . The brief vision of being named co-respondenthad not been pleasant . " I should n't think it would be much fun to be married to a man who wanted to marry someone else , " she said casually . " What sort of a home does it make for Timmy ? " The arrogance of this left Sybil speechless for a moment . " I 'll make my own decisions about my own child , thank you , Julia ! " she exclaimed finally , in a rush of anger . " At least I can make a better home for him than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused to light a cigarette . " Do n't get mad , Sybil , " she said calmly . " Nobody wants to take Timmy away from you . I simply thought that you and I could discuss the whole thing like two rational beings . " " Why should I be rational ? " Sybil demanded . " I don'tp184feel rational . I 've never felt rational about you . " Julia shook her head several times , wearily but patiently , as though she were arguing with an angry child . " You 're not making things any easier by acting this way , " she observed . " I know it 's hard , but you ought to be morerealistic . If you do n't get the divorce , Philip will . It 'll bebetter all around if " Let him ! " Sybil cried defiantly . " Why should I do everything ? Why should I humiliate myself by going to some shoddy divorce mill full of dressed-up cowboys ? Do you know what I think of practical people , Julia ? I loathe them ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , stay here then , " she said , " if you must . Philip can go . It seems rather hard that he should have to leave his job for that long a time . Particularly when you 're doing nothing . And as far as shoddiness is concerned , it 's six of one and half a dozen of the other . You 'll have to consent to the thing in any event . " " Why ? " " Because , my dear , " Julia said , almost condescendingly , " it wo n't be legal if you do n't . " " Who cares ? " Julia 's eyes widened . " You mean you 're going to refuse the divorce ? " Sybil hesitated . She had reached the point before she realized it . But in the sudden , startling void that surrounded her , she groped for this new direction . As she stared at Julia and the almost comic surprise on her features she felt her anger subside . " I 'm not going to refuse him anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to do anything in the least bit dishonorable . Not for your sake , Julia . " " But what 's dishonorable about consenting to a divorce ? "  | " I 'll tell you , " Sybil said , suddenly coherent . " Nicholas told me . Philip would have to perjure himself . He 'd have to swear that he meant to live in Reno . If I consented I 'd be joining in the lie . Compounding a crime , or whatever you call it . " Julia 's mouth had fallen open . Never in her long career of self-aggrandizement had she been blocked by a scruple so blatantly squeamish . " But , Sybil , everyone does that . They expect you to , in Nevada . It is n't what you think at all . " " He 'd have to swear , would n't he ? " Sybil persisted . Julia threw her arms in the air . " But it 's not a real oath . " " Then what is it ? " " Oh , my God , Sybil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be serious ! You 're doing this to spite me . How else could you and Philip get a divorce ? " " In New York . " " But you just promised you would n't ! " Sybil even managed a smile . She was not above feeling a certain pleasure at the sudden change in their positions . " I said I would n't do anything , " she said firmly . " And I meant it . I 'm not practical , Julia . I 'm not going to perjure myself for you . Or divorce Philip in New York . I 'm simply going on with my own life . With as much dignity as possible . If Philip wants a divorce , let him get it where we live . " " But you 'd have to commit adultery ! " Julia cried despairingly . Sybil actually laughed . " Now you 're really asking too much , Julia , " she said . " I do n't think I can arrange to commit adultery for you and Philip . No matter how happy it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want me to make myself a dishonest woman so Philip can make you an honest one . Ifp186you love him , live with him . Why must I consent ? Or give you my blessing ? " Julia had jumped up and was walking back and forth across the room . " Do n't be naive , Sybil , " she snapped . " Things have to be definite . One way or the other . I have to know where I stand . " " What do you want for your money ? " Sybil retorted . " And when have you spent more than a nickel on anything you 've wanted ? " Julia stopped and faced her . " I suppose this is one of your clever tricks , " she said . " You probably think you can get a better settlement out of Philip by making things tough . " r As Sybil stared back at her she felt whatever small satisfactionthere had been in defeating Julia ebb away . She felt degraded and tired . But she did not regret what she had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too passive . That she had lost Philip for good she would have to face . But that she would rescue him , however reluctant , from the fate of being married to Julia might still have its consolation . There was even a fierce , grim exaltation as the prospect of standing , an adamant rock of courage and resolution , in the center of the raging sea of their desired union . " Your own dirty thoughts are your own , Julia , " she said . They both realized at the same time that someone was watching them . Philip was standing in the doorway , looking in dismay from one to the other . He had called to pick up his squash racquet which he had left behind in the hall closet and had heard the angry voices in the living room . " Sybil ! " he exclaimed . She turned on him with a sudden fury that he had never seen in her before . " I do n't care what you say , Philip ! " she cried . " I know Ip187have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go your own pigheaded way , and nothing in God 's world will stop you ! But as for my helping to let this gold digger cut you in pieces , that 's out . I tell you it 's out ! " She was on her feet and standing in front of him , glaring up in his face . " If you can get a divorce , get it ! I may even give you cause . Good cause . But I wo n't do your dirty work , Philip Hilliard ! Not for one solitary moment more will I do it . God ! " She turned and gave Julia a look of withering contempt . " To think I could ever have thought of helping that slut to marry you ! I 'm no better than a pimp ! " Philip said nothing in answer to her onslaught . He stood dumbfounded , staring at her , and then suddenly put his hands on her shoulders , as if to hold her back . He could feel her trembling ; the intensity in her slim frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took them off her and turned to Julia . " Let 's go , " he said briefly . " Leave her be . " Outside the apartment house , as they walked down the street in search of a taxi , Julia found her tongue . " I tell you I think she 's nuts , " she said . " Seriously . They 're all queer , you know , that family . If you had n't come in when you did , she 'd have thrown something at me ! I hope she does n't have a gun . I tell you , Philip , I 'm actually scared of her . I mean it ! ' ' But Philip was not following her expostulations . The Sybil of whom he had had a new vision , quivering and taut and ready , like a black panther , to spring , was more the Sybil whom he remembered from their first meeting . He was already wondering if he really wanted to abandon so fiercely loyal a pet . When she was angry , he was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem petulant and coarse . " You should n't have gone there , " he said sharply . " I told you to leave all that to me. "  | " Oh , all right . " She shrugged her shoulders peevishly . " Except you were n't doing anything about it . You 'll admit that , I suppose ? " But he did n't answer her , and they walked on together in silence.  |p189SYBIL  CRIED most of that night , and by morning she was in a state of great emotional tension . She maintained her resolution , however , and went downtown to see Nicholas and tell him that under no circumstances would she consent to a divorce . When she had got this out she felt better . " I owe it to Philip , " she kept saying , " to save him from her . One day he 'll thank me . You 'll see . " " Are you sure , Sybil ? " " Well , if he does n't , he 's a fool ! " " All right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me now . I 'm on your side . " When Lucy Hilliard heard the news she clapped her hands . " She has some spunk , that girl , after all ! " she told her husband . " Now we can turn the heat on that philandering son of ours . " Which she proceeded immediately to do . Lucy was too pleased to allow herself to lose her temper at Philip again . She was casual , almost subtle with her favorite child , whom she had been seeing steadily in spite of their fight and in spite of her refusal to meet Julia . It was understood in thep190Hilliard family that violence was never resented for more than a day . " The hell of it is , " he told his mother a few days after the scene with Julia and Sybil , " that anything I do is going to be hard cheese on someone . " " Except on you , Philip , dear , " Lucy said with some asperity , as she gave the cocktail shaker an extra shake . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think in some ways it 's harder on me than anyone , " he said peevishly . For her answer she poured him a Martini . " The question before the house , " she said in a businessliketone , " is how we get rid of Julia . Is n't that it ? " " Now , Mal " " Look , Philip . " She settled back on the sofa , glass in hand . " Sybil bores you . Conceded . Julia is exciting . For the moment . Conceded . But what you do n't see is that any wife is going to be boring some of the time , particularly to a man like you . And getting rid of them is a dreadful chore . Now Sybil 's someone we all like . She 's a good mother to little Timmy , and she did n't make any fuss about this Julia business until you started talking divorce . For God 's sake hang on to her . It 's a million times easier to change girl friends than to change wives . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiringly . She was the arch-sophisticate , the original of the type that had always dazzled his less subtle mind . Now that his infatuation for Julia was dissolving into something more casual , he looked to Lucy to show him how to withdraw . " Julia wants me to get a divorce in Reno , " he pointed out . " Even if Sybil wo n't consent . She says that Sybil will never attack it in New York . " " Do n't be too sure . She might do anything in the mood she 's in now . Besides , how can you take the chance ? There'sp191the question of Timmy and alimony and who your heirs would be if you died . Julia knows that people in our position ca n't afford to take chances . She 's been around . " He nodded as he took this in . Then he turned to the next problem . " She says we might buy a ranch in Nevada and live there , " he said . " Then the divorce would be valid even without Sybil 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevada ? " " Not if I have to support Sybil here . Unless you help out . " Lucy simply laughed . " You know what you can tell Julia to that one , " she said . " Julia says she 's given up everything for me . " There was another pause . Then they both laughed . It was the hearty laughter of his surrender and her victory . " Darling , it 's all so simple , " she pointed out . " You tell her that your hands are tied . She took her chances at the start . She knew you were married and had obligations which you might not be able to get out of . Okay . So it has n't worked out . " She reached for the shaker . " It 's been what I believe they call an interlude . A beautiful interlude . " Philip applied this formula with exactness the very next day . He had never been one who could brook delay . Julia , he had to admit , took it all in better spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an egotist not to recognize when the game was up . " In another minute , " she said sarcastically , when he had finished his little speech , " you 'll be telling me that it 's been an interlude . " He said nothing . " One thing I 'll say for Sybil , " she continued . " It was n't she who put you up to this . It was that mean old mother of yours . " " I wish you would n't speak of my mother that way , Julia , ' he said with dignity.  |p192She  laughed derisively . " What an utter cad you are , Philip , " she said , almost admiringly . " You have a great big cake in front of you , intact . And crumbs all over your face from eating it . " " I do n't know what you expect of me , " he said . " Oh , I expect nothing , " she said with emphasis . " Nothing at all . Your women will always get you out of jams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God ! Run on home to your sniveling little Sybil and be faithful to her for a whole month ! " Philip left at once , very much relieved at having got off so cheaply . He could not even wait to get back to his club ; he telephoned Sybil from a booth . " Can I take you out for dinner tonight ? " he asked . " To any place you want ? " There was a startled pause . " What 's happened ? " she inquired . " Julia 's night off ? " " She 's at her family 's , " he explained . " Alone . " She still gave him no answer . " Well , what about it ? " he persisted . " Or maybe you have a date , " he added , politely and conscientiously . " No . " " Well ? " " Why not ? " But her voice was not enthusiastic . " What have we got to lose ? " He looked very handsome , and he ordered the dinner with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensible English . " I want everything to be just so tonight , " he explained to her . " You see , I have something particular to talk over with you . Something quite particular . " Her mind wandered vaguely over the different possibili/ties . He was capable of asking her opinion on the most unseemly topics . He was capable , indeed , of asking her what sort of apartment he and Julia should rent . " I suppose it 's something legal about the divorce , " she said . " But you know how I stand on that . If you want it , go and get it . I wo n't attack it . But leave me out of it . I 'm not interested . " He breathed a sigh of relief that she had not , in her recent scene with Julia , revealed even this degree of co-operation . " It 's not about the divorce , " he said . The cocktails arrived , and Sybil reached for hers , he thought , with an unbecoming eagerness . She drank it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , after quite a pause . " Really . " " We had a long , serious talk , " he continued . " I 've also had one with Mother . " " Well , marriage is a serious business , " she retorted . " Or at least it can be . " He ignored this . " I know you 've never liked Julia , " he said . " You 've always said she was discontented . Do you think she 'll always be discontented ? " Sybil finished her cocktail and caught the waiter 's eye . She raised her empty glass . " Julia eats people , " she said in a rather bored tone . " Everyone that she can . And she does n't even have table manners . She chews them with her mouth open and misses all the best parts . She never knows where her next meal is coming from , so she eats them even when she 's not hungry . But why should I care ? " She picked up the new Martini that the waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Darling , you 're bitter , " he said reproachfully . " You have n't been bitter before . Not this way . "  | " Have n't I ? " She shrugged her shoulders . " It 's not the easiest thing in the world to lose a husband . Even if it does happen every day . " " Sybil , do you still love me ? " She did n't even look at him . She sipped her cocktail and stared across the table at the little orchestra in red coats that was playing Victor Herbert . " You know I do . " Her voice was hard in sudden contempt for her own sentimentality . " Some people , I suppose , only love once . " " Let me tell you something about Julia , " he said immediately . " Something you may be glad to hear . " She looked at him inattentively . " Has she had a stroke ? " He laughed , rather too loudly . " No , " he said . " As a matter of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me . " " Oh ? " " It 's just that I agree with you . " " About love ? Of course , you do . You 've always been a determined romantic . " He shook his head . " No . About Julia . " She stared . " You mean you 're not going to marry her ? " It was his turn to signal the waiter . " I mean just that . " Sybil 's head swam for a moment . Then she found refuge in a laugh . " I hope you do n't want me to break the news to her , " she said . " No , I 've already done that , " he said in a pleased tone . " Can you imagine being nagged by Julia for the rest of one 's life ? "  | " But it would n't be for life , Philip , " she pointed out . " Not with Julia . " He put an arm suddenly around her shoulders and started talking in her ear . But the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing with an amazing circular speed and surging back and forth through her body . " I 've been crazy , Sib , " he was saying . " Out of my mind . Call it the war or the post-war or what you will . But it 's all right now , darling . It 's going to be all right , too . For keeps . If you can only bring yourself to forgive me . Can you , Sib ? Nobody could blame you if you could n't . But can you ? " When she opened her lips no words came out . Too much was happening in her mind for any thoughts to be formulated . She was conscious only of trying to drive something down , of sitting on it and desperately spreading things over it to keep it from sight , of pushing and jabbing at it and all the while knowing that it was rising around her , encircling , enveloping , overwhelming . She knew that she must not give in to it ; she knew dimly how much the love for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and caught Philip 's hand on her shoulder . " Oh , Philip , " she heard herself say in a strangled tone , " one does n't forgive Hilliards . One accepts them . That 's all . "  |p196AND  SO it all began again . When they got back to their apartment that night they went to separate rooms , but the next morning , without further discussion , it was recognized that the future , to some degree or other , was to be a joint undertaking . To Philip such decisions were simple ; he had made up his mind , and he saw no reason why she should have any difficulty in making up hers . Indeed , why ? Surely it was not he who had been moving like a wraith about the town , a dim , pale figure announcing to all and sundry , as clearly as though the words had been splashed in red on her wide brow , that she had been wronged ? He could not even understand it when at breakfast she told him that she wanted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own bedroom . " Well , sure . " He shrugged his shoulders . " Anything you say . Except I thought you wanted me back . Really back . " " I do , Philip , " she said unhappily . " It 's just that I need time . It 's all been so unexpected . One ca n't change one 's attitude so suddenly , " she said , looking up at him , " withoutsome loss of breath . " He picked up the newspaper . " You work it out your way , dear , " he said in the tone of even kindness that he adopted when his mind was made up . " I 've treated you like a heel , and I have no right to expect anything . "  |p197She  counted the minutes until he left for the office . Then she went into the living room and sat in a chair by the window looking disconsolately out at the East River . Later she took Timmy for a walk in Central Park , watching for friends and turning away when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not let herself think ; there were ideas , as she had felt at the restaurant , that had to be kept down . And what a thing it was , she reflected dismally , as she stared up at the statue of Fitz-Greene Halleck in the Mall and shuddered at the autumnal bite of the air , to feel a fool and to have no scapegoat but oneself . I am as these people , she reflected oddly , as she gazed about . I am not , after all , unique . When she came home there was a message on the hall table to call Teddy . He had already heard the news . Philip , of course , would have methodically notified the whole family . He would have called them , one by one , and used the identical statement to each , not so much because he had prepared it in advance as because his mind , set in a formula , could repeat itself without limit . " Sib , is n't it fine ? " Teddy exclaimed when she called him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end . " " You 're always right , Teddy , " she said a bit dryly . " I depend on you . " Her mother was less radiant than Teddy when Sybil went to see her that afternoon , but then Esther was not a radiant person . There was never enough breathing space between the end of one complication and the beginning of another ; satisfaction to her was a state of mind that only invited disaster . She had the intelligence , abetted by the superstition , to see danger in the fulfillment of any articulated wish . And Sybil had certainly wished for Philip 's return . She gazed at her daughter now over the tea tray with eyes that seemed to be searching for the problem that must be lurking under the square fabric of her son-in-law 's solution.  | " This must give you great satisfaction , my dear , " she said at last . " Particularly when you think what a good thing it is for Timmy . " Of course , Sybil reflected , Esther would think first of Timmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sense of achieved responsibility ? Joy ? What was joy to Esther ? " I do n't know how much it matters to Timmy , " she said gloomily . " There are so many divorced parents nowadays . It ca n't make as much difference as it used to . " Esther shrugged her shoulders expressively . " I know it is n't going to be easy , dear , " she said . " You ca n't mend a broken life in five minutes . Do n't be impatient if it 's not whole by tomorrow . " Esther 's consolation had in it the same note of worried superiority that Sybil had resented in the past ; she was still the Cassandra who smiled sadly at the collapse of ideals that she never sponsored . Yet to Sybil , who had felt , and for the first time , a rebuff in Teddy 's lack of comprehension , it was oddly welcome to feel that her mother shared her own sense of deflation . " Of course , I wo n't , Mummie , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would it ? And yet  --  when I think how happy I was and then how miserable I was , I do n't altogethersee  --  Well , there 's no reason why I should see . " Esther looked at her carefully . " I imagine that one would have to love Philip very much , " she said , " to be entirely happy with him . " Sybil looked up . " Why ? " she demanded . " Because he 's so awful ? " But Esther only shook her head . " No , dear , " she said gently . " I know it 's fun to misinterpret , but it 's hardly fair . What I mean is that Philip has mannerisms and ways of doing things , very ' particular ways , that are lovable  --  well , if they are lovable. "  | " Is n't that true of any man ? " Her mother smiled . " More so of Philip , " she said . Sybil had nothing to answer . She knew too well what her mother meant . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroic , through the sluggish , shallow waters of her mother 's fears to rescue her from the family sand bar ? Was he not to have been Esther 's final and complete re-buttal ? " What would you do about him , Mummie ? " she asked tensely . " Leave him ? As he left me ? Can I leave a man for being a fool ? " But at this Esther looked grave indeed . " My dear child , " she protested , " you ca n't expect me to make a decision like that for you ! " " You mean I 've made my bed , " Sybil said bitterly , " and now I can lie in it . " Esther , however , had no answer for this . She had turned her attention to pouring the tea  |p200PHILIP  WAS THE SOUL of consideration . At least outwardly . He seemed to find plenty to do at home without bothering her , and he never asked friends to the apartment without consulting her first . He suggested that she take a trip alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished , that they take one together . He was very polite to her family and agreed to dine at Aunt Jo 's whenever she asked him . As she still persisted in having their reunion a thing in name only , he sometimes did not come home until very late , and on such occasions no excuses were asked and none given . There was a tacit agreement between them to regard his schedule as dictated by extra work at the office . She knew that she had no valid basis for complaint , and she knew that he knew it . Yet it irked her that he should so take for granted that his physical needs had to be taken care of ; she would have preferred to have him dedicate to her a period of abstinence . Philip so obviously did not really think that he had wronged her , or at least that he had done anything for which his frank assumption of guilt and offer to return had not handsomely compensated . She had wanted him back , and he had come . Could a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she may have wanted was penitencep201and abjection , nor when she considered it , did she , in all honesty , feel that this was the case . Truly , she did not know what she wanted . She did n't want Philip to take her for granted and she did n't want him to pay her too much attention . She found that she was always observing him , about the apartment , with a sharply critical eye ; she was increasingly preoccupied with the elaborate methodicity of his habits . She followed his mental check-off list , when he selected ten records for the Victrola before settling down in his armchair with two small cushions at his back , a whiskey and soda in his hand and four cigarettes , his evening quota , laid out on the table beside him . His habits seemed to rejecther as complex and neurotic ; they seemed to say : Look at me , after all . I 'm fine . What 's all the fussing about ? What indeed ? She spent a good deal of time with Aunt Jo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetic . Aunt Jo seemed to take it for granted that Sybil should not be immediatelyreconciled to her husband 's return . She was a highly moral woman , and Philip 's misconduct had been a grave disappointment to her . As a realist she was ready to forgive iii the end , but she required a period of probation before t h e slate was wiped clean . " As long as he 's back to stay and sorry , " she told Sybil one morning , " we may as well see what we can do with him . " Sybil had never thought of herself , however , as being able to " do " anything with Philip . That had never been t heir relationship . All she had wanted from him was to be allowed to love him . For it was love that was to have rescued her from the meanness of her father 's world  --  and the cornpromiseof her mother 's . It was love that was tohave been her triumph and Teddy 's failure . It was love , her own love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could despise it . And it was all of this that she had tried to see in her feeling for Philip . She could even smile now , dryly , atp202the realization of this , for had she not always known , ironically enough , that his was not a pedestal to sustain her image of him ? Well , the foolish drama was over . She was not , as Prufrock said , Prince Hamlet . She had foundered in muddy waters , and the soft , thick sand that she could feel under her bow was part of the same parental shores from which she had resolutely turned her sails in the vivid past of an angry childhood . Very well . She would disembark . She would leave Philip and the cherished illusion that had never truly been an illusion . She would learn to live among the people whom she had despised , people who talked about love and what it meant to them , people who were always pretending that their love was deep and abiding even as they changed from one object to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was one of them . That night Aunt Jo gave a family dinner and took them , in her usual fashion , to the opera . It was a rather stiff occasion , being the first meeting between Philip and Nicholas since their unfortunate encounter at the club . Everybody , however , behaved well . When the curtain fell on the first act of Siegfried , Sybil clipped her arm under Nicholas ' and , took him for a stroll to the lobby . She brought her fur cape with her . " There 's been a war and millions of people killed , " she told him , " and I guess even the ladies of our family can walk between the acts now . " " It 's very commonly done , " he observed . " But does a thing 's being common make it right ? " She looked up at his fixed countenance . " If you only believed in something , Nicholas , " she said , " I would n't mind its being old-fashioned . But you do n't . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believe in , Sybil ? " " God knows . " They had reached the foyer and found a table . Sybilp203opened her purse-and took out a memorandum pad and a small stubby pencil . " I 'm going to write a note to Philip , " she said . " Which I want you to take back to him for me . Then I 'm going home . Alone . " She gazed at him for a moment , but he simply nodded . " It does n't surprise you ? " she asked . " Nothing that you do at the opera surprises me , Sybil . " She bent over the table to write her note . " Philip , dear , " she wrote , " I 've gone home . Please go back to your club or to your mother 's tonight . If you want to come to the apartment , of course , you can , but this is to let you know that I have made up my mind that the whole thing will never work . I ca n't go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even face the next two acts tonight . " She folded it and gave it to Nicholas . He nodded again . Then she put her wrap around her shoulders and hurried out of the foyer and down the stairs to the main door.  |p204WHEN  LUCY HILLIARD called the next morning at Sybil 's apartment she found her daughter-in-law sitting in the living room waiting for her . " What 's all this nonsense about , Sybil ? " she demanded . " Philip 's just been over to see me . He 's in a terrible state , poor boy . You ca n't be serious about this . " " Perfectly serious . " " What has he done now ? Is there another girl ? Already ? " Sybil shook her head . " No , Mrs. Hilliard . This time it 's me . " Lucy stared . " You mean you 've found someone ? " she asked , almost incredulously . " No . " Sybil smiled at her tone . " No , it 's simply that I 'm through with Philip . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **28;6094;TOOLONG . " Simply that you 're through with Philip ! " she exclaimed . " After he 's given up this Anderton girl and gone back to you ! After he 's turned over a new leaf ! " A note of injured maternal pride crept into her tone . " What do you want him to do ? Go down on his knees ? "  | " No . I do n't want him to do a thing . " " Did n't you want him to come back ? Is n't it what you and I have been waiting for ? " " I had thought so . But I was wrong . " There was a painful pause . " What is it that you want , Sybil ? " " I want a divorce . " " In a quick , involuntary movement Lucy raised her hands to her cheeks . " But my child , " she protested , " I thought you loved him . " Sybil shook her head . " I never really loved him , " she said . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " She looked at Lucy as the expression of hostility that she had been expecting filled her eyes . She had seen this hostilityon other occasions , with reference to other people . She knew that once aroused , it could not be put down . If Lucy was loyal in her friendships , she was not the less unforgivingin her enmities . A person had a trial before her bar of justice , but the verdict could not be appealed or the sentence mitigated . And Sybil was pleading guilty . " You do n't like Philip ? " she was saying in a harsh tone . " And may I ask why ? " But then she paused . " We should n't really be discussing this today , Sybil . You 're tired . One does n't get divorced because one 's husband goes to sleep at the opera . " It was a chance , a last chance for redemption . " Mrs. Hilliard , " Sybil said in a clear voice , " you do n't appreciatemy resolution . I ca n't blame you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can assure you that I will never go back to Philip . " Lucy frowned . " You might at least tell me what he 's done . " " He has done nothing , " Sybil answered . " Absolutely nothing . You see , Mrs. Hilliard , I want to be entirely honestp206with you . You have always been so with me . " Lucy made no acknowledgement of the compliment . " I have always seen Philip through rose-colored glasses , " she went on . " The other day I took them off . That 's all . Philip to me is now a man with whom I have nothing in common . I could n't possiblylive with him again . " She folded her hands in her lap decisively . " I 'm not going to tell you that I 'm thinking of anyone but myself , because I 'm not . I 'm not going to say that I want a divorce for Timmy 's sake , because I do n't . I 'm leaving Philip because I lack the will power to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it , a relief to feel the door so firmly closed to redemption . She had always been afraid that her mother-in-law , who had been in recent years so extraordinarily kind to her , would have been less kind had she known more about her . Lucy 's character , like Philip 's , was lacking in subtlety , and Sybil could n't but feel that if she had been accepted at all , it was because she had concealeda large part of her true nature . Now there was no further need to fear . To Lucy she must have seemed indeed contemptible , nor would this contempt be mitigated by her frankness . Frankness of her sort , in fact , would strike Lucy as unfamiliar and " queer . " " I could n't be more surprised , Sybil , " her mother-in-law said in a hard voice . " I always thought that you had a great deal of will power . It seems to me that you do n't choose to employ it . " Sybil said nothing . " You have n't mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , of course , that it is not fashionable among the young . But I had thought it might mean something to you . " Sybil felt a flash of resentment . It was hard that a woman like Lucy should talk to her about duty . " I thought it would be simpler if I told you what I wasp207going to do , Mrs. Hilliard , " she said . " I see no need to go into the list of duties violated . " This terminated the period of their negotiations . Lucy nodded , rather grimly , and changed her tack . " I wonder if you 've really thought this out , " she said . " You 've lost your grounds for divorcing Philip , you know . There 's a defense in the law which I believe they call condonement . Sybil felt a little shudder through her shoulders and her spine . " Would Philip refuse me a divorce ? " she asked . " You refused him one . " She nodded slowly . Lucy 's remark , which so brutally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prelude of further and less familiar conflicts , in courts and before lawyers , publicized , unbearable . She closed her eyes for a moment . " Of course , I sha n't want any money , " she said . " I could n't take a penny of Philip 's money . " " What will you live on ? " " I can go home . Or to Aunt Jo 's . " Lucy snorted . " She 'll like that , " she said . " And what about Timmy ? " Sybil looked at her in sudden fear . " But Philip always said I could have him ! " " That was when Philip wanted the divorce . " " I see , " Sybil said in a low voice . " But I 'm sure we can work something out , ca n't we ? Of course , I would n't want Timmy not to see his father . Or you . That 's the way it should be . " Lucy was almost touched , though weakness rarely moved her . " Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a final appeal . " You were n't made for this sort of row . You see what it 's done to us already . And it 'll go on this way . You 'll suffer for it ,  |p208Sybil  . Little by little you 'll turn into a smaller person . Becauseyou were never meant to be a divorced woman . Never . With some women it does n't matter . But not with you , dear.Believe me . " There was so much in Lucy 's appeal that Sybil could not answer her . There was even a hidden note of apprehension that Philip himself was the person who would really have the most to lose in a divorce and an appeal to Sybil to return , if only to save him from something worse , an appeal which contained , in a curious way , a tacit recognition of how little Philip had given her and an odd little bribe that if she would only return , Lucy would somehow find happiness for Philip and for her . For just a moment she felt on equal terms with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitied her . They were closer than ever before on the very brink of their separation . For Lucy seemed to be saying : " You 're a funny , intense , not unlikeable creature , and Philip has n't the sense to appreciate you , but if you 'll only stay , I 'll make it all right . And when I make a promise I keep it . If I die in the effort . " Sybil 's eyes filled with tears as she looked at her mother-in-law and slowly shook her head.  |p211IT  WAS ARRANGED between Sybil and Philip that Timmy should go to the Hilliards ' during the summer months after the first winter of their separation . Philip and his sisters always used the family place in Glenville as a base of operationsfrom June to September . One grandchild more or less was hardly noticed , and Lucy Hilliard , knowing that Philip wanted the sense of being a dutiful father with the least possible restriction on his activities , saw to it that Timmy was comfortably merged with her other grandchildren under the supervision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after leaving the boy there . It had not made it easier that Timmy so clearly regarded a visit to his paternal grandmotherin the light of a vivid and desirable change . As she drove away she wondered if he would not turn out , for all his sensitivity , to be a true Hilliard . Without Timmy she was more than ever at loose ends . Philip , coached by his mother , had stipulated a year 's separationbefore the divorce should again be discussed , and she was finding the interim a painful period . Aunt Jo had asked her to spend the summer with her , and she had accepted . Easton Bay had the advantage of being a half-hour 's drive from Glenville ; she could go over to see Timmy wheneverp212Lucy allowed it . Her parents usually stayed with Aunt Jo for their vacation , but this summer they had gone to a hotel in Quebec . The reason for this unprecedented step had been communicated to no one , but Sybil had guessed it . Her father , uncomfortable at best with the Cummingses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George and his daughter had grown further apart since her marriage , and his increasing tendency , as he aged , to contrast , loudly and dogmatically , his own rough and ready Americanism with the " pallid " intellectualism of his wife and daughter , had done little to bridge the widening gap . George knew that Sybil , silent as she was , observed him with a merciless clarity ; he knew that she was noting the increase in his drinking , in his loudness , in the scatological content of his anecdotes . At the golf club in Easton Bay , on spring and fall weekends , she would glance in his direction as she passed the bar and take in , acidly , the small group of younger men bored by him , held there by the tyrannical spell of his dirty jokes , a spell that owed its power to the belief of men like her father that a failure to respond in guffaws was a failure in virility . Oh , yes , she saw it and saw it with the completeness of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her earliest days , nor was she for a minute unwilling to speculate on the failure of virility in himself that made him so shrilly assert his masculinity in the consolingcompany of his own sex , at bars , with tales of the unachieved . His conversation with Sybil when she left Philip , for all practical purposes , finished things between them . " You must n't be too hard on Phil because he 's got a wanderingeye , " he told her , hoping that on this point at least he could speak with authority . " It 's the way most young fellows are . As a matter of fact , the wanderers often make the best husbands . You only have to look around . " He winked at her . " A girl who wants a faithful husband canp213always marry a man like Nicholas . " He gave a loud laugh . " And what girl in her senses would want that ? " Sybil , however , only stared back at him . " I think I might want that , Daddy , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal to be said for faithful husbands . Like Nicholas . And like you . " It was not surprising , after this , that George should have persuaded his wife to try a summer in Canada , leaving Sybil , for the first time in years , the only representative of the Rodman family at Aunt Jo 's . She loved the place ; it was more home to her than anywhere else . The house itself was not remarkable ; it was like any other big Long Island house of its era . It was large and square and of dark , dead brick ; it had too many small windows , a long blue gravel driveway and a series of decaying outbuildings in the surrounding woods and fields . There was a barn with two ancient horse carriages , a playhouse built for Teddy and Sybil as children , and a garage , also of brick to match the big house and marred by a clock tower with a clock that did not tell the time . But the woods were green and full in summer and austere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fields in the daytime and spend her evenings alone with her books . Aunt Jo , as always , was sympathetic . She rarely made any reference to Sybil 's domestic problems , yet she seemed to concede by her very silence that things were basically wrong . She even managed to imply , with a consoling gleam in her eye , that if things got too bad , she would bestir herself and find the remedy . Sybil was willing to sit by for the moment and allow herself to be sucked gently into the hum of activity that surrounded her aunt . It was as if her mind and body had taken on some of the paralysis of her heart , and she looked about the Easton Bay scene without distinguishing or caring to distinguish between the different individuals and events . She had lost her faith , her faith in whateverp214had kept her going as long as she had been going , her faith , presumably , in herself . It was only to be expected that , sensing the void that was opening beneath her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , to the brightly polished railings that surrounded the orderly park of Aunt Jo 's existence . Not , indeed , that she had any faith in the pattern of life that Aunt Jo and her friends exemplified , but at least it was a pattern . It held things together , and without it what would happen to them all ? What , without even their pattern , would happen to her ? She went out driving in the afternoon with Aunt Jo , and each drive always ended in a call . Then there were lunch parties and card parties and even , from time to time , cocktailparties . Sybil did not play bridge , but she could sit quietly by the card table , doing her needle point , and listen to the busy chatter of Aunt Jo 's friends . On and on it went ; she marveled at its inexhaustible flow and at their faith in the particular , the concrete , their distrust of the universal . Sometimes it amused her to think of Aunt Jo , with her incessantcigarettes and her card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eighteenth-century character , a marquise from a Thackeray novel , with red heels and a powdered wig , taking snuff at the whist table , but the picturewould soon blur with her memory of how Aunt Jo 's features would stiffen at the mention of certain topics , or of how she drew herself up before entering a drawing room , or of how she reveled in inferior , moralistic fiction , all true indicia of the intervening century which , with its pharisaism and its fatuity , had also its imprint upon her . Aunt Jo was never consistent with any picture that one might draw of her , but then Aunt Jo was far too sensible to care about consistency . The Misses Hilliard had always been among Aunt Jo 's close friends , and the opportunity of keeping an eye on their erring niece-in-law was not a thing to diminish the frequency of their visits to a house where the best company was keptp215and the best bridge played . Aunt Jo knew all about their peculiarities and the oddness of their point of view , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she never forgot that they qualified as " personages , " the highest category in her varied classifications . Sybil 's attitude towards them , however , like her attitude towards so many of the people in Philip 's world , had changed from passivity to bitterness . It was as if something within her were seething and boiling , trying to escape . When she meant to be simply critical this something would unaccountablyburst forth , and she would find that she had been rude . At a lunch party given by Aunt Jo for Philip 's aunts , she had an attack of nerves that she was unable to conceal . The ladies were discussing her old friend , Howard Plimpton , who had recently left his Mabel , whom he had married during the war , thrown up his job and was now living and painting over a garage in Easton Bay . Sybil had hardly seen him since her marriage , and she listened with interest to what they had to say . " Well , I suppose if you 're successful you can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Take Gauguin . But the thing about this Plimpton boy is that they say he ca n't even paint . " " You do n't mean , Jo , do you , " Miss Harriet put in , " that if he could paint , it would be all right ? " Aunt Jo smiled . " No , Harriet , " she said . " But it would certainly help . " " It all goes to show that you never can tell , " Miss Emily observed . " I understand that he was considered a very nice young man . Polite and considerate . And now suddenly  --  boom ! " She raised her hands to indicate the completeness of Howard 's disintegration . " I do n't know what else we should expect . The young have no discipline today . When they 're bored with a responsibility they drop it . Why not ? " It was evident from the tremor in Miss Emily 's voice and the aversion of her eyes , in whose direction her speech hadp216been aimed . The atmosphere around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it out of his system this way , " one lady , old and white and very soft , suggested placatingly . " And then they 'll patch it up . She has n't gone to Reno , has she ? " " Reno ? " Miss Emily repeated meaningfully . " Mabel Plimpton does n't have to go to Reno for her divorce . Not from what I hear . " Sybil 's mind was suddenly filled with the image of Howard as he had been before the war , at their dinners together , when he had talked so angrily and yet so passionatelyabout Mabel . " Maybe he could n't live with his wife , Aunt Emily , " she heard herself say sharply . " Maybe she was hateful to him . " Miss Emily did not turn to her , but continued to look across the table at her sister . She and Miss Harriet always did this when in conflict with others . They appeared to be carrying on a debate between themselves , and only the light in their eyes and the tense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were intended for a third person . " Some of us believe he might have thought of that before he married her , " she said . " What 's more , I hear that he does n't even support her . He wo n't send her a nickel . " " But he 's always been poor , " Sybil retorted , watching Miss Emily 's profile . " And Mabel has her own money . " " Would any self-respecting man allow his wife to support herself and their children ? " Miss Harriet demanded , apparentlyof her sister . " Why not ? " Sybil swallowed hard . Her heart was poundingviolently . " What possible right do rich , spoiled women have to be supported ? " The conversation , as though at a given signal , broke intoseveral smaller conversations . Sybil found herself deserted . " My dear child , " Aunt Jo said to her afterwards , in a gravep217voice , " it 's a great mistake for you to talk like that . " " Why ? What did I say ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was your tone . " " But I ca n't bear them , Aunt Jo ! " she burst out resentfully . " They 're so mean ! They goad me into being that way . You know they do ! " Aunt Jo shook her head . " You know that I love you and Teddy , " she said sadly . " You 're like my own children . And you know how I care about seeing that you 're provided for . I thought my worries were over when Philip came into the family . But now , my child , be practical . Your mother and father have almost nothing to leave you , and your uncle 's whole property is in trust for Nicholas . I 've saved what I can out of income , but it 's very little . You see , dear , you ca n't afford to be rude to the Hilliards . It 's as simple as that . " Her aunt 's big eyes , full of sympathy and kindness , were fastened on her own half-averted face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the note of appeal in Aunt Jo 's voice , by the sense of love and devotion behind all her worldliness . Yet , at the same time , she could be almost irritated at the lateness , the very irrelevance , of the appeal . " Girls do n't need money the way they used to when you were young , Aunt Jo , " she said sullenly . " I 'll be all right . " " But there is n't any point deliberately alienating people , " Aunt Jo reminded her . " Particularly people like Emily and Harriet . " And even though she knew that it was not an argument that would appeal to Sybil , she could n't , with herown overwhelming sense of its importance , quite avoid it . " Remember , dear , that Timmy is the only male Hilliard in his generation . And each of the aunts alone is as rich as Philip 's father ! " But Sybil could only cover her face with her hands . " Oh , Aunt Jo , " she protested . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect , at least , of turning Sybil 's attention to her own generation , and she began to go to the beach club in the mornings . This club , like everything else in Easton Bay , was a very special club . The beach was small and made up of more gravel than sand ; from time to time it was unusable because of the smell of dead fish . The clubhouse was a ramshackle , shingle affair with two wings of bathhouses that had canvas tops and a bar that served soft drinks and beer except on Saturdaynights when there was whiskey . The bay lay before it , small but pretty , filled with sailboats and surrounded . by green hills with the roofs of the oversized summer cottages looming over the tops of the trees . Unlike most clubs on the island the beach club cost very little to run ; it could afford to select its members , as carefully and as slowly as it wished , from its long and patient list of applicants . Sybil used to go there in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The weather was hot and damp , and she had no desire to do more than sit on the sand , alone , in the shade of an umbrella and gaze out over the bay . There were other people on the beach , her contemporaries , with their children , people whom she had known as personalitiesp219rather than friends in the distant grey summers of her unsocialyouth when she had been sent over to their houses , reluctant and shy , by an aunt whose faith in the healing powers of group activity had been infinite . She knew them ; she still spoke to them , but their presence brought back some of the old fear and the old hostility , and she was not in a mood to go on with it . Most of them had grown up in the tradition of Easton Bay ; they were nice , plain , rather dominatingwomen who had married young lawyers and lived in made-over garages or superintendents ' cottages on their families ' old places . They seemed harassed by the problem of raising their many children ; Sybil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach club in their battered station wagons filled with offspring , with favorite pails and shovels , with dogs and balloons and unrelinquishable dolls , of things beingbarely under control . Yet they were all engaged , as she would remind herself , in the serious business of living . If they were sure of their husbands and the direction in which they were going , if they were able to proclaim in their very messiness , however aggressively , the satisfaction of their own adjustments , was she in a position to cast stones ? The only person in Easton Bay whom she wanted to see was Howard Plimpton . She had thought of him frequently since the day of the lunch party when she had defended him against Philip 's aunts . Surely , whatever had happened , he and she would still have something to say to each other . If their earlier conversations had been about how to acquire Mabel , they might now discuss how best to get rid of her . She had seen him in the village twice since that day ; each time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on whose place he was staying , waiting for the latter to finish her morning call at the grocer 's . He never , apparently , went to the beach club . He looked exactly as he had always looked , surly and removed ; his hair was just as thick and just as short , and he had the same scowl on his square , rather rigidp220face and the same large , clear , blue eyes . Yet he had stared right through her as she passed the open car where he was sitting , in shirt sleeves and navy khaki trousers , stared , not insolently , but as if he had not seen her . When she had turned , uncertainly , to speak to him , he had . looked away . She had not been offended , simply disappointed . It was evident that he identified her with Aunt Jo 's world , that he assumed that she would be on the side of a society whose basic principles he had violated . It was not , of course , as she well realized , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituted this violation . Divorce had become , indeed it had been for twenty-five years , an accepted , a respectable thing . Howard 's offense , in the eyes of Easton Bay , lay in his apparent indifference even to the necessity or fact of divorce , in his refusal , by leaving his wife and business , to bother himself with the neat tying up and crating of discarded things that constituted , to one degree or another , some recognition of their value . Howard had simply walked out . One could do anything in the world but that . Easton Bay , without really acknowledging him , spent much of its time discussing him . He was proof that one scandal , unlike a swallow , could make a summer . " Whatever code you live by , " Aunt Jo told Sybil one day in an argument about Howard , " there are responsibilities . That you can never get away from . " " But , Aunt Jo , " she protested . " You beg the very question that he 's putting ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I mean he does n't believe in anything . " If she was to see Howard , anyway , it was evident that her only approach would be through Edith Kellogg . Edith was Howard 's cousin , and it was over her garage that he lived and did his painting . She was five years older than Sybil and had been one of the people in Easton Bay who had most terrified her when she was little , but she wondered now ifp221they could not be friends . For the Edith whose sophisticationand blatant knowledge of things that no one else knew had made the other children of Easton Bay feel so inadequate , this Edith whose speedy ruin had been confidently predicted by the irate nurses of little boys and girls whom she led into bad habits , had become , in her early thirties , after an unhappy marriage to a South American dancer , a warm and sympathetic woman , of whom some people in Easton Bay might disapprove , but whom no one could really dislike . She had resumed her maiden name and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , ugly shingle house of her now deceased parents , and to make it a social center for the small artist colony at Mog Beach , so near and yet so infinitely far from Aunt Jo 's world , and for those of her old friends , of whom there were several , who , because of business failure or marital discord , found her milieu a welcome change from what they were used to . Edith 's world was a casual , formless world of small and endless cocktail parties dominated by the tall , bony , trousered figure of the hostess , constantly smoking , stalking about the old-fashioned living room that had now been inadequately modernized with a handful of Eames chairs , the contrast of which with the false , very dark Jacobean paneling was so bad that she claimed it was intentional . She went occasionally to the beach club , and one morning she sauntered up to Sybil 's umbrella . " I hope you do n't mind my butting in , " she said , looking down at her and inhaling the smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up together , did n't we ? We share the same neuroses . And I 've had to shed a husband myself . It 's no picnic . Come around this afternoon for a drink , why do n't you ? " Sybil went and had several drinks and enjoyed herself . She liked the casual friendliness with which she was received by Edith 's group . Those who had known her before lookedp222at her with a new interest . She was the little girl who had so unexpectedly caught and so unexpectedly abandoned a Hilliard . Gone was the hostile shyness that had once repelledthem ; they viewed with approval her better clothes and better style . They were curious , but not articulately so , to find out what had happened to her marriage . Howard was there , in a white shirt , open at the neck , and khaki pants , and she had the courage , after two cocktails , to go over and talk to him . He stood apart from the others , near the piano where the drinks were , helping Edith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other day , " she reproached him . " You looked right through me , " " You did n't speak to me , " he said briefly . He was looking away from her , across the room . " Did you think I would n't ? " He shrugged his shoulders . " That was your affair , Sybil . " " Did you think that I would turn my nose up at you ? " she persisted . " Did you think I would say , There 's that terrible Howard Plimpton ? " He turned and gave her a level stare . It was curious , his stare , full of intended defiance , as if he were trying to prove to himself that , however he might dislike it , he could outfaceanybody whom he wanted to outface . " I did n't really care , " he said roughly . Then he shook his head , with a quick , nervous movement , as if , almost impatiently , to check his own rudeness . " I do n't mean that I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I mean I would n't care if you thought that . " " But you used to dance with me when nobody else did , " she continued . " How could I ever think badly of you after that ? " " Certainly I used to dance with you , " he agreed . " As I remember , you were a nice little girl . " " You mean I was sympathetic , " she corrected him . " I listened to people when they told me their troubles . "  | " Oh , yes . " He nodded . " You could do that . " " Thank you . " She made him a little bow . " I see you 're still a gentleman . " " Are you still a nice little girl ? " " I can still be sympathetic , " she said . But something in her tone made him stiffen . " I do n't know why you should think I need sympathy , " he said abruptly . " Unless you have more than you need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's true what they say , then , " she said dryly . " You 've lost your manners . " " Well , it 's my loss . " " You probably do n't believe you ever had them , " she continued . " Or that they mattered . But you did . And they did matter . They happen to have been one of the nicest things about you . " Saying which , she left him , with the feeling that her departurewas without effect . He made it so unnecessarily obvious that he had no need of her , that nobody , in fact , had any proper need of anyone else . She went over to Edith to say good-bye . " You see we 're not poison , Sybil , " the latter told her . " Why avoid us ? Join the gang . " " I 'm not sure that Howard wants me . " " Howard ? " she asked . " Has he been cranky ? But , never mind , dear , he 's cranky to us all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Particularly when he 's toting that log on his shoulder . " " Why does he come to parties , then ? " " As a matter of fact he hardly ever does , " Edith replied . " But even a lone wolf gets lonely , I guess . Sitting over there on top of the garage . " Sybil , encouraged by Edith , started to drop in at her house in the late afternoons . There were always people for cocktails , and occasionally she would stay on for a late coldp224supper . Aunt Jo 's disapproval was obvious but inarticulate . She did not like to lay down rules as to where her family could go and not go , but she felt that it was a singular perversitythat made Sybil choose for steady companionship the only questionable group in all of Easton Bay . " I suppose your aunt thinks you come here for orgies , " Edith remarked to her . " She 's right , too , " Sybil replied . " I 'm only disappointed that you have n't provided them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still young . " Edith had been right when she said that Howard rarely went to parties . At least , he rarely went to hers . The men at Edith 's were inclined to be more talkative than Howard and shrill . There was Frank Bayswater , for example , one of the perennial Easton Bay community , a long , thin , blond bachelor who , as Aunt Jo 's friends put it , had never " found himself . " Frank had a little money and no job ; he tried to make an existence , if not a life , out of a diminishing supply of the quality that he insisted upon regarding as his charm . He believed , extravagantly , in his prowess with women and bored the younger men at Edith 's with unsolicited tips in the art of making love . He was very stupid , but Edith liked him , and her group , highly tolerant , accepted him . They were amused when he singled out Sybil for his particular attention . He assumed , so obviously and so ludicrously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with him . One Saturday night , at the beach-club dance , Frank and Sybil were sitting alone on the terrace drinking whiskey and watching the ripple of moonlight on the surface of the bay . " Do I presume too much in wondering if it has struck even you , Sybil , " he asked her , with the affected pompousnesswhich he believed to be a component of wit , " that our relationship , beautiful as it is , may be due for a change ? " She looked up in surprise . " Oh , no . Why ? "  | " I wonder if even the strictness of your background can wall in your feeling for me . " " That feeling , " she said , smiling , " is like Edith 's toy poodle . I keep it at my side . With only a string for a leash . " There was a pause while he looked down , rather dramatically , to the ground . " You are schooled in cruelty . " She laughed . " I like you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to affect emotion . It makes everything nicer . " " It does , does it ? " " I think so , " she said . " Most people make a cult of sincerity . I used to . " She leaned back and looked at the stars . " What a mistake . From now on I 'm going to live in the eighteenthcentury . I 'm going to be a happy hypocrite . " " You do n't have to tell me that , you know , " he said insinuatingly . " You need n't try to fool old Frank . Do you think I was born yesterday ? " His sneer was suggestive . " Why do women have to dress up natural things in fancy clothes ? You know what you want . You all want it , too . Particularly the ones who 've been used to it . " She looked at him coldly . " Is there anything quite so boring , Frank , " she asked , " as loose generalities about sex ? " To her astonishment she felt his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try this on for a generality , " he said roughly . He pulled her forward , almost out of her chair , and kissedher on the lips . She wrenched herself loose . She stared athis face for a second and then slapped it viciously . " Damn you ! " she cried . " Damn you for a clumsy lout ! " Even Frank had to recognize that this was not coyness . He held a hand to his cheek . " What the hell ? " " Does that convince you I 'm not one of your cliches ? " she demanded.  |p226There  was a pause . " What sort of a girl are you , anyway ? " " An Easton Bay girl , " she retorted . " And what the hell sort of girl is that ? " But Sybil had already regained her calm . She was look-ingout over the bay , her arms stretched out on the arms of her chair . " A girl who does n't believe in fundamentals , " she said tersely . " Or in sex . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it . " She paused . " But you , Frank , were the serpentin the garden . You had to be cast out . " He looked at her as though she was out of her mind . " And you believe that crap ? " he asked in amazement . " That there 's no love in Easton Bay ? " " If I feel there 's none , " she said coldly , " then there 's none for me . " Frank complained the next day to Edith that Sybil Hilliardwas " nuts . " He explained to her what had happened , but to his irritation she only roared with laughter . " I suppose any woman who resists you is nuts , dear boy , " she said mockingly . " Sybil was taking you for a ride . " " Oh , she was n't kidding , " he said , rubbing his cheek . " I can promise you that . " " Well , anyway , it 's perfectly natural , " Edith continued . " She probably hates the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband left me . " " Yeah . For twenty-four hours . " She gave him an oblique look . " It 's a phase , " she said . " She 'll get over it . What she needs at the moment is something with pants that can take her out without molesting her . " " And where , " he sneered , " are you likely to find that ? " Edith shrugged her shoulders . " She 'll find it , " she said . " And without any help from you.  |p227JUNE  WAS FOLLOWED by July , and the real summer heat descended on Easton Bay . It was a damp , dead heat , and the big trees around Aunt Jo 's house drooped . Even the well-raked blue gravel on the drive lost its luster . People began to disappear to Maine and Bermuda and the Cape , and Aunt Jo and Uncle Stafford went off for a month to stay at a large , airy clubhouse on the dunes at the Hamptons . When Sybil kissed her aunt good-bye in the front hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " I suppose you 'll live at Edith Kellogg 's while I 'm away . " " Not quite . " There was a pause during which Aunt Jo gazed at her with a funny , hard little smile . Sybil suddenly realized that it was an embarrassed smile . " I hope you do n't go there to see Howard Plimpton , " she said . Sybil laughed in sheer surprise . " Howard ? " she asked . " What on earth gave you that idea ? " " It was just a thought . Or should I say a worry ? " " Maybe a worry of yours , Aunt Jo . Hardly one of mine . " She found after they had left that she missed them . Thep228emptiness of the big house , bereft of her aunt 's energetic presence , served to intensify her own loneliness and irresolution . She dined in the evening with Nicholas in a rather stately way . He sat in his father 's place and she in Aunt Jo 's , and they regarded each other gravely over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interminably , about his law cases , about the store in London where he still bought his shoes , about the unfortunate state of repair of the other big houses in the neighborhood and the sad deterioration of the north shore of the island in general . He seemed to know that his conversation was of no interest to her , but he never blamed her . His large serious eyes , slightly mocking , seemed only to suggest that if she did not care to contribute to the subjects of their , conversation , she would have to be content with the humble fare that he offered her . It was , after all , his best . She was less amused by Edith 's parties after the incident with Frank Bayswater . It was not that she held this against Edith , but it had somehow discolored the atmosphere of her house , taking from it a part of the brightness and gaiety that she had found before . She was even becoming a bit bored with Edith herself who , after six or seven bold and striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meager supply of her charm . She was an admirable person , Edith , brave and bighearted , but what struck one after even a brief acquaintance was the surprising fact that she was dull . As Sybil looked about Edith 's living room , she began to wonder if this were not also true of her friends . Were they not fundamentally like Aunt Jo 's ? Did n't they have the same basic need for a handful of oversimplified premises ? She felt at times that her remarks had the same jarring effect on them as they did on the Hilliard aunts , that the bleakness of her own loss of faith could be as isolating in one milieu as the other . And why not ? If anyone was in the wrong , it was she.  |p229Her  feeling persisted that she and Howard were somehow in the same predicament . She had not seen him since their brief encounter at Edith 's , but she knew that Aunt Jo had guessed correctly and that her real reason for going there was her hope of seeing him again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meeting him coincidentally that she made , for the first time , a morning call on Edith . She found her and Frank Bayswater playing backgammon on the porch . " Hi ! " Edith called to her , as she moved four men on a throw of doubles . " Fix yourself a think . We 'll be going to the club in a minute . " Sybil sat down and watched them . Twice she opened her lips and closed them again . " Do you know where I can find Howard ? " she asked finally . Edith looked up in surprise . " Now what 's he done ? " " Nothing , " Sybil said quickly . " I wondered if he would let me see his paintings . " " He 'd probably be delighted , " Edith said , throwing her dice again . " Amateur painters do n't have that commendablereticence that amateurs in the other arts are blessed with . He 's outside on the lawn . " When Sybil left , Frank looked up at Edith and winked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , sarcastically . " Whatever Howard may be , Frank , " she said meaningfully , " he 's not clumsy . Of that , my dear , you may be quite sure . " Sybil found him standing before an easel on the part of the lawn from which , through a vista in the trees , he had the widest view of the bay . He turned around as she came up and nodded . It was his own particular nod , more of an acknowledgment than a greeting . It committed him to nothing.  | " Do you mind if I sit here and watch ? " she asked . " I do n't mean the picture , " she added . " I mean the process . " He looked back to his canvas . " Not in the least . " She sat down on the grass and looked out at the bay . " Do you mind if I talk from time to time ? " she asked . " You do n't have to answer , you know . " " Sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " " This is n't one of my serious jobs . " " But there are serious ones ? " He shrugged his shoulders . " Serious to me . Not to anyone else . " " Oh , come , " she protested , to keep him talking , " Edith tells me you 're good . " " Edith knows nothing about it , " he said flatly . There was something restful to her in his concentration , in the very fact that it was a bad picture and that he did n't care . When he stood still , he was very still ; his thick , muscularframe seemed integrated with the heat of the day . If he moved his arm , he moved it quickly , almost impatiently , as if in deprecation of the petty human work of picturization that he was engaged in . The sweat stood out in beads on his round , unshaven cheeks ; it glistened on his temples by the roots of his hair . " Why do you paint ? " she asked . " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why indeed ? " He looked around , as though to see if she looked as fatuousas she sounded . " Why do you sit there and ask me questions ? " he asked . She pulled up a clump of grass and scattered it beside herfeet . She was not going to let him make her mad again . " Because I 'm bored , " she answered . " And because it 's hot . And because I find you interesting . " " Why interesting ? "  |p231She  pondered . " Maybe because I feel that nothing that I could ever say would shock you . " He turned again and looked at her more inquiringly , takingher in , in his blunt , unapologizing way , for the first time that day . " Are you going to tell me that you find me attractive ? " he asked . There was no sneer in his tone . " Would you like me to ? " He turned back to his canvas . " I accept situations , " he said tersely . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run after you ? " " How like a woman , " he muttered , " to put one in the wrong . No , I 'm not claiming anything , Sybil , " he continued . " I get along . That 's all . " " Well , I 'm not going to tell you that I find you attractive , " she said decisively . " I 'm tired of attractive men . I married one . " He started to work on the sky in his picture . " Do you find Philip attractive ? " he asked . " Still ? " " Do n't you think he is ? " " I never do much thinking about people like Philip , " he said carelessly . " What 's there to think about ? " For all her effort , she felt a stab of resentment . " Who are you to look down on Philip ? " she asked . " What have you done with your life to be so superior ? " He shrugged his shoulders . " If you 're still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " why do n't you go back to him ? " " That 's my business ! " " And I have mine , " he retorted , turning back to his landscape . " If you 'll let me get on with it . " Her irritation collapsed . " I 'm sorry , " she said lamely . " I seem to get wrought up over nothing . It must be the heat . "  | " Skip it . " " It 's silly of me to take on so about Philip , " she continued . " Particularly when , deep down , I feel the way you do . " Howard stood looking at his landscape , but she could see that he was not concentrating . She had apologized and she had done it handsomely ; it was up to him now , with all his indifference to convention , to say something . " It 's not that I have any particular feeling about Philip , " he explained , rather awkwardly . " It 's the whole group of which he 's part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . It 's harmless , really . " " You mean he 's a stuffed shirt ? " " That 's your phrase , Sybil . Not mine . " She sighed . There was something in the unchallengeable sincerity of his tone and the broad coverage of his remarks that made other standards seem inadequate . He had stepped over the border and was grazing placidly in the empty fields of his own emancipation . She had a longing to implicate him , to make him share her responsibility . " What should I do , Howard ? " she appealed . " Should I leave him ? " " Have n't you ? " " I could go back . " He turned to his pallette and mixed his paints . " Do you want to ? " " No . " " Is n't that your answer , then ? " " Is that the only standard ? " she asked . " What we want for ourselves ? " " What else ? What other people want for us ? " She brushed this aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that I have any obligation to stay with Philip ? " " I do n't think anyone has any obligation to stay with anyone . "  | " Not even for Timmy 's sake ? " " Who 's Timmy ? Oh , your son . " He reached into his box for another paint . " Well , I do n't believe in sacrificing everything for children . They can take their chances with the rest of us . " " Your children , " she retorted , " seem to be taking theirs with Mabel . " He turned and looked at her for a moment . His blue eyes seemed to be draining the spite out of her question , consideringany residue of interrogation that there might be left . Yet in the very steadiness , the very blueness of his stare she became for the first time aware of a resentment that he might be feeling , a resentment against the world from which he appeared to have cut himself off . " My children , as you say , are with their mother , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is usually with you . " " But he 's with the Hilliards now , " she cried . " And I hate it ! " He turned back to his picture . " I have no place for the children , " he said . " Mabel has . Besides , she 's going to marry again . After the divorce . " " You do n't mind her supporting them ? " She could hardly believe that she had said it . It was as if the spirit of Philip 's aunts had suddenly descended upon her and was speaking , like a ventriloquist , through her lips . " Money is money , " he said briefly . " I do n't worry about source . " " Oh , Howard , I 've hurt you , " she said , jumping up and going over to him . " I 'm a bitch . But it 's because I 'm all upsetinside . When I see anyone taking these things in their stride I want to strike out and hurt them . But you can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brush and folded his arms . " Are you trying to reform me , Sybil ? " he asked . " What 's this all about ? " Gip234She shook her head violently . " You 're wrong , Howard , " she protested . " It 's quite the contrary . I want you to reform me . I 'm tired of pros and cons and wondering what I should do . And what I should feel . I want to learn to live with myself . Will you help me ? " For the first time that morning he came out of his isolation . He frowned , and then , quite suddenly , there was a relationship between them . " I ca n't help you , Sybil , " he said . " I ca n't help anyone , really . Look at my own life . " " But it has n't got you down , Howard ! That 's the point ! " " Has n't it ? " He put his hands in his pockets , and walkeda few paces off from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turningaround and dismissing the note of introspection , " we can befriends . And that , in Easton Bay , is something . Already . "  |p235HOWARD  WAS ONE to accept a situation readily , and after their conversation on Edith 's lawn he took it as a matter of course that Sybil should come over each day and talk to him while he painted . In the evening they would drive to a local roadhouse and drink beer . Edith was quick to sense that their relationship was special ; she decided to leave them to themselves . She could see that Sybil was intriguedby Howard , but she had more difficulty in making out what he thought of her . He was not articulate in personalmatters . " She 's all mixed up , poor creature , " she told him one day . " I hope you 'll be nice to her . " " I 'm mixed up , too , " he retorted . " We 're all mixed up . " " All the more reason to be nice to her . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked irritably . " Because you 're so damn theoretical , my dear . " It was certainly true that Howard was theoretical . It made him , even to Sybil , a frequently exasperating companion . There was no axiom that he was willing to take for granted , no idea , however casually brought forth , that he was not ready to explore by the standards of his new emancipation.  | " Why do you say I ought ' ? " he was continually asking , or " What do you mean when you say a person is good ' ? " Sometimes , when she was anxious to get on with the discussion she found this trying , but she was always humble . She had enrolled , after all , as his pupil , and it was to be expected that the course would have its trying moments . Howard , when he got started , which was not an easy thing for him , was apt to hold forth on what he considered the errors of his own bringing up . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he put it , was so full of false values that a lifetime was needed to slough them all off . He compared himself to a person who has been saved by an extensive surgical job , but who is incapacitated thereafterfor normal life . " They got the Chelton out , " he would say , " but the patient almost died in the process . " Sybil , of course , had no partiality for Chelton , the school that had separated her from Teddy , but it was nonetheless a part of the nostalgia of her childhood , and she remembered her visits there in the springtime with a certain swelling of heart . She was not willing to throw quite as much into the junk heap as he . There were things , even in the Hilliard world , to which she still clung , and it often occurred to her that he might be going too far . One by one , painstakingly and conscientiously , he seemed to be jettisoning every principle of their joint background . Some of them came . out easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same careful treatment . His only fear was that he might miss one . Yet despite all he could do there was a certain hard core of the unreconstructed Cheltonian that he could never entirely obliterate . He was like a man sitting in a crowded street car , refusing , for some odd principle and greatly to his own discomfort , to give up his seat to a woman . " But everybody in the older generation is n't a hopeless case , " she protested one night . " My Aunt Jo , for example . She 's a snob , I grant , but that 's not the whole story . She 's warm and kind and generous to all of us -  " Like the Pharisees . " She looked about the smoky little room with its four other tables , its stained red and white tablecloths , its nickelodeon that never worked . She reflected how stubbornly he always refused to go to the other roadhouse , the nicer one , because the summer people went there . It was really a night club , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadhouse . " If she was your aunt , you 'd see what I mean , " she said . " It 's not a question of whose aunt she is , " he said . " I know your Aunt Jo . I 've known her all my life . She thinks that caring about who she sees and what sort of a car she drives and how the lawn looks are the minor things of life . Minor , but rather charming . " He shrugged his shoulders . " But she 's eaten up with them . They all are . Her whole group . They 'd be nothing without them . " There was a long pause as she took this in . " I think that 's very rude of you , Howard , " she said finally . " You know how much I care about her . " He put his elbows on the table , holding his beer level with his eyes and stared at the glass . " I thought you wanted to talk about things the way they are , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go out with people who tell you nice things , why do n't you ? I 'm not begging you to stick around . " She breathed deeply and picked up her cigarettes to put them in her bag . She pushed her chair back , as if to get up . " I wonder if you realize what you 're doing to yourself , Howard , " she said . " When you said that about Aunt Jo , you knew it was going to hurt me . You did n't really want to say it , either . I know that . Fundamentally , you 're soft as an old pillow . But you made up your mind that it was foolish of me to have illusions and foolish of you to respect them . And you made yourself say it . " He turned and gave her his most deliberate stare . " Is n't that what you wanted of me , Sybil ? "  | " Not at the risk of your hurting yourself , " she said . " You count for something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me . " " I do , though . Is that forbidden ? " He shrugged his shoulders . " I guess that 's your business . " There was a long pause . " You must be very bored with me , Howard , " she said dryly . " It 's been good of you to give me so much of your time . " He moved uncomfortably in his chair and then , looking up at the waiter , signaled for two more beers . " I 'm sorry , Sybil , " he said brusquely . " I have n't been very nice . But I like you . " He glanced at her and smiled with embarrassment . " You 're a good girl . You really are . " It was the first compliment that he had ever paid her , and she was almost too pleased to speak . " What do you mean by good ' ? " she asked , and they both laughed . For the rest of that evening they talked pleasantly about painting and Edith and Easton Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the routine of Nicholas ' day . When she got home that night she walked up and down the terrace alone , smoking and considering their relationship . She had made up her mind earlier that year that she could never again fall in love . She had felt that such an event would be not only impossible but immoral . Now she was less sure , at least as to the first . Underneath the exhilaration that his grudging compliment had given her there was a disappointment in herself that after what Philip had meant to her she could still feel exhilaration at a compliment , but this , surely , was only the price that a person like herself should i have expected to pay . It was all very difficult , but when had emotion been easy ? She idealized Howard , and she knew that it irritated him , but she was not going to give it up forp239that . If she could enjoy seeing the polite and inhibited boy who had been so independent of his contemporaries in the truculent man who took her to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , she knew what people said about women in her position , that they , were likely to tumble into anyone 's arms , and she supposed there was some truth in it . But what was love and what was honor and what was loyalty  --  well , she was tired , and it was all beyond her . When she went to bed that night she took a sleeping pill and made her mind a blank . The next evening , however , the issue of their relationship was presented in a different light . At the roadhouse , as they were getting ready to leave , he suggested that she spend the night with him . His expression was very serious ; there was no implication that he took such things lightly . " Oh , Howard , I do n't think so , " she said nervously , inadequately . " I really do n't . Though I suppose I should have expected this . " His eyes were fastened on her . " What else could you possibly have expected ? " he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you . What other relationship is possible ? " She looked miserably around the room . " I suppose I thought we could be friends . " Howard , however , could be extremely doctrinaire in questions of sex . As he had once told her , satisfaction in this was the nearest thing to a duty that he recognized . " We 've been friends , Sybil , " he explained . " Now we come to the point . It 's rather futile if we do n't . Perhaps you think I 'm cold . " He gazed down into his beer . " But I 'm quite sure that I could satisfy you . I think you can trust me in these matters . " " Oh , it 's not that , Howard , " she said , putting her hand on his arm . " Or that I do n't like you . No , I assure you , it 's not that . " She closed her eyes in a sudden seizure of giddiness.  | " It 's very much the opposite . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You mean you 're afraid ? " She shook her head , her eyes still closed . " Maybe . I do n't know . " If he had only put his arm around her or even put his hand on hers , or addressed one kind word to her , she might have given in . She knew this now , and her head throbbed with the knowledge . But what made the whole thing so utterly hopeless was her sudden sense , as she opened her eyes and saw him look away , that he knew it , too . It was not that he was too cold or too indifferent to play his part with more feeling ; it was his own deliberate choice to be that way , to take no advantage , to avoid even the tiniest cloud of sentiment on the wide , clear sky of his realism . She sighed and took out a handkerchief to wipe her nose . The gesture ended the scene between them . " Do you have much success with women , Howard ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She had never actually seen him blush before . " Edith ought to keep her mouth shut . " " But do you ? " He shrugged his shoulders angrily . " I get along . What the hell , Sybil ? What 's it to you ? Obviously , I 'm not going to have success with you . " " You do n't try very hard , " she observed dryly . " You mean I do n't talk pretty ? " he retorted . " No . Howevermuch I may have bored you , at least I 've spared you that . " She closed her bag as if preparing to leave . " A pity , " she said . He put his change down on the table by the check and pushed his chair back . " It would n't do any good if I started now , would it ? " he asked  |p241She  hesitated . Just for a moment . " No , I do n't think it would , " she said . On the drive back they talked very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speculated on whether she would marry Frank Bayswater whom he described , with his usual charity , as an ass . Sybil looked out into the night and reflected that Frank at least believed in something . Even if only in his own fictional popularity . The next morning she ran into Edith at the grocer 's , and they talked , as they rarely did , about Howard . " I 'm delighted , you know , that you and Howard are getting to be such friends , " Edith said brightly . " He needs someone to look after him . But I 'm sure you wo n't mind a word to the wise from an old pal . " She dropped her voice the least bit and looked straight at Sybil . " What you and he make of your friendship , my dear , is your own affair . But this much I will say . Do n't take him too seriously . " Sybil put her package down on the counter and returned Edith 's look . " Too seriously ? " she queried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I may have , Edith . But why is Howard not a person to be taken seriously ? " " Because he 's a louse , " Edith explained quickly . Then she laughed nervously . " Are n't we all ? " Sybil turned away from the counter . " Well , the first advance wo n't be made by me , " she said . " If that 's what you 're worried about . " Edith laughed again . " Oh , I 'm not worried about that , " she said . " I 'm only worried about him . He 's really quite wonderful , you know , my terrible cousin . I 'm in love with him myself . And that 's incest . "  |p242PHILIP  WAS NOT enjoying his summer . He had spread his vacation over a series of long weekends rather than taking it all at one time . There had seemed no point in wasting a whole month if he could not go away on a cruise . Of course , he could have done this , but his mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the legal settlements had been made . " Indifference , " of course , had been her word . She always put things crudely . He was not indifferent to Timmy at all , but he was accustomed to seeing the boy for short periods in the evening , and it bored him terribly to have to take him to the beach and watch him . It was easier for everybody , including Timmy , if he let him play with Lila 's children by the family pool . Lucy made short shrift of his scruples . " Do n't think you can turn yourself into a nursemaid , " she warned him . " You have n't the patience . Or the skill . Now get your golf clubs and go off some place where poor Timmy does n't have to wear himself out being a joy to you . " Philip took her advice , but he found himself resenting what he considered the false position in which Sybil had placed him . A father could not be expected to fuss over a child as a mother did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he wanted the child at all . Of course , he wanted the child ; he would have hated to relinquishcustody of Timmy . He knew that the time would come when he would be very proud to go up to Chelton to watch him play football . If Timmy ever did play football . If he did not turn out , that is , to resemble too closely his unpredictablemother . Never had Philip had Sybil so much in mind as during that summer . He could not reconcile himself to the completeness of her independence . He could not conceive that she had really forgotten him . He had driven over to the beach-club dance at Easton Bay one Saturday night , having heard that she was going to be there . Easton Bay was regarded in Glenville as hopelessly dowdy , but Philip had always liked it . It had some of the charm that Sybil had originally had for him , the charm of the subdued , the good and , above all , the admiring . He had joined an old college classmate and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in with a large group of people led by a tall , raw woman who was dressed entirely in white and who smoked on the dance floor . Sybil 's own appearance took him utterly by surprise . She looked bored and even sophisticated ; it was obvious , too , that the man who was with her found her attractive . She did not appear to have looked in Philip 's direction or to have seen him , yet when he cut in on her , a few minutes later , she did not seem at all surprised . " Thank you , Frank , " she said casually . " Oh , but look . Here 's an old friend . " The man released her and nodded to Philip . " Well , do n't slap him , anyway , " he said to Sybil , winking . " Never fear . He 'd slap me right back . He 's my husband . " The man called Frank gave Philip a quick , surprised lookand disappeared . " Who 's the guy ? " Philip demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What did he mean about not slapping me ? " She shrugged her shoulders . " It was necessary for me , a little while back , to administer a rebuff . " Philip 's face darkened . " What goes on around here , anyway ? " She shook her head several times . Slowly and patiently . " Nothing , my good Philip , " she said . " I can assure you , nothing at all . How is Timmy ? " " Oh , Timmy 's fine . " " And Julia ? " " I have n't gone back to Julia , " he retorted . " I thought someone told me you had . " " I do n't repeat myself , " he snapped . " I see . Good for you . " There was nothing more satisfactory than this in their conversation , and he returned to his table , greatly irritated . His mood was not improved , either , when he heard from his classmate 's wife , a prim , earnest Easton Bay wife and mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the kind of thing you ought to know about , Philip , " she said gravely . " They go around together all the time . And you know what his reputation is . " Philip did n't know , as a matter of fact , but he was soon brought up to date . He had known Howard at Chelton , and he had liked him in an impersonal way . They had played together on the football team , but he had not kept up with him since , and he knew nothing of his career of emancipationbut the few facts , unfavorably presented , now offered for his consideration by his friends . What rankled particularlywas that Sybil should have transferred her affections to another graduate of Chelton . He had always assumed that she would never look at another man , but that if she did , it would be a bohemian , an artist , a person , in short , whomp245someone like himself could not be expected to take seriously . But this was different . This was serious . The next morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing . After breakfast he went into the living room where he found his mother sitting on the sofa , her shoes off , doing the crossword puzzle in the morning paper . Arlina was sitting at the other end of the sofa strokinga spaniel . She was now an oversized but rather pretty girl of nineteen , with messy bobbed hair and the appearance of one who has just been interrupted roughhousing . She clung to her mother even more than her older sisters did , which Lucy found very trying . Lila was sitting on the floor reading a comic , which , at thirty-two , was still the only part of the Sunday paper that held her interest . It was very hot , and the French windows looking over the lawn to the big meadow with its potato fields and round clumps of trees were opened wide . From time to time a faint breeze percolatedthe room and stirred the great crowded Gobelin tapestry that hung on the wall behind Lucy 's sofa , ripplingthe faces of Alexander 's warriors as they advanced to anni- hilate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What have any of you heard about Sybil ? " he asked , standing before the sofa , his feet apart . " I 've been hearing this and that . I suppose the husband is always the last tofind out . " His mother looked up at him reflectively . Then she filled in a word in her puzzle . " You mean about Plimpton , I suppose ? " " Oh , him , " Lila said , as if she had been expecting something better . She went back to her comic . " Well , what about him ? " he asked irritably . " Your dear aunts were the first to tell me about him , " Lucy answered . " Trust them . Of course , I was dying to hear all about it , but I could n't resist the opportunity of telling them that I , at least , took no interest in gossip . After all , one rarelyp246has a chance like that to slap them down . " Arlina laughed and put her spaniel down on the floor . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must have glared ! " Philip threw his hands in the air . " Ca n't we stay on any point for any time ? " he protested angrily . " To hell with the aunts . What did you hear ? " Lucy put down her puzzle . " I did n't hear much , as I say , " she said . " Simply that she was seeing a great deal of Howard Plimpton who has deserteda perfectly good wife of his own . Partnership in crime , I suppose . " " Just seeing ? " Philip demanded . " Now do n't be fierce , dear , " Lucy said soothingly . " Your old ma has n't let you down . I did n't like to ask people because I did n't think it came well from me . But I 've done all right by you . I 've hired a detective , and he 's taken a room at Easton Bay . Apparently Jo Cummings has a gardener who 's touchable Philip 's eyes were wide . " Mother ! " he exclaimed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lila exchanged glances . " It 's routine , Phil , " Lila pointed out . " We did it in my divorce . " " It is n't as if we 'd ever use this evidence , " Lucy explained . " Or even as if Sybil will ever know that we have it . It 's a matter of being prepared . Do n't forget , my boy , this is war . Separations are always war . " " But we ca n't spy on Sybil ! " he cried . " It 's not fair . What has she done , after all ? " " It 's abominable ! " exclaimed Arlina . Arlina had never ventured to criticize her mother before , but in the sudden tenseness of the atmosphere her unprecedentedoutburst went unnoticed . Lucy slapped her hand down on the newspaper in her lap.  | " I was afraid you 'd be this way , Philip , " she said . " That 's why I did n't tell you in the first place . We women have to do all the dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget , my child , all the questions that have to be decided between you and Sybil . How much she 's going to get , for example . Who gets Timmy . If you can put yourself in the driver 's seat by spending a few hundred dollars on a detective , it 's idiotic not to . " He hung there before her , undecided , swayed by the power of her logic . " But suppose Sybil has done nothing ? " he asked . " And suppose she finds out ? " " Well , since you put it to me , I think she 's done plenty , " Lucy retorted . " I do n't say I can prove it yet , but give me time . " " You 've never been consistent about Sybil , " he said hotly . " You thought that she was terrible at first . Then you were all for her . Now you 're down on her again . How am I to know how you stand or what it 's worth ? " Lucy stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , the only person in the world whom she cared for more than herself . " You can be sure of one thing , my child , " she said gravely . " And that is that I 'm doing my best for you . That 's how I stand and what it 's worth . " He turned away from her and left the room . He had a dim , angry sense that these were problems that he should be working out for himself , but there was , as always , a part of him that felt exactly as his mother felt . He did want to know , damn it all , what Sybil was up to , and if she was up to what Lucy thought she was , then he wanted to use proof , however obtained , in the way that would most hurt her . But it was obnoxious , nonetheless , to be in the position of a spy , and it was still in his heart to feel a pang at the thought of Sybil , who had tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardener . Yet what else could she expect ? 1 lad he not eaten humble pie and begged her to forgive Mini ? " To hell with her ! " he kept muttering to himself . " She asked for it , did n't she ? " Later that morning he said this aloud to Lila on the golf course . " But why get all stewed up , Phil ? " she asked . " It 's just a formality . I 'll bet she 's having you watched . " This was a new and sobering thought , but he was sure , even as it came to him , that Sybil would never descend to such a level . There was no point , however , explaining this to Lila . Like Lucy , she would never understand . Arlina Hilliard was even more upset than her brother . Sybil had been the only member of the family who had ever rivaled her mother in her affections . She went out riding by herself that morning to consider in all its horror the full effect of Lucy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious and when she was not , but she hardly thought that even Lucy would joke about a matter like this . Desperately she took jump after jump , higher than any that she had ever dared before , as if to lift herself above the world of hate and suspicion that had so suddenly opened up to her . Later in the day , lunching at the beach with a girl friend , she poured out the whole story , telling it as if it had happened , not to her family but to another . The friend sided immediately with the wife in the story . " If I were the husband 's sister , " she said , " I would n't warn the wife directly . That might be disloyal . But I would certainlysee to it that the information got to her . " " You would ? " " Of course , I would . How else could I call myself her friend ? " Arlina clenched her fists . " And she is my friend ! " she cried . " She was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me at school recess to tell me when she and Philip were engaged ! " She clapped her hands over her mouth , but the other girl only laughed and told her that she had guessed the secret anyway . Arlina was too miserable really to care . She turned away from her , plunging her fingers into the sand , and contemplatedonce more the extraordinary inequity of a world where her mother and Sybil could not be friends. iip250SHORTLY AFTER Aunt Jo returned from the Hamptons , Millie came down to Easton Bay with her two children to spend a week and to get away from the cares of housekeeping . She filled the house with an atmosphere of small , neat details and small , exact arrangements and took over , as if by right , the position of senior niece . Aunt Jo , who was capable , in detached moments , of laughing at Millie , was nonetheless flattered and pleased by the constant attention that Millie paid her , an attention , it was true , that seemed premised on the idea that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally , be poured out in return to a young wife and mother , so fragile , so charming and so anxious to do only what was right . Like Sybil earlier in the summer she spent her time entirely with Aunt Jo and with Aunt Jo 's friends , but whereas Sybil had been a taciturn and rather sardonic witness of their daily round , Millie , fluttering and pleased and admiring , was immediately taken to their hearts with an enthusiasm that owed at least some of its clamor to the contrast thus afforded to her sister-in-law . " You 're not nice to that girl , Sybil , " Aunt Jo warned her one night after she had spent the evening playing solitaire , gloomily aloof from the family group . " You 'll regret it onep251day . You 've only got one brother , you know , and you should n't antagonize his wife . " Sybil bowed her head . " I know , " she said sullenly . " I 'm awful . " " Are n't we feeling just a tiny bit sorry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sybil had one hand on her doorknob . " Oh , Aunt Jo , " she said heatedly . " Ca n't you leave me be ? " And she went into her room and closed the door behind her without even saying good night . It was the first time she had ever been so rude , and she stood for two minutes without moving , trembling at the revelation of what seemed to be happening to her . Things came to a head towards the end of Millie 's visit at a cocktail party which Aunt Jo gave for her . There was no need for Aunt Jo to give cocktail parties when she , unlike the younger generation , was still in a position , with her large house and accommodating servants , to entertain her friends at lunch or dinner , but she liked the idea because she found it modern and a trifle dashing . Her friends felt the same way , although they seemed , unlike Lucy Hilliard 's friends , to have little enough use for cocktails ; they stood in pairs and trios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all could have been seated , in their largest and most shining hats , some with cocktail glasses but more without , talking as earnestlyand excitedly as though they had not met , the day before , at a similar party in the house of another friend . Sybil , standing by herself , looked about the room and wondered why she still cared enough to come . She saw Philip 's aunts come in , Miss Emily with her quick , jerky stride , waving her arms at Aunt Jo and smiling in anticipation of their imminent embrace , like a great actress in private life who knows , while pretending not to see , that every eye is on her , and Miss Harriet , nodding from side to side , plodding along , picking up the pieces , so to speak , and consoling herself with thep252thought that if her world was not as romantic as her sister 's it was at least more real . Sybil shrank back and let Millie greet them . Millie was good at such things ; she went up to the Misses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them in a lively way that seemed designed to meet Miss Emily on her own plane and perhaps a little to distract her attention from Sybil 's truculence . Well , it was Millie 's world . Millie , however , could not linger long with the Misses Hilliard . She took her position of guest of honor very seriouslyand moved from group to group , staying only long enough to hear a single anecdote to which she would listen or give the appearance of listening , with a drawn , rapt expression that broke , as the story reached its climax , into a series of little panting gasps , the components of what she secretly regarded as her enchanting and infectious laugh . Sybil , watching her , wondered if Millie ever really heard what was being said to her . It seemed as though her small quantity of concentration must have been used up in the effort of demonstrating her reaction , in the study of just when and how to throw back her head and shatter the pale generality of her attention with the myriad particulars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was conveyed to Millie across the room through the jangled atmosphereof so many words and laughs , for she glanced at Sybil several times , a bit uneasily , and finally came over to her . " You know , Sybil , " she said , holding her cocktail glass close to her chin as though it were a fan that she was coyly allowing to rest there , " is n't it silly ? Here we are , staying under the same roof , and I feel that a crowded party is my only chance to have a word with you . " Sybil looked at her suspiciously . " A word about what , Millie ? " " Oh , a word about anything ! " " I remember one of our last talks , " Sybil said with a touchp253of bitterness . " You told me about Philip and Julia . What have you to tell me today ? " Millie looked at her with the wide , half-smiling eyes of the timid who know , half in embarrassment , half in a kind of fascinated pleasure , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate me for that , Sybil ? " she asked . " Of course , you must . Yet I wonder . After all , you hated me before . " Sybil felt the sudden weariness of having , so unprepared , to take anything like this up . " I have n't at all , Millie , " she said . " You 're being absurd . " But Millie only shook her head briskly . " Oh , no , I 'm not , " she said in a high , bright voice . " You 've never thought that I was the girl for Teddy . I know . But then it 's possible , is n't it , Sybil , that you do n't know your brother as well as you think you do ? We all have our childhooddreams , and Teddy , I suppose , was yours . Is n't that true ? " She nodded , still smiling , as though to answer herself . " But people do grow up , I 'm afraid , in the end . It 's one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't turned into your Teddy , it 's quite possible , is n't it , that he may be a better Teddy ? Or must he be a worse one ? " Sybil knew that one could n't argue with Millie ; she had no sense of the scheme of things , and when her small , metallic mind hit upon a truth , the unexpected illumination served only to emphasize the darkness of the shadows . " Please , Millie , " she begged . " I do n't want to talk about it . If I 've been a fool about you and Teddy , then I 've been a fool . But if it 's the past , why must we bother with it ? " Millie stared at her for a moment . " There 's no reason , I suppose , " she said in a disappointed tone . " And , of course , Aunt Jo said none of us should plague you . I know you 've had a miserable summer . " Sybil almost smiled at the satisfaction in her tone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been most enjoyable . " " Oh , Sybil , you ca n't say that ! "  | " Ca n't say what ? " " You ca n't say , " Millie explained in her quickest , most nervous tone , " that all this business at Edith Kellogg 's has really been enjoyable . " " All what business ? " " Sybil , I sometimes wonder if you do n't forget who you are , " Millie answered , adopting for her own protection a complacent , older sister 's tone . " A girl who 's married to Philip Hilliard ca n't be as free as a girl who is n't . Do you think , for example , that he does n't know everything that 's going on here ? " She paused for effect . " I can assure you that Arlina Hilliard hinted very broadly to me the other day at the golf club that if you knew what was best for you , you 'd watch your step . " Millie had put her glass down on a table as she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew how , bracingherself for what she felt sure would be the fury of her rejoinder . Sybil had turned very pale . " You mean Philip 's trying to get something on me ? " she asked . " Arlina did n't explain what she meant , " Millie answered with dignity . Sybil turned away from her . The sudden force of the contrastbetween what Philip had meant to her and what he was now doing made her dizzy . She leaned against the bookcaseand shook her head so abruptly when Millie followed her that the latter , hurt , turned back to the party . Left to herself , Sybil breathed deeply and lit a cigarette . It was only another thing to get used to , after all . Another step in the process of her adult education . She looked about at Aunt Jo 's friends and thought bitterly how many of their children had been divorced , had had affairs , had done all the things that they went through the form of constantly deploring . But it was different with their children ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marrying and giving in marriage as shown by the very frequency with which they went through its forms . What , in both generations , they could all scent out and resent was a defection that was fundamental , a defection that manifested any loss of faith in the elementary optimism of family chatter , in the idea that everyone was really " all right , " that even with ups and downs , given half a chance , they would somehow settle down . There was plenty of room for Philip , even for Julia , in their world . But was there room for anyone who despised the subterfuges and proclaimed openly her own disillusionment ? Disillusionment with what ? Why , with everything ! She rubbed her brow . Was she beginning to crack ? And was she not even hoping that she would crack ? Her mind seemed to be skidding around in smaller and smaller circles . She went over and stood at the sideboard by the shaker and drank her fourth strong Martini in quick nervous sips . Such a procedure did not pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out of the corners of their eyes until the moment when , nodding to each other , they moved over to stand between her and the room , shieldingher from inquiring eyes . " My dear , " Miss Emily began , shaking her head , " I hate to see a young girl taking more than one of those things . I know that everyone seems to do it these days , but does n't that just make it worse ? " " Are you going to warn me , too , Aunt Emily ? " Sybil demanded . " Millie tells me the Hilliards have me under the strictest observation . They want me to slip . Is n't that it ? " The sisters exchanged significant glances . " If you mean that we 're all interested in your welfare , my dear , " Miss Emily answered , " then , of course , you 're right . I hate to see any member of the family drinking . " Sybil looked defiantly from one to the other . She remem/bered how much she had wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first years of her marriage . She marveled at the time she had wasted . " What do you really think of me ? " she asked boldly . " Do tell me . Please . " She could see by the glitter in their eyes and their embarrassedsmiles that she had shocked them . Being shocked , however , was not for them an unpleasant experience . It amused them to gaze down from the unassailed citadel of their virginity to the flat , dry plane of domestic discord and hear one of the younger generation shouting up at them with a rudeness that was in itself an admission of inferiority . " I do n't think I like your tone , Sybil , " Miss Emily reproved her . " One does not ask such questions of one 's elders . At least one never did when I was a girl . " Sybil looked at their stiffened jaws , their expanses of flowered print , their big , black shiny hats as if through a haze . " I wonder if you 'd ever have spoken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Everyone in the Hilliard family makes up to you both because they 're after your money . But you want that . You knew from the beginning that I was n't interested in your money , and you thought there was something queer about it . " She threw back her head and gave a sudden laugh . " Oh , how I see it now ! " she exclaimed . " You 'd rather be liked for your money than for yourselves ! There might be something impertinent in somebody'sliking you for yourselves . It might be pity . " For just a moment , as she faced Miss Emily and brought this out , there was a sense of communication between them . Not so with Miss Harriet , the prosaic and resolute , who had already turned away with the air of disgust of the man who can not stand scenes . But Miss Emily had a certain intelligence and on those rare occasions when she allowed it to peep out from behind the thick curtain of her preconcep/tions she was capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could see now , outraged as she had been , that the poor creature who had so outraged her was unhappy and needed help . But it was only for a moment . Then the word " pity " burst in upon Emily Hilliard with its full force . " If anybody is to like you , my child , " she said grimly , " it will have to be for something besides yourself . " Once again Sybil was left alone , and she drank another cocktail . She was trembling now from head to foot . It was madness ; there could be no question about it after what she had said . But she was no longer redeemable , which made it easier than when she had been rude to Aunt Jo . The sky behind her was aglow now with the crackle of burning bridges . If it was strange and terrible , there was also exultationin it . She turned away from the party and went into the front hall . She was fumbling in her bag for the key to her car when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going out for dinner ? " he inquired politely . " I 'm going out . " " Ca n't I take you ? " he suggested . " We could dine at a place I know near Glenville . They have excellent oysters . " She found her key and turned back to face him . " You 're being very kind , Nicholas , " she said . " But you 're afraid I 'm drunk and that I 'll wreck my car . And I do n't care . Ca n't you see that ? I do n't care ! " He nodded , as in perfect comprehension . " That is very little consolation , you will admit , " he said , " to those of us who do . " She stared into the half-abashed sympathy of his sad eyes and felt , just for a moment , the impulse to surrender to them all . Then she shook her head impatiently . " Oh , you do n't care , Nicholas ! " she exclaimed . " None of you care ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . You ca n't imagine how sick of it ! "  |p258She  hurried out the door and into her car . How she got down the drive she did n't know ; she remembered afterwards the roar of the blue gravel as she sped around the corners at a speed that had never before so insulted its raked orderliness . She went to the roadhouse that she always went to with Howard and drank three cups of black coffee at the counter , looking dolefully at the pale face and messy hair in the mirror opposite her . She decided that she looked picturesquely desperate . Howard was home and answered the telephone when she called . She was very aggressive . " Where are you anyway ? " she demanded . " Why do n't you come down here and buy me a drink ? " " It does n't sound as if you needed one . " " Well , are you coming ? " she asked . " Or are n't you ? Do you want me to drive up and get you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to live . Stay where you are . I 'll get someone at Edith 's to run me down . " He came , and they sat at their usual table while she poured forth , in a rather confused manner , her low opinion of the Hilliard family , her own family and of herself . He had several drinks , but he refused to let her have anything but one glass of beer . By eleven o'clock she was slightly more sober but no calmer . " Well , if you wo n't let me drink , " she said at last , " there 's no point in our staying here . " He paid the check and took her back to her car . He got in himself , however , and took the driver 's seat . For a few minutes they drove along in silence . " But where are we going ? " she asked as she suddenly recognized through the rapidly turning headlights the familiar rhododendrons of Aunt Jo 's drive . " I do n't want to go home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where do you want to go ? " " I want to go to your place , " she said peevishly . " Howp259dense can a man be ? I want to go to your place and have a drink . " He stopped the car and turned it around . " Very well , " he said . " To my place . " " Well , do you mind ? " " You 're very belligerent tonight , Sybil , " he said quietly . " No , I do n't mind . " When they drew up before the garage in which he lived he sat for a moment at the wheel . " Look , Sybil , " he said . " I do n't want to take advantage of you . You 're still plastered . " " Look who 's being a gentleman ! " she sneered . " Is this your liberation ? Is this your emancipation ? " " I do n't have to be consistent , " he retorted . " I live by my own standards . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she exclaimeddefiantly . " Least of all yours ! " She went up the outside stairway to his rooms , and she heard the click as he turned off the lights in the car and closed the door . Before she reached the landing she heard his step immediately behind her . He turned the key in the lock and opened the door for her , switching the light on as she stepped over the threshold . She wanted too much and yet nothing . She wanted to be drowned in the eddying green sea of the music of Tristan that she had loved as a child in Aunt Jo 's box ; she wanted to die like Isolde of a love that was identified with the black enveloping honesty of night . There was an element of the indecent , of the suicidal , in her gasping search for an obliterationof her own unfaithfulness to love , and kind as he was , and experienced as he was , he would not allow her to lose herself in him . She could feel that he was holding her back ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they werep260doing was that and just that , and as she lay back afterwards in the darkness , feeling the throb between her head and the pillow and the thick , slow tears in her eyes , she knew again that she had no one to blame but herself . When she got up she dressed alone in the dark without speaking to him . She put her clothes on hurriedly in her need to get away as fast as she could . He was lying on the couch , smoking . " You do n't have to hurry off , you know , " he said . " It 's early still . " " I 've got to get home . " " It 's never what you think it 's going to be , is it , Sybil ? " he asked . " Relax . The world is n't going to come to an end . " " I 'm not at all sure . Not at all sure . " There was a long silence . When he spoke again there was a note of detached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , would n't you ? " She turned towards him , stung . " I 'm not the only one who misses things , " she retorted . He sat up . She heard his laugh . " Do n't run off , Sybil , " he said in a more kindly tone . " Wait a second . I 'll drive you home . " " I want to be alone ! " she said fiercely . " Alone ! " She went out the door and slammed it behind her . She paused at the top of the stairway and looked up into the moonlight , defiant of eyes in the darkness . Then she hurrieddown the steps and into her car . As she started off , she rolled down the window and let the cool bay breeze ripple her hair . If there was anything wrong , she kept repeating to herself as she drove along , it was the fault of romanticism . A romanticism that she despised for having sunk her in the void where she now found herself . But there it remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , she asked herself angrily , fixing her eyes on the fleeting grey of the side of the road , but to be held like a trembling bird in ap261large , inert human hand ? Or the sense of turning in a ballroomto a waltz or driving along the seashore with the wind in her hair ? Or sitting alone by the radio in Uncle Stafford 's library and listening to Beethoven and thinking of what she had originally thought of Philip ? What a fool she was . What an absolute fool . When she had left her car in the middle of Aunt Jo 's turnaroundand crossed the gravel to open the front door , she saw that the lights were on , not only in the hall but in the living room . She went to the door of the latter and found Nicholas playing solitaire at the card table in the corner . " You have n't waited up for me ? " she asked . He mixed the cards on the table before him with a quick gesture of his long , thin hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said calmly . " You know how badly I sleep . " She walked into the room and faced him . " But you did wait up ? " she insisted . He looked at her and smiled his usual smile . " Surely that 's my prerogative , is it not ? " he asked . " I 'm not , after all , a child . " She went over to the card table and sat down , leaning her head on her hands . " Oh , Nicholas , " she groaned . " I 'm such a bitch . You have no idea . " " You always exaggerate , Sybil . You always have . " She looked up at him for a long moment . It was there , in his eyes , that family faith that dogged her steps , that faith that she , like all cousins , was surely more sinned against than sinning . " If I could only marry you , Nicholas , " she said suddenly , " perhaps I could be saved . Would you , Nicholas ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Would you , please ? I 'd change my whole life . I 'd be good . Good as you ca n't believe . "  |p262He  turned very red . He got up and moved instinctively towards the door . " Sybil ! " he exclaimed . " You do n't know what you 're say-ing ! " Too much had happened to her , however , for her to care what she said . Or what she destroyed . " I 've never known better ! " " You must go to bed , " he said in a hoarse tone . " You must go upstairs this minute ! Or I 'll have to call your aunt . " She shrugged her shoulders and walked past him into the hall to the big winding stairway with the white bannister . As she passed each of Aunt Jo 's paintings , the cows and the landscapes and the very red cardinals , the shepherds in the fields and the winsome girl on the doorstep with her dog , she reflected , but not very steadily , that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was she ? Alas , and she shook her head bitterly , she was nowhere.  |p263WHILE  PHILIP AND ARLINA were having breakfast , two days later , on the terrace their mother came out and handed Philip a letter . She sat down opposite him and watched his face cloud as he read it . " Well ? " she asked . " Well , what ? " " You said I was prejudiced against her . You said that I was absurdly suspicious . " She shrugged her shoulders . " Now you can see for yourself . " " I can see that your man has been very thorough , " he said bitterly . " I imagine you have had to pay high . " " But you should n't believe people like that ! " Arlina cried unexpectedly . " They get paid more if they turn things up , do n't they ? Do n't they ? " she repeated shrilly . Lucy and Philip both looked at her in astonishment . The Hilliards had a way of discussing private matters in family conclave , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do n't at all , Arlina , " Lucy said sharply . " And I doubt if you know a thing in the world about it . " Arlina blushed and looked down through the glass top of the table at her feet . " Anyway , I 'm fed up with the whole business , " Philip con/tinned angrily to his mother . " It makes me feel like a worm . I 'm going over to see Sybil and have this thing out with her . Once and for all . " He got up . " Do n't be a fool ! " Lucy exclaimed . " Do you want to ruin everything ? How do we know we have enough proof ? " " It 's enough for me . " " But , Philip , is it enough legally ? " she protested . " Wait a few more days , darling , and I guarantee you 'll be in a position to " " I should n't have listened to you in the first place , " he interrupted . " The whole damn business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into the house . A moment later they heard the sound of his car starting . There was an angry spurt of gravel as he drove off . " He 'll ruin everything , " Lucy wailed . " The big ox ! " Arlina was sitting quietly in her chair , still staring down at the terrace . " He 's right , Mummie , " she said in a low voice . " You should have left Sybil alone . " Lucy looked around again at her youngest child . It was the second time in her life that the girl had dared to talk back to her . " And just what do you know about it , young lady , I 'd like to know ? " she demanded . " I know that if you want Sybil back , you 're not going about it the right way . " Lucy stared . " But I 'm not at all sure that I do want her back . " Arlina folded her napkin with exaggerated dignity and rose to her feet . " In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left the table . Lucy looked after her in amazement . A sharp retort died on her lips . Then her anger subsided , and she even managed a laugh.  | " Well , I 'll be damned ! " she exclaimed to herself . " I 'll be damned . " When Philip pulled up before the doorway of Aunt Jo 's house in Easton Bay he did not even get out of his car . He blew the horn until the old butler , scandalized , appeared . " Will you tell Mrs. Hilliard that I want to see her right away , " Philip called to him . " I 'll see if she 's up , sir . " " Well , wake her up if she 's not . " The butler disappeared immediately , and a few moments later Sybil came out of the house and walked slowly over to his car . " Our separation has not improved your manners , " she said , putting her hands on the door . " Aunt Jo was wondering if you could possibly be sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said shortly , " and I did n't want to go into the house . " She considered this a moment and nodded . " I see , " she said . " In that case I 'd better get into the car . " She came around to the other side , opened the door and got in . She took a cigarette from her pocket and pressed in his automatic lighter . " Well ? " " I want to know what 's between you and Howard Plimpton , " he said , leaning his arms against the wheel and looking ahead down the drive . " I want to know what the hell you think you 're up to . " She lit her cigarette . " I thought you had people who told you things like that . " He stared . " People ? " " You know what I mean , Philip . " " How do you know that ? " he demanded . " Who told you ? " " I do n't see any reason why I should tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd come to me in the first place and asked me , it might have been different . "  | " When I asked you at that party at the beach club what was going on , you said nothing . " " Well , it was true . Then . " " Am I expected to believe that ? " he demanded hotly . " You 're expected to believe anything you want to believe . " " Are you being honest , Sybil ? " " I 've always been honest , " she retorted . " I would n't expect you to know what that means . " He gripped the wheel tightly and said nothing for several moments . Then he glanced at the pale face beside him . " I suppose I do n't know what it means to have my wife carry on a perfectly open affair with a guy like Howard Plimpton , " he said angrily . " If it was open , why spy on me ? " " Because I need evidence that I can prove in court ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have done the same thing with Julia . Then the shoe would have been on the other foot . " He had not come prepared to be thoroughly hateful , but then he had not anticipated her attitude . " That 's right , " he said nastily . " And you 've missed the boat , kid . You 've missed it plenty . I had thought we could work things out , but I thought wrong . What I 'll have to do now is have the lawyers draw up an agreement and send it to you to sign . " " You mean an or else ' proposition ? " " Exactly . " " Giving you , I suppose , custody of Timmy ? " " You said it , " he snapped . " You can send me agreements till you 're blue in the face , Philip Hilliard , " she retorted . " But I shall never sign away custody of my child ! Never ! " " Would you rather have a court do it ? " " Much rather ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " A lot of very nasty things could come out , you know , " he warned her . " The papers would make a lot of it . " " That will be your responsibility , Philip . Not mine . " " Their eyes met , and her stare was defiant . He looked away and shrugged his shoulders . " You can let me know , " he said , " if you decide to be reasonable . " " " You have my answer . " She got out of the car after saying this and went back into the house . Inside the door she waited until she heard him drive away . Then she returned to the breakfast table . " Was that Philip ? " Millie asked . She nodded . " Does he always blow his horn instead of ringing the bell ? " " Invariably , " she said and turned back to the newspaper . After breakfast she went to the library and sat there alone for half an hour . She looked up at the bronze stag on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rows of biographiesand court memoirs , at the painting of Uncle Staffordin a leather jacket with his pipe and book ; she tried to invoke the spirit of sympathy that must somehow inhabit a room that had been so much a part of herself . Yet it was not there . The things repudiated her . That morning , in the village , she ran into Howard at the grocer 's . " I apologize for my rotten temper the other night , " she said . " It was inexcusable . " " Is this be-nice-to-Howard week ? " he - asked . " It 's be-nice-to-everyone week . " " You 've decided that Aunt Jo 's world is your world , after all ? " She looked at him thoughtfully . " Oh , I do n't know about that , " she said . " Besides , I mayp268be thrown out of it . Would you mind if Philip named you as co-respondent in a divorce suit ? " He stiffened . " Does Philip know ? " he demanded . She nodded . " How ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breath . " I did n't know he 'd be such a bastard . " Then he shrugged his shoulders . " Well , of course , I do n't mind . I have nothing to lose . But what about you ? " As she looked at him she saw that he did mind . He hated to be involved . Oh , he would be good about it , he would do anything that she asked him . He would even go to see Philip , if it came to that . But it was obvious that he hated the idea of having to play a forced role in what he regarded as the rigmarole of a pointless legal proceeding . She felt the sterility of his independence . She could look at him steadily now . She could even smile . " Should I go back to him , Howard ? " she asked him for the second time . " Do you want to ? " They were still standing where they had met , before the counter . " We always do what we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " She nodded to him and went out of the store.  |p269PHILIP  DECIDED after his interview with Sybil that he was a very wronged man . He was wronged by his wife and wronged by his mother and wronged , as far as he could make out , by all members of both families . No matter what turn events seemed to take , he continued to be blamed for everything . He had tried to be nice to Sybil , and he had been spurned . When he had reproached her , he had been spurned again . Everyone , it seemed , talked at the top of their voices where his marriage was concerned . It was intolerable . " You 'll have to get one thing into your head , Ma , " he told Lucy the next morning . " And that is that I refuse to discuss Sybil with you any more . I really mean that . " " Listen to him ! " she exclaimed . " I hope you do n't think that I want to discuss your affairs . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . " " Well , the mess will be my mess , " he said sulkily . " All yours , my boy , " she said crisply . " Every bit of it . " He lunched that day in town with Teddy and told him the whole story . Teddy had been forewarned by Millie ; he was not taken by surprise . " The whole thing 's out of control , " Philip protested , al/most childishly , as he finished his tale . " You 'd think she wanted me to divorce her on those grounds . But I do n't , Teddy . You know I do n't . All I want is to have her admit that now we 're in the same boat . But no . Shouts and screams . All the time . What the hell 's eating her ? " " You hurt her , Phil . Remember that . " " I hurt her ? " Teddy smiled at the look of surprise on his brother-inlaw'sface . " Have you forgotten about Julia ? " " That ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , that 's ancient history . Since then I 've eaten crow . What the hell more do you want ? Do n't you Rodmans have any normal impulses ? " Teddy laughed . " I hope we . do , " he said . " Or at least I hope I do . But Sib has her pride , Phil . It 's a terrific pride . And when she cares about somebody the way she cares about you ... " " Cared , you mean . " " No , Phil , cares . Why in God 's name do you think she 's been acting this way ? " Philip threw his hands in the air . She loves me so much that she sleeps with Howard , " he said sarcastically . " Is that it ? " " That 's it . " Philip looked uncomprehendingly at the assurance on Teddy 's face . " I must be most unsubtle , " he said . " I do n't get it . " Teddy nodded . " You are unsubtle , Phil , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory , however , was far from unpleasant to Philip . It solaced him where he had been most hurt . For if Sybil really still cared , if that was the explanation of herp271smarting coolness and promiscuous conduct , he would be able to condone with dignity what she had done . For Philip , in spite of everything , still wanted to save his marriage . He detested more than ever the wrangling atmosphere between the families and his dependency on Lucy to provide a home for Timmy . All he wanted was peace . If Sybil , the strange and more interesting Sybil whom he had seen that summer , would only meet him halfway , surely something could be worked out that was better than their present separation . When he drove up to the house at Glenville that evening , Arlina , who had been waiting in the hall , came out to meet him as he got out of his car . " Phil ! " she said . " Phil , I 've got to talk to you . " " " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she insisted , holding him back as he started towards the house . " Very important . " " You 're in love , " he suggested sarcastically . " Is that it ? " " Oh , no , Phil . No ! " He stopped and looked at her . It occurred to him that they all treated Arlina rather shabbily . " What is it , sweet ? " " It 's about you . No . It 's really about Sybil . " He frowned . " Look , Lina , do n't you hear enough about love under the Japanese lanterns at your deb parties ? Run along , kid , will you ? " She shook her head violently . " But you do n't know ! " she cried guiltily . " You do n't know ! " He stared at her . " Do n't know what ? " " It was I who told Sybil about the detective ! " she almost shouted . And with this , she burst into tears , hanging her head down in sudden misery.  |p272Phili|p  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone 's reaction to his problems . He sighed and put his arm around her shoulders . " It does n't matter , Lina , " he said . " I knew she knew . She told me so . Calm down , kid . What did you do ? Write her ? " Arlina paused between sobs . " No . I saw Millie Rodman . I told her to tell her . But that 's not the worst of it , Phil . " She looked up imploringly and then threw her arms around him . " Oh , darling Phil , can you ever forgive me ? " " Lina , for Christ 's sake . " He tried to disentangle himself . " Will you calm down , please ? What more do you have to tell ? " She took the handkerchief that he offered her and blew her nose . " Well , you see , I wrote her before it happened , " she said finally , looking down at the grass . " Before what happened ? " " Before the thing happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tensely . Philip 's mouth opened . " You did ? " " And that 's why it happened , Phil ! Do n't you see ? " She began to get excited again . " It 's all my fault ! " She looked up at him with a misty defiance , as sudden and unexpected as her humility . " What the hell are you driving at , Lina ? " " Oh , Phil , do n't you see ? She thought you trusted her . She thought she had deserved at least that . And then she hears that you 're spying on her . Crash . " Arlina drew herself up as though to emulate a stage heroine whose world has collapsed into dust . " She turns to the nearest man . If that 's what you 're going to think of her , she 'll give you something to think about ! Why not ? She throws herself at Howard 's head . "  | " Lina , for the love of mike " If you only knew Sybil as I knew her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the nobility of her nature ! But what 's the use ? You wo n't forgive . You wo n't see . You wo n't understand . And who can blame you ? You would n't really be Phil , I suppose , if it were otherwise . " She turned sadly away from him , overcome with the intransigencyof the opposite sex . " Will you dry up , Arlina ? " he called after her . " Will you dry up , please ? "  |p274PHILIP  MADE UP HIS MIND quickly about things , but , having done so , he left no stone unturned to accomplish his purpose . He knew that he would have to be generous , for the simple reason that Sybil was in the wrong . When he decided to be generous , however , his direct nature enabled him to be very much so . He went into the library after dinner that night and wrote her a letter . " I want to assure you , in the first place , " he said , " that I have no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was originally Mother 's idea , not mine . I am not , however , trying to shirk responsibility for it . When I found out about it I should have stopped it at once , but at the same time I heard you were seeing Plimpton , and I was so angry that I let Ma have her way . I know it 's a hard thing to forgive , but all I can do is hope that you 'll forgive it . I 'll give you a divorce , Sib , if you still want it , and Timmy can live with you during the school months . Surely that 's fair . But what I really want is to have you both back with me and everything the way it used to be . I know you 've had a lot to put up with , but if you could see your way to giving me another chance , I really think that we could work things out . " When he reread the letter he was quite moved by it . Hep275put it in an envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . When he came back he had a pleasant sense of irrevocability , and he sat down again at the library desk to write the other letters which were to buttress his scheme . He wrote to his mother-in-law in Canada , to his father-in-law , to Aunt Jo and to Millie . He even induced himself to write to Nicholas which , all things considered , was handsome of him . He explained to each of them how distressed he was by the continued separation ; he described the offer that he had made to Sybil and expressed his hope that they would add their voices to his to persuade her to come back . " I know that she 's the best wife a fellow could have , " he wrote . " It 's my misfortune that I have discovered it too late . " The reaction to his letters was varied . Aunt Jo was very touched ; she handed her letter to Sybil at the breakfast table and simply murmured : " I hope that you will give this serious consideration , my dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm convinced of it . " " George Rodman was similarly convinced of his son-inlaw'ssincerity , but then he had been mystified from the beginning by Sybil 's attitude . He and Esther discussed the matter one night at their Canadian hotel . " Where does she think she 'll get another husband like Philip ? " he demanded . " She 's crazy , that girl . " " Maybe she does n't want one . " Esther glanced over the neat lines of her son-in-law 's handwriting . " IIe 's awfully prosy , you know . I could never count-on a man who was prosy . " George looked at his wife and scratched his head . " Well , she may snap my head off , " he said , " but I 'm still going to write her and tell her not to be a fool "  |p276Sybil  read her letters with an odd sense of detachment . She was surprised to receive Philip 's , and she was impressed with its magnanimity . She saw its prosiness , as did her mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to write it , but this did not alter the fact that he was throwing away a trump card and doing it in full awareness of the consequences . Philip had his honesty ; she knew that . As each additional letter came in and as she traced the careful , almost childish plan that he had conceivedto win her back , she could not help smiling . " Aunt Jo , would you ever go back to a man who described you as a model of patience ' ? " she asked , quoting from Philip 's letter to Teddy which the latter had sent on to her . " The whole thing makes me sound like a Griselda . Which , God knows , I have n't been . " " You make fun of everything , Sybil , " Aunt Jo reprovedher . " And some day you 're going to be sorry . A fine literary I I style may not mean sincerity . " " You know , that 's where I think you 're wrong , Aunt Jo , " she said , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincerity . " But Aunt Jo was not listening . Nobody , as she saw it , would listen to her when Philip took his present tone , not even Teddy . The latter came down to spend a night at Easton Bay to argue it out with her . He had been working on a bond issue , night and day , and he looked tired . The sparkle of his college years had somewhat dimmed , but his smile , if less spontaneous , had much of its old charm . " I had lunch with Philip the other day , " he told her after dinner , when they were alone in the library . " We discussed the whole thing . " " Everybody has , " she said coldly . " Except , apparently , Philip and myself . " " I think that his attitude , under the circumstances , is generous . You must concede that , Sybil . "  | " Oh , I concede nothing , " she said impatiently . " To any of you ! " Teddy , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you be satisfied , Sib ? " he asked . " When Philip has divorced you and taken away Timmy ? When you 've got everybody in both families against you ? " She shrugged her shoulders . " You 've always been an appeaser , Teddy , " she said . " All your life . You 've always been for smoothing things out and patching things up . But I 'm different . Leave me be . " " I know you think my life is small and dull , Sib , " he said calmly . " But then it 's impossible for you to understand that I get what I want out of it . And that I gave up smoothingthings out . Long ago . " She knew that she had gone too far . She went over and sat beside him on the sofa where they had once looked at Uncle Stafford 's illustrated histories . " Teddy , I do n't think your life is small and dull , " she protested , putting her hand on his arm . " And you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life . And I like Millie , too . " He laughed . " Come , Sib . You do n't have to go that far . " " But I do , Teddy ! I do now ! " " All right , " he said soothingly . " You do . " " And I do believe that what you have means everything to you , " she continued feelingly . " And I 'm glad it 's that way . But you should try to understand me , too . Do you really want to send me back to a man I do n't love ? " " But you do ! " She stared at him . " I do ? " " Of course , you do . That 's what I was telling him the other day . " " You were telling him the other day ? "  |p278He  nodded . " Certainly , " he said , as if it were the simplest thing in the world . " I was trying to explain what 's been so obvious from the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . " She stared at him almost in fear . " Teddy , are you mad ? How could you say such a thing ? " As their eyes met she felt the strange intimacy of their mutual recognition that they did not , after all , really understandeach other : " Because it 's true ! " he retorted . " You 've always been in love with Philip ! And you know it too ! " She continued to stare at him as she realized that he believed it . Of course , he believed it ! So did they all , her father and Millie and Aunt Jo and Lucy Hilliard and even Philip himself . The crazy picture of her summer fell suddenlyinto place , and she knew at last what it was really like to be alone.  |p279SHE  MADE HER DECISION that night to go back to Philip . She lay awake until three in the morning and then came to her conclusion with a complete calmness of mind . As Teddy had implied , there was really no alternative . It was as simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was most anxious to bring back to the disorganized structure of her life . She had no illusion that her choice was dictated by any sense of morality or duty ; if there had been any real alternative , she could have adopted it and flouted the world . But could there ever be such an alternative for one who , like herself , had invested everything in a romantic myth ? One could call it neuroticism or even stubbornness , but labels did not help . She had only herself to live with . To Howard she gave hardly a thought . He had given her what anyone might have given her , a sense of his own uneasiness at being taken too seriously . It might be that things would not always be this way , but she was inclined to think they would . It was better to go back and tell Philip everything . Everything , that is , but the change in her feeling for him . To this extent she would lie , and for the first time . She would go along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have behaved , she still adored him.  |p280She  drove over to the Hilliards ' in the morning . In the front hall she met Lila who told her that Philip was outside with Timmy . She went out and around the house , to avoid Lucy , and found Philip in his bathing trunks sitting by the pool with his feet in the water , while Timmy and Lila 's children played on the grass beside him . Timmy was the first to see her , and he ran over happily . No effort had been made to explain the separation to him , and he had accepted it as a perfectly natural thing . As Lila 's children faced the same situation he had no sense of the unusual about it . " Mummie ! " he cried . " Look , Daddy , it 's Mummie ! Have you brought me a present ? " Philip turned around when he heard Timmy calling and flushed . He got up and ambled over and stood uncomfortablybeside her while she talked to the boy , who was telling her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been to . She leaned down while he told her about it and then gave him a kiss . " Darling , how wonderful . And now will you go and play with the other children ? Just for a bit . While I talk to Daddy . " Timmy ran off , and his parents faced each other . Philip looked very tan and well , and his hair was bleached by the sun . He pointed to the white chairs by the pool house , and they went over and sat down . He looked at her a bit sheepishly , but also , she thought , with a certain veiled truculence , as though ready for anything she might have to say . " Well , Sib ? What do you think ? " " I think you 've been very big about everything , Philip , " she said in a clear voice . " I think you 've been fine . I shall be very glad to come back . Truly . And I wo n't leave you again , no matter what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So there it was . She thought she could read in his embarrassedsmile , behind the pleasure that he obviously felt , the faintest hint of disappointment that this was all **26;6124;TOOLONG SHAH OF BRATPUHR , looking as tiny and elegant as a snuffbox in one end of the vast cavern , handed the Sumklish bottle back to Khashdrahr Miasma . He sneezed , having left the heat of summer above a moment before , and the sound chatteredalong the walls to die whispering in bat roosts deep in Carlsbad Caverns . Doctor Ewing J. Halyard was making his thirty-seventh pilgrimageto the subterranean jungle of steel , wire , and glass that filled the chamber in which they stood , and thirty larger ones beyond ' This wonder was a regular stop on the tours Halyard conducted for a bizarre variety of foreign potentates , whose common denominator was that their people represented untappedmarkets for America 's stupendous industrial output . A rubber-wheeled electric car came to a stop by the elevator , where the Shah 's party stood , and an Army major , armed with a pistol , dismounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we speed this up a little , Major ? " said Halyard . " We do n't want to miss the ceremony . " " Perhaps , " said the major . " But , as officer of the day , I 'm responsible for nine billion dollars worth of government property , and if something should happen to it somebody might be rather annoyed with me . The ceremony has been delayed , anyway , so you wo n't miss anything . The President has n't showed up yet . " The major was satisfied at last , and the party boarded the open vehicle . " Siki ? " said the Shah . " This is EPICAC XIV , " said Halyard . " It 's an electronic computing machine  --  a brain , if you like . This chamber alone , the smallest of the thirty-one used , contains enough wire to reach from here to the moon four times . There are more vacuum tubes in the entire instrument than there were vacuum tubes in the State of New York before World War II . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for the descriptive pamphlet that was passed out to visitors . Khashdrahr told the Shah . The Shah thought it over , snickered shyly , and Khashdrahr joined him in the quiet , Oriental merriment . " Shah said , " said Khashdrahr , " people in his land sleep with smart women and make good brains cheap . - Save enough wire to go to moon a thousand times . " Halyard chuckled appreciatively , as he was paid to do , wiped aside the tears engendered by his ulcer , and explained that cheap and easy brains were what was wrong with the world in the bad old days , and that EPICAC XIV could consider simultaneously hundreds or even thousands of sides of a questionutterly fairly , that EPICAC XIV was wholly free of reason-muddying emotions , that EPICAC XIV never forgot anything  --  that , in short , EPICAC XIV was dead right about everything . And Halyard added in his mind that the procedure described by the Shah had been tried about a trillion times , and had yet to produce a brain that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred opportunities . They were passing the oldest section of the computer now , what had been the whole of EPICAC I , but what was now little more than an appendix or tonsil of EPICAC XIV . Yet , EPICAC I had been intelligent enough , dispassionate enough , retentive enough to convince men that he , rather than they , had better do the planning for the war that was approaching with stupifying certainty . The ancient phrase used by generals testifyingbefore appropriation committees , " all things considered , " was given some validity by the ruminations of EPICAC I , more validity by EPICAC II , and so on , through the lengthening series . EPICAC could consider the merits of high-explosive bombs as opposed to atomic weapons for tactical support , and keep in mind at the same time the availability of explosives as opposed to fissionable materials , the spacing of enemy foxholes , the labor situation in the respective processing industries , the probable mortality of planes in the face of enemy antiaircraft technology , and on and on , if it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cocoanut Mound Bars and Silver Stars required to support a high-morale air force : - Given thep102facts by human beings , the war-born EPICAC series had offeredthe highly informed guidance that the reasonable , truthloving , brilliant , and highly trained core of American genius could have delivered had they had inspired leadership , boundless resources , and two thousand years . Through the war , and through the postwar years to the present , EPICAC 's nervous system had been extended outward through Carlsbad Caverns  --  intelligence bought by the foot and pound and kilowatt . With each addition , a new , unique individualhad been born , and now Halyard , the Shah , and Khashdrahr were arriving at the bunting-covered platform , where the Presidentof the United States of America , Jonathan Lynn , would dedicate to a happier , more efficient tomorrow , EPICAC XIV . The trio sat down on folding chairs and waited quietly with the rest of the distinguished company . Whenever there was a break in the group 's whispering , EPICAC 's hummings and clickings could be heard  --  the sounds attendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now blocking , shuttling through a maze of electromagnetic crises to a condition that was translatable from electrical qualities and quantities to a high grade of truth . EPICAC XIV , though undedicated , was already at work , deciding how many refrigerators , how many lamps , how many turbine-generators , how many hub caps , how many dinner plates , how many door knobs , how many rubber heels , how many televisionsets , how many pinochle decks  --  how many everything America and her customers could have and how much they would cost . And it was EPICAC XIV who would decide for the coming years how many engineers and managers and researchmen and civil servants , and of what skills , would be needed in order to deliver the goods ; and what I.Q. and aptitudelevels would separate the useful men from the useless ones , and how many Reconstruction and Reclamation Corps men and how many soldiers could be supported at what pay level and where , and . . .

The television cameras dollied and panned about him like curious , friendly dinosaurs , sniffing and peering . Lynn was boyish , tall , beautiful , and disarming , and , Halyard thought bitterly , he had gone directlyfrom a three-hour television program to the White House . " Is this man the spiritual leader of the American people ? ' asked Khashdrahr . Halyard explained the separation of Church and State , and met , as he had expected to meet , with the Shah 's usual disbelief and intimations that he , Halyard , had n't understood the questionat all . The President , with an endearing , adolescent combination of brashness and shyness , and with the barest trace of a Western drawl , was now reading aloud a speech someone had written about EPICAC XIV . He made it clear that he was n't any scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before this great new wonder of the world , and that he was here because American plain folks had chosen him to represent them at occasionslike this , and that , looking at this modern miracle , he was overcome with a feeling of deep reverence and humility and gratitude . . . Halyard yawned , and was annoyed to think that Lynn , who had just read " order out of chaos " as " order out of koze , " made three times as much money as he did . Lynn , or , as Halyard preferred to think of him , Planck , had n't even finished high school , and Halyard had known smarter Irish setters . Yet , here the son-of-a-bitch was , elected to more than a hundred thousandbucks a year ! " You mean to say that this man governs without respect to the people 's spiritual destinies ? " whispered Khashdrahr . " He has no religious duties , except very general ones , token ones , " said Halyard , and then he started wondering just what the hell Lynn did do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communications , Foodstuffs , and Resources Board did all the planning , did all the heavy thinking . And the personnel machines saw to it that all governmental jobs of any consequence were filled by top-notch civil servants . The more Halyard thought about Lynn 's fat pay check , the madderp104he got , because all the gorgeous dummy had to do was read whatever was handed to him on state occasions : to be suitably awed and reverent , as he said , for all the ordinary , stupid people who 'd elected him to office , to run wisdom from somewhere else through that resonant voicebox and between those even , pearly choppers . And Halyard suddenly realized that , just as religion and government had been split into disparate entities centuries before , now , thanks to the machines , politics and government lived side by side , but touched almost nowhere . He stared at PresidentJonathan Lynn and imagined with horror what the country must have been like when , as today , any damn fool little Americanboy might grow up to be President , but when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynn was explaining what EPICAC XIV would do for the millions of plain folks , and Khashdrahr was translatingfor the Shah . Lynn declared that EPICAC XIV was , in effect , the greatest individual in history , that the wisest man that had ever lived was to EPICAC XIV as a worm was to that wisest man . For the first time the Shah of Bratpuhr seemed really impressed , even startled . He had n't thought much of EPICAC XIV 's physical size , but the comparison of the worm and the wise man struck home . He looked about himself apprehensively , as though the tubes and meters on all sides were watching every move . The speech was over , and the applause was dying , and Doctor Halyard brought the Shah to meet the President , and the televisioncameras nuzzled about them . " The President is now shaking hands with the Shah of Bratpuhr , " said the announcer . " Perhaps the Shah will give us the fresh impressions of a visitor from another part of the world , from another way of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shah uncertainly . " He wonders if he might ask a question , " said Khashdrahr . " Sure , you bet , " said the President engagingly . " If I don'tknow the the answers , I can get them for you . " Unexpectedly , the Shah turned his back to the President andwalked alone , slowly , to a deserted part of the platform.  | " Wha 'd I do wrong ? " said Lynn . " Ssssh ! " said Khashdrahr fiercely , and he placed himself , like a guard , between the puzzled crowd and the Shah . The Shah dropped to his knees on the platform and raised his hands over his head . The small , brown man suddenly seemed to fill the entire cavern with his mysterious , radiant dignity , alone there on the platform , communing with a presence no one else could sense . " We seem to be witnessing some sort of religious rite , " said the announcer . " Ca n't you keep your big mouth shut for five seconds ? " said Halyard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glowing bank of EPICAC 's tubes and cried in a piping singsong voice : " Allakahi baku billa , Moumi a fella nam ; Serani assu tilla , Touri serin a sm . " " The crazy bastard 's talking to the machine , " whispered Lynn . " Ssssh ! " said Halyard , strangely moved by the scene . " Siki ? " cried the Shah . He cocked his head , listening . " SikiP " The word echoed and died  --  lonely , lost . " Mmmmmm , " said EPICAC softly . " Dit , dit . Mmmmm . Dit . " The Shah sighed and stood , and shook his head sadly , terriblylet down . " Nibo , " he murmured . " Nibo . " " What 's he say ? " said the President . " Nibo '  --  nothing . ' He asked the machine a question , and the machine did n't answer , " said Halyard . " Nibo . " " Nuttiest thing I ever heard of , " said the President . " You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers come out on tape from the whatchamacallits . You ca n't just talk to it . " A doubt crossed his fine face . " I mean , you ca n't , can you ? " " No sir , " said the chief engineer of the project . " As you say , not without the thingamajigs and whatchamacallits. " zo6 PLAYER PIANO " What 'd he say ? " said Lynn , catching Khashdrahr 's sleeve . " An ancient riddle , " said Khashdrahr , and it was plain that he did n't want to go on , that something sacred was involved . But he was also a polite man , and the inquiring eyes of the crowd demanded more of an explanation . " Our people believe , " he said shyly , " that a great , all-wise god will come among us one day , and we shall know him , for he shall be able to answer the riddle , which EPICAC could not answer . When he comes , " said Khashdrahr simply , " there will be no more suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Lynn . He licked his lips and patted down his unruly forelock . " How 's the riddle go ? " Khashdrahr recited : " Silver bells shall light my way , And nine times nine maidens fill my day , And mountain lakes will sink from sight , And tigers ' teeth will fill the night . " President Lynn squinted at the cavern roof thoughtfully . " Mmm . Silver bells , eh ? " He shook his head . " That 's a stinker , you know ? A real stinker . I give up . " " I 'm not surprised , " said Khashdrahr . " I 'm not surprised . I expect you do . " Halyard helped the Shah , who seemed to have been aged and exhausted by the emotional ordeal , into the electric car . As they rode to the foot of the elevator , the Shah came back to life somewhat and curled his lip at the array of electronics about them . " Baku ! " he said . " That 's a new one on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little interpreter , who had squared away Jonathan Lynn so beautifully . " What 's Baku ? " " Little mud and straw figures made by the Surrasi , a small infidel tribe in the Shah 's land . " " This looks like mud and straw to him ? " " He was using it in the broader sense , I think , of false god . " " Urn , " said Halyard . " Well , how are the Surrasi doing ? " " They all died of cholera last spring . " He added after a moment , " Of course . " He shrugged , as though to ask what else people like that could possibly expect . " Baku . "  |p107THE  KRONER HOME , just outside Albany , was a Victorian mansion , perfectly restored and maintained down to the filigree along the eaves , and the iron spikes along the roof peak . The archprophet of efficiency , Kroner , preferred it to the gracile , **28;6152;TOOLONG steel and glass machines almost all of the engineers and managers lived in . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  beyond saying that he liked lots of room  --  it was so in keeping with him that no one gave the anachronism more than passing thought . A portrait painter had sensed the rightness of the setting , with no clues other than Kroner 's face . The painter had been commissioned to do portraits of all the district managers . He did them from photographs , since the managers were too busy  --  or prudently claimed to be  --  to sit . Intuitively , the painter had depicted Kroner in a red plush chair , with a massive wedding ring prominently displayed , and with a background of heavy velvet drapes . The mansion was one more affirmation of Kroner 's belief that nothing of value changed ; that what was once true is alwaystrue ; that truths were few and simple ; and that a man needed no knowledge beyond these truths to deal wisely and justly with any problem whatsoever . " Come in , " rumbled Kroner gently , answering the door himself . He seemed to fill the whole house with his slow strength and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became , having replaced his double-breasted suit coat with a singlebreastedone of a slightly lighter shade and with suede patches at the elbows . The coat , he explained to visitors , was something his wife had given him years ago , something which he 'd only recently mustered nerve enough to wear . " I love your house more every time I see it , " said Anita . " You must tell Janice that . " Janice was Mrs. Kroner , who smiled sweetly from the living room . She was a fat repository of truisms , adages , and homilies , and was usually addressedby the young engineers and managers as " Mom . " io8 PLAYER PIANOp108Mom , Paul recalled , had never liked that Finnerty boy , who would never call her Mom nor confide in her . Once , after she 'd prodded him to unburden himself and feel better , he 'd rather testily told her that he 'd already fled one mother . Paul she liked , because Paul , as a youngster , had confided in her now and then . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her conveyedthat his failure to confide recently was n't due to revulsion , but to a lack of problems . " Hello , Mom , " said Paul . " Hello , Mom , " said Anita . " You children take a load off your feet , " said Mom . " Now just tell me all about yourselves . " " Well , we 've redone the kitchen , " said Anita . Mom was thrilled , eager for details . Kroner hung his huge head , as though listening intently to the small talk , or , more likely , Paul thought , counting away the seconds before it would be polite to separate the men and women  --  a custom of the house . As Anita paused for breath , Kroner stood , beamed , and suggested that Paul come into his study to see the guns . It was the same gambit every time  --  the men were to see the guns . Years ago , Anita had made the mistake of saying she was interested in guns , too . Kroner had politely told her that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always the same , too : " Oh guns  --  I hate them . I ca n't see why men want to go around shooting sweet little animals . " The fact was , Kroner never fired his guns . His pleasure seemed to be in owning and handling them . He also used them for props , to give an air of informality to his man-to-man talks . He announced raises and promotions , demotions and firings , and praised or warned , always in seemingly casual asides made while swabbing a bore . Paul followed him into the dark-paneled study , and waited for him to choose his weapon from the gunrack that filled one wall . Kroner ran his index finger along the collection , like a stick along a picket fence . It had been a matter of speculation among Kroner 's underlings as to whether there was any significancein the guns he chose for a particular discussion . Forp109a while the rumor was current that shotguns were bad news , rifles were good news . But it had n't withstood the test of time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breach , and squinted through the bore at a streetlight outside . " Would n't dare shoot modern ammunition in this one , " said Kroner . " Twist barrel  --  thing 'd go all to pieces . But look at that inlay work , Paul . " " Beautiful . Priceless . " " Some man spent maybe two years on it . Time did n't mean anything in those days . The industrial dark ages , Paul . " " Yessir . " He selected a cleaning rod and lined up on his desk top a can of oil , a jar of grease , and several cloth patches . " Got to keep after a bore , or it 'll pit on you just like that . " He snapped his fingers . He oiled a patch , twisted it about the tip of the cleaning rod . " Especially in this climate . " " Yessir . " Paul started to light a cigarette , and then rememberedAnita 's warning in the outline . Kroner drove the cleaning rod downward . " Where 's Ed Finnerty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . " " Police are looking for him . " " Really ? " Kroner slid the patch back and forth and did n't look at Paul . " Uh-huh . Now that he 's out of a job , he 's got to register with the police , and he has n't . " " I left him downtown in Homestead last night . " " I know that . I thought maybe you knew where he went . " Kroner had a habit of saying he already knew what he 'd just been told . Paul was sure the old man did n't really know anything about the night before . " I have n't any idea . " He did n't want to make trouble for anyone . Let the police find out that Finnerty was with Lasher , if they could . " Urnm hmmm . See that pit right there ? " He held the muzzle of the gun a few inches from Paul 's face and pointed out a tiny flaw . " That 's what happens if you let a bore go for even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yessir . " " He is n't to be trusted any more , Paul . He is n't right in hisp110head , and it would n't do to take chances with him , would it ? " " Nossir . " Kroner dabbed at the pit with the corner of a patch . " I supposedyou saw it that way . That 's Why it 's a little difficult for me to understand why you let him wander around the plant unescorted . " Paul reddened . No words came . " Or why you 'd let him have your gun . He is n't authorized for firearms any more , you know . Yet they tell me they found your pistol covered with his fingerprints . " Before Paul could order his thoughts , Kroner clapped him on his knee and laughed like Santa Claus . " I'n ; o sure you 've got a good explanation , I do n't even want to hear it . Got a lot of faith in you , my boy . Do n't want to see yc get into any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it ' : sort of up to me to watch out for you . " " That 's nice of you , sir . " Kroner turned his back to Paul , assumed a ready stance with the shotgun , and picked off an imaginary bird flushed from behind the desk . " Kaplowie ! " He ejected an imaginary shell . " These are dangerous times  --  more dangerous than you 'd suspectfrom the surface . Kaplowie ! But it 's also the Golden Age , is n't it , Paul ? " Paul nodded . Kroner turned to look at him . " I said , is n't this the Golden Age ? " " Yessir . I nodded . " " Pull ! " said Kroner , apparently imagining clay pigeons now . " Kaboom ! There have always been doubters , criers of doom , stoppers of progress . " " Yessir . About Finnerty and the pistol , I  --  " " Behind us now , forgotten , " said Kroner impatiently . " The slate is clean . As I was about to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead and took forward steps with stout hearts , in spite of the people telling them not to . " " Yessir . " " Kaplowie ! Some men try to make light of what we 're doing , what men like your father did , by saying it 's just gadgeteering , blind tinkering . It 's more than that , Paul . " PLAYER PIANO IIIp111Paul leaned forward , eager to hear what this extra quality might be . He 'd felt for some time that everyone else in the system must be seeing something he was missing . Perhaps this was it , perhaps the beginning of an overwhelming fervor like his father 's . " It 's a sight more than gadgeteering , I 'll tell you , Paul . " " Yessir ? " " It 's strength and faith and determination . Our job is to open new doors at the head of the procession of civilization . That 's what the engineer , the manager does . There is no higher calling . " Dejectedly , Paul let his spine sag back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rod and began swabbing the bore again . " Paul  --  Pittsburgh is still open . The field has been narrowed down to two men . " It was somewhat startling that he said it just that way , the way Anita had said he would . He wondered what it was she thought he should say in response . He 'd never given her a chance to say , and had n't read the outline . " It 's a wonderful chance to be of real service , " he said . He supposed that was pretty close to what she had in mind . Paul felt lightheaded , having borrowed Anita 's thoughts for want of enthusiasm of his own . He was being offered the Pittsburghjob , lots more money , and , since he would have risen so high with the greater portion of his life still ahead , the assurance that he would almost certainly go clear to the top . The moment of his arrival at this point of immense good fortune was curiously bland . He had known it was coming for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to promising it to him often  --  always in the name of his father . When advances had come , as now , there had been a vestigal sort of ritual of surprise and congratulation , as though Paul , like his ancestors , had arrived by cunning , tenacity , and God 's will or the Devil 's laxness . " It 's a tough decision , Paul , between you and Fred Garth . " Garth was a much older man , nearly Kroner 's age , manager of the Buffalo Works . " Frankly , Garth has n't got your technical imagination , Paul . As a manager he 's excellent , but if it was n't for prodding , the Buffalo Works would be just as it was whenp112he took over five years ago . But he 's steady and reliable , Paul , and there 's never been any question that he was one of us , that he put progress and the system ahead of his own interests . " " Garth 's a fine man , " said Paul . Garth was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have an anthropomorphic image of the corporate personality . Garth stood in relation to that image as a lover , and Paul wondered if this prevalent type of relationship had ever been given the consideration it deservedby sexologists . On second thought , he supposed that it had  --  the general phenomenon of a lover 's devotion to the unseen  --  instudies of nuns ' symbolic marriages to Christ . At any rate , Paul had seen Garth at various stages of his love affair , unable to eat for anxiety , on a manic crest , moved to maudlin near-crying at recollections of the affair 's tender beginnings . In short , Garth suffered all the emotional hazards of a perennial game of she-loves-me , she-loves-me-not . To carry out directions from above  --  an irritating business for Paul  --  was , for Garth , a favor to please a lady . " I 'd like to see him get the job . " " I 'd like to see you get the job , Paul . " Kroner 's expression indicated that the mention of Garth had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination and spirit and ability  --  " " Thank you , sir . " " Let me finish . Imagination , spirit , and ability , and , for all I know , I may be completely wrong in calling your loyalty into question . " " Loyalty ? " Kroner laid the shotgun aside and pulled up a chair to face Paul 's . He laid his big hands on Paul 's knees and lowered his thick brows . The situation had the quality of a seance , with Kroner as the medium . Again , as he had felt when Kroner took his hand at the Country Club , Paul felt his strength and will dwarfed by the old man . " Paul , I want you to tell me what 's on your mind . " The hands on his knees tightened . Paul struggled resentfully against the urge to pour his heart out to this merciful , wise , gentle father . But his sullenness decayed . Paul began to talk . His formless misgivings and disquiet of a week before , he realized , had shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast in another man 's molds . He was saying what Lasherp113had said the night before , talking about the spiritual disaster across the river , about the threat of revolution , about the hierarchythat was a nightmare to most . The way he phrased it , it was n't a condemnation , it was a plea for refutation . Kroner , his hands still on Paul 's knees , hung his head lower and lower . Paul came to the end , and Kroner stood and turned his back to stare out of the window . The spell was still in force , and Paul looked expectantly at the broad back , waiting for wisdom . Kroner turned suddenly . " So you 're against us . " " I did n't mean to say that , certainly . They 're questions that deserve some sort of answer . " " Keep to your own side of the river , Paul ! Your job is managementand engineering . I do n't know what the answers are to Lasher 's questions . I do know that it 's far easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always been questions , and men like Lasher ready to make trouble by askingthem . " " You know about Lasher ? " Paul had n't mentioned his name . " Yes , I 've known about him for quite some time . And , as of this noon , I know what you and Lasher and Finnerty were up to last night . " He looked sad . " As district industrial securityofficer , there is n't much I do n't know , Paul . And sometimes , like now , I wish I did n't know so much . " " And Pittsburgh ? " " I still think you 're the man for the job . I 'm going to pretend that you did n't do last night what you did , did n't say just now what you said . I do n't believe it came from your heart . " Paul was amazed . By some freakish circumstance he 'd apparentlyclinched the job  --  after having arrived with the vague intention of disqualifying himself . " This is the main stretch , Paul . Now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on the wagon , I suppose . " " It 's a little more complicated than that , I 'm afraid . In a very short while you managed to pile up a fairly impressive police dossier : the pistol , letting Finnerty into the plant , last night 's indiscretions  --  and , well , I 've got to be able to explain it all away to the satisfaction of Headquarters . You could go to prison , you know . "  |p114Paul  laughed nervously . " I want to be able to say , Paul , that you were doing special security work for me , and I 'd like to prove it . " " I see . " Paul did n't . " You 'll agree that both Lasher and Finnerty are dangerous men , potential saboteurs who should be put where they ca n't do any harm . " He took the shotgun down from the rack again and distorted his face as he cleaned around the ejector with a toothpick . " So , " he said after a few moments of silence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get you into a plot to sabotage the Ilium Works . " The door flew open , and Baer came in , grinning . " Congratulations , my boy . Congratulations . Wonderful , wonderful , won-derful . " " Congratulations ? " said Paul . " Pittsburgh , my boy , Pittsburgh ! " " It has n't quite been settled , " said Kroner . " But you said yesterday  --  " " A little something 's come up since then . " Kroner winked at Paul . " Nothing very serious , though , eh , Paul ? A little hurdle . " " Um , oh , I see , uh-huh ; a hurdle , a hurdle . I see . Um . " Paul was shaken and confused by what had just happened to him , and he hid his lack of composure behind a vacuous smile . He wondered if Baer had come in on cue . " Paul here had some questions , " said Kroner . " Questions ? Questions , my boy ? " " He wanted to know if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Baer sat on the desk and began taking kinks out of the telephonecord . He was thinking very hard , and from the man 's expression Paul could only conclude that the question had never come to Baer 's attention before . Now that it had , he was givingit his earnest consideration . " Is progress bad ? Uh-huhgoodquestion . " He looked up from the cord . " I do n't know , do n't know . Maybe progress is bad , eh ? " Kroner looked at him with surprise . " Look , you know darngood and well history 's answered the question a thousand times . " " It has ? Has it ? You know ; I would n't . Answered it a7p115thousand times , has it ? That 's good , good . All I know is , you 've got to act like it has , or you might as well throw in the towel . Do n't know , my boy . Guess I should , but I do n't . Just do my job . Maybe that 's wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , what say to a refresher ? " he said briskly . " I say yes to a refresher , " said Paul gratefully . Kroner chuckled . " There , there ; it was n't so rough , now was it ? " " Nope . " " That 's my boy . Chin up . " As Baer , Paul , and Kroner filed into the living room , Mom was telling Anita sadly that it took all kinds of people to make a world . " I just want to make sure everybody understands he invited himself , " said Anita . " Mom , there was n't a thing we could do about it . " Kroner dusted his hands . " Well , what say to a pick-me-up ? " " Wonderful , wonderful , wonderful , " said Baer . " Did you men have a good time with those awful gun ? " said Mom , wrinkling her nose . " Swell , Mom , " said Paul . Anita caught Paul 's eyes , and raised her brows questioningly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chair , exhausted , satisfied . Mom handed out small glasses of port , while Kroner tinkered with the phonograph . " Where is it ? " he said . " Now , now  --  right where it always is , on the turntable , " said Mom . " Oh yes  --  here it is . I thought maybe somebody else had been playing something since I used it . " " No . Nobody 's been near the phonograph since last night . " Kroner held the tone arm over the spinning record . " This is for you , Paul . When I said pick-me-up I really had this in mind more than the wine . This is meat for the spirit . This can pull me out of a slump like nothing I can think of . " " I gave it to him last month , and I ca n't think of anything that 's ever pleased him as much , " said Mom.  |p116Kroner  lowered the needle into the groove and hurried to a chair and covered his eyes before the music began . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudspeaker howled : " O00000000000h , give me some men , who are stout-hearted men , who will fight for the right they adore . . . " Paul looked around the room . Kroner was clumping his feet up and down and jerking his head from side to side . Mom was jerking her head too , and so were Baer and Anita  --  Anita more violently than any of them . Paul sighed , and began to jerk his head , too . " Shoulder to shoulder , and bolder and bolder , they grow as they go to the fore ! O00000000000h . . . " LYING ABED AFTER the stout-hearted men 's evening at the Kroner 's , Doctor Paul Proteus , son of a successful man , himself rich with prospects of being richer , counted his material blessings . He found that he was in excellent shape to afford integrity . He was worth , without having to work another day in his life , almost three-quarters of a million dollars . For once , his dissatisfaction with his life was specific . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by almost any man in any period in history . He had been told to turn informer on his friend , Ed Finnerty . This was about as basic as an attack on integrity could be , and Paul received it with the same sort of relief that was felt when the first shots of the last war were fired  --  after decades of tension . Now he could damn well lose his temper and quit . Anita slept  --  utterly satisfied , not so much by Paul as by the social orgasm of , after years of the system 's love play , being offered Pittsburgh . She had delivered a monologue on the way home from Albany  --  arecitation that might have come from Shepherd . She 'd reviewed Paul 's career from the instant of their marriage onward , and Paul was surprised to learn that his path was strewnp117with bodies  --  men who had tried to best him , only to be chagrinedand ruined . She made the carnage so vivid that he was obliged for a moment to abandon his own thoughts , to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went over the scalps she was counting one by one  --  men who had competed with him for this job or that  --  and found that they all had done well for themselves and were quite unbroken either financially or in spirit . But to Anita they were dead men , shot squarely between the eyes , and good riddance of bad rubbish . Paul had n't told Anita the conditions he would have to meet before he could have Pittsburgh . And he did n't intimate that he was going to do anything but take the job proudly , joyfully . Now , lying beside her , he congratulated himself on his calm , on his being wily for the first time in his life , really . He was n't going to tell Anita that he was quitting for a long time , not until she was ready . He would subtly re-educate her to a new set of values , and then quit . Otherwise the shock of being the wife of a nobody might do tragic things . The only grounds on which she met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he were to lose the rank it was frighteningly possible that she would lose touch with the world altogether , or , worse for Paul , leave him . And Paul did n't want either of those things to happen . She was what fate had given him to love , and he did his best to love her . He knew her too well for her conceits to be offensive most of the time , to be anything but pathetic . She was also more of a source of courage than he cared to admit . She also had a sexual genius that gave Paul his one unqualifiedenthusiasm in life . And Anita had also made possible , by her dogged attention to details , the luxury of his detached , variously amused or cynical outlook on life . She was also all he had . A vague panic welled up cold in his chest , driving away drowsiness when he would most have welcomed it . He began to see that he , too , would be in for a shock . He felt oddly disembodied , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any more . Suddenly understanding that he , like Anita , was little more than his station in life , he threw his arms around his sleeping wife , and laid his head on the breast of his fellow wraith-to-be . " Mmmmm ? " said Anita . " Mmmmmmm ? " " Anita  --  " Mmm ? " " Anita , I love you . " The compulsion was upon him to tell her everything , to mingle his consciousness with hers . But as he momentarily raised his head from the drugging warmth and fragrance of her bosom , cool , fresh air from the Adirondacks bathed his face , and wisdom returned . He said nothing more to her . " I love you , Paul , " she murmured . DOCTOR PAUL PROTEUS was a man with a secret . Most of the time it was an exhilarating secret , and he extracted momentaryhighs of joy from it while dealing with fellow members of the system in the course of his job . At the beginning and close of each item of business he thought , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , to hell with everything . This secret detachment gave him a delightful sense of all the world 's being a stage . Waiting until the time when he and Anita would be in mental shape to quit and start a better life , Paul acted out his role as manager of the Ilium Works . Outwardly , as manager , he was unchanged ; but inwardly he was burlesquing smaller , less free souls who would have taken the job seriously . He had never been a reading man , but now he was developingan appetite for novels wherein the hero lived vigorously and out-of-doors , dealing directly with nature , dependent upon basic cunning and physical strength for survival  --  woodsmen , sailors , cattlemen . . . . He read of these heroes with a half-smile on his lips . He knew his enjoyment of them was in a measure childish , andp119he doubted that a life could ever be as clean , hearty , and satisfyingas those in the books . Still and all , there was a basic truth underlying the tales , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal , not with society , but only with Earth as God had given it to man . " Is that a good book , Doctor Proteus ? " said Doctor KatharineFinch , his secretary . She 'd come into his office carrying a large gray cardboard box . " Oh  --  hello , Katharine . " He laid the book down with a smile . " Not great literature ; I 'll promise you that . Pleasant relaxation is all . All about bargemen on the old Erie Ship Canal . " He tapped the broad , naked chest of the hero on the book jacket . " Do n't make men like that any more . Well , what 's in the box ? That for me ? " " It 's your shirts . They just came by mail . " " Shirts ? " " For the Meadows . " " Oh , those things . Open them up . What color are they ? " " Blue . You 're on the Blue Team this year . " She laid the shirts on the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held one of the deep blue T-shirts at arm 's length . " Dear God in heaven  --  no ! " Across the chest of each of the shirts , in blazing gold letters , was the word " Captain . " " Katharine , they ca n't do this to me . " " It 's an honor , is n't it ? " " Honor ! " He exhaled noisily and shook his head . " For fourteendays , Katharine , I , Queen of the May and captain of the Blue Team , am going to have to lead my men in group singing , marches , greased-pole climbing , volley ball , horseshoes , softball , golf-ball driving , badminton , trapshooting , capture the flag , Indian wrestling , touch football , shuffleboard , and trying to throw the other captains into the lake . Agh ! " " Doctor Shepherd was very pleased . " " He always has been fond of me . " " No  --  I mean he was pleased about being a captain himself . " " Oh ? Shepherd is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old reflex , the wary reaction of a man who has beenin the system for a good many years . Being chosen to captainone of the four teams was an honor , if a man gave a damn120 PLAYER PIANOp120about such things . It was a way the higher brass had of showingfavor , and , politically , Shepherd 's having been chosen a captain was a striking business . Shepherd had always been a nobody at the Meadows , whose chief fame was as a pretty fair softball pitcher . Now , suddenly , he was a captain . " Which team ? " " Green . His shirts are on my desk . Green with orange lettering . Very vivid . " " Green , eh ? " Well , if one cared about such things , Green was the lowest in the unofficial hierarchy of teams . It was one of those things that was understood without anyone 's saying anything about it . Having looked this far into the piddling matter , Paul congratulated himself for having been named captain of the Blue , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most tone . Not that it made any differenceat all any more . Made none . Silly . To hell with it . " They certainly give you enough shirts , " said Katharine , counting . " Nine , ten , eleven , twelve . " " Nothing like enough . For two weeks you drink and sweat , drink and sweat , drink and sweat , until you feel like a sump pump . This is a day 's supply at the outside . " " Uh-huh . Well , sorry , that 's all there is in the box except this book . " She held up the volume , which looked like a hymnal . " Hi ho  --  The Meadows Songbook , " said Paul wearily . He leaned back and closed his eyes . Pick a song , Katharine , any song , and read it aloud . " " Here 's the song for the Green Team , Doctor Shepherd 's team . To the tune of the William Tell overture . " " The whole overture ? " " That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give it a try . " She cleared her throat , started to sing softly , thought better of it , and lapsed into plain reading : " Green oh Green oh Green 's the team ! Mightiest e'er the world has seen ! Red , Blue , White will scream , WhenThey see the great Green Team ! "  | " That 'll put hair on your chest , Katharine . " " Oh , gosh but it 'll be fun ! You know you 'll love it when you get up there . " Paul opened his eyes to see that Katharine was reading anothersong , and her eyes shone with excitement and she rocked her head from side to side . " What 's that you 're reading now ? " " Oh , I wish I were a man ! I was just reading your song . " " My song ? " " The Blue Team 's song . " " Oh  --  my song . By all means , let 's hear it . " She whistled a few bars of " Indiana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh you Blue Team , you tried and true team , There are no teams as good as you ! You will smash Green , also the Red Team , And the White Team you 'll batter , too . They 'd better scurry before your fury , And in a hurry , without a clue ; Because the Blue Team 's a tried and true team , And there 's no team as good as you ! " " Hmmm . " " And you will win , too . I know you will , " said Katharine . " You going to be at the Mainland ? " The Mainland was a camp for wives and children , and women employees whose development was n't yet complete , across the water from the Meadows , the island where the men went . " That 's as close as I can get to the real thing , " said Katharine wistfully . " That 's close enough , believe me . Tell me , is Bud Calhoun going to be there ? " She colored , and he was instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know , " she said , " but that was before  --  " She shrugged unhappily . " And you know what the Manual says . " " The machines ca n't stand him any more , " said Paul heavily . " Why do n't they build in a gimmick that will give a man a free drink before he gets the ax ? Do you know what he 's up to now ? "  | " I have n't talked to him or seen him , but I did call up Matheson 's office to find out what was going to be done with him . They said he was going to be a project supervisor for the  --  " her voice caught  --  " for the Reeks and Wrecks . " Emotion was giving her a rough going-over now , and she left Paul 's office hurriedly . " I 'm sure he 'll do well , " Paul called after her . " I 'll bet we wo n't know our city a year from now , with him thinking up things for the Reeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she relayed the information to Paul that Doctor Edward Finnerty was at the gate , wanting in . " Bind his hands and feet , put a bag over his head , and have four men bring him up . Fixed bayonets , of course . And be sure and get a picture of it for Shepherd . " Ten minutes later , Finnerty was escorted into Paul 's office by an armed guard . " For heaven 's sake  --  look at you ! " said Paul . Finnerty 's hair was cut and combed , his face was pink , shining , and shaved , and his seersucker suit , while worn and a poor fit , was crisp and sanitary-looking . Finnerty looked at him blankly , as though he could n't guess what the fuss was about . " I 'd like to borrow your car " " Promise to wipe off the fingerprints when you 're through ? " " Oh  --  you 're sore about that pistol business , I suppose . Sorry . I meant to throw it in the river . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure  --  and about how Shepherd turned in a report on you , too , telling how you let me in the plant without an escort . Tough . " Finnerty , after less than a week in Homestead , had taken on rough , swashbuckling mannerisms  --  glaringly synthetic . He also seemed to be getting a real kick out of being a liability as an associate for anyone respectable . Paul was amazed , as he had been amazed at Kroner 's , by how much others knew about his affairs . " How do you know so much ? " " You 'd be surprised who knows what , and how they find out . Surprise the pants off you to know what goes on in this world . My eyes are just opening . " He leaned forward earnestly . " And , Paul  --  I 'm finding myself . At last I 'm finding myself . "  | " What do you look like , Ed ? " " Those dumb bastards across the river  --  they 're my kind of people . They 're real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were real , and so found himself without any sort of comment or emotional response for Finnerty 's important announcement . " Well , I 'm glad you 've found yourself after all these years , " he said . Finnerty had been finding himself ever since Paul had known him . And , weeks later , he 'd always deserted that self with angry cries of impostor , and discovered another . " That 's swell , Ed . " " Well , anyway , how about the keys to the car ? " Is it fair to ask what for ? " " This is a milk run . I want to pick up my clothes and stuff at your house and run them over to Lasher 's . " " You 're living with Lasher ? " Finnerty nodded . " Surprising how well we hit it off , right from the first . " His tone implied the barest trace of contempt for Paul 's shallow way of life . " Keys ? " Paul threw them to him . " How do you plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " With the people . That 's my place . " " You know the cops are after you for not registering ? " " Spice of life . " " You can be jailed , you know . " " You 're afraid to live , Paul . That 's what 's the matter with you . You know about Thoreau and Emerson ? " " A little . About as much as you did before Lasher primed you , I 'll bet . " " Anyway , Thoreau was in jail because he would n't pay a tax to support the Mexican War . He did n't believe in the war . And Emerson came to jail to see him . Henry , ' he said , why are you here ? ' And Thoreau said , Ralph , why are n't you here ? ' " " I should want to go to jail ? " said Paul , trying to get some sort of message for himself out of the anecdote . " You should n't let fear of jail keep you from doing what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Paul reflected that the big trouble , really , / was finding something to believe in.  | " All right , so it does n't . " There was weary disbelief in Finnerty'svoice . He was apparently getting bored with his convention-riddenformer friend from the north side of the river . " Thanks for the car . " " Any time . " Paul was relieved when the door closed behind the new  --  this week 's  --  Finnerty . Katharine opened the door again . " He scares me , " she said . " You need n't be scared . He wastes all his energy on games with himself . There goes your phone . " " It 's Doctor Kroner , " said Katharine . " Yes , " she said into the telephone , " Doctor Proteus is in . " " Would you please put him on , " said Kroner 's secretary . " Doctor Proteus speaking . " " Doctor Proteus is on , " said Katharine . " Just a moment . Doctor Kroner wishes to speak with him . Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Hello , Paul . " " How do you do , sir . " " Paul , about this Finnerty and Lasher business  --  " His playfullyconspiratorial tone implied that the proposed prosecution of these two was sort of a practical joke . " Just wanted to tell you that I called Washington about it , to let them in on what we 're going to do , and they say we should hold off for a while . They say the whole thing ought to be well planned at the top level . It 's apparently bigger stuff than I thought . " His voice dropped to a whisper . " It 's beginning to look like a problem nationwise , not just Iliumwise . " Paul was pleased that there was to be a delay , but the reason for it was a surprise . " How could Finnerty get to be a problem nationwise or even Iliumwise ? He 's only been here a few days . " " Idle hands do the Devil 's work , Paul . He 's probably been getting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're really after . Anyway , the top brass wants in on whatever we do , and they want to have a meeting about it at the Meadows . Let 's see  --  sixteen days from now . " " Fine , " said Paul , and added , in his mind , the imaginary seal he affixed to all official business these days  --  " And to hell with you . " He had no intention of turning informer on anyone . He would simply stall until he and Anita were fully preparedp125to say , " To hell with you , to hell with everything , " aloud . " We think the world of you over here , Paul . " " Thank you , sir . " Kroner was silent for a moment . Suddenly he shouted into the phone , almost rupturing Paul 's eardrum . " Beg your pardon , sir ? " The message had been so loud as to be all pain and no sense . Kroner chuckled , and lowered his voice a little . " I said , who 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Meadows , the Meadows ! Who 's going to win ? " " Oh  --  the Meadows , " said Paul . It was a nightmarish conversation , with Kroner vehement and happy , and with Paul devoid of the vaguest notion as to what was being discussed . " What team ? " said Kroner , a shade peevishly . " Oh . Oh ! The Blue Team is going to win ! " He filled his lungs . " Blue ! " he shouted . " You bet your life we 're going to win ! " Kroner shouted back . " The Blues are behind you , Cap'n ! " Kroner , then , was on the Blue Team , too . He started to sing in his rumbling basso : " Oh you Blue Team , you tried and true team , There are no teams as good as you ! You will smash Green , also the Red Team , And the White Team you 'll batt  --  " The song was interrupted by a cry : " White 's going to win ! Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the background . " So you think Blue 's going to win , do you , do you , eh ? Win ? Think Blue 's going to win , eh , eh ? The White Team will trim you , trim you  --  aha , aha  --  trim the daylights out of the Blue Team . " There was the sound of laughter and banter and scuffling , and Kroner picked up the Blue Team 's song where he 'd left off : " They 'd better scurry before your fury , And in a hurry , without a clue ; Because the  --  " Baer 's piercing voice cut through Kroner 's bass with the126 PLAYER PIANOp126White Team 's song , to the tune of " Tramp , Tramp , Tramp " : " White , White , White 's the one to watch for . Blue , Green , Red will come to grief . Before the fury of the WhiteThey 'll get knocked clear out of  --  " The scuffling grew louder , and the songs degenerated into panting laughter . There was a clatter in Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the dial tone . Paul restored the receiver to its cradle with a limp hand . There was no quitting before the Meadows , he told himself glumly  --  no re-educating Anita and quitting in the few days remaining . The Meadows would have to be endured , and , worse luck , he would have to endure it as captain of the Blue Team . His glance passed over the hairy tan chest , frank gray eyes , and keg-sized biceps of the man on the book jacket , and his thoughts slid easily , gratefully , into the fantasy of the new , good life ahead of him . Somewhere , outside of society , there was a place for a man  --  a man and wife  --  to live heartily and blamelessly , naturally , by hands and wits . Paul studied his long , soft hands . Their only callus was on the large finger of his right hand . There , stained a dirty orange by cigarette tars , a tough hump had grown over the years , protecting his finger against the attrition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of the heroes in the novels had , skills . To date , Paul 's hands had learned to do little save grip a pen , pencil , toothbrush , hair brush , razor , knife , fork , spoon , cup , glass , faucet , doorknob , switch , handkerchief , towel , zipper , button , snap , bar of soap , book , comb , wife , or steering wheel . He recalled his college days , and was sure he 'd learned some sort of manual skill there . He 'd learned to make mechanical drawings . That was when the lump on his finger had begun to grow . What else ? He 'd learned to bounce a ball off several walls with skill , and to the consternation of most of his squash opponents . He 'd been good enough to make the quarter-finals of the Regional Collegiate Squash Tournament two years in a row . He used to be able to do that with his hands . PLAYER PIANO 127p127What else ? Again uneasiness crept up on him  --  the fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along anywhere outside the system , to get along at all contentedly . He might go into some small business , such as the one he claimed to be in when he did n't want to be recognized  --  wholesale groceries . But he would still be caught in the mesh of the economy and its concomitant hierarchy . The machines would n't let him into that business , anyway , and even if they would , there 'd be no less nonsense and posturing . Moreover , despite the fact that Paul was saying to hell with the whole system , he was aware that the relatively unskilled and dull business of buying and selling was beneath him . So to hell with it . The only thing worse would be complete idleness , which Paul could afford , but which , he was sure , was as amoral as what he was quitting . Farming  --  now there was a magic word . Like so many words with a little magic from the past still clinging to them , the word " farming " was a reminder of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how tough a thing a human being could be if he had to . The word had little meaning in the present . There were no longer farmers , but only agriculturalengineers . In the rich Iroquois Valley in Ilium County , thousands of settlers had once made their living from the soil . Now Doctor Ormand van Curler managed the farming of the whole county with a hundred men and several millions dollars ' worth of machinery . Farming . Paul 's pulse quickened , and he daydreamed of living a century before  --  living in one of the many farmhouses now crumbling into their foundations over the valley . He chose one farmhouse in particular for his fantasy , one close to the edge of town that he 'd often admired . He suddenly realized that the farm , the little patch of the past , was n't a part of van Curler 's farm system . He was almost sure it was n't . " Katharine , " he called excitedly , " get me the Ilium Real Estate Manager on the phone . " " Ilium Real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech was effeminate , lisping . " Doctor Pond , this is Doctor Proteus at the Works . " " Well ! What can I do for you , Doctor Proteus ? "  | " You know that farmhouse out on King Street , just outside the city limits ? " " Mmmm . Just a moment . " Paul heard a machine shuffling through cards , and then a bell announced that the card had been found . " Yes , the Gottwald place . I have the card right here . " " What 's being done with it ? " " A good question ! What can be done with it ? I wish I knew . It was a hobby with Gottwald , you know , keeping it just like an old-fashioned farm . When he died , the heirs wanted to get van Curler to take it over , but he said it was n't worth botheringwith . Two hundred acres is all , and he 'd have to cut down the windbreaks to connect it with other fields so he could farm it efficiently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold it to the Farm System anyway . It 's in the deed that the place has to be kept old-fashioned . " He laughed bitterly . " So all old Gottwald left his heirs was a nice headache , a white elephant . " " How much ? " " Are you serious ? The thing 's a museum exhibit , Doctor . I mean , almost nothing mechanical on the place . Even if you could beat the restrictions in the deed , it 'd cost you thousands to get it in shape . " " How much ? " The farm was looking better and better . " Eighteen thousand , it says on the card . " Before Paul could close the deal that instant , Pond added , " but you can get it for fifteen , I 'm sure . How would twelve suit you ? " " Would five hundred hold it until I can look it over ? " " It 's been holding itself for almost fourteen years . Go on out and have a look , if you really feel you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some really nice things I 'd like to show you . " The machine riffled through its cards again . " For instance , there 's a nice Georgian house on Griffin Boulevard . Electronic door openers , thermostatically controlled windows , radar range , electrostatic dust precipitators , ultrasonic clothes washer built in , forty-inch television screens in the master bedroom , guest room , living room , kitchen , and rumpus rooms , and twenty-inch screens in the maids ' rooms and the kiddies ' rooms , and  --  "  | " Where can I get the key to the farm ? " " Oh , that thing . Well , to give you an idea of what you 're getting into , there is no lock . There 's a latchstring . " " Latchstring ? " " Yes , latchstring . I had to go out myself to find out what the darn thing is . There 's a latch on the inside of the door , with a string tied to it . When you want to let somebody just walk in , you stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the string dangles outside . If you do n't want people walking in , you pull the string in through the hole . Ghastly ? " " I 'll survive somehow . Is the latchstring out ? " " There 's a caretaker there , detailed from the Reeks and Wrecks . I 'll call him and tell him to put it out . Confidentially , I 'm sure they 'll take eight . " THE LATCHSTRING AT the Gottwald house was out for Doctor Paul Proteus . He tugged at it , listened with satisfaction as the latch disengageditself inside , and walked in . The living room was dimly lit through tiny-paned , dusty windows , and what light did get in died without reflection on dull , dark antique surfaces . The floor rose and fell like a springboard beneath Paul 's feet . " The house breathes with you , like good underwear , " said a lisping voice from the shadows . Paul looked in the direction from which it had come . The man sucked on his cigarette , lighting his moon face with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " " I 'm Doctor Pond . Would you like me to turn on the lights ? " " Please , Doctor . " " Well , there are n't any . Kerosene lanterns throughout . Want to wash your hands or something ? " " Well , not  --  " " Because , if you do , there 's a pump in the back yard , and an outhouse by the chicken coop . Would you like to see the termites , the dry rot , the hog pen , and the manure-spreader , ip130or shall we go to see that Georgian on Griffin Boulevard ? " He walked to where they could see each other . Doctor Pond was very young , fat , and earnest , and plainly distressed by his surroundings . " You 're certainly eager to sell me the place , " said Paul , laughing . With each new inconvenience , the place became more irresistible . It was a completely isolated backwater , cut off from the boiling rapids of history , society , and the economy . Timeless . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully . " An administrator without a certain awareness , above and beyond the Manual , is like a ship without a rudder . " " He is ? " said Paul absently . He was peering through a back window into the barnyard , and beyond that , through an opened barn door , where he could see the firm buff flank of a cow . " Yes , " said Doctor Pond , " like a ship without a rudder . For example , while the Manual does n't tell me to do it , I make very sure that every man gets a house suited to his station on the ladder of life . The way a man lives can destroy or increase the stature of his job  --  can increase or decrease the . stability and prestige of the entire system . " " You say I can get this whole farm for eight ? " " Please , Doctor  --  you put me in an uncomfortable position . I was excited when you first called , because this place has been such a headache for so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , well , I simply ca n't let you do it . " " I 'll take it . Do the animals go with it ? " " Everything goes with it . That 's in Gottwald 's will and in the deed . It has to be kept just as it is and it must be farmed . See how impossible it is ? Now , shall we go to Griffin Boulevard , where there 's just the right house for the Manager of the Ilium Works ? " When he spoke the title , his voice sounded like a choir of French horns . " I want this . " " If you try to force me to sell it , I 'll quit . " Doctor Pond reddened . " My classification number may be twice what yours is , but I have a certain amount of integrity . " The word , coming from Pond , struck Paul as ridiculous at first , and he started to smile about it . Then he saw how tensep131the man was , and realized that what Pond was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipsqueak of a man in a pipsqueak job had pipsqueak standards he was willing to lay his pipsqueak life down for . And Paul had a vision of civilization as a vast and faulty dike , with thousands of men like Doctor Pond in a rank stretching to the horizon , each man grimly stopping a leak with his finger . " This would be a hobby , of course  --  a plaything , " Paul lied . " I 'd go on living where I 'm living now . " Doctor Pond sighed and sank into a chair . " Oh  --  thank the Lord ! Oh ! You have no idea how much better I feel . " He laughed in nervous relief . " Of course , of course , of course . And you 'd keep Mr. Haycox on ? " " Who is Mr. Haycox ? " " The Reek and Wreck who 's assigned to keep the place going . He 's under orders from the Reeks and Wrecks , but of course the Gottwald estate pays him . You 'd have to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He 's an antique too . " He threw his hands over his head . " What a place . I think you 're mad , simply mad . But he who pays the piper calls the tune . " " As long as he does n't threaten to disgrace the system . " " Exactly ! That 's almost good enough to carve over your mantel , but I doubt if the deed will let you . " " How about , After us the deluge . ' " said Paul . " Hmm ? " Doctor Pond tried to make sense of the quotation , seemingly decided that it was some archaic , pleasant sentimentfor those who understood poetry , and smiled . " That 's nice too . " Apparently the word " deluge " stuck in his mind . " Now , about the cellar here : it has an earth floor and is damp . " He leaned out of the back door , wrinkled his nose in the sweet , stringent odor of manure cooking in the sunlight , and shouted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul had opened the back of a grandfather clock . " I 'll be damned , " he said under his breath . " Wooden works . " He checked his own watch , the shock-proof , waterproof , antimagnetic , glow-in-the-dark , self-winding chronometer Anita had given him for Christmas , and found that the grandfather clockp132was off by about twelve minutes . Indulging an atavistic whim , he set his watch to correspond with the hands of the relic , which grated and creaked away the seconds , sounding like a wooden ship straining in a strong wind . The house was certainly one of the oldest in the valley . The rough rafters were inches above Paul 's head , and the fireplace was sooted black , and there was n't a true right angle anywhere . The house seemed to have twisted and stretched on its foundationsuntil it had found a position of comfort for all of its parts  --  like a sleeping dog . More remarkable than the way the house had relieved its stresses was the way it conformed to Paul 's particular , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he could work with his hands , getting life from nature without being disturbed by any human beings other than his wife . Not only that , but Anita , with her love for things colonial , would be enchanted , stunned , even , by this completely authentic microcosm of the past . " Ah , " said Doctor Pond , " Mr. Haycox at last . When you yell for him , he never yells back . Just starts coming , taking his own sweet time . " Paul watched Mr. Haycox 's heavy-footed progress across the hard-packed earth of the barnyard . The caretaker was an old man , with close-cropped white hair , coarse , tanned skin , and , like Rudy Hertz , with remarkably big hands . Unlike Rudy , Mr. Haycox was n't desiccated . His flesh was firm , hard , and well colored . The chief toll he seemed to have paid time was in teeth , of which he had few . He might have been part of a pageant recalling farm life as it had once been . He wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy , crusty work shoes . As though to point up the anachronism of Mr. Haycox and the Gottwald place for Paul , one of Doctor Ormand van Curler'smen , riding on a tractor , appeared on the other side of the windbreak , snappy in spotless white coveralls , a red baseballcap , cool sandals which almost never touched the ground , and white gloves which , like Paul 's hands , rarely touched anything but steering wheels , levers , and switches . " What do you want ? " said Mr. Haycox . " What 's the matterp133now ? " His voice was strong . He had none of the sheepishness or obsequiousness Paul had seen so frequently in Reeks and Wrecks . Mr. Haycox bore himself as though he owned the place , wanted the talk to be as brief and pithy as possible , and doubted that whatever was wanted of hit I could possibly be more important than what he had been doing . " Doctor Proteus  --  this is Mr. Haycox . " " How are you ? " said Paul . " ' Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor ? " " Doctor of Science , " said Paul . Mr. Haycox seemed annoyed and disappointed . " Do n't call that kind a doctor at all . Three kinds of doctors : dentists , vets , and physicians . You one of those ? " " No . Sorry . " " Then you ai n't a doctor . " " He is a doctor , " said Doctor Pond earnestly . " He knows how to keep machines healthy . " He was trying to build up the importance of graduate degrees in the mind of this clod . " Mechanic , " said Mr. Haycox . " Well , " said Doctor Pond , " you can go to college and learn to be a specialist in all sorts of things besides making people or animals well . I mean , after all . The modern world would grind to a halt if there were n't men with enough advanced training to keep the complicated parts of civilization working smoothly . " " Um , " said Mr. Haycox apathetically . " What do you keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I spent seven years in the Cornell Graduate School of Realty to qualify for a Doctor of Realty degree and get this job . " " Call yourself a doctor , too , do you ? " said Mr. Haycox . " I think I can say without fear of contradiction that I earned that degree , " said Doctor Pond coolly . " My thesis was the third longest in any field in the country that year  --  eight hundred and ninety-six pages , double-spaced , with narrow mar-gins . " " Real-estate salesman , " said Mr. Haycox . He looked back and forth between Paul and Doctor Pond , waiting for them to say something worth his attention . When they 'd failed to rally after twenty seconds , he turned to go . " I 'm doctor ofp134cowshit , pigshit , and chickenshit , " he said . " When you doctors figure out what you want , you 'll find me out in the barn shovelingmy thesis . " " Mr. Haycox ! " said Doctor Pond , furious . " You 'll stay here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you was . " He stopped , and stood perfectly motionless . " Doctor Proteus is buying the farm . " " My farm ? " Mr. Haycox turned slowly to face them , and real concern was in his eyes . " The farm you 've been taking care of , " said Doctor Pond . " My farm . " " The Gottwald estate 's farm , " said Doctor Pond . " That a man ? " " You know it is n't . " " Well , I 'm a man . As far as men go , this here is my farm more'n it 's anybody else 's . I 'm the only man who ever cared about it , ever did anything about it . " He turned earnestly to Paul . " You know the will says you got to keep it just like it is ? " " I plan to . " " And keep me on , " said Mr. Haycox . " Well , I do n't know for sure , " said Paul . This was a complicationhe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was the point of the undertaking . " That is n't in the will , " said Doctor Pond , pleased to have found something that shocked respect into Mr. Haycox . " All the same , you got to keep me on , " said Mr. Haycox . " This is what I do . " He gestured at the yard and buildings , all neat . " This is what I 've done . " " Gottwald bought this place from Mr. Haycox 's father , " Doctor Pond explained . " There was some sort of informal agreement , I think , that Mr. Haycox could have the job of caretaker for his lifetime . " " Informal , hell ! " said Mr. Haycox . " He promised , Gottwalddid . This here 's been our family 's for more'n a hundred years  --  lots more . And I 'm the last of the line , and Gottwald promised , by God , he promised it 'd be the same as mine till it came time for me to go . "  | " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dead  --  Gottwald meant when I was dead . I got twice as many years behind me as you do , sonny boy , and twice as many ahead of me . " He moved closer to Doctor Pond , and squinted at him . " I 've moved so many big piles of shit in my life , figure I could throw a little dab like you clean over the barn . " Doctor Pond 's eyes widened , and he backed away . " We 'll see about that , " he said faintly . " Look , " said Paul hastily , " I 'm sure we can work this out . Soon as I close the deal , Mr. Haycox , you 'll be working for me . " Things going to be just like they were ? " " My wife and I 'll be coming out from time to time . " Now did n't seem to be the time to tell him or anyone that he and Anita would be permanent residents . Haycox did n't care for this much . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice . " He nodded grimly . Then , unexpectedly and charmingly , Mr. Haycox smiled . " Wonder if I went and offended that there Doctor of Realty ? " Pond had fled . " Well , I 'll be getting back to work . Long as this here is going to be your farm , you might 's well fix the pump . Needs a new packing . " " Afraid I do n't know how , " said Paul . " Maybe , " said Mr. Haycox walking away , " maybe if you 'd of gone to college another ten or twenty years , somebody would of gotten around to showing you how , Doctor . " ANITA SEEMINGLY MISTOOK Paul 's quiet excitement for daydreams of happy hours to come at the Meadows , which were less than two weeks away . She did n't know that he was learning to be a farmer andlaying the groundwork for teaching her to be a farmer 's wife . It was a hot Saturday , and on the pretext of buying himself a fielder 's mitt , Paul went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There Mr. Haycox condescendingly and impa/tiently imparted half-truths about running the place , and gave Paul a vague confidence that he could get the hang of it after a while . That evening at suppertime , Paul , satisfyingly pooped after having trailed Mr. Haycox for hours , asked his wife if she knew what day the coming Wednesday was . She looked up from a list of things she was to pack for her trip to the Mainland and , more important , for Paul 's trip to the Meadows . " Ca n't imagine . Have you got nice-looking tennis shoes for the trip ? " " They 'll do . For your information , next Wednesday is  --  " " Shepherd is taking twelve pairs of socks  --  all green . He 's a captain , too , you know . " " I know . " " What do you make of that ? It 's kind of a surprise : the first time you get to be captain , he does too . " " Maybe he sent a coupon to the Rosicrucians . How on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's taking ? " " Well , he has n't got a wife to help him plan , so he came over this afternoon to get my help . So I made a list of things he ought to take . Men are so helpless . " " They muddle through . Did he have anything interesting to say ? " She laid down the list and looked at him reproachfully . " Only about the police report about your pistol , and another one about the underworld people you were with that awful night in Homestead . " She wadded her napkin and threw it down petulantly . " Paul  --  why do n't you tell me these things ? Why do I always have to find out from someone else ? " " Underworld ! " snorted Paul . " Oh , for heaven 's sake . " " Shepherd says Lasher and Finnerty are being watched as potential saboteurs . " " Everybody 's being watched ! Why do you listen to that old woman of a man ! " " Why do n't you tell me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trivial . Because I was afraid you would n't see them that way and get all upset  --  the way you 're getting upset . It 's all fixed . Kroner fixed it . "  | " Shepherd said you could get ten years for the pistol businessalone . " " Next time he 's over , ask him if he has any idea how much time I 'd get if I mashed up his long nose for him . " Paul 's muscles were tight from the unaccustomed rigors of the afternoon , and animal smells had communicated to him a feel of primitive strength . The notion of pushing Shepherd 's face in -- a bizarre sport in a lifetime of pacifistic notions  --  came as an unexpected complement to the day . " Well , to hell with the captain of the Green Team , I say . Again I 'll ask , what day is the coming Wednesday ? " " I 'm sure I do n't know . " " Our engagement anniversary . " It was an anniversary with disquieting connotations for both of them  --  an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage . It was the date on which Anita had announced to Paul that she was with child , his child , and on which he had responded by offering her his name , etc . Now , with the event softened by years of more or less adequate marriage , Paul thought that they might sentimentally make it something that it was not . The anniversary , more to the point , fell at an ideal time for the beginning of his re-education program for Anita . " And I have a special evening planned , " he said ; " not like any evening we 've ever had together , darling . " " Funny , I 'd forgotten the date completely . Really ? Next Wednesday ? " She gave him an odd , rebuking smile , as though the story of their engagement had got twisted in her mind  --  as though she thought he had brought about the event by a now insignificant deception . " Well that 's sweet , " she said . " Kind of cute of you to remember . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a methodical nature that , when something of . importance was in the offing , other aspects of life could have no importance at all . To her it seemed almost indecent to give attention to anything but the crucial matter of the Meadows . " To hell with the Meadows . " " You do n't mean that . "  | " I mean we 're still going out next Wednesday . " " Well , I hope you know what you 're doing . You 're the captain . " " I 'm the captain . " EDGAR R. B. HAGSTROHM , thirty-seven , R &R-131313,; Undercoater First Class , 22nd Surface Preserving Battalion , 58th Maintenance Regiment , ' loth Building and Grounds Division , Reconstruction and Reclamation Corps , had been named after his father 's favorite author , the creator of Tarzan  --  Tarzan , who , far away from the soot and biting winter of the Hagstrohms ' home town , Chicago , made friends with lions and elephants and apes , and swung through trees on vines , and was built like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he wanted of civilization 's beautiful women in tree houses , and left the rest of civilization alone . E. R. B. Hagstrohm liked Tarzan as much as his father had , and hated being a little man and being in Chicago ten times as much . And Edgar was reading about Tarzan in the bedroom when his fat wife , Wanda , called to him from her station before the picture window in the front room of their prefabricated home in Proteus Park , Chicago , a postwar development of three thousand dream houses for three thousand families with presumably identical dreams . " Gosh , here he comes , Edgar ! " " All right , all right , all right , " said Edgar . " So he 's coming ! So what am I supposed to do , holler bloody murder , kiss his feet , and faint ? " He took his time about getting off the bed , and he did n't smooth out the dent he 'd made in the bedding . He laid his book open on the bedside table , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started for the living room . " What 's he look like , Wan ? " " You got ta see , Ed  --  like a Chinese bird cage or something , all gold and fancy . " The Shah of Bratpuhr had asked his guide , Doctor Ewingp139J . Halyard , if he might see the home of a typical Takaru , freely translated , from one culture to another , as " average man . " The request had been made as they were passing through Chicago from Carlsbad Caverns , and Halyard had stopped off at the local personnel office for the name of a representative American in the neighborhood . The personnel machines had considered the problem and ejected the card of Edgar R. B. Hagstrohm , who was statisticallyaverage in every respect save for the number of his initials : his age ( 36 ) , his height ( 5 ' 7 " ) , his weight ( 148 lbs. ) , his years of marriage ( II ) , his I.Q. ( 83 ) , the number of his children ( 2 : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of his bedrooms ( 2 ) , his car ( 3 yr. old Chev. 2 dr. sed. ) , his education ( h.s. grad , 117th in class of 233 ; maj. in business practice ; 2nd string f'ball , b'k'tb'l ; soc. comm. , sen'r play ; no coll. ) his vocation ( R &R),; his avocations ( spec'r sports , TV , softb'l , f'sh'g ) , and his war record ( 5 yrs. , 3 ov'sea ; T-4 radioman ; 157th Inf . Div. ; battle stars : Hjoring , Elbesan , Kabul , Kaifen , Ust Kyakhta ; wounded 4 times ; P'ple H't , 3 CI. ; Silv . Star ; Br'ze Star , 2 cl. ; G 'd Cond . Med . ) . And the machines could have made an educated guess that , since Hagstrohm had gone that far in being average , he had probably been arrested once , had had sexual experience with five girls before marrying Wanda ( only moderately satisfying ) , and had had two extramarital adventures since ( one fleeting and foolish , the other rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the age of 76.2 of a heart attack . What the machines could n't guess was that Edgar 's second extramarital affair , the deep one , was with a widow named Marion Frascati , that it was still going on , and that Marion 's deceased husband had been Lou Frascati , a second-coater first class , Edgar 's best friend . To their own profound shock , Edgar and Marion had found themselves in each other 's arms a scant month after good old Lou 's death . And again , and again , and again  --  and they 'd tried to bring it to an end , honest-to-God they had . But it was like a bright , fat cherry on the gray mush of their lives . And they thought , wistfully , weakly , that maybe it would n't really matter as long as no one was hurt  --  the kids , sweet , loyal Wanda . And that Lou would n't have wanted any/thing more , now that he had another variety of bliss , than that good old Edgar and good old Marion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their flesh . But they had n't believed it . And the kids noticed something screwy was going on , and Wanda 'd cried a couple of times lately and refused to tell him why , and probably Lou , wherever he was . . . . Anyway , Edgar was going to go on seeing Marion , but he was going to tell Wanda , God bless her and God help her  --  tell her , and  --  Who was banging on the Hagstrohmdoor but the goddam Shah of Bratpuhr , for Chrissakes . " Come in , come in , " said Edgar , and he added under his breath , " your majesty , your highness , emperor of the universe and all the ships at sea , you nosy son-of-a-bitch . " When Halyard had phoned him about the visit , Hagstrohm had made a point of not being impressed by the Shah 's title , or by Halyard 's rank . It was rarely that he got the opportunity to show what he thought of rank  --  that a man was a man for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as he would if the callers had been fellow Reeks and Wrecks . Wanda had taken a different view , and had started frantically to clean the place from top to bottom , and to make lemonade and send Edgar , Jr. , out for little cookies , but big Edgar had put a stop to all that . He put the kids out , and that was the only cleaning up that was to be done . The door opened , and in came the Shah , followed by Khashdrahr , Halyard , and Doctor Ned Dodge , the manager of ProteusPark . " Aha ! " said the Shah , gingerly touching the enameled steel wall of the living room . " Mmmmm . " Edgar held out his hand , and the parade brushed past it , heedless . " Well , kiss mine , " he muttered . " Eh ? " said Doctor Dodge . " You heard me . " " You 're not in a saloon now , Hagstrohm , " whispered Dodge . " Watch yourself ; this is international relations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " What 's eating you , anyway ? "  | " The guy walks into my house and wo n't even shake my hand . " " It 's not the custom in his country . " " Is it in yours ? " Dodge turned his back and grinned hospitably at the Shah . " Two bedrooms , living room with dining alcove , bath , and kitchen , " he said . " This is the M-17 house . Radiant heating in the floor . The furniture was designed after an exhaustive national survey of furniture likes and dislikes . The house , the furniture , and the lot are sold as a package . Simplified planningand production all the way round . " " Lakki-ti , Takaru ? " piped the Shah , looking at Edgar closely for the first time . " What 's he say ? " " He wants to know if you like it here , " said Khashdrahr . " Sure  --  I guess . It 's all right . I suppose . Yeah . " " It 's nice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow me into the kitchen , " said Doctor Dodge , leaving Wanda and Edgar behind , " you 'll see the radar range . Cooks by high frequency , and cooks the inside of whatever'sbeing cooked as fast as the outside . Cooks anything in a matter of seconds , with perfect control . Make bread without a crust , if you want to . " " What is the matter with crust on bread ? " asked Khashdrahrpolitely . " And this is the ultrasonic dishwasher and clotheswasher , " said Dodge . " High-frequency sound passing through the water strips dirt and grease off anything in a matter of seconds . Dip in , take out , bingo ! " " And then what does the woman do ? " asked Khashdrahr . " Then she puts the clothes or dishes in this drier , which dries them out in a matter of seconds , and  --  here 's a nifty trick , I think  --  gives the clothes a spanking-clean outdoors odor , like they were dried in the sun , see , with this little ozone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Khashdrahr . " She feeds the clothes through this ironer , which can do what was an hour 's ironing before the war in three minutes . Bing ! "  | " And then what does she do ? " asked Khashdrahr . " And then she 's done . " " And then what ? " Doctor Dodge reddened perceptibly . " Is this a joke ? " " No , " said Khashdrahr . " The Shah would like to know what it is that the woman Takaru  --  " " What 's a Takaru ? " said Wanda suspiciously . " Citizen , " said Halyard . " Yes , " said Khashdrahr , smiling at her oddly , " citizen . The Shah would like to know why she has to do everything so quickly  --  this in a matter of seconds , that in a matter of seconds . What is it she is in such a hurry to get at ? What is it she has to do , that she must n't waste any time on these things ? " " Live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get a little fun out of life . " He laughed , and clapped Khashdrahr on the back , as though to jar him into feeling some of the jollity in this average American man 's home . The effect on Khashdrahr and the Shah was a poor one . " I see , " said the interpreter coldly . He turned to Wanda . " And how is it you live and get so much fun out of life ? " Wanda blushed and looked down at the floor , and worried the carpet edge with her toe . " Oh , television , " she murmured . " Watch that a lot , do n't we , Ed ? And I spend a lot of time with the kids , little Delores and young Edgar , Jr . You know . Things . " " Where are the children now ? " asked Khashdrahr . " Over at the neighbors ' place , the Glocks , watching television , I expect . " " Would you like to see the ultrasonic washer work ? " said Doctor Dodge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg , lipstick , bloodstains  --  " " The transducer 's shot again , " said Edgar , " so the washer 's out of commission . Wanda 's been doing the washing in a tub for a month now , waiting for a new transducer . " " Oh , I do n't mind , " said Wanda . " Really , I like doin ' ' em that way . It 's kind of a relief . A body needs a change . I do n't mind . Gives me something to do . " Halyard ended the silence that followed her statement with a brisk suggestion that they leave these good people alone andp143have a look at the central recreation pavilion down the street . " If we hurry , " said Doctor Dodge , " we 'll probably catch the leathercraft class still in session . " The Shah patted the radar stove , the laundry console , and peered for a moment at the television screen , which showed five persons seated around a conference table , arguing earnestly . , Halyard was explaining that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular deductions from Edgar 's R &RC; pay check , along with premiums on his combinationhealth , life , and old age security insurance , and that the furnishings and equipment were replaced from time to time with newer models as Edgar  --  or the payroll machines , rather  --  completed payments on the old ones . " He has a complete security package , " said Halyard . " His standard of living is constantly rising , and he and the country at large are protectedfrom the old economic ups and clown by the orderly , predictable consumer habits the payroll machines give him . Used to be he 'd buy on impulse , illogically , and industry would go nutty trying to figure out what he was going to buy next . Why , I remember when I was a little boy , we had a crazy neighbor who blew all his money on an electric organ , while he still had an old-fashioned icebox and kerosene stove in his kitchen ! " Edgar closed the door and leaned against it , against the door of his M-17 castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked nice , I think , " she said . She said it whenever a visitor  --  Amy Glock , Gladys Pelrine , the Shah of Bratpuhr , anybody  --  left . " Yep , " said Edgar . And he felt evil and damned as he looked at Wanda , good , good soul , who 'd never done anything to offend him , whose love for him was as big as all outdoors . He fingered the three ten-dollar bills in his pocket , his takehomepay  --  cigarette money , recreation money , small luxury money the machines let him have . This tiny atom of the economy under his control he was going to spend , not on himself or Wanda or the kids , but on Marion . Edgar 's troubled heart had gone out to the crazy man in Halyard 's story , thep144guy who 'd bought himself an electric organ . Expensive , impractical , strictly personal  --  above and beyond the goddamned package . But deceit was another thing . " Wanda , " said Edgar , " I 'm no good . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was n't in the least surprised . " Yes , you are , Edgar , " she said lamely . " You 're a fine man . I understand . " " About Marion ? " " Yes . She 's very beautiful and charming . And I 'm not exactly a girl any more , and I expect I 'm pretty dull . " She started to cry , and , good soul that she was , she tried to keep him from seeing it . She hurried into the kitchen , took four suppers from the deep freeze , and thrust them into the radar range . " Call the children , will you please , Edgar ? " she said in a small , high voice . " Supper will be ready in twenty-eight seconds . " Edgar shouted the children 's names into the twilight , and returned to Wanda . " Listen , Wan  --  it is n't you . The Lord knows it is n't your fault . " He hggged her from behind , and she twisted away and pretended to adjust dials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done . Clockwork was doing everything . Chimes rang , the clockwork clicked , and the range 's hummingstopped . " Call the children before everything gets cold , " she said . " They 're coming . " Edgar tried to hug her again , and she let him this time . " Listen , " he said passionately , " it 's the world , Wan  --  me and the world . I 'm no good to anybody , not in this world . Nothing but a Reek and Wreck , and that 's all my kids 'll be , and a guy 's got to have kicks or he does n't want to live  --  and the only kicks left for a dumb bastard like me are the bad ones . I 'm no good , Wan , no good ! " " It 's me that 's no good to anybody , " said Wanda wearily . " Nobody needs me . You or even little old Delores could run the house and all , it 's so easy . And now I 'm too fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got fat , and my grandmother got fat , and guess it 's in the blood ; but somebodyneeded them , they were still some good . But you do n't need me , Ed , and you ca n't help it if you do n't love me anyp145more . Just the way men are , and you ca n't help it if you 're the way God made you . " She looked at him lovingly , pityingly . " Poor man . " Delores and Edgar , Jr. , bustled in , and Edgar and Wanda composed themselves and told their children all about the Shah . The subject was soon exhausted , and at dinner only the children spoke and touched their food . " Somebody sick ? " said Edgar , Jr . " Your mother is n't well . She has a headache , " said Edgar . " Yeah ? That 's too bad , Mom . " " Just a little thing , " said Wanda . " It 'll pass . " " How about you , Pop ? " said Edgar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball game at the pavilion tonight ? " Edgar kept his eyes on his plate . " Like to , " he mumbled . " Promised Joe I 'd go bowling with him tonight . " " Joe Prince ? " " Yeah , Joe Prince . " " Why , Daddy , " said Delores , " we saw Mr. Prince over to the Glocks ' , and he said he was going to the basketball game . " " He did not ! " said Edgar , Jr. , fiercely . " Just be quiet . You do n't know what you 're talking about . He did n't say that at all . " " He did , too ! " said Delores stubbornly . " He said  --  " " Delores , honey , " said Wanda , " I 'm sure you misunderstoodMr . Prince . " " Yes , " said Edgar , Jr. , " I remember now he said he was going bowling with Pop . Sis got it all wrong , Mom . " His hands were trembling , and , clumsily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his father jumped to their feet to catch it before it toppled all the way . Young Edgar caught it , and when his eyes met old Edgar 's they were full of hate . " Guess I 'm too tired to go to the ball game after all , " he said . " Guess I 'll stay home and watch television with Mom . " " Do n't miss any good times on my account , " said Wanda . " I get along just fine by myself . " There was a series of sharp taps on the picture window , and the Hagstrohms looked up to see the Shah of Bratpuhr rattling his ringed fingers against the glass . He had just re/turned from the pavilion to the limousine , which had been left in front of the Hagstrohm 's M-17 home . " Brahouna ! " cried the Shah cheerfully . He waved . " Brahouna , Takaru . " " ' Live ! ' " translated Krashdrahr . WHEN WEDNESDAY CAME , Paul stopped by his farm early in the morning and gave Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't a parlor maid . Reluctantly , Paul gave Mr. Haycox to understand that he could do the job or clear out , and that the job had better be well done . It was that important to Paul that everything be perfect for the delicate transformation of Anita . " You think you can just go around buying anybody to do anything you damn please , " said Mr. Haycox . " Well , you 're mistaken this time , Doctor . You can take your doctor 's degree , and  --  " " I do n't want to fire you . " " Then do n't ! " " For the last time , as a favor to me  --  " " Why did n't you say so in the first place ? " " Say what ? " " As a favor . ' " " All right ; as a favor  --  " " As a favor , just this once , " said Mr. Haycox . " I 'm no parlor maid , but I try to be a good friend . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention it . " During the day , Anita called Paul to ask what she was to wear . " Old clothes . " " A barn dance ? " " Not quite , but close . Dress as though it were . " " Paul , with the Meadows so close and all , do you think we should be going out and tearing around ? "  | " The Meadows is n't a funeral . " " It could be , Paul . " " Just for tonight , let 's forget the Meadows . Tonight it 's going to be just Paul and Anita , and to hell with everybody else . " " That 's very easy to say , Paul . It 's a sweet idea and everything , but  --  " " But what ? " he asked irritably . " Well , I do n't know ; I do n't want to nag , but it does seem to me that you 're being awfully slap-happy about the Meadows , about the Blue Team . " " What should I be doing ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , should n't you be getting lots of sleep and eating the right foods and jogging around a little after work ? And cutting down on cigarettes , maybe ? " " What ? " " You 've got to be in shape if the Blue Team 's going to win . " Paul laughed . " Now listen , Paul , you need n't laugh . Shepherd says he 's seen careers made and broken by how men made out as team captains at the Meadows . Shepherd 's given up smoking- com-pletely . " " You can tell him I 've taken up hashish to speed up my reaction time . His fast ball will look like a toy balloon blowing over home plate . We are going out tonight . " " All right , " she said gloomily . " All right . " " I love you , Anita . " I love you , Paul . " And she was ready when he got home , not as Ilium 's Lady of the Manor but as a trim , kittenish girl in denim trousers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shirts , with its tails knotted below her breasts , white sneakers , and a red bandana about her neck . " Is this right ? " " Perfect . " " Paul  --  I do n't understand what 's going on . I called up the Country Club , and they do n't know about any barn dance . And neither do the clubs in Albany , Troy , or Schenectady. "  |p148Anita  , Paul knew , hated surprises , could n't bear not to be on top of every situation . " This is a private one , " said Paul . " Just for the two of us . You 'll see when the time comes . " " I want to know now . " " Where are our anniversary martinis ? " The table where the pitcher and glasses awaited him every night was bare . " You 're on the wagon until after the Meadows . " " Do n't be ridiculous ! Everybody is going to be drinking for two weeks up there . " " Not the captains . Shepherd says they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much he knows . The drinks are on the house . " Paul mixed martinis , drank more than his usual ration , and changed into a suit of stiff , crackling denim overalls he 'd bought in Homestead that afternoon . He was sorry to see that Anita was getting no pleasure from the suspense he 'd built up . Instead of happy anticipation , she showed signs of suspicion . " Ready ? " he said brightly . " Yes  --  I suppose . " They walked in silence to the garage . With a grand gesture , Paul held the car door open . " Oh , Paul , not the old car . " " There 's a reason . " " There could n't be a reason good enough to get me in that thing . " " Please , Anita  --  you 'll see soon enough why we 've got to take this one . " She got in and sat on the edge of the seat , trying to come in contact with the car as little as possible . " Honestly ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the long grade by the golf course , however , she unbent a trifle . In the beams of the headlightswas a pale and hairy man in green shorts , green socks , and a green shirt with the word " Captain " written across it . The man was jogging along the shoulder of the road , now and then breaking his pace to pirouette and shadowbox , then pickingup his jogging again . Paul blasted Shepherd with his automobile horn , and wasp149delighted to see him bound across the ditch to get out of his way . Anita rolled down her window and cheered . The captain of the Green Team waved , his face twisted by exertion . Paul pressed the throttle to the floor , laying down a cloud of burned oil and carbon monoxide . " That man 's got a lot of get up and go , " said Anita . " He fills me full of lie down and die , " said Paul . They were passing the battlements of the Ilium Works now , and one of the guards , recognizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine gun in friendly fashion . Anita , who had been getting more and more restless , made as though to grab the wheel . " Paul ! Where are you going ? Are you crazy ? " He brushed her hand away , smiled , and kept on going across the bridge into Homestead . The bridge was blocked again by Reeks and Wrecks who were painting yellow lines to mark traffic lanes . Paul looked at his watch . They had ten more minutes until time for , as the expression went , knocking off work . Paul wondered if Bud Calhoun had thought up this project . Like most of the R &R; projects , it was , to Paul at least , ironic . The four-lane bridge had , before the war , been jammed with the cars of workers going to and from the Ilium Works . Four lanes had been nothing like enough , and a driver stayed within his lane or got the side of his car ground off . Now , at any time of day , a driver could swerve from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance in ten thousand of hitting another vehicle . Paul came to a stop . Three men were painting , twelve were directing traffic , and another twelve were resting . Slowly , they opened a lane . " Hey , Mac , your headlamp 's busted . " " Thanks , " said Paul . Anita slid across the seat to get close to him , and he saw that she was scared stiff . " Paul  --  this is awful . Take me home . " Paul smiled patiently and drove into Homestead . The hydrantin front of the saloon by the end of the bridge was goingp150again , and he had to park down the block . The same dirty boy was making paper boats for the amusement of the crowd . Leaning against a building and smoking nervously was a seedy old man who looked familiar to Paul . Then Paul realized that the man was Luke Lubbock , the indefatigable joiner , who was lost in the limbo of mufti , waiting for the next parade or meetingto start . With mixed emotions he looked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Very probably they were in the saloon 's dark , rearmost booth , agreeing on everything . " Paul  --  is this your idea of a joke ? Take me home , please . " " Nobody 's going to hurt you . These people are just your fellow Americans . " " Just because they were born in the same part of the world as I was , that does n't mean I have to come down here and wallow with them . " Paul had expected this reaction , and remained patient in the face of it . Of all the people on the north side of the river , Anita was the only one whose contempt for those in Homestead was laced with active hatred . She was also the only wife on the north side who had never been to college at all . The usual attitude of the Country Club set toward Homesteaders was contempt , all right , but it had an affectionate and amused undertone , the same sort of sentiment felt by most for creatures of the woods and fields . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be extremely cruel to her , the cruelest thing he could do , he knew , would be to point out to her why she hated as she did : if he had n't married her , this was where she 'd be , what she 'd be . " We 're not getting out , " said Paul . " We 'll just sit here a few minutes and watch . Then we 'll move on . " " Watch what ? " " Whatever there is to see . The line painters , the man runningthe hydrant , the people watching him , the little boy makingboats , the old men in the saloon . Just keep looking around . There 's plenty to see . " She did n't look around , but slouched down in the seat and stared at her hands . Paul had an idea what she was thinking  --  that for some rea/son she could n't understand , he was doing this to humiliate her , to recall her humble origins . Had that been what he wanted to do , he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd fallen silent and tried to make herself small . " You know why I brought you here ? " Her voice was a whisper . " No . But I want to go home , Paul . Please ? " " Anita  --  I brought us here because I think it 's high time we got a completely new perspective , not on just our relationship to ourselves , but on our relationship to society as a whole . " He did n't like the sound of the words as they came out , sententious and inflated . Their impact on Anita was nothing . He tried again : " In order to get what we 've got , Anita , we have , in effect , traded these people out of what was the most important thing on earth to them  --  the feeling of being needed and useful , the foundation of self-respect . " That was n't much good either . He was n't getting through to Anita yet . She still seemed certain that she was somehow being punished by him . He tried once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got , and then see what these people have got , I feel like a horse 's ass . " A glimmering of understanding crossed Anita 's face . Guardedly , she cheered up a little . " Then you 're not mad at me ? " " Lord , no . Why should I be mad at you ? " " I do n't know . I thought maybe you thought I nagged too much  --  or maybe you thought something was going on between Shepherd and me . " This last  --  this suggestion that he would ever worry about Shepherd  --  threw Paul completely off the orderly course of reeducatingAnita . The notion that he might be jealous of the captain of the Green Team was so ludicrous , showed so poor an understanding , that it commanded his full attention . " I 'll be jealous of Shepherd when you 're jealous of Katharine Finch , " he laughed . This , to his surprise , Anita chose to take seriously . " You do n't mean that ! " " Mean what ? "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That dumpy little  --  " " Wait a minute ! " The conversation was really afield now . " I just meant there was about as much chance of there being something between Katharine and me as there was of there being something between you and Shepherd . " She was still on the defensive , and apparently had n't grasped the negative sense of his parallel . She came back at him aggressively . " Well , Shepherd is certainly a more attractive man than Katharine is a woman . " " I 'm not arguing that , " said Paul desperately . " I do n't want to argue that at all . There is n't anything between Katharine and me , and there is n't anything between you and Shepherd . I was simply pointing out how absurd it would be for either one of us to suspect the other . " " You do n't think I 'm attractive ? " " I think you 're devastatingly attractive . You know that . " His voice had gotten loud , and as he glanced out at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would-be observers , were being observed . A paper boat shot the rapids to the storm sewer unnoticed . " I did n't bring us here to accuse each other of adultery , " he whispered hoarsely . " Then why did you ? " " I told you : so we could both get the feel of the world as a whole , not just our side of the river . So we could see what our way of life has done to the lives of others . " Anita was on top of the situation now , having successfully attacked and confused Paul , and having found that she was n't being baited or punished . " They all look perfectly well fed to me . " " But they 've had the spiritual stuffing knocked out of them by people like my father , like Kroner and Baer and Shepherd , like us . " " They could n't have been too well stuffed in the first place , or they would n't be here . " Paul was mad , and the delicate mechanism that kept him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for the grace of God , go you ! " " Paul ! " She burst into tears . " That 's not fair , " she saidp153brokenly . " Not at all fair . I do n't know why you had to say that . " " It is n't fair for you to cry . " " You 're cruel , that 's what you are  --  just plain cruel . If you wanted to hurt me , congratulate yourself . You certainly did . " She blew her nose . " I must have had something these people do n't , or you would n't have married me . " " Oligomenorrhea , " he said . She blinked . " What 's that ? " " Oligomenorrhea  --  that 's what you had that these others do n't . Means delayed menstrual period . " " How on earth did you ever learn a word like that ? " " I looked it up a month after we were married , and it etched itself on the inside of my skull . " " Oh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite enough , " she said bitterly . " If you wo n't drive me home , I 'll walk . " Paul started the car , abused the gears with savage satisfaction , and drove back across the bridge , toward the north side of the river . When they 'd reached the mid-point of the bridge , he was still warmed and excited by the sudden fight with Anita . By the time they were under the guns of the Ilium Works , rationalityand remorse were setting in . The fight had been a complete surprise . Never had they gone at it so poisonously . More surprising , Paul had been the vicious one , and Anita had been little more than a victim . Confusedly he tried to remember the events that had led up to the fight . His memory was no help . And how completely fruitless and destructive the fight had been ! In the heat of a bad instant he had said what he knew would hurt her most , would , by extension , make her hate him most . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't . And here he was with his cheery and careful plans for starting a new life with her shot to hell . They were passing the golf course now . In minutes they 'd be home . " Anita  --  " By way of an answer , she turned on the car radio and im/patiently twiddled the dials , waiting for the volume to come up , presumably to drown him out . The radio had n't worked for years . " Anita  --  listen . I love you more than anybody on earth . Good God but I 'm sorry about what we said to each other . " " I did n't say anything to you like what you said to me . " " I could cut my tongue out for having said those things . " " Do n't use any of our good kitchen knives . " " It was a freak . " " So am I , apparently . You passed our driveway . " " I meant to . I have a surprise for you . Then you 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid fight was . " " I 've had quite enough surprises tonight , thank you . Turn around , please . I 'm worn out . " " This surprise cost eight thousand , Anita . Still want to turn around ? " " Think I can be bought , do you ? " she said angrily , but her expression was softening , answering her own question . " What on earth could it be ? Really ? Eight thousand dollars ? " Paul relaxed , settling back in his seat to enjoy the ride . " You do n't belong in Homestead , sweetheart . " " Oh , hell  --  maybe I do . " " No , no . You 've got something the tests and machines will never be able to measure : you 're artistic . That 's one of the tragedies of our times , that no machine has ever been built that can recognize that quality , appreciate it , foster it , sympathize with it . " " It is , " said Anita sadly . " It is , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I love you , Paul . " " Look ! A deer ! " Paul flicked on his bright lights to illuminatethe animal , and recognized the captain of the Green Team , still jogging , but now in an advanced state of exhaustion . Shepherd 's legs flailed about weakly and disjointedly , and his feet struck the pavement with loud , limp slaps . There was no recognition in his eyes this time , and he floundered on heedlessly . " With every step he hammers another nail into my coffin , "  |p155said  Paul , lighting a fresh cigarette from the one he had just finished . Ten minutes later he stopped the car , went around to Anita 's side , and affectionately offered his arm . " The latchstring is out , darling , for a whole new and happier life for the two of us . " " What does that mean ? " " You 'll see . " He led her to the front door of the low little house through a dark , fragrant tunnel roofed and walled by lilacs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pull . " She tugged gingerly . The latch inside clattered free , and the door swung open . " Oh ! Ohhhh  --  Paul ! " " Ours . This belongs to Paul and Anita . " She walked in slowly , her head back , her nostrils wide . " I feel like crying , it 's so darling . " Hastily , Paul checked the preparations for the tricky hours ahead , and was delighted . Mr. Haycox , probably in an orgy of masochism , had scrubbed every surface . Gone were the soot and dust , leaving only the clean , soft , glowing patina of age over everything  --  the pewter on the mantel , the cherry case of the grandfather clock , the black ironware on the hearth , the walnut stock and silver inlays of the long rifle on the wall , the tin potbellies of the kerosene lamps , the warm , worn maple of the chairs . . . . And on a table in the center of the room , looking archaic , too , in the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle of gin , a bottle of vermouth , and a bucket of ice . And beside these were two glasses of whole , fresh milk from the farm , fresh hard-boiled eggs from the farm , fresh peas from the farm , and fresh fried chicken from the farm . As Paul mixed the drinks , Anita went about the room sighinghappily , touching everything lovingly . " Is it really ours ? " " As of yesterday . I signed the final papers . Do you really feel at home here ? " She dropped into a chair before the fireplace and took the glass he handed her . " Ca n't you tell ? Do n't I radiate how I feel ? " She laughed quietly . " He wants to know if I like it . It 's priceless , you brilliant darling , and you got it for eight thousand dollars ! Are n't , you smart ! " " Happy anniversary , Anita . "  | " I want a stronger word than happy . " " Ecstatic anniversary , Anita . " " Ecstatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord , how I love you ! " " I love you . " He had never loved her so much . " Do you realize , darling , that that grandfather clock alone is worth almost a thousand dollars ? " Paul felt terribly clever . It was fantastic how well things were turning out . Anita 's contentment with the place was genuine , and the process of weaning her from one house to another , from one way of life to another , seemed , in a miraculousfew minutes , to have been almost completed . " This is your kind of surroundings , is n't it . " " You know it is . " " Did you know the clock had wooden works ? Think of it ? Every part whittled out of wood . " " Do n't worry about it . That 's easily remedied . " " Hmm ? " " We can get an electric movement put in . " " But the whole charm  --  " She was in a transport of creativity now , and did n't hear him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrostatic dust precipitator would fit right in the lower part of the case . " " Oh . " " And you know where I 'd put it ? " He looked around the room and saw no spot for it other than where it was . " That niche there seems ideal . " " In the front hall ! Ca n't you just see it there ? " " There is no front hall , " he said in puzzlement . The front door opened right into the living room . " Our front hall , silly . " " But , Anita  --  " " And that spice cabinet on the wall  --  would n't it be darling with some of the drawers sticking out , and with philodendron growing from them ? I know just the spot in the guest room . " " Swell . " " And these priceless rafters , Paul ! This means we can have rough-hewn beams in our living room , too . Not just in thep157kitchen , but the living room too ! And I 'll eat your classification card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I was looking forward to eating it myself , " said Paul quietly . " And these wide-board floors : you can imagine what they 'll do for the rumpus room . " " What did the rumpus room ever do for me ? " said Paul grimly . " What did you say ? " " I said , what did the rumpus room ever do for me ? " " Oh . I see . " She laughed perfunctorily and , her eyes bright , she searched for more plunder . " Anita  --  " " Yes ? Oh ! What a delightful Cape Cod lighter . " " Listen to me for just a minute . " " Certainly , darling . " " I bought this place for us to live in . " " You mean just the way it is ? " " Exactly . It ca n't be changed . " " You mean we ca n't take any of these things out ? " " No . But we can move ourselves in . " " This is another one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm having such a good time . " " I 'm not teasing ! This is the life I want . This is where I want to live it . " " It 's so dark , I ca n't see by your face whether you 're serious or not . Turn on the lights . " " No lights . " " No electricity ? " " Only what 's in your hair . " " How do they run the furnace ? " " No furnace . " " And the stove ? " " Firewood . And the refrigerator is a cold spring . " " How perfectly hideous ! " " I 'm serious , Anita . I want us to live here . " " We 'd die in six months . " " The Haycox family lived here for generations . "  | " You are playful tonight , are n't you ? Just so straight-faced and everything , keeping your joke alive . Come here and kiss me , you sweet clown . " " We 're going to spend the night here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Will you give it a try , anyway ? " " And I 'll be a good old fat farm Mama , and get breakfast on the wood stove  --  coffee , home-grown eggs and cream , homebakedbiscuits drowned in homemade butter and jam . " " Would you ? " " I 'd drown in butter and jam first . " " You could learn to love this life . " " I could n't , and you know it . " His temper was rising again , in response to bitter disappointment , as it had done an hour before in Homestead . And again he was looking for something short of a slap in her face that would shock humility into her . The sentence that came out had been ready for a long time . He spoke it now , not because now was the right time , but because it packed a punch . " It does n't matter what you think , " he said evenly . " I 've made up my mind to quit my job and live here . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded her arms across her chest , as though fighting a chill , and rocked in silence for a few moments . " I thought maybe that was coming , " she said at last . " I thought maybe that was what you were up to . I 'd hoped it was n't , Paul . I 'd prayed it was n't . But  --  well , here we are , and you 've said it . " She lit a cigarette , smoked it in shallow , tasteless puffs , and blew the smoke through her nose . " Shepherd said you would . " " He said I was about to quit ? " " No . He said you were a quitter . " She sighed heavily . " He knows you better than I do , apparently . " " God knows it 'd be easy enough to stick with the system , and keep going right on up . It 's getting out that takes nerve . " " But why quit , if it 's so easy to stick with it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why I took you there , so you 'd get the feel of things . " " That silly business about Katharine Finch and Shepherd ? " " No , no  --  God no . About how people like us have taken all the self-respect from all the others . "  | " You said you felt like a horse 's ass . I remember that . " " Do n't you , sometimes ? " " What an idea ! " " Your conscience , dammit  --  does n't it ever bother you ? " " Why should it ? I 've never done anything dishonest . " " Let me put it another way : do you agree things are a mess ? " " Between us ? " " Everywhere ! The world ! " She could be appallingly nearsighted . Whenever possible , she liked to reduce any generalizationto terms of herself and persons she knew intimately . " Homestead , for instance . " " What else could we possibly give the people that they have n't got ? " " There ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else I could we give them , as though everything in the world were Y ours to give or withhold . " " Somebody 's got to take responsibility , and that 's just the way it is when somebody does . " " That 's just it : things have n't always been that way . It 's new , and it 's people like us who 've brought it about . Hell , everybody used to have some personal skill or willingness to work or something he could trade for what he wanted . Now that the machines have taken over , it 's quite somebody who has anything to offer . All most people can do is hope to be given something . " " If someone has brains , " said Anita firmly , " he can still get to the top . That 's the American way , Paul , and it has n't changed . " She looked at him appraisingly . " Brains and nerve , Paul . " " And blinders . " The punch was gone from his voice , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drink , from scrambling over a series of emotional peaks and pits , from utter frustration . Anita caught the strap of his overalls and pulled him down to kiss him . Paul yielded stiffly . " Ohhhhhhh , " she chided , " you 're such a little boy sometimes . " She pulled him down again , this time making sure he kissed her on the lips . " You stop worrying , now , you hear ? " she whispered in his ear.  | " Descent into the Maelstrom , " he thought wearily , and closed his eyes , and gave himself over to the one sequence of events that had never failed to provide a beginning , a middle , and a satisfactory end . " I love you , Paul , " she murmured . " I do n't want my little boy to worry . You 're not going to quit , sweetheart . You 're just awfully tired . " " Mmmm . " " Promise not to think any more about it ? " " Mmmm . " " And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mmmm . " " And what team is going to win at the Meadows ? " " Mmmm . " " Paul  --  " " Hmmm ? " " What team is going to win ? " " Blue , " he whispered sleepily . " Blue , by God , Blue . " " That 's my boy . Your father would be awfully proud . " Yup . He carried her across the wide-board floor into the pinewainscotedbedroom and laid her down on a patchwork quilt on a bird's-eye maple bed . There , Mr. Haycox had told him , six independent people had died , and fourteen had been born . DOCTOR PAUL PROTEUS , for want of a blow severe enough to knock him off the course dictated by the circumstances of his birth and training , arrived uneventfully at the day when it was time for men whose development was not yet complete to go to the Meadows . The crisis was coming , he knew , when he would have to quit or turn informer , but its approach was unreal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced a false tranquillity on himself  --  a vague notion that everything would come out all right in the end , the way it always had for him.  |p161The  big passenger plane , after an hour in the air , circled over the shore , where the pine forest met the waters at the source of the St. Lawrence . The plane dropped lower , and the landing strip in the forest could be seen , and then the cluster of log lodges and dining hall and shuffleboard courts and tennis courts and badminton courts and softball diamonds and swings and slides and bingo pavilion of the Mainland , the camp for women and children . And jutting into the river was a long dock and three white yachts , the port of embarkation for men going to the island called the Meadows . " I guess this is just about goodbye , " said Paul to Anita , as the plane came to a stop . " You look wonderful , " said Anita , straightening his blue captain 's shirt for him . " And what team is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gott mit uns . " " Now , I 'm going to be working on Mom here , while  --  " " Ladies over here ! " boomed the public address system . " Men will assemble over on the dock . Leave your luggage where it is . It will be in your cabins when you arrive . " " Goodbye , darling , " said Anita . " Goodbye , Anita . " " I love you , Paul . " " I love you , Anita . " " Come on , " said Shepherd , who had arrived on the same plane . " Let 's get going . I 'm anxious to see just how hot this Blue Team is . " " Blue Team , eh ? " said Baer . " Worried about the Blue Team , are you , eh ? Eh ? White . White 's the one to look out for , boy . " He stretched out his white shirt for them to admire . " See ? See ? That 's the shirt to look out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Doctor Kroner ? " said Shepherd . " Went up yesterday , " said Paul . " He 's among the official greeters , so he 's already on the island . " He waved once more to Anita , who was going down a gravel path toward the Mainland'sbuildings with a dozen other women , Katharine Finch and Mom Kroner among them , and a handful of children . All day , planes would be bringing more . Anita sidled up to Mom and took her fat arm . Concealed loudspeakers in the virgin forest burst into song : 16a PLAYER PIANO " To you , beautiful lady , I raise my eyes ; My heart , beautiful lady , to your heart sighs . Come , come , beautiful lady , to Paradise ... " The song died in a clatter in the loudspeaker , a cough , and then a command : " Men with classification numbers from zero to one hundred will please board the Queen of the Meadows ; those with numbers from one hundred to two hundred and fifty will board the Meadow Lark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Spirit of the Meadows . " Paul , Shepherd , Baer , and the rest of the contingent from the **29;6182;TOOLONG area walked out onto the dock where earlier arrivals were waiting . All put on dark glasses , which they would wear during the next two weeks to protect their eyes from the unrelenting glare of the summer sun on the river , and on the whitewashed buildings , white gravel paths , white beach , and white cement courts of the Meadows . " Green 's going to win ! " shouted Shepherd . " You tell ' em , Cap ! " Everyone shouted and sang , the marine engines burbled and roared , and the three yachts shot toward the island in V-formation . Squinting through spray , Paul watched the Meadows come closer and closer , hot , bleached , and sanitary . The white serpentstretching the island 's length could now be seen as a row of white cubes , the insulated cement-block structures called , in Meadows parlance dating back to more primitive facilities , tents . The amphitheater on the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sports area around it was a geometric patchwork of every imaginable kind of court . Whitewashed rocks everywhere framed the paths and gar The air quaked with a sharp , painful crash . And another . Another . " Blain ! " Rockets from the island were exploding overhead . In another minute the three yachts were rumbling and fuming into their slips , and the band was playing " The Star-Spangled Banner . " " And the rockets red glare , The bombs bursting in air .. . "  |p163The  bandmaster held up his baton , and the bandsmen paused significantly . Vuuuuzzzzzzip ! " went a rocket . " Kablooooom ! " " Gave proof through the night , That our flag was still there ... " After the anthem came a cheery kaleidoscope of " Pack Up Your Troubles , " " I Want a Girl , " " Take Me Out to the Ball Game , " " Working on the Railroad . " The new arrivals scrambled over the decks to catch the hands extended from the wharf by a rank of older men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These were the Grand Old Men  --  the district managers , the regional managers , the associate vice-presidents and assistant vice-presidents and vice-presidents of the Eastern and Middle-Western divisions . " Welcome aboard ! " was the greeting , and always had been . " Welcome aboard ! " Paul saw that Kroner was reserving his big hand and welcomefor him , and he picked his way across the deck until he reached the hand , took it , and stepped to the wharf . " Good to have you aboard , Paul . " " Thank you , sir . It 's good to be aboard . " A number of the other older men paused in their greetings to look in friendly fashion at the bright young son of their departed wartime leader . " Report to the Ad Building for registration , then check into your tents to make sure your luggage is there , " said the public address system . " Get to know your tentmate , then lunch . " With the band leading them , the new arrivals swung along the gravel walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a banner declaring : " The Blue Team Welcomes You to the Meadows . " There were cries of good-natured outrage , and human pyramidswere built in a twinkling , with the top men clawing down the infuriating message . A young member of the Blue Team slapped Paul on the back . " What an idea , Cap'n ! " he crowed . " Boy , that really showed ' em who 's got the wide-awake outfit . And we 'll go on showing these guys , too . "  | " Yep , " said Paul , " you bet . That 's the spirit . " Apparently this was the youngster 's first visit to the Meadows . In this state of nature he did n't know that the banner was the work of a special committee whose sole mission was to stir up team rivalry . There would be more such goads at every turn . Inside the door was a green placard : " Abandon All Hope , Ye Who Do n't Wear Green Shirts ! " Shepherd whooped delightedly , brandished the placard overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor by a wave of Blues , Whites , and Reds . " No rough-housing indoors ! " said the loudspeaker sharply . " You know the rules . No roughhousing indoors . Save your ginger for the playing field . After registration , report to your tents , get to know your buddies , and be back for lunch in fifteen minutes . " Paul arrived at his tent ahead of his as yet unknown buddy . The two of them , according to the foreword in the Song Book , would develop a sort of common-law brotherhood as a result of their having shared so much beauty , excitement , and deep emotion together . The chill of the air-conditioned room made him feel dizzy . Coming out of this flicker of vertigo , Paul 's eyes focused on a dinner-plate sized badge on the pillow of his bunk . " Dr. Paul Proteus , Wks . Mgr. , Ilium , N. Y. , " it said . And , below this , " Call Me Paul or Pay Me $5 . " The second part of the legend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be called by his first name at the Meadows was the Old Man himself , the successor of Paul 's father , Doctor Francis Eldgrin Gelhorne . He , National Industrial , Commercial , Communications , Foodstuffs , and Resources Director , was damn well DoctorGelhorne , sir , at any hour of the night or day , and anywhere he went . And then Paul saw the badge on his buddy 's pillow : " Dr. Frederick Garth , Wks . Mgr. , Buffalo , N. Y. Call Me Fred or Pay Me $5 . " Paul sat down on the edge of his bed and struggled against the uneasy perplexity the sight of Garth 's badge had precipitated . He had known many men , Shepherd for instance , who were forever seeing omens and worrying about them  --  omensp165in a superior 's handshake , in the misspelling of a name in an official document , in the seating arrangement of a banquet table , in a superior 's asking for or offering a cigarette , in the tone of . . . Paul 's career , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , and he 'd found omen analysis dull , profitless . For him the omens were all good  --  or had been until now . Now , he , too , was growing aware of possibly malevolent spooks , revealing themselves in oblique ways . Was it chance or ignorance or some subtle plot that had put him in the same cell with Garth , the other candidate for Pittsburgh ? And why had Shepherd been made a captain , when the honor was reserved for those who were going high and far indeed ? And why . . . . Manfully , Paul turned his thoughts into other channels , superficially , at least , and managed to laugh like a man who did n't give a damn about the system any more . His buddy walked in , gray at the temples , tired , pale , and kind . Fred Garth wanted desperately to be liked by everyone , and had achieved a sort of social limbo , affecting no one very much one way or the other . He had risen because of this quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again two powerful personalities , backed by impressive factions , had aspired for the same job . And the top brass , fearing a split if they chose one faction 's man over the other , had named Garth as an inoffensive compromise candidate . There was a feeling , general enough not to be branded sour grapes , that Garth was all but over his head in the big assignments compromise politics had handed him . Now , though he was only in his early fifties , he seemed terribly old  --  willing , good-hearted , but apologetically weak , used up . " Doctor Proteus ! I mean Paul . " Garth shook his head , laughed as though he 'd done a comical thing , and offered a five-dollar bill to Paul . " Forget it , Doctor Garth , " said Paul , and handed it back to him . " I mean Fred . How are you ? " " Fine , fine . Ca n't complain . How 's the wife and children ? " " All fine , fine , thanks . " Garth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " About what ? " " I mean , that was silly of me , asking about your children when you have n't got any . "  | " Silly of me not to have any . " " Maybe , maybe . It 's a trial , though , watching your kids grow up , wondering if they 've got what it takes , seeing ' em just about killing themselves before the General Classification Tests , then waiting for the grades  --  " The sentence ended in a sigh . " I 've just gone through that GCT business with my oldest , Brud , and I 've got to live through the whole nightmare twice more still , with Alice and little Ewing . " " How 'd Brud make out ? " " Hmmm ? Oh  --  how 'd he make out ? His heart 's in the right place . He wants to do well , and he boned up harder for the tests than any kid in the neighborhood . He does the best he can . " " Oh  --  I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack at the tests  --  different ones , of course . He was under the weather when he took them the first time  --  tail end of some virus business . He did n't miss by much , and the Appeal Board made a special ruling . He gets his second chance tomorrow , and we 'll have the grades around suppertime . " " He 'll make it this time , " said Paul . Garth shook his head . " You 'd think they 'd give a kid something for trying , would n't you ? God , you ought a see the little guy plugging away . " " Nice day , " said Paul , changing the distressing subject . Garth looked out of the window abstractedly . " It is , is n't it . God smiles on the Meadows . " " Probably did before we occupied it . " " I did n't make that up . " " Make what up ? " " About God smiling . That 's from Doctor Gelhorne , of course . Remember ? He said that last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Gelhorne said so many memorable things , it was hard for a person to stow them all away in his treasure house of souvenirs . " Lunch ! " said the loudspeakers . " Lunch ! Remember the rule : get to know somebody new at each meal . Have your buddy on one side , but a stranger on the other . Lunch ! Lunch ! " Irrelevantly , the speakers blared " Oh How I Hate to Get Up in thep167Morning . " Paul and Garth and five hundred other pairs walked across the parade ground to the dining hall . As the crowd bore Paul and his buddy through the swinging screen doors , Kroner caught his arm and drew him to one side . Garth , like the good buddy he wanted to be , stepped out of line and waited . " Tomorrow night , " said Kroner . " The big meeting is tomorrow night  --  after the keynote play and bonfire . " " Fine . " " I told you the Old Man himself is coming . It 's going to be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't quite know what 's up , but I 've a hunch it 's going to be the biggest thing in your career . " " Gosh . " " Do n't worry . With the blood you 've got in your veins , you 've got more than what it 'll take to do the job  --  whatever it is . " " Thanks . " Paul got back in line with Garth . " He certainly likes you , does n't he ? " said Garth . " Old friend of my father 's . Said it was good to have me aboard . " " Oh . " Garth looked a little embarrassed . Paul 's bald lie had pointed up for the first time their competitive situation . He let the lie pass . Shepherd would have hounded Paul , and , more subtly , Kroner , until he 'd learned every word that had passed between them . Paul felt real warmth for Garth . " Come on , buddy , let 's find a couple of strangers . " " It 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Paul . " " Look for some apple-cheeked youngster fresh out of school . " " There 's one . " " Berringer ! " said Paul , amazed . When the machines had made a list of Ilium men eligible for the Meadows , Berringer 's card had stayed in its slot . He was the last man in the whole Works who deserved an invitation . Yet , here he was . Berringer seemed to know what was going through Paul 's head , and he returned Paul 's gaze with an insolent smile . Baer stepped between them . " Forgot , forgot  --  supposed to tellp168you , " he said . " Berringer , about Berringer . Kroner said to tell you , and I forgot , forgot . " " How the hell did he get up here ? " " Kroner brought him up . Last minute thing , see ? Hmm ? Kroner thought it 'd break his father 's heart if the boy was n't asked , and after what happened to Checker Charley and all . " " There goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yep  --  there it goes , there it goes , all right . " He shrugged and raised his eyebrows quizzically . " Zip zip , out the window . " Paul reflected that Baer was possibly the most just , reasonable , and candid person he 'd ever known  --  remarkably machinelikein that the only problems he interested himself in were those brought to him , and in that he went to work on all problems with equal energy and interest , insensitive to quality and scale . Paul glanced once more at Berringer , saw his luncheon cornpanionwas Shepherd and that his shirt was green , and forgot about him . He and Garth finally found a pair of very young strangers with two empty seats between them , and sat down . The redheaded youngster next to Paul looked at his badge . " Oh , Doctor Proteus . I 've heard of you . How are you , sir ? " " Paul , not Doctor . Fine , how are you  --  " he studied his cornpanion'sbadge  --  " Doctor Edmund L. Harrison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man next to you , " said the loudspeaker . " Do n't talk to anyone you know . " " Married ? " said Paul . " That 's what you 're here for , to get to know new people , to broaden your horizons , " said the loudspeaker . " Nossir , I 'm en " The more contacts you make here at the Meadows , " said the loudspeaker , " the more smoothly industry will function , co-operationwise . " " I 'm engaged , " said Doctor Harrison . " An Ithaca girl : " " Two seats right over here , gentlemen  --  over in the corner . Right over there . Let 's get our seats quickly , because there'sp169a full program , and everybody wants to get down to knowing everybody else , " said the loudspeaker . " Nossir , " said Doctor Harrison . " Atlanta . " He looked at Paul 's badge again . " Are n't you the son of  --  " " Now that we 're all seated and getting to know one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together ? " said the loudspeaker . " Yes , he was my father , " said Paul . " Turn to page twenty-eight of the Song Book , " said the loudspeaker . " Twenty-eight , twenty-eight ! " " He was quite a man , " said Harrison . " Yes , " said Paul . " Wait Till the Sun Shines , Nellie ! ' " shouted the loudspeaker . " Find it ? Twenty-eight ! All right , now , let 's go ! " The band at the far end of the hall , amplified to the din of an elephant charge , smashed and hewed at the tune as though in a holy war against silence . It was impossible even to be cordial to oneself in the midst of the uproar . Paul 's stomach knotted and his tastebuds went dead , and the delicious , expensivefood went down his gullet like boiled horsemeat and hominy grits . " Paul , Paul , Paul , oh Paul ! " shouted Baer from across the table . " Paul ! " " What ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they 're calling for you ! " " Do n't tell me the captain of the Blue Team is such a coward he ran out at the last minute , " the loudspeaker was saying sarcastically . " Come on ! Where 's that Blue captain ? " Paul stood , and held up his hand . " Here , " he said , in a voice inaudible even to himself . Cheers and boos greeted him , in a proportion of one to three . He was pelted by wadded paper napkins and maraschino cherriesfrom the tops of salads . " Well , " said the loudspeaker tauntingly , " let 's hear your song . " Hands gripped Paul and hoisted him into the air , and he was borne down the aisle toward the bandstand by a flying wedge of blue-shirted men . They dumped him on the bandstand and formed a cordon about him . The master of ceremonies , a fat ,  |p170red  old man with breasts like a woman 's sticking through his wet T-shirt , thrust a Song Book into his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Team . " Oh you Blue Team , you tried and true team , " said Paul . His voice came back at him , strange and frightening , amplified electronically to fierce defiance and determination . " There are no teams as good as you ! " At this point he was completely drowned out by the stampingof feet , whistles , catcalls , and the clank of spoons on glasses . The master of ceremonies , delighted with the high spirits he was evoking , handed Paul a blue banner to wave . No sooner were Paul 's hands on the staff than he saw the ranks of his protectors split wide open . Berringer , his head lowered , his thick legs driving , charged him . In the scuffle , Paul swung at the informality-maddened Berringer , missed , and was knocked , hors de combat , off the bandstandand halfway through the kitchen doors . " Please ! Please ! " the loudspeaker was pleading . " There are very few rules at the Meadows , but the few that there are must be observed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green shirt . There 's to be no rough stuff indoors . Do you understand ? " Laughter was general . " One more outburst like this one , and you 'll be asked to leave the island ! " Kind hands picked up Paul , and he found himself looking into the grave , dull face of Luke Lubbock , the perennial joiner , who wore a busboy 's uniform . One of the cooks , who had been watching with disdain , turned away quickly when Paul looked at him , and disappeared into the big meat locker . As Paul 's teammates carried him back to his seat , he realized fleetingly , as a fragment of a nightmare , that the cook had been Alfy , the master of silent television . " Now , now , " said the loudspeaker . " No more rough stuff , or we 'll have to call off the rest of the fun . Now , where 's the captain of the White Team ? " When the fun was over , Paul and Doctor Harrison of Ithaca walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time until the memorial ser/vice , " said the loudspeaker . " Ten minutes to make new contactsbefore the memorial service . " " Nice meeting you , sir , " said Doctor Harrison . " I enj --  " " My wild Irish rose , " howled the loudspeaker , " the sweetest flow'r that grows  --  " The refrain ended in a clatter . " Your attention , please . The Program Committee has just informed me that we 're running seven minutes behind schedule , so would you please form up at the Oak right away , please . The memorial service will take place right away . " A reverent hush settled like smog over the perspiring crowd that had dispersed over the shuffleboard courts and around the ping-pong tables near the dining hall . Now they began to form about the Oak , the official symbol for the entire national organization . Its image was on every letterhead , and , stitched in a rectangle of white silk , its image snapped in the breeze , just below the American Flag on the parade-ground mast . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes fixed on the lower branches of the magnificent old tree , hands folded before their genitals . " White 's going to win ! " cried a short , thin youngster with big teeth . The older men looked at him with sadness , with melancholy rebuke . Now was not the time for such horseplay . Now was almost the only time that was not the time . The youngster 's outburst of infinite bad taste would poison his next two weeks , and probably his career . He had in an instant become " the boy who yelled at memorial service . " That described him , and nobody would care to investigate him any further . Now , if he turned out to be a spectacular athlete . . . No . His flaccid physique and pale skin indicated that this avenue to forgiveness was closed to him . Paul looked at him sympathetically , and recalled similar bad starts from the past . The man would be terribly lonely , turn to a career of surly drinking , and never be invited again . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the flags , and now and then the clatter of dishes and silverware from the dining hall.  |p172A  harried-looking photographer ran in front of the group , dropped to one knee , fired a flashbulb , and ran away again . " Vuuuuzzzzzip ! " went a rocket . " Kabloooom ! " A parachuted American Flag was flung from the bomb to drift lazily to the river . Kroner detached himself from the crowd and walked soberly to the thick tree trunk . He turned and looked down at his hands thoughtfully . His first words were so soft , so choked with emotion , that few heard them . He inhaled deeply , threw back his shoulders , raised his eyes , and gathered strength to say them again . In the brief moment before Kroner spoke again , Paul looked about himself . His eyes met those of Shepherd and Berringer , and what passed between them was tender and sweet . The crowd had miraculously become a sort of homogenized pudding . It was impossible to tell where one ego left off and the next began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " it is the custom here at the Meadows  --  our custom , our Meadows  --  to meet here under our tree , our symbol of strong roots , trunk , and branches , our symbol of courage , integrity , perseverance , beauty . It is our custom to meet here to remember our departed friends and co-workers . " And now he forgot the crowd , and talked to the fat cumulus clouds scudding over the blue sky . " Since last we met , Doctor Ernest S. Bassett has left our world for his reward in a better one . Ernie , as you all know , was  --  " The photographer ran out , flashed a bulb in Kroner 's face , and disappeared again . " Ernie was manager of the Philadelphia Works for five years , of the Pittsburgh Works for seven . He was my friend ; he was our friend : a great American , a great engineer , a great manager , a great pioneer at the head of the procession of civilization , opening new , undreamed-of doors to better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at less cost . " Now and then brokenly , Kroner told of Ernie Bassett as a young engineer , and he traced his career from works to works . " He gave himself unstintingly engineeringwise , managershipwise , personalitywise , Americanwise , and  --  " Kroner pausedp173to look impressively from face to face . Again he talked to the clouds- " heartwise . " A man stepped from the crowd to hand Kroner a long white box . Kroner opened it slowly and studied it thoughtfully beforeshowing its contents to anyone else . At last he reached in and unfurled a blue and white pennant , the Armed Forces " E " that Bassett had won during the war as manager of the PhiladelphiaWorks . A muted bugle played taps . Kroner knelt at the foot of the tree and placed Ernie Bassett'spennant there . The photographer dashed up , got the picture , and dashed away . " Vuuuuzzzzzip ! Kabloooom ! " A male choir , concealed in the shrubbery , sang ever so softly  --  to the tune of " Love 's Sweet Song " : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toast our living symbol , reaching toward the sky . Grown from but an acorn , Giant now you are ; May you ne'er stop growing ; Rise to the stars ! Proud sy-him-bol a-hov Ourrrrrrrrs . " " A minute of silence in unspoken prayer for departed friends , " said the loudspeaker . All through the minute of silence , Paul was aware of a snuffling in the background . Someone 's dam of reserve had broken under the impact of the ceremony  --  someone who must have been awfully close to Bassett . There were tears standing in many eyes , and here and there teeth were sunk in unstable lips , but nowhere could Paul see the sobber . Suddenly he spotted him , not in the crowd , but in the dining hall . Luke Lubbock , a pile of dirty dishes in his arms , had been completely carried away . Big , honest tears for the manager of the Pittsburgh Works flooded his cheeks . Rather roughly , the headwaiter hustledhim away from the screen door.  | " Vuuuuzzzzzip ! ' Kablooooom ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and Kroner was half led from the tree by other oldsters who had known Bassett well . The crowd dispersed . Paul looked longingly at the doors of the saloon , which was located in a separate white building . He tested the doors to make sure they were really locked , and of course they were . The saloon never opened until the cocktail hour , after the games . " Your attention ! " said the loudspeaker . " Your attention , please . The program for the rest of the day : " In ten minutes the teams will meet at their captains ' tents for assignments to various sports . Formal competition will not begin until tomorrow morning . After assignment , relax , get to know your buddy , do n't hang around with the same old crowd . " Cocktails at five-thirty . Supper at six-thirty . Now  --  attention to this change : the keynote play and bonfire will not take place tonight . Will not . They will take place tomorrow night , and there will be a group sing tonight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captains , team captains  --  will you please report to your tents . " Without much hope , Paul rattled the saloon doors , thinking he might be able to talk a floor sweeper inside into getting him a little something . " I 've just been informed , " said the loudspeaker , " I 've just been informed that the captain of the Blue Team is not in his tent . Doctor Paul Proteus ; Doctor Paul . . . " CHAPTER XXTHE SHAH OF BRATPUHR 'S golden turban hung unfurledlike a roller towel in heaven from the hat rack in Miami Beach . " Puku Pala koko , puke ebo koko , nibo aki koko , " said the Shah . " What 's the foreign gentleman after ? " asked Homer Big-ley , proprietor of the barber shop.  | " He wants a little off the sides , a little off the back , and leave the top alone , " mumbled Khashdrahr Miasma , under a steamingtowel in the barber chair next to the Shah 's . Doctor Ewing J. Halyard was giving himself a ragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while his charges received their first American haircuts . He smiled and nodded at whatever was being said , but heard nothing save the soft crackle of the letter in his breast pocket as he shifted nervouslyin a search for comfort no chair could give him . The letter , from the personnel officer of the State Department , had pursued him from New York to Utica to Niagara Falls to Camp Drum to Indianapolis to St. Louis to Fort Riley to Houston to Hollywood to the Grand Canyon to Carlsbad Cavernsto Hanford to Chicago to Miami Beach , where he roosted long enough for the letter to catch him  --  catch him like a javelin , quivering squarely between the shoulder-blades of his spirit . He was lobster-red from a day on the sand , but beneath this stingingveneer of fine health and spirits he was cold and dead-white with fear . " My dear Mr. Halyard , " it had begun . " My dear Mr .... " While Halyard brooded , Homer Bigley , with the reflexes born of a life of barbering , selected his scissors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though his right hand were servicedby the same nerve as his diaphragm and voicebox , he began to cut hair and talk  --  talked to the uncomprehending Shah after the fashion of an extroverted embalmer chatting with a corpse . " Yessir , picked a nice time to come . They call this the offseason , but I say it 's the nicest time of year . Cheapest time , too . But that is n't what I meant . It 's fifteen degrees cooler right here and now than it is in New York City , and I 'll bet not one person in fifty up north knows that . Just because the fact has n't been promoted . Everything 's promotion . Ever stop to think about that ? Everything you think you think because somebody promoted the ideas . Education  --  nothing but promotion . " Good promotion and bad promotion . Barbers , now , they get a lot of bad promotion on account of cartoons and television comedians , you know ? Ca n't pick up a magazine or turn on the television without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And sure , maybe that 's good for a little snicker , maybe , and God knows the world can use a few snickers , but I do n't think it 's right to hurt somebody to give somebody else a snicker . I mean that it all kind of cancels out , and nobody 's ahead . And I just wonder if any of those comedians or cartoon people ever stop to think about the thousands of barbers who go from one year to the next without they ever cut a customer , and still these people go around telling everybody that barbers are slashingso many arteries and veins you wonder how the sewers can handle it all . But seems like nobody ever thinks about what 's maybe sacred to somebody , any more . " Matter of fact , of course , used to be barbers did bleed people , of course , and got paid for it , too . One of the oldest professions on earth , if you stop to think about it , but nobody does . Used to be sort of doctors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the doctors got sore and took over all that stuff and left the barbers haircutting and shaving . Very interesting history . But my father used to say , before he died , of course , that the barbers would be here long after the last doctor 's laid away , and there was a lot in what he said . He was worth listening to . " Nowadays , by golly , it takes more time and skill to cut hair'n to do what the doctors do . If you had syphilis or the clap or scarlet fever or yellow fever or pneumonia or cancer or something , why , hell , I could cure you while I was drawing the water for a shampoo . Take a little old needle , puncho ! squirto ! miracle ! and give you a clean bill of health along with your change . Any barber could do what a doctor does nowadays . But I 'll give you fifty dollars if you can show me a doctor who can cut hair . " Now , they say barbering is n't a profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big for their breeches since the Middle Ages and look down on barbering . You take medicine , you take the law . Machinery ! " Doctor does n't use his head and education to figure out what 's the matter with you . Machines go over you  --  measure this , measure that . Then he picks out the right miracle stuff , and the only reason he does is on account of the machines tell him that 's what to do . And the lawyers ! Of course , I sayp177it 's a pretty good thing what happened to them , because it was a bad thing for them , which could n't help to be a good thing for everybody else . I did n't say that . My father said it . Those are his words . But the law 's the law now , and not a contestbetween a lot of men paid to grin and lie and yell and finagle for whatever somebody wanted them to grin and lie and yell and finagle about . By golly , the lie detectors know who 's lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card machines know how the law runs on whatever the case is about , and they can find out a helluva sight quicker'n you can say habeas corpus what judges did about cases like that before . And that settles it . No more of this fast footwork . Hell , if I had a lie detector and card machines and all , I could run a law business here and fix you up with a divorce or a million dollar damage suit or whatever you needed whatsoever while you were sticking your feet and a dime into that shoeshine machine . " Used to be sort of high and mighty , sort of priests , those doctors and lawyers and all , but they 're beginning to look more and more like mechanics . Dentists are holding up pretty good , though . They 're the exception that proves the rule , I say . And barbering  --  one of the oldest professions on earth , incidentally  --  has held up better than all the rest . Machines separated the men from the boys , you Wright say . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say in the Army , Sergeant Elm Wheeler would . Memphis boy . Here we go , boys , ' he 'd say . Here 's where we separate the men from the boys . ' And off we 'd go for the next hill , and the medics 'd follow and separate the dead from the wounded . And then Wheeler 'd say , Here we go , here 's where we separate the men from the boys . ' And that went on till we got separated from our battalion and Wheeler got his head separated from his shoulders . " But you know , terrible as that mess was  --  not just Wheeler , but the whole war  --  it brought out the greatness in the Americanpeople . There 's something about war that brings out greatness . I hate to say that , but it 's true . Of course , maybe that 's because you can get great so quick in a war . Just one damn fool thing for a couple of seconds , and you 're great . I could be the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butp178I 'd have to prove it with a lifetime of great haircutting , and then nobody 'd notice . That 's just the way peacetime things are , v , ' u know ? But Elm Wheeler , you could n't help but notice him when he went hog-wild after he got a letter from his wife saying she 'd had a baby , and he had n't seen her for two years . Why , he read that and ran up to a machine-gun nest and shot and hand-grenaded everybody in it something awful , then he ran up to another one and mashed up all the people there with his rifle butt , and then , after he 'd busted that , he started after a mortar emplacement with a rock in each hand , and they got him with a shell fragment . You could of paid a surgeon a thousand dollars , and he could n't of done a nicer job . Well , Elm Wheeler got the Congressional Medal for that , and they laid it in his coffin with him . Just laid it there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they 'd put it on his chest , I expect they 'd of had to use solder , he was so full of lead and scrap iron . But he was great , and nobody 'd argue about that , but do you think he could of been great today , in this modern day and age ? Wheeler ? Elm Wheeler ? You know what he would be today ? A Reek and Wreck , that 's all . The war made him , and this life would of killed him . " And another nice thing about war  --  not that anything about war is nice , I guess  --  is that while it 's going on and you 're in it , you never worry about doing the right thing . See ? Up there , fighting and all , you could n't be righter . You could of been a heller at home and made a lot of people unhappy and all , and been a dumb , mean bastard , but you 're king over there  --  king to everybody , and especially to yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you ca n't be false to anybody else , and that 's it  --  in a hole , being shot at and shooting back . " These kids in the Army now , that 's just a place to keep ' em off the streets and out of trouble , because there is n't anything else to do with them . And the only chance they 'll ever get to be anybody is if there 's a war . That 's the only chance in the world they got of showing anybody they lived and died , and for something , by God . " Used to be there was a lot of damn fool things a dumb bastard could do to be great , but the machines fixed that . Youp179know , used to be you could go to sea on a big clipper ship or a fishing ship and be a big hero in a storm . Or maybe you could be a pioneer and go out west and lead the people and make trails and chase away Indians and all that . Or you could be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be a dumb bastard . " Now the machines take all the dangerous jobs , and the dumb bastards just get tucked away in big bunches of prefabs that look like the end of a game of Monopoly , or in barracks , and there 's nothing for them to do but set there and kind of hope for a big fire where maybe they can run into a burning building in front of everybody and run out with a baby in their arms . Or maybe hope  --  though they do n't say so out loud because the last one was so terrible  --  for another war . Course , there is n't going to be another one . " And , oh , I guess machines have made things a lot better . I 'd be a fool to say they have n't , though there 's plenty who say they have n't , and I can see what they mean , all right . It does seem like the machines took all the good jobs , where a man could be true to hisself and false . to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I guess I 'm just about the end of a race , standing here on my own two feet . " And I 'm lucky barbering held out as long as it did  --  long enough to take care of me . And I 'm glad I do n't have any kids . That way it comes out even , and I do n't have to think about this shop not being here for them , about nothing being for them but the Army or the Reeks and Wrecks , probably  --  unless an engineer or manager or research man or bureaucrat got at my wife , and the kids had their brains instead of mine . But Clara 'd let one of those jerks at her just about as quick as you could stuff a pound of oleomargerine up a cat 's ass with a hot awl . " Anyway , I hope they keep those barber machines out of Miami Beach for another two years , and then I 'll be ready to retire and the hell with them . They had the man who invented the damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's a barber hisself . Said he kept worrying and worrying about somebody was going to invent a haircutting machine that 'd put him out of business . And he 'd have nightmares about it , and when he 'd wake up from them , he 'd tell hisself all the reasonsi8o PLAYER PIANOp180why they could n't ever make a machine that 'd do the job  --  you know , all the complicated motions a barber goes through . And then , in his next nightmare , he 'd dream of a machine that did one of the jobs , like combing , and he 'd see how it worked clear as a bell . And it was just a vicious circle . He 'd dream . Then he 'd tell hisself something the machine could n't do . Then he 'd dream of a machine , and he 'd see just how a machine could do what he 'd said it could n't do . And on and on , until he 'd dreamed up a whole machine that cut hair like nobody 's business . And he sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't guess he has to worry about anything any more . " Ever stop to think what a funny thing the human mind is ? And there you are , sir , how 's that look to you ? " " Sumklish , " said the Shah , and he took a long drink from the flash Khashdrahr handed him . He studied himself soberly in the mirror Bigley held up for him . " Nibo bakula ni provo , " he said at last . " He likes it ? " asked Bigley . " He says it 's nothing a turban wo n't cover , " said Khashdrahr , whose haircut was also over . He called to Halyard . " Your turn , Doctor . " " Hmmm ? " said Halyard absently , looking up from the letter . " Oh  --  no haircut for me . Think we ought to go back to the hotel for a rest , eh ? " He glanced at the letter once more : My dear Mr. Halyard : We have just completed an audit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them against the facts . During this audit , it was discovered that you failed to meet the physical-education requirements for a bachelor 's degree from Cornell University , and that the degree was awarded you through a clerical oversight of this deficiency . I regret to inform you that you are , therefore , technically without a bachelor 's degree , and , hence , technically ineligible for the M.A. and Ph.D . degrees which also appear on your record .

THE MOON WAS full over the Thousand Islands , and , on one of them at least , there were a thousand eyes to see it . The cream of the East and Middle West , engineeringwise and managerwise , was met in the amphitheater of the Meadows . It was the second night , the night of the keynote play and the bonfire . The stage in the center of the circling stone seats was hidden beneath a pair of steel quarter-spheres , which would presently open like the shells of a steamed quahog . Kroner sat down next to Paul and laid his hand on Paul 's knee . " Nice night , boy . " " Yessir . " " Think we 've got a good team this year , Paul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day of competition , the Blue Team did look good , good despite the large proportion of top  --  hence tired and old  --  executives in its ranks . That afternoonthe Blues had knocked the captain of the Greens , Shepherd , out of the box after three innings . Shepherd , in his determination to win and his horror of losing , had blown up completely . Paul , by contrast , had played heads-up ball all the way , ef-182 PLAYER PIANOp182fortlessly , laughingly , wholly out of character . In analyzing the magical quality of the afternoon during the cocktail hour , Paul realized what had happened : for the first time since he 'd made up his mind to quit , he really had n't given a damn about the system , about the Meadows , about intramural politics . He 'd tried not to give a damn before , but he had n't had much luck . Now , suddenly , as of the afternoon , he was his own man . Paul was half tight , and pleased with himself . Everything was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start the meeting shortly after his plane lands , " said Kroner , " so we 'll have to leave whatever 's going on . " " O.K. , " said Paul . " Swell . " Swell night , tangy air , and a drowsy sort of harmlessness over everything . Maybe he 'd give notice tonight , if he felt like it . No hurry . " Fine . " " Everybody in their seats , please , " said the loudspeaker . " Will everybody take their seats . The Program Committee has just informed me that we are eight minutes behind time , so will everybody take their seats . " Everybody ( lid . The band , wearing summer tuxedos , struck up a medley of Meadows favorites . The music faded . The quarter-spheresopened a trifle at the top , freeing a beam of light that shot through cigarette smoke to the deep-blue heavens . The music stopped , machinery underground grumbled , and the quarter-spheres sank into the earth , revealing : An old man , with a white beard reaching to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a blue conical hat speckled with golden stars , sits atop an extraordinarily tall stepladder . He looks wise , just , and tired by responsibility . In one hand he holds a large dust cloth . Beside the ladder , and of the same height , is a slender pole . Another just like it stands across the stage . Between the two poles is a loop of wire , passing , like a clothesline , over pulleys fixed to the poles . Hanging from the wire are a series of metallic stars about two feet across . They are coated with fluorescentpaint , so that a beam of invisible infrared light , playing on one star , then another , makes them come alive with dazzling color . The old man , oblivious to the audience , contemplates the stars strung out before him , unhooks the star nearest to him , studies its surface , polishes a tarnished spot on it , shakes his head sadly , andp183lets the star fall . He looks down at the fallen star with regret , then at those still on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . OLD MAN . I am the Sky Manager . It is I who keep night skies shining brightly ; I who , when a star 's glory is tarnishedbeyond restoration , must take it from the firmament . Every hundred years I climb my ladder to keep the heavens bright . And now my time has come again . ( He pulls on the wire , bringing another star within reach . He removes the star and examines it . ) And this is a strange star to be shining in the modernheavens . And yet , a hundred years ago , when I last kept my vigil , it was proud and new , and only a few meteors , destroying themselves in a brilliant instant , shone more brightly than this . ( He holds upthe star , and the infrared light makes it glow brightly , bringing out the lettering which says , " Labor Unionism . " He dusts it desultorily , shrugs , and lets it drop . ) In brave company . ( Looks down at scrapheap . ) With stars named Rugged Individualism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and  --  ( Leaves sentence unfinished , and sighs . ) It is not an easy job , not always a pleasant one . But One far wiser than I , infinitely good , has decreed that it must be done ( sighs ) , and be done dispassionately . ( He pulls on wire , and brings in another star , the biggestof all . The infrared light hits it , and it lights up brilliantly , and on it is the image of the Oak , the symbol of the organization . ) Alas , a young beauty . But already there are those who hate the sight of it , who clamor for it to be tornfrom the heavens . ( He dabs at it with his dust cloth , shrugs , and holds the star at arm 's length , preparatory to dropping it . ) Enter a clean-cut , handsome young engineer from audience . YOUNG ENG . ( Shakes foot of ladder . ) No ! No , Sky Manager , no ! OLD MAN . ( Looks down curiously . ) What is this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young radical through trap door in stage . RADICAL . ( Sneeringly ) Take it down . YOUNG ENG . There 's never been a more brilliant , beautiful star !  |p184RADICAL  . There 's never been a bloodier , blacker one ! OLD MAN . ( Looks perplexedly from the two men to the starand back . ) Hmmmm . Are you prepared to appeal the fate of this star with reason rather than emotion ? My duties require that I be the sworn enemy of emotion . YOUNG ENG . I am ! RADICAL . I , too . ( Smiles . ) And I promise to take very little of your time . CLOSE QUARTER-SPHERES . OPEN QUARTER-SPHERES . A tall judge 's rostrum now surrounds the old man 's ladder . The old man wears a judge 's wig and robes . The radical and the young engineer are similarly robed and wigged after the fashion of Englishbarristers . OFFSTAGEVOICE . Oyez , oyez , oyez ! The Court of Celestial Relations is now in session ! OLD MAN . ( Bangs with gavel . ) Order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Offensively ingratiating . ) Your honor , ladies andgentlemen of the jury , the prosecution will show that the star in question is as tarnished  --  nay , black !  --  as any ever hung in the heavens . I will call but one witness , but that witness in effect is a million witnesses , each of whom could tell the same sordid tale , tell the unvarnished truth in the same simple words from the heart . I 'd like to call John Averageman to the stand . OFFSTAGEVOICE . John Averageman , John Averageman . Take thestand , please . Enter John Averageman through trap door in stage floor . ( He is slightly pudgy , shy , middle-aged , endearing . His clothes are cheap , verging on being comical . He is in awe of the court , and has perhaps had a couple of drinks to bolster his nerve . ) RADICAL . ( Touches John 's arm . ) I 'm looking out for you , John . Take your time about answering . Do n't letp185them rattle you . Let me do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OFFSTAGEVOICE . Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help you God ? JOHN . ( Looks questioningly at radical . ) Do I ? RADICAL . You do . JOHN . Yessir , I do . RADICAL . John , suppose you tell the court what you did before the war , before this new star arose to spoil , to besmirchthe heavens . JOHN . I was a machinist in the Averagetown Works of theAveragetown Manufacturing Company . RADICAL . And now ? JOHN . I 'm in the Reconstruction and Reclamation Corps , sir . Shovelman First Class . RADICAL . Suppose , for the edification of the court , you tell us what you made before the star arose , and what you make now . JOHN . ( Stares upward , remembering and computing withdifficulty . ) Well , sir , when the defense work and all got going before the war , seems to me I could make better'n a hundred a week with overtime . Best week I ever had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I get thirty a week . RADICAL . Uh-huh . In other words , as that star went up , your income dropped . To be exact , John , your income dropped about eighty per cent . YOUNG ENG . ( Jumps to feet impulsively , likably . ) Your honor , IOLD MAN . Wait until the cross-examination . YOUNG ENG . Yessir . Sorry , sir . RADICAL . I think we 've made it amply clear that the American standard of living has tumbled eighty per cent . ( Hisfeatures assume an annoyingly pious expression . ) But enough of merely materialistic considerations . What has the ascent of this star meant to John Averagemanin terms of his spirit ? John , tell the court what you told me . Remember ? About the engineers and managersJOHN . Yessir . ( Looks hesitantly at young engineer . ) Nooffense , sirp186RADICAL . ( Prodding . ) The truth can never be spoken without someone getting hurt , John . Go right ahead . JOHN . Well , sir , it hurts a man a lot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge , the engineers and managers , just sort of look right through him like they do n't see him . A guy likes to know somebodythinks enough of him to look out for him . YOUNG ENG . ( Urgently ) Your honor ! OLD MAN . ( Severely ) I will not tolerate any further interruptionsfrom you . The issues are far graver than I thought . ( To radical ) Please proceed . RADICAL . Go ahead , John . JOHN . Well , sir , that 's just about it . Kind of summing up , seems like these days the engineers and managers and the like are everything , and the average man is just nothing any more . RADICAL . ( Pretends to be overcome by the tragedy of John 's testimony . After seemingly searching for words and struggling with emotion for thirty seconds , he at last speaks , choked up and angry . ) Star of wonder , starof might ; star of wondrous beauty bright . Take itdown . ( Shakes fist . ) Take it down ! ( Gestures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people  --  the people , yes . " Take it down ! " they say . Who is it that says , " Leave it up ? " Who ? Not John , not the people . Who ? ( Dramatically , he producesa pamphlet from his breast pocket . ) Yourhonor , ladies and gentlemen of the jury ( reads from pamphlet ) , at the start of the war , the average incomefor engineers and managers in this great land of ours was $8,449.27 . Now , on this poisoned night , as the black star reaches its zenith , eighty per cent of John Averageman 's pay check has been wrenched from him . And what is the average pay check for engineers and managers , you ask ? ( Reads from the pamphlet again , with bitter emphasis on every syllable . ) Fifty-seven thousand eight hundred and ninety-six dollars and forty-one cents ! ( Explosively . ) Your witness ! ( Radical slinks over to the far post and leans against it to watch contemptuously . ) YOUNG ENG . ( Softly , kindly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOUNG ENG . John , tell me  --  when you had this large income , before the star arose , did you by any chance have a twentyeightinch television set ? JOHN . ( Puzzled ) No , sir . YOUNG ENG . Or a laundry console or a radar stove or an electronic dust precipitator ? JOHN . No , sir , I did n't . Them things were for the rich folks . YOUNG ENG . And tell me , John , when you had all that money , did you have a social insurance package that paid all of your medical bills , all of your dentist bills , and provided for food , housing , clothes , and pocket money in your old age ? JOHN . No , sir . There was n't no such thing then , in those days . YOUNG ENG . But you have them now , now that the ( sarcastically ) black star has risen , have n't you ? JOHN . Yessir , that 's right , I do . ButYOUNG ENG . John , you 've heard of Julius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you suppose that Caesar , with all his power and wealth , with the world at his feet , do you suppose he had what you , Mr. Averageman , have today ? JOHN . ( Surprised ) Come to think of it , he did n't . Huh ! What do you know ? RADICAL . ( Furiously ) I object ! What has Caesar got to do with it ? YOUNG ENG . Your honor , the point I was trying to make was that John , here , since the star in question has risen , has become far richer than the wildest dreams of Caesar or Napoleon or Henry VIII ! Or any emperor in history ! Thirty dollars , John  --  yes , that is how much money you make . But , not with all his gold and armies could Charlemagne have gotten one single electric lamp or vacuum tube ! He would have given anything to get the security and health package you have , John . But could he get it ? No ! JOHN . Well , for heaven 's sakes ! ButYOUNG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engineersand managers have forgotten Mr. Averageman ? JOHN . Yessir , that 's what I was going to say . YOUNG ENG . John , do you know that no manager or engineer would have a job if it were n't for you ? How couldp188we forget you for even a minute , when every minute of our lives is spent trying to give you what you want ! Do you know who my boss is , John ? JOHN . Do n't believe I ever met the gentleman . YOUNG ENG . ( Smiling ) Oh , I think maybe you have . He 's you , John ! If I ca n't give you what you want , I 'm through . We 're all through , and down comes the star . JOHN . ( Blushing ) Gosh , I never looked at it quite that way before , sir . ( Laughs modestly . ) But I guess that 's right , is n't it ? What do you know about that ? ButYOUNG ENG . But I make too much money ? Fifty-seven thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's a lot of money . YOUNG ENG . John , before that star arose , the payroll for producingwhat I produce for you , for my boss , Mr. Averageman , ran to more than fifty-seven thousand dollars a week . Not a year , mind you , but a week ! It looks to me , John , like you , the consumer , are the big winner , not me . JOHN . ( Whistles low , under his breath . ) Is that a fact ! ( Points suddenly at radical , who is very restive . ) But , he saidYOUNG ENG . We 've answered everything he 's said , John . And I 'd like to add one little thought . He 'd like to take advantage of your good nature . He wants power , and he does n't care about anything else . He 'd like to make you swallow his half-truths , John , and get you to help him pull down the star , and put himself in power , and the whole world back in the Dark Ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , would he ? ( Radical looks worried , then frightened and chagrined , and suddenly makes dash for trap door in stage . John is right after him , and trap door closes . Stage lights fade , and blue feature spot comes up on young engineer , who moves directly to center of stage . Band starts " Battle Hymn of the Republic " softly , almost imperceptibly . ) YOUNG ENG . ( Reflectively , soberly , conversationally ) Yes , thereare those who 've clamored so loudly against our star that some have been convinced it is tarnished . And if that star were to come down , it would be partly our fault . Yes , ours ! Every minute of the day we should he pointing out how beautiful it is , and whyp189it is beautiful . We hold our peace too much . ( Points at star . Infrared beam hits it , making it glow beautifully . ) Under it , we 've become rich beyond the wildest dreams of the past ! Civilization has reached the dizziest heights of all time ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point seven times as many television sets as all the rest of the world put together ! ( Music gets louder . ) Ninety-three per cent of all the world 's electrostatic dust precipitators ! Seventy-seven per cent of all the world 's automobiles ! Ninety-eight per cent of its helicopters ! Eighty-one point nine per cent of its refrigerators ! ( Music gets louder still . ) Seventy-one point three per cent of the world 's generatingcapacity ! Eighty-five per cent of its industrial control vacuum tubes ! Sixty-nine per cent of its fractional horsepower motors ! Ninety-eight point three per cent of .. . ( Music crescendos , drowning him out . ) ( Fade feature spot . Launch rockets from shore . ) CLOSE QUARTER-SPHERES . OPEN QUARTER-SPHERES . The young engineer is gone , and so are the trappings of the court . The old man is at the top of his ladder , alone with his stars , as he was at the beginning . He holds out the star bearing the image of the Oak , smiles , hooks it onto the wire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OLD MAN . Yes , out it goes again , brighter than all the rest . ( Hereaches under his robe , and comes out with a powerfulflashlight , whose beam he aims directly upward . ) And when I come back to examine the stars for stains in another century , will it gleam as it does now ? Or ? ( Looks meaningfully at the foot of the ladder . ) Well , what determines whether it will be tarnished or not ? ( Looks at the audience . ) It depends on  --  ( Suddenly brings down the flashlight , so its beam strikes facep189after face after face in the audience . ) You ! AndYou ! And You ! etc . ( Fire rockets . Hit " Stars and Stripes Forever " hard . ) CLOSE QUARTER-SPHERES . ( Turn on amphitheater floodlights . ) Kroner 's hand crashed down on Paul 's knee . " Phwew ! The best keynoter yet ! Paul  --  the story , the whole story in a nutshell ! " " You 'll be interested in knowing  --  " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest : In the past , the keynote plays have been written by professional writers under our supervision . This play you 've just seen was written , believeit or not , by an engineer and manager within the organization ! Bill Holdermann , stand up ! Stand up ! Stand up , Bill ! " The audience went wild . " I knew it ! " shouted Kroner . " It was real ! It went right to the heart . It had to be somebody inside ! " Holdermann , a shaggy , worn-out nobody from the IndianapolisWorks , stood a few rows ahead of Paul , red , smiling , and with tears in his eyes . At the sunset of life , he had arrived . Perhaps a muffled wisp of the applause reached the ears of his wife , the woman who had had faith in him when no one else had , across the water , on the Mainland . " Bonfire in five minutes , " said the loudspeaker . " Five minutes to make new contacts , then the bonfire . " Shepherd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Paul . " Not with all his gold and armies , ' " Shepherd quoted from the play . " Not with all his gold and armies could Charlemagne have gotten one single electric lamp or vacuum tube ! " He shook his head wonderingly , admiringly . " Do n't tell me art is dying . " " Art who ? " said Paul under his breath , and he walked away from them , into the twilight at the fringe of the ring of floodlights . The rest of the crowd drifted , tightly packed , toward the shore , where Luke Lubbock , Alfy , and others of the service staff were pouring kerosene on a hillock of pine fagots . The play was virtually the same play that had begun every Meadows session , even before the war , when the island hadp191belonged to a steel company . Twenty years ago , Paul 's father had brought him up here , and the play 's message had been the same : that the common man was n't nearly as grateful as he should be for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radicals were the cause of the ingratitude . When Paul had first seen the allegory , as a teen-ager , he 'd been moved deeply . He had been struck full force by its sublime clarity and simplicity . It was a story in a nutshell , and the heroic struggle against ingratitude was made so vivid for his young mind that he 'd worshipped his father for a little while as a fighter , a latter-day Richard the Lionhearted . " Well , " his father had said after that first play , years ago , " what are you thinking , Paul ? " " I had no idea  --  no idea that 's what was going on . " " That 's the story , " his father had said sadly . " The whole story . That 's the way it is . " " Yessir . " Their eyes had met , and an inexpressibly sweet sense of eternal tragedy had passed between them , between their generations  --  a legacy of Weltschmerz as old as humanity . Now , Paul stood by himself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Kroner put it , the men at the head of the procession of civilization , the openers of doors to undreamed-of new worlds . This silly playlet seemed to satisfy them completely as a picture of what they were doing , why they were doing it , and who was against them , and why some people were against them . It was a beautifully simple picture these procession leadershad . It was as though a navigator , in order to free his mind of worries , had erased all the reefs from his maps . Suddenly , light flashed in Paul 's eyes , but less dazzling light than the Sky Manager 's . He faced his own image in a mirror framed by fluorescent lamps . Over the mirror was the legend , THE BEST MAN IN THE WORLD FOR THE BEST JOB IN THEWORLD . The island was covered with such booby traps . The lamps about this mirror were old ones , and they gave off a wavering light tinged with greens and purples . They gave his skin the quality of corroded copper , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was nothing disquietingabout seeing himself dead . An awakening conscience , unaccompaniedby new wisdom , made his life so damned lonely , hep192decided he would n't much mind being dead . And the good offices of the cocktail hour were wearing away . A drone in the sky to the east distracted him  --  probably the amphibian bearing the priceless two hundred and fifty pounds of Doctor Francis Eldgrin Gelhorne , and his know-how . Paul took a step down the path , which turned off the lights , and headed back toward the bonfire , which was sending sparks and flames up hundreds of feet and turning the faces about it to a sweaty pink . A professional actor , painted bronze , wearing an eagle-feather war bonnet and a beaded G-string , held up his hand and tilted his head back proudly . The crowd fell silent . " How ! " He looked earnestly from face to face . " How ! Many moons ago , my people made their home on this island . " The amphibian was circling the island now , coming lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whispered Kroner to Paul . " Would n't look good to walk out on the ceremony , though . We 'll have to stick it out . " " My people were brave people , " said the Indian . " My people were proud and honest people . My people worked hard , played hard , fought hard , until it was time to go to the Happy HuntingGround . " The same actor had been hired to play the Indian for years , ever since Paul had been coming to the Meadows . He 'd been hired originally for his deep voice and beautiful muscles . Now , Paul noticed , his belly cast a shadow over his G-string , his left calf had developed a varicose vein , and war paint failed to hide the gray bags under his eyes . He had become such a regular at the Meadows , such a vital symbol  --  surpassed in that functiononly by Doctor Gelhorne and the Oak  --  that he was a man apart from the other hired help , on a first-name footing with the brass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now our braves are gone , our strong young men  --  gone from this island , which belonged to my people , lo , these many moons ago , " said the Indian . " Now other young men come . But the spirit of my people lives on , the Spirit of the Meadows . It is everywhere : in the wind through the pines , in the lapping of the great blue water , in the whir of an eagle wing , in the growl of summer thunder . No man can call this island his , no manp193can be happy here , who does not harken to the Spirit , who does not take the Oath of the Spirit . " There was the clattering of the switch in the loudspeaker again . " Young braves at the Meadows for the first time step forward , " said a pontifical voice , not that of the usual drover . " Raise your right hands , " said the Indian . " Repeat after me the Oath of the Spirit of the Meadows . I solemnly swear by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice in the pines , " said the neophytes . " By the lapping of the great blue water , by the whir of the eagle wing  --  " The Old Man 's plane had skated across the water to the shore on the other side of the island and was roaring its enginesas it inched up a ramp onto land . " By the growl of the summer thunder , " said the Indian . " By the growl of the summer thunder . " " I will uphold the Sprit of the Meadows , " said the Indian . " I will obey the wise commands of my chiefs , for the good of the people . I will work and fight fearlessly , tirelessly for a better world . I will never say the job is done . I will uphold the honor of my profession and what I represent at all times . I will seek out enemies of the people , enemies of a better world for all children , relentlessly . " " Relentlessly ! " said someone in the crowd near Paul , passionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept into the mainstream of pomp and circumstance , held his hand high and swore to everything that came along . In Luke 's left hand was a fire extinguisher , apparently for use in case the blaze spread . When the oath was done , the Indian looked and saw it was good . " The Spirit of the Meadows is pleased , " he said . " The Meadows belong to these stout-hearted braves , and it shall be a proud , happy place as it was , lo , these many moons ago . " A smoke bomb concealed before him screened him for a startling instant , and he was gone . " The saloon is open , " said the loudspeaker . " The saloon is open , and will be open until midnight . " Paul found himself walking beside the pleasant youngster he 'd met at lunch , Doctor Edmund Harrison of the Ithacap194Works . Shepherd and Berringer were right behind , flattering the life out of Kroner . " Well , how 'd you like it , Ed ? " said Paul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seemed to think it inadvisable . " Very well done , " he said carefully . " Very professional . " " Jesus Christ , " Berringer was saying , " I mean , Christ , boy , that was a show . You know , it 's entertainment , and still you learn something , too . Christ ! When you do both , that 's art , boy . Christ , and that was n't cheap to put on , either , I 'll bet . " Ed Harrison of Ithaca stopped and picked up a bit of stone from the side of the path . " I 'll be damned , " he said . " An arrowhead ! " " A nice one , too , " said Paul , admiring the relic . " So there really were Indians on this island , " said Harrison . " For chrissakes , you crazy bastard , " said Berringer . " You deaf , dumb , and blind ? Whaddya think they been trying to tell you for the past half-hour ? " THE MEETING OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Executive Manager of National Industrial Security , and Francis Eldgrin Gelhorne , National Industrial , Commercial , Communications , Foodstuffs , and Resources Director , was to take place at the Meadows in the so-called Council House . The Council House was a frame building , away from the rest , that had been built in the old , wilder days as a lazaretto for surly drunks . Drinking at the Meadows had become more careful since the war  --  more mature , Kroner said  --  so the pesthousefell into disuse and was finally converted into a meeting place for top-policy brass . All save Doctor Gelhorne were now seated around a long meeting table , looking thoughtfully at the empty chair Gelhornewould be filling any minute . It was a time for silence . The mixing , the making of new contacts , the packing up ofp195troubles in old kit bags went on noisily across the island , in the saloon . Here in the Council House there was no joy , only the summer-cottage aroma of mildew and incipient dry rot , and a grave awareness on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their apple . The shouts and songs that floated over the greensward from the saloon , Paul noted , had a piping quality . There was n't the inimitable hoarseness of an honest-to-God drunk in the lot . It was unthinkable that there was a man in the saloon without a glass in his hand , but it was also unlikely that many men would have their glasses filled more than twice . They did n't drink at the Meadows now the way they used to in the old days when Finnerty and Shepherd and Paul had joined the organization . It used to be that they 'd come up to the Meadows to relax and really tie one on as a relief from the terribly hard work of war production . Now the point seemed to be to pretenddrunkenness , but to stay sober and discard only those inhibitions and motor skills one could safely do without . Paul supposed there would be a couple of men who would n't realize what was going on , who would earnestly try to get as drunk as everyone else seemed . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . And there would be one or two lonely drunks with nothing to lose anyway , men who had fallen into disfavor one way or another , who knew they had received their last invitation . And what the hell , the liquor wasfree . De mortuis nil nisi bonum . There was a voice on the porch of the Council House . Doctor Gelhorne was on the other side of the door , pausing a moment for some last word with the world outside . " Look at those youngsters over there , " Paul heard the Old Man say , " and tell me God is n't in his heaven . " As the doorknob turned , Paul continued to contemplate trivia , to atomize the fixtures and conventions of the only way of life he 'd ever known , an easy , comfortable life , with simple answers for every doubt . That he was quitting that life , that now was perhaps the time he would do it  --  the grand idea overshadowingall the little ones  --  rarely occupied his consciousness . It showed itself mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then of standing in a chilling wind . Maybe thep196right time to quit would come now , or a few months from now . There was no need to hurry , no need at all . The door opened . The three waiting men stood . In came Doctor Francis Eldgrin Gelhorne , National Industrial , Commercial , Communications , Foodstuffs , and Resources Director . His spherical bulk was enclosed in a double-breasted , dark-blue suit . His single concession to the Meadows ' tradition of informality was an unbuttoned collar and the sliding of his necktie knot a fraction of an inch below where it should have been . Though he was seventy , his hair was as thick and black as a twenty-year-old Mexican 's . His fatness was turned into something impressive rather than comical by his perpetual I-smell-excrement expression . He seemed to be the end of a race , as , Paul reflected , so many leaders seemed to be . It was hard to believe that when Gelhorne was gone there would ever be another man as wonderfullyold , shrewd , and unafraid as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here because somebody wants to kill us , wreck the plants , and take over the country . That plain enough for you ? " Everyone nodded . " The Ghost Shirt Society , " said Doctor Lou MacCleary , Executive Manager of National Industrial Security . " The Ghost Shirt Society , " said Doctor Gelhorne acidly . " Give a name to something , and you think you 've got it . But you have n't got it . All you 've got 's the name . That 's why we 're here . All we 've got is the name . " " Yessir , " said Lou . " The Ghost Shirt Society . And we think the headquarters is in Ilium . " " We think , " said Doctor Gelhorne . " We do n't know any-thing . " " Yessir , " said Lou . Gelhorne fidgeted for a moment and looked about the room . His eyes fell on Paul . " How are you , Doctor Proteus ? " " Fine , thank you , sir . " " Uh-huh . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacCleary . " Let 's see that report of yours that tells everything we do n't know about the Ghost Shirt Society . "  |p197MacCleary  gave him a thick typewritten manuscript . Gelhorne , his lips moving , leafed through it , frowning . No one spoke or smiled or looked at anyone else . Paul considered the notion of Doctor Gelhorne 's being the last of a race , and decided it was true . He had got to the top through a disorderly route that the personnel machines would never tolerate . Had machines been watching things when Gelhornestarted his climb to the top , his classification card would have come flying out of the card files like an old Wheaties box top . He had no college degree of any kind , other than bouquets of honorary doctorates that had come to him in his late fifties and sixties . He 'd had nothing to do with industry , in fact , until he was thirty . Before that , he 'd pulled a mail-order taxidermy business out of bankruptcy , sold his interest in it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to five trucks when he received a hot market tip , sold his business , invested the proceeds , and tripled his wealth . With this bonanza , he 'd bought the largest , yet failing , ice-cream plant in Indianapolis , and put the business in the black inside of a year by building ice-cream routes servicing Indianapolis manufacturing plants during the lunch hour . In another year , he had his trucks carrying sandwiches and coffee along with ice cream . In another year , he was running plant cafeterias all over town , and the ice-cream business had become a minor division of Gelhorne Enterprises . He 'd found that many of the manufacturing firms were owned by third- or fourth-generation heirs who , by some seeminglaw of decay , did n't have the nerve or interest the plants ' founders had had . Gelhorne , half playfully at first , had offered these heirs advice , and found them amazingly eager to surrenderresponsibility . He 'd bought in , watched and learned , and , discovering nerve was as valuable as special knowledge , he 'd become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When war became certain and the largest corporations were looking about for new manufacturing facilities , Gelhorne had delivered his prosperous community of plants to General Steel , and become an officer of that corporation . The rule-of-thumb familiarity he had with many different industries , as repre/sented by the plants he 'd taken over , had been broader than that of any executives General Steel had developed within its own organization , and Gelhorne was soon spending all his time at the side of the corporation 's war-rattled president . There he 'd come to the attention of Paul 's father in Washington , and Paul 's father had made Gelhorne his general executive manager when the whole economy had been made one flesh . When Paul 's father died , Gelhorne had taken over . It could never happen again . The machines would never stand for it . Paul remembered a week end long ago , when he had been a tall , skinny , polite , and easily embarrassed youth , and Gelhorne had paid a call . Gelhorne had suddenly reached out and caught Paul by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy . " " Yessir ? " " Paul , your father tells me you 're real smart . " Paul had nodded uncomfortably . " That 's good , Paul , but that is n't enough . " " No , sir . " " Do n't be bluffed . " " No , sir , I wo n't . " " Everybody 's shaking in his boots , so do n't be bluffed . " " No , sir . " " Nobody 's so damn well educated that you ca n't learn ninety per cent of what he knows in six weeks . The other ten per cent is decoration . " " Yes , sir . " " Show me a specialist , and I 'll show you a man who 's so scared he 's dug a hole for himself to hide in . " " Yes , sir . " " Almost nobody 's competent , Paul . It 's enough to make youc cry to see how bad most people are at their jobs . If you can do a half-assed job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the blind . " " Yes , sir . " " Want to be rich , Paul ? " " Yes , sir  --  I guess so . Yes , sir . " " All right . I got rich , and I told you ninety per cent of what I know about it . The rest is decoration . All right ? " 1 " Yes , sir . " Now , after many years , Paul and Doctor Francis Eldgrin Gelhorne were looking at each other over the long table in the Council House at the Meadows . They were n't close friends , and there was none of Kroner 's aromatic paternalism about Gelhorne . This was business . " There 's nothing new about the Society in this report , " said Gelhorne . " Only the part about Finnerty , " said Lou MacCleary . " It 's been slow going . " " It certainly has , " said Doctor Gelhorne . " Well , Doctor Proteus and Doctor Kroner , the point is that this Ghost Shirt nonsense might turn out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been able to get an agent into it to find out what they 're up to or who 's running it . " " This bunch is smart , " said Lou . " They 're being pretty selective about who gets in . " " But we think we know how to get a man into it , " said Gelhorne . " We think they 'd be very tempted by a discontented manager and engineer . We think they 've already recruited at least one . " " Finnerty , " said Kroner heavily . " He finally registered with the police , incidentally . " " Oh ? " said MacCleary . " What did he say he was doing with his time ? " " Says he 's getting out Braille editions of pornography . " " He 's being pretty cute now , " said Gelhorne , " but I think we 'll fix his wagon all right . But that 's a side issue . The point we 're getting at , Paul , is that I think they 'll take you into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conditions , sir ? " " If we fire you . As of now , as far as anyone outside this room knows , you 're through . The rumor 's already circulating at the saloon , is n't it , Lou ? " " Yes , sir . I let it slip in front of Shepherd at dinner . " " Good boy , " said Gelhorne . " He 'll be taking over Ilium , by the way . " " Sir , about Pittsburgh  --  " said Kroner worriedly . " I prom-Lp200ised Paul that he was slated for that job when he was finished with the investigation . " " That 's right . In the meanwhile , Garth will run the works there . " Gelhorne stood briskly . " All right , Paul ? Everything clear ? You 're to get off the island tonight and back to Ilium . " He smiled . " It 's really a break for you , Paul . It gives you a chance to clear up your record . " " Record , sir ? Things were happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word and repeat it as a question in order to keep in the conversation . " That business of letting Finnerty go through the plant unescorted , and the pistol affair . " " The pistol affair , " said Paul . " Can I tell my wife ? " " I 'm afraid not , " said Lou . " The plan is that nobody outsidethis room is to know . " " It 'll be hard , I know , " said Gelhorne sympathetically . " But just now I 'm remembering a young boy who told me he did n't want to be an engineer when he grew up , he wanted to be a soldier . You know who that boy was , Paul ? " " Me ? " said Paul bleakly . " You . Well , now you 're in the front lines , and we 're proud of you . " " Your father would be proud of you , Paul , " said Kroner . " I guess he would . He really would be , would n't he , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat of anger . " Sir , Doctor Gelhorne , may I say one more thing before you leave ? " Kroner was holding the door open for the Old Man . " All right , by all means . " " I quit . " Gelhorne , Kroner , and MacCleary laughed . " Wonderful , " said the Old Man . " That 's the spirit . Keep that up , and you 'll fool the hell out of them . " " I mean it ! I 'm sick of the whole childish , stupid , blind operation . " " Attaboy , " said Kroner , smiling encouragingly . " Give us two minutes to get to the saloon before you leave , " said MacCleary . " Would n't do for us to be seen together now . And do n't worry about packing . Your stuff is being packedp201right now , and it 'll be down at the dock in time for the last boat . " He shut the door behind himself , Gelhorne , and Kroner . Paul sank heavily back into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit , " he said . " Do you hear me ? I quit ! " " What a night , " he heard Lou say on the porch . " God smiles on the Meadows , " said Doctor Gelhorne . " Look ! " said Kroner . " The moon ? " said Lou . " It is beautiful . " " The moon , yes  --  but look at the Oak . " " Oh  --  and the man , " said Doctor Gelhorne . " What do you know about that ! " " A man , standing there alone with the Oak , with God and the Oak , " said Kroner . " Is the photographer around ? " said Lou . " Too late  --  he 's going away now , " said Kroner . " Who was he ? " said Doctor Gelhorne . " We 'll never know , " said Lou . " I do n't want to know , " said Kroner . " I want to rememberthis scene and think of him as a little bit of all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Old Man . " That 's good , that 's good . " Paul , alone inside , exhaled a puff of smoke with too much force , and coughed . The men on the porch whispered something . " Well , gentlemen , " said Doctor Gelhorne , " shall we go ? " IF DOCTOR PAUL PROTEUS , former manager of the Ilium Works , had n't found reality disquieting at all points , he would n't have shown himself in the saloon before boarding the last boat for the Mainland . As he made his way along the gravel path toward the noise and light of the saloon , however , the field of his consciousness narrowed down to a pinprick , and filling the field was a twinkling shot-glass . The crowd fell silent as he entered , and then exploded intop202even greater excesses of happy noise . Quickly as Paul glanced about the room , he did n't catch a single man looking at him , nor , in the blurred vision of excitement , did he recognize a single face among these old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bartender . " Sorry , sir . " " Sorry about what ? " " I ca n't serve you . " " Why not ? " " I 've been told you 're no longer a guest at the Meadows , sir . " There was a prim satisfaction in the bartender 's voice . A number of people observed the incident , Kroner among them , but no one made a move to change the bartender 's ruling . It was a crude moment , and in its fetid atmosphere Paul made an ultimately crude suggestion to the bartender , and turned to leave with dignity . What he still had to learn was that without rank , without guest privileges , he lived on a primitive level of social justice . He was n't prepared when the bartender vaulted the bar and spun him around . " Nobody says that to me , sonny Jim , " said the bartender . " Who the hell do you think you are ? " said Paul . " I 'm no goddamn saboteur , " said the bartender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , one that permittedno muttering withdrawal , no shaking of hands and forgetting it . Son-of-a-bitch could be softened with a smile , but not saboteur . Somehow the idea of a wrecker of machines had become the smallest part of the word , like the crown of an iceberg . The greatest part of its mass , the part that called forth such poisonousemotions , was undefined : an amalgam of perversions , filth , disease , a galaxy of traits , any one of which would make a man a despicable outcast . The saboteur was n't a wrecker of machines but an image every man prided himself on being unlike . The saboteur was the man who , if dead , would no longer make the world a trying place to live in . " You want me to say it again ? " said the bartender . " Saboteur . You 're a stinking saboteur . " It was an electrifying situation , an elemental situation . Herep203one big man had offered the ultimate insult to another big man . No one looked as though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or as though he thought he could . It was like seeing a man caught in a threshing machine , beyond saving . As long as God had precipitated the tragedy , the onlookers might as well watch and learn what a threshing machine would do to a man once it caught him . Paul had n't hit anyone since his sophomore year in high school . He had none of what bayonet instructors hoped to instill in their pupils , the will to close with the enemy . It was an unpromising sort of will , he thought . Still , obedient to some system of involuntary nerves and glands , his hands tightened into fists , and his feet spaced themselves to form a solid bipod from which to swing . Just as there is no encore for the 1812 Overture save " The Stars and Stripes Forever , " so Paul had no choice of rejoinders . " Saboteur yourself , " he said evenly , and swung at the bartender 's nose . Absurdly , the bartender collapsed , snuffling and snorting . Paul walked out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boone , like the bargeman on the book jacket , like  --  He was suddenly spun around again . For a split second , he saw the bartender 's red nose , white face , white apron , and white fist . A brilliant flash illuminated the inside of his skull , and then midnight . " Doctor Proteus  --  Paul . " Paul opened his eyes to find himself staring up at the Big Dipper . A cool breeze played across his aching head , and he could n't see where the voice was coming from . Someone had stretched him out on the cement bench that ran the length of the dock , to be loaded with the band and the outgoing mail aboard the last boat for the Mainland . " Doctor Proteus  --  " Paul sat up . His lower lip was shredded and puffed , and his mouth tasted of blood . " Paul , sir  --  " The voice seemed to be coming from behind the spiraea hedge at the foot of the dock . " Who 's that ? " Young Doctor Edmund Harrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " I thought you might want this . " " That 's real Christian of you , Doctor Harrison . Guess I 'm well enough to sit up and take nourishment now . " " Wish I 'd thought of it . It was Kroner 's idea . " " Oh ? Any message ? " " Yes  --  but I do n't think you 'll want it . I would n't , if I were in your spot . " " Go ahead . " " He says to tell you it 's always darkest before the dawn , and every cloud has a silver lining . " " Urn . " " But you ought to see the bartender , " said Harrison brightly . " Aaaaaah . Tell me all . " " He 's got a nosebleed that wo n't stop because he ca n't stop sneezing . Looks like a vicious circle that with luck could last for years . " " Wonderful . " Paul felt better . " Look , you 'd better beat it before your luck runs out and somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what on earth you did ? " " It 's a long , sordid story . " " I guess . Boy ! one day you 're king , the next day you 're out on your tail . What 're you going to do ? " Talking softly there in the dark , Paul began to appreciate what a remarkable young man he 'd picked to sit down beside the first day  --  this Ed Harrison . Harrison had apparently taken a liking to Paul , and now , with no personal reasons for turning against Paul , he was sticking with him as a friend . This was integrity , all right , and a rare variety , because it often amounted , as it might amount now , to career suicide . " What am I going to do ? Farm , maybe . I 've got a nice little farm . " " Farm , eh ? " Harrison clucked his tongue reflectively . " Farm . Sounds wonderful . I 've thought of that : up in the morning with the sun ; working out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . If I had the money , sometimes I think maybe I 'd throw this  --  " " You want a piece of advice from a tired old man ? " " Depends on which tired old man . You ? "  | " Me . Do n't put one foot in your job and the other in your dreams , Ed . Go ahead and quit , or resign yourself to this life . It 's just too much of a temptation for fate to split you right up the middle before you 've made up your mind which way to go . " " That 's what happened to you ? " " Something like that . " He handed Harrison the empty glass . " Thanks , better beat it . Tell Doctor Kroner it never rains but what it pours . " The cabin cruiser , Spirit of the Meadows , grumbled into her slip , and Paul climbed aboard . A few minutes later the band got on with their instruments , and a last call was put out over the loudspeakers . The lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobered roisterers crossed the parade ground to their tents . The rattle of the switch , the scratch of a needle , and the loudspeakers sang for the last time that night : " Fare thee well , for I must leave you , Please do n't let this parting grieve you ; Fare thee well , the time has come for us tosay goodbye . Adieu , adieu , kind friends , adieu , yes , adieu ! ... " And Paul waved wanly , apathetically . This was goodbye to his life so far , to the whole of his father 's life . He had n't had the satisfaction of telling someone he 'd quit , of being believed ; but he 'd quit . Goodbye . None of this had anything to do with him any more . Better to be nothing than a blind doorman at the head of civilization 's parade . And as Paul said these things to himself , a wave of sadness washed over them as though they 'd been written in sand . He was understanding now that no man could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a red clay field , a mountain slope , a rocky coast , a city street . In black loam , in mud or sand or rock or asphalt or carpet , every man had his roots down deep  --  in home . A lump grew in his throat , and he could n't do anything about it . Doctor Paul Proteus was saying goodbye foreverto home. 2o6 PLAYER PIANO " So long , " he said . And then , in spite of himself , " So long , gang . " A laggard group , genuinely inebriated , was being coaxed out of the saloon . They were singing an effusively sentimental rendition of " Toast the Oak . " They draped their arms over each other 's shoulders ; and made clumsily for the great tree . Their voices came clearly to Paul over the flat , green lawns : " Grown from but an acorn , Giant now you are ; May you ne'er stop growing ; Rise to the stars ! Proud sy-him-bol a-hovOurrrrrrrrs . " There was a reverent pause , broken by an exclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Berringer 's word . " ' Smatter ? " " Look at the tree  --  around the bottom ! " " Holy smokes ! " " Somebody 's stripped the bark off clear around , " said Berringerhollowly . " Who ? " " Who do you think ? " said Berringer . " That stinking saboteur . Where is he ? " The Spirit of the Meadows gunned her engines and backed into open water . " Hey , " cried a lonely , frightened voice in the night . " Hey  --  somebody 's killed the Oak . " " Killed the Oak , " echoed the shore . The loudspeakers clattered on again , and a chilling war whoop filled the air . " Beware the Ghost Shirt ! " shrieked a terriblevoice . " Ghost Shirt , " said the shore , and all was deathly still . CHAPTER XXIVEN ROUTE BY air from Miami Beach to Ithaca , New York , home of Cornell University , the Shah of Bratpuhr caught ap207nasty cold . When seven prakhouls ( that quantity of fluid that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of Sumklish improved the Shah 's spirits but did nothing for his respiratory system , it was decided that the plane should land in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , in order that the Shah might rest and try the magic of American medicine . With seven prakhouls of Sumklish under his belt , the Shah called cheery messages to pretty female Takarus on his way to the doctor 's office . " Pitty fit-fit , sibi Takaru ? Niki fit-fit . Akka sahn nibo fitfit , sinii Takaru ? " Khashdrahr , who was without the benefit of Sumklish , was livid with embarrassment . " Shah says it is a nice day , " he explainedunhappily . " Fit-fit , pu sibi bonanza ? " called the Shah to a small blonde who had her hands in a streetcorner manicure machine . She blushed , and jerked her hands from the machine and stalked away , leaving the machine to buff away at nothingness . A street urchin stuck his grubby hands in for the remainder of the operation , and drew them out with gleaming , red-enameled nails . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glumly . For many weeks now , they 'd traveled without the subject 's coming up once , and Halyard had hopefully told himself that the Shah really was different from his other guests ih this respect , different from the French and Bolivians and Czechs and Japanese and Panamanians and Yaps and . . . . But , no . The Shah , too , was now getting curious about American-type women . Halyard , at a frightful price in dignity , was once more going to have to perform the role of utterly perfect host  --  or pimp . " Fit-fit ? " called the Shah , as they pulled up to a stoplight . " Look , " said Halyard reproachfully to Khashdrahr , " tell him he just ca n't walk up to any American girl at all and ask her to sleep with him . I 'll see what I can do , but it wo n't be easy . " Khashdrahr told the Shah , who waved him away . Before anyone could stop him , the Shah was out on the sidewalk , confidently confronting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sibi Takaru ? " 208 PLAYER PIANO " Please , " said Halyard to her , " please excuse my friend . He 's a bit under the weather . " She took the Shah 's arm , and together they climbed back into the limousine . " I 'm afraid there 's been a terrible misunderstanding , young lady , " said Halyard . " I hardly know how to put it . I , ah , he , that is  --  What I mean to say , rather , is he was n't offering you a ride . " " He was asking for something , was n't he ? " " Yes . " " There 's been no misunderstanding . " " Fit-fit , " said the Shah . " Quite so , " said Halyard . Khashdrahr began looking out of the window with fresh interest , wildness , in fact , and Halyard had difficulty holding himself in check . " Here we are , " said the driver . " Here 's Doctor Pepkowitz 's office . " " Yes , well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halyard , " while the Shah goes in here for a cold treatment . " The Shah was grinning , and inhaling and exhaling rapidly . " His sniffles are gone , " said Khashdrahr wonderingly . " Drive on , " said Halyard . He had seen a similar miracle cure of an Ecuadorian brigadier 's hives . The girl seemed restless and unhappy , and utterly out of character , Halyard thought . She smiled constantly , unconvincingly , and was apparently anxious to get the whole thing over with . Halyard still could n't believe that she knew what the whole thing was . " Where are we going now ? " she said , grimly cheerful . " A hotel , I suppose . " " Yes , " said Halyard unevenly . " Good . " She patted the Shah on his shoulder , and burst into tears . The Shah was distressed and tried clumsily to comfort her . " Oh , nibo souri , sibi Takaru . Akka sahn souri ? Ohhh . Tipi Takaru . Ahhhh . " " There , now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't do this every day , " she said , blowing her nose . " Please excuse me . I 'll try to be better . " " Certainly . We understand , " said Halyard . " The whole thing has been a terrible mistake . Where would you like us to leave you off ? " " Oh , no  --  I 'm going through with it , " she said gloomily . " Please  --  " said Halyard . " Perhaps it would be better for all concerned if  --  " " If I lost my husband ? Better if he shot himself or starved ? " " Certainly not ! But why would those terrible things happen if you refused to  --  That is  --  " " It 's a long story . " She dried her eyes . " My husband , Ed , is a writer . " " What 's his classification number ? " said Halyard . " That 's just it . He has n't one . " " Then how can you call him a writer ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " My dear girl , " said Halyard paternally , " on that basis , we 're all writers . " " Two days ago he had a number  --  W  --  441 . " " Fiction novice , " Halyard explained to Khashdrahr . " Yes , " she said , " and he was to have it until he 'd completed his novel . After that , he was supposed to get either a W  --  44o  --  " " Fiction journeyman , " said Halyard . " Or a W-255 . " " Public relations , " said Halyard . " Please , what , are public relations ? " said Khashdrahr . " That profession , " said Halyard , quoting by memory from the Manual , " that profession specializing in the cultivation , by applied psychology in mass communication media , of favorable public opinion with regard to controversial issues and institutions , without being offensive to anyone of importance , and with the continued stability of the economy and society its primary goal . " " Oh well , never mind , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sibi Takaru . " " Two months ago he submitted his finished manuscript to the National Council of Arts and Letters for criticism and assignment to one of the book clubs . " 210 PLAYER PIANO " There are twelve of them , " Halyard interrupted . " Each one selects books for a specific type of reader . " " There are twelve types of readers ? " said Khashdrahr . " There is now talk of a thirteenth and fourteenth , " said Halyard . " The line has to be drawn somewhere , of course , because of the economics of the thing . In order to be selfsupporting , a book club has to have at least a half-million members , or it is n't worth setting up the machinery  --  the electronicbillers , the electronic addressers , the electronic wrappers , the electronic presses , and the electronic dividend computers . " " And the electronic writers , " said the girl bitterly . " That 'll come , that 'll come , " said Halyard . " But Lord knows getting manuscripts is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the thing . One of the smaller clubs , for instance , covers four city blocks . DSM . " " DSM ? " said Khashdrahr . " Excuse me . Dog Story of the Month . " Khashdrahr and the Shah shook their heads slowly and made clucking sounds . " Four city blocks , " echoed Khashdrahr hollowly . " Well , a fully automatic setup like that makes culture very cheap . Book costs less than seven packs of chewing gum . And there are picture clubs , too  --  pictures for your walls at amazinglycheap prices . Matter of fact , culture 's so cheap , a man figured he could insulate his house cheaper with books and prints than he could with rockwool . Do n't think it 's true , but it 's a cute story with a good point . " " And painters are well supported under this club system ? " asked Khashdrahr . " Supported  --  I guess ! " said Halyard . " It 's the Golden Age of Art , with millions of dollars a year poured into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grecos , Degas ' , da Vincis , Michelangelos . . . " " These club members , they get just any book , any picture ? " asked Khashdrahr . " I should say not ! A lot of research goes into what 's run off , believe me . Surveys of public reading tastes , readability and appeal tests on books being considered . Heavens , runningp2IIoff an unpopular book would put a club out of business like that ! " He snapped his fingers ominously . " The way they keep culture so cheap is by knowing in advance what and how much of it people want . They get it right , right down to the color of the jacket . Gutenberg would be amazed . " " Gutenberg ? " said Khashdrahr . " Sure  --  the man who invented movable type . First man to mass-produce Bibles . " " Alla sutta takki ? " said the Shah . " Eh ? " said Halyard . " Shah wants to know if he made a survey first . " " Anyway , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Council . " " Badly written , " said Halyard primly . " The standards are high . " " Beautifully written , " she said patiently . " But it was twentysevenpages longer than the maximum length ; its readability quotient was 26.3 , and  --  " " No club will touch anything with an R.Q. above 17 , " explainedHalyard . " And , " the girl continued , " it had an antimachine theme . " Halyard 's eyebrows arched high . " Well ! I should hope they would n't print it ! What on earth does he think he 's doing ? Good lord , you 're lucky if he is n't behind bars , inciting to advocate the commission of sabotage like that . He did n't really think somebody 'd print it , did he ? " " He did n't care . He had to write it , so he wrote it . " " Why does n't he write about clipper ships , or something like that ? This book about the old days on the Erie Canal  --  the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that barechestedstuff . " She shrugged helplessly . " Because he never got mad at clipper ships or the Erie Canal , I guess . " " He sounds very maladjusted , " said Halyard distastefully . " If you ask me , my dear , he needs the help of a competent psychiatrist . They do wonderful things in psychiatry these days . Take perfectly hopeless cases , and turn them into grade A citizens . Does n't he believe in psychiatry ? "  | " Yes , indeed . He watched his brother find peace of mind through psychiatry . That 's why he wo n't have anything to do with it . " " I do n't follow . Is n't his brother happy ? " r " Utterly and always happy . And my husband says somebody'sjust got to be maladjusted ; that somebody 's got to be uncomfortable enough to wonder where people are , where they 're going , and why they 're going there . That was the trouble with his book . It raised those questions , and was rejected . So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story has a happy ending after all , " said Halyard . " Hardly . He refused . " " Lordy ! " " Yes . He was notified that , unless he reported for publicrelationsduty by yesterday , his subsistence , his housing permit , his health and security package , everything , would be revoked . So today , when you came along , I was wandering around town , wondering what on earth a girl could do these days to make a few dollars . There are n't many things . " " This husband of yours , he 'd rather have his wife a  --  Rather , have her  --  " Halyard cleared his throat  --  " than go into public relations ? " " I 'm proud to say , " said the girl , " that he 's one of the few men on earth with a little self-respect left . " Khashdrahr translated this last bit , and the Shah shook his head sadly . The Shah removed a ruby ring and pressed it into her hand . " Ti , sibi Takaru . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brahouna to tippo a mismit . " He opened the limousine door for her . " What did the gentleman say ? " she asked . " He said to take the ring , pretty little citizen , " said Khashdrahrtenderly . " He said goodbye and good luck , and that some of the greatest prophets were crazy as bedbugs . " " Thank you , sir , " she said , climbing out and starting to cry again . " God bless you . " The limousine pulled away from her . The Shah waved wistfully . " Dibo , sibi Takaru , " he said , and was seized by a violent sneezing fit . He blew his nose . " Sumklish ! " Khashdrahr handed him the sacred flask . PLAYER PIANO 213p213WHEN THE SPIRIT OF THE MEADOWS churned up to the dock at the Mainland , the public address system , turned low , was murmuring " Good Night , Sweetheart , " a sweet wraith of music a whisper above the voice in the pines , the lapping of the great blue water , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women 's and children 's lodges . In the Central Administration Building was a single square of light , silhouetting a sleeping clerk . As Paul made for it , to ask the clerk where he might find Anita , lights flashed in his night-accustomed eyes . When his pupils had adjusted themselves to the glare , he found himself staring at his reflection in a mirror again , under the legend , THE BEST WIFE FOR THE BEST MAN FOR THE BEST JOB IN THE WORLD . He hurried past the mirror , wondering how many times Anita had contemplated her reflection and the legend here , wondering how she would take the news that her Best Man had become merely a man , with no job at all . He woke up the clerk , who called the matron in charge of the lodge where Anita slept . " What 's matter with the party over there ? " said the clerk sleepily , waiting for the matron to answer . " You 're about the tenth guy to come over here tonight . Usually they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's the matter with the matron , anyway ? The phone 's right by her bunk . " He glanced at the clock . " You know what time it is ? You have n't got time to make a nickel . The last boat back for the island leaves in three minutes . " " Keep ringing . I 'm not going back . " " If you 're going to spend the night , do n't tell me about it . There 're about twenty-seven rules against it . " Paul handed him a ten-dollar bill . " Keep ringing . " " For that , you can be invisible for a week . Whaddya like ? Blondes , brunettes , redheads ? Aha ! She answered . Where the hell you been ? " he asked the matron . " You got a Mrs. Paulp214Proteus there ? " He nodded . " Uh-huh , uh-huh . O.K. Leave a note on her bunk , will you . " He turned to Paul . " She 's out , Doctor . " " Out ? " " Walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great walker . " If Anita was a great walker , it was news to Paul . He 'd seen her drive a car to the house across the street from theirs , and she denied all the tenets of physical culture by remaining young and graceful while eating like a farmhand and conserving her strength like a princess . Bound feet and six-inch fingernails would n't have restricted her activities in the least . Paul sat down on a wicker chair in the cool blue shadows of the Administration Building 's porch and rested his feet on the peeling bark of the log railing to wait . Now the lights along the walks blinked on and off , a silent signal , warning that the last boat was about to leave for the island . There was laughing , and quick crunching in the gravel , and a couple ran from the woods toward the dock . Their insistence on keeping their arms about each other 's waists made their progress as graceless as a sack race . This annoyed Paul as a critic . It was painful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long experience with the skilled Anita , how much like a dance it could be when done properly . There  --  she was making him slow down now , and their gait through the trees , against the moon , was more orderly . Paul had been sure that the farewell kiss would be an ungainly business , but , all credit to her , they stopped , and took the time and stances to do it right . Good . Paul watched them with increasing identification with the man . Paul had always been a petty thief of others ' high moments , and his hunger for this particular sort of moment was acute . With his old life gone , and his new one , whatever it was to be , not yet begun , he was voracious for love  --  Anita 's love , vividly imagined love , vicarious love  --  any love , whatever was immediately available . Now she was coming back , slowly , thoughtfully , content . Wonderful.  |p215The  lights on the booby-trap mirror flashed on . The woman smoothed her slacks over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingered before her image a long time , turning this way and that , seemingly pleased , as well she might be , by the shape of her breasts ingenuously hidden under tight green cotton , with the word " Captain " undulating uphill , downdale . " Anita ! " She jumped , and quickly folded her arms across her bosom in a protective gesture . Slowly her arms went to her sides again , and she stood erect , a woman with nothing to hide , least of all Shepherd 's shirt . " Hello , Paul . " She walked over to the porch where he sat , stately , cold , and sat down beside him . " Well ? " When he said nothing , her poise began to fail , and she plucked nervously at the bark on the log railing , pulling off little strips and throwing them out into the summer night . " Go ahead , " she said at last . " Me go ahead ? " said Paul . " Do n't you think an explanation is in order ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did n't you ? " " Yes , but not for breaking a Commandment . " " Is wearing another man 's shirt adultery in your book ? " Underneath , she was plainly rattled . Paul was delighted . He was sure now that he could bluff her into coming away with him . It was inconceivable that she was using the boring , sententious , contentious Shepherd for anything but a hollow threat to him , but this semblance of wrongdoing could now be turned to advantage . " Would n't you say the shirt was symptomatic , coupled with fornication in the underbrush ? " he said . " If you mean do I love him , the answer is yes . " Paul laughed quietly . " I 'm glad you 're taking it so well , " she said primly . " I guess it proves what I thought all along . " " Which was  --  ? " Unexpectedly she burst into tears . " That I was n't any damn use to you at all ! Finnerty was right , " she sobbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a woman , covered with sponge rubber , and heated to body temperature . " It was Paul 's turn to be startled . " Anita  --  darling , listen . " " And you 'd lend it to anybody , if you did n't need it just then . " " Hell 's bells , I  --  " " I 'm sick of being treated like a machine ! You go around talking about what engineers and managers do to all the other poor , dumb people . Just look what an engineer and manager did to me ! " " For heaven 's sakes , sweetheart , I  --  " " You talk about how wrong it is for smart people to lord it over people who are n't so smart , and then go around our house showing off your great big I.Q. like it was on a sandwichsign . All right , so I 'm dumb . " " No you are n't , Angel . Listen , I  --  " " Saboteur ! " Paul fell back in his seat and shook his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the love of God , listen , will you ? " he begged . " Go on . " She was magnificently on top of the situation again . " Darling , what you say may be true . I do n't know . But please , sweetheart , wife , I need you now like I never needed anybody in all my life . " " Ten minutes ought to take care of that . At the outside , " she added scornfully . " For richer , for poorer , in sickness as in health , " said Paul . " Remember that , Anita ? Do you remember ? " " You 're still rich , and you 're not sick . " She looked at him with passing concern . " You 're not sick , are you ? " " At heart . " " You 'll get used to it . I did . " " I 'm sorry , Anita  --  I did n't know it had been that bad . I see now that it probably was . " " Next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He needs me , respects me , believes in the things I believein. " 1 " I hope you 'll be very happy , " said Paul , standing . Her lips trembled , and she burst into tears again . " Paul , Paul , Paul . " " Hmmmm ? " " I like you . Do n't forget that ever . " " And I like you , Anita . " " Doctor Proteus , " called the clerk through the window . " Yes ? " " Doctor Kroner called and said you were to be driven over to the railroad station tonight . The jeep 's on the other side of the building , waiting . We 've got half an hour to make the 12 : 52 . " " Coming . " " Kiss me , " said Anita . It was a stunning kiss , and , in its wake of lackadaisicalness , Paul realized that she had had absolutely nothing to gain by the kiss , that she had done it out of , of all things , the goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he whispered " I 'm not as dumb as you think . " She pushed him away firmly . " Goodbye . " DOCTOR PAUL PROTEUS , an unclassified human being , was put aboard the 12 : 52 , where he shared an ancient coach , half cuspidor , half humidor , with sixty troops on furlough from Camp Drum . " Great Bend . The stop is Great Bend , " said a tape recording through a loudspeaker over Paul 's head . The engineer pressed a button in his cab as he pulled into each station , down came the steps , and out came the voice . " Next station , Carthage . Next station , Carthage . Click . " " ' Board ! " bawled another loudspeaker on the outside of the car . An old man , kissing his wife goodbye on the rotting planks of the Great Bend platform , looked apologetically at the urgentp218voice , as though to ask the man to wait just a second more for him to say one last word . " Board ! " Machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nestled into one another , and disappeared into their niche . " Coming ! Coming ! " cried the old man , and jogged unhappily toward the moving train as fast as his brittle legs would carry him . He caught the handrail , swung aboard , and stood panting in the vestibule . He fumbled for his ticket , dropped it into the mechanism on the door . The mechanism considered it , found everything in order , pulled back the door bolt , and let him into the frieze and cast-iron monument to tobacco . He settled , winded , in the seat next to Paul 's . " Son-of-abitchwo n't even wait a second for an old man , " he said bitterly . " It 's a machine , " said Paul . " All automatic . " " Do n't mean he ai n't a son-of-a-bitch . " Paul nodded appreciatively . " Used to be conductor on this line . " " Oh ? " The man had the florid , righteous look of a specializedbore , and Paul was n't interested in listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " For-tee-wunnnn years ! " " Huh ! " " For-tee-wunnnn . Two times twenty plus one . And I 'd like to see one of them machines deliver a baby . " " Huh ! You delivered a baby , eh ? " ' " Yep . Little boy . By coincidence I done it in the men 's room . " He chuckled richly . " For-tee-wunnnn years ! " " Huh . " " And I never seen the machine yet that 'd watch out for a little girl three years old all the way from St. Louis to Pough-keepsie . " " Nope . Guess not , " said Paul . He filed this remark away for his next meeting with Bud Calhoun . He could see the device now  --  sort of an Iron Maiden , without the spikes , of course , and electronic , of course , that would grasp a little girl firmly at St. Louis , and eject her into the arms of relatives at Poughkeepsie . " For-tee-wunnnn years ! With machines you get quan-titty , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Yup , " said Paul . " Carthage , " said the tape recording . " The stop is Carthage . Next station , Deer River . " Paul settled back against the unyielding seat with a sigh of relaxation , and closed his eyes in a pretense of sleep . " For-tee-wunnnn years ! These machines never help an old lady down the steps . " In time the old conductor ran out of examples of man 's superiority over machines and took to anticipating the tape recording'sstation calling , casually , contemptuously , as though any fool could do it . " Deer River . The stop is Deer River . Next station , Castorland . " " Deer River . The stop is Deer River , " said the tape recording . " Next station , Castorland . " " Ha ! What 'd I tell you ? " Paul actually did drop off to sleep fitfully , and at last , at Constableville , he saw his companion slipping his ticket into the door slot and being let off . Paul checked his ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would unlock the door at Ilium . He 'd heard tales of addled old ladies locked aboard cars for days for having misplaced their tickets , or for having missed their stops . Hardly a newspaper was printed that did n't have a human interest story about car clean-up crews from the Reeks and Wrecks liberating somebody . The old displaced conductor disappeared into the Constablevillenight , and Paul wondered at what thorough believers in mechanization most Americans were , even when their lives had been badly damaged by mechanization . The conductor 's plaint , like the lament of so many , was n't that it was unjust to take jobs from men and give them to machines , but that the machines did n't do nearly as many human things as good designers could have made them do . " Constableville . The stop is Constableville . Next station , Rem-sen . " A poker game was going on in the facing seats behind Paul , and a superannuated first sergeant , zebra-like under symbols for patience , individual bloodlettings , and separations from home , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War . " Jesus , " he said , riffling through the deck absently , as though220 PLAYER PIANOp220his mind were a thousand miles away , " there we was , and there they was . Imagine the men 's room there 's a hog-back , with the bastards dug in deep on the reverse slope . " The recruits looked at the men 's room through narrowed , battle-wise eyes , and the sergeant shuffled the cards some more . " The night before , a lucky shot knocked out the generator . " " Holy cow ! " said a recruit . " You can say that again , " said the sergeant . " Anyway  --  fivecardstud , nothing wild  --  there we were with no juice , eighteen of us facing five hundred of them . The microwave sentinels , the proximity mines , the electric fence , the fire-control system , the remote-control machine gun nests  --  pfft ! No juice , Queen , ace , ace , and dealer gets a deuce . Bet the first ace . " Well , boys  --  a dime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things interesting . Well , boys , then the fun started . At seven hundred hours they tried a hundred-man patrol on us , to see what we had . And we had nothin ' ! And communications was cut to hell , so we could n't call for nothin ' . All our robot tanks 'd been pulled out to support a push the 106th was makin ' , so we was really alone . Snafu . So , I sent Corporal Merganthaler back to battalion for help .  --  Two queens , no help , two aces , and dealer catches another lousy deuce . Bet the aces . So over they come , screamin ' bloody murder , and us with nothing but our goddamn rifles and bayonets workin ' . Looked like a tidal wave comin ' over at us.  --  Aces check ? Aw , hell , deuces 'll try a dime.  --  Just then , up comes Merganthaler with a truck and generator he 's moonlight-requisitioned from the 57th . We hooked her into our lines , cranked her up , and my God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bastards fryin ' on the electric fence , the proximity mines poppin ' under ' em , the microwave sentinels openin' ' up with the remote-control machine-gun nests , and the fire-control system swiveling the guns and flamethrowers around as long as anything was quiverin ' within a mile of the place . And that 's how I got the Silver Star . " Paul shook his head slightly as he listened to the sergeant 's absurd tale . That , then , was the war he had been so eager to get into at one time , the opportunity for basic , hot-tempered , hard-muscled heroism he regretted having missed . There had been plenty of death , plenty of pain , all right , and plenty ofp221tooth-grinding stoicism and nerve . But men had been called upon chiefly to endure by the side of the machines , the terrible engines that fought with their own kind for the right to gorge themselves on men . Horatio on the bridge had become a radioguidedrocket with an atomic warhead and a proximity fuse . Roland and Oliver had become a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flight of a man 's scream . The great tradition of the American rifleman survived only symbolically , in volleys fired into the skies over the dead in thousands of military cemeteries . Those in the graves , the front-line dead , were heirs to another American tradition as old as that of the rifleman , but once a peaceful tradition  --  that of the American tinker . " Gosh ! Sarge , how come you never went after a commis-sion ? " " Me go back to college at my age ? I 'm not the school kind , sonny . Gettin ' that B.S. was enough for me . Two more years and an M.A. for a pair of lousy gold bars ? Naaaaaah !  --  And a queen , and no help , and a jack , and no help , and a five , and no help , and dealer gets a  --  what do you know ? Three deuces . Looks like my lucky day , boys . " " Middleville . The stop is Middleville . Next station , Herki-mer . " " Sarge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Hmmm ? No  --  guess not . This ' un 's for a dose of Gamma rays at Kiukiang . This ' un 's  --  lemme see  --  radioactive dust in the bronchial tubes at Afyon Karahisar . And this little bastard  --  uh  --  trenchfoot at Kransystay . " " Sarge , what was the best piece you ever had ? " " A little redheaded half-Swede , half-Egyptian in Farafangana , " said the Sarge without hesitation . " Boy ! I hope that 's where they send me . " That much of a fine old American military tradition , Paul supposed , would always be alive  --  send me where the tail is . " Herkimer . The stop is Herkimer . Next station , Little Falls . " " Say , Sarge , is this train a local ? " " You might call it that . How 's about a round of cold hands for the odd change ? " said the sergeant . " O.K. with me . Oops . Lousy trey . A queen for Charley . Anp222eight for Lou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sarge catches a bullet . " " Say , Sarge , hear Pfc . Elmo Hacketts is shipping out . " " Yep . Been asking for overseas ever since he joined the outfit . Pair of treys for Ed , nothing for Charley , jack for Lou , and dealer catches a  --  I 'll be damned . " " Ace ! " " Little Falls . The stop is Little Falls . Next station , John-sonville . " " Here we go around again , and  --  What you know about that ? " said the sergeant . " Ed 's got three treys . Yep  --  hate to see Hacketts go . With a coupla years seasoning , I could see him as a helluva fine guidon bearer . But , if he wants to throw all that over , that 's his business . Nothing for Charley , and Lou gets my ace . Three treys got it so far . " " Where 's Hacketts going ? You know ? " " And no help , and help , and no help , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his orders came through today . Last time around , boys . No help , no help , no help , and  --  " " Jesus ! " " Sorry about that third ace , Ed . Guess that one 's mine too . Yeah , Hacketts gets his overseas duty all right . Shipping out for Tamanrasset tomorrow morning . " " Tamanrasset ? " " The Sahara Desert , you dumb bastard . Do n't you know any geography ? " He grinned wolfishly . " How about a little blackjackfor laughs ? " Paul sighed for Hacketts , born into a spiritual desert , now being shipped to where the earth was sterile , too . " Johnsonville . . . Ft . Plain . . . Fonda . . . Ft . Johnson . . . Amsterdam . . . Schenectady . . . Cohoes . . . Watervliet . . . Albany . . . Rensselaer . . . Ilium , the stop is Ilium . " Bleary-eyed , Paul shuffled to the door , inserted his ticket , and stepped onto the Ilium station platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coffin slid onto a waiting freight elevator and was taken into the refrigerated bowels of the station . No cabs had bothered to meet the unpromising train . Paul phoned the cab company , but no one answered . He lookedp223helplessly at the automatic ticket vendor , the automatic nylon vendor , the automatic coffee vendor , the automatic gum vendor , the automatic book vendor , the automatic newspaper vendor , the automatic toothbrush vendor , the automatic Coke vendor , the automatic shoeshine machine , the automatic photo studio , and walked out into the deserted streets on the Homestead side of the river . It was eight miles through Homestead , across the bridge , and up the other side of the river to home . Not home , Paul thought , but the house where his bed was . He felt dull , mushy inside , with an outer glaze of bright heat  --  sleepy yet sleepless , assailed by thoughts yet thoughtless . His footsteps echoed against Homestead 's gray facades , and lifeless neon tubes , proclaiming one thing and another of no importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want of the magic of electrons in flight through inert gas . " Lonesome ? " " Huh ? " A young woman , with bosoms like balloon spinnakers before the wind , looked down from a second-story window . " I said , are you lonesome ? " " Yes , " said Paul simply . " Come on up . " " Well , " Paul heard himself saying , " all right , I will . " " The door next to the Automagic Market . " He climbed the long , dark stairway , each riser of which proclaimedDoctor Harry Friedmann to be a painless dentist , licensedunder the National Security and Health Plan . " Why , " asked Friedmann rhetorically , " settle for less than a D-oo6 ? " The door on the hallway , next to Doctor Friedmann 's , was open , the woman waiting . " What 's your name , honey ? " " Proteus . " " Any relation to the big cheese across " the river ? " " My half-brother . " " You the black sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your brother . " " Please , " said Paul.  |p224He  awoke once during the remainder of the night with her , awoke from a dream in which he saw his father glowering at him from the foot of the bed . She mumbled in her sleep . As Paul dropped off once more , he murmured an automatic reply . " And I love you , Anita . " DOCTOR PAUL PROTEUS had been his own man , alone in his own house for a week . He 'd been expecting some sort of communication from Anita , but nothing came . There was nothing more , he realized wonderingly , to be said . She was still at the Mainland , probably . The Meadows session had another week to run . After that would come the muddle of her separatingher effects from his  --  and divorce . He wondered on what grounds she would divorce him . Extreme mental cruelty amused him , and he supposed it was close enough to the truth . Any variation from any norm pained her terribly . She 'd have to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds for divorce there were adultery , and incitement to conspire to advocatesabotage . A case could be made for either , he supposed , but not with dignity . Paul had gone to his farm once , and , in the manner of a man dedicating his life to God , he 'd asked Mr. Haycox to put him to work , guiding the hand of Nature . The hand he grasped so fervently , he soon discovered , was coarse and sluggish , hot and wet and smelly . And the charming little cottage he 'd taken as a symbol of the good life of a farmer was as irrelevant as a statue of Venus at the gate of a sewage-disposal plant . He had n't gone back . He 'd been to the Works once . The machinery had been shut off during the Meadows session , and only the guards were on duty . Four of them , now officious and scornful , had telephoned to Kroner at the Meadows for instructions . Then they 'd escortedhim to what had been his desk , where he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list of what he 'd taken ,  |p225and  questioned his claim to each item . Then they 'd marched him back into the outside world , and shut the gates against him foreverand ever . Paul was in the kitchen now , before the laundry console , seated on a stool , watching television . It was late afternoon , and , for the unadorned hell of it , he was doing his own laundry . " Urdle-urdle-urdle , " went the console . " Urdle-urdle-ur dull ! Znick . Bazz-wap ! " Chimes sounded . " Azzzzzzzzzz . Prompt " Up came the anticlimactic offering : three pairs of socks , three pairs of shorts , and the blue Meadow 's T-shirts , which he was using for pajamas . On the television screen , a middle-aged woman was counselingher teen-age son , whose hair and clothes were disordered and soiled . " Fightin ' do n't help , Jimmy , " she was saying sadly . " Lord knows nobody ever brought any more sunshine into the world by bloodyin ' somebody 's nose , or by havin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but he said my I.Q. was 59 , Ma ! " The boy was on the point of tears , he was so furious and hurt . " And he said Pop was a 53 ! " " Now , now  --  that 's just child 's talk . Do n't you pay it no mind , Jimmy . " " But it 's true , " said the boy brokenly . " Ma , it 's true . I went down to the police station and looked it up ! Fifty-nine , Ma ! and poor Pop with a 53 . " He turned his back , and his voice was a bitter whisper : " And you with a 47 , Ma . A 47 . " She bit her lip and looked heartbroken , then , seeming to draw strength miraculously from somewhere above eye level , she gripped the kitchen table . " Jimmy , look at your mother . " He turned slowly . " Jimmy , I.Q. is n't everything . Some of the unhappiest people in this world are the smartest ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , Paul had learned that this , with variations , was the basic problem situation in afternoon dramas , with diseases and injuries of the optic nerve and locomotor apparatus close seconds . One program was an interminable exploration of the question : can a woman226 PLAYER PIANOp226with a low I.Q. be happily married to a man with a high one ? The answer seemed to be yes and no . " Jimmy , boy , son  --  I.Q. wo n't get you happiness , and St. Peter do n't give I.Q. tests before he lets you in those Pearly Gates . The wickedest people that ever lived was the smartest . " Jimmy looked suspicious , then surprised , then guardedly willingto be convinced . " You mean  --  a plain fellow like me , just another guy , folks like us , Ma , you mean we 're as good as , as , as , well , Doctor Garson , the Works Manager ? " " Doctor Garson , with his 169 I.Q. ? Doctor Garson , with his Ph.D. , D.Sc. , and his Ph. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Him . " " Him ? Doctor Garson ? Jimmy , son , boy  --  have you seen the bags under his eyes ? Have you seen the lines in his face ? He 's carryin ' the world around on his shoulders , Jimmy . That 's what a high I.Q. got him , Doctor Garson . Do you know how old he is ? " " An awful old man , Ma . " " He 's ten years younger than your Pa , Jimmy . That 's what brains got him . " Pa came in at that moment , wearing the brassard of a Reconstructionand Reclamation Corps Asphalt Leveler , First Class . He was cheery , pink , in first-rate health . " Hi , there , folks , " he said . " Everything hunky-dory in my little old home , eh ? " Jimmy exchanged glances with his mother , and smiled oddly . " Yessir , reckon it is . I mean , you 're darn right it is ! " In came the organ music , the announcer , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volume . The door chimes were ringing , and Paul wondered how long they 'd been at it . He might have turned on the televiewer , to see if the bell ringer was worth opening the door for , but he was hungry for companionship  --  just about any kind  --  and he went to the door gladly , gratefully . A policeman looked at him coldly . " Doctor Proteus ? " " Yes ? " " I 'm from the police . " " So I see . "  | " You have n't registered . " " Oh . " Paul smiled . " Oh  --  I 've been meaning to do that . " And he had meant to do it , too . The policeman did not smile . " Then why have n't you ? " " I have n't found the time . " " You better start looking for it , hard , Doc . " Paul was annoyed by this rude young man , and he was inclined , as he had been inclined with the bartender at the Meadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought better of it this time . " All right . I 'll be down to register tomorrow morn-ing . " " You 'll be down to register in an hour , today , Doc . " The honorific Doc , Paul was learning , could be spoken in such a way as to make a man wish to God he 'd never come within ten miles of a university . " Yes  --  all right , whatever you say . " " And your industrial identification card  --  you 've failed to turn that in . " " Sorry . I 'll do that . " " And your firearms and ammunition permit . " " I 'll bring that . " " And your club membership card . " " I 'll find it . " " And your airline pass . " " All right . " " And your executive security and health policy . You 'll have to get a regular one . " " Whatever you say . " " I think that 's all . If anything else comes up , I 'll let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The young policeman 's expression softened suddenly , and he shook his head . " Lo ! How the mighty are fallen , eh , Doc ? " " Lo ! indeed , " said Paul . And an hour later Paul reported politely at the police station , with a shoebox full of revoked privileges . While he waited for someone to notice him , he interested himself in the radiophoto machine behind glass in one corner , which was fashioning a portrait of a fugitive , and noting be-228 PLAYER PIANOp228side it a brief biography . The portrait emerged from a slit in the top of the machine bit by bit  --  first the hair , then the brows , on line with the word WANTED , and then , on line with the large , fey eyes , the name : Edgar Rice Burroughs Hagstrohm , R &R-; 131313 . Hagstrohm 's sordid tale emerged along with his nose : " Hagstrohm cut up his M-17 home in Chicago with a blowtorch , went naked to the home of Mrs. Marion Frascati , the widow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods with him . Mrs. Frascati refused , and he disappeared into the bird sanctuary bordering the housing development . There he eluded police , and is believed to have made his escape droppingfrom a tree onto a passing freight  --  " " You ! " said the desk sergeant . " Proteus ! " Registration involved the filling out of a long , annoyingly complicated form that started with his name and highest classificationnumber , investigated his reasons for having fallen from grace , asked for the names of his closest friends and relatives , and ended with an oath of allegiance to the United States of America . Paul signed the document in the presence of two witnesses , and watched a coding clerk translate it , on a keyboard , into terms the machines could understand . Out came a card , freshly nicked and punched . " That 's all , " said the police sergeant . He dropped the card into a slot , and the card went racing through a system of switches and sidings , until it came to rest against a thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said Paul . The sergeant looked at the pile without interest . " Potential saboteurs . " " Wait a minute  --  what 's going on here ? Who says I am ? " " No reflection on you , " said the sergeant patiently . " Nobody'ssaid you are . It 's all automatic . The machines do it . " " What right have they got to say that about me ? " " Oh , they know , they know , " said the sergeant . " They 've been around . They do that with anybody who 's got more'n four years of college and no job . " He studied Paul through narrowed lids . " And you 'd be surprised , Doc , how right they are . " A detective walked in , perspiring and discouraged.  | " Any break on the Freeman case , Sid ? " said the sergeant , losing interest in Paul . " Nah . All the good suspects came off clean as a whistle on the lie detector . " " Did you check the tubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new set , had the circuits checked . Same thing . Innocent , every damn one of ' em . Not that every damn one of ' em would n't of liked to of knocked him off . " He shrugged . " Well , more leg work . We 've got one lead : the sistersays she saw a strange man around the back of Freeman 's house a half-hour before he got it . " " Got a description ? " " Partial . " He turned to the coding clerk . " Ready , Mac ? " " All set . Shoot . " " Medium height . Black shoes , blue suit . No tie . Wedding ring . Black hair , combed straight back . Clean-shaven . Warts on hands and back of neck . Slight limp . " The clerk , expressionless , punched keys as he talked . " Dinga-dinga-dinga-ding ! " went the machine , and out came a card . " Herbert J. van Antwerp , " said Mac . " Forty-nine fifty-six Collester Boulevard . " " Nice work , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Car 57 , car 57  --  proceed to . . . " As Paul walked into the bright sunlight of the street , a Black Maria , its siren silent , its tires humming the song of new rubber on hot tar , turned into the alleyway that ran behind the station house . Paul peered curiously at it as it stopped by a barred door . A policeman dismounted from the back of the shiny black vehicle and waved a riot gun at Paul . " All right , all right , no loitering there ! " Paul started to move on , lingering an instant longer for a glimpse of the prisoner , who sat deep in the wagon 's dark interior , misty , futile , between two more men with riot guns . " Go on , beat it ! " shouted the policeman at Paul again . Paul could n't believe that Ole man would actually loose his terrible hail of buckshot on a loiterer , and so loitered a momentlonger . His awe of the riot gun 's yawning bore was tern/pered by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting along in society than he had . The iron door of the station house clanged open , and three more armed policemen waited to receive the desperado . The prospect of his being at large in the alley for even a few seconds was so harrowing , seemingly , that the policeman who had been badgering Paul now gave his full attention to covering the eight or ten square feet the prisoner would cross in an instant . Paul saw his thumb release the safety catch by the trigger guard . " All righty , no funny stuff , you hear ? " said a nervous voice in the wagon . " Out you go ! " A moment later , Doctor Fred Garth , wearing a badly torn Blue Team shirt , unshaven , his eyes wide , emerged into the daylight , manacled and sneering . Before Paul could believe in the senseless scene , his old tentandteammate , his buddy , the man next in line for Pittsburgh , was inside . Paul hurried around to the front , and back into the officewhere he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sergeant looked up at him superciliously . " Yes ? " " Doctor Garth  --  what 's he doing here ? " said Paul . " Garth ? We got no Garth here . " " I saw them bring him in the back door . " " Naah . " The sergeant went back to his reading . " Look  --  he 's one of my best friends . " " Should of stuck with your dog and your mother , " said the sergeant without looking up . " Beat it . " Bewildered , Paul wandered back to the street , left his old car parked in front of the station house , and walked up the hill to the main street of Homestead , to the saloon at the foot of the bridge . The town hall clock struck four . It might have struck midnightor seven or one , for all the difference it made to Paul . He did n't have to be anywhere at any time any more  --  ever , he supposed . He made up his own reasons for going somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to do anywhere . The economy was no longer interested . His card was of interest now only to the police machines , who regardedp231him , the instant his card was introduced , with instinctive distrust . The hydrant was going as usual , and Paul joined the crowd . He found himself soothed by the cool spray from the water . He waited with eagerness for the small boy to finish fashioning his paper boat , and enjoyed the craft 's jolting progress toward certaindestruction in the dark , gurgling unknown of the storm sewer . " Interesting , Doc ? " Paul turned to find Alfy , the television shark , at his elbow . " Well ! Thought you were at the Meadows . " " Thought you were . How 's the lip ? " " Healing . Tender . " " If it 's any consolation , Doc , the bartender 's still sneezing . " " Good , wonderful . Did you get fired ? " " Did n't you know ? Everybody got sacked , the whole service staff , after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing their own cooking , making their own beds , raking the horseshoe pits , and all , all by theirselves . " " Everybody ? " " Everybody below works manager . " " They 're cleaning their own latrines , too ? " " The dumb bunnies , Doc , with I.Q. 's under 140 . " " What a thing . Still play games , do they ? " " Yep . Last I heard , Blue was way out ahead . " " You do n't mean it ! " " Yeah , they were so ashamed of you , they just about killed theirselves to win . " " And Green ? " " Cellar . " " In spite of Shepherd ? " " You mean Jim Thorpe ? Yeah , he entered everything , and tried to make every point . " " So  --  " " So nobody made any points . Last I heard , his team was trying to convince him he had virus pneumonia and ought to spend a couple of days in the infirmary . He 's got something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his watch . " Say , there 's some chamber music on channel seven . Care to play ? "  | " Not with you . " " Just for the hell of it . No money . I 'm just getting checked out on chamber music . A whole new field . C'm on , Doc , we 'll learn together . You watch the cello and bass , and I 'll watch the viola and violin . O.K. ? Then we 'll compare notes and pool our knowledge . " " I 'll buy you a beer . How 's that ? " " That 's good ; that 's very good . " In the bar 's damp twilight , Paul saw a teen-ager looking at him hopefully from a booth . Before him , on the table top , were three rows of matches : three in the first row , five in the second , seven in the third . " Hello , " said the young man uneasily , hopefully . " Very interestinggame here . The object of the game is to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many or as few as you want from any given row at each turn . " " Well  --  " said Paul . " Go ahead , " said Alfy . " For two dollars ? " said the youngster nervously . " All right , for two . " Paul took a match from the longest row . The youngster frowned and looked worried , and countered . Three moves later , Paul left him looking disconsolately at the last match . " Goddammit , Alfy , " he said miserably , " look at that . I lost . " " This is your first day ! " said Alfy sharply . " Do n't get discouraged . All right , so you lost . So you 're just starting out . " Alfy clapped the boy on the shoulder . " Doc , this is my kid brother , Joe . He 's just starting out . The Army and the Reeks and Wrecks are hot for his body , but I 'm trying to set him up in business for hisself instead . We 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , we 'll think of something else . " " I used to play it in college , " said Paul apologetically . " I 've had a lot of experience . " " College ! " said Joe , awed , and he smiled and seemed to feel better . " Jesus , no wonder . " He sighed and sat back , depressed again . " But I do n't know , Alfy  --  I 'm about ready to throw in the towel . Let 's face it , I have n't got the brains . " He lined up the matches again , and picked at them , playing a game withp233himself . " I work at it , and I just do n't seem to get any better at it . " " Sure you work ! " said Alfy . " Everybody works at something . Getting out of bed 's work ! Getting food off your plate and into your mouth 's work ! But there 's two kinds of work , kid , work and hard work . If you want to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do hard work . Pick out something impossible and do it , or be a bum the rest of your life . Sure , everybody worked in George Washington 's time , but George Washington worked hard . Everybody worked in Shakespeare 's time , but Shakespeare worked hard . I 'm who I am because I work hard . " " O.K. , O.K. , O.K. , " said Joe . " Me , Alfy , I have n't got the brains , the eye , the push . Maybe I better go down to the Army . " " You can change your name before you do , kid , and do n't bother me again , " said Alfy tensely . " Anybody by the name of Tucci stands on his own two feet . It 's always been that way , and that 's the way it 's always going to be . " " O.K. , " said Joe , coloring . " Awri . So I give it a try for a couple more days . " " O.K. ! " said Alfy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the television set , Paul stayed at his side . " Listen , do you happen to know who Fred Garth is ? " " Garth ? " He laughed . " I did n't at first , but I sure as hell do now . He 's the one that ringbarked the oak . " " No ! " " Yep . And they never even thought of questioning him . He was on the committee that was supposed to do the questioning . " " How 'd they catch him ? " " Gave hisself away . When the tree surgeon got there to patch up the tree , Garth tossed his tools in the drink . " " Alfy ! " said the bartender . " You missed the first number . " Alfy pulled up a bar stool . Paul sat down next to him and engaged the bartender in conversation . Their talk was disjointed , as Alfy kept the man busy twisting the television set 's volume knob . " Ever see Finnerty around ? " said Paul . " The piano player ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " I 'd just like to see him , is all . A friend of mine . " " Lot 's of people 'd like to see Finnerty these days . " " Uh-huh . Where 's he keep himself ? " The bartender looked at him appraisingly . " Nobody sees Finnertythese days . " " Oh ? He 's not living with Lasher any more ? " " Full of questions today , are n't you ? Nobody sees Lasher these days . " " I see . " Paul did n't . " They leave town ? " " Who knows ? Come on , I have n't got all day . What 'll it be ? " " Bourbon and water . " The bartender mixed the drink , set it before Paul , and turned his back . Paul drank the health of his hostile or apathetic companions in the new life he 'd chosen , coughed , smiled , smacked his lips judiciously , trying to determine what was n't quite right about the drink , and fell senseless from the barstool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the autumn evening " From hill and dell , Far rings the story of the glory of Cornell  --  " Doctor Harold Roseberry , PE-oo2 , laid two documents side by side on the naked , waxy expanse of the top of his rosewood desk . The desk , big enough for a helicopter to land on , was a gift from the Cornell alumni , and a silver plate on one corner said so . Justification of the lavish gift was inlaid in precious woods on the desk top : the football scores run up by the Big Red during the past five seasons . The why and wherefore of this object , at least , would leave no questions in the minds of future archaeologists . " From East and West the crashing echoes answering call , " cried the young voices , and Doctor Roseberry found it extremely difficult to concentrate on the two documents before him : ap235memo from the dean of the School of Arts and Sciences , a quaint , antique man in a quaint , antique part of the university ; and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deportment of the team when off the playing field . The memo from the dean said that a Mr. Ewing J. Halyard had arrived in town in order to show the university to the Shah of Bratpuhr , and , incidentally , to make up a seventeen-year-old credit deficiency in physical education . The memo asked that Doctor Roseberry assign one of his staff to the chore of giving Halyard the final physical-education tests the next morning . " Cornell victorious ! The champions of all ! " came the voices . Doctor Roseberry was inclined to react ironically to the last line of the song . " Certainly , victorious last year , four years afore that , " he muttered in his pregnant solitude . But here was another year that might not look so hot inlaid in rosewood . " Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow , " he said wearily . Every coach in the Ivy League was out to knock him down to a PE  --  oo3 again , and two losses would do it . Yale and Penn were loaded . Yale had floated a bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penn had bought Breslaw from Wisconsin for $43,000 . Roseberry groaned . " How the hell long they think a man can play college football ? " he wanted to know . Six years before , Cornell had bought him from Wabash College , and asked him to list his idea of a dream team . Then , by God they 'd bought it for him . " But what the hell they think they bought ? " he asked himself . " Sumpin ' made outa steel and see-ment ? Supposed to last a lifetime , is it ? " They had n't bought him so much as a water boy since , and the average age of the Big Red was now close to thirty-one . " Far above Cayuga 's waters , With its waves of blue , Stands our noble Alma Mater , Glorious to view  --  " came the voices.  | " Certainly it 's glorious , " said Doctor Roseberry . " Who the hell you figure paid for it ? " In its first two years the football team had paid for itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new chemistry building , a heat and power laboratory , a new administration building for the Agricultural Engineering Department , and four new professorial chairs : the Philosophy of Creative Engineering , Creative Engineering History , CreativePublic Relations for Engineers , and Creative Engineering and the Captive Consumer . Roseberry , who was n't expected to pay any attention to the academic side of the university , had nonetheless kept a careful accounting of all these improvements , glorious to view , that had been added since he and his football team had arrived far above Cayuga 's waters . In anticipation of a poor season , he was roughing out in his mind a polemic letter to the alumni , in which the academic expenditures would figure prominently . He had the first line of the letter , following the salutation , " Sportsmen , " already perfected , and enjoyed imagining it writtenout in capitals : " IS THE FOOTBALL BUSINESS AT CORNELL GOING TO BE RUN ON A BUSINESS-LIKE BASIS , OR IS THE BIG RED GOING TO BE BLED WHITE ? " And then the next sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YEARS , NOT ONE CENT HAS BEEN REINVESTED IN THE BUSINESS , NOT ONE CENT LAID ASIDE FOR DEPRECIATION ! " He saw now that the whole thing would have to be in caps . The situation called for a letter with real punch . The telephone rang . " Doctor Roseberry speakin ' . " " This is Buck Young , Doc . Note here says you wanted me to call . " The husky voice was tinged with uneasiness , just as Roseberry had hoped it would be . He could imagine that Buck had sat by the phone with the note in his hand for several minutes before he 'd dialed . Now that Buck had gone this far , Roseberry told himself , he 'd go the rest of the way too . " Yeah , yeah , " said Roseberry , smiling captivatingly . " Bucky boy , how are you ? " " Fine . What 's on your mind ? "  | " Maybe I should ask what 's on yours . " " Thermodynamics . Stress analysis . Fluid flow . Differential equations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why' n't you loosen up and have a beer with me down at The Dutch ? You hear the news I got , I think maybe you 'll get something else on your mind . " " Cheer , cheer , here we are again To cheer with all our might  --  " sang the voices , and Doctor Roseberry waited impatiently for the racket to stop . If they had to have a football rally , he wished they 'd hold it somewhere where it would n't bother him and his team . That was another thing : Cornell was so cheap , they quarteredtheir athletes on the campus rather than setting up a separate establishment away from all the student racket . " Wait 'll they shut up , Bucky boy , and I can hear myself think . " " Cheer , cheer , here we are again , To cheer for the Red and White ! " Either Cornell was going to get progressive , or they could find themselves another coach , Roseberry told himself . Now , Tennessee  --  there was a progressive setup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder Milankowitz went there for $35,000 , after he turned down Chicago for $40,000 . " O.K. , Bucky , I can hear again . What about I meet you down at The Dutch for a couple of quick ones in fifteen minutes ? " The voice was faint , reluctant . " Just for half an hour . " Doctor Roseberry climbed into his black convertible in the team parking lot , and drove over to the Delta Upsilon fraternity house , on whose lawn he 'd first spotted Buck Young playing interfraternity football . There , Young had done things for Delta Upsilon for nothing that any college in the country would have considered a steal at $50,000 a year . That had been last fall , and D.U . had eked out the interfraternityfootball championship with 450 points to their opponents ' six . Young had scored 390 of the points , and had thrown the passes for the other 54 , the remaining touchdown beingp238accounted for by a George Ward , whose name had somehow burned itself into Roseberry 's memory along with all of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had approached him , that he played football for fun , and that he wanted to be an engineer . A year ago , with the Big Red by far the biggest thing in the East , with the Yale and Penn alumni still to mobilizetheir economic resources , Roseberry could afford to be amused by Young 's preference for a career in engineering . Now nothing was amusing , and Roseberry saw Young as his one chance to remain a PE  --  oo2 under the fouled-up Cornell footballeconomics . He would sell a couple of superannuated linemento Harvard , who would buy anything that was cheap , and use the proceeds to buy himself the services of Young at far below their value on the open market . The Dutch , its paneling antiqued by the condensation from breaths of generations of adolescent alcoholics , was packed and noisy , and in almost every hand was the drink fashionable that season , benedictine and Pluto water , with a sprig of mint . Doctor Roseberry was cheered and toasted by the children as he entered . He grinned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What the hell these baby engineers got to do'th me , for chrissakes ? " He pushed his way through the crowd , which claimed him for reasons not at all clear , to a dark corner booth , where Purdy and McCloud , the linemen whom he intended to sell to Harvard , were nursing the one beer a night apiece permitted during training . They were talking quietly , but darkly , and , as Doctor Roseberry approached , they looked up , but did n't smile . " Evenin ' boys , " said Doctor Roseberry , sitting down on the small ledge not occupied by McCloud 's backside , and keeping his eyes on the door through which Buck Young would be coming . They nodded , and went on with their conversation . " No reason , " said McCloud , " why a man ca n't play college ball till he 's forty , if he takes good care of hisself . " McCloud was thirty-six . " Sure , " said Purdy gravely , " a older man 's got a certainp239matoority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Purdy was thirtyseven . " Look at Moskowitz , " said McCloud . " Yup . Forty-three , and still goin ' strong . No reason why he shou' n't keep goin ' until he 's fifty . No reason why most men shou' n't . " " Bet I could go to the Reeks and Wrecks now and put togethera Ivy League championship team out of guys past forty who 're s'posed to be through . " " Planck , " said Purdy . " Poznitsky . " " McCarren , " said McCloud , " Mirro , Mellon . Ai n't that right , Doc ? " McCloud asked Roseberry the question casually . " Yup , guess so . Hope so . Better . Kind of outfit I 've got to work with . " " Urn , " said McCloud . He stared down into his beer , finished it off with a flourish , and looked plaintively at Roseberry . " O.K. if I have one more short one tonight ? " " Sure  --  why the hell not ? " said Roseberry . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distressed at this , and both , on second thought , figured they 'd better keep in good shape for the important Big Red season ahead . Roseberry offered no reply to this clumsy gambit . " Better not hit that stuff too hard , " said a leering student , pointing to the two bottles of beer . " Not if Cornell 's going to go on ruling the Ivy League , you better not , boys . " Purdy glowered at him , and the youngster retreated into the crowd . " One minute , they ask you should go out and bust both arms and legs so 's they can say how tough Cornell is . Then the next minute , they want you should live like a goddam missionary , " said Purdy bitterly . " Like in the Army , " said McCloud . The subject reminded Doctor Roseberry of the letter and the memo he 'd been reading in his office , and he patted his breast pocket to make sure he still had them . " Like in the Army , " said Purdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the best years of your life to some college , and what the hell they do when you 're through ? Toss you right into the Reeks and Wrecks . The hell with you , buddy . "  | " Look at Kisco , " said Purdy . " Died for dear old Rutgers , and his widow 's got what ? " " Nuttin ' ! Nuttin ' but a chenille R she can use as a bathmat , and a government pension . " " Shoulda saved his money ! " said Doctor Roseberry impatiently . " He was makin ' more'n the college president . How come he was so poor ? Whose fault that ? " Purdy and McCloud looked down at their big hands and fidgeted . Both of them , in their prime , had made as much as the late Buddy Kisco , who had actually died for Rutgers . But both were likewise broke  --  forever broke , building flamboyant mansions in Cayuga Heights , buying new cars every six months , dressing expensively . . . . " That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to keep up appearances . Sure , people think a athalete makes plenty , and he do on paper . But people never stop to think he 's allus got ta keep up a expensive front . " Purdy leaned forward in excited agreement . " For who ? " he demanded rhetorically . " For the athalete ? " " For Cornell ! " said McCloud . " Damn right ! " said Purdy , leaning back , satisfied . Buck Young , tall , massive , shy , appeared in the doorway and looked around the room . Doctor Roseberry stood and waved , and left Purdy and McCloud to join him at the door . " Bucky boy ! " " Doc . " Buck seemed somewhat ashamed to be seen with the coach , and looked hopefully at a vacant booth . He was behavingas though he were keeping an appointment with a dope peddler , and , in a way , Doctor Roseberry reflected cheerfully , he was . " Buck , I 'm not going to waste any words , because there is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more days . Maybe it 'll be off tomorrow . It 's all up to the alumni , " he lied . " Uh-huh , " said Buck . " I 'm prepared to offer you thirty thousand , Buck , six hundreda week , all year round , startin ' tomorrow . What do you say ? " Young 's Adam 's apple bobbed . He cleared his throat . " Every week ? " he asked faintly.  | " That 's how much we think of you , boy . Do n't sell yourself short . " " And I could study , too ? You 'd give me time off for classes and study ? " Roseberry frowned . " Well  --  there 's some pretty stiff rulings about that . You ca n't play college football , and go to school . They tried that once , and you know what a silly mess that was . " Buck ran his blunt fingers through his hair . " Golly , I du n no . That 's a lot of money , but my family 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not askin ' it for me , Buck ! Think of your schoolmates . You want them to lose a game this year ? " " No , " he murmured . " Thirty-five grand , Buck . " " Jesus , I  --  " " I have heard every word you 've said , " said a young redheadthickly . He was n't drinking benedictine and Pluto water , but sloshed instead a puddle of whisky and water on the table as he sat down by Buck , facing Doctor Roseberry , uninvited . Beneath his open-necked shirt the red of a Meadows T-shirt showed plainly . " Heard it all , " he said , and he laid his hand on Buck 's shoulder gravely . " Here you are at a crossroads , my boy . You 're lucky . Not many crossroads left for people . Nothingbut one-way streets with cliffs on both sides . " " Who the hell are you ? " said Doctor Roseberry irritably . " Doctor , Doctor , mind you , Edmond L. Harrison of the Ithaca Works . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Let 's get away from this lush , " said Doctor Roseberry . Harrison banged on the table with his fist . " Hear me out ! " He appealed to Buck , whose exit he blocked . " The eminent Doctor Roseberry represents one road , and I the other . I am you , if you continue on your present course , five years from now . " His eyes were half closed , and after the fashion of benign drunks he seemed on the verge of tears , so powerfully was he compelled to love and help others . " If you are good , " he said , " and if you are thoughtful , a , fractured pelvis on the gridiron will pain you less than a life of engineering and management . I ,  |p242In  that life , believe me , the thoughtful , the sensitive , those who can recognize the ridiculous , die a thousand deaths . " Doctor Roseberry leaned back and folded his hands across his flat , hard belly . If he 'd thought of it , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrison was doing for nothing . " How do you mean ? " he asked helpfully . " The best man I knew at the Meadows  --  " " The Meadows ? " said Buck in awe . " The Meadows , " said Harrison , " where the men at the head of the procession of civilization demonstrate in private that they are ten-year-olds at heart , that they have n't the vaguest notion of what they 're doing to the world . " " They 're opening new doors at the head of the procession ! " said Buck hotly , shocked by the blunt , near-sabotage talk , and now fighting it , like the good citizen he was . He 'd learned the resounding phrase about opening doors in a freshman orientationprogram , at which a Doctor Kroner had been the impressivechief speaker . " Slamming doors in everybody 's face , " said Harrison . " That 's what they 're doing . " " Keep your voice down , " warned Doctor Roseberry . " I do n't care , " said Harrison stridently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . They gave Proteus the sack , that 's what they did . " " Proteus has been dead for years , " said Buck , sure Harrison was a fake . " His son , his son , Paul , " said Harrison . " So let me say , my boy , go out and make your money on the gridiron , with blood and sweat and sinew . There 's honor and glory in that  --  a little , anyway  --  and you 'll never hate yourself . But keep the hell away from the head of the procession , where you 'll get it in the neck if you ca n't get a lump in your throat over the ups and downs of a bunch of factories . " He attempted to rise , failed onces made it the next time . " And now , goodbye . " " Where are you going ? " said Doctor Roseberry . " Stick around , stick around . " " Where ? First to shut off that part of the Ithaca works for which I am responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin in the north woods , a shack in the Everglades. "  | " And do what ? " said Buck , baffled . " Do ? " said Harrison . " Do ? That 's just it ; my boy . All of the doors have been closed . There 's nothing to do but to find a womb suitable for an adult , and crawl into it . One without machines would suit me particularly . " " What have you got against machines ? " said Buck . " They 're slaves . " " Well , what the heck , " said Buck . " I mean , they are n't people . They do n't suffer . They do n't mind working . " " No . But they compete with people . " " That 's a pretty good thing , is n't it  --  considering what a sloppy job most people do of anything ? " " Anybody that competes with slaves becomes a slave , " said ' / Harrison thickly , and he left . A dark man , dressed like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benedictine and Pluto water on the bar , studied the faces of Roseberry and Young as though memorizingthem , and followed Harrison out of the building . " Let 's go out in the lobby , where we can talk , " said Roseberry , as a cycle of songs began . " Cheer , cheer , here we are again , " cried the young voices , and Young and Roseberry moved into the lobby . " Well ? " said Doctor Roseberry . " I- " " Doctor Roseberry , I believe ? " Roseberry looked up at the intruder , a sandy-mustached gentleman , in a violet shirt , matching boutonniere , and a gay waistcoatcontrasting with his dark suit . " Yes ? " " My name is Halyard , E. J. , of the State Department . And these gentlemen here are the Shah of Bratpuhr , and his interpreter , Khashdrahr Miasma . We were just leaving for the president 's house , and I happened to spot you . " " Charmed , " said Doctor Roseberry . " Brahous brahouna , bouna saki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed nervously . " Guess we have a little business tomorrow morning , eh " Oh , " said Roseberry , " you 're the one  --  the one for the phys. ed. finals . "  | " Yes , yes indeed . Have n't had a cigarette in two weeks . Will it take long ? " " No , I do n't think so . Fifteen minutes ought to do the trick . " " Oh ? That short a time , eh ? Well , well . " The tennis shoes and shorts he 'd bought that afternoon would n't get much wear in that time . " Oh , ' scuse me , gents , " said Roseberry . " This here 's Buck Young . Student just now . " " Lakki-ti Takaru P " the Shah asked Buck . " Like it here ? ' " translated Khashdrahr . " Yessir . Very much , sir , your highness . " " A lot different from my day , " said Halyard . " By gosh , we had to get up every morning bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather , and sit there and listen to some of the dullest lectures you ever heard of . And , of course , some poor fish would have to get up in front of us and talk every day of the week , and chances are he was n't much of a speaker , and anyway no showman . " " Yes , the professional actors and the television circuits are a big improvement , sir , " said Buck . " And the exams ! " said Halyard . " Pretty cute , you know , punching out the answers , and then finding out right off if you passed or flunked . Boy , believe me , we used to have to write our arms off , and then we 'd have to wait weeks for a prof to grade the exams . And plenty of times they made bad mistakes on the grades . " " Yessir , " said Buck politely . " Well , I 'll see one of your assistants tomorrow , eh ? " said Halyard to Roseberry . " I intend I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well ! I guess that 's an honor , with the season just begin-ning . " " Sure , " said Roseberry . He reached into his breast pocket and produced the letter and the memo . He handed the letter to Halyard . " Here 's something you should ought a read before you come . " " Fine , thanks . " Halyard took it , supposing it was a list of the things he would have to do . He smiled warmly at Rose/berry , who had given every indication that Halyard would be given an exceedingly simple and short series of tests . A mere fifteen minutes , he 'd said . That would do it . Halyard glanced at the letter , and could n't imagine what it was all about at first . It was addressed to the president of Cornell , Doctor Albert Herpers , not to him . Moreover , the date on it indicated that it was five years old . Dear Doctor Herpers : he readI had occasion to see the wearers of the Red and White after the Penn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was ashamed to admit to anyone that I had ever come within fifty miles of Ithaca . I was dining in the Club Cybernetics after the game , when the team , led by this new man , Doctor Roseberry , arrived en masse . . .

In view of this , Doctor Herpers , I feel constrained to point out , as a loyal alumnus , that Doctor Roseberry , in his first year with the Big Red , is off to an extremely poor start . In the brief time of his incumbency , I have no doubt that the shockingly public moral turpitude of the team has made a worse name for what I was once proud to claim as my Alma Mater than a lifetime of gridiron victories can possibly offset . . . . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , failing that , that outraged alumni sell him to some Grade C school forthwith . To this end , I am sending copies of this letter to the Alumni Secretary , to each of the local alumni chapters , to the Trustees , and to the Secretary of Athletics in Washington , D. C.Very truly yours , Doctor Ewing J. **25;6213;TOOLONG WAS a very special day , this Sunday in May  --  not only for Sevilla , the spiritual capital of bullfighting , but for all of the Iberian peninsula and even for many countries in Latin America . People had come from all over Spain and Portugal and many parts of Europe , and what tickets there were left to be scalped by the " revendedores " were going for as high as one hundred and fifty dollars . It was a very special day because Francisco Torres y Nunez , called Pacote , the greatest matador of his generationand considered one of the three greatest bullfighters who ever lived , had been goaded into a last performance after having announced his retirement . For killing two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars , six times the amount of the average matador . But that was not the reason he was fighting , for in his eight years as a senior matador he had made four million dollars , and he had no desire for more money . He had come from his big home in Cordoba with his entourage the day before the fight and was installed in a  |p2suite  at the lavish Hotel Andalucia Palace . The hotel is three hundred yards from the sluggish , tree-lined GuadalquivirRiver and only a few blocks away , hugging the river , is the ancient plaza de toros , La Maestranza . Hours before the fight , people who could not afford a ticket had waited along the boulevard and lingered at the sidewalk cafes to watch him make this last trip to a bull ring , the beginning of the end to an amazing career . At three-fifteen , the first fancy carriages began to clop down the Paseo de las Delicias . Some of the women in them wore mantillas and Manila shawls and the men broadbrimmedglossy Cordobes hats . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign cars belonging to falangistas , carriages belonging to royalty , and people  --  hundreds of people streaming to fill the fifteen thousand seats of the Maestranza . At three-forty-five the big blue station wagon pulled out of the courtyard of the Hotel Andalucia Palace , the canvas cape basket strapped on its top . It forced its way down the swarming boulevard slowly but relentlessly , actually pushing people aside with its front fenders as it did its best to deliver its owner to the place he least wanted to go in the world . An old woman in rags spotted the gaudily uniformed man sitting slumped in the back seat next to his manager , and rapping on the window of the car she called fervently : " God protect you , boy , God protect you ! " He stared back at her with unseeing eyes as the car moved on and his fingers unconsciously went to the scar that notched the left side of his chin . At twenty-nine , his face was sad and drawn and old , yet at the same time itp4was compelling and majestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any part of the world people would immediately ask : Who is this young-old man  --  for he had the look and aura of Number One . Hod carrier , dancer , artist , banker , one might not know  --  only that he was the best in his field . The hundreds of other Sevillanos did n't have to wait to see the familiar profile . Who else in Spain had such a car ? Besides its external splendor , it was built especially for a bed to be made in the back so that the matador could snatch . some sleep while traveling across the country betweenfights ; in his best years he had fought every other day for the entire six months season , sometimes twice on the same day in different towns , and there was little time for rest . At the sight of its blue magnificence wedging through the humanity , men standing at the bar in the bodegas along the river said , " Here he comes , " and hurried to gulp down their cafes con leche or pay up for their ants ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on time . One little man in a beret and dungarees put down his " chata " of beer and stood up on his toes to look over the crowd in front . " Vaya , vaya ! " he murmured . " What a car ! How would you like to have a coach like that ? " His companion , a little drunk , clapped him on the shoulder . " And how would you like to have got it the way he did , eh , old one ? " " Did you see his face ? He looked different . " " How would you look if you were going where he 's going ? " " No , he looked strange . I talked to him only a fewp4hours ago . I talked to him at noon , and he did n't look like that . You do n't believe me ? It was before you arrived . Ask the barman . I talked to Pacote and he talked to me , just like anybody , just like you or me . We had a cognac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . Ask the barman if you do n't believe I talked to him . Oye , barman , come over here and . . . " " We better get going , " the other said . " Or we 'll find someone in our seats . " The big station wagon had already turned off the boulevardat the corner by the monumental stone coliseum that was the Maestranza , and it fought its way through the bulging narrow street that led to the hack of the arena . Unlike most plazas de toros , the back of the Maestranza melts into clusters of houses and bodegas that over the centuries have mushroomed in the damp shade under the stands , around the patio de caballos , and up against the base of the structure . People were hanging out of windows and flowered balconies around the little cobbled square , and they cheered when the car pulled up in front of the entrance . The driver sprang out and hurried around to open the rear door . The thin broad-shouldered man in the glistening gold and white " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouts became louder . " Ole tu inadre ! " called a man from the balcony of one of the houses built up against the plaza . This would be all he 'd see of the show , for the cheapest ticket would have cost him the equivalent of his family 's food for a month . But he would hear the tormenting sounds from the arena excitement all afternoon and he would imagine what wasp5happening and curse his poverty . But now he made the most of this one moment . He brandished his hand in front of him for emphasis and shouted , " Ole Don Paco , ole gran maestro ! " The gaunt figure stood by the car uncertainly for a few moments , his melancholy eyes blinking at the people massed around him , his face greenish-white under the black , knobbed hat . The little bald , fat man bustled out of the car , and he and another bullfighter elbowed through the crowd to convoy the matador up to the big gate . He winced under the masculine pats on his back and shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he jerked it away . The small door cut out in the big gate creaked open mud the men stepped in . The matador tripped on the sill , but the fat man caught him , and the door was slammed . Inside the courtyard were the photographers , ten of them , and the men from the No-Do , the official newsreel , who started grinding their old-fashioned camera . " There 's nothing to photograph yet , " the little fat man growled . " Save your film . " The photographers snapped pictures as the matadorwalked toward the gate that led to the patio de caballos . But then , as they passed the latrine , a roofless , doorless cement structure , the matador hesitated , turned , and went in . A photographer started to follow , but the little fat man hatted the camera out of his hands and blocked the doorway . " Ca n't you even leave the man alone for this ? " he said , his bald head as red with anger as his face . " A man ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his camera from the ground , looked to see that the lens was n't broken , and said abusedly : " Carat ' , Pepe , you know me  --  Santana from the A.B.C . I was n't going in there to take any pictures . " Another photographer in back said out of the corner of his mouth : " The gentle , bald Pepe is acting very strange today . " " Not as strange as Pacote , " said the man next to him . " I do n't know what 's wrong , but something is . I hope I 've got enough film . I think we 're going to need it today . " Pacote Torres stood before the trough inside the latrine . He was swaying slightly . " Jesus , Jesus , " he mumbled . The nostrils of his aquiline nose flared as his water revived the stench of thousands of urinations before him . What a day . Good Christ , what a day this had been . And what a day it was going to be . It had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than any of the others.  |p7THE  FIRST SOUND he heard that day  --  the day that was to be the most terrible and most glorious of his life  --  was a shotgun going off . It woke him up with its pumff . Then a pause and pumff again . Probably missed it , Pacote thought sleepily , with that long pause between shots . He wished he had nothing more on his mind today than going out to the tiro de pichon . Not that he liked killing the pigeons . As a matter of fact he hated it . The Duke of Pinohermoso had taken him out once and insisted that he try it . Pacote was a rotten shot , having tried it only a few times before in his life , but he could n't miss after yelling " Pajaro " and the box trap was sprung and the bird did n't even have time to get its wings open before pellets ripped it into a puff of feathers . He 'd put down the gun and did n't shoot again , and they 'd all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But still , killing pigeons would be nice today  --  instead . Anything would be nice , instead . A ride around the hills in back of his ranch in Cordoba would be the pleasantestp8of all . He was a rotten rider , too , but it would be good . Especially with someone who did n't ask him questions about bulls . Socorro maybe . It would be nice with her . He let himself doze on this for a while , but in his state of half awakeness he got stuck like a cracked record on one scene : he could n't make the bit stay in the horse 's mouth . He would get it in , fix the chin strap , and then just as he was about to get on the horse , he would find himself putting the bit in the horse 's mouth again . It went on and on and was so frustrating and exhausting that he made himselfwake up . He flung the covers from him . Then he slowly propped his skinny frame up and sat on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . Now that he was fully awake he knew his hands would be trembling when he took them from his face . Yes , it was really there inside him , as big as an ostrich egg . The fear organ was right there just below the V of his rib cage , below his heart , a great hunk of fear . It was as real as any other organ in his torso . It was n't the dull ache of the usual fear : this was a sharp pain of fear , unlike any other he 'd ever known . Well , I 've a right to it , he told himself . A great big right . He reached out and absently patted the little gray dog sleeping at the end of his bed . It raised its head to acknowledge the salutation and then dropped the mustached muzzle on its forepaws again . It had a pair of surprised and plaintiveblack eyebrows that always made it look as though it had just backed into a hot radiator , and it smelled of old age.  | " Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionately . To show he 'd heard , the dog gave a token wag of its tail , like a slowed-down metronome , but he did n't open his eyes . Pacote looked at his watch , the watch his mother had given him the day of la alternativa , the watch that had engravedon the back : " My son , do not worry , do not be afraid . " It was past eleven . Slept ten hours and still exhausted . They 'll be here soon . It would be better , in a way , when they got here . It was always bad in the morningbecause that was when you were you . Later it was better because you became somebody else and something else . Then for a moment he had a great idea , an idea that made him warm inside and dulled the fear pain : get dressed in a hurry , take the Buick out of the garage , drive to Cadiz , and hop the Marques de Comillas bound for Southp10America . It was nice to think about for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peruvian girl whose face was blurred but vaguely like Socorro 's , only fine and decent . Then he gave a grunting mirthless laugh at himself to make him come back to today , now , this minute , reality . It 's true , he said . You are through , you 're finished , your nerves are shot . You need a drink . He looked across the big hotel suite at the bottle on the dresser . He 'd almost killed it last night , but there was a little left . It made him sick to think of it with the hangover fuzz in his mouth , but it would feel good once it was down . God bless los Yanquis . They could make whiskey . To hell with Spanish wines . He started to go for it . Then he said : You fool . You 've really turned into a cowardly fool . Drink on the day of a fight  --  a fight like this one ? That 's what Nino de Ronda used to do and look where it got him . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last fight and get a nice high colonic from a horn . If you were fool enough to get into this thing , you ought to have brains enough to do it right . He snapped the switch of the little radio on the bedside table . " This is Radio Andorra , " said a reedy female voice " presenting for your  --  " He twisted the dial and the B.B.C. from Gibraltar had time to say : " In the two years which the Labor Government has  --  " before he sped on to another station and the martial strains of " La Morena de Mi Copla . " The music faded and a voice boomed , " Toros in Sevilla ! Today everyone is  --  " He snapped the radio off.  |p11The  door opened and a white-faced middle-aged man came in . It was Matagatos , his cousin and peon de confianza - his number one banderillero . He was carrying a lot of cheap paper fans and a photo and a dozen telegrams and cables . " Buenos Bias , Pacorro , " he said , forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway up . The Andaluz sun was blinding . " Hola , " Pacote grunted , shading his dark eyes . " Hola , Catkiller . Has Chaves picked up a third banderillero ? " " I do n't know . I have n't seen him yet this morning . I just got up . " " A ver , " he said taking the telegrams . " Let 's see . " They were blue and not in envelopes but just folded and pasted . I Ie ripped through them , not reading their platitudes but just glancing at the signature , looking for hers . There was none from her , and he threw them aside . Matagatos handed him the fans , a pen , and a telephone book to write on . Pacote opened the first fan . A slip of paper clipped to it said : " Please dedicate to Juanita Perez , a great admirer . " There were some pictures printed on the fan of Pacote in action , and on each side was his sad-faced portrait under which was written simply " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong face , an ascetic face , a face El Greco would have enjoyed painting . The prominent nose was aquiline , and the heavy-lidded eyes gave an aristocratic mien . It was a scarred face that might easily emerge as ugly in a photograph , and when analyzed in a mirror it distressed the owner . But it was not ugly . It was a fine face . He wrote on the fan in his careful , elaborate hand , thep12hand of one to whom writing was an unaccustomed task : " To my friend Senorita Juanita Perez , excellent aficionada , from her servant , Francisco Torres y Nunez " Pacote . " Now what the devil would she do with his precious signature ? Ordinarily he hated this business , but now it was diverting ; it took his mind off : Today , today , today ! " Here 's another , " said Matagatos . To an unknown person named Luis Morales he wrote on the photo , forming the words with his lips as he wrote : " To my good friend and companion ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would hang up the picture there and tell his customers he was an intimate friend of The Number One . Maybe the picture would be worth money , if he were killed today . " Last photo ever signed by him , " the man would boast happily as he ... If he were killed today ! He shoved the fans away . " I ' 11 finish these later , " he said in his deep Cordovan accent . He folded his hands tightly together so that Matagatos would not see them tremble . He could hear heavy breathing out in the hall and then the door of the suite opened and his manager waddled in . Jose " Pepe " Chaves was little and fat with big dark glasses and a black toupee that was always askew and generally cocked over one eye ; it was treated more as a beret than a wig , and sometimes it went into his breast pocket as a kind of hairy handkerchief . He had the Sunday newspapers under one arm and he dumped them on the bed and sank into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he puffed . His rough face had an unfinished look about it , as though it had been made by a series of angry punches at a chunk of red putty . But there was a gentleness in the face , a sort of rough gentleness . " Hotter than the sea . " As to all Andaluces , the sea to Pepe was a variable commodity used to make any statement more emphatic . " Hola , Matagatos . " He slid the toupee off his head and fanned himself . " See what your friends in the newspapers say , Paco ? I hope they develop sores on their feet and be made to carry the mail . " Pacote dragged over a paper to him and began to read it , his hand propping up his chin . The front page had a pictureof him and one of Tano side by side . He was a smooth , smug twenty-year-old . How ugly my picture is next to that young bastard , Pacote thought . He began to read aloud : " Sevilla and people from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duels since the Joselito-Belmonte rivalry thirty years ago , " it said underneath Julio Salazar 's byline , " when the great Pacote  --  called the Monstrous One because of his prowess and ability to charge fantastic prices !  --  " Sweet little termites , are n't they ? " Chaves grunted. . . . " fights what he claims is his last fight with the sensational newcomer Tano Ruiz . Upon returning from his highly successful Mexican and South American campaignslast month , Pacote , aged twenty-nine , announced that he was cutting the pigtail and retiring to his Cordoba estate to raise bulls for others to fight . However , since he has not fought on Spanish soil for some ten months , hep14has decided to have the last corrida of his life in his belovedAndalucia , those sonsofbitches " . . . he kept reading as though this interjection were part of the text . . . " it is also said that his decision was prompted by the fact that he wished to prove to fans of young Ruiz once and for all that the Old Maestro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art of tauromaquia that people will never forget . Everyone knows of the now famous incident between them at a certain Madrid restaurant , and that there is no gran amor between them , and .. . " Mierda ! " Pacote exclaimed , shoving the paper away and standing up . " What are they trying to do to me ? I told them I was not going to do anything today  --  told them I was going to coast ! They said they 'd take it easy on me . They ca n't expect me to commit suicide on the last one . I would n't have taken the fight if I did n't think everyone knew it was just a farewell exhibition . " " They did n't have to build up all this hay about the rivalry . " Chaves flung his toupee on the floor disgustedly . " The paper at the box office is all sold anyway . People want to see your last fight , just to say they saw it . " " And that beloved Andalucia stuff , " said Pacote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pesetas , and that 's all . " Neither one wanted to mention the newspaper 's reference to the cafe incident , the real reason he was fighting today . " Hui , that dog stinks , " said Chaves . " So do you , " said Pacote . " You should have him put away . "  | " We should have you put away . " Chaves took out a cigar . " I think I can get Cantimplas for a third this afternoon . " There was a timid knock on the loor . " Adelante , " snapped Pacote . " Come in . " A bald , shabbily dressed little man came . " Buenos dias , senores , " he said . It was Cayetano Montoya , " Nino de Ronda , " once called " the perfect matador . " What in Christ 's name does he want , Pacote thought . That 's me in fifteen years , if I were n't getting out . Bald as a chamberpot , bags under the eyes like wineskins , eyes as bleary as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once beautiful build now sagged into round-shoulderednessand a pot belly . He remembered the book by the American where Cayetano  --  only the author called him Pedro Romero  --  went off with the English lady . WavyhairedCayetano was nineteen , top man in all Spain , and as the writer had said  --  " the best-looking boy I have ever seen . " Well , he must have had just a few too many Englishladies , or something ; at forty-five he looked sixty . " Matador , " Cayetano began humbly , looking at the floor and rubbing one hand over his shiny head . There was not even any fringe at the base  --  it looked as though there 'd never been any hair on that head at all , and that he had eyebrows seemed surprising . " I hear you are short a banlerillerotoday . I happen not to be engaged today , and Iwas wondering . . . The classic prototype of the old bullfighter . Christ 's sake , did he have to come around today of all days top16illustrate what a lousy business this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged " for a long time . He had n't fought as a matador for fifteen years , except in small-town festivals . He had put the sticks in a few times for his son who was a second-rate novillero , but the son 's manager had thought it too big a risk to have a drinking banderillero , so his son fired him . Pacote shook his head . " You heard wrong , man . We 're all squared away for today . " They did need another peon , and he would have liked to have helped el pobre , but it was too dangerous . All right to have somebody like Cayetano around when you were fighting calves at a festival , but if someone made a mistake with these bulls there 'd be blood spattered all over the sand . " I really need  --  I mean , I think if I had one fight in a good cuadrilla I might sort of , you know , get back on my feet . " He frowned earnestly , trying to give more convictionto his mumbled words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comeback even as a matador , you know ! " Pacote answered brusquely so as to end this conversationas mercifully as possible . " No , I 'm sorry , man . " " I 'm a good man with the sticks , Paco , you know how they used to call me . " " No , " said Pacote . " I 'm sorry . " Cayetano nodded , as though he 'd never really expected the job and did n't blame Pacote for refusing . He looked around the ornate room . His bloodshot eyes studied the things on the desk as intently as though they were in a museum showcase . There was the old framed photo ofp17Pacote 's mother and father standing uncomfortably in front of a painted pastoral backdrop . On the other end of the desk was the photo of Pacote and Socorro taken at the Stork Club when they had stopped in New York for a week on the way back from Mexico . There was the wallet with all the bull brands mounted on it in gold  --  a present from General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the La Prensa corrida to him . There was the doll , a little spangled bullfighter with a fairly accurate caricature of Pacote 's sad face , and the cigarette case made from a bull 's cojones  --  you could tell because there was no seam in the two parts that slid together . He started to go . Then he saw Chaves 's wig on the floor . l le stooped down and picked it up . " Y eso ? " he mumbled stupidly . " And this ? " " Una peluca , " said Chaves with a gentle grin . " Put it on  --  you need it worse than me . " Cayetano looked at it dully as he turned it over in his hands . Then he stood in front of the full-length mirror on the closet door . With his pudgy fingers he put the wig on his head very solemnly . It made him look funny , but it took twenty years off him . A silence came over the room as he stared transfixed at his reflection . He was unconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulders and sucked in his stomach . He raised his head to make his double chin disappear . His eyes narrowed , and his mouth eased into the arrogant sneer that a matador affects when going out to meet the bull . His right arm came forwardslightly as though holding a muleta and a sword . Itp18was n't hard to imagine him striding out into the arena in Madrid the day of his presentation , handsome and lithe , and with thirty thousand people screaming how they loved him . He looked at one profile , and then the other . He was lost in another generation for a few minutes . Then reluctantlyhe took the wig off and put it on the dresser . The sag came back in his body , the stoop in his shoulders , and without saying anything , he shuffled out the door . The men remained uncomfortably silent . Then Pacote sighed and said " Ai ! " between clenched teeth and went to the telephone . " Oiga , conserje , " he said . " Nino de Ronda will be just going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do need a man today . Have him be at the plaza at ten minutes to four . And sober . " He hung up and avoided looking at Chaves . " You 're a fool , " said Chaves , as though stating a longacceptedfact.  |p19MATAGATOS  glanced at his watch and stood up . " Well , I 'd better get over to the sorteo . " " Wait till I get dressed , " said Pacote . " I 'm coming too . " " To the sorteo ? " Chaves exclaimed . " You 've never done that , " Matagatos said , almost critically . " I want to take a look at them today . " Pacote stripped off his pajamas . A jagged scar ran across the top of his bony chest , a chest that was broad but tubercular-thin . " Going to draw them myself today . For luck . " " Might be for bad luck , Paco . You 've never drawn for yourself . " " No , it 'll be for good luck today . " He pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this luck business . He knew that Chaves knew that he could n't stand not seeing what was going to try to kill him in the last fight of his life . . He went into the big tiled bathroom , before putting on his shirt , and brushed his teeth.  | " I forgot to tell you , " Chaves called to him . " There 's a toothpaste out called Crema de Dientes Pacote . ' Did n't even ask our permission . We could sue them . " Pacote washed his face and ran his hand over the slight bluish-green stubble that was only on his upper lip and the right side of his chin . It did n't grow around the twoinchscar that notched the left side . It was Belmonte , el gran Juan , who said that the beard grew more on the day of a corrida , that Fear made it grow more . He looked at his hands . I ' 11 wait and shave later , he thought . I 'll be steadier after I see the cattle . Besides , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible for this last one . Best to be as little ugly as possible today . " It 's red , too , " Chaves said . " Can you imagine brushing your teeth with red stuff ? You 'd think you were spitting blood all the time . " God , you are ugly , Pacote thought as he looked in the mirror and combed his hair . Uglier than the sea . A gray  --  almost white  --  streak went down the middle of it . There was no gray on the sides , but down the middle was the streak that looked like a misplaced highlight . It had only started to appear a couple of years ago , and it was getting whiter all the time . " I could find out the name of the company that makes that stuff , " Chaves said as Pacote came out of the bathroomand put on his shirt . " We ought to get a percentage at least , same way we do on Ani Pacote . Except nobody 's going to buy red toothpaste . Who wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p21Matagatos  picked up the phone . " I 'll get el Buick . " He pronounced it " bweek . " " We 'll walk , " said Pacote . " It 's only a few blocks . " " You do n't want to get tired , chico , " said Chaves . It occurred to him to scratch his groin . " I was born tired , " Pacote said . " Compadre better stay here , " said Matagatos . " He 'll hark at the cattle . " " No , he wo n't , " said Pacote . He was feeling better now . Calmer . " Ven , Compadre ! " The old dog jumped stiffly off the bed and followed them condescendingly . As they went out the door Pacote grabbed the wig and plopped it backwards on Chaves 's shiny dome . " Que lindo eres , " he said . " How beautiful you are . And so well dressed . " Scabs of food on the lapels and archipelagosof grease spots always graced Chaves 's sport coats . " Son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused electricity restrictions , and the elevatordid n't work until one , so the three men walked down the heavily carpeted stairs . When they came into the tiled lobby two people  --  obviously Americans  --  were talking to the conserje . " Perdon , Matador , " said the conserje , coming out from behind the counter . " But this journalist would like to meet you . He is with a big American magazine . He says he 's going to do an article on you . " He brought them over . The man , thirty and handsome in a crew-cut eager , undergraduate sort of way , advanced . " My name 's New-t on , Senor Pacote . " They shook hands . " And this is myp22wife , Helen . " He nodded pleasantly at Chaves and Matagatos . He had a good smile , in spite of the fact that two of his front teeth almost crossed over each other . The woman wore a mink stole over her black dress , a little mink hat perched on her dark upswept hair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type of society woman that could be easily induced to lend her name and face to a cold-cream advertisement . " I wonder if I could get a couple . " Newton held up the Leica that hung from a strap around his neck . " Ah , una foto , " Pacote said aloofly but politely . Here was the audience . He slipped into the part of the tranquil , fearless matador , and the feigned calm brought him genuine calm . " You are aficionados ? " " Si , mucho , " said the man . " Muy aficionados . We came down here from Paris especially for the fight today . I 'm doing an article on it for my magazine . Helen here is crazy about the sport , worse than I am . " He tapped his head with a forefinger . " Un poquito loca en el coco por los toros . " " It 's the greatest thing in the world , " the woman said , with fierce sincerity . Like her husband , she spoke fluent Spanish . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the man . " You and Silverio . Paid fifty dollars for rotten seats but glad to get them . It was the most tremendous emotional experience I ever had in my life , and I 've been wanting to do an article on you ever since . I did n't even know anything about it then . It was my second fight and 1 didn'tp23know anything  --  still thought the bulls charged because the cape was red . " " No , " said Pacote . " You 're right , they 're color-blind . " Chaves held his wrist up and tapped the watch . " I must go , " Pacote began , " We . . . " " Oh no , please , " said Newton . " The photo . Outside . " They went out into the bright sun of the driveway in front of the hotel . Newton walked ahead and turned around peering through the camera . Pacote stood there , a little ill at ease , as Newton held the light meter on him . A man going by with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chaves and Matagatos stepped aside out of range of the camera , and the little dog followed them . " I 'm hardly the autograph-hound type , " said the woman with a self-deprecating laugh , " and I 've never done anything like this before , but would you mind if I stood with you in the photo ? " " Encantado , " said Pacote . " Charmed . " Newton took three pictures . " Would you mind smiling , senor ? " A hint of a shy smile hovered in one corner of Pacote 's mouth . " On fight days I 'm too scared to smile . " " Please smile , " coaxed the woman . " A bigger smile . " Pacote , mouth widened a little , cautiously , like a woman afraid to crack her mudpack , and Newton took the picture . Then they shook hands and said good-bye . " Lots of luck , " said Newton . " We 're going to see a great day today . Something we 'll tell our grandchildren about . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his calm suddenly left him . " We 'll do what we can . " He snapped his fingers for the dog . " Come on , Compadre . " " Good luck , " Newton called after them . " I 'd like to talk to you later about an interview . " " That , " breathed Helen Newton , as she watched Pacote stride out of sight , " is the most attractive man in the world . "  |p25THE  THREE MEN were down by the river now , walkingpast the round , squat Tower of Gold where Columbus stored his treasures after a voyage . " We can just bury that hay , Paco . " " What hay ? " " That hay about I do n't know , we 'll do what we can . You 're going to coast this afternoon . Nobody 'll blame you . Do n't get any ideas about giving those Yanquis and all the rest of the blood-drinking goats one last great afternoon . You 've given them a hundred other great afternoons they can damn well remember . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Pacote . " Coast all the way . " " Well , do n't forget it after you get in the ring . Tano is going w be out to commit suicide to make you look bad . Do n't lose your head . Let him cut cars if he wants to . You just get out whole . We 'll have a good party afterward . I lave all the newspapermen over and cut the pigtail . It 'll be a great party . " " I 'm not going to lose my head . "  |p26In  front of one of the little open bodega bars was one of the huge posters advertising the fight , and Pacote 's heart skipped a little as he saw it . It was always terrifying to see it in big print , something so irrevocable about it when the posters were actually up . " The taurine event of the decade , " the words shouted ; " 4 toros bravos de Miura 4 . " Then came his name and Tano 's in letters five inches high . Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In hot yellows and reds it depicted a life-size Pacote executing a muletazo , the bull charging straight out at the viewer . " I 've always liked that one , " said Chaves . " I 'd like it better if it had your name underneath , " said Pacote . A man in a beret and dungarees standing at the bar in front of great barrels of manzanilla spotted him . " Pacote ! " he exclaimed . He came out proffering a large glass of cognac and some red crayfish on a tray . " Don Paco , do me the honor of taking a copitiya . " " Conac , no  --  muchas gracias , " Pacote said hesitantly to his urgings . But God , how he wanted the liquor . " I will take a cigala , though . " He wanted ten glasses of cognac like that one . He needed a great bowl of it . " We must find a female , matador . " He ran his finger down the underside of the crayfishes ' tails : " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more tender . " Pacote suddenly reached out to the tray and took the glass of cognac . " I think I will have ... " " No , Paco , " Chaves ordered sternly . " One 's not going to hurt me , " snapped Pacote , and hep27threw the amber liquid down his throat in two gulps . Then he took a crayfish , murmuring , " Very grateful . " " Ni na ni na ni na ! " said the man . " After all the emotionyou 've given me in your day , I should give you a millioncigalas and a reservoir of conac . And we will all be there in the first row of the sun-and-shade section to ovationyou this afternoon . " Pacote said good-bye and moved on . He husked off the shell of the crayfish as he walked and put the white meat in his mouth absently . In your day , his brain kept saying , in your day ! He tossed the claws and the head of the cigala into the gutter . God , what a feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . But the cognac felt good in his stomach and loosened the fear knot a little . If only he had another glass , another big glass of friendly , burning cognac like that one ! Just one or two more and t lien he would n't be afraid of anything ! But that was suicide . They walked along by the river and the warm air was good in the lungs , in spite of the fruity smells that came off the sluggish water . Across there was Triana , the gypsy quarter , a colony of dirty houses in narrow streets where baskets and pottery were made , and sad songs were wailed and where the young gitanos sneaked out to the ranches to light the bulls by moonlight and dreamed of someday beingThe Best , like Pacote Torres . A fancy wagon came toward them , pulled by four perfectlymatched mules with gay headresses wagging and pompons on the harness bouncing . A coachman in a broad-brimmed hat and the short jacket of the Andaluzp28costume sat on the box , but a handsome mustached man in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Eduardo , " said Matagatos . He pulled up the reins in his gloved hands and greeted them cheerily . " Hola , " said Pacote . Eduardo was all right . He did n't know much about the business his great-grandfather had founded , but he was a good type . " We 'll see a great day , Paco , " Eduardo said , " I 've sent the four best on the ranch . All good . Brought them in from Tablada early this morning . Go take a look at them . Lots of luck . " He waved and drove on . Christ , how can anyone be cheery today , Pacote thought . And then his mind flashed back to in your day ! " Good ! " exclaimed Matagatos . " No such thing as a good Miura . " " Eduardo sure as hell better have sent a good corrida , " said Chaves. " 1 still think we should have gone to the ranch and picked them ourselves . Only way you can be sure they 're going to be like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dane height  --  " and like this "  --  he made a pair of turned-in horns out of his thumb and forefinger . " Modernbullfighting , my friend , is based on the principle of the big bill in the wallet and the little bull in the arena . " " And have Tano saying I would n't have fought unless I had goats ? This last one has to be done right , chico , you know that . He 's always said I was afraid of Miuras . Sure , I 'm afraid of anything with horns . I do n't even like snails . " They came to the ring , the Macstranza , the beautiful Maestranza , second oldest plaza de toros in Spain . Thep29great stone pillars and the majestic arch of the threatening coliseum had glowered out at the river like this for two centuries . How still and cruel it seemed now , an empty shell of cruelty , stark and stripped of the screaming people and the brass band . How many men like me , thought Pacote , how many cowards like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and felt their guts contract with fear at the nakedness of the arena and the nakedness inside their bodies ? Maybe there were one or two in the two hundred years who were as afraid . Surely there must have been one as afraid . Ile saw a man plastering a big poster on the side of the ring announcing the novillada of next Sunday . All new kids . Well , today could be worse , Pacotc thought . It could be the beginning instead of the end . They turned down the side street to where the high corral wall jutted out from the plaza . There were a lot of urchins hanging around a large wooden door and several beggars and a gypsy shoeshine man . Chaves banged on it twice . It opened cautiously first and then all the way when the gatekeeper saw who it was . They stepped in the little sunny patio , where several men were gathered in knots smoking and talking . They were banderilleros , picadors , cx-bullfighters , promoters , newspapermen , gentlemen aficionados. , and hangers-on . They stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod or a wave from The Best. he foreman in charge of the bulls came up to them . He was dressed in the big-brimmed Cordobes hat and the short bolero jacket of the Andaluz rancher.  | " Hola , Matador , " he said in his friendly , respectful Andaluzaccent . " You are drawing them yourself , I see . Tano 's man is up there already . The dog wo n't bark at the cattle , will he ? " " No . He 's a good dog . " They went up the stone steps to the top of the corral . The walls were wide and an iron railing ran around on both sides . Several men were up there looking down at the bulls , talking softly and occasionally pointing at one or another of the animals . One of them was Tano 's banderillero . A large faded sign stenciled on the corral wall warned : " It is strictly prohibited to talk at the cattle or molest them . " Pacote knew everyone was watching him , and he did n't want them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't look down . He made himself walk over to Tano 's man first . " Buenos dias , " he said . " Buenos dias , " said the banderillero a little coldly . " What do you think of the oxen ? " " I have n't seen them yet , " Pacote replied casually . Then he turned slowly and looked down in the corral . It was a relief to see them , for the unknown was worse than reality no matter how bad . His eyes skipped from one to the other of the animals milling quietly together , taking them all in quickly , and then going back to study them individually . All four of them were solid black , fairly uniformof horn and not too big . They never looked big from up above , but God , how they grew when you found yourselfon their level in the ring !  |p31He  turned to Chaves . " Pepe " he asked , and he awaited the answer tensely , for no one in the world knew so much about bulls as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tell how a bull would fight just by watching it awhile in the corrals , how many times it would charge the Dies , and whether it would fight a brave or defensive fight . Pacote knew that Pepe Chaves could have become the greatest bullfighter who had ever lived ; at twenty he had had the build and knew so much about bulls that they said he could talk bull language . But he was a coward . He could n't keep his feet from dancing away from the horns no matter how hard he tried , so he " cut the pigtail , " and took to managing men who were braver than he . Chaves did n't answer . He took off his dark glasses and studied the animals carefully . Then he pulled the corners of his mouth down exaggeratedly and wagged one hand , thumb extended , like an airplane signaling . So-so . He put his glasses back on . " They look very even to me , " said Pacote , trying to keep the anxiety out of his voice . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make the bulls better by wheedling Pepe into saying they were good . " Regular , " said Pepe . He always scratched the back of his left hand with his right fingers when he was concentratinghard , " Neither foo nor fa . But they 're all right . " And Pacote knew him well enough to know he meant it , that he was n't just trying to make him feel good . Pepe was usually a bit on the pessimistic side , too . He began to feel a little more confidence seeing the bulls now and hearing Chaves say that they were all right . The fear organ wasp32still there big in his chest , but it was n't strangling him . It was good to see the animals . When you just stayed in your hotel room you imagined them as strange monsters , not really bulls , but weird , black-bloody shapes , that could blur and become unicorns or dinosaurs . It was good to see that they were just bulls , bulls like the hundreds of others he had killed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed all the others , the one thousand and three others . Before , it was the beginning and the drive of young , hot ambition . And then it was the middle part with confidence and the surety that you were The Best . But now it was the end , and there was doubt and fear , and thep33timing was going fast like a handful of water dribbling out of the cupped palms through the fingers . " Let 's get them paired off , " Tano 's banderillero was saying . Two of the bulls were clearly " better " than the others . F hey were the smallest , and their horns turned in a little , hut not too much . And one of these was better , smaller and prettier , with " a comfortable head . " A real " nun . " Tano 's banderillero wrote the numbers of the big scraggly white brands on their sides on two separate pieces of cigarette paper . Chaves clapped his hands together twice , grunting ,  | " Huh , toro ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressively . Number one hundred and twenty stepped back , dropping his head very low and pawingthe earth . Chaves began to whistle softly to himself some urgent , nameless tune . He did n't purse his lips ; his mouth merely assumed a strangely prissy look and the air came out from no visible opening . Finally he said : " Number one-twenty looks a little manso to me . " Manso means tame , and a tame bull is a cowardly and dangerous one . " Course , you ca n't tell till he gets in the ring , but I have that feeling . " " All right , " said Tano 's banderillero unquestioningly ; Chaves 's hunches were famous . " We 'll put him here "  --  he wrote the number on one paper  --  " and the bigger one with the spread we 'll put here . The nun goes with one-twenty . " The papers were crumpled up and dropped into the broad-brimmed hat of the foreman . Pacote gave a suggestion of a bow and extended his hand in a you-first gesture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grudgingly . Pacote reached in , felt a paper , and drew it halfway out . Then he dropped it , and took the other one and unfolded it . He had not drawn 120 . Maybe today would be a lucky day after all . He showed the paper to Pepe . " I 'm glad neither of us is fighting the sobrero , " said the banderillero . He jerked his thumb toward the other corral . Pacote and Chaves walked along the wall and looked down . The bull was alone . It was a substitute bull , in case one of the others broke a horn or would n't charge the horses or was blind in one eye or limped . It looked up at them and pawed the dust.  | " That is a bull ? " snorted Chaves . " They have crossed an elephant with a gnu . " The animal was a pinto , black and white , with uneven and twisted horns . It was gigantic . " What an uncle . If you ever got hooked on the right corkscrewyou 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And his name is Pocapena , " said Tano 's banderillero with a laugh . " Senor Not-Much-Trouble . Like the one that made cold cuts of Granero in Madrid . " " I 'm glad today 's my last , " said Pacote . " With my luck , I would draw that cathedral as a regular in some other fight . " " They arranged the order that the bulls would be fought . Then they shook hands with several people and left . As they went out the big door , a black Fiat pulled up and a chauffeur emerged to open the rear door . Out stepped a little mushroom of a man in a brown felt hat with the brim turned down all the way around . It was Juan Belmonte , he father of modern bullfighting and brother of Manolo elmonte , " empresario " of the Maestranza.  | " HO-la ! " Belmonte exclaimed with his big jaw out and a chuckle in his voice . " Look who we have here . " " Don Juan , " Pacote said and they shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the " Don " in ront of Belmonte 's name  --  even his contemporaries and Ider matadors like El Gallo who knew him intimately . here was nothing about him that demanded respect ; he as just automatically accorded it . " Matador , are you acquainted with this ball of suet at our left ? " Belmonte said , holding Pacote 's hand in both f his and pretending to ignore Chaves . " I had n't heard he 'd been released from the penitentiary . " " They 've released him in my custody , " said Pacote. ut I have to guarantee that he does n't molest pregnant omen and does n't throw any more bottles in church . " " Osu , que miedo ! " said Belmonte , shaking his head . Jesus , what fear ! An unenviable task . " Chaves grunted with pleasure and shook hands with Belmonte.  | " How goes the cattle , Pepe ? " Belmonte asked . As he talked he ran his finger over the vague hint of a mustache on his upper lip . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustache every Lenten period , and he had n't got around to shaving it off this year . Chaves wagged his hand again . " Regular . Not bad . " " They had better be not bad , or we 'll put young Senor Miura in an iron maiden , eh ? A real Inquisition , eh ? " This could be me someday , Pacote was thinking , as he 'd thought so many times before . Belmonte was the exception , he was the opposite of Nino de Ronda . Long since retired , he was around to enjoy the immortality that he had sweated and shed so much blood to obtain . Here was the man who , because of his imagination and skill and guts and physical limitations , had changed bullfighting from the brute act of butchering a bull into a beautiful science . And , yet here he was still alive , proof that it could be done . It was good to see him , the proof , at this moment . The other man who had n't been content with mere greatness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man of whom they said there was no heifer who could drop the bull that could kill him , had his charmed life ripped out of him in 1920 , when he was only twenty-four , by a scrawny , treacherous substitute bull in Talavera de la Reina . Now he lay on the other side of Sevilla under a huge tomb depictingnineteen life-size figures bearing his coffin , and every May 16 , ceremonies were held at his grave and the newspapers published pictures of him and famous poets wrote dirges and odes to him and there were statues of him in wax museums . That 's what they 'd do with Pacote if hep39were to get it ; immortalize him . But to hell with the nothingness of that kind of immortality ! He wanted all of whatBelmonte had  --  the health , respect , intelligent friends , the sum of the large estate , the fine ranch that sent out at least six corridas and two novilladas a season , the wife , the sons and daughters , the grandchildren . But he did n't want his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He should be a .. . " Matador ? " Belmonte was offering him a pencil-thin cigar . Pacote did n't like cigars , but he took it ; it was good , it was luck , to receive something from Belmonte now . He lit it eagerly , as though in the smoking of this object that had belonged to the Earthquake from Triana he might inhalesome of the man 's invulnerability . " ' They 're saying over at the Gallango that you 're making another comeback , " said Chaves , his fingers twirling the ' gar in his lips and the other hand holding his lighter to the end like a glass blower . " They say Madrid 's offered you four hundred thousand pesetas for a comeback fight . " " Osu , que miedo ! " Belmonte 's head went back and his jaw jutted out like a barracuda as the noises he called laughing came out . " Jesus , what fear ! Four hundred thousand pesetas is what I would offer to anyone able to put me in condiciones fisicas to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to the ring only like today , to sit in the box of the presidente of the ring . " " You 're advising today ? " " Yes , I asked for it . El Gallo and I. We want to give the baby here a good sendoff . Well , I 'd better go take a look at the cattle if I 'm going to see them before they go into the stalls . "  |p40Pacote  did n't want him to leave , as though he might learn the secret of survival from this man who had retired three times , who had fought three " last " corridas . But he could think of nothing more to say to keep him and they shook hands . Belmonte said undramatically , but looking hard into Pacote 's eyes , " The danger in a last fight is not in the cattle , boy . It 's in oneself . The crowd suddenly seems very loving and tolerant , and you forget the beast it has been in the past . One is tempted to , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminder of one 's greatness . " " I feel no such urge , " said Pacote with a wry smile , " I assure you . " " Not now you do n't , " said Belmonte . He fumbled in his pocket and brought out a little worn silver medallion . " Look , boy , Fin neither one of those superstitious ones nor the highly religious ones , but I had this thing with me when I fought my retirement fights . As I say , I 'm not much of a man for relics and such , but it would do no harm for you to wear it . I was going to bring it up to you at the hotel when you were dressing , but now I wo n't bother to go . " Pacote took the little medal gratefully and put it in his pocket . " Gracias , Don Juan . Gracias . " " It will bring you luck . Training and skill are fine , but a little luck . . . " Belmonte smiled , " that 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more to say , and they shook handagain , and Belmonte turned and went into the corrals . As they walked back along the river , Pacote said : " Wha . are you going to do , Pepe ? " " When ? "  | " After . " They 'd discussed it before , but he wanted to talk , to get his mind off the bulls . " Find some half-assed kind , " said Chaves , fanning his sweaty fat face with his wig . " Make a torero out of bull fodder , like I did you . And you , you 'll be loafing around Cordoba breeding cathedrals with sabers to hurt my kid . " Pacote put his hand in his pocket . He felt Belmonte 's medallion and it was good to linger it . Wonderful to feel it . " Pepe , I 'm going to make that ranch really beautiful . It 's going to have a parlor like nothing you ever saw . Nobodyin my family ever had a house with a parlor. 1 always dreamed of the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have big red plush curtains , see , and a thick carpet , so thick you actually feel yourself sink in it , and potted plants around and tiles set in the wall . You 'll come up , and after a wonderfuldinner of gazpacho and paella we 'll sit around in the parlor and drink and talk . Then we 'll ride around and look at the calves . Or we can go out and watch the fish jump . I 'm going to put fish in the pond , not to catch them but ) ust to watch them jump in the evening . " He walked along ilently for a while , warm in the wonderful scenes he couldimagine in such detail but could n't describe . Then he said : ' Why do n't you come be my mayoral , chico ? " He could eel the bas-relief of the little Virgin . His fingers clutchedconvulsively . " I 'm going to raise the best damn bulls in ' pain . God knows we have the money to do it . " Chaves grinned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hico . When I hear the oles they 're for me too . But I'llhelp you set it up . " " Do n't you ever want to get married ? You a maricon or something ? "  | " I been married . " " Owl droppings ! " Pacote exclaimed . " No , really , I was married . I was fished when I was twenty . Caught by the sash . " " Now I know Christ is coming again . What was she  --  a three-year-old Miura ? " " She was a gypsy from Triana , una gitana legitima . And she was young , and prettier than the sea , and I was on top of the world after my debut fight in Madrid . I wanted her more than I ever wanted anything in my life . But she would n't give it to me . She said she wanted to get married . So I said all right , we 'll be married . So we had a ceremonyin my hotel room . My banderilleros were the witnessesand my picador came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded like Latin and he made a fine fat priest . I guess  --  God , I ca n't even remember her name  --  I guess she was n't too bright , because ... " " You know what they say : Talk about the miracle all you want , but do n't mention the saint 's name . " " Well , anyway , she did n't catch on and  --  Lola , that 's it ! That was her name  --  and she thought we were really married . After the ceremony the priest and the witnesses got out , and Lola and I were just about to  --  how do they call it in books  --  consummate the union ?  --  when her brothers and her father broke into the room . They were big and I was little and they had knives and I did n't , and they marched me over to Triana and married us again . You ought to see a gypsy wedding . It takes three days . Four months later I caught her catting around , and I left her and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pepe . " Chaves grunted inquisitively at the different tone in Pacote'svoice . " Pepe , I 've been thinking about that will . " Chaves threw his cigar away . " That 's a hell of a thing t o be thinking about ! " " No , I was just thinking maybe I should have mentioned Matagatos and Cascabel somewhere along the line instead of just dumping it all on my mother and telling her to take care of them . " " That 's a hell of a thing to be thinking about . " He put his hand on Pacote 's shoulder roughly . " Let 's just skip t hat , eh ? We 'll talk about it tomorrow . " The nervous anger came suddenly . " All right , " he rasped . " Now tell me the truth , god damn it , tell me what you really think of the Miuras ! " " I told you , Pacote , " said Chaves quietly . " They 're all right . " Pacote caught him by the lapels . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We 've never operated that way , chico . " Pacote released the other 's coat . " No , " he said contritely , " we 've never operated that way . " They started walking again . As they went by the Tower of Gold , they saw two ragged boys playing at bullfighting . One , a skinny tenyear-oldwith a shaved head , had a gunny sack spread over a wooden sword which he shook at the other boy , grunting professionally : " Huh , toro , huh ! " The bull , crouched over and holding a pair of slaughterhouse horns in front of him , pawed the ground and then charged.  | " Me , " said Pacote thoughtfully as he stopped to watch . " And me , " said Chaves . The " matador " now held the sack differently , reaching around in back of him to grasp the cloth by the corner . It was the pacotina pass . Again the bull charged . " Ole , " Chaves called . " But watch that animal , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the men open-mouthed . " Pacote ! " gasped the " matador . " He looked as though he might almost drop to his knees in reverence . " Si , chiquillo , " said Chaves grinning , " and if you 're goingto be like him , and if I 'm going to manage you , you 'll have to keep your knees stiffer and run your arm more . " Pacote had seen hundreds of boys at this game , but for some reason the grimy faces and bare feet and the professionalway the skinny one had worked his mouth and frowned as he cited the bull moved him profoundly . Suddenlylie took out his wallet and pulled out all the money in it . " Here , " he said and slapped the five thousand pesetas into the " matador 's " filthy hand . " Divide it . " He walked on , leaving the boy staring dumbly after him , the bills fluttering off the unclosed hand to the ground . " The man 's out of his mind , " muttered Chaves to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck , " said Pacote . " And for God 's sake , remind me to clip this medallion on my chain before the fight . "  |p45WHEN  THEY CAME into the hotel lobby they saw a group of newspapermen lounging around the tiled fountain in the patio . They hurried up to Pacote and a photographersnapped a picture as he strode to the elevator . " How about a statement , Matador ? " one of them called . " Anything , " said another , " just something about how you feel , anything . " " - What do you think of Tano Ruiz ? " asked another . " I low are the Miuras ? " One was the American , and he said , " Please , Senor PaCote , could I talk to you in your room ? " But Chaves elbowed them aside and kept walking . " I lave some kindness , senores , " he growled . " A little kindness . After the fight Paco will talk all you want . " They stepped into the elevator and the grill slid across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , Suarez , the monkeyfacedsword boy , was there stripping the white protective covers off a green and silver uniform and laying it out onp46the chair . He was no boy but a fifty-year-old man , and he had been with Pacote for ten years . His hair was cut short , and he looked like one of those grinning clay heads that one puts seeds in to grow grass hair . " Good day , Mata'or , " said the little man , brushing a finger by his head in a salute . " I took the liberty of orderinglunch for you . " " Put that one away . " This was terribly important . " I want the white and gold . " It was three years old , but he 'd had luck wearing it . " Hola , old one , " he said as an afterthought , rubbing his hand over Suarez 's cropped head affectionately . There was a tray on the desk with a thin steak still steaming with the olive oil it was cooked in , a potato omelet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drank it sitting on the edge of the bed . " You better eat something , " said Chaves , handing him the plate with the steak . " You 'll be weak otherwise . " " And if I get a horn in me ? " " You 're not going to be operated on today . You 're not going within three feet of them . Eat ! " Pacote cut a piece of steak , but halfway to his mouth he stopped the fork and put it down on the plate . He cut the meat into small pieces very precisely and then gave it to the dog and pushed the tray away . Chaves looked at him sharply , but did n't say anything . Then he stood up abruptly and pulled the shades . " It 's onethirty , chico . Get some sleep . " " Where you going ? " asked Pacote . " I 've got something to do , " said Pepe uneasily.  | " What ? " asked Pacote . " Just something . " Pacote looked at him suspiciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Listen , I 've been thinking about Nino de Ronda . He could mess up everything . Get us all killed . Maybe we ought to get someone else . " " He 's all right . " Chaves 's eyes wandered to the partlyfilledwhiskey bottle on the dresser . But they did n't really wander ; it was as though that bottle with the staid label printed like a government bond had been bothering him for some time . " He 's not that bad . Get some sleep . I 'll be in my room in about half an hour if you want anything . " The sword boy went out , and Chaves started to follow . Then he swung around and grabbed the bottle and clumsily tucked it under his coat . " For a friend of mine , " he mumbled , and went out the door without looking at Pacote . The great protective Pepe , Pacote said to himself . Well for God 's sake , I was n't going to drink it . Maybe I 'm a in-le shot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clothes and climbed into the bed which had n't been made yet . He fell into a fitful sleep almost immediately . He woke up knowing someone had slipped into the darkenedroom . Then he heard Compadre 's belated growl . " Who is it ? " he asked , sitting up , the clock in his head telling him that it was too early for Chaves or Suarez to be comming to get him ready . " Me , " said a voice , and he knew it was the American.  | " What do you want ? " Pacote asked , but not gruffly , almost eagerly , glad to have been taken away from his nightmares . " To talk to you if I could , " said Newton . " 1 should have interviewed you earlier today before all those others came around . I had a hell of a time getting up here away from them . " Pacote turned on the light and stuffed the pillow behind him . It was nice and cool on the side he had n't been lying on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd spent all his adult life in bed stuffing a pillow behind hint to semisitup so that someone who was entirely safe and would always be safe could ask him questions . " Would you like a drink ? " he asked . " All right , " Newton said . " Sure , I 'd like one . Sorry about barging in like this , but this story 's very important to rue . " " On the dresser , " said Pacote . " Will you have one ? " " I have to fight today . " " And you mean you ca n't drink before a performance ? I should think you 'd want a little shot or two for your nerves . I should think it would make you braver . " " We have a saying  --  a man can get very drunk , but he never gets so drunk he eats a live coal . " " Good quote . But I 'd think it would make you more inventive , too , having a drink or two . " " A drunk tightrope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way too . " Pacote reached for a cigarette from the bed table and lit it . " But he 'd fall off the wire before he could do them . "  | " So bullfighters never drink before a performance ? " " Not unless they 're bored with breathing . " Newton made a note on a piece of paper folded in his wallet . Then he went to the dresser . " I do n't see any battle . " That 's right . The Great Protector had taken it . " There is one in the top drawer . " Newton took the bottle out and poured the drink . Then he carne over and sat in a chair by the bed . " Salud y pesetas . " He held up his drink . " Health and wealth . " " And love without a mother-in-law , " Pacote answered automatically . " That 's a new one . " " No , it 's old , " he said . He watched Newton drink , yearning for some of the amber fear medicine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well , " said Pacote , blowing out smoke through his nose . " I can say ' ow moch yew charch fer dat fairy fine ombrella ! " " That 's fine , " Newton grinned . " ' Where did you learn that ? " " I do n't know . A book , I think . " He made himself look sway from the man 's half-empty glass . " Do you mind my being here ? " Newton asked . " I 've got some questions I 'd sure like to ask you . " " I have to fight soon . " " I never in my life went through anything like that time We saw you in Mexico . I did n't realize that just a man and  --  red cloth and a bull could , you know  --  sort of transport a person . " Newton drank again , and Pacote watched thep50liquid go down his throat . " Please do n't do anything like that today . I could n't take it twice . " Pacote managed a grim smile . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was just joking . I guess you just have to be great today . After all , people have come from all over the world just to see it . " Newton took out his paper and pencil again . " One thing I wanted to know is why you never smile in the ring like the other fighters . " " It 's a very serious thing , this thing of the bulls . " " You know , we saw you once in America , in the StorkClub . You and your wife . It was a few months ago . " " Oh ? " " Yes . Is your wife here with you ? " " I 'm not married . " " Your sweetheart ? " " Something like that . " " She here ? " " She 's in Granada . " " How come she 's not here ? " Pacote did n't answer . This American 's questions were beginning to irritate him . But he did n't want him to go and leave him alone . " I 've relived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . I just hope today 's that good . The grace , the ballet of it . That pass with the cape you do , you know , the veronica . It 's just like a dance step . The whole thing is just a terrific ballet . " " Just a ballet , " Pacote said . His irritation was building . " But if you make a mistake you pay for it with an au-topsy. "  |p51Newton  looked at the scar on Pacote 's chest . " Have you had many wounds ? " " I 've been pretty lucky . " " How many though ? Sorry to have to pump you this way but I 've got to get all this information . " " My share . " God , how to shut him up ? " A few perhaps ? " " Perhaps . " " I 've heard a rumor that the reason you fight so suicidallyis that you 've got T.B . and do n't care about living anyway  --  that is n't true is it ? " Pacote shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pneumonia when I was young . That 's all . I 'm no Tarzan , but I 'm all right . " He pronounced it Tahthann . Then he added " And I care a lot about living , my friend . " " What does it feel like to have a horn go in you ? What do you think about while it 's happening ? " " Listen , " Pacote said . Anything to get him off this talk . " I think  --  think I 'll change my mind . Would you make me a drink ? A weak one . " " Sure , I would n't think one would hurt you . It 'll calm you down . " Ile made the drink for him and another one for himself . " No , listen , " Pacote said hastily . " I ca n't . Throw it out . " " I should think it would calm you down . I always used to have a couple of shots before I boxed at college . " He handed him the glass . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'd better hrov it out . It looks strong . "  | " Well , I always say good whiskey does n't need water and bad whiskey does n't deserve it . " Pacote regarded the glass warily , but then he drank . He savoured it gratefully . " What does it feel like ? " Newton persisted . " It feels good , " he said looking at his glass and knowing the man did n't mean the drink . " No , I mean getting gored . " " Well , it feels as though you were on a very hard and sharp horn , and you wish sincerely that you were off of it . Or that you had gone into cabinetmaking , the way your mother had hoped you would . " " Your mother wanted you to be a carpenter ? " " My mother wanted me to be a carpenter or a pimp or a burglar or a typhoid carrier or anything that did n't have to do with bulls . " He suddenly had to talk . It was easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was married to a bullfighter who was killed . Fuentes . Maybe you 've heard of him . Then she married my father , and he was a pretty good fighter  --  not too good , I guess , but pretty good  --  and he began to go blind . He stayed in the game as long as he could distinguish the shape of the bull  - -  sometimes he saw two bulls  --  you can imagine he took a lot of punishment  --  and then he died in the poorhouse . So you can see that the bulls were n't very good to my mother . " " But they 've been good to you . " Pacote shrugged . " God says take what you want  --  but pay for it . "  | " Are n't you glad you 're somebody , " Newton said , " something great , and not just a carpenter ? " He drank . " You picked the wrong day to ask me that . Ask me tomorrow . " " I think it 's the only thing left in this neon world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're medieval . You 're all like something out of another age . Or mythology . If you wanted to get fancy , you could say thepicador is a centaur and the toreador is the god of the dance . " " Torero , " Pacote said trying to keep the irritation out of his voice . " There 's no such word as toreador . " " There is n't ? " " Only in the song . " Newton had covered one side of his paper with jottings , and he turned it over and folded it the other way . " Say , how about that streak in your hair ? Seems to me you did n't have that in Mexico , or at least not that gray . Does n't it bother you ? Sort of a ... " " A reminder of how old and shot I am ? " Pacote started to order him from the room , but he drank and took refuge in an aphorism . " Just because there 's a little snow on the roof does n't mean the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me like an old man and I 'm not even thirty yet ! " Pacote finished his drink , and Newton handed him another . But Pacote put it down on the bedside table hard . " Lisn , I have to fight ! In less than two hours . " Newton stood up . " And I better let you get some rest.  |p54Well  , I sure appreciate your talking to me , and I hope you have the greatest day of your life today . Lots of luck ! " He went out . Pacote groaned . He would n't get back to sleep now , and he knew it . He finished his drink and the rest of Newton 's . He got up and poured another . As he started to drink it there was a loud knock on the door. 55PACOTE quickly put the drink in the drawer , but the glass was too tall . The drawer would n't close , so he did n't open the door . " Who is it ? " he asked . " Solorzano , " said a coarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent made it " Manway Tholothano . " " Chaves left word for me to come around and see him . " " His room is down the hall , " said Pacote , " two-o-seven . " He heard the man move away from the door . Solorzano ! So that was it . That 's what Pepe had up his sleeve that he did n't want to say anything about . Even epe thought he was so completely gone  --  so helpless  --  liable to get killed today  --  that he had gone out and hired protection , the most butchering , criminal picador inbusiness ! Pacote took the drink out of the drawer and drained it . So that 's what we 've come to ! Solorzano , who was hiredNino de Ronda for his last fights as a matador , when cry day he 'd have a bull returned to the corral becausep57he did n't dare get close enough to even stick it in the lungs ; Solorzano , without whom the cowardly gypsy Cagancho would n't fight ; Solorzano , the darling of every ancient retiredmatador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid who 'd been pushed too fast and really did n't know how to dominate a bull but just had some superficial filigree stuff . So that 's what we 've come to . Even Pepe had lost confidence in him . And right now ( ; haves was talking to this butcher , a jackal Pepe would n't spit on ordinarily , talking to him , begging him to protect t his poor wreck of a gutless coward ! Pacote put on his Paisley dressing gown quickly and went out into the hall . Chaves 's room was only five doors down .  --  When he came near the room he saw the door was open . He heard Chaves 's voice . He stopped , and , flattened up against the wall , he listened . " And so then you 'll kill them , eh , Solorzano ? " Chaves was obviously eating , for the words could barely find their way out of his mouth . " Bear down on the iron like you 've never borne down in your life . Get them in the kidneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get them in the ass , get them in the ribs "  --  Pacote heard Chaves swallow the mouthful noisily  --  " just get them . But for God 's sake do n't cripple them  --  we do n't want to take the chance of getting that substitute bull . " Solorzano grunted . " Easy for you to say . You do n't yet the cushions . You do n't get the Fundador bottles in the back of the head . I got family and a lot of friends in this town . So 's my wife . It 's no fun to be called a butcher and a son of a whore in front of your friends . Why do n't you ask El Pimpi to kill your bulls for you ? "  | " I 'm going to tell him too . But you 're heftier and better . You can skin a bull from hump to tail . You can slip in three shots in one charge and leave the bull swaying and begging for the puntilla . I 've seen you do it every day when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Maybe , " said Solorzano , not without some pride in his fame in illegalities . " But I want to look good today . " " Look good ! " Chaves exploded . " Who in Christ 's name cares whether or not a picador looks good ? " " A picador 's family , " said Solorzano in an injured tone , " that 's who ! " Chaves let out that little mirthless laugh that he always gave when he was trying to control his temper . " Sure , sure . But listen . You realize what an important day this is . " He used his persuasive , confidential tone , as though he were talking to a recalcitrant child . " The greatest torero since Joselito is bowing out . Maybe the greatest who ever lived . We got to see he bows out and does n't get carried out. , , " Was , " said Solorzano smugly . " Was . " There was a scuffling sound and a grunt as though Chaveshad caught Solorzano up by the lapels and jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you son of the great whore , " he hissed , " is , is , is ! You sister-raping bastard , you are n't fit to be in the same ring with him . The only reason I hired you was because we 're in a bad spot and you can butcher a bull dirtier than anybody in the business . " There was a silence and Pacote knew Chaves was work/ing to control himself . Though he 'd come to eavesdrop , suddenly he did n't want to hear any more . But he was held there by the savagery of the words he knew would come . " How come you 're so anxious to get the bulls grinded down if he 's still so great ? " growled Solorzano , but he did n't say it aggressively ; he sounded respectful of the little fat man . " Because he has n't fought for six months and his eggs are up in his throat with fear . And he 's on the big bottle . And I hear he was way off in Mexico last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sigh , and the chair creaked as he sagged back in it . " Yes , he 's stale . And sure , all right , his timing is off , way off . You ca n't go the way he 's been going for ten years and expect anything else . Every other fighter in the world can fight one good fight and then coast through three or four . But Pacote is Pacote , and he 's had to fight every fight of his life as though it was the Prensa or the Policia in Madrid . And why do you think they 've ut him on this pedestal , eh ? Why , eh ? " " People always want to see The Best . They 'll always want to see the one who gets paid the most . " " No , man , no . It 's more than that . Much more than at . It 's not just that he 's a better bullfighter than any of cm ! Supposing this Tano Ruiz were better than Pacote . They 'd go see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , cote is more than just the best bullfighter . Each time he es out in the ring , whether here or Mexico or Peru , everyone says , look , there 's a real Spaniard , that 's the kind guts Spaniards used to have when Spain was the Num/ber One nation . That 's partly why today is going to be so awful . Because he gets at least double what most fighters get , they expect to see double . And that 's impossible . It does n't work that way . He gets double or triple but he can only do half again what other fighters do . They keep demanding more and more every fight and he has n't any more to give . He 's just a man , after all , and there 's just so much a man can do with a bull without eating it alive . He 's no magician . The people created a myth around him , which is fine . Fine for the wallet . But the myth has gotten bigger than the man . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't have to drink and make it worse . Nobody makes him drink the way I hear he 's been doing . " " She makes him drink . That  --  that gachi does it . She 's dragged poor Pacote through the street of bitterness with her tricks . Right through the street of bitterness . He 's got more horns than a freight car full of snails . Thank God she 's in Granada this month and not messing things up around here . " He put his voice into falsetto . " Taking the baths , my dear "  --  his voice dropped  --  " while Paco 's facingArmageddon . " He belched . " He should have been out on the ranches. all this time sharpening himself up with the calves . But she does n't like ranches , so he 's either been messing around with her and that crowd or toreando the bottle because he 's not with her . " " He should have quit a year ago . " " We said we were going to quit when we got back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did it . " " Y amor propio , " said Solorzano . " And self-love . " " And that too , " sighed Chaves . " You ca n't be a great anything without that . That 's what makes toreros andp61that 's what kills them . Do n't go  --  I want to talk . I 've got to talk  --  I 'm sorry , man , about that  --  a moment ago , you know . But well , you know , this is a bad day . It 's a terrible day for me . I made this boy . You got to help me . " " That 's all right , " said Solorzano . " I 'm nervous , too . More nervous than the sea . I just do n't like Miuras , that 's all . " " I made him , " continued Chaves as though he had n't heard the apology . " And I love the man . I turned him from a clown to Number One in the world . You should have seen him when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his knees when he did a veronica . It was in Malaga when I happened to see him . " Solorzano had heard the story a thousand times . Everyone in Spain knew the story . " It was a nocturnal , and all the kids were bad , but he was the worst . He looked like a stork . All legs and neck . He looked like an undriven nail , one of the newspapers said . And then that face . He took it all so seriously they used to say his face was as dreary as a third-class funeral on a rainy day . The people were dying laughing . They did n't sec he was doing all the wrong passes for his build . They did n't see the guts he had to go back and back to the instiltsand the cushions . But I saw it . I saw this kid had everything I never had . The self-love , the drive , the having to be good . I guess if you want to analyze it , it was because of his sister  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's poverty and all that business . But you knew t hat , did n't you ? How he found her in a whorehouse when he was about fifteen ? Just went into a whorehouse one night and there was his sister . Everyone knows it . That 's the awful part of it  --  everyone knows it . If I 'd had whatp62that kid had I could have been the greatest bullfighter who ever lived . I had the build  --  you 'd never believe it now  --  but I did . You do n't believe me ? I did , I tell you I had the build . And I had a feeling for bulls that even Paco has n't got , though I did n't have Paco 's fighting heart . But I saw I could teach this boy . With my brains and his blood , I saw the sky was the limit , that we could revolutionize bullfighting . And he 's the best that ever was or will be . He is Paco . He 's me . He 's us  --  me and him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pepe . " Chaves went on dreamily as though to himself , his voice husky with emotion . " I jerked him out of those nocturnals and I took him up to the ranch . I fed him up and then I could see he had a perfect build . He had good shoulders and a good butt . You can tell a lot about a man by his butt . He just did n't know how to carry himself , how to walk . The first thing I did was tape splints on his knees . Would n't let him in the practice ring without them for three months . That took care of that dip in the knee all right . " He gave his breathy , panting laugh at the remembrance . " He still walks stiff-legged in the ring because of that . " " Sure , but I 've got to go now . " " Would n't let him do any passes but the five classic ones . Then we added the pacotina , of course . That was just an old pass of La @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " " Listen , Pepe , I got to go now . " " Oh , all right , man . Now we 're squared away , are n't we ? You 'll cut the cattle down ? "  | " Osu , Pepe , I want to look  --  " " You can look good on another fight , " Chaves said harshly . " Do n't you see he could get killed today ! If he coasts all the way and stabs them in the lungs , we 'll all be at the dinner tonight having a fine time and getting good and drunk . But Tano is out to commit suicide today to try to show the maestro up . He 's out to cut tails and hoofs . I , et him . But if Paco starts trying to compete with that kid , he 'll be in trouble . If he gets a good bull he 'll be inclined to work closer . So that 's where you come in . You see to it that every bull arrives at the muleta like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything with an animal that 's too shot to charge . " " So I get credit for his flop . I 'll need some extra money for that . " " You 're already getting plenty ! Twice what Tano 's men are getting . " " What 's the great Pacote worth these days ? Forty millionpesetas ? Fifty ? More ? He wo n't miss an extra thousandduros . " " Sure , only five thousand pesetas . And do you think you or I would have the guts to make even one thousandpesetas the way he made those millions ? Every peseta st inks of blood , his blood and bull 's blood . Sure , he 's rich , he 'll be the richest man in the graveyard if you do n't do what I 'm paying you for ! All right , we 'll make it five more . " There was a tearing sound . " Here 's half of it . " He added significantly : " You get the other half after the fight . " There was a scraping of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solorzano whine : " Always the hard way , eh Pepe ? I 'll have to paste them together afterwards . Well , I guess I 'll grab me some rest and ... " Pacote ducked into his room . He closed the door and leaned back against it and closed his eyes . He could feel the sweat damp on his forehead and prickly on his scalp under his hair . " Mother of God , Mother of God , " he breathed . " Even Pepe , even old Pepe . " After a while he opened his eyes . There was a fly on the ceiling . It did n't move  --  just clung there upside down . He went to the dresser and took a long drink from the bottle in the drawer behind his socks . He had been partly hiding it from Chaves and partly from himself . He went over to the bed and flopped down on it . He pushed his face that was dark yet pale into the mattress . It smelled soggy and old and a little like blood . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finish it and at the same time trying to make himself forget this insane idea , when a little knock came on the door . People . Good . The sooner people came the sooner one got into the part and the easier it was to play this rotten game of bullfighter . " Come in . " She opened the door and stuck her head in impishly , saying in a put-on childish voice : " Is this the room of the famous Pacote and may I please ... " " Soco ! " " . . . have his autograph , please , please , please ? "  |p65HE  JUMPED UP . He went to her and put his arms around her and kissed her , aiming for her mouth but hitting mostly cheek . The expensive perfume and the faint , good , animal smell of her stung his nostrils like cognac in a snifter glass . " Ay , Senor Matador , " she said , dropping her voice . " Easy on my make-up . " She pulled away slightly and wrinkled her nose exaggeratedly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day of a fight , Pacotito ? " " That 's just from last night , " he murmured . " What are you doing down here ? I thought you were up there till next week . " " Oh , we just all got the idea to come down for the fight today , so down we came in my little old Citroen . How are the bulls ? " She asked it with the same solicitous lack of concern of a person 's inquiring after another 's head cold , but the fact that she had asked at all pleased him inordinately . " They 're all right . They 're fine . "  | " That 's good . That 's wonderful , darling . You know , we 've got to do something about that streak of yours . It seems even lighter . It 's almost white now . Maybe we ought to dye it . " She tugged at the shade and let it roll further up . " Mind ? " The sun streamed around her , making her chic white dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Velasquez portrait . Her dark brown hair , bobbed attractively out of fashion , was suddenly gilded . The glare gave her wrinkles  --  wrinkles she did n't really have  --  around the incredible green eyes . " Sevilla la maravilla , " she said mock-poetically . The squinting made her lookslightly Oriental . " Look at Sevilla , now . So sleepy . Peoplehome after mass . Taking siestas , eating . Think how gay it will be in a little while . " Oh yes , he thought . Gay as all hell . " How was Gra-nada ? " " Granada ? " She watched a carriage clop along aroundp67the tree-lined square and pull up beside the other hacks that nudged the battered taxis , waiting for the big scramble to begin . " Oh , Granada was Granada . Sad . But there were some people there who were very gay . There was this man Ali Ben Mascarenhas , you know , who boughtranco 's yacht . He invited us to catch them in Valencia text week and cruise around Morocco . He has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd love him . And the Marques de La Huerta and Cucu and Norberto and all of hem . You know . " He knew . All those people who were so dreadfully gay and rich and well dressed and always asking him questions bout bullfighting . And it was lucky they did for they could tune him out , not meaning to , when they discussed her subjects . They did n't at first because they were so impressed by being with the great Pacote . But when they it used to him and found that out of the ring he was just a man , a quiet , shy man who had no small talk and whose tire raison d'etre was predicated on the fact that he happened to be able to do one thing better than anyone else in the world , they lost interest . And even about bullfighting they generally spent most of the time telling him their ideasit , which was just as well for Pacote , as he did n't like talk much anyway , and it was especially boring to talk but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to back up their misconceptions with technical talk . His greatest bond with them was that they drank too much , did n't work , and had plenty of money . t he did n't even drink the way they did . He drank for oblivion , like a peasant ; they went along , never getting fall/ing-down drunk but always in a gentleman 's sherry haze . Yet they were probably his best friends . He 'd outgrown the few friends of his youth . They were shopkeepers , bartenders , hod carriers , bricklayers now . And it was hard to be good friends with other bullfighters because of rivalry and egotism . No , outside of Pepe , who was n't accepted by them , these wasters were technically his best friends . And if it were not for Socorro and if it were not for the fact that he was a successful bullfighter , the most successful bullfighter , he would not be their friend . He would be nothing . He would simply be what everyone knew he was  --  the brother of a whore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorhouse . Suddenly he realized Socorro had been talking. " ... and then when Norberto arrived we did the cutest thing . They had n't seen each other for a month  --  since Madrid  --  and he did n't even know that Cucu was in Andalucia . He thought she was still in San Sebastian ! Well ! When we arrived at the door of the Duquesa 's party , we handed him a ribbon and told him that everyone was to receive a present , and he was to follow it to find out what his was . So he began following the ribbon and it went upstairsand down and out into the garden and back upstairs to a closet , and in the closet was Cucu ! " She started to laugh . Then louder , and soon she was laughing , not at what had struck her funny but at herself laughing . " Do n't you think that was cute ? That was my idea . Tres amusant , no ? Do n't you think it was a good one ? " " Very good . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackness of the Miura images that sulked at the edges of his brain. 69 " They became engaged that night . " She always wore the suggestion of a smile that made strangers on the street think they knew her . She looked as though she had hundreds of delicious secrets that she could share if she only wished to . Despite her past  --  and her present  --  there was something girlish and fresh and virginal about her . It was as though her exterior had been fashioned with no thought toward who the occupant would be . Even her good figure , untrammeled by constricting undergarments , looked as though it had traces of baby fat . God , she looked so beautiful . " Why do n't we become engaged tonight ? " He said it lightly , but he almost meant it . Almost meant it in spite of the fact that he knew it could never work . " Do n't you think it would look a little silly on us , darling ? Theoretically we 've been engaged three years . " It was closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stretch it . As she spoke , her green eyes appraised herself in the glass above the bureau ; she was a mirror watcher . " It would please the American Ambassador . " This made her smile automatically at her reflection , for it was an old joke with them . Now they remembered the times they had relived it better than the incident itself . Two years before , he had been lured to Peru , for the first time , for six fights at twenty thousand dollars apiece . The Peruvians took their bullfighting almost as seriously as the Mexicans , and he was lionized beyond belief . They told everyone that they were married ; Lima being such a small town socially , it made it easier for everyone . Most people knew better , however , and a delectable subject for Limenos at cocktail parties was whether or not they were married.  |p70In  a bid for Peruvian popularity the American Ambassador decided to give a large reception for the visiting matador . Socorro and Pacote were driven to the Embassy by GeneralGrana and his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the large ballroom . The little Ambassadorbustled up to them and said in his midwestern twang : " Buenos noches , Mr. and Mrs. P'coty , buenos noches . " " I 'm sorry , " said Senora Grana , " but I am not Mrs. Pacote . " " Perfectly all right , perfectly all right , " the Ambassador said knowingly . " We Americans are broad-minded peo-ple . " " But I am not Mrs. Pacote ! " she insisted . " Tut tut , my dear , " said the Ambassador , " you know that you two are as welcome here as if you were married . " Ile then led them into the receiving line and introduced them to the visiting dignitaries . Senora Grana , who had a sense of humor , decided to link her arm in Pacote 's and enjoy being the wife of the world 's Number One matador . When her husband trailed after her , protesting : " Darling , what the devil is this ? " , she turned to the Ambassador and said with an airy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man  --  he 's just my husband 's sword boy ! " Yes , they had laughed over it so many times that now it was impossible to garner any reaction from it , or even to be positive that it had happened at all . " We should get married really for the dear little foolish Ambassador , " Socorro said brightly . She went to the bureau , opened a drawer , and took out a handkerchief.  | " They 've mixed in a lot of mine with yours , " she said , as she removed a smudge of lipstick from the corner of her full mouth . " So that 's why I do n't have any ! " She put several handkerchiefs in her little jeweled purse . Compadre raised his head , and , looking at Socorro , he gave a familiar half-bark as a sort of afterthought and dropped his had again . Pacote gave him a reassuring pat . Then he noticed her earrings , small and star-shaped and terribly expensive looking . He tried to be casual as he asked : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? " " Oh , these ? " She turned her head sharply , as though if she were quick enough she might get a glimpse of them on her lobes . " They are nice , are n't they ? " She frowned . " You know , you ought to get rid of that dog . He smells . " " Granada ? " he asked feeling the tightening in his chest . " It 's as though something crawled into him and died . " She took a cigarette and match off his bureau and plunked down in the big chair . " Yes , Granada , as a matter of fact "  --  she nicked the match with a lacquered thumbnail  --  " and darling , I overdrew at the bank to "  --  she lit the cigarette and puffed twice  --  " to pay for them . Do you suppose you could "  --  she blew out a cloud of smoke  --  " do something about it ? " She had never bought herself any jewelry in her life  --  never had had to . The large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch , he had given her . Also the little gold bracelet with the brands of the different bull ranches on it , but he never inquired about the origin of the countless other bracelets that clanged on her forearms or the very expensive-looking diamond fish with a rubyp72eye that was clipped on the front of her dress . " I 'll have Chaves take care of it in the morning . " It was probably Ali Ben whatever his name was . But it was n't true that he had horns , the way Chaves said . Men were mad for her and any girl liked men 's attentions and that was all there was to it . He knew that before he had met her she had lived with the man who had directed her first and only moving picture  --  a very bad picture . But she had been faithful to him until he went to England . And afterwards there was Guilbert , the French sportsmanracer . He was also sure she had been true to him until his Alfa-Romeo had gone over an embankment and crushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , in spite of Chaves , who only said what he said because he hated her . And then , unaccountably he remembered the refrain Pepe was fond of quoting : " She 's not a whore , she who lies abed making love with him and them and thee and me  --  A whore is she who has the soul of a whore , even though a virgin she still may be . " " How were the baths ? " he asked . She opened her mouth , let the smoke laze out , and ended by yawning and giving a half-laugh at herself . He had the idea she had been drinking . Not much . She was too smart and too vain to ever drink too much . " Tired ? " he asked . " Well , " she said smiling . " I 've been up all day ! " God , she had such charm when she smiled . They wereso different , he thought : as different as coal and snow . " Oh , the baths were fine . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dangled from the epaulet of the gold costume . She was getting restless already . " It fixed my foie up perfectly . " She loved to use French words , especially in bed , and it annoyed him because he knew she had learned every word from Guilbert . " Now I am all ready to ruin my foie again by eating too much foie and drinking too much champagne . " She had a wayward eyebrow that would assert its independence while she talked and gave her a roguish look . " I have a wonderful idea ! Let 's take a long walk in the Parque Maria Luisa right now . " He froze . He stared at her intently as though he had n't heard her right and his nerves started to take over , almost letting him blurt out : A walk , good Christ , are you mad ? But he clenched his hands around the brass end of the bed and compressed his lips flat against his teeth . This alonenesswas what killed . This always having to go it alone , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outburst would just bring on a defensive pout and a mumble of you-never-understand . And it was foolish and childish to say , Why do n't you think about me once in a while ? So he smiled and forced some warmth into his voice . " A walk , Soco ? " " Yes , would n't it be fun ? We can come out on the Palmera , because I told Norberto and Cucu that I 'd meet them at the Bi-Lindo for a drink before the  --  " She turned around and her face registered distress . " Oh , darling , I forgot that you 're fighting today ! "  |p174Her  apology , something so rare , made him feel superior for a few seconds , and hate welled up inside him for all the times she had hurt him with her indifference . " Paco , love , how could I have been so thoughtless ? " She kissed him . " That 's all right , " he said brusquely . His tone wiped the distress mask from her face , and she turned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loathing himself . " That 's all right , " he said , meaning it this time . He pretended , to her and to himself , that she had n't really forgotten . " It would be relaxing , take my mind off this business . " He made a show of looking at his watch . " But we have n't much time . We 'll take a long walk tomorrow . " " But I told La Penaranda that we 'd all go out to the finca for lunch . " He nodded numbly . It did n't make any difference , really . Tomorrow was so far away it seemed as though it were another century . He looked at his watch again , this time to see what time it was . They 'd be here in twenty minutes . He could alreadyhear the steady clop of carriages beginning down in the streets . It was n't the occasional clop of a dray cart or of a wagon with a plodding horse and lead donkey . It was the brisk , relentless , proud clopping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and country estates . He could hear the gay ching-ching-ching of the harness bells . " That 's twice , " said Socorro . She reached way overp175and turned on the radio . " You must be nervous . You 've looked at your watch twice . " " I 'm scared . I 'm always scared . " " You 're scared ? I never knew that . " He thought of saying : I guess there are things you do n't know about me . But he said : " My knees start to shake when I see my name on the first contracts . They do n't stop until the end of the season . Thank God this is the last . " Conchita Piquer came on the radio in the middle of " Child of Fire . " Socorro sang along with her , snapping her fingers in rhythm and writhing a little in the chair : " Insidemy soul 1 have a fountain , in case your guilt should wish to drink . . . . " It was gypsy wailing  --  the " deep singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arm of her chair , and as she shook her shoulders and clapped out the time , he could see down the front of her dress . He could see the good breasts that seemed to start their soft swell almost from the collarbone . It was as though he had never seen her undressed . He had n't had her for weeks now . It was like a glass of water when parched  --  before having it , there was nothing one wanted more , and after having it there was nothing one wanted less . But he wanted her now . " Soco ... " He slid his hand down the front of her dress and cupped one of her wonderful breasts , gently , letting it sit in his palm . He could see the pink nipple , like the eraser on a pencil , and he could feel it burgeon , feel it swell . He moved his fingers up and pushed the shoulder strap of her dress.  |p76It  slipped down to her elbow . The skin was very white compared with the rest of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it while sun bathing . " Ay , Pacorro , " Soco murmured , dropping her head over against his chest , watching interestedly in the big mirror as his hand took her breast again . " Such a long time . " " Now , now , now ! " he whispered in her ear , and her breath quickened automatically . She was easily aroused , always quicker than he , and it was fun to pull this trick on her , even at a crowded cocktail party . " Vamonos , " he breathed , standing up and pulling her to her feet . " Let 's go . " " Yes , " she said eagerly . She ground her cigarette out in the ash tray . She stepped out of her shoes . Then she crossed her arms , and grasping the hem of her white dress she stripped it off over her head . She had nothing on underneath , but the white where her bathing shorts had been looked like panties against her tan . He put his arms around her feeling her nakedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , terribly close to her . After all , this was all they really had in common . " My love ... " she said . She pulled away and pranced to the rumpled bed , her breasts bobbing saucily . She sat down on it , crossed her legs primly , cocked her head , and smiled at him mockingly , challengingly . He shed his dressing gown and walked to the other side of the bed and sat down . When he pulled her down on her back , she squirmed her legs onto the bed ecstatically . " Darling , " she murmured happily as she kissed the scarp77on his chest . " Such a very naughty business before a fight , such little bad things ... " The fight ! Good God , he 'd been able to forget it for a few moments , but now he felt the cold grab down there low in his body , felt his passion ooze into nothingness , felt his masculinity melt away . " I 'd  --  I 'd  --  " he began . He sat up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even Pepe thought there was a good chance of his getting killed today . " I was just joking , " she said . " Come on , darling . " She tried to pull him down on the bed again . " Paco ! " He stood up abruptly and walked to where he had dropped his dressing gown . After he had put it on he turned around . " You mean you 've got me like this and you 're going to leave me ? " she exclaimed . " I 'm sorry , Socorro . " " It was your idea , " she propped herself up on one arm , " and now you 're going to leave me like this ? " " I 'm sorry , " he said guiltily . " Afterwards . But now  --  now I 'd better save myself for the bulls . " She knew it was n't that . She knew it was just because he was n't able to . " Well , this is the first time this has happened , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... He came back and lay on the bed beside her , but she rolled away from him , giving him her back . When hep78started to run his hand over her body , she pulled away and got up . She put on her dress and shoes . Then she turned the radio up louder . " Do n't be angry , " he said , getting off the bed . " Ca n't you understand that I ... " " Who 's angry ? " she said with an indifferent laugh . " I 'm not angry . I understand how it is on a day like today . " " You know I love you very much . " She lit a cigarette ; then she said : " And I love you , too . " He snapped the radio off . " Listen , " he said , and it came out now by itself , with no pre-thought . " Listen , why do n't we get married ? " She looked at him with a half-smile . " How sweet of you , Paquito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never can tell , I might have jumped at the chance . " She turned the radio on again , and said " Sa-sa-sa-saa , " encouragingthe singer . " I did n't feel it was the life for a woman , " he mumbled . What he almost admitted to himself was that he had n't because he did n't want to marry a woman , no matter how much he loved her , that he was n't sure he could trust . Not knowing whether she loved him or just the Pacote legend and aura and money . But God , how he loved her , and now he felt an urgency , that he must marry her , or she would slip from him forever , that everything would slip from him . That everything would slip from him ! " No life for a woman ? " she exclaimed . " It 's a wonderful life for this woman . I like it . I like the excitement.  |p79I  like the people . I like the traveling . I like the crowds . " " And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is your last fight . Then what ? Sit on a ranch in back of Cordoba and watch the bulls and weeds grow ? Not for me , Paco darling . I came from the country , the poor country , the dirty country , the drab country ; I do n't ever want to go back . I like the sparkle of the city and the sparkle of the people you meet in the city . I might even make another moving picture . I 'm only twenty-seven . I 'm on top and headingup . " The way she said it was almost as though she 'd added : And your star is beginning to fizzle , my friend . " Do n't you ever want to be normal and have a home and children ? " he asked . " Live quietly ? Get to know yourself ? " She looked at him bemused , and her eyebrow went up . " ' You must be scared , Paco . I 've never heard you talk so much or so fancy . I want a drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took out the bottle from behind his socks . " Ah , " she said " a bureau-drawer drinker . " He felt himself flush a little as he poured a drink for her . " Say when . " " Epa , " she said when the glass was a fifth full . He wanted one himself . God , how he wanted one , but he could already feel the others too much . " In the first place , chico , " she said , taking a drink , and malting a face at the glass , " as long as we 're being so dread/fully frank , we 're not normal , thee and me . People who become actresses and bullfighters are n't normal . You take your choice , the glitter and the gold or the farm and the kids . You ca n't have them both . " She took a comb from her purse and ran it through her hair repeatedly , talking with her head tilted way over . " And I wonder if you really do want the farm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have . But while you were trying to get where you could retire to the good life , you made yourself into somebody who never could stand the good life . Becauseyou are n't anybody or anything but Pacote now . Stop me if I 'm talking too much , but I just came from a big luncheon , and the wine was flowing . " She laughed for no reason and drank again . " You stop being the great Pacote and you stop being . You just do n't exist . And I do n't think you 'd like not existing , chico , any more than I would . Do n't think I 'm being too harsh , Paco . Just frank . " She waggled her empty glass , and he took it from her and poured another drink . " So you , " he tried to control his voice , " you wo n't come to Cordoba with me ? " In a way , he wanted her to say it , as if in the saying of it would be a contract that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her forever . It would end the confusion , the indecision , the agony , and yet , of course , he knew that he could never want to be free of her . " Oh , that 's a long way off , " she said . Only it came out , " Hat 's a-hong hay aw , " because now she was looking into her compact mirror and applying lipstick . " I 'll be going up there next week , " he said significantly.  | " That 's very soon . " He saw her drink sitting there on the arm of the chair , golden and wonderful in the sun , and he wanted to snatch it up and gulp it down . " No , let 's go to Morocco next week . The whole gang is going on Franco 's yacht . " Defiantly , she snapped her compact shut and looked up at him . " Do n't you think it would be tires chic to go on the Generalisimo 's yacht ? " " Chaves and I are going to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was an ultimatum in his tone . " Well , you can damn well go alone , " Socorro said , suddenlysulky . " And see how you like sleeping with Chaves . " She turned the radio up louder , castanetting her fingers irritatedlywith the music and humming along : " Tell me , woman , if you can , when a love dies  --  where does it go ? " He reached over and snapped the radio off . " You mean  --  this is the end of us ? " " I mean I 'm not going to rot on a ranch in Cordoba or any other place . " She turned the radio on again . " And I 'm not going to play brood mare to your stallion ! " " And if I were n't getting out of the game ? " " Well , I guess we 'd just go on the way we are . Oh , darling , I do n't see what you 're quitting for anyway . You 're on top , you 're still young . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost forty-five . It 's that salamander Chaves who 's talked you into it . " " Look ! " He ran his fingers through the gray streak in his hair exasperatedly . " Look , now look  --  I should have quit a year ago , and Pepe had nothing to do with it , and all this is n't helping my nerves much . " " Well , do n't get so excited , " she said soothingly.  | " Maybe if you did n't drink so much , you would n't be so jumpy . " He laughed , something he did only when he did not think something was funny . Then he said slowly : " There are two black animals over in the stalls right now just quivering there in the dark waiting to kill me in "  --  he shoved back the sleeve of his dressing gown and looked at his watch  --  " in an hour , and you tell me not to be jumpy . " " Carat ' , Paco , " she complained , " you were never like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . He went to the bureau abruptly . He poured four inches of whiskey into a glass and drank most of it at one gulp . He felt its heat sock his stomach and the good warm numbing up the back of his neck . He filled the glass up again . " Darling , you need a rest , your nerves are all shot . " It was the tone that did it . She said it clinically . She said it coldly , from a long way away . " You 're in a hell of a state . Why do n't you come down on Ali Ben 's yacht with us ? We 're going to have a wonderfultime , and in a month or two you can start fighting again and be the old Pac  --  " He whirled and shot the whisky in her face . It was n't a very big glass , but she gasped as if a cold ocean wave had broken over her . She jumped up , trembling , her breath coming hard . " Now you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snarled . She swallowed twice as she tried to organize the torrent of emotions suddenly set to seething inside her . Thep83whiskey was dripping down her face and running down the front of her dress . " And you had the nerve to ask me to marry you ! You were perfectly happy to keep me just your mistress for years because you did n't think I was good enough to marry . Now that you 're through you come begging me to marry you . Me marry a eunuch ? Me marry the shell of a man ? Me marry somebody who 's so shot he has to drink his guts out of a bottle ? The great Pacote ! " She spat out a laugh . " The great Pacote who just wants to crawl off to Cordoba and rot on a farm like the peasant he is . I do n't know why I 've stuck with you and your nerves this long . The great Pacote ! The great ball-less wonder ! And of course your nerves are gone ! You know this kid is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quit before you get killed , and you know that when you quit you 'll be nothing , and you ca n't face it ! You ca n't face being just a picknose peasant and ... " " And the brother of a whore , " he cut in quietly . " I thought you 'd get around to that . Yes , sure . The brother of a whore , and the lover of a whore . You 'd better go if you 're going to have a drink with your friend before the corrida . " She strode to the door . " I hope they make a sieve out of you today , " she said , through her teeth . Then she was gone , and he was n't quite sure why things had happened as they did , but in a way he felt good about it , the decision was over . And in another way he wanted a drink very badly . He had it . As he threw it down he noticed that the fly was still clinging to the ceiling andp84had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got him into this mess , and now , he thought foolishly , it could get him out . Drink enough and the bulls would go away , everybody 'd go away . There 'd be no corrida.  |p85HE  HAD BEEN semi-drunk when he had agreed to this fight . What else was there for a retired matador to do in the city ? You either drank or you sat around regaling worshipers with tales of ring triumphs  --  and Pacote did n't like bull talk about himself . That day he and Socorro were at Chicote 's , rendezvous of the pigtailed folk in Madrid . Young Tano Ruiz had come in with his two brothers . They had sent over a bottle of champagne , and Pacote had to reciprocate by inviting them to his table . Tano hoped he would have " the honor of performing on the same bill with the maestro , " and Pacotereminded him that he was retired . Then it was clever the way they did it . Somehow they rigged the conversationso that soon one brother was on his feet announcing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared to appear in the same ring with Tano and that Pacote was afraid of Miuras . This last charge was not completelyunfounded , for " the bulls of death " had killed seven famous matadors , including his uncle ; Pacote remem/bered as a child his uncle dying in their house after three months with drains in his hip ; he remembered the stench and the screaming . Once during the bloody century of Miura breeding , all the bullfighters had banded together and formed a pact never to accept animals from that stable . Pacote had only fought them once and had done badly . But here in the cafe , although he had tried to control himself , knowing that the Ruiz brothers were just trying to goad him into a lucrative and prestige-making fight , all he knew was that he was being insulted in front of Socorro and all the people in the restaurant and that he was a better and more honest torero than this young punk would ever be . He did what they wanted him to do , played right into their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have stopped him , but Chaves was n't there . When he found out , it was too late , for the newspapers had it  --  the Ruiz clan had seen to that . So now Pacote drank and poured another . He lurched across the room , putting the bottle on the bedside table , and flopped down on the bed , his eyes tightly closed , his head buried in the pillow , his whole body shuddering . The dog came over and licked his face , and Pacote pushed it away . He opened one eye and saw a spot on the bed , a brown burn spot . He whirled and looked up at the ceiling and that damned fly was still there . " Fly ? " he said , his voice going up at the end . Then " Fly ! " with his voice going down on the end . Then : " Flyfly , " very quickly . He gave a groan-laugh . Lola Flores was giving the final bleats of her song : " Tellme , woman , when a love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back his fist and shot it into the radio . His hand smashed through the lattice work and cloth of the speaker and the music stopped , but the light was still on and it hummed . He swept it off the table and it crashed to the floor . He wanted to shout . He did shout , muffling it in the pillow . Then he took the pillow and flung it at the fly on the ceiling . He did n't hit it , but the draft dislodged the fly , and it spiraled down , a dry shell . It had been dead for some time . " That 's me , " he said . He gave one laugh . " Dead as a hammer and clinging , clinging , clinging , cling ... " Through the fog he heard a knock on the door . " A moment ! " he mumbled . His thoughts were swirling in strange , slow patterns , like cream when it 's poured in iced coffee , but he was n't quite over the brink . He lay on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in his mouth , his tongue controlling the flow of the liquid , the bottle gurgling happily , his Adam 's apple bobbing . When it was empty he gasped : " All right ! " Chaves came in . " Well , she gone ? We 've only got about an hour . Got to do a fast job of ... " Pacote propped himself up on his elbows . " Hola , Pepe , " he said foolishly . " Pepe , what d' ya think ? " The words tumbled over one another in slow motion . " I 'm a fly on the wall and I 'm dead and I 'm clinging just the same . " Chaves groped behind him for a chair and sagged slowly into it . Pacote winked as though imparting a fine secret . " Dead as a hammer , " he whispered confidentially , " but hanging on , hanging on . "  |p88Chaves  could only stare in fascinated horror . " Oh God , " he breathed , " oh God . " " Y'know , " Pacote said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what the American said . El Pimpi is a centaur , and I 'm the god of the dance . Never knew that , did you ? And Pepe Chaves is a wood sprite who hides in dark places at the base of a tree and looks out with eyes as big as a toad 's . Looks out to see if he can find a little gangrenefor his dinner . And that 's not fair , all the gangrenein the forest belongs to me , me , old Paco Gangrene , the god of the dance . " Pepe mopped his brow and wiped his fat neck with the wig . " That bitch , " he said . " Oh , that crab-laden bitch . " Then he sprang into action . He barked orders into the telephone for coffee and food . He went into the bathroom and ran the cold water in the bath . " Get up , you bastard . " He helped Pacote up from the bed . He put his arm around him and started him for the bathroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk , " Pacote mumbled . " Walk ! " Pepe commanded , and Pacote started his legs going . " Amigo de mi arma , " Pacote said , patting Chaves 's fat stomach . " Friend of my soul , you fight today . The Miuras will give you the old high colonic ' stead of me . " " That bitch , " Pepe said . " Oh , that bitch . " Pacote tenderly stroked the bald head as he walked . " Don Jose Chaves , father of ten and hero of the battle of Trafalgar . Ole for Don Jose Chaves . " In the bathroom , Chaves stripped the dressing gown off him.  | " Get in , " he said , pushing Pacote down to a sitting position on the edge of the bathtub . " Jose Chaves , my friend , your friend , defender of the weak , righter of wrongs ... " " Get in , " commanded Chaves. " ... hater of lies , enemy of castration , deflowerer of ... " " Get in ! " " ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tub and gasped at its shock . He lay in it limply . How does it go , Pepe ? " he mourned . " A man 's love forwoman waxes and wanes like the moon , but  --  but a man 's love for his brother , how does it go , Pepe ? " Chaves put his hand on top of Pacote 's head and shoved him under . " Is as steadfast as the stars , " he said mechanically , holding him there . He let him up spluttering and gagging when he heard t Ile knock on the door . It was the waiter . " No way to treat the god of the dance , " Pacote muttered reproachfully , as Chaves brought the tray into the bathroomand put it on the stool . Flipping the lid down on the toilet , Chaves sat down . He started to reach over toward the tub , but Pacote saw it coming and obediently slid underthe water holding his nose . When he came up , Chaves shoved a large cup of coffee at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chaves growled . " Drink ! " Pacote took the cup shakily . " Pepe , I 've been to Biarritz , you know . " " Yes , sure , you 're a gardenia , " said Chaves . " A regular gardenia . Drink ! " Between immersions , Chaves fed him the small pot ofp90coffee and the steak . And then he fed him another pot , Pacote coughing , protesting , spewing some of it up . In twenty minutes he was able to get out of the tub , dry himself , and make it into the other room under his own power . He was still drunk , but he was sober enough to realize that he was drunk and to be afraid because of it . The telephone rang , and the concierge said that the newspapermen wanted to come up . Chaves snapped , " Not yet , " and hung up . He handed Pacote the white cotton underwear , and he got into it . It came to his knees and elbows . There was a knock on the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in timidly , puttingeach foot down as though apologizing to the carpet for stepping on it . He was a little sparrow of a man who bowed several times and otherwise gave evidence of his pleasure at being the honored one selected to shave the great Pacote before his last fight . Pacote sat down , and the barber readied his instruments . He sloshed up a lather and began to shave him , but he had trouble accomplishing his mission because Pacote 's head kept lolling . When he left , Chaves sighed . " Well , let 's call it off , " he said quietly , " It never should have been anyway . " " Like hell , " said Pacote . " We 'll just say you 're sick . " " Like hell . I 'm all right . " He started to fumble on the long white stockings . Suarez , the swordhandler , stuck his monkey head in the door . " It 's about time ! " exclaimed Chaves . " U'te ' perdone , " said Suarez , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dropped to his knees in front of Pacote . He skillfully pulled on the cotton stockings , smoothing them up the long , slightly bowed legs . Then the rose stockings went over them . Pacote stood up and took up the white silk pants heavy with the crusted gold designs . He swayed and almost fell as he tried to balance to get one leg into the pants . " Mata'or , " said the wizened little man , his eyes pinched with fear . " You 're not going to fight like this ? " " Like what , you whoreson ? " He had never spoken roughly to a menial before in his life . " Shut up and get me into this filthy taleguilla . " The little man swallowed , but he supported Pacote while the other leg was guided into the pants . " Just say the word , Pacote , " said Chaves , " and I 'll call Manolo Belmonte and tell him that ... " " Shut up and grab . " Chaves took one side of the high pants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worried his narrow hips so that the crotch of the skin-tight pants was right . Then he sat down on the bed and extended his legs while Chaves and Suarez did up the complicated strings and tassels at the knee  --  the machos had to be just right , tight without hindering the leg action . Pacote usually put in his own cuff links and studs to give him something distracting to do . But his hands were shakingtoo much , so Suarez did it . He had just buttoned the pleated shirt and knotted the thin red tie when the telephone on the wall rang . Chaves grabbed it . " Diga , " he grunted impatiently . " Si.  |p92diga  , si , si , si , al aparato . " Then he covered the mouthpieceand said to Pacote . " I think it 's going to be your senora madre from San Sebastian . " " Good Christ , " breathed Pacote . " Do you want to talk to her ? " " Christ , no . " " Go ahead , San Sebastian , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone he reserved for priests and older women : " Si , senora , si ! How are you ? Certainly he 's all right . He 's fine , very calm . No , he 's not here at the moment . He ... " Pacote walked over to him unsteadily . " Just a minute , senora , here he is now . " " Hola , Mama ? " Pacote tried to keep his voice controlledand low . " How is San Sebastian ? What ? I do n't hear you very well . Oh . Oh . Oh . Well , that 's good . Yes , it 's fine here , too . No . No wind , a Dios gracias . No , I have n't seen the bulls , but I hear they are very little . No , honestly , Pepe said they are real pollywogs . And horns like bananas . I sound differently ? It 's a bad connection . " Suarez was kneeling and sliding Pacote 's feet into the black slippers as he talked . " Yes , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop crying , Mama , for God 's sake , there 's nothing to cry about . You read it in the papers did n't you ? This is the last one . And I 'm going to stay a mile away from the cattle . Yes , Pepe will call you from the plaza , and I 'll see you in a week on the ranch . Stop crying , for God 's sake . " And then on an impulse , because he knew it would please her , he added : " And Mama  --  she  --  she wo n't be there . "  |p93After  he had hung up , the image of the good fat woman with the tragic face and the same heavy-lidded eyes as his made him feel like crying for a moment , and he did n't know why . Chaves gave him the red sash . Pacote held one end against his waist and spun slowly into Chaves , who pulled on the other end . After the sash was on , he sat down , and Suarez clipped the velvet button and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of Pacote 's head . The pigtail had been made two years ago from Socorro 's brown hair for luck , and it looked almost blond against the blue-blackness of Pacote 's wet hair . The telephone rang . Chaves took it angrily , then turned to Pacote . " The concierge says there 's a bunch down there who are hollering to come up and watch you dress . Salazarfrom the A.B.C . and some foreign newspaperman and K-Hito and that American and the Marques of Aracena and the rest . " " Tell them I 'm already dressed and to go hell . " He put on the embroidered vest . " Water . " Suarez brought him a glass from the bathroom . It was the one that the whiskey had been in , and the smell made him think he might throw up . But he drank it . Never had he been so dry , fear-dry and whiskey-dry . It was as though he had brushed his teeth with mucilage ; it was an actual effort to open his mouth or swallow . Pepe helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful thing , the gold designs clustered in simple flower patterns on the white silk . The suit was old now , and here Ind there was the shadow of a stubborn bloodstain , especiallyaround the waist where the bull 's shoulder hadp94brushed by , but it had taken Casa Manfredi three months to make and was the finest they 'd ever turned out . Pacote ran his hands down his thighs and the heavy metallic feel of the brocade was good . He felt more like a torero now , more like Pacote than he had in his skinny nakedness half an hour before . Everything he had looked better in the uniform ; his wide shoulders , the nonexistent hips and behind and even the saber legs made him a taurine tailor 's dream . Matagatos came in without knocking . He was dressed in his uniform , a cheap version of Pacote 's , only blue . " El Buick is in front . How goes it , Pacorro ? Not much time . " " Bien , bien , " said Pacote . The older man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was affection and respect there that always made him like himself better . He did n't want Matagatos to see he had been drinking . He turned away and went to the bureau and lit the thick candlein the votive glass . He knew he was swaying a little . Chaves looked at his watch and jerked his head to the others . " Vamonos ya ! " " A la lucha " announced Matagatos solemnly . " To the battle ! " " Do you always have to say that ? " Pacote snarled . Matagatos always said it and Pacote hated the expression . " Sorry , Pacorro , but let 's get going . " Suarez took the tooled leather sword case from the closet , and he and the banderillero went out . Chaves hesitatedat the door . " Paquito , " he began hesitantly , " let 's call it off , eh ? You 're in no shape to  --  " " Get out of here ! " Pacote said.  |p95When  Chaves was gone and he was all alone , he dropped his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while and then dragged them away , and it felt as though his flesh would pull off from under his fingers . He could hear the racket in the street  --  loud now , the cries , the honkings , the vendors , the rattle of carriage wheels over cobbles , the harsh clang of the extra streetcars . He , Pacote Torres , was responsible for all this excitement . On the dresser in the center was the little gold triptych of the Virgen de la Marcarena , and the candle flickered in front of it . Pacote crossed himself and stood before it simply , devoutly , believing , the palms of his hands together . He had always been embarrassed by any more elaborateprocedures . " Most saintly of Virgins , " he said , " I do n't ask to be good today . This is not like the other days . I only ask that they come out easy , that they do n't snag me , that I may live and be able to worship you . Just let me live . Amen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cross against his forefinger . He blew out a long sigh . Picking up the kinky montera off the chair , he held it in both hands by its knobs and dipped his head into it . He pressed it down with the palm of his hand until it came level with his thick eyebrows . He took a handkerchief out of the drawer and put it in the little slit pocket in the side of his jacket . He patted the dog . And then because it did n't have long to live and had brought him luck for so many years , he held it to him convulsively , hugging it to his chest withp96tears in his eyes , not really for the dog but for everything . " Al , dear Compadre , how you stink . " Then he was as ready as he would ever be . He took the folded dress cape , slung it over his forearm , and left the room . And now it was the time , the real time , the terrible time , the sick-making time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a monsoon.  |p97HE  WALKED down the one flight , and the thick carpet felt soft under his slippered feet . He almost stumbled once , but he caught himself and made it the rest of the way down all right . There were little knots of people in the big crowded lobby ; and he spotted the flash of color of Matagatosand Cascabel , the other banderillero . They were talking to Chaves and the newspapermen and smoking hard . As he started for them , the crowd saw him and broke into spontaneous applause . It was sincere . Because this was his last and because he 'd been great and honest torero . He nodded to them and held himself erect and was careful how he walked ; he was still tight physically , though he was thinking almost sober . Some flash bulbs went off , but he could n't see from where . People were saying things to him as he pushed through the crowd , but he did n't bother to hear them . The bull critics around Chaves greeted him respectfully , and Pacote reciprocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never have to sweat about these affable vultures again . And hep98knew that no matter how much Chaves had paid them they would write the truth today , for it was his last , and they knew that next season there 'd be no little envelopes with big bills in them sent over before the fight . " Historic day today , " wheezed Salazar , a great untidy blob of a man . " A great day and a sad day . " " It 's the fiesta brava 's greatest loss , Maestro , " said Caminoof the Sevilla " Hoy , " rubbing the palm of one hand over the knuckles of the other . " Es verdad , " said the pale foreign correspondent . Pacote knew he was English by his friendly lack of ease and his bad Spanish . " Mucho . " What did one answer to asinine remarks like that ? He felt like saying something startling like : Have you attacked your grandmother again since I last saw you ? But he knew anything he said would be drunken talk so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his arm , and with Matagatos on the other side and Cascabel in front , he was convoyed out of the hotel . He heard murmurs of " Suerte , suerte " from all the people , and he thought : You bastards , you do n't want me to have luck . You just want you to get a thrill out of my risking my neck , want to see me spill my blood . The big blue station wagon they 'd brought back from Mexico was waiting in front , the canvas basket with the folded capes strapped to the grill on top . Suarez , the sword handler , was at the wheel . Casabel held open the paneled door of the back seat . Pacote edged in , sat down stiffly and cautiously because of the tightness of the costume , and then folded in his longp99legs . Chaves climbed in on the other side . Cascabel closed the door , got in front , and they drove off jerkily ; Suarez had n't yet mastered the subtleties of " el Buick . " " Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's see if you can get us to the plaza without killing us , eh ? I know it 's at least five hundred yards away , but let 's just see if you can make it . Watch those uncles in the street , eh ? We do n't mind widowing their women , but let 's not dent the car . " The boulevard , dead an hour ago , was now filled with mobs of people and taxi-carriages and Italian and French cars all heading down the wide tree-lined Pasco de Colon toward the Plaza de Toros . Most of the men wore dark suits , white shirts buttoned at the throat , and no ties . Some wore black sombreros Cordobeses , the broad brim tipped over one eye and a toothpick in the band . Mu ' flamenco . Some of the women in the carriages wore mantillas and snapped their fans open and closed . But there were n't many of those because it was not fair time . However , there was more excitement in the air than any regular Feria fight could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some patted the fenders and rapped on the window and shouted , " Luck , Luck ! " " A los toros ! " men called across the street to each other jubilantly . " To the bulls ! " The car drove slowly by the open bodegas where the aficionados were gulping down their cafe con leche or a last manzanilla or filling their leather wine bottles . They would look up when the station wagon went by and yell :  | " Ole to madre ! " or " Suerte , Matador ! " One held up a bottle and pointed to the label to show he was drinking " Anis Pacote , " and Matagatos chuckled . Matagatos was n't going to risk his neck ; he could chuckle . " Que tal ? " asked Chaves quietly . " How are you going it now ? " Pacote waggled his hand . " Regular , regular . " " Are you still  --  " Chaves did n't want to embarrass him in front of the two banderilleros  --  " How do you feel ? " " Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the order switched so you do n't fight first . " " I do n't want any favors from that uncle . " " It 's no favor . He 'll be glad to do it . " " I heard what you told Solorzano . About cutting them down . Do n't like him , do n't like that uncle . " " I 'm  --  I 'm sorry you overheard all that manure . " Chaves frowned . " It was just a lot of manure I was talking . You 're in the best shape of your life . " Pacote snorted air out through his nose in answer . " I do n't like Solorzano either , " said Chaves , " but we need him today you know , to  --  to sort of play safe . He 'll cut them down for us . I 'm sorry you heard all that stuff . " " Do n't like him . He did n't do anything when you pissed on him . Nothing . When you called him a butcher he did n't do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him turn color . " " Like litmus paper , " said Chaves . " But I 'm sorry you had to hear all that hay . " " Sure , like litmus . But he just took it . Just took it . " " The crowd 's going to kill him today for ruining the bulls . He 'll turn color when the crowd pisses on him . "  | " The crowd 's going to kill me today . Watch them piss on me today . " " No , they 'll blame it on him . You 'll be all right . Do n't worry about what the crowd thinks . Just get through . Just keep thinking about the ranch and that parlor of yours and the fish in the pond and your mother and about getting drunk tonight . Remember what Belmonte said about the crowd . Keep remembering that . " " Jesus , Jesus , " Pacote breathed . The fear and the whiskey and the motion of the car and the quick stops for the pedestrians was making him sick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be terrible if he threw up . He had always been so calm before , the one who made everyone else feel there was nothing to fear . He talked to distract himself . " And how goes the great Cascabel ? " he said . " How goes the great Desperdicios ? " Cascabel turned around in the front seat . He grinned , but he was suffering . " Fine , Pacorro , fine . " He was young for a banderillero  --  Pacote 's age  --  and he was a good kid . He had wanted to be a matador , but he had wanted to be a matador more than he had wanted to do the things a matador must do , and it should be the other way around . He had semi-flopped in his presentation as a novillero in Madrid nine years ago . He hated to kill and disliked the responsibility of being the head man , and , besides , he had no guts with anything but a perfect animal . He could have gone on to be a mediocre matador , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacote fight for the first time , he said , " Here is genius , and I have no business claiming the same title as he has . " But he could n't stayp102away from the bulls , and he liked putting in the sticks , so he joined Pacote 's cuadrilla as a banderillero and thought he was lucky to get with the new " fenomeno . " He 'd been with him all this time , through " the alternative " when he became a senior matador , Mexico and Peru both times , and now the last . " There 's no wind , anyway , " said Pacote . " It 's a good day anyway . Good as bread . " " No , " said Cascabel , grinning . " No wind to frig the cloth . " God , this uncle could grin at anything . If they were going to hang him , he 'd grin because they 'd left the price tag on the rope . " What are you going to do after today ? " Pacote asked . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I d-do n't know . " He had a slight speech impediment that became more pronounced when he was scared . " I might go with young Juanito Belmonte . " " You can do better than that , Desperdicios . " He called him that affectionately because in the old days there was a very brave fighter who had the same last name as Cascabel . Once in a fight the bull 's horn had gouged out the man 's eye , and as it was lying on his cheek he had casually reached up , jerked it all the way off , flicked it away , and gone on fighting ; the people afterwards always called him " Desperdicios "  --  Cast-off-scrap-of-meat . " I can help you do better than that . " " I d-do n't know . Everyone seems to have his cuadrilla set up . " " You 're a great doctor of the barbs . You could go with Tano Ruiz. "  |p103Cascabel  made the noise of spitting , though his mouth was too dry to actually produce anything . " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be smart and quit ? " " I 'd sure as hell like to quit right this minute . But after the fight , I wo n't want to quit . When I s-sit around Los Corales and get drunk , I 'll think it 's the greatest g-goddamnthing in the world . The day before the fight I always get so scared I call up my brother-in-law and say all right , I 'll take that job wholesaling salami right after this last fight , and then after the fight I always call him up , and insult him and tell him to take his job and his s-s-salami and s-s-stuff it . But God , how I 'm suffering now . How we suffer , eh , Paco ? Why do we do it ? " Pacote held up his hand and rubbed his thumb and forefingertogether significantly . " N-no , " said Cascabel . " It must be more than that . It 's got to be more than that . " Yes , thought Pacote , it had to be a hell of a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a narrowstreet and pushed through the people up a cobbled alley , and then they were in back of the Plaza de Toros . Suarez stopped the car and they got out . Suarez and a mozo waiting there stood on the running board to get the cape basket down . There was a crowd milling around to see the matadors arrive , and Cascabel had to shove a wedge through them up to the great gate . Chaves beat on the gate with his fat fist . Immediately a little door cut into the larger one opened cautiously and then all the way when the beady eye saw who it was . Pacotep104tripped on the high sill and almost fell , but Chaves caught him . " You ca n't fight this way , chico , " he hissed . " Hell I ca n't ! I 'll be all right after the first bull . " The photographers were in the little courtyard , and the No-Do newsreel camera began grinding away . Pacote stopped off at the latrine . When he came out the photographerswere heading for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patio de caballos . The shaded courtyard was taut and quiet and precisely active compared to the frenetic wantonness of the outside . The four picadors , both Tano 's and Pacote 's , were near their nags lengthening stirrups , adjusting the peto mattress on the animals ' right side , being boosted on . Fat Solorzano was complaining about his mount . The drag mules with F their red and yellow plumes were being hitched to the whiffletree . The men in the butchering section were donningwhite aprons and sharpening knives already . There was the smell of urine and cigar smoke and fear in the air . Solorzano and the other picador , El Pimpi , nodded unsmilinglyto their matador , and Pacote acknowledged it by raising his eyebrows . He followed Chaves toward the big tunnel that led under the stands and under all the people in the cheap sunny section of the ring . Suarez passed them carrying the sword case and the Indian-red water jug and towels around his neck . Behind him trotted the mozo in canvas sandals , running with his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his left shoulder . Pacote wanted to stop Suarez and get a drink of water  --  God , he was dry  --  but it would be too conspicuous ; go/ing to the latrine was bad enough . And anyway Suarez was already through the cuadrilla gate and into the ring , going down the alleyway behind the fence to the shady side of the stands . Thev said old Lagartijo was able to spit copiouslybefore going into the ring to show his contempt for fear , but they were liars . " You 'd better hurry if you 're going in there , " Chaves said . Tano Ruiz 's men were coming out of the door to the little tiled room fitted out like a chapel . " I 'm not going , " he said , " it 's done . " He did n't want to be alone again . Chaves handed him a lighted cigarette , and Pacote took it gratefully and sucked on it , holding it cupped in his hand as though hiding it . He had just gone to the latrine , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Buenas tardes , " a voice said . " Good afternoon , mata-dor . " Nino de Ronda came out of the chapel . Pacote had almost forgotten about Nino de Ronda . He was dressed in a wretched purple and black costume that was frayed and stained and had been clumsily let out to accommodate the large bump of stomach . He had his montera in his hand and the bald head glistened . He had n't even enough fringe in back to clip the anadido to , so he had tied a wide black ribbon around his head and hung the pigtail from that . It looked ridiculous . " Christ in His pain ! " Pacote exploded . He reached out and grabbed the pigtail and jerked it off and flung it on the ground . " Are you out to make me look like a fool ? " Nino de Ronda hung his head like a small boy and mum/bled something about being sorry he did n't have any hair to clip a pigtail on to . Pacote snatched the montera out of the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take it easy , " Chaves warned . " The ribbon wo n't show with his montera on . " Pacote was quivering , and he needed to drink water and he needed to make water , and it felt as though the skin had been peeled from every nerve in his body . He strode away back up the passageway and around the corner to the latrine . He was afraid he might let go when the trumpet sounded for the bull . Was n't so bad if you had a dark traje de luces on , but it would be disaster with this white silk . He saw the gate he had come in , and he thought how easy it would be to slip out and run , run anywhere , run to the ranch , run to Mexico where he was treated like a king , run to Peru , run to Buenos Aires where no one knew him , just run , hide . After relieving himself and adjusting the complexities of the costume , he went back to the cuadrilla gate . Tano Ruiz was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see his gold and green costume , new and stiff and tight over his woman 's behind . " Hola , " said Tano as Pacote came up . Pacote nodded . He was fighting the urge to yawn , the sign that one is really scared . " Chaves here wants me to fight first , " said Tano in his precise way . " But I just ca n't see any sense in it . " He always held his humorless mouth askew as though shaving or as though he was biting the inside of it . He was tanned and too good looking and as sure of himself as a middle/weight champion . He was only twenty , but his father had started him fighting professionally when he was ten as a becerrista  --  a calf-fighter  --  and then he was the top novillerofor two years before he took the alternative . Two years as a senior matador had given him great command and poise and a hard pair of eyes that belied his unmanly , almost effeminate face . " But hell , what 's your objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one-twenty . You ought to be glad to get rid of that one-twenty . " " The bulls are n't the point , " said Tano . He always frowned as he strove for intense earnestness . " It 's just that Pacote is the senior sword and as such he should fight first . " " But this is a mano a mano , and it does n't matter ! He is n't going to have to kill someone else 's bull . If it were a regular fight with three matadors it would be different . " Tano shook his head . " I just ca n't see it . " Chaves 's voice was trembling . " Listen , Ruiz , if you want me to beg , I 'm begging . Not fighting first is terribly important to us . Paco 's not feeling well . " " Yes , " Tano grinned . " I can smell his sickness . " " Ruiz , I 'm begging you . Let . . . " " Christ , Pepe , " Pacote broke in , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a bolt shoot back , and the cuadrilla gate was suddenly opened , and the sun flashed in where they were standing . It was so bright Pacote could n't see for a minute . He shook out his dress cape , also white silk with gold leaves and flowers . Draping it over his left shoulder , he gathered the ends around his waist and clutched them withp108his left hand , the arm resting in the folds like a sling . He stepped forward into the mouth of the gate , and now he could see the dazzling golden sand , finely crushed rock , really , which only the M aestranza plaza had . He could see the whole shady side of the plaza and part of the sunny side , and it was jammed with fifteen thousand people . There it was , the Big Circle , eager to swallow him . He worked his feet back and forth in the sand like a boxer and dropped the cigarette and stepped on it carefully , feeling it under the thin-soled slipper . Matagatos lined up in back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cascabel . And behind he heard the clatter of the four picadors ' horses corning down the inclined passageway , skidding a bit on the cobbles . Behind them would be the four mules and the monosabios  --  the " wise  --  monkeys " to manage them . The two " alguaciles "  --  the constables  --  pushed their horses down the passageway to the front of the men . They were fancily dressed in black velvet and plumed hats and were mounted on identical gray Arabian geldings . " Drinking your courage these days , Don Paco ? " said Tano Ruiz . He moved up next to Pacote on his right as junior " sword , " and his cuadrilla fell into place behind him . " Drinking your eggs ? " Mother of God , was he that obviously tight ? There was nothing to answer . Pacote twisted his head away to look up at the big clock set up above the boxes , and as he did there was the heralding of a bugle . The two alguaciles immediately started out into the ring in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow , curvetting sideways , fussing with their bits . Theyp109stopped in front of the presidente of the program while the senior constable theoretically caught in his hat a symbolic key to the gate that would release the bulls . They backed their horses all the way across the ring to head the parade of bullfighters again and people clapped for their performance . Then there was a crash of cymbals , and the band burst out with the first notes of " La Morena de Mi Copla . " " Well , there 's the wet-your-pants song , " said Tano calmly . " I do n't see any reason why we should n't start this thing . " He looked eager for the fight to begin . God , thought Pacote , I can remember when I could hardly wait for them to begin . I can remember when I was fifteen swimming across the river at night with Matagatos , our clothes on top of our heads . We could hardly wait to get down to the ranches . If it was moonlight , fine . If not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see us . And then we 'd cape the hell out the big novillos with a couple of my father 's old capes and never worry much about what would happen if we stumbled on that rough terrain in the middle of a pass with no one around to help . We did n't know enough to be scared then . We did n't worry about the bulls then , only eating . And the time we were coming back that night and bumped into the gypsy girl . She was the first . She was only fourteen , but she was already a woman and muy cachonda , and we took turns with her .. . and ... And it was Pepe 's voice hoarse and loud . " Vimonos ! " Chaves was saying as he ducked out of their way into the callejon passageway . " Let 's go ! "  |p111PACOTE  led off automatically with his left foot , and Tano was in step with him , and the crowd burst into a roar as they strode out into the arena . Photographers were in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out black papers from in back of the cameras and snapping again . A couple of flash bulbs blinked white in the bright sun , and Pacote let himself dwell on the why of this until he reached mid-ring . Then he swung to the right a bit , Tano parallel to him with his head up and flashing the big smile he reserved for audiences . The two constables headed for the " presidente 's " box , the cuadrillas followed , and the No  --  Do newsreel camera behind the fence swung along with them . Pacote walked as always , head down , straight-backed , his right arm bowed out from his body , three fingers graspinga bit of cuff . So many novilleros were trying to copy that entrance . He walked a little as though his feet hurt him and there was a slight rocking motion , and yet it was graceful  --  not the easy , unconscious grace of Tano Ruiz  --   |p112but  a stiff , regal grace . There was no cockiness there , nor was there feigned modesty , but only habitual confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Look at that uncle , " said Chaves to Suarez . He had hurried around the ring behind the rust-red fence and was now watching the cuadrillas coming toward him . " Look at him ! He walks like a frigging king . I taught him how to walk like that . " It was as though he 'd never really noticed Pacote 's walk before , or was trying to get a last clear impression , so that he would have a sharp image when he consulted his memory in the future . " Look at him , " Chaves said . " Drunk or sober , nobody else ever walked like that . " But Suarez was too busy to look , too occupied in unpacking the capes and fitting the short notched dowels into the muletas . The men were up to the fence now in the shade , and , looking up at the presidente of the program , they made a slight bow . The presidente today was the civil governor , and sitting on either side of him to advise him were Juan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffly , his hand on his montera , and then he went to the fence , shedding the dress cape as he did . Suddenly he remembered . He had n't clipped Belmonte 's medal onto the neck chain ; it was sitting back in the hotel in his pants pocket . " Don Eduardo ? " asked Chaves reaching over the fence and taking the little ornate cape . " I do n't care , " said Pacote . " Sure . Don Eduardo . " It bothered him about the medallion . In his semi-drunkenness , it bothered him greatly.  |p113Chaves  went down the passageway till he came to where Eduardo Miura was sitting in the front row . He handed the cape up to him , and Miura smiled broadly and spread it out on the railing in front of him . The parade was over , the monos were cracking their whips behind the mules as they went through the gate fast , and the picadors were jogging their nags out , when suddenlythe band swung into the pasodoble " Pacote . " The entire plaza stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hats and everyone was applauding . " It 's for you , chico , " said Chaves . " Go out . " " Christ in His pain , " Pacote said . But he took a few uncertain steps away from the fence and doffed his montera . He started to turn back , but the applause swelled and Chaves was waving him out with his hand , saying , " A los medios , a los medios . " He walked out a little further to the edge of the shade and stopped . But the people began to chant , " A los medios ! " in unison , so he walked out into the sun to the very center . Unsmiling and swearing under his breath , he pivoted slowly , his head bowed , the sun making the gray streak in his hair look white . It will be great if I vomit out here now , he thought . He looked over at the sunny side of the ring and saw a large sign painted on cloth hanging down saying " Club Pacote of Madrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruiz after today , he thought . As he walked back , many people were singing the words to the pasodoble along with the band :  | " Pacote , Pacote , greatest torero .. . From the region of the caliphs you came to become the caliph of bullfighting .... " And he was moved and ashamed , ashamed of being tight , ashamed of what he was going to do this afternoon . He could never fight down his guilty sense of obligation to an audience , people who had actually paid money to see him  --  him , Paco Torres , who had been so poor and frail and had run home to his mother with his first money , five whole pesetas that he had made pitching manure . And now they were applauding him , telling him they were grateful for the hundreds of afternoons of emocion he had giventhem with his guts and skill , hoping this last one , too , would exhilarate them and give them something to talk about in the cafes and make them say to their grandchildren , But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a real uncle ! " As he came back to the fence , the audience and the other toreros and the ring servants were still applauding , and Chaves had his dark glasses off and was dabbing at his eyes with his wig . Pacote cleared his throat and swallowed . " And what 's the matter with you , onion head , " he said as he put on the montera . " I got a piece of manure in my eye , " said Chaves . The music stopped , and Suarez handed Pacote the big folded magenta fighting cape . He dragged it over the fence and swirled it open on the sand , holding an end with onep116hand . He flipped it over slowly to the yellow side with his name stenciled on it and then back again to get the feel of it . The way he handled it , it looked like part of him . It looked as though he 'd never had one out of his hands . Tano Ruiz was fifteen feet away swinging his cape in the veronica pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lots of salt , " said Suarez , contemptuously . " A real salt shaker , that uncle . " " My aunt Sinforosa looks good without a bull too , " said Chaves , clapping on his wig and spitting . " What conceit we have here . That uncle 's so conceited I 'll bet he cuts his name out of the telephone book and pastes it in his scrap album . " The banderilleros had tried out their capes and retreated behind the fence . Pacote gathered the cape to him , huggingit , and slid into the passageway through the burladero opening that was big enough for a man but too small for a bull . " Now take him wide and safe , " Chaves said coming up next to him , and resting his elbows on the fence . " Solorzano will , cut him down for you . Take him plenty wide till Solorzano gets at him with the iron . " " God , I wish I were fighting second . " Pacote leaned against the fence weakly , and his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little pearls of sweat stood out on his upper lip . " I do n't feel good . I feel rotten . " The ring was empty now , terribly and completely empty , a circle of sparkling golden sand waiting to blot upp117his blood . The drum rolled and the crowd hushed . The bugle bleated out , cracking on the last note , the rope that went to the latch was jerked , and the toril door swung open . Nothing happened . Cascabel , safely behind the fence , swung his cape several times in front of the dark tunnel . Suddenly a greenishblackshape exploded from the darkness and skidded out into the sun . Babilonio , number 55 branded big on his side , was low in the haunches , swelling up to great shoulders and the angry hump of tossing muscle . The dust from the corral blew off the muscled back as it ran fast around the empty ring , feinting with its horns and looking for something to kill . It had not been goaded or irritated or injured in any way  --  not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which most other plazas jabbed into the bull 's shoulders  --  yet it knew what it was in this arena for . It was a Toro Bravo , a separate breed from the domestic bovine , and its natural instinct , plus centuries of careful breeding behind it , told it that it was here to fight and kill . It had n't eaten this day , any more than the men who were to fight it had , but its fat barrel and sleek hide showed that all its life it had had plenty of the best food . Though it was fairly small , the audience applauded the bull 's conformation , the small hoofs , the uniform horns , the silky tail that almost touched the ground . It could turn faster than a polo pony and beat any race horse in the world for a hundred feet . Here was a good example of the most perfect living instrument for killing that man could devise.  |p118Tano  Ruiz moved quickly down the passageway toward Pacote , his cape in his hands . " I 'll take this bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to fight second , I 'll take it ! " Pacote nodded with no expression . " I like his style , " said Tano . " Take the bastard then , " said Pacote . Tano motioned to his banderillero nearest the bull , and the man slipped out through a burladero . He came up in back of the bull holding the big cape out in front of him like a shield . " Huh , huh , " the man grunted , " Huh , toro ! " The bull whirled and charged . As it did , the banderillero let go of the cape with one hand , jumping back out of the way . Bent over and with no attempt at style he trailed the cape in front of the bull 's lowered horns . He was paid only to make his matador look good , not to take any chances himself . Two more charges , the man changing hands each time and giving ground . Tano 's old-young eyes were studying every move and hook of the bull . A bull generallyfavors one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn it feinted with and which it killed with . " Enough ! " he yelled . The banderillero dropped his cape and vaulted the fence . Tano went into the ring , dancing out sideways like a crab and calling , " Hoooiii , toro , hoooiii ! " The bull was staring over the fence at where the banderillerohad left the ring.  | " Tapate ! " Tano yelled out of the corner of his mouth , not taking his gaze off the bull . " Hide yourself , man ! " The people in the passageway crouched down out of sight . " Toro , hooii , " Tano called again as he danced sideways . When he saw that the bull had focused on him , he stopped dancing . He shook the cape standing profiled to the animal and holding his arms like a boxer , the left way out in front of the right . The bull dropped its head and charged . Tano took a step forward , one knee bent , the other leg straight and swung the cape in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air as it hurtled by , jumping a bit , the horns two yards from the man 's body . The animal wheeled at the end of its charge , the front legs braced and the back legs trotting its body around as though independently operated . It lunged back again , and Tano waited for it a little straighter , letting the horn go by a little closer . The crowd was silent . They knew the torero was taking the bull at a safe distance to get the first jumps out of it , to let it know that here was its enemy and to make it settle down to a straight , predictable charge . Now the bull had stopped charging and was staring , a little bewilderedly , at this strange creature that had eluded its horns . In its four-year existence it had only encountered a dismounted man once , and that was when it was less than two years old at the ranch " tienta " where it was tested briefly for bravery . Tano stepped back away from the bull and changed hisp120grip on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly different angle , standing straight , his back arched , the cape partly in front of his body . " Hooi , toro , " he chanted as he advanced , " Hooiii , hooi . " He shook the cape to focus the bull 's attention on it and not on his body . The bull measured , wagged its horns , and lowering itsp121head , charged hard . Tano offered it the heavy cloth , dropping his right hand , which was out ahead of the left , down as the horns almost hit the cape , and then moving both hands along together to guide the bull 's course . He did n't slide his feet back out of the path of the charge , so the left horn went by a yard from his knees.  |p122A  few scattered " Oles " came from the crowd , but they were waiting for more than this : Sevilla prided itself on being what the gypsies called " Servalavari , the Cradle of Bullfighting , " and the toughest audience in the world . Tano crowded the bull from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calling harshly , " Hooi , hooi , hooi ! " and incited it for a quick return charge . " Hooi , hooi , hooi , " he called as he shook the cape invitingly . This time he held his hands closer to his body and brought the horn by his knees two feet away . The next charge was a foot and a half away and brought a solid shout of " Ole " from the easier-to-please cheap section of the ring . He finished off the series of veronicas with an attempt at a whirling serpentina , but as the cape swirled over the bull 's head , it tangled on a horn and did n't blossom out around his waist the way it should have . " What a shame , " Chaves grunted . " And he did it so pretty without a bull . " The animal had charged many times without hitting anything solid . It was winded , and in following the cape in the serpentina pass it had wrenched itself around in less than its own length , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back on the bull , knowing it would n't charge now , and also knowing that if it suddenly did , one of his banderilleros watching tensely behind the burladeros would fling a cape in its face to lure it away . There was scattered applause as he strode toward the fence , but not enough to warrant the confident smile he wore . The trumpet had blown during the last pass , and thep123two picadors were already trotting into the arena . They sat solid and round-shouldered on their nags , the broad beaver hats with the chin straps cocked on their heads , lances in their right hands in tilting position . The ring servants maneuvered the jogging horses along the fence , tugging them roughly by the rope reins . When fifty feet from the bull , the monos yanked and switched the first horse around so that its blindfolded and mattressed side and the picador 's right leg , encased in armor under his leather pants , were all toward the Miura . Tano went back to the bull again , inciting it to charge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , zigzaggingtoward the horse in a series of short charges , first on one side and then on the other , never losing control of the animal , and finally snatching the cape away from it leaving it stopped and set up in exactly the position he wanted in front of the horse . Normally this peon functional process would not even rate the attention of the crowd , but Tano had done it so smoothly  --  so completely as though he and the bull had rehearsed it  --  that the entire audience burst into applause . Tano doffed his montera in acknowledgment . This was what he excelled at and he knew it ; any maneuver in the ring that involved movement , which depended on his athletic legs . The classic veronica with the feet nailed that depended solely on the wrists to control the bull was not for him . The bull , fifteen feet from the picador , eyed this new antagonist alertly , head high , wondering if it was worthyp124of a charge . The monos switched the horse forward a step , and that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and socked against the mattress shield that protected the horse . The picador shot the lance just behind the hump of muscle where it belonged , and leaned his weight over on the pole . The bull kept pushing and hooking against the mattress , its back legs driving , and the quivering but unharmed horse was slammed up against the barrera fence . It was time for the " quite "  --  the takingawayact . Tano ran by the bull flopping his cape over its head as he did . The bull pulled away from the horse and the annoyingpain of the vara and veered after the man . Tano took him away with a wide , running pass . Then he got his hands right , planted his feet , and waited for the return charge . As the bull came , hard and eager , encouraged by having slammed the horse around , Tano swung the cape as though for a veronica , but halfway through he raised his arms , stiff at the elbows , and flipped the cape over his head and behind his back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what they knew they were going to see than that first pass itself . Tano was making his bid for ears early with the flashy butterfly pass . He held out one side of the cape from his body , like a woman holding out her skirt in a waltz , and he offered it to the bull as it swung around for its return charge . His body was exposed now , and he shook the cape so that the motion would make the animal hook for the cloth instead of his legs . As the bull charged by , he stepped back , andp125quickly held out the cape on the other side of his body . Stepping backward continually and crisscrossing the bull in front of his body by offering the bull alternate halves of the cape , he led the animal twenty feet across the ring , then snatched the cape away and retreated , leaving the bull set up in front of the second picador . The crowd cheered , and Tano took off his montera and basked in the applause . " He 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plenty of legs . " " Listen , Pepe , " said Pacote hoarsely , " I 'm going to skip my quite . ' Ca n't make it . " " All right , chico , " said Chaves unhappily . " They 'll howl , but to hell with them . " He motioned to Matagatos . " Take this one ! " Matagatos nodded and slipped through the fence . The crowd saw him and there were protesting cries of " Matador ! " and " Pacote ! " The " quite " was often the most excitingpart of the fight , for then the matadors were supposedto take turns luring the bull away from the horse and compete with each other in the skill and daring of the pass ; it was when the competition was hottest , most comparative , and most immediate . They had n't paid such high prices to watch a middle-aged man earn his daily wages doing a routine job . They booed . The bull was at the horse now , and Matagatos came up behind it methodically , chanting : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little terror for Matagatos , for he had great experience , and he also knew no one expected any/thing of a banderillero . He could look clumsy and cowardly and even throw down his cape and pile over the fence if he found himself in a tough spot , and no one would care . There was no hot competitive spirit or ambition driving him ; his only function in the ring was to help the big boy look good and try to protect him if he got in trouble . The bull swung away from the horse and went at the magenta sail which Matagatos contrived to make the first thing to attract its attention . Instead of holding his ground standing straight and guiding the bull by , the way a matador would have been required to do , Matagatos crouched over safely , knees bent , his feet ready to dance out of danger , his arms holding the cape out as far from his body as possible . In a series of unaesthetic , jittery , choppy passes , he maneuvered the bull away from the horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The public booed Matagatos as he slid back through the fence , and he smiled up at them cynically . They were really booing Pacote 's failure to appear . " A sweet bull , " Chaves observed , as he watched the bull charge willingly back to more punishment from the picador'slance . " I wish you 'd been able to take it . It 's sweeter than the sea . I knew it would be sweet when I saw it in the corral . " Pacote was holding the cool clay jug up with both hands and letting a thin stream of water spurt into his mouth . He washed it around in his mouth and then spat it out . He turned and glanced up at the crowd in back of him . There was the old Duchess of Penaranda right back of him up in the first row , looking young with her deep tan and whitep127teeth . With her was Timo , her son , the young duke , looking very British in spite of his Andaluz hat . And then he ran his eyes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , and beyond the PrussianlookingGeneral Queipo de Llano , and beyond Sweetie Seras and the Aero Club group , and beyond the men bawling " Gaseosa  --  soda pop , sherry , crab claws , "  --  and there was Socorro.  |p129SHE  WAS SITTING with a well-dressed , fat , darkskinnedman , and they were not watching the ring . The man was turned to her , resting his forehead in the fingers of one hand , and she was wearing that expression of completeabsorbtion that a woman gets only when the other person is talking about her . They seemed to be alone ; he could n't spot any of " the group " on either side of them . It irritated him that he felt something big inside of him when he looked at her . He made himself move his eyes on , and he saw several people he knew down from Madrid . He saw the old degenerateRaimundo Negro who never buttoned his collar and wore a dirty white coat and had n't much money but managed to get to almost every fight Pacote had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arruza , with his young , attractive mother . He 'd be fighting today in some plaza if he had n't cut his hand . And near him the torera , Conchita Cintron , big-jawed but pretty , sitting with the people who 'd come over from Lisbon . And there werep130the Sotomayors down from Cordoba . Pacote had worked on their ranch as a plasterer 's assistant , and it was they who had given him his first chance to get in the practice ring with fighting calves . And there were the Aznars down from Bilbao , and Tana , the Duque de Alba 's daughter . Ordinarily he 'd be glad that friends had come all the way across Spain to see him fight , but today he wished that everyone had stayed home , or that only strangers were going to see what he was going to do . In back of the Aznars was Felix Canieno , the slick gentleman torero down from Barcelona sitting with a good-looking girl in a white mantilla , explaining what was going on in the ring and mentally planning his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salazar of the A.B.C. , who was already scribbling in his notebook : " Tremendous heartfelt ovation from jammed Maestranza plaza , taken in los medios , great Pacote , fighting Sevilla for first time in two years , ceded to younger rival first bull , fine Miureno of caste and nerve but presenting no problems to the Madrileno . This one , after series of disappointing , vulgar veronicas , went on to show he admits few superiors in act of quite . ' Mariposa , pass one seldom sees done well nowadays and ... Pacote spotted the American couple across the aisle from Salazar . She was wearing a black mantilla and it did n't look right on her . He was wearing a broad-brimmed Sevillano hat and it did n't look right on him either . The person who sold him the hat should have told him you have to take off your tie to be castizo . Suddenly Pacote saw them leap up shouting , and so did the rest of the people , and he snapped his head back to the ring . Tano had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and he was down on his knees , the cape flashing over his head , the bull 's horn slicing by his shoulderonly a foot and a half away . " Ole , " came from the crowd . The next pass was even closer and " Ole ! " came from the crowd again , and still Tano was on his knees urging the bull to charge again and when it came this time and the horn went by the man 's body less than a foot away , a great " OLE ! " burst from the crowd as though from a single throat . Tano hopped to his feet and stalked disdainfullyaway from the bull , raking the applauding crowd with his eyes , his jaw out aggressively , and then , as though his belligerence were melted by the applause , he smiled his best little-boy smile at them . " God , was n't that wonderful , " said Helen Newton , applaudingafter other people had stopped . " What do you call that one ? " " I do n't know , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " " I wonder why he did n't go out for his what-you-m'callit , his turn . " " He 's just waiting to wow them on his own bull . And God , he 'd better be good after this build-up ! " The trumpet had blown for the banderillas , and the picadors were being led out of the ring fast . The people began to clamor for Tano to put in his own banderillas ; he knew that art better than any other matador in the world , except Arruza . But he was wiping his face with a towel down in the passageway , ignoring the petition , and one of his banderilleros took a pair of the barbed sticks with the gay paper wrappings and ran across the ring opposite the bull.  | " See your pal Pacote down there in the passageway , " said Newton to his wife . " He looks calm as hell . I guess he just does n't know the meaning of fear . " " He looks so damned aristocratic , does n't he ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get an awful lot across in this article . I 've got to show how completely Spanish he is , and how this  --  this idolatry of him sterns from Spain 's national inferiority complex . " The man in the seat in front of the Newtons was squirtinga red jet into his mouth from a small brown wineskin with " Pamplona " stenciled on it . He turned and offered it to the American . Newton smiled and shook his head , taking a silver flask partly out of his pocket in answer . The man smiled back understandingly and turned around . Tano 's man was running toward the bull , but at an angle , quartering the circle . The bull was charging fast but the man had the angle and the orbit gauged right , and he sidled past the horns , planted the sticks , and scuttled away while the animal 's momentum carried it in the other direction . There was only desultory applause ; the sticks could be a separate art when it was done by an athlete willing to risk his life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bull 's neck muscles to prepare him for the last act . " You know , " Newton went on , " they do n't have all the national heroes we have , I do n't know quite why , they just do n't , but in spite of all the idolizing , if Pacote were killed today  --  and I 've got to get this across too somehow  --  if he were killed today , and he died a brave , dramatic Spanish death , in spite of all the yapping and wailing that would go on , in his heart of hearts every Spaniard wouldp133be glad that he died . You see , this guy is Spain . They 're crazy about death , and to them this guy sort of symbolizes death and yet defies it . " " Oh , Robert , for God 's sake , have a drink , and shut up . Look at him down there . He 's cool as a cucumber . He 's not going to get killed  --  he 's going to stand them on their ears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trumpet for the final  --  and most important  --  third of the fight was sounded . The bull was wandering along the boards alone , occasionally jerking his neck around to try to get at the annoying banderillas which dangled from his shoulders . " Now let 's see what this new fenomeno has got , " said Chaves as Tano , in the arena , was handed the folded muleta and the wooden sword over the fence . Tano took off his montera quickly and neatly so as not to muss his hair . " The jug , " said Pacote . " My mouth 's a desert . " " You do n't want to get filled up with water . " " I spit most of it out . " He drank and watched Tano bow to the presidente of the program and then walk out further into the ring . " I spit nearly all of it out . " As , soon as he stepped out of the brown-purple shadow cast by the rim of the plaza , the sun hit him and made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " suit-of-lights . " Holding the folded muleta in his left hand and the sword across it , he extended his right arm offering the montera to the crowd . Leaning back like a tenor reaching for the third balcony , he pivoted slowly , and when he had included the whole audience , he tossed the hat over his shoulder , casually . The crowd applauded the dedication.  | " Dando coba , " said Chaves automatically . " Sucking up . " Now he swaggered slowly toward the bull , shaking out the red muleta , and as he did a sunny-side humorist falsettoedbetween cupped hands : " Amado mio ... This was a crack at his too-pretty face and his round woman 's behind , because Rita Hayworth sang the song in a movie currently playing in Sevilla . Most of the crowd got it , and there was some laughter . Someone else yelled , " Ay , Rita , so many curves and me without brakes ! " But Tano was too busy concentrating on the bull and fixing the muleta to hear . The red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the big magenta cape , and hence twice as dangerous to work with since the bull would be offered less of a target . Tano spread it wider with the sword point , and holding both the sword hilt and the muleta stick in his right hand , he slid his feet over the sand cautiously , his glance going back and forth from the still cloth to the bull standing attentively twenty feet away . It was a different animal now than the one that had charged gaily into the ring fifteen minutes ago . It was wary , more deadly , defensive . The Miura knew now that it was fighting for its life , that every charge counted if it was going to get this creature who was after it , this **39;6240;TOOLONG thing that always seemed to swirl out of the way , or if once reached , became a nothingness horns could n't get into . The bullfighter knew he was fighting a deadlier enemy . As he slowly closed the gap between them , Tano saw the bull studying his hips and thighs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that perhaps the postlike object which glittered was more the dangerous part of thisp135creature than the large soft area which was more active and sometimes separated from the rest . The bull fixed its eyes hard on Tano 's body . Tano " crossed " the bull , taking a sudden step forward , not towardthe bull , but across . the line where the angle of its body indicated it would charge . At the same time he shook the muleta once convulsively and shouted , " Hooi , toro , hooi ! " The irritating voice and the aggressiveness of the cloth made the bull swing its head slightly to the right away from the body and focus on the threatening folds draped over the wooden blade . Tano " crossed " again , and that , plus two more quick shakes of the cloth , made the bull lunge forward . Tano 's left knee bent before the horns arrived at the muleta , and his right leg went back out straight . He remained that way dramatically while he described a big smooth arc with the muleta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal in the buttock after it went by  --  the off buttock so that the bull would turn around ring-ward and not fenceward into the man 's terrain  --  and he forced the Miura by and around for another pass just like it , controlling it perfectly . " That 's the best thing he 's done so far , " Chaves said chewing the end off a cigar . " And how many people here realize it ? The kid knows a little something about handling the flannel . He understands the flannel . " Tano was standing up straight now , both hands together as though praying and the muleta stick and the sword handle between them . He shook the cape , and the bull charged.  | " Ole ! " burst from the audience , even before the pass was completed , for they saw that the man was n't going to step back out of the way , that he had confidence in the stand he had taken . He merely rocked back slightly on his heels , lifting the muleta before the horns hit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's back as the animal 's charge took it up into the air after its target . Tano did n't step back and he did n't step forward as the bull wheeled . He stood as though frozen , not even shaking the cloth , and the bull charged again.  | " OLE ! " the crowd thundered . And then two more oles as Tano stood there calmly , ten inches away from the driving horns that could spike completely through his thigh if they hit him , forcing the bull to charge by him , seemingly by will power . " Musica ! " yelled someone in the sunny section , looking up at the bandstand and brandishing a hand at it . It was echoed on the other side of the ring , but the Sevilla bandmasterwas a hard man to get music out of . " Musica ! " Now as the bull charged again , Tano spun in toward it as soon as the horn had skimmed by his legs , brushing against the bull 's shoulder as he did . When he turned his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the applauseand the cries of " Musica " were so numerous that the bandmaster was forced to raise his baton , and the gay , quick strains of a pasodoble rolled down over the plaza from the musicians ' box . " That bull charges on rails , " said Chaves . " Anybody could look good with it . " But he did n't take his eyes off Tano for a minute . Now the bullfighter was advancing toward the bull , holding the muleta partially behind his body , catching a bit of the cloth with his left hand . It was the pass Pacote had invented seven years ago , that had becomea standard in every bullfighter 's repertoire . " Toro , hooi-toro-bonito , " Tano chanted , the cape spread out by the sword and jutting out from his body like the sail of a boat running before the wind . The bull charged , and as the horns hit the cloth , Tano swung it back and up , leaning forward on his toes and arching his back like a diver doing a swan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm , and then he spun slowly around away from the bull and was ready for the next charge . Five more pacotinas , each closer than the other , the " Oles " coming regularly and building louder and louder with each pass , and then Tano strode away from the bull to the fence , slinging the wooden sword to the ground as he did . " With a bull like that he could make it sit up and moo if he wanted to , " said Chaves . " How are you doing , chico ? " Pacote was sagging up against the fence . " I 'm all right . I 'm doing fine . I 'm doing rotten , as a matter of fact . Still feel as though I 'm going to throw up . " Tano 's sword handler offered him the real sword , and Tano drew it out by its red-wrapped handle , the leather scabbard wilting as the blade abandoned it . The blade was purposely bent near its end so that the thrust would curve a course down toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence and pushed his weight against the handle several times to bend it a little more . He jabbed it into the folds of the muleta and went back to the bull . He gave the bull several chopping , wrenching. passes . Then he crouched a few yards from it and studied the animal 's feet : they had to be together to open up the small space between the shoulder blades for the sword . One hoof was in front of the other . Tano took two cautious steps to the right , and the bull shifted its weight , bringing its feet together . " Ya ! " breathed the crowd ; the most ignorant was aware of the legs-together principle  --  that and the business ofp140putting water on a muleta to keep it from blowing in the breeze . Now Tano straightened up and held the sword level with his eye , sighting down it like a rifle . With his left hand he furled the muleta over its doweling stick , flipping the red cloth clockwise so the animal would already start thinking left and toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and into the man . He raised the muleta to focus the animal 's attention upon it . The bull lifted its head , and then lowered it when the muleta was lowered . Tano cocked his right leg , rose on his toes once , and then lunged at the bull . He went over the right horn , the left hand performing its function of following through so that the lure of the muleta would keep the horn from being jerked up into the man 's body as he passed over it . And when the man and the animal were no longer one , the bull 's charge carrying it fifteen feet away , the crowd could see that half the sword was protruding from behind the bull 's hump . The crowd applauded , because by going in to kill correctly and placing the sword where it should be placed , the man had exposed his life , had invited a pierced lung , as at no other time during this encounter . " The beast will spit it out , " Chaves stated positively and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lost the ear . " The bull was charging wildly now , not feeling the pain of the sharp sword in him yet , any more than a soldier feels the pain of a bullet at first , but knowing something was wrong . The banderilleros were in the ring flashing capes in its face , spinning it to dizzy it and make the swordp141cut something vital inside . But the animal 's shoulder action worked the blade out and it fell to the sand . The crowd sagged back and " oh-ed " with disappointment : they wanted a clean , fast death as much as the matador did . Tano grabbed up the sword and angrily waved the banderillerosaway from the bull with it . He wiped the blade off by pulling it through a palmful of the muleta , and then he " squared " the bull again determinedly . " Corto y derecho ! " shouted a back-seat matador in the stands . " Short and straight ! " He went in at the bull from a short distance , shoved the sword in the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bloody shoulders . The bull stood absolutely still , coughed twice , its flanks heaving convulsively . It sagged back casually like a dog stretching , and then it flopped over dead . Tano spun on his heels dramatically , holding his arms up to the presidente of the ring and dropping his chin on his chest as though saying , There you have it . The crowd was applauding and cheering , and a great many men had their handkerchiefs out and were waving them back and forth as Tano went to the fence . " Macho teatro , " said Pacote objectively . " He 's got lots of theater . " The people waving handkerchiefs were still at it and they looked up at the presidente 's box and yelled : " Ear , ear ! " " If they give an ear for that performance , " Chaves said indignantly , " I 'll resign from the profession . " The dagger man of the ring ran out to the bull , andp142hooking a finger in the sword-hilt ring , he slid the blade out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather case off of his short dirk and plunged the blade into the bull 's head , two fingers behind the ear line . The coup de grace made the bull 's reflexes jerk the body stiff , and the puntillero was forced to jump back to keep from being gored by the dead animal . The mules were in the ring , and the monos were slipping the chain around the base of the horns when a banderillero cut off one of the ears . The monos cracked their whips showily , and the mules started up fast , the limp bull kickingup dust as its left horn knifed a ditch across the arena , its dead legs working in spasms . The crowd applauded the bravery of the bull and the men who had bred it as it went out the big gate into the courtyard to the pulleyed chains where the men in white aprons were waiting to butcher it . Then they applauded Tano , who was wiping his sweatingface with a towel , as his banderilleros handed him the ear . Tano took it and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supplicating look on his face . The three men stared back hard-faced , and the handkerchief of the presidente was n't forthcoming . Tano turned his gaze away , smiling up at the applauding crowd good-sportedly , and then finally he slung the ear at the fence disdainfully . A hat sailed into the arena , and Tano stooped , picked it up , and skimmed it back accuratelyfrom a stooping position . A flurry of hats and cigars came down further along the ring , from the sun-and -- shade section , and Tano , followed by his banderilleros , jogged to them . He stuck a cigar in his mouth , and thep143crowd laughed . His men kept the cigars and sailed back the hats . A full wallet splatted to the sand . Tano took out the bills , pantomimed slipping them into his nonexistent pants pocket , and the crowd laughed . He put the money back and tossed it up in the vicinity of its origin , and it was handed from person to person to its laughing owner . " Si , " said Chaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring looking up at the crowd that applauded as he went by their section . He tossed back dozens of hats , a white coat , a woman 's purse , and kept a bouquet of flowers , after smelling them appreciatively . Then the bugle 's grim notes sounded , and he and his men ducked out of the ring through burladeros . Pacote took a deep breath and breathed it out hard through his nose . " Well , here it is . " Chaves gripped Pacote 's arm tightly , " No funny business out there , see ? A mile away , see ? Especially on this first one till you sober up . "  |p145THE  TORIL DOOR was opened , and almost immediately a black shape appeared in the ring . It stood there alertly , then turned around to see where it had come from , then spun back facing the ring , looking up at the strange , buzzingphenomenon of the crowd , its tail switching nervously . Matagatos , ten yards down the ring from the animal , stepped out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . The bull came at him fast , running low . Matagatos slipped behind the burladero shield nonchalantly , looking up at the crowd as the bull skimmed by faster than a race horse . The bull galloped around the empty arena , and then Nino de Ronda squeezed through an opening and ran out toward the bull , flaring out his cape . He retreated hastily when the bull wheeled and went for him faster than he expected . It put on a burst of speed and the man flung the cape from him . The bull did n't swerve after the cape but kept coming after Nino de Ronda . His old-man legs were pumping away frantically , and he could tell howp146close the bull was behind him by the crescendo of yelling from the audience . He smacked into the fence beside the burladero shield and half fell into the opening as the horns hit the boards a second behind his fat behind . " That fool ! " said Pacote . " You hired him , " said Chaves and immediately regretted throwing it in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing with relief and the excitement of it . The bull was jabbing at the boards of the shield ; it knew this was an inanimate object and not worthy of a charge , but it worked off steam . The animal turned and went back at the cape , smelling it first and then ripping it up angrily . It was all right when its front hoofs were on it ; the tough material ripped fine then . But then the bull stepped off and gave it a rip and the cloth flipped up into the air and hung over its head hooked on both horns . The animal could n't see , and it trotted around the ring blindly shaking its head . It looked ridiculous with the yellow and magenta shreds flopping , and the crowd laughed . " Great beginning , " Chaves growled . The bull ran hard for the fence , but it heard the echo of its hoofbeats off the boards and slid to a stop in time . It was right next to the barrera . Chaves swore and reached way over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All right , " Pacote called in his deep voice to Cascabel . His tone was weary and exasperated . " Double him for me . " Cascabel , his face very white , slipped out of the burladero . " Toro , h-hooooooo , " he called . He had a funnyp147way of calling , and several people around the ring mimickedit . The bull , looking over the fence curiously at Chaves and Pacote , turned around at the challenging voice . Salazar of the A.B.C . was scribbling in the pad on his knee as the bull charged : " Bonito , number 22 , lots of atomic energy , sharp of horn , very gay and mischievous with peones  --  cost maestro 500 pesetas when it made kitchen rags of capote  --  almost rang up hospital charges on veteran Nino de Ronda  --  great expectancy to see the maestro 's art as he watched running of bull , planning campaign ... " Cascabel took the bull by him wide , holding the cape with only one hand as a peon should and dragging it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bull trailed the end of the tantalizing cape , hooking at it viciously , but followingstraight and true . " It 's as good as the first , " Chaves said elatedly as Cascabel changed hands and doubled the bull back into another charge , giving ground to it constantly . " We 're in luck , chico . Sees well with both eyes . Does n't seem to have an antler preference unless maybe it 's the right a little . He does n't have anything  --  charges like silk . " In the last doubling , the bull ate up all the ground left to the man , and Cascabel slammed himself through Pacote 's burladero with plenty of margin . The audience applauded the good routine job ; there was a right and wrong way to do everything in the ring , and this banderillero knew how to run a bull . " He does n't have anything , " said Cascabel , panting and wiping the inch of sweaty forehead that showed under hisp148montera with his finger . He was as relieved as though it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Run him again , " said Pacote , his lips back flat against his teeth . Cascabel stared at him in amazement . " But he does n't have anything at all , Paco ! No tiene na ! Ni na ni na ni na ! " " This uncle knows Latin , " said Pacote . " Run him again . " " Cascabel 's right , chico ! " said Chaves . " No point in running him any more . No difficulties there  --  like silk , he 's like silk when he charges ! " " Now listen , you sons of bitches ! " Pacote 's voice was quivering . " I pay you two and you take my orders . Run that frigging bull again ! " Chaves shot a significant look at Cascabel . " Run him , " he said . Cascabel shrugged . " Think of all the hundreds of other c-c-civilized professions there are , " he muttered as he went through the burladero . This time he took the cape in both hands ; the bull was learning too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-handed business now . Cascabel , angry , his jaw stuck out , worked the bull over in a series of fast , rough passes that were n't bad excuses for veronicas , but the crowd protested a banderillero 's using two hands for this initial caping . " Look at that beast , " said Pacote . " Look how he chops with that left antler . How did Miura dare to send this treacherous buffalo ? "  | " He 's charging straight as a nun ! " said Chaves , alarmed . " If he 's cutting with anything it 's the right . Ca n't you see it , chico ? Have I ever been wrong ? Ca n't you see it ? " " I see he 's an assassin with the left saber , that 's what I see . Do you want me to get killed ? " Chaves scrubbed his face with his hand exasperatedly . " Chico , you 're  --  you 're blind , you 're drunk . But just stay away from both horns and you 'll be all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not going out with that ox until after the horses . " " All right , all right , chico , " said Chaves , trying to make his hoarse voice soothing , " now just calm down and try to collect yourself for your quite . ' I think you 'll have to go out for your quite . ' Solorzano will have the bull dead by then . " Cascabel was through working over the bull , and he started to run back to the fence , but Chaves motioned him to stay in the ring . The bugle had blown and the horses were jogging in , beefy Solorzano on his black nag first , and El Pimpi ten yards behind . Chaves pointed to Solorzano , and Cascabel got it . When the ring servants had whacked the horse around so that the mattressed side was offered to the bull and the picador was set with his lance , Cascabel began to cape the bull over into the pic-ing position . The crowd , when they realized they were going to be cheated out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stamping and many cries of " Matador ! MataDORR ! " But they quieted down when they saw the bull headed for the horse 's side , fast and hard . Solorzano hadp150the lance jabbed in the middle of the bull 's back before the horns hit the peto mattress , and he leaned his whole weight on it as the bull banged away at the horse 's shield . The bull was brave and kept shoving and driving , the metal stirrup clanging against the horns as the bull hooked the horse back , hurling it against the fence . There , with the horse braced up against the barrera , Solorzano withdrew the bloody pic , already criminally placed , and sank it again in the bull 's back , tearing a great bubbling red gash in the flesh . This time the little shield at the end of the pole , designed to keep the steel point from going in more than a couple of inches , disappeared . The entire audience was on its feet shouting , brandishing fists at the picador and looking up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ya ! " said Chaves . " Now . " Pacote shook his head . " Matagatos . " " You have to go out sometime , " said Chaves . " You have to go out ! " " I 'll take the third quite . ' " " You better just go out and make a token pass anyway . " Pacote whirled on him . " Sure , me go out ! It 's always me going out , while you sit back on your fat ass  --  your fat ass that got fat by my spilling my blood ! Sure , why do n't I go out and make my quite ' while you stay here and count the money you 've made off me all these years ! " " Pacote . . " Pepe 's face was white . " And then when I get a horn in me , what do you care ? You just get a new boy , that 's all ! " " Paco .. "  | " Well , I 'm not going out , see ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal and came up behind the bull leisurely , letting it absorb as much punishment as possible . Then when the yelling from the crowd became deafening , he grabbed the bull 's tail , gave it a quick yank , and the bull swung around and lurched at the man 's cape . The torn meat was pumping out blood , thick , as though a dipperof Burgundy dregs had been sloshed over the black back . " Crimin-AL ! " yelled the crowd , as they saw Matagatos spinning the bull around , the picador getting his lance ready again , and the monos switching the horse out away from the fence . " Asesino ! Bandido ! Malaje ! Maleta ! Granuja ! Sinverguenza ! " The brave animal charged again , though with less enthusiasm , and the picador shot the triangular steel point of the vara lance deep into one of the same wounds . " Son of the great whore ! " screamed a man in the crowd , and cushions sailed down at the picador . One hit him in the arm . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the animal 's back . " Assassin , mother-raping butcher ! " Pacote sucked in air through his teeth as he watched , as though the vara were gouging his own back . He admiredand respected purebred bulls more than anything in the world . Much more than the finest blooded horse . Pero , que se hace  --  but what was one to do ? Even Chaves who had engineered it was wincing at the punishment the animal was taking . But one had to look at it like this : it was a question of the man 's life or the bull 's ,  |p152and  the bull would be dead in ten minutes anyway , and then this pain it was feeling now would n't exist and would never exist for it again . But the fiesta brava could be bloody ghastly when it wanted to be , as well as bloody beautiful . Who was it that said it was indefensible but irresistible ? " Toro , hooii ! " Tano Ruiz was standing up close to the bull now for his " quite " turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it went for the cape . Tano flipped the cloth behind his back and was going to take the bull in the flashy De Frente Por Detras , but after the bull made its first halfheartedstumbling pass he abandoned the idea . Shrugging exaggeratedly to the crowd , his hand out in a " nothing-tobe-done " gesture , he left the ring . People were still yelling when a sign was held up in the authorities ' box . " MULTA  --  300 Pesetas , " it said , and the crowd cheered . The horses were going out the big gate , the presidente having waived the third vara because of the bull 's condition , and Solorzano was protecting his head with his arms as he went into the tunnel fast , swearing under a hail of abuse and bottles and cushions . The critic Salazar was writing : " Cavalry justly fined 300 pesetas for rank abuses of the iron , monetary exchange no help for leakage of victim  --  justification for imposing a fine on the matador for failure to greet enemy or make appearanceduring first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cascabel placed a pair of banderillas , hooking them inp153the sedentary bull flat and from the side , and almost immediatelyMatagatos cut in with another pair . No point in going through a lot of filigree stuff with a bull as finished as this one now was . " The bull 's had enough , " Chaves said . " Enough sticks . . We do n't want them to suddenly decide to hand us that giant substitute because this one 's been punished too much . " " You trying to fight my bull for me ? " Pacote said , but he doffed his montera and held it up toward the presidente of the ring in supplication . The presidente nodded , and the bugle blew to change the " third " before Nino de Ronda could get in his pair . Pacote stepped shakily into the ring and slung his unused cape over the fence . The bull was thirty feet away , occupied with the colored sticks that clattered on his neck . " Paco , listen , get out of there ! " Chaves pleaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Water , " said Pacote . " Just go to the infirmary , " said Chaves , scratching the back of his hand nervously . " We 'll tell them it was an attack . " " Water ! " Pacote commanded , and Suarez handed him the red clay jug . He watched the bull out of the corner of his eyes as he shot the cold stream into his mouth . He was just as dry when he put the jug down . " Get him out of where he is , " said Chaves . " He 's in his querencia . For God 's sake do n't take him in there . " Pacote made the sword signal , a slight jabbing motion with index and second finger , and Suarez pushed it overp154the fence . It was the real sword , for Pacote had never believed in using a wooden one . Too much faking already in modern bullfighting . Fake pigtail , fake passes , fake bulls , fake swords . Let the maricones  --  the delicate Tano Ruizes  --  pamper their frigging wrists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hilt and drew the heavy blade out of the silver-trimmed sheath . He caught Matagatos 's attention and pointed his sword down the ring close to the fence . The bull was in his " querencia , " that bit of area in the ring that a bull arbitrarilytakes as his own , where he fights a defensive , choppy , impossibly dangerous fight . He had to be lured out of that part of the ring to where he would charge long and freely . Pacote held the folded muleta in his left hand and laid the sword across it , clamping the blade down against the muleta stick with his thumb . He took off the montera and held it by one kinky knob . Then when he saw Matagatos had the bull caped down the barrera to where he wanted , he walked along the fence until he was in front of the presidente 's box . He held up the montera , his dry lips forming the routine request for permission to kill the animal . The presidente nodded . Pacote tossed the montera over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the sword in his right hand and shook out the muleta . He took a deep breath and started toward the bull , walking the slow , solemn , arrogant walk that was his trademark . The crowd hushed expectantly . And then it happened . When he was ten yards from the animal it happened . Somehow he stepped on the skirt of the muleta , stumbled , and pitched forward.  |p155If  he walked like a high priest going up to the holy altar , when he fell it had the same effect as a priest 's falling . To see the dignified form sprawl on the sand shocked the ' crowd , and when they laughed it was not because they thought it was funny but out of embarrassment . As Pacote slowly started to get up , Chaves suddenly yelled from the passageway . " Look out ! Cuidado ! " The bull was charging as Pacote got to his hands and knees . Helplessly he watched it coming at him , saw its head down , the wild little eyes , the clacking banderillas , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the dried black stains . There was no chance to get to his feet , no time to run if he did manage to stand up , and the muleta was out of reach . He could do nothing but watch it bear down on him . So I am to die today after all , he thought , and in this ridiculous position too . " Toro ! " Cascabel yelled as he lept forward . Pacote saw the sudden flash of the banderillero 's cape between him and the bull . The animal swerved to hook the more enticing target , but it was too late . Its momentumcarried it into Pacote even though it was trying for the cape . The bulk of the bull 's shoulder smashed into the man 's chest , and he was hurled back to the sand , bloody and unconscious . The people in the crowd were on their feet as though lifted up by their own great gasp . " He 's dead ! " Helen Newton screamed . Chaves and Matagatos were in the arena gathering upp156Pacote 's limp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was holding its interest in his cape while the men handed Pacote 's body over the fence to Nino de Ronda and Suarez . Then Chaves squeezed his bulk back out of the ring , and after putting his hand under Pacote 's dangling head , they went down the passageway fast.  |p157THE  DOCTOR had been watching the fight from a place in the callejon near the infirmary , but the moment he saw the accident he ran up the tunnel . He had to unlock the door  --  expensive instruments had a way of disappearing  --  but still he was in his white uniform and ready when the three men panted into the small clinic . " Easy , easy . " Chaves was puffing . " For God 's sake take it easy . " Matagatos came in after them . They laid Pacote 's thin form on the operating table , and the doctor quickly ripped open the bloody shirt and vest . Chaves did n't look at Pacote  --  he watched the expression on the doctor 's face as he went over the torso , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was young , but he knew a lot about the injuries that occur in a plaza de toros . " Cornada ? " Suarez asked anxiously . " Horn wound ? " " Nothing . " " I knew it , " said Chaves with a wheeze of relief . " It was dry . I knew it was dry as dust . "  | " A lot of blood , " said the doctor , " but all cattle blood . We 'll try to bring him to now . Hand me that bottle over there . " It was fifteen minutes before Pacote flopped his head to one side and mumbled something unintelligible . It was anotherfive before he was fully conscious and able to sit up on the edge of the table . " Got to get back there , " he said groggily as he tucked in his shirt . " Got to finish that damned animal . " " You do n't know how long you 've been out , " said Chaves . " That ox is butchered and ready for the pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you ought to let him kill your next one too . Do n't you , Doctor ? " " Like hell ! " said Pacote , getting off the table . " I would think so , " said the doctor reluctantly . " Yes . You might have some ribs broken or a slight concussion or something there . I have n't given you a thorough examinationyet . " " Sure , he 's in no condition to go out , " said Chaves . Pacote hesitated . He sat down on the operating table again . It was cool and secure here in the infirmary . Out there it was hot and vicious and full of fear . The pain in his chest and the caress of the infirmary-excuse made him want to sag back and sleep and wake up to find that Tano Ruiz had killed the other bull  --  the last bull of his life  --  and then the nightmares would be gone forever . But there was no real hesitation . You could n't bow out sprawled out on the sand without even a token @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up shakily . " Now . " " All right . " Chaves said unhappily , but he knew that protesting would do no good . " Let 's go . "  | " I certainly do n't advise it , " said the doctor , not vehemently , but as though protecting himself against any possiblerepercussions ; he wanted to see the great Pacote performas much as anyone else . Pacote combed his hair and put on the montera , and the raising of his arms hurt . One sleeve was split up to the shoulder , his clothes were rusty with the dried bull 's blood , and he was barefoot . It hurt when he breathed . It felt as though all his ribs on the left side had splintered and were sticking into his heart and lungs . It would be good not to have to go back . " Your slippers are in the passageway , " said Suarez . Pacote walked out the door , and his picadors were there dismounted . " Nothing , " he said to them , and kept going down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes had become used to the infirmary 's electric light . He heard the music playing gaily , and when he stepped into the passagewayhe saw Tano spinning away from the bull after having placed a pair of banderillas , arms high , fingers spread , bouncing away stiff-legged into the roar of the crowd . Tano ran to the fence , snatched another pair of the barbed sticks from a ring attendant , and went back to the bull . He loped up to it easily , holding both banderillas out in front of him in his right fist as though fending off the horns . He circled around the animal , and when it started after him he put on a casual burst of speed and stayed five feet in front of the horns , zigzagging completely across the ring . The bull could have caught him easily , if it decided to , but Tano stayed just the right distance away , speedingp160up and slowing down bewilderingly , so that the tired animalwould n't be provoked into an all-out charge . The audience was cheering wildly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tano turned around , running backward to establish the correct distance . Then he took a banderilla in each hand and began stalking the bull , measuringcarefully , walking toward it slowly , heel-and-toeing exaggeratedly , his arms coming up from his sides and then going down in rhythm with his steps . There was suddenly a different mood , no longer gay , but a life-and-death mood . The bull was four feet from the fence , and Tano was going to try a difficult maneuver  --  to place the sticks while going in between the fence and the bull . If he miscalculatedby a fraction of a second he would be nailed up against the boards by the right horn . He stopped ten feet from the animal and held his arms straight down at his side . His chin was down on his chest , his back arched . The bull studied him , shifting its feet , tail switching . " Toro , hooi ! " Tano shouted angrily . " Hooi ! " The bull broke into its charge . At the same time , Tano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fourfootgap . He raised his arms high , and as the bull and the man came together , Tano hooked the barbs in and spun through the gap , a horn knifing into the boards where he had just been . A cape , flopped over the fence near the bull by a banderillero , kept the animal from pursuing Tano , and he walked calmly across the ring basking in the music and the frenetic cheering , acknowledging it with a casual half salute . Then the audience spotted Pacote back at his place be/hind the fence , and it applauded his return from the infirmary . The word quickly spread through the crowd : " No injury  --  a dry blow  --  it was the bull 's blood . " Chaves took off his dark glasses and nudged Pacote . " What 's this uncle up to now ? " Tano had the sword and muleta in his hand and was comingdown along the barrera toward them . He stopped in front of Pacote , extended his right hand holding the montera , and said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished colleague who has so deservedly earned the applause of the multitudes for so many years and who now passes with the maximum of glory into the ranks of the immortals of the science of tauromachy . " The crowd applauded . Chaves belched . " Horse dung , " said Pacote . Ruiz wheeled and regally tossed the montera over his shoulder . Pacote let it fall into the passageway without catching it . " This uncle is going to win the popularity prize if he 's not careful , " Chaves grunted . He moved his foot over and crushed the hat . Tano started the crowd yelling on his very first pass with the muleta . This bull was larger than his first and not as easy , yet he dominated it completely . He had drawn confidenceand inspiration from Pacote 's failure . His talent grew bigger than it really was , and he fought better than he ever had in his life before , better than he ever would again . It was as though Pacote , in retiring from the ring , had willed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One . At least that is the way Salazar of the A.B.C . saw it and wrote it . Tano went through every pass in his extensive repertoire . He took the sword out of the muleta offering the bull only half the target , and gave the animal nine dangerous " natural " passes in a row . He did the spinning windmill pass , the fancy " ki-kiri-ki " of Joselito , and the pacotina . It was as though the bull were completely powerless to deviate from the course the red rag led it . It was so dominated that at one point , after a series of right-handed passes , Tano was able to learn forward and gingerly rest his elbow on the bull 's forehead . Then he turned to the crowd , and pointed to himself , his lips forming the words : " Yo , el unico  --  I , the only one who can do these things ! "  |p163It  was very spectacular , and the crowd went wild over " el telefono . " They were already waving handkerchiefs for the presidente @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Chaves . " Next he 'll be giving us la television . " " He 's all right , " said Pacote , admiringly , too sick for jealousy . " Everything 's easy for him . " He discovered by pressing his hand on his left side that his chest did n't hurt so much . But he still felt nauseated and weak . Hats were sailing into the ring . Tano picked up one and hung it on the right horn . The animal looked ridiculous . He took another and placed it on the bull 's head between the horns , making it look like a mule with a straw hat . Most of the crowd cheered , although there were some protests . " And so noble , " said Pacote , grimacing . " What a thing to do to such a noble bull . Kill it , sure , but do n't make fun of it . " The bull shook its head , and the hats fell off . Tano went to the fence and traded swords . Then he lined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Chaves predicted . Tano went in for the kill well , but the sword struck bone and flew out . The crowd " oh-ed , " but Tano quickly gave the hull several more spectacular passes to make them forget the unlucky sword thrust . Then he tossed aside the muleta and picked up a broad-brimmed hat from the ground . Using the hat , and only the hat , to divert the bull 's attention from his body , he went in to kill again . He got away with the suicidal stunt , and this time the sword went in cleanly . The bull charged twice and then crumpled . " OR-E-JA , " screamed the crowd in unison , stamping its feet . " Both ears , Senor Presidente ! Ole un torero ! "  |p164The  presidente did nothing . Like an implacable Caesar he sat there , tight-mouthed , narrow-eyed , grim . Make them work for it . The crowd stamped and hollered , and the plaza was a sea of white , waving handkerchiefs . A banderillero cut off the bull 's ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matador . Tano held them up in one hand like two black playing cards , and his eyebrows questioned the authorities ' box . The presidente languidly signaled for one ear , and Tano threw one away . The crowd was applauding and motioning for him to take a lap around the ring . Holding up the car to the cheering crowd , he jogged through the hail of hats with his cuadrilla behind picking them up or catching them and sailing them back . A leather wine bottle plopped down on to the sand , making a rich sound like thorkkl when it hit , and Tano unscrewedthe top , held it at arm 's length , and shot a red stream into his mouth to the delight of the sunny section . But what sent them into spasms was when a crude piraticalwooden leg from high in the cheap section sailed through the air and fell in front of the bullfighter . This happened every year  --  a tribute from the wearer to the matador who was conceded the first ear of the season . Tano laughed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful vase . Then he kissed it and handed it over the fence for its journey back up the stands . Salazar was writing : " Sevilla witnessed forging of a bullfightertoday  --  except for bad luck with foil on first trip in , Tano Ruiz would have ... " Pacote looked up in the stands and saw Socorro standing up , cheering with the rest of them . He saw the dark/skinned man at her side was no taller than she was , and that made him smile inside . He saw the American woman throw down a silver flask when Tano passed below where they were sitting , saw Tano pantomime taking a drink from it and toss it back up . A rose appeared on the sand from someplace , and Tano smelled the petals and kept it , tossing the ear up in the direction the flower had come from . After he had made the round , the audience insisted he take another one . The applause still kept up , and Tano acknowledged it from the fence , but it swelled , and people shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the center of the ring . Holding up the rose , he pivoted slowly . Then he clasped his hands over his head and dropped his chin on his chest , as though overcome by gratitude . The trumpet blew , the ring servants raking the sand hastily withdrew , and Tano loped in to the fence beaming . Except for the " quite " he would have to make with Pacote'sbull , he was through for the day , a great day , the greatest of his life . He had cut ears before , but never in the toughest town of them all and not in competition with the Number One . Yes , he 'd " given the bath " to the NumberOne  --  the ex-Number One , and life was good . He vaulted the fence easily into the passageway , embraced his manager , and then turned to watch the toril door swing open . Pacote still had one bull , and Tano knew in his heart that should the maestro decide to cut loose , Tano 's performance might very well be eclipsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resigned face , and he felt secure . Number 120 , larger than Pacote 's first , walked out of the toril cautiously , looking around him . When Nino dep166Ronda flopped a cape over the fence it broke into a halfheartedcharge . Matagatos went into the ring and doubled the animal several times . " See , he 's cowardly ! " said Chaves shaking his head . " Itold you at the corral he 'd be manso. shakinghow he paws outat the cape with his front legs ? He just does n't want to bury his damned head down in the capote . He 'd rather jump on it than hook it . But he charges straight enough . Just do n't try anything fancy with him . You 'll probably have to end up facefighting him . " The bull suddenly skittered away from Matagatos , and heading back for the safe corrals it had come from , it cleared the high fence cleanly in one bound . The crowd in the stands laughed as two dozen terrified people in the passageway began spilling into the ring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his progress could be followed by the policemen and ring servants and photographersand carpenters tumbling frantically over the fence out of the passageway into the arena . It was like a wave breaking , the way one after another the men dove into the ring before the charging bull . Then a gate in the fence was swung open , the callejon was blocked , and the bull trotted back into the arena . He drove at the people in the ring now , and the fence procedure was repeated in reverse to the audience 's delight . Pacote slowly took his cape off the fence . The horses were already in the ring . " I guess I better get out there , " he said hoarsely . He stepped out from behind the shield into the ring , andp167as he did a wave of nausea broke over him , a combination of the chest pain and the liquor and the fear . He put his hand to his head . He felt himself wilt , and he sagged down , fighting it , to the white stirrup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sitting there , he vomited.  |p169CHAVES  jerked Cascabel 's cape from his hands , and leaning over the fence he held it around the sitting man . The crowd was silent and restless with embarrassment . " You 'd better go back to the infirmary , chico , " said Chaves gently . " Come on , get going . " Pacote did n't answer . He covered over with sand where he 'd been sick . " What a great idea this fight was , " he mutteredas he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand . But he felt a little better physically , anyway . Better than he had all afternoon . He batted down the cape that Chaves was holding around him and stood up . He picked up his own cape and walked along the boards . Matagatos had led the bull into the horse , and now Solorzano was hard at his butchering trade , his whole weight mounted on the pike . The crowd was coming down on top of him with screaming insults and cushions as he shot the lance again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal calling uneagerly :  | " Toro ahahahaaa . . . " in his deep voice , the cape ready in front of him . The bull pulled away from the horse and went for the man . The crowd forgot the vomiting and the picador immediately in expectancy . But Pacotc bent his knees , crouched over like Matagatos and swung the cape , taking the bull wide , two yards away , his feet jitteringbackward to safe terrain . He cited the bull for anothercharge and repeated the safe , ungainly pass . Then he veered the bull into the horse again . The trumpet sounded as the bull charged , but Solirzano kept working , cutting the animal down . " Sinvergiienza ! Shameless One ! " A cushion sailed through the air and struck Pacote on the side of the neck . " It 's you who pays him , " shouted a voice . " And it 's you who gives him the orders ! Cowardly murderer ! " Pacote rubbed his neck and squinted up at the sun-andshadesection . That 's where the troublemakers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , and the cheap sunny side was generally too glad to be there at all to get too nasty . But it was those bastards in between who could afford sun-and-shade ; they always had to show that they 'd been to plenty of corridas before and knew all about what they were seeing . Pacote spotted the shouter who was standing up and shaking his fist down at him . " You call that a pass , you big-nosed coward ? " It was the man who had given him the crayfish and the glass of cognac that morning . " You 've got your money , why should you bother to put up a decent fight ? " Pacote turned away , hugging his cape to him and holdingp171his chest where it hurt . Tano Ruiz had taken the bull away from the horse and was doing the flashy spinning lighthousepass , and the crowd left off booing the picador to cheer the matador . " Asi se torea ! " yelled someone . " That 's the way a bull is caped ! " When Tano had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing to the tune of the pasodoble " Pacote " : " Pacote , Pacote , you could n't even handle a robust rat if confronted by one in the doorway of a latrine . " Matagatos had a pair of banderillas in the bull before the picadors were even out of the ring , and Cascabel was right behind him . Nino de Ronda placed his by sneaking up in back of the bull safely to slide them over flat and from the side , and men in the crowd protested this illegality , half standing in their seats and wagging protesting forefingers down at the action , shouting , " No , senor , asi no  --  not that way here in Sevilla ! You 're in Sevilla now ! " The bugle blew . Pacote rinsed his mouth out with water and took the sword and folded cloth . He bowed to the presidente and then walked back in front of Chaves . He did n't make a production of it . He said simply : " The last bull of my life goes for Jose Chaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed him the hat , and they embraced briefly . He started out to the bull with no attempt at style or build-up . When the animal charged he gave it a wrenching , punishing pass from a safe distance . Then he pursued it , crowding it to make it charge , chopping at it with short passes , wearing it down more than it was so that the greatp172'head would sag even lower and make the sword thrust safer . As he worked away on the bull , sweating with the running and the dancing , he held his side with his left hand to press away the pain . " What 's happened to him ? " Robert Newton asked his wife . " What the hell kind of an article can I write about a fight like this ? " " It 's a rotten bull , that 's all , " she answered uncomfortably . " Nobody could do anything with a creature like that . " " Like hell . I know that much about this game . It 's a good bull . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that much . Unless I write it from Ruiz 's standpoint  --  the clean young aspirant showing up the dissipated old maestro . That might be a good idea . Either that or chuck the whole thing and do a piece on Andaluz folk dances . " The audience was not catcalling or throwing cushions now . They just sat in sullen silence . They were n't angry . It was more a feeling of guilt that oozed into the plaza . They were responsible for the myth . People want heroes , need heroes , but it seemed they had created a hero where there was no hero . It did no good to hear the person in the next seat slap his leg for emphasis and say : " I tell you , I saw him here in this very plaza only two years ago , and I swear nobody in the world ever fought like that ! " It did no good , for memory is fickle , and his greatness depended upon the memory of man alone , and when that memory was dead his art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books could be reread whenever proof ofp173greatness was demanded , nor a painter or sculptor whose works would live after him . No matter how great people said he once was , the memory of those past times was being extinguished now with every maneuver they were witnessingin the ring . It was n't because he was too old or because his timing was off . His art was based on a state of mind , and he had not been able  --  had not wanted  --  to achieve that state of mind of having to be The Best , of knowing he could dominate any bull that might come out of a toril . Julio Salazar was already writing : " Sevilla saw a pale , spent , stuttering legend of the great Pacote Torres and regarded it with horror . " The only person in the plaza who was pleased with the performance was Chaves . " That 's it , chico ! " he was callingto him jubilantly . " Echale la mano abajo  --  keep that hand down  --  give it to him from point to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it ! " Someone in the crowd yelled in a bored voice : " Water , " and the cry was echoed apathetically around the ring . A slight breeze was disturbing the muleta , and a strong enough gust might blow the cloth across the man 's legs and lure the horns into him by mistake . Pacote left the bull to come to the fence , his eyes down avoiding the crowd . " The heavy one , " he said wearily , tossing his muleta over the fence . Suarez had the yellow-lined muleta out already . He sprinkled water on the edge of it and began scuffing it on the ground so that it would pick up sand and be heavier vet.  | " Look ! " cried Chaves suddenly , reaching over the fence and grabbing Pacote 's arm . Pacote whirled around . An eighteen-year-old boy in ragged dungarees and shirt sleeves had leapt down from the sunny-side stands , over the barrera , and now was racing across the arena toward the bull . In his right hand he had a patched muleta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pacote muttered , forgetting that this was the way he had made his own bid to be a professional . He put his fists on his hips and jerked his head angrily at Cascabeland Nino de Ronda and Matagatos to be ready . One could n't try to get the boy out now without risking gettinghim killed , for he had already slid to a stop ten feet in front of the bull . " Toro , huhuh , huhuh ! " the pale-faced boy was calling professionally as he edged toward the animal . His arms jutted out stiffly , his body straight , his white sandals shufflingover the sand . The Miura waited until the boy was four feet away ; it was letting him come way in where it could get a good short chop at him , for the animal was spent and crippled and did n't want to waste a charge on anything but a sure thing . " Toro ! " It charged . The boy held his ground , swung the cloth , sucked in his stomach , and the bull missed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This last bull of the afternoon might provide some entertainment after all , in spite of Pacote . The boy cited again , and again the bull grazed by his legs.  | " Ole ! " shouted the crowd , and the boy said it with them unconsciously , encouraging himself . The color was coming back into his face , as the first fear left him . Pacote 's banderilleros were hovering around the action , waiting for a chance to take the boy away . " Move in , " Pacote called to them . " Get that mamarrachoout of there ! " And the crayfish man was bawling : " Leave him , so that the maestro may learn what close work means ! Ole el espontaneo , ole talento ! " El espontaneo , the spontaneous one , was forcing the bull by with close , graceful pacotina passes that were almost as good as the ones Tano Ruiz had done . Obviously this boy was no neophyte  --  he was an experienced amateur seeking his big chance , knowing he 'd probably get fifteen days in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him would spot him , bail him out , and make it worth while . Every pass he got away with was making Pacote 's performancelook that much worse . " Get him ! " Pacote yelled desperately . The espontaneo ended the series of passes with a **27;6281;TOOLONG pass , and beaming at the cheering crowd , he withdrew from the bull a few feet to change his grip on the cloth . Nino de Ronda saw his chance and ran forward . He grabbed the protesting boy by the arm and swung him around back toward the fence . The bull , incited by the action , charged . Nino de Ronda , with his cape folded in one hand , was helpless . The boy stumbled forward to safety , but the older man was caught up on the horns with a high , woman 's scream . He seemedp177to hang there hunched up on the Miura 's head for an eternity , still clutching his cape . Then the bull lowered its head and snapped it up with tremendous force . Nino de Ronda sailed fifteen feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , the cape streaming out behind him like a rocket 's tail . He crumpled on the sand two yards away from Pacote . Pacote saw the bull pounding forward , the man lying there with eyes crossed and bulging with terror , his bald head stark and obscene above the tanned face , the makeshiftribbon that held the pigtail slipped down over one eye like a buccaneer 's patch . There was no banderillero near enough to flare a cape out to distract the Miura . There was only Pacote with no cape in his hands and no time to grab one . He did it automatically without thinking . " Eeee-yah , TORO ! " came the yell from the deep bellows of the man , and the crowd saw Pacote lunge forward . He reached Nino de Ronda when the horns were three feet from the fallen man . Shooting in between the bull and the banderillero , Pacote slapped his right hand across the bull 's nose , just below the eyes . He swerved hard to the side and sprinted for the fence , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ louder and louder as it gained . But then the man crashed into the fence by the burladero , and Chaves hauled him through the opening to safety just as the horns hit the boards . When the bull wheeled and started to go back to Nino de Ronda , he was confronted by Cascabel and a large cape . Matagatos picked the babblingman from the sand and helped him limp to the fence ,  |p178the  blood pumping down his thigh into his faded pink stockings . The policemen had the espontaneo in tow and were hustling him down the passageway . And Pacote heard it as he helped Nino de Ronda into the callejon . He heard it and found it sweeter than anything he 'd ever listened to . It kept up and swelled , and Chaves pushed him out into the arena to acknowledge it . It grew louder as he stood there looking up at them in wonderment , his hand half raised , and God , how sweet it was after the silence and the hate . The crowd was quick to boo and quick to despise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a good audience , a great audience ! Sevilla , the best audience in the world ! But there were no handkerchiefs and the applause was not long enough or loud enough . Some people were not applauding  --  he could see Salazar was not applauding , and the Americans had stopped , and Socorro  --  he could n't quite see Socorro because someone was standing up to stretch . And then all the applause was gone , and he took the sword and muleta and started back to the bull . By Christ , he knew how to get them applaudingagain ! He knew better than anyone in the world how to start people applauding ! Now we will see , Senor Tana Ruiz , he thought . Now we will see , all you yelling sons of bitches . We will examinethis thing of fighting a bull . He strode out toward the bull arrogantly , angrily , so straight it was as though he were leaning backward , his left arm bowed way out from his body , his right holding the muleta like a swordsman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the authority of his voice and the different way he was carrying himself made thep179audience hush . It made them stop in the middle of lighting a cigar or taking a drink to lean forward expectantly . " Now ! " Salazar breathed , tapping his pencil against his teeth nervously . " Now ! " said the little man of the crayfish . " Now it comes ! " " Oh , God , " Helen Newton said , wrenching her handkerchief . " Now he 's going to do it ! " Pacote stood out there like a statue . He was going to wait it out , going to let the horn go by his legs only inches away , the way only he in all the world could do it . " Toro , ahaaaaaa ! " The bull 's head went down . " Toro , take it ! " He shook the muleta . The animal lunged forward , but it slid to a stop halfway through the pass and jerked its head . Pacote had to jump back and give ground or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Salazar slapped his forehead . " The thing has ended ! " There was nothing to be done . The animal was through . The picadors had finished it , and the espontaneo had milked out the last few complete passes it had left in it . The bull did n't have the strength or the will now to charge through , to charge hard and fast , charge to kill . Any pass he tried to do with his half-dead animal would look ridiculous . Damn Solbrzano for doing it , and damn Chaves for arranging it ! And damn himself for letting it be done ! The audience groaned , and some began to leave the plaza in boredom . There was nothing more to do . After two point-to-point functional passes , Pacote lined the bull up , maneuvering itp180to get its feet squared away . He could n't even kill it right , the dangerous , proper way , because he knew it would stay where it was and chop and not charge through so that he could go over the right horn . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pacote sighted down the blade . He rose briefly on his toes , and then ran at the bull , but off to the side , jabbing the sword safely into the lungs , a foot from where it was supposed to go . The effect was immediate and unpleasant . The animal hemorrhaged from the nose and mouth , lurchingand reeling backward , tipping drunkenly to the side on two legs , then wobbling to the fence and dying sick against the boards . And there it was . The fight was over , the last fight of his life , and he 'd made it  --  made it alive . But there was no consolation there , for he looked up at the stands , and the people were putting on their coats and shaking their heads disgustedly and starting to file out the portals , too apathetic to bother to boo the criminal sword thrust or insult the beaten shell of the matador . They were pouring out to homes and cafes where they would tell others , where they would tell the world : " Tano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest fighter in Spain , really gave the bath to Pacote , always did say the big-nosed one had more propagandathan Stalin and less guts than the Italians at Guada-lajara ! " Chaves had clambered over the fence into the arena . He was embracing him and clapping him on the back with both hands . " Ai , caray , Pacorro de mi arma ! We made it , you did it , what a party we 're going to have ! We 'll call your mother and ... "  |p181But  Pacote pulled away . He was staring over the fence at the No-Do cameraman and his assistant hurriedly taking the film out of the big double-humped camera and clatteringthe reel into a tin container . Three days from now that film would be showing with every newsreel in every movie theater in Spain . A ring servant shoved Pacote aside so the drag mules could be driven up to the bull . He walked dazedly to the fence , looking up at the crowd that was slowly shuffling along the narrow aisles and jamming up at the exits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notes that would be written into an article that would be cabled to Mexico and Lima and Bogota where he was an idol . Pacote saw Sotomayor leaving , Sotomayor who had given him his first chance to fight . He saw Socorro sitting there waiting for the crowd to thin , making up her face and talking animatedlywith her escort . He saw the American writing in a little notebook as he and his wife inched up the crowded aisle . He saw the crayfish man talking with his friend and gesticulating angrily . And it swept over him , starting with a burning prickling in his back and engulfing him like a wave : I 'm going to do it , I 've got to do it , I 've got to do it to exist ! He whirled around . " Get it for me ! " he ordered . " Get what ? " asked Chaves , frightened at the look in the man 's eyes . " Get what , Paco ? " " The sobrero , " he hissed . " The substitute ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound came out . " Get it ! " said Pacote . " Hurry , tell them I 'll pay for it , pay double for it ! " " No ! " Chaves shook his head and his fat jowls quivered . " No , Paco , I wo n't ! Do n't be crazy , do n't be a crazy fool ! " Pacote caught him up short by his coat lapels and snarled : " Get it ! " " Like hell  --  I 'm not going through that again for you or ... " Pacote drew his right arm across his chest and lashed out at Chaves , the back of his hand smacking hard against the man 's fleshy cheek . The blow knocked off Chaves 's wig , and his dark glasses dangled from one ear . Chaves stared bewilderedly at Pacote , wheezing , fingeringhis cheek , his eyes beginning to water . " All right , chico , " he said quietly , reaching down for his wig . " I guess this is the way it had to be . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for God 's sake ! " Ile prodded Chaves through the burladero and sent him scurrying down the callejon to send word up to the authorities . Suarez had already packed the canvas cape bag , but Pacote snatched up a folded cape off the top and shook it out . " Get everything set up , sword handler , " he said , picking up the montera and jamming it on his head . " We 're stayinga while ! " The bugle had n't blown , and the people were still leaving . He had to do something quickly to stop them from leaving . He started up the passageway toward a burladero . Tano Ruiz was coming down it on his way out of the ring , a cigarette in his mouth , his dress cape slung casually over his shoulder . " Why the hurry , Maestro ? " he said . " The fight 's over . " Pacote shoved him out of the way . " Mine 's just begun , " he flashed over his shoulder as he slid through the fence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bugle blew , and Pacote ran stiff-legged across the empty ring to where the bull would come out . He knelt down thirty feet in front of the toril , swirling the cape out on the sand in front of him and holding the edge of the cloth with his right hand . The amazed crowd saw what was coming  --  another bull , the substitute bull  --  and they realized that the man was going to meet it with the beautiful , archaic , dangerous " larga cambiada . " There was a scramble to get back to the seats . The latch was jerked , and the red toril door was swung back.  | " Toro ! " Pacote called at the dark tunnel , at the unknown , shaking the fist that held the cape . He could n't see anything yet , but he knew the bull could see him , and he wanted to focus its attention from the first moment . " Toro ! " Suddenly he saw it  --  a giant black and white shape looming up in the tunnel . Then Pocapena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Pacote 's yell was staccato , like a machine gun , as he called death to him . The bulk skidded around and headed for the kneeling figure . Pacote watched it coming , hurtling toward him , head low , the great tossing hump swollen , and he had to fight to make himself stay there helplessly on his knees with only a magenta cloth to protect himself.  |p186Stay  on your knees , you bastard , he swore at himself . Stay on your knees , you cowardly bastard ! For the love of your mother and your dead father stick it out , do n't run , do n't sway back , stick it out , you ball-less wonder . . . you 'll be just what she called you if you do n't stick it out .. . Twenty feet away , then fifteen , then ten .. . Now ! Still kneeling , he swung the cape over his left shoulder and revolved his wrist to make the cloth blossom out . The bull swerved at the flash of yellow and scarlet , its left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ole ! " burst from the crowd as though from a single Brobdingnagian throat . Pacote got to his feet casually , but his heart was almost choking him . The animal was even larger than he had thought and the horn had come closer than he had meant it to . It was wheeling for a return charge , and he could see the big spread of crooked horns , the whole sagging head lopsided , as though the pinto animal had been made of wax and a flame held under the right side . He held the collar of the cape in his teeth while he hastily arranged his hands right on the cloth . He did n't have to talk to the bull or shake the cape  --  it was driving back at him now , hard . He waited for it , back arched , chin on his chest , legs straight , feet together , flat , as though screwed into the ground and incapable of being moved backwards even if he wanted to . On that very first veronica , without knowing how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God it did n't hook badly , he let the animal 's left horn stab byp187his legs twelve inches away , and he neither moved his feet backward nor attempted to sway out of danger . " Ole ! " came from the crowd , and he did n't really hear it until he thought about it , but then it was a beautiful sound . He remained motionless after the bull 's momentum carriedit by , and instead of chasing after the animal for anothercharge , he stood there like a post , watching the animalhurtle away . He watched the animal hard , watched him gallop on around , watched him as hard as he could , willing him along . Come on , come on , keep going , torito , keep going on around , beautiful-ugly bull , do n't ruin it now , do n't make me have to break and chase you , keep coming .. . Pocapena ran completely round the ring , stopping only to hook its horns once into a burladero and send the slats sailing into the air . When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it in exactly the same position , his feet planted in the same spot . It charged hard and from a long way off , but Pacote knew its left side was the good one now , and he waited it out , sweated it out , holding the cape closer to his body , dropping the right hand down as the bull reached him and watching the horn on the loweredhead miss his stiffened knees by only five inches . " Ole ! " On the return charge , Pacote took the bull ten inches away to see how the animal handled its right weapon . Then the bull charged on the good side again , and Pacote worked three inches from the horn . " Ole ! "  |p188On  every pass he was showing the Sevillanos what real " temple " was  --  that rare quality of insouciance and controlwhich slows the bull down to conform to the leisurely swing of the man 's arms . Compared to the quick , jerky movements of Tano Ruiz , his motions were a moving-picturefilm geared down to the last stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right , but he took it on that side again , arching in his body so that the horn point was two inches from the gold braid on his legs . " OLE ! " On the last pass of the series , a tight half-veronica where he swirled the folds up against his hip like a dancer 's skirt , he sucked the bull in so close to him that the rounded curve of the horn glanced off his legs and almost knocked him off balance . " Ole ! " A ring servant ran up to Chaves in the passageway . " Nino de Ronda  --  " he said , measuring off two inches on his index finger to indicate how deep the horn had gone . " Well , tell them to get him out of there to a hospital or someplace in a hurry , " said Chaves , wringing his wig frantically . " There 's only one operating table in that infirmary ! " Pacote strode away from the bull , looking up at the roaringmob and hearing the blessed strains of music rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already , and he went up to Solorzano , walking along beside the jogging horse as he talked : " Pic this one right , my friend ! Right in its place , right in the cross ! "  | " But Chaves gave me five thousand pesetas to cut them down ! " Solorzano protested , as he set the lance under his arm . " And I have to defend myself against this cathedral . " " I 'll give you ten thousand to do it right , " said Pacote between clenched teeth . " If you ruin this animal for me , I 'll make a steer out of you ! " He told the same thing to El Pimpi and then went back to Pocapena , luring it into position in front of Solorzano 's black nag . The bull showed signs of interest , but it did n't charge . The monos beat the horse a step forward , and the bull reacted with a shake of its head . But it did n't charge . " Talk it up ! " Pacote commanded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat face was the color of sweetbreads and glistened with sweat ; he knew that the size of the animal automatically meant a long fall for him . " Eee-yah ! " The bull backed up , wagging its horns . " Work on him ! " Pacote ordered , apprehensive now , for a bull that wo n't charge the picadors is considered cowardly and must be returned to the corrals . Solorzano waved his lance . He shook his armored leg out of the metal box stirrup and swung it back and forth tantalizingly . The bull pawed the ground , but it would n't charge . " I 'll get him charging , " Pacote called . He advanced toward the hull and attracted its attention . It charged willinglyand hard into the cloth . He spun the animal around twice and then snatched the cape away from its face , leavingit in front of the horse again but at a different angle . It did n't charge.  | " Eee-yah ! " Solorzano yelled . Bolder with the surety that it would not attack , the picador rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The animal bellowed , and Pacote hated the sound , for a bull that bellows generally is afraid . It gave another hollow bellow , lowered its head , and backed up . " Keep after it ! " Pacote shouted . He was panicky inside now . It had to charge , they could n't take it away from him now ! Not after such a great beginning . He was alreadymaking absurd promises to God , to the Virgin . Let it charge the horse , please God make it charge , and I will give up all the money I make in this fight to the Church , I will give up anything , I 'll give up the idea of retiring . I 'll give up the ranch if You want , I 'll ' give up my life even , if You 'll only just make this animal ' charge the horse ! Solorzano rode right up into the bull 's face . But it would n't charge . In all the plaza there was only one person who knew why the animal would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes behind the dark glasses squinted with pleasure at his secret and his fat belly quivered with silent joy . He had learned the secret twenty-seven years ago from Joselito , a month before he was killed . He had seen it happen with him , saw the remedy the master of all matadorshad prescribed , and never forgot it . Now he saw Pacote spin the bull again with the cape and try once more to make it charge , saw Solorzano ride his horse up to the bull beyond the line a picador may go , and saw the bull , that very brave bull , back up , and Pepe Chaves was glad . The bugle finally blew , and Pepe whistled with relief.  |p191The  gate was opened , and the trained steers lumbered in , the bells that hung from their beige necks clanking lugubriously . They started for the bull , and after a tentative hook at one of them , Pocapena quieted down to join them . They started back out the gate . " Al , que bonita es la vida ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ! I have n't been to Mass in ten years , but I 'm going tomorrow ! I 'm going every day ! " Then he saw Pacote lurching toward him , tears streamingunashamedly down his cheeks . " Why ? " he was gasping . " Why would n't he charge ? Why could n't he have charged the horses ? He was a great senor toro , an uncle , he was n't manso ! Why , Pepe ? " Chaves put his hand on Pacote 's shoulder , his joy disappearingat the sight of the man 's face . " Just a rotten bull , chico , a cowardly bull . " " No , Pepe , it was n't manso , I swear it was n't ! " " Well , " Chaves said , haltingly , " you 're alive , chico , and  --  and that 's all that matters . " And in the saying of it , he realized the lie of it . That was n't all that mattered ! All that mattered to the man was the fiesta brava , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mattered , nothing else had ever mattered , and without it the man would n't want to exist . He , Pepe Chaves , had no right to keep him from being himself . It was n't just ego , the momentary sweetness of applause ; for Pacote Torres it was survival . And perhaps coupled with that was a fierce , foolish urge to fulfill the people 's need for a hero , a Quixotic sense of duty to a tired nation to prove that it could still produce brave men . " Pacote ! " he burst out suddenly . " Stop then ! "  |p192Pacote  lifted his head , staring uncomprehendingly . " Stop them ! " Chaves shook him by the shoulders roughly . " He is n't manso  --  it was the horse , chico ! It was the horse the bull did n't like ! " Pacote kept staring . " Maybe from the bravery test  --  maybe the pic who punished him when he was a calf was riding a black horse ! Try him with El Pimpi 's horse ! " Pacote turned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prod the steers out of the gate with Pocapena hemmed in amongst them . " Hurry ! " said Chaves giving him a shove . Pacote broke into a run crying , " Stop ! " The bull was separated , the steers were driven out , and the gate was slammed . Pacote caped the bull back across the ring into position in front of El tail whipping its flanks . " Make me wrong , " Chaves was praying . " Dear God , make me wrong ! " But the bull was lunging forward now , and it hit the side of the horse with a smack that all the plaza heard . El Pimpi was shooting the pic in where it was supposed to go , where it would weaken the neck muscles but not cripple the animal . The bull 's power slammed the horse back against the fence , and then Pocapena stabbed his long horns under the horse 's belly . Tossing with the great hump of muscle it lifted up both horse and rider and spilled them over the fence into the passageway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it turned away from the barrera , there on his knees.  | " Toma , torazo , guapo ! " he called . He almost never had done kneeling passes , not considering them true classic bullfighting . But this crowd liked tricks , so tricks they would get . " Charge , pretty monster-bull , charge ! " Pocapena shot forward . It was the same " lighthouse " pass that Tano had done  --  the cape and arms going over the man 's head , then the kneeing around for a return charge , the cloth writhing and leaping , a beautiful live thing in Pacote 's hands . But where Tano had taken the animal a foot or more away , Pacote dealt in inches . The first pass let the horn go ten inches away , the second eight inches , and the third two inches . And on the last pass , he had to sway back slightly , for if he had n't the horn would have spiked through his head like an ice pick through an eggshell . As it was , one epaulet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached up to yank it off contemptuously . He got to his feet and strode away from the bull into the din of the crowd that reverberated against the sides of the plaza . The stands were already a sea of white , and cries of " Oreja , oreja " echoed around the arena . The uninjured white horse was led back into the ring , but Solorzano was riding it ; El Pimpi was in the infirmary with a broken shoulder . The bull charged hard again , smashed the horse up against the fence , and ripped off the peto shield viciously . Solirzano was pic-ing it correctly , bearing down , but in the right place . Then the bull drove its right horn up into the horse 's chest . Like a punctured balloon the animal collapsed down to its knees , dead , propped up against the boards.  | " Yours ! " Pacote called to Tario Ruiz . " It 's yours , infant  --  get him out of there ! " Tano lured the bull away , before it could charge the helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite . " But Pocapena was not like the other smaller bulls  --  this animal 's withers were level with Tano 's own shoulders . He did n't have the experience , the nerve , or the skill to handle it . The bull was controlling him , it was doing the deciding as to where it was going to charge ; the man was just getting out of the way , instead of standing still and controlling the bull , guiding it so that the animal got out of the way of the man . And he made the unfortunate choice of veronicas . The hurried vulgarity of the passes , contrasted with the classic ones Pacote had sculptured , could n't have shown the crowd the difference between truth and fakery more clearly . Tano ended with a token half-veronica , and then walked into the scornful , deepfreezesilence of the audience . Pacote held his montera up to the presidente to ask that the " suerte " be changed , that the bull had absorbed enough punishment from the picadors , and the crowd cheered as the bugle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead horse after taking off the saddle and bridle , and Solorzanorode out of the ring , beaming at the strangeness of the cheers he received . Matagatos quickly had a pair of banderillas in the bull , and Cascabel followed with another pair , running in to the animal at an angle and then cutting away fast . Matagatos trotted to the fence for the third pair . A ring servant handed him two yellow-frilled ones , but Pacote came up to him as he started back to the bull.  | " I 'll take a try at the garapullos , " he said . " Give me those palitroques ! " " You , Matador ? " asked Matagatos . He 'd never seen Pacote place banderillas . " We 'll try the lazy man 's way . " Pacote jerked the sticks out of the man 's hand . He licked his thumb and wet the steel points , for luck and to make them slide under the skin easier . Then he broke them over the fence so that the barbed ends were only six inches long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much closer to the horn points , when he placed them . " Las cortas , " Matagatos breathed . " The shorts ! " " Ay , Dios mfo , " Chaves pleaded , " do n't get fancy , Paco , please do n't get fancy ! " Pacote reached over the fence and pulled the handkerchiefout of Chaves 's sport coat , wrapping the splintered end of one of the banderillas with it to protect his palm . He took his own handkerchief out of the slit pocket in his jacket and wrapped the other one with it . " Vamo ' a ve ' , " he said . " Now let us see ! " With his arms at his side , the little banderillas jutting viciously out of his hands , he stalked Pocapena , talking to it softly , friendly . " Hah , toro , hahaaaaaa ... " He walked cautiously toward the bull and stopped fifteen feet away with no one in the ring and nothing to protect him . Feet together , he arched his body and jerked his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he called loudly , giving a little hop into the air . The great head came down and the bull lunged forward.  |p196Pacote  did n't move until the animal was six feet away , coming straight at him . Then he put his hands together and suddenly jumped out his right leg , swaying his arms and weight over with it . The bull thought its quarry was breaking off to the right , and it swerved slightly off its course to intercept the flight . But Pacote sucked his right leg back to his left just before the horn reached it , and the bull 's momentum kept it from correcting its mistake . At the same time Pacote stretched way over the lethal head to jab the two darts into the hump of muscle as it went by , the great shoulder bumping him back up against the fence . Pocapena was preoccupied with the banderillas , bucking with the sting of them , and Pacote walked quickly down along the fence to where Suarez and Chaves were . He was n't hearing the roar of the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , all right , " said Chaves gruffly as he wiped Pacote 's face with a towel . " Let 's cut out this funny business and settle down to some bullfighting . You 've sucked up to the gallery enough . Now get to work and correct that hook , and to hell with looking pretty . " " He 's charging all right on both sides , " said Pacote , panting slightly . He stuffed one of the handkerchiefs into his pocket  --  he had plans for it . " Sometimes , maybe , " Chaves said quietly , intensely . He handed him the sword and muleta . " But that bull 's an assassin . The right hook 's still there , and if you do n't correctit you 're going to pay for it when you have to go over it to kill . Fight him rough and wrenching and let the pretty stuff go by ! You 'll still get an ear . "  | " I 'm cutting everything today , chico , " Pacote said . " Everything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning fast . " Pacote picked his hat off the sand , nodded to the presidente , and started to dedicate the bull to Chaves again . " No , no , " Chaves protested , " to the crowd  --  the crowd ! They made you , I did n't . " Pacote began the walk to the center of the ring . And then he had an inspired idea.  |p199HE  WENT to the sun-and-shade section , singled out the crayfish man , and held out his montera to him . The delightedpeople around him kicked and prodded the unhappylittle man to his feet . " It goes for you and your lungs , " Pacote said . " Let us see if we can silence your venom . " Wheeling , he tossed the hat over his head back up into the stands . Pocapena was completely across the ring . Instead of electing to fight in the safety of the protected area along the boards , Pacote walked out to the center of the ring with that slow , measured step , like a king going up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the arena , he took out the handkerchief , spread it on the ground , and stood on it . Then he draped the muleta over the sword , and holding it for the Pass of Death , he shook it . " Toroooooo , " rang across the hushed ring . The bull lifted its head , its snout jutting forward as though smelling the spoor of its enemy . " Tor00000 ... " Pacote shook the muleta violently.  |p200Poca|pena  took a step forward and then another , and then it trotted , and then it cantered , and then it burst into a full gallop , charging hard across the yellow expanse toward the tantalizing figure . When the animal reached him , Pacote raised the cloth slightly . That was the only movement he made as the horns sliced by five inches from his legs . " OLE ! " cracked down from the plaza , so loud and sharp that it sounded like a public address system suddenly flipped on . He did eight more Passes of Death out there alone , alone in the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onep201before , yet controlling the bull so completely that he never had to step off the handkerchief . It looked so easy the way he did it , so safe , as though the bull could charge nowhere but at the cloth . But the crowd knew that the animal went where it did only because the man made it go there , forced it to charge precisely where he wanted by his skillful wrist and knowledge of angles and terrains . Though his gracefulmovements looked casual and his heavy-lidded eyes remained as expressionless each time the animal hurled itselfat him as though his adversary were a hornless calf , everyone in the plaza knew that one miscalculation with this giant animal would result in tragedy . They 'd seen how easily it had destroyed a burladero , how neatly it had tossed one horse over the fence , how surgically it had annihilated the other . Now he held the muleta partly behind his body in the pacotina pass and looked away from the bull toward the stands , toward the place where Salazar and the other critics were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muleta to make the bull charge . " Matame , Pocapena ! " he shouted . " Kill me , Pocapena , kill me if you can ! " " No , no ! " yelled the crowd , for the man was not even going to look at the animal as it charged , was just going to pray that it charged the cloth target instead of his body . They enjoyed watching a man almost killed , but they did n't want to see him commit suicide . " No , man , no ! Look at the animal , for God 's sake ! " " Toro ! " yelled Pacote . " Matame , toro ! Kill me , bull ! " Chaves covered his eyes with his hands . The sword handler began to whimper.  | " Toro ! " Pacote shook the cape as he yelled . " Toro-toro-toro ! " The bull charged . It scraped by the man but somehow missed him . Five more times Pacote repeated this pass , never once looking at the black-and-white shape before it charged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green with its own dirt , at the end of each attack . For a while during the " faena " there had been a kind of music , for each musician spontaneously had unpacked his instrument and made crazy noises over the hubbub , each playing a different wild melody , making it sound like a pack of wounded animals . But now they abandoned their instruments and entered into the screaming . There were no " oles " now . There was just a continual roaring with cries of " Oh God ! " and " Jesus , Maria and Jose ! " And Salazar , cynical , blase Julio Salazar , who had seen over nine thousand bulls killed in his life and who prided himself on never displaying any emotion , was on his feet with the rest of them making unintelligible gobblingsof delirium . No one could be bothered to wave handkerchiefs  --  everyone was clutching the person next to him , dizzy with the tremendous emotion that the man and the cloth and the bull were producing . The sun was not on the arena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tano Ruiz , as gaudy and gay as a Llopis corrida poster ; what was going on now was as stark and tragic as a Goya etching . The newsreel cameramen were recording it all , pass by pass , and it was fortunate they did , for no one who did n't see it would have believed those twenty-four " natural " passes.  |p203He  began the historical " tanda " by walking up to Pocapena , light blinking off the sword in his right hand , the muleta trailing behind him , his body insultingly exposed . He stopped in front of the animal , offering it his unprotectedhip . Then he dragged the cloth up parallel with his body . He lashed it back and forth on the sand , back and forth until the bull charged . Without the sword to spread the cloth the muleta was an insignificant target , and before every pass Pacote had to convince the animal that the cloth was its enemy , not the man . He would take it by on its good left side every time , spinning slowly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge again , wrappingthe great bulk around his body . Pacote was shouting with the crowd on every pass , caught up by the fever of the noise , sober now , but drunk with the magnificence of what he was doing . Twenty-four passes in a row he did , and twenty-four times he should have been killed . Each time Pocapena came so close that the great shoulder brushed against his body and painted him with blood until the gold of the costume looked orange and the white silk black . And so smoothly linked together were the charges that it seemed like one continual charge , a wind-up toy going around and around the man on its track . But the toy was wearing down and learning , beginning to wonder if the elusive red cloth actually was its enemy . It was time to kill . The last act of the tragedy was over . " Kill it ! " Chaves was calling . But when Pacote started to " square up " the bull , the crowd began stamping its feet , yelling , " More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suarez exclaimed weakly . " After that they want more ! " " More ... they 'll always want more , " said Chaves digginghis fingernails into the boards of the fence . " That bull is n't right to be killed yet either  --  Paco still has n't correctedthat hook ! " " More , more , more ! " the crowd was chanting . " Mims y mas y mas ! " " Kill it , " Chaves shouted . " Kill it now ! " Pacote looked up at the crowd and shrugged . If they wanted more , they could have more . They could have anything today . He was drunk with excitement , soppedp205with power , and his fear , his terrible fear was gone . He was the best , the best , the best ! " Torito ! " he called triumphantly , disdainfully . " Little bull ! Charge , little bull , charge , little calf ! " He cited the bull for a right-handed pass with the sword spreading the cloth . As the horns reached the muleta , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his knees and made the bull charge again . Five times he did that , bloodying his shirt and shoulders as he spun in against the animal . After the last pass , still on his knees , he went toward the bewildered bull . Closer and closer he came , the muleta and sword dragging uselessly on the ground . Closer and closer , and the bull was so dominated by the man that it did n't charge . Closer and closer , relentlessly , past the point of no return . If the animal charged now he would be helpless  --  at this distance the horns could n't help but kill . The bull backed up a step and looked as though it might charge . But it did n't . Right up into the animal 's face he kneed himself , right between the spread of horns . Leaning forward , he kissed the bull between the eyes , on the kinky hair between its eyes . Then he took the tip of the bull 's left horn between his teeth . The crowd was frozen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was none of the small noises , the cough , the rustle , of most silences . There was only deathlike soundlessness as they watched in horrified fascination . The slightest movement or noise might cause the bull to shake its head and send the horn tearing through the man 's skull . But , as though hypnotized , cowed by the206brute animal courage of this kneeling creature in front of it , the bull did n't move . Pacote turned slowly on his knees , the horns almost against his back , to stare up at the crowd with glazed , fanatical eyes . Then , for the first time in his life , he smiled in a bull ring . Holding up a forefinger , making fun of Tano Ruiz and himself at the same time , his lips formed the words : " I  --  the only one who can do these things ! " He got to his feet and strode away from the bull , and the roar of the crowd broke forth . He cast the muleta aside scornfully and picked up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until its feet were together and sighted down the blade . He held the handkerchief in his left hand , to use it to protect himself and distract the bull away from his body . " No ! " the crowd was screaming . " No , man , no ! " " Off to the side and into the lungs ! " Chaves yelled through cupped hands . " Paco , for God 's sake ... " But this one , more than any other in his life , had to be finished off right . After rising on his toes and focusing the bull 's attention on the handkerchief , Pacote hurled himself straight at the animal . He lunged over the lowered right horn , letting the animal 's own momentum impale it on the sword . The bent blade , slicing down toward the aorta , disappeared as easily into the shoulders as though into a mound of black and white lard . But while the man and the bull hovered in one shape , the great head suddenly jerked up , the crooked horn stabbed hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bull 's head . He could feel the curly hair and see the crazyp207flopping of the banderillas and hear the wheeze from the wet snout , and he saw the yellow-whitish horn  --  the puscoloredhorn  --  sticking up into his crotch . He grabbed the base of it with both hands , trying to fight it , trying to wrench it out of his body , but his weight made him spin , head down , and he felt it corkscrew way up into him , tearing through the flesh up into his stomach . And then the horn was pulled out of him with a sucking sound , and he was slammed to the ground . The bull started to charge again as he lay on the bloodyingsand . Suddenly it wobbled , coughed , and fell over dead . Chaves and Suarez were already in the ring , Chaves waddling frantically and with amazing speed , but Cascabel was the first to reach the inert figure . They carried him across the ring , and the gate was swung open for them . " A little more ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the stands . " Would you like a little more , you bastards , would you like a little more ? " El Pimpi was sitting on the operating table with his chest bandaged and his arm in a sling , but he got off fast when he saw them come in the infirmary , and they laid the unconscious man down gently . " Doctor , it 's bad , " Chaves babbled , " This one 's bad , it 's bad ! " The doctor looked at the blood pooling on the table and whistled silently . " Get the clinic right away  --  tell Quintanato get over here right away ! We 're operating ! " There was a telephone in the outer room ; Suarez ran to it and called . " You 'd better wait out there , " said the doctor as he be/gan to slash off the spangled suit with a scapel . " Do you know what type blood you have ? " Chaves shrugged , suddenly helpless , out of character . He shook his head . They went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Except Cascabel . He knew what type his blood was , and he was kept in the operating room . In a little while , Doctor . Quintana came in . He was in a white uniform , and he went straight into the operating room without speaking to them . One could n't smoke in there . Chaves did n't know what to do . He took his wig out of his breast pocket and picked at the hairs , singling one from the others and then snapping it out delicately . Soon his wig had a bald spot on the crown . He carefully examined each square of the fine mesh which was the scalp of the wig . Then he slumped back against the wall and stared at nothing . The others went outside to smoke , but he kept sitting there . The door opened , and a young priest came in . He looked very scrubbed and good , and he wore thick glasses . " They said I might be needed here . " Chaves swallowed and pointed to the operating room . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , his good face looking worried . " I 'm going for Father Gabriel , " he said . Chaves wanted to ask how Pacote was , but before he could get his nerve up , the priest was gone . In a few minutes the door opened again , and it was Socorro . Chaves lifted his face out of his hands . " You , " he breathed.  | " It 's taken me all this time to get through that terrible crowd around the gate , " she said . " And then the gateman would n't let me through . I had to give him a hundred pesetas . How is he , for God 's sake ? I saw a priest leaving here . What was he doing here ? Is he dying ? He 's dying is n't he ? " " Dying ? You ask me that ? You ? " " You animal , " she said , " tell me ! " Chaves 's voice quivered , " He 's  --  he 's got a hole in him , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to fill . " " Dying . . . oh , Pepe ! " She paced up and down . " We love each other  --  we 've always loved each other  --  he asked me to marry him this morning . And I said I would .. I said I would after the fight . " She moved close to him , her eyes bright . " We can do it now . Before it 's too late . We can do it now if we hurry . But we 've got to hurry . " Chaves stared at her hard . " I do n't believe you . " " I swear it , Pepe , I swear it ! By the crucified Christ ! He asked me to marry him , but I did n't . . . I could n't .. . not then , because , well , his nerves ... you know how his nerves have been . . . but I want to marry him now . He needs me . I 'm going to marry him now ! " Chaves did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking through her . " Well ? What are you staring at ? Take me in to him . " He scratched the back of his hand . " You love him ? " " Yes , of course , " she said . " And he loves me . youknow that . " Chaves whistled silently to himself . " Then you ought to get married . " He repeated it as though trying to convince her . " Yes , I think you should get married . "  | " Well , that 's what I 'm trying to tell you ! Let me go to him . " " We have to get the priest first , " he said , standing up . " He just left  --  we can catch him if we hurry . " " Let 's go , then ! " Chaves opened the door for her , and Socorro stepped outside . As soon as she did , he slammed it behind her and turned the lock . He leaned up against the inside of the door , and putting his fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the blessed Macarena , Pacote 's millions were n't going to go to any five- peseta whore ! He could feel the angry pounding and hear the invective , and it made him shake all the more . But then he saw Cascabel come out of the operating room , rolling down his sleeve , Chaves 's laugh melted into a groan and he left the door to go up to him . " How is he , how is he , man ? " " Gravisimo , " said Cascabel . " Very grave . I 've seen him hurt plenty of times , but I 've never heard him complain like this . You 'd better call his mother . Maybe she can fly down from San Sebastian . He 's out of the ether now if you want to go in . " " You call her , boy . I ca n't talk to her now . " Chaves went in . Pacote was under a sheet , his ascetic face gray , the scar that notched the left side of his face stark white . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friend , Doctor , " he was murmuring , his eyes closed . " Call your friend in Madrid . " " I have , Paco , " the doctor said , " and he 's on his way . " He turned to Chaves . " He means Arroyo , the horn spe-cialist. "  | " Jesus , what pain ! " Pacote exclaimed suddenly , his eyebrowsconvulsing together . " Ca n't you put my leg better ? It feels doubled up under inc . " The doctor looked at Chaves , wrinkling his forehead and shaking his head . Pacote opened his eyes and saw Chaves . " I Iola , the great Pepe , " he breathed . " Did t he animal die , Pepe ? " " Si , chiquillo , si , " said Chaves . ' Fears started down his cheeks from under his ( lark glasses . " It died and they did n't give me anything ? " Pacote struggled to his elbows . " And they did n't give me any-thing ? " " They gave you everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail , and hoof . The first time they 've ever given a hoof in the Maestranza . " " That was a fight was n't it , Pepe ? " He asked it like a small boy . " That was a fight , chico . " Pacote eased back on the table , a flickering smile trying to establish itself in one corner of his mouth . " It 's just like God says , eh Pepe ? Take what you want  --  but pay for it . " Then he said weakly : " You know , chico , you ought to get hold of that espontaneo . He had plenty of salt , a real salty boy . " " I 'm never going to step into a plaza de toros again as long as I live ! " Chaves was dabbing at his cheeks with the crumpled wig . " Do n't talk crazy , " said Pacote , reaching his hand out feebly and putting it on Chaves 's forearm . " You get that kid . He 'll have to do some time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you grab him . " His face contorted . " Ay ,  |p212ay  ! What a tobacco that bull handed me ! I never had one like this , Pepe . " Cascabel came in . " I called your mother , Pacorro . She 's on her way here . " " Gracias , Desperdicios . How she must be suffering . " Suddenly he stiffened . " Doctor , I ca n't feel anything in my right leg . " " You 're all right , Paco , " said Doctor Quintana . " There 's nothing to be worried about . " Pacote lay there breathing hard . Then he said : " Doctor , I ca n't feel anything in my left leg ! " " That 's all right , " said the doctor . " You 'll be well in no time . You 'll be walking around in a month . " " Doctor , " said Pacote in a frightened voice . " Are my eyes open ? I ca n't see ! " He half rose up on the table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed there with his back to Pepe , and then he reached over and gently closed the dark eyes . A great sob came from Chaves . " More and more , " said Cascabel dully , the tears spilling down his face . " They kept demanding more and more  --  and more was his life , so he gave it to them . " " We did everything possible , " the doctor apologized . " But the size of the ... " Sure , sure , " said Chaves . There were tears in his mouth , and he spat them out on the floor . He backed away from the table and stumbled toward the door . He went out , lurching past the others , not seeing them . It was night now but not very dark yet . He went out into the quiet patiop213de caballos and through the gate . There was a silent crowd lounging there , and one person asked , " Flow is he ? " But Chaves kept walking , not hearing . He was conscious of the American journalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wondered if I could ... " Chaves shoved him aside and went down a narrow , crooked street , not knowing where he was going , just wanting to get away from the plaza de toros . He rounded a corner and was aware of someone way below him talking to him . " Por Dios , caballero ... " He looked down and saw a truncated man riding on a coaster with children 's skates underneath . The man smiled a toothless smile , dropping one of the leather-covered blocks with which he propelled himself and holding out his hat . " Charity , for God , caballero , charity for the love ofGod , pity this wretched . . . " Holy Mother of Jesus ! " Chaves croaked . He gropedin his pockets frantically and threw all his coins and the gold money clip with Sohirzano 's torn bills in it , and a medallion and the keys attached to his lucky monkey 's head and his wallet and his cigars and his address book and the comb he carried for Pacote to use in the ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the half-man . Then blindly he staggered past him down the street . " Heaven will repay you , " the beggar mouthed happily as he gathered up the loot.
