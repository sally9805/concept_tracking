In a high-school classroom one night last week a group of Ottawa 's retail store clerks listened attentively to the first in a series of lectures , sponsored by the Ottawa Board of Trade , on a delicate subject : how to captivate tourists . First lecturer was the mayor himself , portly E. A. Bourque . Ottawans in general , the mayor told the class , should cut their lawns , paint their houses and keep their garbage cans out of sight . Above all , they ought to take care when driving through puddles not to splash pedestrians . " The people you splash might be tourists , " he warned , " and tourists are highly insulted when splashed . "
