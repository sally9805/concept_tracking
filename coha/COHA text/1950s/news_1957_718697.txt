txt The Treasury Department took a step in the interests of economy - just the other day and the way we get the story is this : Mr. Nils Lennartson , a special assistant to Secretary Humphrey , knew of his boss 's remarks about that haircurler of a depression that faces us wooner. or later if somebody in Washington does n't start saving money . Mr. Lennartson knew also that Congress and a lot of newspapers had been yelling about reducing the budget and that people had been writing letters about all the spending . So Mr. Lennartson cancelled two of the three news wire services the Treasury used to keep step with what was going on . One of the wires was The Dow Jones News Service , which is offered by the publishers of this paper and a good one , too . When the men who sell the wire service for Dow Jones heard about the cancellation , one of them went right down to Washington to find out what the trouble was . Our man was ' told by Mr. Lennartson that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal 's position about Government economy that he had decided to save the Treasury Department $1,680 a year by cancelling the Dow Jones service . Well , our reaction to all this is , Fine ! If the Treasury Department does n't need the Dow Jones service , would be wasteful of the tax money Dow Jones and everybody else pays into the Treasury to keep the service . Furthermore , we 're glad that our editorials about saving the taxpayers ' money are getting some results in Washington , even if the economy we 're all for seems to start with us . And while $1,680 does n't look like very much of a start on a budget of $71.8 billion , well , maybe we all better remember that , as this newspaper has pointed out a number of times , the way to begiti is to begin . And that a little here and a little there can amount to a lot.of savings in the end . That , of course , still goes . We do hope , though , that the Treasury 's economy drive does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
