The audience might well have frightened any composer out of his augmented triads : it consisted of 600 moppets between five and twelve . Children , so the theory goes , are the ideal connoisseurs of modern music , because they have no built-in esthetic prejudices , and last week Venice 's prestigious International Festival of Contemporary Music paused in the midst of its strenuously avant-garde schedule to put the theory to the test . In the baroque Fenice Theater , the kids saw nine one-act Games and Fables for Children , composed on commission by a group of noted moderns . <P> Included in the program were German Composer Hans Werner Henze 's atonal , heavily percussioned fairy tale , The Emperor 's Nightingale ; Polish-born Composer Alexander Tansman 's Stravinsky-flavored exercise , New Clothes for the King ; Italian Composer Nino Rota 's The Cunning Squirrel . All three were hits . Henze 's work , in particular , won a shrill , twelve-minute ovation . But defenders of the moppets ' taste were badly shaken when Carlo Franci 's Final Comedy and Giorgio Ghedini 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banana-peel pratfalls-seemed to touch off a lot more enthusiasm than the serious moderns . <P> Critics were less amused than the audience . " Some of these composers , " said Corriere della Sera severely , " falsified their music to please the children . That means they have sold their souls to the devil , which disqualifies them to write for the innocent . " The final word was left to elegant , 62-year-old Composer-Critic Virgil Thomson . " I have no opinion on this performance , " said he , " because I think Venice is not for children anyway and can only be appreciated when one is over 70 years of age . "
