 | Huntington Library , California Treasure House @# THE ELEVATOR stopped at the subbasement , and we walked out . " This , " said Robert O. Schad , as he opened the bank-vault doors of solid steel , is the safest place in the West . " Military men and residents of Alcatraz Island might choose to debate the point . But Mr. Schad is Curator of Rare Books for the Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery in San Marino , California . He made his claim with a librarian 's care . " Here we are protected by 30 tons of four-inch armor plate recessed in a casing of reinforced concrete nine feet thick , " he continued . " Even if a Hiroshima-type atomic bomb hit near by , the contents of this vault probably would survive . " I examined the 12-by-23-foot inner vault , empty except for a small pile of boxes on a lonely tier of shelves . " A microfilm of our most valued possession , our card catalogue , " Mr. Schad explained . " It took four decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sanctuary for " Pinkie " and " Blue Boy " " In case of war , what else would you store down here ? " I asked . " No doubt the Gutenberg Bible would come down ; Mr. Huntington paid $50,000 for the two volumes . And certainly the even more expensive copy of Venus and Adonis ' by Shakespeare . Pinkie ' and The Blue Boy ' would both come here , of course . " I was glad that these two charming portraits of 18th-century English children would be so well protected . I had spent weeks here photographing the paintings , rare books , and magnificent gardens that railroad magnate Henry E. Huntington bequeathed to California . Time and again I had returned to those two paintings . In ' the early mornings , when Huntington 's marble home , now the art gallery , was empty and still , " Pinkie " and " The Blue Boy " were good company . I could even sympathize with the little old lady from the East who not long ago crossed the continent to see these famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifelong illusion shattered . " Do you mean to tell me that the Pink Lady did n't marry Little Boy Blue ? " she asked a guard . As gently as he could , the guard explained that those young people had belonged to different generations . The Blue Boy posed for Thomas Gainsborough during the year of Sir Thomas Lawrence 's birth ; Pinkie , the captivating child Lawrence painted in a flowing gown on a windy hilltop , died soon after posing at the age of 12 . The two are linked as companions in countless prints on the walls of homes and schools , but theirs is only a canvas courtship . In real life they were far apart in age . Treasures Came in Carload Lots I spent many days among such Huntington treasures . I turned the handwritten pages of Benjamin Franklin 's Autobiography ( page 267 ) and saw bits of the original manuscript of Jack London 's Sea Wolf . Gingerly I fingered the morocco bindings of priceless Shakespeare first editions and examined the tapestries and furniture and porcelain of some of the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres of flowers and trees collected from around the world , and I paused frequently before statues by great sculptors . Like other visitors who have come here in the three decades since Henry Huntington left his collections to the public , I was awed by the scope of the hundred-million-dollar estate and repository of beauty . San Marino itself lies largely on land once owned by Huntington . Early in this century he sold large tracts of his San Marino Ranch for the building of this residential city . He also donated a site for the city hall . A spur from Huntington 's southern California interurban railways once penetrated  | to the heart of San Marino Ranch , and over it came carload lots of books and art objects , garden fountains and statues purchased from European estates , and trees and shrubs from far continents and islands . In one of his three private railroad cars Huntington could travel directly from San Marino to Manhattan . Part of the way he rolled over track built by his extraordinary uncle , Collis P. Huntington , one of the financiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 19th century . People who live and work around San Marino take immense pride in the Huntington estate and collections . On my first visit my taxi driver gestured across a sea of ivy before a row of modern mansions . " Thirty years ago , " he remarked , " all this was Huntington orchard land . " " There was where the railroad spur ended , " he said as we passed through wrought-iron gates and entered the grounds of the library and art gallery . Gardeners were wielding palm branches like brooms , flicking fallen leaves from lawns and sidewalks into the path of a motorized raking machine . To care for gardens and buildings , a staff of some 60 men toils around the calendar . And to keep the lawns green for the 150,000 pairs of visitors ' feet that wander over them every year , the grass is annually " renovated , " which means virtually ripping it up and replanting . Gardener Recalls Half-century of Effort Curiously enough , it was during a walk in the gardens that I learned most about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago in Oneonta , New York . With me was William Hertrich , 80-year-old gardener emeritus who planned every inch of the 200-acre estate in company with Huntington ( page 273 ) . Lean and muscular , Mr. Hertrich strode off before me toward a garden corner of the estate where stands the world 's largest collection of mature cactus . Already , he said , he had walked three miles through the gardens , just as he had every day for 50 years . Many were the mornings he had walked with Huntington before the gardens existed . Together they had foreseen the shaded vistas that stretch away toward the San Gabriel Mountains to the north or across the San Gabriel Valley to the southeast . Together they had planned and planted from seed the grove of redwoods now towering high over the massive library building . They had planted the first commercial avocado orchard in southern California and nurtured one of the finest botanical collections in America . Pennies Grew into Millions What sort of man , I wondered , was this Henry Huntington , who poured his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English masters , and decorative objects by French artists ? Was he eccentric ? " Yes , " Mr. Hertrich replied , " he was ! " It 's true , you know , that he spent millions with his right hand and saved pennies with his left . His wife once pointed out that at one moment he would pay $10.000 for a rare book and then walk the length of the mansion hall to turn out an electric light . My dear , ' Mr. Huntington said , if I did not save the pennies , I could not buy the $10,000 book . ' " I myself remember Mr. Huntington 's picking up nails that the carpenters dropped when they were building the library . " Huntington was congenial with his workers . It was difficult to gain his confidence , but once he had placed his trust , an employee became an executive with authority beyond question . I asked Mr. Hertrich : " Did you ever feel that Mr. Huntington was selfish , spending millions to beautify his own gardens ? " " I knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Hertrich said . " In 1906 , before this house was built , the San Francisco earthquake and fire destroyed the beautiful home of Collis P. Huntington . Furnishings , paintings by Rembrandt and Van Dyck , everything was lost . " One evening after that , Henry Huntington  | told me he would build here in San Marino a place substantial enough to withstand both fire and earthquake . He would build something that would be an asset to the people of California . You see , I knew from the beginning that this would one day be part of California 's heritage . " We were walking along graveled paths among 1,500 varieties of cactus and as many more of other succulents ( page 274 ) . " All cacti are succulents , " Mr. Hertrich said , " but not all succulents are cacti . " He cut into the stem of a succulent with his knife . White latex oozed out . When cut , a cactus gives up water like the reservoir it is : those in the Huntington gardens are watered only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese Garden The cactus garden had been Mr. Hertrich 's own idea . At first Huntington had opposed it . The master of San Marino admitted that his grudge against the spiny plants dated back to the time he supervised construction work for the Southern Pacific railroad on the Arizona desert . While backing away from a grading machine , he had been severely punctured . But Mr. Hertrich 's persistence prevailed over his employer 's poignant memory . Later , in a single shipment , the gardener of San Marino imported three railroad carloads of cacti from that same Arizona desert . To show them in natural surroundings , he added five carloads of volcanic rock . Other shipments followed , finally converting an eroded hillside into a living cactus fantasy that draws admirers from all the world . We walked through rose arbors and down flights of steps into a pergola . In springtime this miniature canyon is ablaze with blossoms from a thousand varieties of camellia . Every plant is labeled . " In the blooming season , " Mr. Hertrich remarked , " people come with notebooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurseries . " At a bend in the path we were transported across the Pacific to a garden in Japan . A moon bridge arched a flowering lily pond , and 256 a pagoda sheltered a temple bell . Water tu : . bled down a hill below a Japanese house an splashed into a series of lily ponds surrounded by Oriental garden ornaments ( page 272 ) . This garden grew practically overnight . From New York City Huntington had approved the idea . That was in 1912 , and the California mansion had just been completed . The garden was to be ready by winter , when the owner and his wife planned to move in . " I searched desperately for Oriental plant , . through every nursery in California . " Mr. Hertrich recalled . " As a last resort , I turned to the owner of a commercial Japanese tea garden in Pasadena . He would n't sell me single plants . But he agreed to sell the whole garden . We transplanted the entire enterprise ? buildings , bridges , and ornaments . " Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the estate 's most popular corner . National Geographic Yhot. rapher J. Baylor Roberts  | Luncheon at the Huntington Library is an occasion shared with gardeners , guards , librarians , scholars from all parts of the country , and curators of paintings and rare books . The meal is served cafeteria style in a long building where Henry Huntington and his friends used to bowl and play billiards . Why Is " The Blue Boy " Blue ? Over a salad and ice cream , I got acquainted with William A. Parish , an expert on rare prints and Acting Curator of the art gallery until the appointment recently of Dr. Robert R. Wark . Later he guided me through his domain . Huntington had designed his house as an 18th-century Georgian palace , and here , on permanent display , are " Pinkie , " " The Blue Boy , " and some 40 other life-size portraits ( page 261 ) . The mansion is a shrine for the school of British painters that immortalized the elegance and charm of English aristocracy during the century that closed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most renowned canvas of this era of extravagance , wealth , and leisure should be " The Blue Boy . " The model for this familiar canvas was Jonathan Buttall , son of a London ironmonger . Of the nine lavishly costumed Gainsborough models that grace the hallways and salons of the art gallery ? so reminiscent of Versailles and other mansions of its day ? only " The Blue Boy " portrays a person who lacked rank , title , or social position ( page 253 ) . Some believe that Gainsborough painted the portrait as a reply to famous Sir Joshua Reynolds , who once contended that no portrait in the cold color of blue could possess the merits of a painting done in warmer tones . Gainsborough 's motive could not , however , 257  | have been to refute Reynolds , for Sir Joshua made his statement years after completion of " The Blue Boy . " Whether or not Gainsborough deliberately demonstrated that cold colors could be successful as the predominant tone in a portrait , it is true that thousands of Huntington visitors ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have seen ? stand silently respectful before the portrait 's compelling appeal . At one time " The Blue Boy " and " Pinkie " were hung on either side of a hand-carved door in the drawing room . Now they look at each other across the large air-conditioned New Gallery , built in 1934 . Thus the visitor can devote himself to them alternately . It is an unforgettable experience to turn from one to the other of this famous pair ? from Master Jonathan Buttall to Miss Sarah Moulton-Barrett , whose gown streams as loosely as her counterpart 's costume fits snugly , and whose radiation is as pinkly pink as " The Blue Boy " is blue . @# " Pinkie " is one of the finest paintings by Sir Thomas Lawrence , who became President of the Royal Academy in 1820 . It is one of six portraits by Sir Thomas in the Huntington galleries . One added reason for its glamour is that the child model was a sister of Edward Moulton-Barrett , the dour , tyrannical father of Elizabeth Barrett Browning , portrayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Pinkie 's Feet Many times I managed to pull my attention from " Pinkie " herself to concentrate on the quality of third dimension that Sir Thomas achieved in the clouds and the landscape behind his hilltop subject . Only a few inches of canvas at Pinkies feet show the hills rolling away behind her . But in those few inches , Sir Thomas leads the eye , through light and shadow and with exquisitely fine brushwork , on a journey that wanders 20 miles into the picturesque English countryside ( page 252 ) . Henry Huntington , feeling that no one could master the entire history of art , limited his effort to the paintings of one brief but brilliant period , the British 18th-century school . He surrounded his canvases with furniture , tapestries , statuary , porcelain , and other art objects that would contribute to a concept of that century . A divided marble staircase descends in two sweeping curves into the main hall . This , I thought , would be the proper backdrop for the entrance of a lady of nobility . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staircase appeared Gainsborough 's portrait of Penelope , Viscountess Ligonier ( next page ) . Embraced in the encircling arms of the stairs stood a life-sized bronze of the famous statue of Diana the Huntress by Jean-Antoine Houdon . Gleaming darkly against the white hallway , she seemed ready to leap from her pedestal with bow and arrow . A marble Diana by Houdon is in the Hermitage in @#  | Leningrad . Another bronze graces the Louvre in Paris . Several other statues by Houdon are in a special collection dedicated to the memory of Mr. Huntington 's wife , Arabella . One is the remarkably lifelike marble bust of Houdon 's young daughter . I had first seen a photograph of this statue , and it had haunted me . A retouching artist , I detected , had been at work on the negative of the child 's face . I wondered why . I also suspected that the eyes had been retouched , for they seemed to sparkle with life . Angelic Statue with a Dirty Face Mr. Parish and I went to the gallery to examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown smudges in the cheeks , just as if this angelic little girl might have had a dirty face . The overzealous retoucher evidently could not abide this defect . It may never be known whether Houdon unhappily ran into these smudges in the stone when it was too late to discontinue the work , or whether he chose a piece of blemished marble as a whimsical bit of realism . The eyes of the photograph , however , had not been tampered with , the statue itself proved . Unlike most marble figures , Houdon 's faces do not have blank , convex eyeballs . Instead , the iris and pupil are indented so that shadows make the eye seem natural . To complete his craftsmanship , Houdon also left protruding from the darkness of the iris a pinpoint of white marble that creates the uncanny effect of a highlight ( page 260 ) . I was curious about the care , cleaning , and preservation of these fabulously valuable art objects . Mr. Parish helped me understand this problem when I several times proposed moving a painting or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with indecision as he considered the restrictions laid down by insurance companies for handling the art treasures . " Sometime soon , " he said , " we 're going to remove The Blue Boy ' and the others in the New Gallery . We need to treat the backs of some of the canvases to make them impervious to moisture . And when we take them down , I 'll want six men handling each picture ! " I found that almost every piece of furniture , of porcelain , of bronze was bolted down or glued inside an earthquake-proof case . Fine wire made the glass of showcases shatterproof . When paintings came off the walls for repair or cleaning by professional restorers , Mr. Parish hovered over them with anxious concern . To avoid the hazards of moving them even to the estate 's workshop , some art objects are cleaned and restored in the galleries . I was able then to photograph this operation in the French room of the Arabella Huntington memorial collection , and to include as background one of five tapestries after designs by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more than 500 pieces in the art gallery and the memorial collection . In addition there are nearly 200,000 rare books in the library , and more than a million rare manuscripts , letters , and maps in a separate section of the stacks . The library also contains more than 150,000 reference works , which scholars use to assist their studies among the rare books . Books Keep Cool Behind Bars Rare books are issued to readers through a grill in heavy steel doors for which only a few keys exist . After scrutiny of my credentials , the attendant allowed me to enter these doors , and I signed the same declaration to abide by the rules that is signed by the researchers who come here to work . Even Dr. John E. Pomfret , Director of the institution , is subject to the rules for care and preservation of the rare books and documents . One day he was reprimanded by an alert librarian in the rare book reading room when he absent-mindedly pulled from his pocket a ball-point pen . Readers may use only pencils or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volumes . Curator Schad admitted me from the stifling heat of a summer day into the delicious coolness of the rare book vault . @#  | " The air conditioning is not primarily for us human bookworms . " Mr. Schad said , though we do enjoy coming back here on hot days . The temperature is maintained at 68 ? F. , primarily to discourage the work of real bookworms . They remain dormant below about 70 ? " ( page 270 ) . Bookworms ? actually a wide variety of insects and their larvae ? are a constant menace to libraries . Particularly do they infest old books . What the bookworm likes most is the glue in bindings . " Every new item is fumigated in a vacuum chamber , " said Carey S. Bliss , Assistant Curator of Rare Books . " The vacuum ensures that the deadly methyl bromide will reach every cranny in the bindings and between the leaves . " Then he unlocked a steel-and-plate-glass case and withdrew , from between cardboards that prevent rare books from scratching each other , a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author was a bibliophile named William Blades ; the title was The Enemies of Books . These enemies Blades listed as " fire , water , gas and heat , dust and neglect , ignorance and bigotry , the bookworm , other vermin , bookbinders , collectors , servants and children . " Aged Volumes Seldom . Rebound Blades waxed eloquent and extremely caustic over the depredations of bookbinders . " Dante , " he wrote , " in his Inferno , ' deals out to the lost souls various tortures suited with dramatic fitness to the past crimes of the victims , and had I to execute judgment on the criminal binders of certain precious volumes I have seen ... I would collect the paper shavings so ruthlessly shorn off , and roast the perpetrator of the outrage over their slow combustion . " Mr. Bliss agreed with Blades that bookbinders , under certain circumstances , could be classed as enemies of books . The Huntington Library maintains its own bindery , but very seldom is a really rare or valuable book repaired in any way . Much of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binding , however deteriorated that may be . As we talked , the owners of two other keys joined us in the vault . They were Head Librarian Leslie E. Bliss , father of Carey , and Herbert C. Schulz , Curator of Manuscripts . Librarian Bliss told me he devotes much of his time to making further acquisitions for the Huntington collection . At an annual cost of nearly $100,000 , books and manuscripts arrive from all over the world . Mr. Schulz pushed aside a sliding steel door and led me into a corridor lined with cages of steel mesh . Some Manuscripts Still Uncatalogued Behind the locked doors were letters in the handwriting of Mary Queen of Scots . Sir Walter Raleigh , George Washington . and Abraham Lincoln . In another cell were manuscripts by Shelley , Keats , Byron , Kipling , Conrad , and Poe . In still others were documents signed by such men as William Penn and John Hancock . " It is easy to come back here and become completely lost in these people , " Mr. Schulz said . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night , you might forget to come out . You follow a man 's letters , his daily hopes and plans . You get all excited . Then the story is suddenly cut short : the next letter is missing ! " Mr. Huntington , in his purchase of large private collections , gathered a million such manuscripts , " Mr. Schulz went on . " So many we still do not have them all catalogued . " It is remarkable that so many old manuscripts have survived . During the Reformation of the 16th century , when monasteries were abolished in England , shiploads of manuscripts ? mostly on animal skins in those days ? were moved to the Continent . There they were boiled down to make soap , made into polishing cloths , and put to other strange uses . As for paper manuscripts , they often became wrappings for the wares of butchers and fishmongers , and linings for the pans of bakers .

Boyer , National Geographic Staff S.G.S.  | Fortunately for the cause of scholarship , many medieval writings were somehow preserved . " For some of their most esteemed work , manuscript writers used squirrel or rabbit vellum , reduced to the thickness of onionskin . Skins of unborn calves and lambs also made fine vellum . On such fragile sheets , monks of the Middle Ages penned books with filigree tracery that remains as brilliant today as it was 500 years ago ( page 271 ) . Italian craftsmen made the finest manuscript vellum . They washed , scraped , and pumiced the skins , and often used only the flesh side as a writing surface . A Workshop for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before losing myself among the fascinating first editions of the rare book stacks and among the scribblings of great authors in the manuscript files . We took a last deep breath of cool air and went out into the rare book reading room . Here were shirt-sleeved doctors of philosophy doing research for books on English and American letters . Some were digging into the kind of material for which the Huntington Library is particularly renowned ? the history and literature of the American West . A reader from a California university was studying the dime novels of the early West . Another was researching soldier life in the Mexican war . A third was looking into the e of Jack London . Subjects here range widely over the AngloAmerican scene . Some scholars were interted in one or more of the facets of Shakespeare . The Huntington Library holds one of the world 's finest collections of Shakespeare first editions and related materials . En this Country only the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington . ll .

On these shelves one may find copies . f 20 percent of the books published in the United States before 1801 plus a large collection of books published elsewhere concerning the Americas up to that time . With their importance to serious scholarship , the library 's facilities have to be limited to those qualified readers interested in what Henry Huntington called " the advancement of learning ... study and research in original sources .... " More than 600 scholars use the library each year . Most of them produce books or doctoral theses from their researches . The library also offers fellowships and grants to help researchers pursue their studies . In addition , books , magazine articles , and pamphlets are written by members of the library staff . Mr. Wright showed me shelves of bound facsimiles of rare books , used as substitutes to protect extremely valuable items from excessive handling . At least a thousand volumes in the Huntington vaults are unique . In an average year the library 's photographic staff makes 70,000 microprints and photographs of rare volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelves are not open to the casually interested public , some of the finest of the library prizes are displayed in glass cases for general view . Representing the Shakespeare collection is a copy of the First Quarto of Hamlet , published in 1603 , twenty years before the First Folio , the earliest collected edition of Shakespeare 's plays . The British Museum has the only other known copy of this Hamlet . The first editions of Shakespeare 's individual plays are known as the Quartos ; the Huntington Library has copies of all but one ( page 270 ) . Gutenberg Bible a Prime Attraction Among the most fascinating items are those venerable volumes known as incunabula ? books printed before 1501 . Of these the Gutenberg Bible is the primary attraction to visitors . The two volumes are printed on vellum , probably sheepskin , and bound between heavy wooden boards . Over the boards is stretched the original 15th-century stamped leather , held fast by metal bosses . This Bible takes its name from Johann Gutenberg , the reputed inventor of printing in Europe , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movable metal type . There are some 40 other surviving copies , although most of them are on paper rather than vellum . As I photographed the wonders of the Huntington Library and Art Gallery , I began to feel the fascination that lures scholars ever deeper into secrets of the rare book and manuscript vault .  | There was , for example , the strange manuscript of Edgar Allan Poe 's essay , " About Critics and Criticism . " It is written on pieces of paper four inches wide and fastened together in 14 places by adhesive wafers : the whole is 144 inches long . Poe 's parents were actors . Possibly they used scrolls like this in rehearsal ; such a rolled manuscript was called a " part . " Poe may have tried adapting this theatrical device to his writing . Even more intimate an insight into a private life was a little manuscript from the girlhood of Charlotte Bronte. author of Jane Eyre . Charlotte . her brother . and her sisters ( Emily wrote Wuthering Heights ) had little contact with other children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once they started a magazine 276 for an audience of .

It is called " Corner Dishes ? Being a Small Collection of Mixed and Unsubstantial Trifles in Prose and Verse . " by Lord Charles Albert Florian Wellesley . The name was one of Charlotte 's pseudonyms . There are ? we measured them ? 16 lines of handwriting to the inch . As the space between her lines is of an equal depth . it means that Charlotte 's penmanship is only 1 /32 of an inch tall . And , when you examine her work closely , it is eminently legible : Yes . I thought . one might easily become lost among the people whose books , manuscripts , and portraits live on in San Marino . California , in air-conditioned immortality . @# or . n of . 1 vet               @ @ @ @ @ @
