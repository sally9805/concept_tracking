On the stage of the Grand Music Hall of Basel , Switzerland one day last week sat two strange contraptions . One resembled a telephone switchboard with a set of loudspeakers attached . The other looked like a small spinet but was connected to two loudspeakers and a lute-shaped soundbox . The gadgets were known as the " Mixturtrautonium " and the " Ondes Martenot . " Both produce more or less musical tones electronically , and they were to be featured soloists in a concert for the delegates to the first International Congress of Electronic Music and Musique Concrte . <P> Slithery Glissando . The Mixturtrau-tonium , originally developed by a German physics professor in 1930 and later refined by Engineer-Composer Oskar Sala. is a complicated monster operated by pressing the fingers on two strings through which runs a weak electric current . By shifting his fingers along the strings much like a violinist and by working switches and pedals , the player can-at least theoretically-produce notes and pre-set chords of every imaginable color , frequency and strength . But so far the Mixturtrautonium can be played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a less versatile but considerably simpler instrument , is the brainchild of Maurice Martenot , a slight , bespectacled Frenchman with a bumblebee mustache and a practical outlook . The Martenot has been manufactured and sold ( 190 models at about $700 each ) , can be mastered in a few months , is already used by the Paris Opera and theaters . It has had 518 compositions written for it , some by such first-rate composers as Honegger and Milhaud . It utilizes a keyboard and a metalized ribbon that produces slithery glissandos , can control color and volume through other accessories , but can not play chords . <P> Incoherent Themes . His introduction of the Martenot in 1928 made Maurice Martenot a pioneer of electronics in music. * His argument : the orchestra can be made more subtle by use of an instrument capable of sounds that bridge the tonal gaps between strings and winds , give pitch to the dull thud of the bass drums , play lower than a double bass and higher than a piccolo . The idea has caught on : dozens of electronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RCA 's Synthesizer , unveiled four months ago , which can reproduce the sound of any musical instrument . <P> As the Basel concert opened , Mlle. Ginette Martenot , sister of the instrument 's builder , started off with the Ondes Martenot . With remarkable technique , she coaxed from the instrument a synthetic cascade of notes , often shrill , occasionally pleasant , accompanied by a wildly modernistic orchestral background . She got a big hand from the audience . After intermission , Oskar Sala sat down before his Mixturtrautonium . To a tape-recorded background of shrill whistles , gongs , rattles and electronic drum sounds , he compounded the cacophony with his wildly incoherent themes . A third of the audience left before the end ; those who stayed filled the hall with whistles and catcalls . Said a critic the next day : " As long as we do not have electronic ears , this noise must be qualified as inhuman . " <P> * In 1920 , Leon Theremin had exhibited the " Theremin , " prototype of all electronic instruments operated by varying the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
