txt The United States is prepared to sell France an atomic submarine engine . But the French are not overly impressed , pointing out that Washington made a general offer to all North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations to be of assistance in developing nuclear submarines . France is thinking , understandably at this moment , of " prestige . " This means not only nuclear weapons of its own , but missiles of its own , a larger share in production of NATO weapons generally ? in short , a position in the alliance approximating that of Britain .
