In his first six months on the job , Paul Butler , the new Democratic National Chairman , has traveled more than 30,000 miles to meet party leaders and make friends . Along the way he has suffered some minor mishaps . In Georgia , just as he was beginning to read a prepared speech , he broke his glasses ; at a Mississippi dinner , a waiter spilled four glasses of milk over him , and at a California rally , a leading Democrat publicly insulted him ( TIME . April 4 ) . Last week in Texas , Democrat Butler walked , with his eyes wide open , into real trouble : he made the party split - which was healing - break open again . <P> Sacrificial Calf . Recently some top Democrats have been working quietly to heal the breach between the National Committee and Governor Allan Shivers , who helped swing Texas to Eisenhower in 1952 . Last month , during a Capitol Hill breakfast given by the Speaker of the House , " Mr. Sam " Rayburn of Texas , Chairman Butler and Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informal peace pact . Shivers privately agreed to choose a new national committeeman from Texas in place of his friend , Wright Morrow , long rebuffed by the National Committee . <P> Morrow , who heard about the arrangement , brooded about his role as sacrificial calf . Loyalist Texas Democrats , who want Shivers ' scalp , were equally upset by the dealings between him and the national party . Amidst the rumbling , Chairman Butler announced.his plans for a visit to Texas . His sponsors : the violently anti-Shivers Democratic Advisory Committee . Under the circumstances , his trip , hailed as a " peace mission , " was likely to be anything but . <P> Most Texans in Congress knew nothing about Butler 's plans until it was too late . Speaker Sam Rayburn , who did know , hopefully sent word to Hilda Weinert , the state national committeewoman. one of the few Texas Democrats friendly with both Shivers and the National Committee . He wanted her to help avoid trouble " in working out Mr. Butler 's schedule . " She tried to arrange a meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loyalist leadership balked , and the Shivers Democrats decided to boycott arriving Chairman Butler . Snapped Mr. Sam , " I ca n't make people cooperate . " <P> Invitation to Uvalde . The day after Butler landed in Texas , the Fort Worth Star-Telegram ran a big , black headline : PARTY FEUD ERUPTS . Governor Shivers indignantly announced that Butler had refused an invitation to lunch in Austin . Drawing a bead on Butler , the governor labeled the refusal " regrettable for the future of the Democratic Party . " Replied Butler : " I will be happy if the governor comes " - to see Butler .
