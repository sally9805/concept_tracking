txt Full stabilization of the French franc and the removal of exchange controls have been discussed lately in official circles . There have been reports that these steps may be done next autumn and that the stabilization may involve a fixed exchange rate with the dollar . In connection with this discussion the comment has been made that the European payments union , which is expected to be approved soon , is a mere temporary device since it entails convertibility of only continental European currencies and the pound , the real objective being complete convertibility of all currencies . The payments union has keen criticized by central bankers on the ground it may actually retard full convertibility by tending to crystallize the present monetary situation . It is therefore pertinent to clarify the positions of the French franc and of the payments union , which have been somewhat befogged in much of the discussion . As for the French franc , the burst of optimism is attributable to two facts : the fall in the price of gold in terms of the French franc so . that - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fall of the dollar in the black market so that it approaches the rate in the official market ? thanks partly to the seasonal influence of tourist sales of dollars . From these facts some have inferred the franc was so strong it could stand alone at a fixed parity with the dollar and gold . This is the view of some bankers . Other observers , official and nonofficial , contend the franc is not so strong as it may appear . They point to a prospective deficit in this year 's budget of per- : haps $600,000,000 , to the fact military expenditures are not yet fixed , to the fact the political situation is unstable , and above all to the fact that France has reached her present financial position with the aid of gifts of approximately $1,500,000,000 in the last two years . The question is asked : Can the franc be stabilized at the present rate without reliance upon this dollar aid , the drawing rights that it financed within the Marshall Plan or the counterpart fund that accompanied it and enabled the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund represents francs received by the Government from the sale of Marshall Plan goods in France . The money is kept in a special account and is used for reconstruction and modernization programs . When United States officials speak ' of convertibility  --  which is the goal they set in proposing the payments union , ? they mean convertibility without an influx of free dollars to support , European currencies by covering European trade deficits . Latitude in Convertibility While a payments union would provide for convertibility only among European currencies , it would not prevent any country that could do so from making its currency convertible also with the dollar or gold . Thus it would not defer or restrain full convertibility , in the opinion of its sponsors , although it provides for a maximum of European nations moving together in that direction at a pace suitable to all . Thus there is noticing to prevent the French from pegging their franc to the dollar except their deficit in dollar trade , their unbalanced budget , and the uncertainty that their progress toward a fully liberal monetary system can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate and in the present form . In discussions of the payments union here , which are expected to come to a head next week , there has been agreement that the British proposals for discriminatory import restrictions in favor of extreme debtor countries and against extreme creditors should be dropped . However , it has been agreed that when a country 's gold reserves run out it may impose import restrictions but only on a general basis applying to all countries . Since gold reserves might be Iost through bad internal policies as well as through other causes , the question has arisen as to who should decide when any country required trade controls . Some conten &; the decision should not rest with the country concerned but with an international authority such as the payments union . This issue will go before the ministers . Another discriminatory element seemed removed by an agreement that lists of goods to be free from import quotas should apply to all countries , not to specific countries . Such lists were to be prepared by next January .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
