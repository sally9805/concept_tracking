The intense , square-jawed Chinese artist stared fixedly at the rice paper taped to the wall , his wolf-and-goat-hair brush poised in his hand like a dart . Suddenly he reached to the top of the paper , in four bold downward strokes brushed in four broad segments of a bamboo stalk . He quickly dipped the brush again in the porcelain bowl of mixed water and ink , drew a long soaring line in one continuous , caressing gesture to form the narrow bamboo shoot , then rapidly brushed in the broad leaves . In two minutes , 40 seconds the painting was completed . As Huang Chun-pi turned smiling to face the crowded room , the audience burst into applause . Thus Formosa 's leading landscape artist and teacher last week demonstrated his technique in the lecture room of Manhattan 's China House , crowded to overflowing with curious Manhattan artists and Huang 's old pupils . The occasion : Professor Huang 's first exhibition in the U.S. , some 40 landscape paintings . <P> Professor Huang , now 59 , got part of his early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose " Studio of Pines and Snow " was a collector 's hangout famous throughout China . A recognized painter by the time he was 20 , Huang spent the Nationalist government 's long wartime exile in Chungking teaching and making sketching trips along the wild and misty mountain gorges of the Kialing River . He went to Formosa in 1948 as a member of a good-will mission just before Communists seized control of Nanking 's National Central University , where he was teaching , refused to return to the mainland , is now chairman of the art department of Taipei 's Provincial Teachers College . <P> Five years ago Huang began teaching a distinguished pupil , Mme. Chiang Kaishek . For her , Huang prescribed the classical program , began with trees , then rocks . After two years she had mastered the basic strokes and was ready for color , now specializes in painting bamboo and pines . " She has made great progress . " beams Huang . " Her strokes are very forceful , even stronger than a man 's . " <P> To celebrate his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly from Los Angeles to Yosemite National Park . Once there , he leaped from the car and began a watercolor on the spot ( see cut ) . How does the scenery compare with his beloved Kialing River ? Replies Huang : " The landscape is not too different . But American trees are too uniform ; Chinese trees are more interesting . What I missed most was the mist . " For Huang this presented no insuperable problem . He simply left blank areas of rice paper to indicate the mist , in one view added two Chinese fishermen in the bed of Yosemite 's Merced River , for good measure .
