For 17 years the U.S. Government has been attempting to deport Harry Renton Bridges , a native of Australia , whose rise to labor leadership-he has bossed West Coast longshoremen since 1934-was achieved with Communist help . The basic complaint : that Bridges himself is a troublemaking Communist . <P> Backed by his International Longshoremen 's and Warehousemen 's Union , Bridges beat the Government in 1939 , 1945 and 1953 . Last month in San Francisco , the Government gave Bridges another whirl . It sought his deportation on the grounds that he had lied in denying he was a Communist , or had been a Communist , during his naturalization in 1945 . <P> Last week , the day after Bridges ' 54th birthday , Federal Judge Louis E. Goodman read his ten-page verdict . Its substance : the Government had failed to prove Bridges ' " membership in the Communist Party by clear and convincing evidence . " " How 's that for a birthday present , Harry ? " shouted a longshoreman . Grinned Bridges : " That 's great . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
