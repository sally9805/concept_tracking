When aging Harry F. Sinclair stepped out of the presidency of the Sinclair Oil Corp . in early 1949 , his company was held in small esteem on Wall Street . Over it still hovered some of the onus of Harry Sinclair 's jailing for contempt in the Teapot Dome oil scandal of the ' 20s . And in its later years the company seemed to have developed hardening of the corporate arteries . It lagged behind in expanding its production and oil reserves . <P> Percy C. Spencer , an ex-Wyoming ranch hand turned lawyer who stepped into Harry Sinclair 's shoes , soon had the company prancing like a yearling bronco . Spencer had been the company 's general counsel since 1943 ; he was no expert on production , but he knew how to organize it . He launched Sinclair on a five-year $250 million expansion , picked up some 2,000,000 acres of unproved oil leases , started a big drilling program . To make its 13,500-mile pipeline network even bigger , he put the company to work this year on a new 700-mile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spencer 's rejuvenation paid off . Sinclair 's crude oil production has risen 25% . Earnings last year climbed from $54 million in 1949 to $70.1 million , and are still climbing . In 1951 's first quarter , they reached $18.3 million , $5,000,000 more than in the same quarter last year . Sinclair stock , which had dropped to 18 ? the year Spencer took over , has shot up to 39 , the highest point since 1929 . <P> At 57 , " Spence " Spencer still has his eye on the future . Last week when he gave a luncheon to announce his latest stake in it , some of Wall Street 's most potent bankers attended : Chase National 's Winthrop Aldrich , J. P. Morgan 's Henry C. Alexander , National City 's Howard C. Shepherd . So did a New Dealer , Senator Joseph C. O'Mahoney , a friend of Spencer 's Wyoming days . Spencer 's news made both bankers and New Dealer applaud . <P> Sinclair , announced Spencer , will open the facilities of its huge Harvey , Ill. research laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of petroleum . The company will test such ideas free of charge , and if the results justify it , provide the technicians and money for research to push them to completion . In return , the inventor will be required to let Sinclair use the process royalty-free , but since the inventor holds the patent , he may also sell it to anybody else . The news was hardly out before scores of ideas began flooding Sinclair 's Manhattan offices . An inventor in Plymouth , Wis. phoned in his idea to use asphalt in making metal molds . Another inventor in Chicago phoned in his scheme for a new use of oil in the ceramics industry . Some sounded promising , others did not . All will get careful attention . Said Spencer : " You ca n't afford to ignore the crackpot . His work may turn out to be the gold pot . "
