txt Congress feels just as It always has about foreign aid  --  only more so . The usual tough sledding for the President 's foreign aid program promises to he even tougher this year . The President 's annual foreign aid message has not yet been sent to Capitol Hill , but legislators have already furnished a sneak preview of its probable recept This came in a sensational slashing of the Presidential request for 5225,000,000 for the Development Loan Fimd to carry it . through the end of the fiscal year to June 30 . A Mina , Appropriations sub  --  ommittee took one long , disapproving look at the figure , and cut it to $50.000.000 ! Yet . the amount . proposed by the President is not for charity , not . for give-aways . It is aid in the from of 40- , ans to he repaid eventually in the form of currency .

India , for instance , is seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-year development plan . The capital of the Development Loan Fund has been depleted and the President 's request for a supplemental appropriation was to keep the fund in active business for the remainder of the year . The 5175.000,000 cutback in the President 's request represented particularly rough handling by Congress .

Or that some adjustment might , be made from the floor of the House when the bill comes up there .

Although the Senate may deal more gently with the matter , this is typical of a congressional mood that casts long shadoFs before  --  shadows that fall upon the President 's full foreign aid program due to go up to Capitol Hill some time this week . The President 's budget provides $3,900,000,000 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this amount still to be spelled out in detail .
