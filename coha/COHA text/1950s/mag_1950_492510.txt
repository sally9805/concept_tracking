in the state of New York , where adul- tery is the only legal ground , infidelity is com- paratively seldom officially cited as the reason for divorce . On a national basis , it is listed as the cause in less than 8 per cent of the cases . But in the divorce survey made by Dr. William J. Goode , Wayne University sociologist , in Detroit , infidelity emerged as a factor in more than half the cases . That does not mean that Detroit is especially sinful . There is no reason to suspect that there is a higher proportion of unfaithful husbands and wives in that city than throughout the country . The seeming discrepancy lies in the fact that official figures include only the cases wherein the divorces were granted on that specific ground . Doctor Goode 's survey includes what divorced women frankly told or unwittingly admitted to his interviewers under expert questioning . In most cases where infidelity was involved the suit was not on that ground , because of the fear of disgrace or because absolute legal proof was hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband frequently stays out all or most of the night and the wife finds lipstick on his handkerchief or collar , she has little doubt that he is unfaithful . But proving it in court is another matter . And in a surprising number of cases , women apparently found infidelity easier to forgive than other actions . In cases where the wife was guilty , male chivalry or pride often kept the infidelity factor out of the court records . Sometimes the injured husband even allowed the wife to get the divorce on invented minor grounds . The high percentage of infidelity uncovered by careful study of Doctor Goode 's 425 ease histories  --  scientifically selected to give a picture typical of all divorces in the Detroit metropolitan area during two years  --  is supported by at least two other sources . One is the Kinsey report , which concluded that about one half of the husbands in this country had some time or another committed adultery . Evidence more closely applicable to the divorce picture comes from Judge Paul W. Alexander , of Toledo , one of the best-informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In most jurisdictions , the burden of handling divorce cases is split among several judges , whose minds are also occupied with a wide variety of other kinds of cases . In Toledo , all divorce suits and cases involving family disputes and children are heard by Judge Alexander . He also has built up a staff of expert assistants to help him dig deeply into the background of the cases . Among other advantages of such a setup , he is able to keep accurate and realistic statistics even on matters which do not always appear on the surface . His records show that nearly 46 per cent of the divorce cases he has handled in the last few years involved unfaithful husbands , and 21 per cent involved unfaithful wives . Again , there is no indication that these startling percentages are due to local factors or that infidelity is more rampant in Toledo than in any other urban industrial setting . The percentage of cases involving unfaithful wives , however , is probably somewhat too high for normal times . Since it is drawn from judge Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Domestic Relations Court . the records for the years 1945-48 , it is affected by the results of wartime marriages and the enforced separations of war . In other words , the cases wherein men returned from war to find their wives had strayed . Since the peak in 1946 , that figure has been declining . The cases involving unfaithful wives were 20 per cent in 1945 , 23 per cent in 1946 , 22.1 per cent in 1947 , and 19 per cent in 1948 . On the other hand , the cases involving unfaithful husbands seem on the rise . They were 42 per cent in 1945 , 45.8 per cent in 1946 , 47.6 per cent in 1947 , and 47.8 per cent in 1948 . Those are shocking figures , and the whole subject of infidelity is dangerous ground . There are people who object to the discussion of facts even if they are proved and cry for an airing . There was a time when there was objection even to discussing cancer . But in any realistic examination of today 's alarming divorce rate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though adultery is a sin in every major religion in this country and ground for divorce in every state , not every discovered case of adultery leads to a divorce suit . Therefore the question of whether infidelity should be listed as one of the basic causes of divorce or as a symptom of marriages that already had something wrong with them is still being debated . Doctor Goode 's case histories , though gathered primarily for data on the problems of women PHOTOGRAPHY BY FRANK ROSS after divorce , furnish perhaps the most valuable evidence on that point ever obtained . That does not mean they settle the question . Like most social scientists , Doctor Goode considers infidelity as almost always a symptom , but he does not offer these case histories as proof of that theory . Their value is that they show how a representative group of divorced women reacted to infidelity . The reactions ranged from that of the young woman who was so shocked when she discovered her husband 's infidelity that she tried to kill herself , to the almost calm acceptance of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other complaintii . A few were through with their husbands the moment they found out about a single lapse ; a few seemed to have been willing to put up with even chronic infidelity , getting divorces only because their husbands demanded them . In between  --  and the nearest to an average reaction  --  were such eases as that of the woman who said , " You know how it is . The first time you are heartbroken , but let him talk you into forgiving . The second time you yell at him . The third time you have had too much . " At least 90 per cent of the women who faced the problem of infidelity had tried forgiving or shutting their eyes to their husbands ' actions . One woman said she had forgiven him seven times , hoping each time that this time his promises would be kept . Another woman started and dropped divorce proceedings five times before finally deciding he was hopeless . It must be remembered that all these cases involved children , and a woman with children usually will put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorcing their father . Since the survey was confined to cases which ended in divorce , it furnishes no evidence on how often forgiveness is followed by reform . The women who left their husbands immediately were usually young women who said they were still very much in love with their husbands at the time they discovered their unfaithfulness . For them , of course , the emotional shock was greatest . The worst shock and the hardest decision was in the case of the young wife who left her husband immediately when she caught him philandering , started divorce proceedings , then discovered she was pregnant . She told no one . All by herself she fought out the problem of whether to forgive for the sake of the unborn child or to go through with the divorce . Her first horrified thought was an abortion , but her conscience and maternal instinct were too strong . But she also could n't bring herself to go back with a man " I 'd have to be sharing with everyone else . " Though she felt life the day of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a boy who looked like his father , was born three months after the divorce . Those circumstances made that case unique . But there were several cases in which young mothers went through with divorce after learning of one  --  and as far as they knew , the only ? instance of the husband 's unfaithfulness . One example was the case of a strictly reared and idealistic young woman who had made her husband and her two babies almost her sole interest in life . Most a ti thorilies consider infidelity a symptom of an unhappy marriage , or a basic instability of character , rather than a cause in itself . She trusted him completely , taking it for granted that " forsaking all others " meant the same thing to him that it did to her . When he told her that he had to work one night almost to dawn , she sweetly Sympathized with him . It was only by accident that she discovered he had spent that night at the apartment of a notoriously gay divorcee . The shock was So great that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had lost eighteen of her usual 115 pounds ; her eyes were large and haunted and shadowed ; her face was drawn tight ; she frequently had nightmares and could sleep only by taking strong sedatives . Despite her evident suffering , she saki she never Considered forgiving him . She had left him immediately and filed suit as soon as her parents had been able to find a lawyer for her . " I just could n't ever live with him again , " she told the interviewer , " after he shattered my ideals like that . " Then she began to cry again . " How could he have done that to me ? " she wailed . This case also illustrates the difficulty of classifying infidelity as a symptom or a cause . She insisted and apparently believed that his unfaithfulness was the direct and sole cause of that divorce . Further along in the interview , however , hints of earlier friction appeared . She evidently had sensed resentment in him for a long time . " Though I ca n't imagine why , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a wonderful house-keeper . I was a loving wife and mother . I never nagged him , even when he spent money which heknew we ought to save , on sports and buying drinks for his friends . " Symptom or cause ? A cynic might guess her righteousness had made her a bore , and that therefore his infidelity was a symptom . A highly moral person might agree with her that his unfaithfulness Left her no choice . A sophisticate might claim she should n't have taken the lapse so seriously ; and others might argue that , regardless of how she felt about it , she should have forgiven him for the sake of the children . A psychiatrist might take her cry , " How could he have done that to me ? " as indicative of self-pity rather than outraged morality , or might find even deeper ; darker hints in it . Some might say that the point was that a man who could thus betray a woman who had dedicated her life to him was a beast , and that therefore the sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children . On the other extreme from those two cases was the divorcee who gave a long list of troubles when asked one of the early questions : " Would you state , in your own words , what was the main cause of your divorce ? " She said that he had a bad temper , that he started arguments over trifles , that he got drunk at parties , that he gambled , that he was a " mamma 's boy , " that her mother-in-law had interfered ; and , finally , that he had struck her during an argument . That , she said , was the end . The interview was more than four fifths over when she made a remark in passing which the interviewer did n't quite catch . " Excuse me , " the interviewer said . " You mean that he ran around with other women ? " " Oh , yes , " she replied . " But I rather expected that . All men are like that , are n't they ? " Neither the case nor her reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the women , even among those who gave adultery as the grounds , seemed to consider occasional lapses " in the nature of the beast . " This is confirmed by the fact that the so-called double standard has been more or less tacitly accepted for centuries ; examples of glossing such things over are frequent in the advice columns in women 's pages in many publications . On the other hand , there seems to be no scientific evidence that man is essentially promiscuous . Though some cultures have permitted polygamy and group marriage , there is no record of any primitive or " natural " society in which promiscuity was allowed among adults . Even in some tribes where youngsters were given sexual freedom , that stopped with marriage . Even apes are not promiscuous . That 's one reason most scientists consider infidelity a symptom of unhappy marriage , or basic instability of character , rather than a cause in itself . Nevertheless , the women seemed to find it easier to overlook promiscuity than a serious affair with a particular woman . Repeated but casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the serious affair sometimes hurt their pride even more , and always raised the fear of losing the husband to the other woman . Most of the women who were faced by the divorce . She refused . He threatened to go to another state and leave the children without support . " I thought of killing myself and I thought of killing him and I thought of killing that woman , " the wife told the interviewer . " Finally I decided divorce was the only solution . But it was n't any solution for me . " She burst into tears . " Please excuse me , " she said . " I ca n't help it . I feel bad all the time . " In most " older " cases the infidelity seemed to stem from what might be called a belated attack of youth ; a sort of frantic kicking up of the heels before it was too late . The husbands usually were several years older than the wives  --  some were ten or more years older  --  and the statistics show that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In one case the fifty-year-old father of grown children was very proud of the fact that on his good days he looked fifteen years younger . Apparently he sought to strengthen the illusion by marrying a smart-looking career girl of twenty-eight . In another case a fortytwo-year-old man got involved with an eighteen-year-old girl two months younger than one of his own daughters , but already experienced and somewhat of a gold digger . And there was a rase of a forty-six-year-old husband who insisted upon a divorce because he wanted to marry his nineteen-year-old secretary . In this case there was no threat of nonsupport , but the wife felt it was " cheap and degrading " to insist on keeping legal chains on a husband who no longer loved her and wanted his freedom . " But I think now I was wrong , " she told the interviewer . " I should have waited it out . I know a woman who did that under even worse circumstances . She refused to divorce him even though the girl was pregnant by him . Finally he came'to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admittedly incomplete , since in this survey the case histories were drawn mainly from the wives thernselves : ' Naturally the guilty wives were reluctant to talk ; and some of them , not realizing the interviewers had other ways of checking on them , lied outright . Five of them , however , were quite frank . One of them was brazenly a man hunter ; she even made passes at the interviewer . A second one said , " My husband was cheating , so I got even with him by stepping out myself . " The three others complained of neglect by their husbands  --  a complaint which was frequent even in cases where the wife was above suspicion . " All he ever thought of was his business , " said one of these three . " He never wanted to go anywhere or do anything . I was cooped up in the house all day . I was young , but I knew I would n't stay young forever . I did n't mean anything serious , but  --  well , there was a man I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another . " On the back of the report on this case the interviewer wrote : " I 'm con. vinced she 's telling the truth . She was lonely and for a little while she was convinced she was in love with the other guy . Now she is obviously heartbroken and bitterly sorry . In tracing her  --  she had moved singe the divorce suit started ? I ran into the husband . We talked for only a few minutes , but I got the impression he still loves her and only his male pride keeps him from taking her back . The two kids are sweet , but they look forlorn and bewildered . I hate to think what will hap , pen to them psychologically when they ( Continued on rage 46 ) ( Coat ' eil from Page 12 ) understand why their father and mother broke up . " The interviewer was so disturbed by the evident longing of all members of that family for each other that he was tempted " to butt in and try to do something about it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He may have been right , though the percentage of husbands who forgive errant wives is extremely small compared to that of wives who forgive their husbands . From time immemorial adultery by a woman has been looked upon as immeasurably worse than the same deed by a man . This double standard for the same moral sin has , among other things , a biological basis . Even the most experienced counselors on marital problems approach cases involving infidelity by the wife with less hope , and when the woman is obviously a hussy they do n't even try . But this writer found several cases where , under almost identical circumstances as in the case above , expert counselors brought about happy reconciliations . If even marriages apparently ruined by the wife 's infidelity can be salvaged , what would happen if all couples heading for the divorce courts could be given the opportunity or forced to talk over their troubles with an expert ? Perhaps the best way to approach that question is for the time being to drop the problem of infidelity ? which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the divorce problem as a whole . The most significant conclusion to emerge from Doctor Goode 's survey is that most of those shattered marriages and broken homes were needless tragedies . There were no unsolvable basic difficulties in most of the cases . Impulse , pride , anger , stubbornness and misunderstandings led the couples into divorces which deep down they did n't really want . There is considerable evidence that at least half of those divorces could have been averted if somebody had stepped in at the right moment and talked sense to them . Even simply talking about their marital troubles to the interviewers in this survey made some of the women see them in a different light . " I wish I could have talked to somebody like you before it was too late , " one woman exclaimed , after trying to explain why she got a divorce . " I see now how we could have worked it out and been happy . " The interviewer had n't done a thing except ask prepared questions and be a good listener . If the implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated that this country 's shocking divorce rate , the highest in the world , could be cut at least 60 per cent if we tried to cure sick marriages by expert treatment instead of rushing them into the execution chamber of divorce . Computed on a national basis , the suffering and waste of human happiness that might have been averted become staggering . Even after allowing for regional differences in the divorce rate and other factors , the indications emerging from Doctor Goode 's survey mean that , if true , in 1948 alone up to 200,000 marriages , involving the happiness of some 400,000 adults and 150 , - 000 children , might have been saved . It means that in the past ten years perhaps 2,000,000 divorces might have been avoided and 1,500,000 more children would have had the advantages of homes with two parents . The implications of the survey seemed so startling that to check them this writer laid the results of the survey in rough form before judges , ministers , divorce lawyers , social workers , psychiatrists and others experienced in marital problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved , more sharply and clearly than anything ever ( Coat intied on Note 18 ) ( Continued f Page 46 ) had done before , what they had come to believe from their own experiences . " I 'll go even further than your fifty per cent , " said a man who had spent forty years as a divorce specialist , first as a lawyer and then as a judge . " I 'm convinced that at least two thirds of the people who start divorce suits are really hoping that something will stop them before it is too late . They insist they want a divorce , but at the same time they are wishing that somebody will step in and straighten things out . The tragedy is that in most cases nobody does . " But the strongest corroboration of what Doctor Goode 's survey indicated came from the files in some of the few places where an official effort is made to reconcile couples seeking divorce . For almost all the divorce-case histories in the survey there were practically identical cases where intelligent , patient counseling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couples and their children . The cases were so much alike except for the endings that if there had been only a few they could have been dismissed as freakish coincidences . But this writer found numerous parallels in Toledo , Cleveland , and even in Detroit itself ; and in reports from Cincinnati , Milwaukee , Chicago and other places where the courts have set up counseling services at least on a small , experimental scale . Similar examples exist in the files of church , charitable and private agencies which try , within their limited funds and opportunities , to reconcile estranged couples . It became obvious that the seemingly too-perfect coincidences occurred simply because human nature is the same everywhere and the basic causes of marital discord are very few . When a man and wife have trouble with each other , they usually are sure that their difficulty is extra special , and each considers the other a uniquely triple-dyed villain or misfit . But at the very same moment thousands of other couples are quarreling over the same thing , in monotonously the same manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the experienced counselors the cases reduce to the same theme : two otherwise fairly decent people are antagonistically working at cross-purposes and doing nasty things which hurt themselves and their children . Why ? There was a case in Toledo which came to the attention of Judge Alexander , head of the Domestic Relations Court there , right after the wife went to a lawyer with a list of complaints which would have won her a divorce in virtually any court in the country . This lawyer knew that Judge Alexander had set up what he called a Marriage Counseling Setvice in connection with his court . He telephoned the judge , who turned the case over to Dr. Harriet L. Goldberg , his chief counselor on such problems . At first glance , reconciliation seemed impossible . The wife was militantly insistent upon a divorce and vehemently positive it was all his fault . She could prove that he was selfish , that he was an outrageously domineering martinet , that he had a violent temper , that the two children were afraid of him , that he sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doctor Goldberg has a Ph.D . from Bryn Mawr in psychiatric social work , fifteen years ' experience in the field and , perhaps most important of all , is a good listener . Her methods vary with the nature of the problem and the personalities of the people , but always she first lets them talk and talk and talk . This gives them what psychologists call a " psychic catharsis . " Having got their bottled-up complaints off their chests , they are more ready to listen to reason . Usually their own versions give the clues to the underlying factors which led that marriage to the brink of divorce . And often their own words lead them to begin to see possible flaws in themselves . Then the problem is already almost solved . In this case the battling had started right with the honeymoon and continued for more than nine years . The quarrels were set off by practically the whole range of frictions which people already angry at each other can magnify into major causes . The culmination was in a two-phase battle which started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . He retorted that her dinners were " no damn good anyway " ; that she cooked only to suit herself and never made any of the dishes he liked . One word led to another and to nasty remarks , and that phase of the battle roared through half the night . The next morning the spark that renewed it . was the fact that their eight-year-old son said he did n't want his oatmeal . The father harshly ordered him to eat every bit of it . The child began to cry . The mother tried to comfort him . The father turned on her , accusing her of spoiling the children . She retorted that his temper made the child so nervous that he could n't eat . Frightened by the quarreling , the child ran and hid in the bedroom . Both parents followed . When the mother bent to see if he was under the bed , the husband angrily shoved her . She fell and hurt her head . That did it . She took the children and went home to mother . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as militantly convinced that his wife was in the wrong . But as he talked , she detected a real longing for his wife and children . She already had seen signs of a basic feeling for the husband in the wife . Without that , reconciliation would have been almost impossible and perhaps a bad thing . Expert counselors do n't claim that they can reconcile all cases or that it is always wise . But , despite surface bitterness , some feeling for each other usually exists between two people who have lived together for years and had children . Listening to both sides , Doctor Goldberg saw that beneath the tawdry details there was the same old familiar pattern found at the root of most broken marriages . Each had entered marriage with the wrong slant , expecting too much of the other . She had dreamed of a husband who would " baby " her , who would make her every wish his law . He had expected a wife who would subordinate her desires to his and devote herself to making him comfortable and happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not realizing that happiness starts from within and that successful marriage requires two people to work at it , each had left the problem of adjustment entirely up to the other . When neither fulfilled the other 's illusions , each felt betrayed by the other , and resentment of each other naturally resulted . The resentments couldhave been expressed in any of the forms usually listed in divorce suits . In this case the form of his actions apparently had been dictated by two factors . One was that he believed that some of his problems as a young man were due to the fact that he had n't had enough discipline in his childhood . His harshness with the children , which the wife cited as a proof of his bad character , was actually a misguided effort to save them from the troubles he had experienced . " After all , if he did n't love them , " Doctor Goldberg pointed out , " why would he care if they ate their oatmeal ? " The other factor , which Doctor Goldberg also suggested to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who needed a lot of affection ; who craved approval and encouragement . That is always a good gambit , but one which can back-fire if not true . In this case the counselor was able to use it confidently because she had dug deeply into his past and had found clear indications that , though he was no sniveling weakling , he was unusually hungry for such things . The counselor knew she was close to a solution of that case when , near the end of the fourth session , the wife remarked , as if to herself , " Strawberry shortcake . I get hives from strawberries . But I remember how he hugged and kissed me when I made it one day . He acted just like a silly boy . " The husband was due at the counseling service a half hour later . He was a shop foreman . In previous sessions , Doctor Goldberg had led him to talk about his work until he explained to her how much tact , diplomacy and practical psychology he used to handle his men . Gradually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or blame , but by almost na  --  ve-sounding questions , she had led him to see that he was n't using the same skills at home that he displayed at the shop ; that he was n't working as hard and intelligently at his marriage as he was at his job . Now , when he came in again , Doctor Goldberg told him that his wife had just left in a soft mood and suggested that it might be smart for him to grab some candy or flowers and dash right over to see her . At this writing , thirteen months later , that couple looked like a good bet to stay happily married . In about one third of the survey cases , sex incompatibility was either named or indicated as a factor . In the typical reconciliation cited above , that factor was mentioned as the couple separately unburdened all their troubles to the patient counselors . In that case  --  and in many others  --  the sex incompatibility disappeared automatically , without any advice from the counselors on that point , when their other misunderstandings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the two psychiatrists to whom this writer showed the material for these articles . They said that except in extremely rare cases of serious physical abnormality , sex incompatibility was a state of mind rather than a physical fact . " The incompatibility lies elsewhere , " one of the psychiatrists ex ( Cam tin ned on Page 52 ) ( Con ql from Pagt. 18 ) plained . " If a reasonably normal couple are in love or even if they only like each other , there can be no basic difficulty with sex . Of course , there may be early problems due to inexperience and lack of education . Even so , if they are compatible otherwise , they will arrive at a satisfactory sex life . In other words , what is often called ' sex incompatibility ' is a symptom , not a cause . " The technique the counselors use in the toughest problems ? the ones wherein the wife was guilty of infidelity ? starts , of course , with making sure that reconciliation seems likely to be best for all concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get his grievance off his chest . Though carefully avoiding the appearance of being calloused or casually condoning the transgression , the counselor lets the husband realize that it is n't a brand-new situation ; that he is n't the only husband to whom that has happened , and that in other cases it has n't meant the end of the world . The point of that is to soften the blow to his male ego . At the same time the counselor tries , not by direct charges but by gently leading questions , to help the husband see that , by his neglect , he may have been partly at fault . That last part  --  the sharing of blame  --  is a major one in most reconciliations , in all sorts of cases . The catch in the reconciliation examples cited above is that only a fraction  --  less than 1 per cent of all divorce cases  --  came before such experts . Most courts still handle divorce suits on a narrowly legalistic and assembly-line basis , with no real effort at salvage . However , there are sow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the approval of the American Bar Association which would drastically revise the whole approach to the divorce problem . It includes setting up what might be called " pre-divorce clinics " to attempt reconciliations in all cases . But , partly because of inertia and partly because of the expense , it will be a long time before such a proposal is widely adopted . Meanwhile there may be a value to this survey which even Doctor Goode did n't expect . All authorities concerned with the divorce problem to whom this writer showed the results of the survey pleaded for copies of the series to show to people considering divorce . " I 've been looking for a set of case histories like that for years , " said Judge Alexander . " When you try to warn people of what divorce really means and what life may be like afterwards , " said Judge Samuel H. Silbert , of Cleveland , " they think you 're just preaching . But if I could show them in black and white actual case histories like their own , it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What particularly intrigued them was the fact , indicated in previous articles , that most of the divorced women interviewed showed signs of regret . Some of the regret may , of course , have been nostalgia for the marriage as it was before the troubles began . But usually it was because they had belatedly discovered that there was as much ? often far more  --  trouble and unhappiness on the other side of the divorce fence . The vast majority had obviously gone into divorce without thinking through what it might entail . Their attitude is summed up in the words of one of the most intelligent and observant of the interviewers , a woman in her thirties with two children . " In practically all my cases , " she reported , " it became obvious that they had thought the divorce would automatically solve all their troubles . They were shocked and bewildered when they discovered that not only did n't it cure everything but it started a whole new set of problems and heartaches .
