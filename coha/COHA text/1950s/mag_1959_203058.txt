" The doubling of China 's food crops in a single year , " boasted Communist economists last October , " is one of the greatest victories of man over nature in history ! " Soviet Russia might talk of outproducing the U.S. , but Red China cockily promised to overtake Britain within a few years . Having herded 500 million people into the ant-heap life of " people 's communes , " Red China boasted that it had been able " completely to bury the so-called ' law of diminishing returns ' which bourgeois economists claim to be universally true . " <P> But last week came the shamefaced admission that so-called bourgeois economic laws were right , after all , and the Communists themselves perpetrators of an economic whopper . The Central Committee of the Communist Party , in a two-week meeting at the mountain resort of Kuling , formally conceded that nearly every one of it 's 1958 production figures had been false ( see box ) . And the errors were no small ones : if the new figures were to be trusted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35% gain in grain , not the 102% Peking had boasted of , and there had been a 28% increase in cotton , not 104% . The false claims had to be confessed so that the planners could sharply drop their targets for next year . The party 's communiqu put the blame for the false figures on " lack of experience in assessing and calculating output , " and gloomily blamed the lowered output on bad weather , and the fact that reaping , threshing and storing " were all done in a somewhat hurried manner . " <P> The new figures were a vindication for that small corps of Sino experts gathered in Hong Kong who , in the face of Chinese claims , had surmised a great failure and had reported food shortages in the cities while Peking was talking of vast stockpiles ( TIME , Dec. 29 et seq . ) . And , as many Western observers had already suspected , the highly touted backyard steel furnaces proved a fiasco . None of 3,000,000 tons produced was usable in industry , confessed Peking . Between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system had resulted only in pushing China 's luckless peasants beyond their endurance . The report made sober reading for those Asians who had believed Red China 's propaganda about the superiority of Communism as a way of swiftly industrializing a backward nation . <P> But with the admission of failure came a compulsive Communist need to label it a success . Red newspapers carried banner headlines crying , LONG LIVE THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD- and LONG LIVE THE PEOPLE 'S COMMUNES ! In city after Chinese city last week , party workers were ordered into the street to beat drums and lead parades " celebrating " what were really ghastly failures . Most ominous of all were the blistering attacks on " rightist opportunists , " i.e. , Communist officials who had protested that the scheduled leap forward was too far and too fast . Such opportunists , said the party , " are singing the same tune as the internal and external enemies who slander us , " and they are " the main danger of the moment . " Thus , if heads rolled in China for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heads of men who tried desperately to stave off the flop of the leap forward , not those who obstinately insisted on it .
