With Dr. Alfred Kinsey 's new book Sexual Behavior in the Human Female almost ready for publication , Missouri Synod Lutherans are preparing a kind of Kinsey report of their own . In 1950 the church 's Triennial Convention appropriated $25,000 for a 25-man research team to investigate Biblical references and Christian teaching on marriage and family life and what Lutherans think and do about it . In charge of the survey is 38-year-old Pastor Paul Hansen of St. John 's Lutheran Church in Denver , who expects to publish the full report in 1954 . Among the preliminary findings : * <P> Only 16% of young Lutheran bachelors ( age 16-20 ) admit to sexual intercourse ( whereas Kinsey found that , among nonchurchgoing Protestants in the same age bracket , 90% of grade-school-level males , 80% at high-school-level and 45% at college level had premarital intercourse ) . Among older nonmarried Lutherans ( age 31-35 ) , the figure jumped to 33% ( Kinsey 's figure : 59% ) . <P> 4% of young married Lutheran men ( age 16-20 ) admitted extramarital intercourse as against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-school-level males . <P> 64% of married Lutherans , but only 36% of the clergy , approve the use of contraceptive devices . <P> One in 20 Lutheran marriages ends in divorce , as opposed to the general Protestant average of one in ten , and the Catholic figure of one in 25 ( not counting annulments ) . <P> There was disagreement between laymen and clergy on what causes family dissension . Said the laity : finances , in-laws and disputes over child-training . Said the clergy : drink , sex and religion . <P> <P> *Based on a questionnaire given to 1% of the families in three Lutheran synods ( Missouri , Augustana , Evangelical ) , it covers a total of 3,405 married lay people and 946 single men and women , plus 376 pastors , most of them married .
