THE TAX THIEVES OF 1951 III . The Finnegan Story WHEN JAMES P. FINNEGAN took office April 1 , 1944 , as United States Collector of Internal Revenue at St. Louis , he had many friends and few , if any , enemies . His portly figure and round , smiling face were a constant portrayal of cheerfulness . Finnegan , the " Genial Jim , " was a typical politician . Never accused of being brilliant , he realized many years ago that a warm personality and ready handshake could be used as well as brains in getting ahead . He became a police court judge and later was elected prosecuting attorney in St. Louis . When Finnegan was named Collector by President Franklin D. Roosevelt , most of his friends thought " Jimmy " would be satisfied with the political prestige which included having his picture taken with Roosevelt 's successor when his friend Harry Truman visited St. Louis -- -and the local political influence that went with his job . None of his associates imagined that seven years after he took the oath of office the 50-yearold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocked the Internal Revenue Bureau and the DemoJudge George H. Moore in St. Louis with a complaint . Sharp was indignant because some of the tax cases he had handled had not been prosecuted , and to the former agent , it looked as though the " fix " was on . Judge Moore called Attorney General J. Howard McGrath in Washington and discussed a tax inquiry by the federal grand jury in St. Louis . McGrath suggested , instead , that the judge let matters go through " regular channels " in the department . Moore would n't stand for that . He told McGrath : There is a lot of smoke here , and it is a thing that ca n't be smothered up . This is the worst district in the United States to have anything break out because this is the President 's home state , and this is the home city of Secretary of the Treasury John W. Snyder . A major operation is called for . There ought to be surgery to the bone . The grand-jury investigation got under way , after Moore said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shortly afterward , Finnegan confidently predicted that the inquiry would not touch his office since ? ? ? we re in the business of collecting taxes , and we have done a damn good job of it . " It looked as though he were right , because the grand jury , in a partial report prepared with the help of an attorney from McGrath 's office , declared it was unable to uncover evidence of tax irregularities . Judge Moore described the report as unsatisfactory , perhaps , he added ? in an obvious crack at the Justice Department ? because of lack of " sympathetic support and guidance which you should have received from some quarters but failed to get . " In sending the jury back for further deliberation , he charged : " Do n't let anyone , whatever his interest , thwart the effort to have a searching investigation as directed by this court . " Finnegan 's star was setting . Last April 4 , he announced that he would resign , effective in 10 days , to devote full time to a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About two weeks before the Collector announced his resignation , it was later learned , Secretary of the Treasury Snyder telephoned Judge Moore and promised to take action to correct irregularities in Finnegan 's office . Shortly thereafter , Commissioner of Internal Revenue George . J. Schoeneman telephoned the judge with the promise Finnegan would resign . As Finnegan went off to Florida for a vacation , the grand jury again took up its tax inquiry . Except for a blast by Sen. John J. Williams ( R , Del. ) to the effect that the Treasury and Justice Departments were withholding . damaging evidence against Finnegan , there was a lull that proved to be the one before the storm . ? The storm was a series of disclosures about RFC deal ings that centered around Finnegan , Democratic National Chairman William 0 . Boyle and the American Lithofold Corporation of St. Louis . Lithofold , printers of special office forms , tried to get an RFC loan three times , but on each occasion it was turned down . When three Lithofold men called on Boyle , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone call to Harley Hise , RFC chairman . The loan was soon granted . The story of the part played by Finnegan in the Lithofold-RFC manipulations was told in detail at Congressional committee hearings . Finnegan , employed by the St. Louis firm at $1,000 a month ( while he still held the Collector 's job ) , was responsible for getting Cecil A. Green , former Kansas City saloonkeeper , on Lithofold 's payroll as Washington - greeter . " Green was directly responsible for getting Boyle on the payroll . That was in early 1949 . How could Finnegan , employed by Lithofold since late 1948 , collect $45,000 from the company and still earn his salary as Collector of Internal Revenue ? The Senators wanted an answer . Finnegan had it : When I was sworn in as Collector as successor to Robert E. Hannegan a St. Louisan who was later chairman of the Democratic National Committee and then Postmaster Gen-eral , I was told I could give as little or as much time to Hannegan told me I could continue the job as I wanted . with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Finnegan said he became Collector at the suggestion of Hannegan , now dead . One of the Missouri Senators who approved Finnegan 's appointment in 1944 was Harry S. Truman . The portly witness readily acknowledged that he averaged spending only two to four hours a day on his $10,500 job . There were days , he admitted , when he merely checked in by telephone . Besides the $45,000 from Lithofold and his government pay , Finnegan had a substantial iikome from his outside law practice .. His gross receipts from his law practice were . $36,700 in 1947 ; $30,800 in 1948 ; and $37,400 in 1949 . When he revealed he had spent $8,000 to $9,000 in Lithofold 's behalf for entertaining public officials , the Senators wanted to know bow the money was spent . He replied : Oh , political parties , entertainment and things like that , Once I entertained the Governor of Missouri , and I found out later I could n't do it ? the Internal Revenue Bureau disallowed it as a tax deduction . Turning to one of the Senators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party at the Shoreham the Washington hotel where Finnegan engaged suites on his frequent visits to the capital while Collector , and I could spend $800 so fast you would n't know it was gone . " Finnegan did n't always go to the Shoreham , however . The Post-Dispatch disclosed that he , Merl Young and Rex Jacobs met June 18 , 1950 , in Washington 's Mayflower Hotel to discuss plans to acquire the government-owned Nicaro nickel plant in Cuba . Boyle , then chairman of the Democratic National Committee , was in another room in the hotel , and he and Finnegan consulted frequently by telephone , but the deal eventually fell through . On the home front in St. Louis , it appears , Finnegan also was a busy man during the substantial periods he was not in his office at the Federal Building . John Martin Brodsky , a St. Louis insurance broker , told Internal Revenue agents he obtained the names of prospective insurance clients from Finnegan and that these prospects were in tax difficulties . Later , however , Brodsky denied making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five counts ? three for misconduct in office and two for accepting bribes to influence , his decision as Collector ? heard witnesses on the Brodsky matter but returned no charges . It had other material to work with , however . It found that Finnegan , while Collector , received $5,000 for representing the Warwick Hotel Company of St. Louis in its claim against the government for damages to the hotel when it was taken over and occupied by the Coast Guard from 1943 to 1946 . The hotel operators received a substantial settlement . The grand jury said Finnegan , through his influence and position as Collector , obtained information for the Warwick Hotel Company concerning this claim . Another count dealt with the Lithofold Corporation . Finnegan , it was charged , received $3,000 from Litho-fold for acting in its behalf to obtain the RFC loan while he was an officer of the federal government . A third count , based on the allegation that the St. Louisan tried to play both sides of the fence ? being with the government and against it ? relates to Finnegan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a local firm , which was seeking an RFC loan and also was in controversy with the government over the collection and payment of withholding and social-security taxes . Finnegan allegedly had a $641 furniture bill paid by Karol Kell Company for representing it in the RFC application and for instructing employees in his office to go easy in collecting the taxes in dispute . The St. Louisan was charged with receiving two checks , each for $250 , to influence his decision on taxes claimed by the government from the garment firm . Finnegan claimed that he received money from Karol Kell , not in connection with its government dealings , but for other legal advice . Jim Finnegan was a close friend of Harry Truman and of almost all the other Missourians who have risen to top political jobs in Washington in the last decade , but the report is that he is on his own now . For a time , it seems , politics almost saved Finnegan . Judge Moore disclosed recently that the Justice Department interfered in two instances with the grand-jury inquiry . Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " damnable and contemptible lies , " but he later apologized publicly , and to Moore personally , for his statement . Secretary Snyder now says he asked Finnegan to quit eight months before he did , but Finnegan contends he was asked three times by the White House to stay on . At arraignment recently on the indictment , Finnegan pleaded not guilty . No one can say whether he will be found innocent or guilty but one thing is sure : The happy smile seldom is seen these days on the round face of Jim Finnegan .
