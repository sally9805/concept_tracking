When the Soviet army came rolling to the village of Morawice , near Cracow , in World War II , the Russians grandly parceled out the big estates ( formerly owned by Count Potocki and the Duke of Radziwill ) among the local peasants . But before the peasants could quite get used to their happy new condition , the Communist Party workers moved into Morawice , urged that they merge their holdings into Soviet-type collective farms . When the . peasants hesitated , the Communists turned the economic screws , demanded larger deliverfes of corn , milk and potatoes . More in the spirit of Poland 's traditional agricultural " circles " than from socialist leanings , one group of 13 families pooled their 100 acres of land and formed a collective called Victoria . <P> In the beginning , results were good , but then the Communists began to take a bigger share of the farm 's produce . There were interminable , time-consuming party discussions , but little fertilizer , no tractors . Because they had collaborated with the Communists , the farmers of Victoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet pigs , " says Zofia Szczygiel , president of the Victoria collective . <P> Down Tools &; Vodka . In the next six years , Victoria fell into neglect , 15% of the cultivatable land was not used , farmers spent more time on their tiny home plots , and debts accumulated . <P> One day last October the quiet revolution came to Morawice . The people of the village heard newly appointed Party Secretary Wladyslaw Gomulka say on the radio that no more money would be spent subsidizing collectives . Says Zofia Szczygiel : " Everybody out in the fields threw down their tools and went home for a drink of vodka . Then they went and got their tools again and started marking out their claims to private property . " A village committee soon ironed out the boundary disputes , and by the time Gomulka got around to acknowledging the end of forced collectivization , Victoria had ceased to exist . <P> Morawice has become a new village since that day . Neighbors speak to each other again , freely participate in village affairs . Production is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 35 may be seen . Because there are no forced milk deliveries , the farmers are producing as many calves as they can , and every yard of arable land is heavily planted . Said an old peasant : " Today if we waste land , it is money out of our own pockets . " The geese and hogs that waddle across Mora-wice 's bumpy main street are 100% capitalist-owned . <P> My Own Boss . All that remains to remind people of the hated era of collectivization , reported TIME Correspondent Edward Hughes from Morawice last week , is a little signboard in the center of the village square , which . bears faded posters of another government , with pictures of Warsaw 's Russian-built " Palace of Culture . " The new attitude towards the party was summed up by an ancient pitchfork-brandishing farmer : " I 'm my own boss now and when some party man comes out to tell me to go out to rake hay for the nation , I have a big needle for his back end .
