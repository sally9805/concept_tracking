He 'd - " They 're trying to move in again ! " boomed a voice on the pier . " Battle sta-tions ! " Pomeroy braked with his wings and stared in astonishment . Something had happened to the tourists . All these days free from pelican suzerainty had gisen them the will to resist ; they had become bold on the heady stuff of actually keeping , the fish they caught . And every man jack of them was armed with something throwable which he proceeded to hurl at Pomeroy . The young pelican ducked and dodged. but even so he caught plenty .

" He gloomily looked out toward the fishing grounds where the pelicans who dived for a living were dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laughing over little jokes , never thinking of Pomeroy these days . He turned his sad eyes shoreward , toward the pier . Gilly and his gang had moved in and now they cluttered the pilings that had once been reserved for the most elite of pelicans , The Club members . The tourists did not bother them  --  no gull could unhook a fish  --  and the Mooney 's Fish House crowd were doing all right on dead bait , scraps of leftover lunch and other titbits . " My pals , " Pomeroy said bitterly . " Split their sides laughin ' while t was geom. that going-os es . They knew what I was gain ' to get and they let me stick my neck out . And i thought they were my friends , " Friends ? He had no friends . The world was against him .

All it would do would burn up the tourists wherever I went , if I tried that dive-hornbill ' st off , " Burn up the tourists  --  for a moment Pomeroy was tempted to do just that , out of meanness , but he shook his banged-up head ; somehow it seemed a pretty lousy trick , spoiling everything for everybody just because he 'd goofed off completely with his osvn life .

He was alone , an outcast , a pariah. and he was only a little boy . after all . It was awful . The more he thought of it , the worse it got , and pretty soon it became too much for him to hear . He begun to weep , the tears coursing down his cheeks . How long he sat there . weeping , the buoy 's bell tolling a mournful accompaniment , he never knew ; but it seemed forever before a wing was thrown over his shoulder and poppa cleared his throat and said huskily , " There , there , son .

Took off all that excess weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they feel twenty years younger ; would n't go back to The Club if they could . " And that was the way it was when Pomeroy went back to Spindrift Key . Maybe the ex-clubmen were a bit cool at first , but they accepted him eventually and so did all the other pelicans when they saw how Pomeroy had changed . If you 're down that way , you 'll see them all getting along sery buddy-buddy , at Spindrift Key and out on the fishing grounds . And at the latter place , if you look sharp , you might notice that one of the pelicans , when he dives , hits the water tail-first. an agonized expression on his face , one wing tightly clenched over his beaked nose . That 's Pomeroy . He is firmly resolved to do everything he 's supposed to do , even high-dive for fish , but that does n't mean he has to like it . Tile Music Hall tCorainued from Page 35 ) The stage shows are always lavish and often startling . A mighty battleship with turrets turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , which can be made big enough  --  it 's a hundred and forty-four feet long by eighty-four wide  --  to accommodate an ordinary house and tot . Ors transatlantic liner may break in two and seem to sink almost into the laps of the front-row customers . Or the curtain may go up on a circus scene with twenty-three trained horses , a few elephants and a chorus of seventy dancers . Such spectacles , always elaborately beautiful and pleasantly corny , have made the Music Hall one of New York 's top tourist attractions since its doors first opened a quaver of a century ago . But not all the surprises are on the theater program , nor are all the miracles at the Music Hall performed in view of the audience . Take the day that three elephants refused  --  that 's what their trainer said  --  to go on stage unless they first had a bath . The backstage labyrinth at the theater is equipped for almost anything , but nobody had ever thought of trying to bathe an elephant there . John Jackson , director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show runs , took a quick look at the balky elephants and began giving orders . A garden hose was run into the animal dressing room , tubs and scrub brushes were produced , and everybody went to work . Three freshly bathed and contented elephants made their curtain call on time . The stage crew must be able to solve such problems immediately , because a delay or a missing performer can wreck the pace of the whole show . On one occasion a member of a three-man Swiss juggling team was suddenly stricken ill . A look at the schedule showed that the Swiss team was supposed to perform while heavy scenery was shifted for the next act . If the jugglers failed to go on , it would be necessary to lower the curtain and stop the show for eight minutes . Jackson , who had been watching the jugglers every day for a week , could think of only one alternative . Taking a deep breath , he pia on a fancy costume and went out on the stage with the two remaining Swiss to toss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied juggling as a boy vaudeville trouper . He did well too . Some of the unscheduled but best-remembered surprises at the Music Hall have centered around the four big stage elevators , which can lift the musicians or half a hundred dancers or a few tons of scenery from the basement up to stage level  --  or higher if desired . Both of the theater 's stage-show producers  --  Leon LconicrolT and Russell M arkert  --  make extensive use of the elevators to get unusual effects , such as raising the swirling members of the Corps de Ballet high into the air as they finish their dance number . This almost always brings a gasp of delight from the audience . On one unhappy afternoon , however , the elevator apparatus blew a fuse . Instead of raising the dancers above the stage , the elevator lowered them to the basement , where they took their bows before the astonished eyes of engineer William Kells  --  and nobody else . The elevators , which can move at any speed from five to forty-five feet a minute . occasionally upset the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired trombone player turned slightly green as the orchestra pit was raised from the basement into view of the audience . He looked around wildly for an instant , then leaped over the railing of the pit and ran madly up the center aisle to the men 's room . Another time . a Rockette  --  one of the theater 's famous group of precision dancers  --  was following the line along a narrow shelf extending from the stage when she missed her footing and tumbled on top of a violinist in the orchestra pit . The thirty-five other Rockettes closed ranks and went right on kicking at the rate of twenty kicks a minute . The most memorable blooper occurred . however , during a gaudy production in which the orchestra was supposed to he raised by elevator to stage level and then moved to the rear of the stage on art electric-powered device known as the bandwagon , Before the show started , an electrician was installed in a small compartment under the orchestra pit , where he lay prone and operated the controls of the bandwagon , All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestra , as if responding to a flick of conductor Raymond Paige 's baton , rose majestically to stage level  --  where it stopped dead . The whole show stopped dead , too , until in desperation a dozen stage hands crept out behind the orchestra and manually rolled the big bandwagon to the back of the stage . When they opened the operator 's compartment , it was cozily warm inside and the electrician was sound asleep . One of the phenomena of New York show business is the crowd that flocks to the Music Hull during holiday and vacation seasons . At Christmas or Easter time . the first patrons may arrive soon after dawn and stand in line for several hours before the doors open , even on bitterly cold days . Russell V. Downing president and managing director of the theater. recently estimated that more than 90 per cent of Music Hall patrons during peak holiday periods were tourists or out-of-town visitors . At those times as many as 100 chartered buses filled with vacationers or school children may arrive at the theater in a single week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I0,000 persons , or one and a half times the capacity of the theater , were waiting for admittance . Sydney Goldman , director of theater operations , has six assistants and IN ushers and doormen trained to handle large crowds . Most of the staff are local college boys working part-time . The January I I , 19.141 staff is prepared to deal with anything Atom a request for directions to a good , modenitety priced restaurant to complaints that the theater is too hot or too cold . The Music Ilan air-conditioning equipment Pumps air at the rate of forty cubic feet a minute for each patron thmugh apertures in the ceiling . Engineers check the temperature and humidity six times a day , and each assistant manager carries a pocket thermometer to show unhappy customers that they arc really comfortable after all . t he Music Hall is so large and there are so many aisles and so many rows of seats that it is easy to get lost . Youngsters who think they are old enough to tind their way to one or the nine rest rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mother is another matter . Ushers are accustomed to rescuing weeping children , using a bit of psychology to stem their tears and then tedding them up and down the aisles until an anxious mother comes to the rescue , There have been instances , of course , when some mothers have got so absorbed in the show that they did n't miss their children until the youngsters were led down the aisle , wailing loudly . - But the really persistent offenders are the grandmothers , " Goldman said recently . " They lose more children than all the others put together and often get lost themselves . " Gloves , glasses and earrings are the articles most frequently lost in the theater , but the cleaners find between six and ten wallets each week , and on two occasions pistols were picked up after the late show . In both instances , the owners had licenses to carry arms . Now and then a woman 's shoe is found , apparently kicked several rows away from its owner and given up as lost . Curiously , the staff has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe . Once a cleaner rescued a book entitled How to Improve Your Memory , Goldman 's staff takes all this in its stride and the first-aid nurses who are always on duty have even handled a couple of cases in which expectant mothers were bundled into ambulances and taken to a hospital just in time . Among the Music Hall patrons  --  there were once 186,000 in a single week  --  arc a few " regulars . " One slight , white-haired amateur photographer , James Valentino. has been in his front-row scat several times a week for the last half dozen years and recalls that he saw one show , The Great Caruso , no fewer than thirty times during its ten-week run . Valentino has a collection of about 500 color pictures he has taken of the Rockettes in action . Another regular was a sweet-faced old lady who was always rather shabbily dressed in the high-necked , long-skirted costumes anti high-button shoes of the gay nineties . She was always first in line for the opening of new shows and in time became two:tinted with members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reilly . One day she told Reilly that she was curious about what went on backstage , and he arranged for her to attend an early-morning dress rehearsal . During rest periods , the ballet dancers sat near her in the front of the theater , and one of them , Rosalie Spatcher , explained what was going on . This proved so exciting that she came hack to many other rehearsals and always chatted with Miss Spatcher and Reilly . Then one day she failed to appear . Some time later a lawyer came around with news that she had died and that in her will she had divided her estate of 5409.000 between Miss Spatcher and Reilly . The case of the shabby old lady , Mrs. Edna M. A. Elliot . is one that Goldman frequently cites when he emphasizes to his staff the importance of courtesy and helpfulness to patrons . The Music Hall was built with the idea of making it a kind of super-theater . Everything about it was and still is described in superlatives . Its 6200 seats provided the greatest capacity of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the largest in the world . Its organ had pipes thirty-two feet tall and so many mechanical attach . ments that it could imitate anything from a tambourine to a glockenspiel . Its famous contour curtain , which weighs three tons and can be moved into almost any imaginable position by thirteen motors , was the biggest ever constructed . And its opening performance on December 27 , 1932 , was described almost unanimously by critics and patrons as the biggest bore on Broadway . The opening show was " conceived and supervised " by director general S. L. Rothafcl , better known in show-business circles as Roxy . Rosy put together sixteen numbers  --  there was no movie  --  that included the Wallendas , famous European aerialists ; the Tuskegee Choir ; dancer Ray Bolger ; Martha Graham 's dance group ; the vaudeville team of Weber and Fields : and , on Sunday . the First Popular Symphony Concert , with Leopold Stokowski as guest conductor . It was an incredible collection of talent and it was a resounding flop , perhaps because there was just too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stage show was cut to fifty minutes and a motion picture was added , inaugurating a policy that has continued ever since . Business picked up a little , but by 1933 the Music Hall was one of the outstanding financial failures in show business . That autumn the management was reorganized by its owners , Rockefeller Center , Inc , . and in the next decade the theater made a slow climb upward . In 1946 , it set a world 's attendance record of 7,108,001 and in 1956 it grossed about 57,500,18X ) under the direction of Downing , who originally joined the organization in 1933 as treasurer , Today the Music Hall has a permanent staff of approximately 600 persons , a weekly payroll of $50,000 and a reputation that lures tourists from all parts of the country . This reputation rests on a direct " family appeal " to the popular taste of Americans of all ages and a remarkable ability to produce a lavish new stage show approximately once every month . Downing and his advisers more or less have the pick of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , it is difficult to select a dozen films a year that will not only draw youngsters in droves to the matinees but will appeal to enough older persons to fill the theater each evening . The stage shows are primarily the responsibility of three men with wide experience in the entertainment field  --  Russell Marken , producer and director of the Rockettes ; Leon Leonidoff , senior producer ; and Raymond Paige. director of music . Marker : grew up in the Florenz Ziegfeld tradition and tends toward elaborate show-girl productions . Leonidoff , born In Rumania and a former dancer , emphasizes ballet and surprising -transformations , " or changes of scenery , before the eyes of the audience . Each stage show must have something for everybody  --  the suburban clubwoman who adores symphonic music , the small boy who gazes wide-eyed at performing bears , the men who like to look at a high-kicking chorus line , Still more important , the show must be as lavish and as elegant in its own way as any musical extravaganza in town , but it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraction of the time usually required to put a musical on Broadway . This is only slightly less impossible than it may seem at first glance . Abig musical may cost several hundred thousand dollars and may be " on the road " for several weeks before opening on Broadway . A Music Hall production , on the other hand , is limited to a scant two hours of dress rehearsal before its first performance . That the productions come out so well is due to the skill of Leonidoff . Markert and Paige . Among them they co-ordinate the efforts of a permanent staff of stage designers , dressmakers , hatmakers , artists , carpenters and performers , including the symphony orchestra of fifty pieces , the forty-six Rockettes. the forty members of the Corps de Ballet and the twenty-five members of the Glee Club . Normally three different shows are in the works at the same time  --  one being performed four times daily for an audience , another in rehearsal and a third in the planning stage . if Leonidoff , for instance , is to produce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in September to outline the theme to such staff members as Paige , Markert and his Rockette assistant , Emilia Sherman ; Margaret Sande , director of the ballet ; James Stewart Morcorn , art director ; and Frank Spencer , costume designer . The Music Hall is able to produce big shows at low expense because it has a huge warehouse crammed with scenery , stage properties and fantastic mechanical devices , By refurbishing and tet-onst Filet-Mkt INN equipment and using it at intervals over several years , Morcom can produce a bright new background for almost anything from a display of electric fireworks to an April shower of real raindrops bouncing off a spatterboard high above the stage . In setting the Music Hall stage , both 7. , orcom and Spencer have problems that are unusual in ell for Broadway . The stage is almost a city block aide alien the cast is spread along runways at the sides . In such a large space everything has to be Bs ice as big and twice as bright as normal , or the effect on the audience will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spencer sometimes makes wigs for the dancers out of such things as shirred satin and sequins to get the effect of brightly colored hair on the vast stage . One of the more unusual scenes on which Morcom and Spencer have worked was a ballet at the bottom of the sea . In order to get an underwater effect . Leonidoff proposed the use of ultraviolet lights on a darkened stage to fluoresce the special paint on costumes worn by dancers and sea creatures . The idea seemed good until it was tried out . When the ultraviolet lights were turned on . the painted costumes showed up brilliantly  --  but the unpainted heads , arms and legs of rite dancers disappeared in the gloom , leaving a stage eerily occupied by fifty floating , twirling dresses . The problem esentually was solved by making wigs , gloves , stockings and masks that also would glow under ultraviolet lighting . Another presentation that gave Spencer trouble was a Glory of Easter show which called for the ballet dancers to appear in one scene as nuns and as woolly lambs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few seconds because the dancers wore the lamb costumes underneath the sober robes of the nuns . But at dress rehearsal , an hour before the show opened , Spencer made a horrible discovery . As the nuns walked sedately down a short flight of stairs , every one of them showed two small cloven hoofs under the long skirts of her robe . Producer Leonidoti shouted the rehearsal to a stop . Miss Sande screamed in dismay . Spencer clutched his head in his hands and engaged in furious thought . There was no time to change the order of scenes or to make new costumes . But Spencer did have time to send out to the nearest department store for thirty-six pairs of those little socks women wear in their shoes when going bare-legged . The dancers put these on over their hoofs for the first scene and then kicked them off backstage before appearing as woolly lambs , and the situation was saved . Doubtless the costume department could have devised some other solution if it had been necessary . It has met some man-sized emergencies over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a last-minute switch in programs , the theater 's hat and costume makers were given two days in which to make 300 complete outfits for forty bullet dancers and forty-six Rockettes . The job was finished in time for the opening . While the costumes and scenery for a new show arc being prepared , the dance routines are worked out by the directors of the ballet corps and the Rockettes . About a week before the opening they and the Gice Club . directed by Ralph Hunter , begin rehearsals in separate backstage halls . Rehearsals are limited , by union regulations , to fifteen hours in all and are usually held in the mornings . The Rockettes  --  there arc forty-six of them , counting spares , but only thirty-six can get on the stage conveniently at one tune  --  are perhaps the best-known precision dancers in die world . They were organi/ed in 14125 by Marken as the Missouri Rockets . Vater they became a hit in New York as the Roityettes at the Roxy Theater and , due to legal complications , had to change their name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the Rockettes come from small towns in various parts of the United States , but this year there were two English girls in the line too . Marken receives letters almost every day from young girls who want advice on how to train , so that they can become Rockettes when they finish high school . Some of these aspirants  --  Jeannette Dix , of Hall-wood , Virginia , in the present group , for example  --  eventually join the group . A Rockette 's career usually ends in marriage after two or three years , but sonic continue as long as ten years : at present there is one member , married to a musician , who has two children . The basic idea of the troupe is that all do exactly the same thing at exactly the same time , so that none stands out from the rest and none becomes known as an individual star . In fact , a " captain " is always watching from the audience at each performance not only to catch any mistakes but to prepare a reprimand for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicking a half inch higher than the others . The Rockettes are so famous for their unison dancing that once when the lead girl went on stage too soon and threw the line into chaos , the audience I II refused to believe it was a mistake and loudly applauded the " comedy " dance routine . The orchestra requires only a few rehearsals for each show , Music director Paige , who formerly headed one of the best-known orchestras on radio , puts a lot of showmanship into conducting . shakes his list at the kettledrums , coaxes the violins tenderly and sweats through his sport shirt before work is well started in the stuffy rehearsal hall , Ile and his three assistant conductors have what may be the most trying jobs at the Music Hall . because musicians and singers often are widely scattered around the big stage and unusual skill is required to keep the drummers over near 50th Street in time with harpists or a soloist way over at 51st Street , The tempo of activity in the theater picks up rapidly on Monday , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work is done in staff meetings . Actually , it is not until the last stage show ends at ten o'clock Wednesday evening and the movie is shown for the final time that the real work begins . Behind the big motion-picture screen the stage crew removes the scenery used in the old show and brings on the new properties . By about midnight , the audience is out of the theater , and Leonidoff has just ten hours in which to " go on the road " with the new show in an effort to smooth out the rough spots before the Thursday-morning opening . " On the road " at the Music Hall means that virtually everybody works all night , // sticking rigidly to a minute-by-minute schedule . Leonidoff usually arrives at the theater soon after two A.M. , by which time Morcom and Patrick Douris , the head property man , have finished hanging the new scenery . At four A.M. , Leonidoff perches himself behind a temporary control board set up about twenty rows back in the orchestra seals and starts the scenery rehearsal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stage crew runs through the various changes of scenery , the stage director Jackson notes on his schedule the number of seconds required for each shift . At five A.M. , Leonidoff and Eugene Braun , director of lighting , begin setting up a timetable for the lights , which are controlled from a fifteen-foot-long console that is located just in front of the orchestra pit , but is camouflaged from the view of the audience . There are 15,000 lights in the Music Hall and almost all of them are connected to the console . Although the console has more than 4000 switches , only one man is needed to operate it . By setting a series of thermionic controls in ad- , vance , he can handle all but a few of the lights needed for an entire show . To get color changes on an ordinary spotlight it is necessary for an attendant to change the colored slides manually . On the console , which was built especially for the Music Hall , the operator can achieve color changes on thirty-six big spotlights by setting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are moved back and forth by small motors . Then , when a single master switch is tucked the console will automatically make a carefully timed series of switches from white to red to blue to green , and back again to white . By the time the task of " lighting the show " is completed . about eighty microphones have been shifted into position under direction of Warren Jenkins , head of the sound department . Thirty of these microphones are in the orchestra pit . If the string section of the orchestra is being drowned out during a performance , a sound operator on duty in the back of the theater can boost the volume on ten violins to make them sound like twenty by the time the music is projected into the auditorium through forty-seven loudspeakers around the proscenium arch . By about seven a.m. , Leonidoff has exhausted much more than half of the ten hours allotted him for polishing the new show . By that time , too , a great many more persons  --  musicians , dancers , performers , Florence Anderson , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff members  --  are arriving at the theater for the only full rehearsal of the production . Warnings go out over the public-address system to all backstage dressing rooms , the cafeteria , the flies high above stage and the subbasements : " Five minutes to curtain . " Musicians climb into the orchestra-pit elevator at the second basement level . 1 Dancers drift into the wings , resplendent in new costumes . There is a momentary pause , a kind of lull in which everyone takes a deep breath before the final , frantic two hours in which the new show must be put together for the first time , polished and perfected . Backstage , John Jackson looks at his stopwatch and signals the central control board . The curtain rises , The music breaks the silence of the empty theater . The dancers move out . " Now ! Now ! " Leonidoff barks from the gloomy shadows of the orchestra seats . " Give me the blue lights ! The blue lights ! " The Music Hall show is " on the road . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
