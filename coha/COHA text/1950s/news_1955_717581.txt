txt There seems reasonable likelihood that the cost of living in the United States will move upward slightly in 1956 after remaining stationary for four years . The plateau on which consumer prices have remained anchored since 1951 is one of the most remarkable in history . For most of the nation overall living costs have stayed still while income has increased . This has given the United States an interval of ascending and unparalleled prosperity . The purchasing power of today 's dollar is just about half what it was before World War II . War Brought Inflation To be exact , average consumer prices in 1939 equaled 59.4. based on a scale in which " 100 " equaled the average costs of 1947 to 1949 , while today they are 114.9 . Inflation came rapidly after World War II when government controls were dropped and competition for scarce goods sent prices up . In 1947 , the index had risen to 95.5 and a year later to 102.8 . There seemed some chance that prices would level out at this point and the figure was 101.8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then came the Korean war . This brought scarce goods , scare buying , and government defense purchases . The living cost bounced upward again to 111 for 1951 . For 1952 , the average was 113.5 . From then on there has been stability . From the final year of the Truman administration to the present living costs have been remarkably level . This has benefited tens of millions . Holders of insurance knew what their policies were worth . Annuities and pensions held their value . The figures for the four years : 1952 113.5 1953 114.4 1954 114 . P 1955 ( est ) 114.6 These figures look solid as a rock . The difficulty with them is , however , that the stability is not that of a rock , but of a man carefully balancing a pole on a tightrope . Cost of food products has been going down , that of other items going up  --  producing a balance , but one that is economically precarious . " Reduced prices for food , " observes the latest ( December ) monthly report of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterbalanced by increased prices for several other major categories of goods and services . " Here is the story in figures : In 1952 , the index figure for " food " stood at 114.6 but it has now dropped to 110.8 . In contrast , the figure for " rent " has jumped from 117.9 to 130.8 in the same period . Consumers were benefited by the decline of prices at the grocery but balanced it off by higher prices , like rent , in other fields . Middlemen Gain A concealed inflation has been going on , masked by the sinking farm prices . Only part of the lower farm prices has been handed on to the consumer at the retail level . Much or most of it has been absorbed by processors or middlemen . Take milk . The housewife paid 22 cents a quart in 1948 and pays 24 cents today , but the price received by the farmer has dropped : He got 10.6 cents for raw milk in 1948 and gets only 9.6 cents today . Over-all prices received by the farmer in 1952 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lye gets . La . The interpretation of these figures seems to be that price stability in the United States is built to a substantial degree on the misfortune of the farmers . The farmers ' parity ratio ( percentage ratio of index of prices received by farmers to prices paid by farmers , interest , taxes , and wage rates ) stood at 100 in the last year of the Truman ad , ministration . Now it is down to 81 having dropped another point I ' lin the past month . Reserve Sets Brakes What has been a level stretch for the rest of the nation has been a toboggan for the farms . Some economists now think it will be difficult to maintain this equilibrium of opposites through 1956 . The index of industrial prices has been rising for the four years . It was 113.2 in 1952 and has advanced to 119.3 for the week ended Dec. 6 , the highest on record . If living costs advance next year they should be small and relatively unimportant . The federal reserve system has doggedly set the brakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand . the competition for new goods is so great that some industries are running into bottlenecks of supply , particularly metals . Much will depend on whether the next session of Congress keeps the lid on , or takes inflationary action .
