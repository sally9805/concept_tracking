A startling new treatment for schizophrenia marked by delusions of persecution ( one of the most difficult forms of the disease ) was reported to Zurich by Dr. D. Ewen Cameron , director of Montreal 's Allan Memorial Institute . Key to the treatment : " complete depatterning " of the patient 's mind through shock therapy and deep sleep . Unlike brainwashing , Psychiatrist Cameron 's method does not seek to implant alien ideas in the mind , but rather to break the chain of schizophrenic reactions and leave the mind free to reorganize itself . Granting that the method is " a sharp tool , " Cameron considers it justified for the most stubborn cases , declares this controversial technique has proved " more successful than any previously reported . " <P> The Experiment . In Cameron 's experiment , each of 26 patients aged 17 to 54 ( five men , 21 women ) was dosed with chlorpromazine , which increased the sedative effect of barbiturates . By the end of the first week they were sleeping 20 to 22 hours a day . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to semisolid . They got five units of insulin half an hour before each meal . With the onset of deep sleep , patients were wakened three times a day for meals and toileting . By the tenth day they were put on intensive electroshock treatment-usually one treatment daily , and often receiving four or five shocks in two to three minutes-far more intensive than previously tried shock treatments . Said Dr. Cameron : " The rate is set so that complete depatterning is achieved between the 13th and 16th days , after about 30 shock treatments . Complete depatterning is maintained five to seven days . " <P> At first the patient knows why he is in the hospital , recognizes individuals . In the second stage he loses his sense of space and time , but is conscious of the loss and worries about it . In the third stage , depatterning , he no longer bothers about the lack of space-time sense and is contented just as he is . He recognizes nobody and does not care . <P> The Results . When they are satisfied that depatterning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbiturates gradually and cut the shock treatments to three a week . During a month of rehabilitation , a nurse or attendant helps the patient to reorient himself . After discharge there is intensive follow-up through doctors and social workers . By way of " maintenance treatment , " the patient goes back to the hospital every week for shock therapy during the first month , and once a month for the next two years . <P> Results of Cameron 's experiment : of ten patients previously ill less than two years , all have been discharged , and none has had to be readmitted , though a few have had additional shock treatments as outpatients . Of 16 ill longer than two years , all but three have gone home ( though two others had to be readmitted ) . Most have gone back to work or keeping house : some have even married and had children-getting shock treatments regularly during pregnancy .
