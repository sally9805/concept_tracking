WE ASKED FOR EVIDENCE ! cried the London Daily Herald . THERE IS NOT A SHRED OF IT IN THE WHITE PAPER . With varying degrees of indignation , all but two of London 's newspapers agreed : the Tory government 's White Paper , explaining the wave of arrests in the Central African Federation , spoke of " trends toward violence " in Nyasaland but never once offered any proof of the much-touted " R day " white massacre that had triggered all the uproar , the 50-odd African deaths and the 500 arrests ( TIME , March 30 ) . The Colonial Office limply tried to explain that " we could not jeopardize our sources , " presumably paid African informers . Faced with the outcry , Colonial Secretary Alan Lennox-Boyd appointed a commission to investigate the situation , headed by High Court Justice Sir Patrick Devlin , 53 , who ably presided over the famed murder trial of Dr. John Bodkin Adams ( TIME , Jan. 28 , 1957 et seq . ) . <P> Only 48 Years . The naming of the commission mollified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lords was treated to a speech that nearly unsettled everything again . Up popped 75-year-old Lord Malvern , who as Sir Godfrey Huggins was the first Prime Minister of the Central African Federation when Nyasaland and the two Rhodesias were linked together in 1953 . His credentials to discuss Central Africa were that " I have only lived there 48 years , " and that he knows more about the subject than " itinerant politicians " who , he said , prowl about Africa , writing for left-wing newspapers and stirring up the natives . Visiting M.P.s such as Laborite John Stonehouse ( " really quite harmless , except that he was extremely ignorant " ) had been completely taken in by the Africans , who " until they are very much advanced are all liars . " When the hubbub in the House subsided , His Lordship went on to talk about the " burden , at any rate , the mission of looking after Nyasaland . I should like to say that the people in the Federation have not the slightest intention of surrendering Nyasaland to destruction by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of thing to endear the get-tough policies of Malvern 's successor , federal Prime Minister Sir Roy Welensky , to his London critics . No African , said the Earl of Lucan , could now " have any doubt as to the kind of attitude of certain of the Europeans . " But last week , in the Rhodesias themselves , just when matters seemed to be getting out of hand , calmer views began to prevail . Southern Rhodesia 's Prime Minister Sir Edgar Whitehead , faced with strong criticism by clergymen and lawyers , withdrew his police-state Preventive Detention Act and set free about 50 Africans held without charge . <P> First in the South . In Northern Rhodesia , late election results showed that Welensky 's United Federal Party finished out front but failed to win a clear majority . Four out of 20 seats on the legislative council went to the new Central African Party , headed by Garfield Todd , whose liberal racial views cost him the Southern Rhodesian premiership in 1958 . <P> And as if eager to show that he too was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savanhu as parliamentary secretary of the federal Minister of Home Affairs , the first black in all of Southern Africa to achieve so high a government post .
