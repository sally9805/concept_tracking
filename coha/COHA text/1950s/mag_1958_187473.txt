The liberal Protestant Christian Century headed its editorial page last week with a blast from the Rev. Charles Duell Kean of Washington 's Episcopal Church of the Epiphany against the U.S. Navy for attaching a St. Christopher medal to its successful Vanguard satellite-bearing rocket . " Would it have served just as well . " demanded Dr. Kean , " if along with the countdown routine , a man had been assigned at each stage in the process to cross his fingers and say ' Muggles ' ? Had anyone thought of attaching a four-leaf clover to the missile somewhere ? The fact that a symbol or a word is associated with traditional Christianity does not prevent its being used in the most blatantly superstitious manner possible . The fact that there are religious and moral ideals in our Western heritage does not prevent these symbols from being caricatured , so that not only is the symbol itself made ridiculous but the faith behind it is turned into children 's triviality . " <P> Pope Pius XII told delegates of the 13th Congress of the International Association of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probe the mind are " open to reservations , " however praiseworthy the ends . Some secrets , he said , " can absolutely not be unveiled , even to one prudent person . " The Pope also condemned the use of lie detectors . Explained a Vatican official : " The lie detector is always illicit , even with the consent of the subject . Just as a man may not consent to euthanasia because religious law forbids him from doing away with himself , so he may not destroy his own freedom to answer or not according to his own judgment . Those who ask for a lie-detector test in order to prove they are speaking the truth must find other means of convincing inquirers . Otherwise , the point will come when anyone who refuses a lie-detector test will automatically feel accused of falsehood . A true reply must be freely spoken-not spoken under the pressure of certainty that untruths will out .

" The more we understand of our procreative powers , " said the report , " the more responsible we are for the way in which we use them . If our conscience will not tolerate , when we know how to prevent it , a torrent of infant deaths , no more should we , with the knowledge we have , encourage an ungoverned spate of unwanted births .
