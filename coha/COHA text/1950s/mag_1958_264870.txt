That popular Eastern melodrama . Here Come the Generals , which has played so successfully during recent weeks in Pakistan , Burma , Thailand and Iraq , opened to thunderous applause last week in Khartoum , capital of the Sudan . <P> There were scarcely any changes in the script : the curtain rose on a sleeping city , a soft wind stirred the camel-foot trees along the Nile . At midnight armored cars , Bren gun carriers , lorries packed with troops rolled out from the suburban barracks and into Khartoum and its sister cities of Omdurman and Khartoum North . One unit occupied the radio station ; another took over the telephone exchange . Troops in pompon hats and khaki shorts were dropped off in front of the houses of prominent politicians . At 5 a.m. the officeholders were rudely awakened , handed letters firing them from their jobs . <P> Identical Words . The radio had come on the air , blaring martial music . Then at dawn the announcer read a communique signed by Lieut . General Ibrahim Abboud , chief of staff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000,000 square miles of the Sudan , said Abboud , to end governmental corruption and chaos and to restore peace and order . Declaring martial law , Abboud shut down all newspapers , banned all political parties and public assemblies or demonstrations . Using almost the identical words of General Ne Win and General Ayub Khan when they seized power in Burma and Pakistan , General Abboud insisted : " I am not a politician . I have been busy with military matters and have n't studied these things . " <P> But someone had clearly been doing political homework . Most of the evidence pointed to ousted Premier Abdullah Khalil . Strongly anti-Nasser , Khalil had been having difficulties . Bedeviled by rising prices , by an economic boycott on the part of Egypt and a growing surplus of <P> Sudanese cotton , faced with dissidents in his own Cabinet , Khalil could see governmental control slipping to his pro-Nasser rival , Ismail el Azhari , who recently predicted for Khalil " the fate of Nuri as-Said , " the murdered Premier of Iraq . The fate of Nuri is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got set for his coup while Ismail was conferring in Cairo with Nasser . Khalil could depend on the army , since he personally conducted a purge in 1956. when every officer was " scrutinized for his political views . " More important . Abboud 's second-in-command . Major General Ahmed Abdel Wahab , is a close friend and relative of Khalil . <P> Short , stocky Ibrahim Abboud , 58 , is known to his fellow officers as a fatherly type . Born on the Red Sea coast , a member of the Hadendowa tribe that furnished the Fuzzy-Wuzzies immortalized by Rudyard Kipling for breaking a British square , Abboud became an army lieutenant in 1921 , served with the British in Eritrea and North Africa during World War II , emerged as a colonel commanding a camel corps , and was finally named chief of staff by Premier Khalil . <P>
