Corporal Robert Davis , a big , serious-faced Negro BAR man from the 24th Infantry Regiment , and his buddy , Jimmy Wright , spent most of last week in a foxhole on a hilltop near Masan . They did n't remember all of what had happened to them , but they did remember some things . Davis told TIME Correspondent Jim Bell about them . <P> " My buddy and I seen this snake wrigglin ' into the hole ; it was a little green snake , and they 'd tole us it was real poisonous . We could n't get out of the hole . They woulda got us for sure . So Jimmy he reaches over real careful and grabs the snake by the neck and he squeezes him until he is dead and then we start shootin ' at the gooks again . " <P> Bob Davis and Jimmy Wright had been told where to dig their foxhole , and where and when to fire their weapons . Their task was to protect a supply road between Masan and Chindong . Their captain had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , on the road 's right flank . They stayed there a long time . <P> One night the Reds attacked steadily from dusk until dawn . " They do n't make sense , " said Davis . " We kill ' em and kill ' em and they still keep coming . We captured one that night and he was drunk . They must all be drunk . " <P> The next order Davis and Wright received from their captain was to come back down from the hilltop foxhole . It was a steep hill . Earlier , 30 men had taken seven hours to get two wounded G.I.s down to the road . Bob Davis and Jimmy Wright made it in 45 minutes . <P> When they reached the floor of the valley , they stopped to eat their breakfast rations . Almost instantly they were under heavy mortar and machine-gun fire . An MP sergeant driving a jeep along the road was hit in the back ; his vehicle careened off the road into a bank . Davis and Wright dashed across a green paddy field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fire , they looked up at the crag they had just left ; it was now occupied by a Communist machine-gun crew . <P> Davis and Wright watched while other Red units began lobbing white phosphorus shells along the road and lacing it with heavy automatic fire . Then three U.S. tanks rumbled down the road and began blasting away at the same crag lately tenanted by Bob Davis , Jimmy Wright and the green snake . <P> A lieutenant came up to Davis and Wright and told them they were going to have to go up the hill again . Said Davis : " We did n't ask him why , because we never know about those things . " Davis and Wright fought their way back up the hill ; it was straight up . They reached the top after dark and settled in their old hole . This time , they said , they found no green snake .
