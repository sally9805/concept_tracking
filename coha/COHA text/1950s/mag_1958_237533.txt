Attorney Frank Fowles , 66 , is one of Utah 's leading citizens . He owns a prosperous Ogden insurance business , has served 20 years in the state senate , is a potential candidate for Governor or Congress . These blessings are minor compared to the latest event in Fowles 's life . Early this month his doctors revealed that Fowles had become one of medicine 's real rarities-a case of spontaneous cancer regression . <P> The Operation . A sturdy , calm , active man , Fowles began to feel sick in November 1955 . Symptoms : chest pains , short breath , chills and fever . His doctors diagnosed gallstones . Surgeons removed the stones at an Ogden hospital-but also found a spreading cancer in the liver . A postoperative tissue study confirmed the fact ; Fowles had metastases throughout his liver and bile ducts from a primary malignancy of the pancreas . Patient Fowles was given no more than 90 days to live . His wife and four children were informed ; he was told only that his gallstones had been successfully removed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The 90 days passed . " I thought there was something wrong with my wife , " he recalls . " She seemed to be going to pieces , and I had no idea why . " <P> Fowles did have one complaint : discomfort from a plastic tube leading out from his liver through an opening in the abdominal wall . His surgeon had installed it as a substitute bile duct during the operation , believing that continued cancer growth would require it . Fowles angrily agitated for its removal . Some 18 months after his first operation , the doctors agreed to " correct " the tube with surgery-and found all signs of cancer gone . " There was n't a trace , " they say . " We looked everywhere . " Fifteen months later , there is still no evidence of cancer . <P> The Phenomenon . Since 1900 there have been only 120 proven cases of such spontaneous regression . Leading regressive cancers : neuroblastoma , a malignancy of the sympathetic nervous system that turns up chiefly in young children , and chorionepithelioma , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regression has been recorded only once in carcinoma of the liver , once in carcinoma of the pancreas . <P> The phenomenon is still a complete mystery . According to Surgeons Tilden C. Everson and Warren H. Cole , who have long studied it at the University of Illinois College of Medicine , there is no single cause , but there are likely combinations of causes . Some people may be able to develop antibodies against a possible cancer virus ; others may have hormonal changes that are just right for killing cancer . Nutrition of cancer may also be reduced or regression may follow fever or acute infection . Such possibilities are all remote ; but the fact that the body sometimes knows how to kill cancer may some day show the way to man .
