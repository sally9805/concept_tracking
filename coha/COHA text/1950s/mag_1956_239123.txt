The Good Man <P> Sir : <P> There have always been exemplary lives , like Mr John D. **25;17342;TOOLONG portrayed in TIME Sept. 24-which show to what heights of ethical and spiritual perfection man is capable of ascending . <P> <P> ENRIQUE AVILA <P> San Diego <P> Your story on Rockefeller read like the officially approved biographies of Henry Ford and Mary Baker Eddy . TIME used to be an organ of sharp , witty criticism rather than a cliche-ridden apologist for a spiked version of the American Dream . <P> <P> JOHN R. TOWNSEND <P> Minneapolis <P> Sir : <P> Let us suppose that you were the victim or a holdup man , and later on , his son , who accepted the loot , knowing exactly how it was obtained , tossed you a handful of coins . Would you call that charity and would you respect the donor ? <P> <P> G. DEWEY SPIES San Mateo , Calif . <P> <P> His character is a tribute to devoted and devout parents . His life is an example and an inspiration to the world . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> You say the Rockefellers read the Bible every morning . I wonder what thought ran through their minds when they came to St. Matthew " Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth " ( 6:19 ) . Did this passage create the guilty feelings that resulted the philanthropy ? <P> <P> PETER A. KAROPOULOS <P> Somerville , Mass . <P> <P> Sir : <P> TIME 'S sentimental , sweet story about superhuman , superpious Rockefeller showed extremely bad taste . I never read a similar accumulation of platitudes . It was doubtless the worst piece of writing I ever read in your magazine . <P> HANS RUTHENBERG Ames , Iowa <P> Sir : <P> The only people who can not look upon the life of John D. Rockefeller Jr . as a composite of kindness , greatness and unselfish devotion to mankind everywhere are those who are unwilling to recognize that some men will always have more than others . <P> <P> JOHN L. COPPIE JR . <P> <P> Pittsburgh <P> How 's Adlai ? <P> <P> Sir : <P> Prior to a boxing match , both fighters are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health question such an important issue of the current presidential campaign , why should n't both presidential candidates give the public a report on their physical condition ? It is entirely possible that Adlai is suffering from a hangnail or fallen arches , unknown to the public . Just how healthy is Adlai anyhow ? I , for one , would like to know . <P> <P> WILLIAM J. GLASER <P> Faribault , Minn . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Am reminded by Stevenson 's speeches of the oldtime patent medicine man who used to drive into a town , gather a crowd , and after softening them up with a funny story and a few wisecracks would harangue the crowd with spellbinding oratory that so magnified every itch , twitch and minor pain inherent in every human being that half his listeners thought they had incipient cancer , tuberculosis or at least a chronic ulcer . Stevenson 's speeches are filled with the same wisecracks , half-truths , distortions and exaggerations designed to scare the susceptible into believing that the Democratic Magic Elixir is their only hope . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
