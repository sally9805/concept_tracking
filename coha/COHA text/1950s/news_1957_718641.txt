txt WASHINGTON , March 10 ? Cairo 's rejection of a plan backed by the United States for provisional operation of the Suez Canal opens a period of delicate maneuvering in United States policy toward Egypt . The Egyptians have indicate to the State Department that they would insist that all canal tolls be paid to them . They would be willing to put half aside in a special account until a final settlement , but would not allow this portion of the tolls to be collected and held by an international agency such as the International Bank for Recon-. struction : - and Development . State Department officials said today that they had expected such a . plan to be the Egyptian counter-offer to a proposal made through the United Nations . The proposal , made by the United States , Britain , France and Norway as principal canal users , was that half the tolls be deposited with an international agency . Barring of Israelis Implied Lieut . Col. Abdel Kader Hatern , director of the Egyptian Information ' Department , who announced yesterday that Egypt had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt would ; in. future as in the past , bar Israeli ships from the Suez Canal and the Gulf ' of Aqaba .. . - ? Some officials saw a bargaining counterpart to this implied position in hints dropped in Cairo and Washington . These hints were to the effect that Egypt would be willing to submit to a decision of the International Court of Justice at The Hague on the question of Israeli rights to passage through the canal and gulf . It appeared that Cairo was preparing for intensive trading on the outstanding issues following the Israeli withdrawal from the Gulf of Aqaba area // and the Gaza Strip . These issues are as follows : What shall be the Suez Canal regime following the failure of Britain and France to solve the problem in their own way ? To what extent can Egypt , now in physical command of the canal , be induced to dilute her 100 per cent control ? 9Is Egypt , having signed the Arab-Israeli Armistice Agreement of 1949 , entitled to exercise belligerent rights ? This is the basic juridical issue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt has the right to prevent Israeli ships from using the Suez Canal ' or the territorial waters of the Strait of Tiran , which leads to the Gulf of Aqaba . The Israelis maintain that also involved is I the question whether Egypt has the right to return to the Gaza 1Strip under the armistice . A belligerent Egypt , they say , sacrifices that right . ( How long should and can the United Nations forces occupy Sharm el Sheikh , overlooking the Strait of Tiran , and the Gaza Strip ? What should the United Nations General Assembly do when and if Cairo asks that Egyptian troops reoccupy these places ? ( Mill the United States unfreeze Egypt 's assets , worth $40,000,000 , and resume the aid program in Egypt ? Will Egypt get a slice Of the $200,000,000 in aid to the Middle East under the Eisenhower Doctrine of helping the area to ward off Communist aggression ?

Saudi Arabia , in the opinion of some , is drifting away . The question of rights to passage through the Gulf of Aqaba to the Israeli port of ? Elath will not arise so long as the United Nations forces remain at the Strait of Tiran . But Israel is expected soon to force the issue of passage in the Suez Canal by trying to send a ship through . The Israelis maintain that this issue is not suitable for World Court litigation because Egypt does not recognize Israel . Some Egyptians contend that the only proper way to get the issue to court would be for Israel to bring up the ' case after Egypt had stopped one of her ships . The United States Government 's position is that if Egypt believes she is z , entitled to halt Israeli shipping she should bring the question to court , and meanwhile give the Israelis passage .. A possible alternative would be for the United Nations Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court for an advisory opinion . Into this web of problems , the United States this week will dis ? patch James P. Richards , former Democratic Representative from South Carolina , armed with the Eisenhower Doctrine . ' Mr. Richards , who was chair man of the House Foreign ' Affairs Committee when he left Congress last summer , may have a chance ' to do some trading with President Nasser . The Egyptian President is reported to be still willing to talk about the Eisenhower Doctrine . The United States has been maintaining economic pressure against Egypt . The , United States declines to release Egyptian . assets frozen at the time Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Company and has taken no steps to resume the economic aid program . The State Department has also made it difficult if not impossible for Egypt to buy surplus grain here . Vice President Richard M.
