When Ohio 's Governor Frank Lausche appointed Mayor Thomas A. Burke of Cleveland to the U.S. Senate last October , one Ohioan reacted bluntly . Said U.S. Representative George H. Bender : " A New Deal Democrat . . . He will not represent the majority of Ohio . He will substantially misrepresent us . " Last week Bender announced his plan to remedy the situation : he will be a candidate next year for the Senate seat Burke holds . <P> A hearty , heavy ( 200 Ibs. ) insurance man from Cleveland , Bender is remembered by televiewers as the man ringing a bell and singing I 'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover during the demonstrations for Robert A. Taft at the G.O.P. national conventions in 1948 and 1952 . A member of the party 's conservative wing , Bender said he regards the Senate seat he is seeking as " a special trust " because it was held by Taft . Elected to Congress seven times ( six at large and once from the 23rd District ) , Bender has been a good vote-getter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , four-term mayor of Cleveland , who has already announced that he will try to hold the Senate seat , will run strong in his home town . The consensus of Ohio political observers last week : a close race .
