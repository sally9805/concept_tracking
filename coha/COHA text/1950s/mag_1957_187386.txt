In London near week 's end , Britain 's House of Commons passed judgment on the Paris conference . Twice during the day 's debate , shouts of " Treason ! " were hurled at Prime Minister Harold Macmillan from the Visitors ' Gallery . Snapped Aneurin Bevan , Labor 's left-leaning spokesman on foreign affairs : " We are profoundly depressed when representative after representative of the British government . . . has no advice to give to the nation except to build up one more tier of ridiculous armaments on the useless pile we have created . " The government won the vote , 289 to 251 . But its majority was smaller than usual , and five right-wing Tories abstained . <P> All over Europe such enthusiasm as there was for what the NATO Prime Ministers had wrought focused not on the missile-base plan but on the possibility of new talks with Russia . In Britain even the Times of London , voice of the established order , endorsed the idea of negotiations to determine " whether there can not be some limited agreement affecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and the conservative Economist followed suit . <P> Le Populaire , organ of France 's Socialist Party , praised the Prime Ministers for establishing " an equilibrium between political and military imperatives . " And in Belgium the Roman Catholic Het Volk took comfort in the thought that " the Russians will be placed face to face with clear and concrete disarmament proposals . If the Soviets refuse again , a period of painful pessimism may follow , but at least the world will know where it stands . " <P> Happiest of all were the West Germans who , along with many other Europeans , were convinced that Konrad Adenauer had been the star of the show . Even the pro-Socialist Frankfurter Rundschau , ordinarily hostile to Adenauer 's Christian Democrats , hailed the old Chancellor as " the rock of Bonn ... a brilliant tactician who can credit himself with having given the conference the twist that allowed all participants to go home satisfied . " <P> There were specific disappointments . French nationalists complained that the NATO leaders had not given France the ringing endorsement it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Middle East there was widespread wrath at Turkey 's Adnan Menderes . " The Turk will never understand the Arab , " complained a Lebanese daily , outraged because Menderes had not pushed at Paris for the current Arab dream of forcing Israel back inside the restricted borders granted it by the U.N . in 1947 . Fearful of just such a maneuver , Israel 's Premier David Ben-Gurion tried to counter by sending a high-level emissary to Bonn to ask West Germany to plead Israel 's case with the other NATO nations , almost was forced to resign when left-wing members of the Cabinet raised a hue and cry . <P> Most universal sentiment was satisfaction that the U.S. had bowed gracefully to its allies ' views , though the expression of that satisfaction varied from spiteful to appreciative . Gloated the pro-government Frankfurter Neue Presse : " The conference turned into an uprising of the continental Europeans against ... the U.S. " In more balanced appraisal , London 's News Chronicle reported with quiet satisfaction that " the European tail has wagged the American dog to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
