txt Hurrah for initiative . This is a fine day for those in Britain who have felt for some years that hard work did not pay as it should . They are holding their heads high and their step is springy because Chancellor of Exchequer Peter Thorneycroft 's budget introduced in Commons April 9 is aimed at helping them more than anyone else . The tax reliefs are not all that large and most of the recipients are not by any means rich . But the psychological effect of making success respectable and desirable is a novel and wonderful experience . Soak Rich ' Reversed What youthful , zestful Peter Thorneycroft has done is to reverse after long years what many termed a " soak the rich " policy . Admittedly it is only a small beginning and as my economics colleague , John Allan May , says , it may only be a pause to build up the rich a bit so some future government can reimpose heavier taxes . It is agreed , however , that a policy of soaking the rich breaks down when there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gloomy about the possibilities of the future on this spring morning of April 10 when the chancellor has not only declared his policy as " there must be room at the top " but has actually made a start at putting that policy into effect . Historic Scene This reporter has listened to so many austerity budgets and budgets aimed ( quite rightly up to a point ) at easing the lot of the less well-to-do and giving them more social benefits that it was almost unbelievable to be sitting there in that packed , historic Westminster scene listening to a chancellor who dared to hand out benefits to any but the lower-income brackets . For those earning $28,000 a year the chancellor allowed them to keep an extra $1,400 . Those on . the Laborite benches who protested against this surrender to the " haves " conveniently forgot to mention that the $28,000-a-year man would still have to pay $15,400 a year in direct income- and sur-tax . ? But the section of the community for whom this budget was most deliberately shaped consists of the natural scientists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way up to the top with incomes ranging from $5,600 to $14,000 . And it 's only just in time that Associated Press Peter Thorneycroft a move has been made to give them new incentives . In thousands the skilled professional and technological workers of Britain had begun to drain away from Britain to Canada , Australia , New Zealand , and Africa . Said a trainee airline : pilot  --  Harry Lake of Folkestor , Kent ? after he heard the budget news , " If ' it had n't been for this budget I would have gone for ever . Now stay on a bit and sec how things work out . But there 's still no incentive to work overtime . " Taking the case of a salary earner in Britain whose budgetary affairs are well known to this reporter it is possible to reassure the chancellor that the concessions just . awarded are not likely to boost the inflationary spiral very much . Overdraft Easing ? The person in question will pay about $2,520 tax out of his $3,400 dollars earnings instead of ** as hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably use it to repay his bank overdraft or to help with the car installment payments . But just for today nothing is going to spoil that particular person 's joy in being labeled " rich " ( so-called ) and being told by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that he is a good boy and being given the first real " rich man 's " benefit since the days before World War II , since before World War I , maybe since before Queen Victoria 's clay . 13y John Allan May iaff Correvontient or The Christian Science Mo.nttnr London Although politically controversial , Britain 's budget is one of great promise . The controversy may be over an extension of differences in income . The great promise is that if the British people will this year give an extra-special boost to the nation 's exports next year all will have a chance to be richer . This year just a few are to be a little better off . The promise to all the rest is implicit in the biggest budget surplus since the clays of the ultraprudent Socialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majesty 's , Chancellor of the Ex- ' chequer , could have given away 300 million pounds ( 840 million dollars ) in tax reliefs and been as well off as was the previous chancellor , Harold Macmillan . But Mr. Thorneycroft is to give away only 100 millions .. The net result is likely to be a revenue surplus next year of very nearly 500 million pounds . This surplus . 50 per cent bigger still than that Mr. Macmillan budgeted for , is perhaps the most significant item in a budget that so far has been headlined mainly as one of tax reliefs and consequently as a soft budget . lam Tomorrow ' Not only has the chancellOr planned for this gigantic surplus ' but he has also made it clear that the " credit . squeeze " will continue . Installment buying is to remain controlled and expensive . Money is to stay dear , with interest rates high . Those very heavy sales taxes on items like automobiles ( 60 per cent ) arc still to be collected by the taxman . It is thus " jam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just to taste it now as a kind of public advertisement . To pay for jam tomorrow the chancellor clearly is banking on a great expansion of exports. - If more British goods are to he made and sold this year they must be sold mainly abroad . If more are not made there will be a slump . If they are sold at home the trade gap would come back . So there is in this budget very little " incentive " to British production . ? . which has been static now for two years . ' Directing , Arrows ' If additional exports come  --  and only if they conic  --  the British economy can again begin to expand as a strong and stable unit . But that expansion , if and when it comes , could be rapid and spectacular . The benefits of two years of heavy investment have yet to be felt . They could open the way to the strongroom where Mr. Thorneycroft is going to put that 500 million . pounds surplus . and then next year to a great upward surge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax reliefs given now , even added to recent wage increases , are not sufficient themselves to encourage a big growth of demand in Britain itself this year . They are , as Mr. Thorneycroft . himself said , simply " directing arrows all along the path of progress . " ' Defense Economics Mr. Thorneycroft has given some relief to business executives and professional men earning more than 6 thousand dollars a year ( the first time this has happened for many years ) . He declares there must be " room at the top  --  and rewards there too . " He has also clone a little to help family men , by a slight increase in exemptions for children . The tax free investment allowance for capital expenditure on the construction of new ships is increased from 20 per cent to 40 per cent . British corporations trading overseas are freed from British tax on money earned elsewhere . The living theater and all sports are freed from tax altogether . PUrchase taxes on kitchen equipment and carpets are cut . Defense economies are largely responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still save an extra 200 millions .
