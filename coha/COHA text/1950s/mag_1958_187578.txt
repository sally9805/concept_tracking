When Robert B. Anderson Jr . took over as Secretary of the Treasury about a year ago , the nation 's finances were-as even retiring Secretary George M. Humphrey agreed- " in a mess . " The Treasury had to refinance some $75 billion ( 28% ) of the U.S. debt within a year , and the attrition - demands for cash-in refinancing operations had been running as high as an alarming 30% . Secretary Anderson set out to lengthen the average maturity of the federal debt , which had shrunk to 57 months , thus keep the Treasury from going to the market so often . He hoped to lessen competition with municipal and corporate issues , give the Federal Reserve a freer hand in controlling the money supply . In spite of complaints from money men that long-term issues would hinder the easing of money rates , Anderson tried several such issues . He judged the market shrewdly . Fortnight ago his longest-term issue ( 27 years ) , for $1 billion , was heavily oversubscribed . <P> Last week the Treasury announced that it had completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal debt from 58 months to 63 months . Holders of maturing securities gave the Treasury a pleasant surprise , swapped all but 3.7% of their holdings for two new Treasury issues . The Treasury had to pay out only $356 million in cash . It hopes now to stay out of the market until July , when it will refinance $11.5 billion that comes due Aug. i.
