 | The policeman 's tone is n't unfriendly . But it 's firm . " You wo n't be needing your car any more tonight , " he tells you . " You 'd better come along with us . " " With you ! But I ca n't ! I should have been home hours ago ! " " Sorry . I 'm afraid you 'll have to . You 're under arrest . " You 're under arrest ! Just those three words is all that 's needed to put you or any other citizen squarely aboard the conveyor belt known as police procedure . You may or may not be guilty of anything . But once spoken , those words practically guarantee you an ordeal of booking , fingerprinting , bail , delay , worry , and a jail stretch of anywhere from an hour to a weekend , all before the " due process " of the courts can get around to you . Those words are spoken far more often than you might suppose . And their most frequent target is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the normally lawabiding man or woman who , for some reason at some particular moment , becomes involved in an incident that is outside the law . It could happen to anybody . It could happen to you this very evening . Let 's say you have ignored a small collection of parking tickets , and a warrant is issued for your arrest . Or you and your husband are out celebrating a wedding anniversary and an argument with a drunken stranger results in a fight . Or through some terrible mistake , an accusation of a major crime is brought against you or against your husband . Or you and your husband are driving home after a party at a friend 's home and you bump into the rear of a car that stops suddenly ; the traffic officers hold you for " reckless " driving . Whatever the cause , whatever the circumstances , you are under arrest , or your husband is . Would either of you know what to do ? What to expect ? How much to talk ? What to say ? What demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How to avoid or minimize the time spent in jail ? How to be sure of getting your just rights ? If you 're a fair-minded person , you probably want fair and impartial treatment , no more and no less . But in the early stages of an arrest , your situation is not that simple . You 're due for a bad evening . Just how bad depends not so much on your guilt or innocence as on how well you know the ropes of established police procedure . True , the Constitution of the United States of America guarantees certain basic rights . Theoretically you do n't have to say anything , take any tests , or give any evidence against yourself ; and you 're supposed to be taken immediately " before the nearest magistrate " for arraignment . But in actual practice your comfort while getting in and out of jail depends on three things : the degree of your offense , the extent of your knowledge , and the dispositions of the jailer and the arresting officer . You may be free in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days over a holiday weekend . Your constitutional rights have not changed , but society has ; and the job of policing a complex society has resulted in a methodical , rigorous , but necessary police routine . If a woman , you will receive special courtesy but no special dispensation from the arresting officers . For example , you will not undergo " frisking " ? the underarm , back-of-hip patting that experienced officers do so quickly to detect any concealed weapons . Policemen in most cities will not lay hands on a woman citizen unless she is unruly , disorderly , or threatening . If they do arrest her , they will turn her over to a police matron as soon as possible . But whether it 's a policeman or a policewoman , the procedure is then the same . Your name ? Where do you live ? Where have you been ? How did this happen ? Have you been drinking ? How much ? If the incident had anything to do with your operating an automobile , you may be subjected to embarrassing sobriety tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps , stop , turn around , walk back , one foot before the other on a line an inch wide . Or the index-finger test . In this you are required to stand , raise your arms out from your sides , at shoulder height , and close your eyes . Then you are told to try to touch the end of your nose with your index finger . And there 's the speech test . The police ask you to say tricky words and phrases like " electricity , " " Methodist Episcopal , " " around the rugged rock the ragged rascal ran . " And then there is the intoximeter or drunkometer . This is new but legal . It consists of a red balloon connected to test tubes in something like a bagpipe arrangement . When the suspect blows into the balloon , his breath comes into contact with chemicals in the test tubes . If he or she has had enough to drink to affect vision , reflexes , or judgment , the chemicals will change color in a matter of seconds . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution , although such refusal in many states will be reported to the court as prima-facie indication of intoxication . You can not be forced to do anything ? except go to jail . Officers can handcuff you , but in most states they  | usually handcuff only the seasoned criminal or the difficult prisoner . How much talking should you do ? If you see fit , you may refuse to say anything . The Fifth Amendment declares specifically that no one can be compelled to be a witness against himself . In serious cases you are well within your practical rights to sit tight and let your attorney do the talking . However , such closemouthedness is not likely to win any special favors from the arresting officers , and in most cases you 'd do your own cause more good by answering at least the routine questions briefly and specifically . As for volunteering information , you should remember that what seems like a bright thing to say under the excitement of the moment might embarrass you later on , when it 's read out of context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrest you ? and his decision to do so is already made for him if there is personal injury or damage to property involved ? no amount of additional information is going to change his mind . It will simply be reported at second hand to headquarters , where you might better do the reporting yourself in the presence of your attorney . YOU should brace yourself for the curious , who gather wherever a siren wails , and the newspaper photographers , who travel in cars equipped with telephones and two-way radio and reach the scene almost as fast as the police . There is nothing you can do to avoid the press . Your only hope for anonymity is in there being nothing newsworthy about your misery . This is usually the case unless your name already means something to the papers or unless you tell them something to " tag " you with ? e.g. , you once took a screen test , won a beauty contest , or tried out for a TV show . There 's no point in going out of your way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunt " pictures , and no police officer has any right to order you to do so . If the press persists , however , you 'll be better off in the long run to co-operate to some degree . Tell the reporters the points of fact , avoiding any temptation to slur anyone or make wisecracks . By themselves your troubles probably are n't worth a line , but one flip comment from you can put them in headlines . The duller you seem to be , the less space you 'll get . Photographers will probably flash action pictures of you just to cover themselves . This does not necessarily mean such pictures will be published . If they 're really interested , they will ask you to pose , and if they insist , your best defense is to yield gracefully . Be friendly and tactful , but see to it that no picture shows you as anything but dignified and composed . Shun " leg art " poses , and do n't be talked into waving or blowing kisses . If possible , avoid telltale backgrounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too stubborn ' or the photographers will grab what shots they can , flattering or otherwise . Just remember that your best chance of not being published is to , be photographically unexciting . Never resist pictures by covering your face or grabbing for the camera . There may be another photographer nearby to record your rage , and that very act will put you on page one , but good . What happens after your arrest varies  | a little from city to city , but the following details are generally typical . En route to jail in the radio patrol car , you will hear over the two-way radio a small sample of the big job of policing a major city . Every few seconds a call . Over 300 calls an hour , 24 hours a day . A man molesting a woman . A speeding motorcycle . A disturbance . A missing juvenile . A drunk weaving down Main Street . A few minutes ago you were the subject of one of those calls . Right now your arresting officer picks up his microphone and talks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description , address , and if you are an average citizen , you hear the operator come back in less than two minutes with " Six-a-fourteen " ( the number of the radio patrol car ) , " no record , no want . " This means that your name has been checked by the record and identification bureau of the city 's police department and they have n't found a thing wrong with you . But your arresting officer thinks he has , so he takes you to jail . Your name is entered on the jail register , and the jailer fills out an " Order for Admittance and Property Receipt . " This is commonly known as the booking form . It will list property you have with you : the contents of your purse and pockets , your watch ? make , case number , movement , initials . Your money is counted in front of you , and you may be asked to verify the amount . Everything but your watch and your cigarettes is placed in a Manila envelope , which is sealed and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You hear the jailer call the record bureau and obtain a number , which is affixed on all forms associated with your arrest . THEN you are " printed and mugged . " If you refuse to be fingerprinted , in most states you will not be released on bail , bond , or writ until you change your mind . And if for any reason the officers want your fingerprints immediately , they can force you against your will to submit to printing . Fingerprinting has been upheld by the United States Supreme Court as a necessary means of obtaining positive identification , and as such a legal and required step in booking . The jailer will make four complete sets of your fingerprints ? two for local police records , one for the state capitol , and one for the FBI in Washington , D. C. He will take four pictures of you ? two front views , a left profile , and a right profile . There is nothing rigorous about this , but it is usually at this time that a person experiencing his first arrest begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he has n't tried before , this is when he may attempt to talk his way out of jail or think of trying to bribe the jailer . He may worry again about a report of the arrest appearing in the newspapers , and he 'll ask the jailer to keep the records away from the reporters . The jailer can only listen and be official . To him , again , everything is procedure . There is no way he can let anyone go without due process of law . Once you are inside his jail , it takes an official act to get you out . And there is no way the jailer can legally keep the record of any arrest from reporters . After booking , the extent of your difficulties hinges on whether your alleged offense is a misdemeanor ( minor crime ) or a felony ( major crime ) under the statutes of your state . In one state simple drunken driving is a misdemeanor but  | drunken driving that causes personal injury is a felony . With felonies the handling of prisoners varies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But for misdemeanors the procedure is usually standard . At the time of booking you are directed to appear in court on a certain date , usually several weeks hence , and you are kept in jail until that date unless you can post tail , in which case you are released pending trial . IN MOST large cities the jailer hands you a copy of the booking form . A typical one lists some of your rights : " Inform jailer in charge if you wish to make bail . You may request to make bail on bailable offenses any time , day or night , and the jailer will assist by providing a form for your use . " Bail is an amount of money you deposit with the police or court clerk to insure your appearance in court . When you go to court , you get this money back . The amount of bail for misdemeanors is automatically set by law . You should ask the jailer as you 're being booked what the bail is for your offense . In California , for example , bail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you do not have that much cash with you , you must get it from some friend or relative , or obtain a bail bond , which is simply a type of insurance policy issued in the amount of your bail . The cost , or premium , is 10 per cent of the amount , or $25 for a $250 bond . If you fail to appear in court on the date set , the bonding company or bondsman must pay the court the full $250 and you are subject to rearrest . At your trial the bond is canceled , but you never get any part of the $25 premium back . There is a bail-bond office near almost every jail . If you do not know a bail bondsman , most police departments will call one for you . Because the premium is high , it is best to post cash when you can get it . But how do you get it ? Paragraph 3 on the back of a typical booking form states , " Local telephone messages of a strictly business nature will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No prisoner is permitted to use the telephone . " Knowing this , you should ask your jailer , before he locks you in a cell , to make a telephone call for you . Later on he may be too busy , and you will simply have to sit there . The booking form says " messages , " but the police interpret this to mean one call . So select the c:d1 carefully . Mother ? Husband ? Wife ? Boss ? Old school tie ? The most sensible thing is to call an attorney . If you do n't have an attorney . you should try to think now of one you ' ire met somewhere and file his name in you , memory . Once he 's taken your case , he 'll call your family or business and calmly report your arrest . He 'll try to obtain bail immediately . If it 's urgent to do so , he can have you released within a few hours . If you do n't know an attorney , ask the jailer to call the most reliable member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attorney or bail bondsman . If you decide to work out your own solution , ask the jailer to call a bail bondsman immediately . In any event be prepared for a fairly long wait . The average time for getting released in misdemeanor cases is five hours . An efficient jailer will be glad to help you as soon as is possible , unless you have been disorderly or unless you are incapable at the moment of conducting  | yourself properly . But remember , to him you are only a number . On Friday nights and weekends and during holiday seasons the jailer is very busy . He may have a difficult prisoner in the next cell , or he may have a dozen or so common drunks waiting to be booked , and he ca n't stop to help you if there are more demanding jail problems You can shout for your constitutional rights all you please , but you 'll get them only when the jailer has time for you . Your situation is more complicated if you are charged with a felony , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or grand theft . You must wait until the police take you to court , although an attorney can sometimes get a judge to free you on a writ of habeas corpus ? the ancient law , written into the Constitution , which guarantees your liberty unless a formal complaint has been filed against you and a warrant issued for your arrest . So on a felony charge you will probably stay in jail overnight or through a weekend unless you are arrested fairly arly in the day . The police are anxious to take you before a judge as soon as possible . The law commands them to . But they must complete their routine . r t . As soon as they have made their investigation , they will take you to the squad room or district attorney 's office The latter is usually called " the D.A ' s bull pen , " a large , plain room guarded by a policeman . Prisoners wait here while detectives obtain a complaint and a detailed " make sheet " ? a fairly comprehensive report on you , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime . It will also contain the district attorney 's recommendation for bail . Waiting for this , you may spend several hours in the bull pen , in company with from ten to twenty common burglars , sex perverts , child molesters , or dope addicts . Once the district attorney issues the complaint , you will be taken to a lower court and arraigned . ARRAIGNMENT will be your first chance at official court procedure in he case Here you will be formally ac , : used of a specific crime . Henceforth it will be up to the courts , not the police , to decide what happens to you . The judge will state whether you are to be released pending further trial and will set the amount of bail . But since the purpose of bail is only to guarantee your appearance for trial , you can appeal to the judge to reduce the amount . Quite often a judge may suspend bail entirely and release a prisoner on his or her " own recognizance . " This is a nice accolade to your community standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put through the arrest mill like a common criminal , eaten jail food , and found yourself with a police record , long before any court has passed on your guilt or innocence . Most police officers admit this is an unfair situation but point out that their function is to enforce the laws by apprehending violators , not to roll out the red carpet for every transgressor they catch on a busy night . Police stations are not country clubs , nor would you as a taxpayer want to see too many expensive courtesies added for the benefit of arrested citizens And remember , once you 're in the courtroom , the wheels of justice settle down to an orderly pace and you 're guaranteed the fairest legal treatment in the world .
