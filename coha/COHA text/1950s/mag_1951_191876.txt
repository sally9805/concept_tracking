Stout , amiable Joseph Pholien , a lawyer who helped found Belgium 's postwar Social Christian Party , unexpectedly became Belgium 's Premier last October , after the royal abdication crisis had forced Premier Jean Duvieusart to resign . Pholien grew very fond of his new office . He was irritated , however , by the globetrotting reminiscences of Foreign Minister Paul Van Zeeland , ex-Premier Paul-Henri Spaak , and other colleagues . <P> Last month 66-year-old Premier Pholien decided to make his first visit to the U.S. He and Madame Pholien quietly paid their own fares on a scheduled Sabena Airline flight to New York . After some hurried sightseeing in Manhattan , the Pholiens , accompanied by State Department and Belgian officials , left Washington last week for a look at the country . They inspected a General Motors truck plant in Detroit and a chemical factory in Muscle Shoals , Ala. , rode in a helicopter at Wright Field . Back in Washington the Premier had lunch at Blair House with Dean Acheson and Harry Truman . <P> This week , pleased and impressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
