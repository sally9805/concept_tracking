txt Statistics , like buzz saws , should be approached with caution . But recently across the desk came a batch of them we have no wish to challenge . Also we have no doubt that these particular statistics will receive no welcome from the great and growing company of do-it-yourself addicts or from the firms which sell the tools and materials the Mr. Fixits use . These statistics , gathered by Mr. Arthur Burroughs of the American Mutual Liability Insurance Company , show that on an average 115,000 people are injured every year doing home carpentry ; more than 98,000 are hurt fixing furniture ; 93.01111 cut themselves replacing broken window panes ; 33,000 are hurt while pruning trees and 76,000become casualties while painting their houses . Carpentry tools are involved in 72,000 accident cases and power tools in 191.000 . And it 's not only bad luck to walk under ladders-300,000 people are hurt because they insist on climbing up them . Well , this is the time of the year when spring 's gentle brush paints the world anew and the ladies want the houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are windows to be repaired and roof gutters to be mended and we intend to make full use of these statistics . We intend also to make as full use of springtime as we can . We only wonder what are the statistics on accidents in hammocks.
