txt COMPROMISE SEEN ON HOUSING BY CITY 200-Block West Side Project ' Is Expected to Shrink to Four-Block Pilot Task Ey CHARLES GRUTZNER Mayor Wagner 's vast West Side rehabilitation project has run into unexpected opposition to some of its phases . This has come from within the circle of the Mayor 's own expert advisers . As a result , a compromise is being considered to begin with a pilot project of four or six city blocks instead of the bold program , outlined by the Mayor to a Congressional subcommittee last October , of having the entire 200 blocky between Fifty-ninth and 125t1 . Streets , from Central Park to the Hudson River , declared an urban renewal area . Under the original plan , the City Planning Commission was to , give its approval , before next Saturday to an urban renewal ' designation for the entire area ? This would make private capital ' eligible for substantial Federal inortgage financing . It would , the Mayor hoped , induce intensive private rehabilitation of old , dwellings and construction of new buildings in blocks adjoining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Side . There will be no such action by the commission in the re // maiming days of this year . City officials are disinclined to talk about the delay . or to say when or in what form the project may reach the commission . Mayor Wagner made public the plan for a concentrated and coordinated effort by city , state and Federal agencies and private capital to rehabilitate the West Side on Oct. 5 , when he testified at a public hearing held here by the House Subcommittee on Housing . As the Mayor outlined the project then , the City Housing Authority would spread as much public housing as it could through the area , in individual blocks rather than in super-block developments . Slum buildings would be demolished . Buildings that had deteriorated but were still sturdy  --  such as many brownstones  --  would be rehabilitated by the city in some cases , by private owners in others . Modern , good buildings would be untouched while older structures adjoining them would be razed or renovated . Federal and state aid were assured for some phases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House subcommittee , the Mayor had stressed the role private enterprise was expected to play . He had said : " The key to success lies not in the amount of Federal and city monies , put directly into public housing in the area . The key to success lies in the way we operate to encourage private ) enterprise to go in . It has always been pardonably loath to risk substantial sums on real estate in an area declining in values . " We feel that if we set the ' pace , as we reclaim a threeblock section here and another there , private enterprise , using the public credit under the urban renewal law , will go in and reconstruct the adjoining blocks , since the area will be on the way up again . " Allowance For Difficulty The Mayor had tempered his enthusiasm with an allowance for the possibility of unforeseen difficulty . He had told the House subcommittee : " We think it will work . We intend to try it , unless we become convinced , somewhere along the line still ahead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can not work . " The Mayor , the City Housing Authority , the State Division of Housing and some Federal housing officials are still determined to make a try at urban redevelopment over as large a West Side area as conditions will permit , according to the best available information . One sticking point appears to be divided opinion within the Mayor 's official family as to how far the city should go in such an area toward rehabilitating run , down buildings . Several business , civic and church groups on the West Side have been seeking assurance from City Hall that the project would move ahead ae originally outlined , No such assurance has been given . The only official explanation offered for the delay in getting the necessary first step taken in the City Planning Commission has been that the new chairman , James A. Felt  --  who will succeed John J. Bennett Jr . In that post next Sunday  --  should be in on the matter from its inception in the commission . Mr. Felt has , in fact , been in on the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Housing Authority and the Mayor 's Committee for Better Housing .
