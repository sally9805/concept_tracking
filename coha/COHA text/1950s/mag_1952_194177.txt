With a blast of newspaper ads last week , Westinghouse Electric Corp . boasted it had " the world 's most powerful jet engine qualified for production . " The new model of its J40 turbojet , said Westinghouse , produces " more than 25,000 h.p. at flight speeds , " will go into the Navy 's McDonnell Demon and Douglas Skyray fighters . <P> Aircraft men smiled at Westinghouse 's sweeping claims . Horsepower " at flight speeds " is a misleading phrase , since jet horsepower varies with a plane 's speed , altitude and other factors . The standard measure of jet power is pounds of static thrust at 375 m.p.h. at sea level . In those terms , the J-40 's thrust is somewhere around 10,000 Ibs . But this was with afterburner attachments ( which eat fuel so fast they can only be used in short bursts ) . Without afterburners , guessed American Aviation Daily , the J-40 's thrust is closer to 8,500 Ibs . <P> Nevertheless , this made the J40 momentarily the most powerful , because it has " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on stand . Pratt &; Whitney 's J57 engine , which produces 10,000 Ibs. thrust without burners , has not yet been " qualified , " although it is already flying in the B-52 . <P> If not quite as advertised , the J40 is. nevertheless , a milestone in Westinghouse 's progress in the engine field . Westinghouse , which was ' the first company to produce an American-designed jet engine in World War II , now also supplies the engines which power several Navy fighters . President Gwilym Price has poured on the coal to expand Westinghouse , not only in jets but in other propulsion fields . Among them : gas turbines ( for locomotives ) , atomic power ( for submarines and supercarriers ) , marine engines ( for the superliner United States and Arctic icebreakers ) . As a result of Price 's efforts , enginemaking is now 20% of Westinghouse 's business and he plans to make it more . Said he : " We live in a footloose age , in a world of motion .
