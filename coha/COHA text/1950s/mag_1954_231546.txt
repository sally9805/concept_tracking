Handsome Jean Sainteny , 47 , looked like the very Frenchman to talk coexistence with Ho Chi Minh . Sainteny served before the Indo-China war as French Commissioner in Hanoi , and wrote a bitterly anti-U.S. , pro-Ho book about it . He was subsequently wounded by an exploding Communist hand grenade , but this did not dim his ardor for Ho , whom he called " the Gandhi of Indo-China . " <P> <P> Last October Sainteny set out for Hanoi with a 20-man mission and the blessings of Premier Pierre Mends-France . Sainteny defined his objective as " preventing bridges being burned , " argued that the Vietnamese people of Hanoi must surely need French culture , and that French technical assistance might create a Tito out of Ho . More skeptical Westerners shook their heads . " Sainteny 's a nice fellow , " said one , " but he believes in fairies . " <P> Last week in Hanoi , Sainteny proudly unveiled something he called " an agreement , " but which Ho Chi Minh referred to as a " joint declaration between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title ) and a delegation of French economic experts . " French business firms could " retain present form , " it was proclaimed , but only subject to Ho 's " sovereignty and legislation . " French products could be " freely " sold , but Ho 's government orders " must be executed first . " French businessmen could " freely " send profits abroad , but the percentages and other such details would be worked out later " by common agreement . " Frenchmen themselves could only move in and out of the country " within the framework " of Ho 's Communist laws . Sainteny apparently thought that the deal would guarantee security to French businessmen who chose to stay in Hanoi , but the businessmen were not so naive . Few rose to the bait .
