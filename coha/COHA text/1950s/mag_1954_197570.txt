Inside the dirty red brick fortress of Spandau in the British sector of Berlin , behind a maze of walls , electric fences and steel doors guarded by the machine guns and soldiers of four nations , Prisoner No. 3 , an old man of 81 , was dying . Once , <P> Baron Konstantin von Neurath , fluent linguist and brilliant diplomatist , had suavely served the Weimar Republic as Foreign Minister , then without apparent twinge of conscience served Hitler . In 1941 he finally resigned as Hitler 's " Protector " of Bohemia-Moravia , but by then he had gone too far ; the verdict at Nrnberg in 1946 was : " For carrying out and assuming responsibility for the execution of the foreign policy of the Nazi conspirators , and authorizing , directing and taking part in war crimes and crimes against humanity-fifteen years ' imprisonment . " <P> Now , after eight years and one month of his sentence , No. 3 could barely see because of the cataracts in his eyes . Afternoons he worked in the prison gardens where occasionally his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry out and sink stiffly to the ground . A waiting guard would rush forward , break a Trinitrin capsule under his nose and the old man would get up and go back to work . <P> Six in the Audience . He was the only one of the war criminals in Spandau who got along with all six of his companions . Albert Speer , No. 5 , Hitler 's production genius , said : " If we did n't have Von Neurath , we would all go crazy . " They were an ill-assorted lot : fat , bald , obscene Walter Funk ( No. 6 ) ; rich , young , suicidal Baldur von Schirach ( No. 1 ) ; dangerous , unrepentant ex-Admiral Karl Doenitz ( No. 2 ) ; weird , half-sane Rudolf Hess ( No. 7 ) : arthritic , pious ex-Admiral Erich Raeder ( No. 4 ) . Von Neurath would recall for them the glittering days when he was his country 's envoy to the Kings of Italy and Great Britain . He had been a childhood friend of Britain 's Queen Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once he saved her from being burned to death in her bedroom . <P> In Spandau , with his unloved and unloving mates , he was always courteous and rarely complained , as they did . But to his wife , the baroness , he wrote : " I do n't think I can stand it much longer . " Repeatedly , Britain , France and the U.S. suggested to Russia ( which shares in the running of Spandau ) that old Baron von Neurath be let out of prison to die . Each time the Russians said no . Sir Winston Churchill confessed in the House of Commons : " Von Neurath has my sympathy . " <P> Four in Agreement . Last week to everyone 's surprise , Soviet High Commissioner Georgi Pushkin suddenly proposed Von Neurath 's " premature " release . The Russians obviously hoped thereby to gain a little favor with nationalistic Germany . " Tactical humanitarianism , " snorted the Mannheimer Morgen , but the allies sent identical replies to the Soviets : " My government agrees . . . " <P> At 11:50 one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prison on a cane , smiled briefly , and with his daughter at his side rode to freedom in a hired automobile . Nothing he owned at war 's end fitted him now , and he wore corduroy trousers , a checked shirt , a green tie , and a cheap jacket , from which his jailers only the night before had removed the large numeral 3.
