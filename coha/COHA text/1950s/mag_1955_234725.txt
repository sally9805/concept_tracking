For three-quarters of a century , the sun never set on Grove 's Dictionary of Music and Musicians . For archivists and amateurs , professors and performers around the world , England 's queen-size compendium* was the first authority on the ways and means of music . But the fourth edition of Grove 's ( published in 1940 ) was much the same as the first ( 1878 ) , and after World War II , London 's Macmillan &; Co. decided it was high time for a completely revised edition . After nearly ten years of labor-by about 500 contributors under the stern supervision of London Music Critic and Scholar Eric Blom-Grove V is out at last . Almost twice as big as the 1940 edition , it runs to a weighty nine volumes ( at $127.50 a set ) that fascinatingly reflect the world of music in mid-20th century . <P> Film to Concrete . Among the new developments since Grove IV : The phonograph ( called gramophone in British English ) , which in 1940 got 3 pages plus a perfunctory listing under MECHANICAL APPLIANCES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight pages in 1954 , including the comment that " all over Europe . . . American technicians are to be found with their spools of recording tape . " Film music , with no listing in Grove IV , gets 16 pages documenting the art from its early catch-all scores ( catalogued as The Slimy Viper , Gruesome Misterioso , Love 's Response , etc. ) to background music by such recognized modern composers as Copland , Honegger and Prokofiev , with learned descriptions of how music is photographed on film and a running account of how a film composer operates . <P> CONCRETE MUSIC , a recent development involving recorded natural sounds that are edited and ( usually ) electronically transformed into ( usually ) hair-raising compositions , gets a stiff nod . Grove 's admits that it " does represent a new means of expression . " The diminished seventh , a foreboding chord much abused by 19th century composers and some 20th century organists , gets its comeuppance . Because it has four notes belonging to widely distant keys , Editor Blom recalls a reference to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to get to any destination in the shortest possible time . . . " He adds , " It became stale . . . not only because later composers abused its sensational nature but also because as a harmonic device it represents a line of least resistance . " Schoenberg 's once highly controversial twelve-tone system is recognized as a technique of worldwide significance in 20th century composition . <P> Jazz still " occupies a place entirely apart , " but is given a complete chronicling from its African " origins through bop . In Grove IV , blues were kissed off with a See FOX TROT . <P> Beethoven to Mendelssohn . As a result of Editor Blom 's uninhibited pen ( always filled with green ink ) , much of Grove V is merry and informative , * avoids the sentimental dogma of earlier editions .
