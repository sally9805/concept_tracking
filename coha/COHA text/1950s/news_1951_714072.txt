txt A. R Li ACTS TO STOP WORKING WITH Cilia ; UNITY HOPES END Executive Council Votes for Break Which Will Affect Defense Cooperation CONVENTION ACTION DUE Large Majority of Governing Board Finds Only Adverse Results From Tie-Up By LOUIS STARK Special to THE NEW Yoax Train . WASHINGTON , Aug. 14 ? Organized labor 's " general staff , " formed in December to deal with problems of defense mobilization and wage-price control , faces early collapse . The executive council of the American Federation of Labor has authorized William Green , A. F. L , president , to take steps to dissolve the partnership that has united the A. F. L. and the Congress of Industrial Organizations in their . attempt to attain common objectives . The action was taken late last week at the A. F. L. executive council meeting in Montreal . The move to break the ties forged between the two labor federations in the last nine months was led by George Meany , A. F. L. secretary-treasurer . Daniel J. Tobin , president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Voting for the proposal were Messrs . Meany , Tobin , Green , Matthew Woll , Herman Winter , Harry C. Bates , W. C. Birthright , W. C. Doherty , David Dubinsky , James C. Petrillo and William L , . Only Two Opposing Votes Voting in opposition were Daniel J. Tracy and George M. Harrison , Mr. Tracy is president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and Mr. Harrison is president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Clerks . Absent members of the council were Charles J. and William L. Hutcheson . A spokesman for the C. I. 0 . expressed today his " surprise and astonishment " at the A. F. L. governing body 's decision . Comment by Philip Murray , C. I. 0 . president , was not immediately forthcoming . It was pointed out on his behalf that Mr. Murray had recently extolled the work of the fourteen - member United Labor Policy Committee as " most constructive . " It is understood that Mr. Green was requested by the A.F.L. council to advise the International Association of Machinists and the Railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C.I.O. and the A.F.L. these organizations constitute the United Labor Policy Committee . The resolution adopted by the A. F. L. council is in the form of a recommendation that will go before the A. F. L. annual convention to be held in San Francisco , beginning Sept. 17 . Since eleven of the thirteen members of the Executive Council wile were present favored the action , it is unlikely that the convention will turn down the recommendation . After convention ratification Mr. Green will formally advise Mr. Murray that thenceforth the A.F.L. and the C.I.O. must go their separate ways . C. I. 0 . Called Sole Gainer The news of the imminent dissolution of the United Labor Policy Committee will come as a blow to many in the labor movement who have been hoping that this temporary committee might lead to an ultimate merger of the A. F. L. and C. I. 0 . and an end of the fifteen-year major split - in labor 's ranks . The principal argument advanced by those who supported the drastic move when the question was raised without advance notice by Mr. Meany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the A. F. L.-C . I. 0 . collaboration and the A. F. L. had not . It was recalled that Mr. Murray was an advocate of what he calls " functional unity , " that is , day by day collaboration by the A. F. L. and the C. L 0 . on specific objectives . By learning to work together in the legislative and economic field , Mr. Murray believed , the two federations might eventually work out a solution of their difficult jurisdictional problems . But the A. F. L. held to an undeviating policy demanding " organic unity , " that is , a direct merger of the two organizations . " We will not continue what has // become a fake united front , " said one top A. F. L. leader today . " The C. I. 0 . has utilized its advantage in recent months because of our cooperation to strengthen itself in various ways and in certain government organizations . We persist in our desire for real ' organic unity of the two organizations and we reject functional unity . " Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had peace committees in existence for fifteen years . Last summer some progress toward resolving differences was made and a subcommittee composed of Mr. of the A. F. L. and Allan Haywood of the C. I. 0 . was named to work out an agenda for subsequent meetings . For some unexplained reason the two committees never met . However , the United Labor Policy Committee was formed in December on the assumption that during the emergency the A. F. L. , the C. I. 0. , the railway unions and the Machinists ( then independent of the A. F. L. but now affiliated ) could work together in a solid front to advance defense and other policies . Rebellion on Defense The United Labor Policy Committee dramatized in February a rebellion against the Wage Stabilization Board 's policy by withdrawing the labor members from the board and from other defense agencies . The protest was leveled against a wage increase ceiling of 10 per cent announced by the tripartite ( labor , industry , public ) wage board . It was also aimed at what the unions felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all policy making and operational defense agencies . The grievances were adjusted by President Truman in a series of conferences that brought the labor representatives back into the fold after two months . The ouster. by the C. I. 0 . in January of eleven unions allegedly following the Communist line apparently cemented the budding friendship of the A. F. L. and C. I. 0 . Some labor leaders said that nothing that had occurred since the 1936 split between the two labor federations was of greater importance toward healing the rift than this C. I. 0 . action . Subsequently the A. F. L. and C. I. 0 . collaborated on policies for presentation to the meeting of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in Milan last month . While outwardly the A. F. L. and C. I. 0 . delegates to this meeting had cordial relations , there were behind the scenes some incidents that disturbed both organizations . The A. F. L. top hierarchy ig also rather irked at what it considers the prominent activity of C. I. O. representatives in the Economic Cooperation Administration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
