the first year in which Americans spent as much time on a single leisure occupation as they did on their jobs . That occupation , of course , was watching television . If the research services of the networks can be believed , the total time involved mounts in a single year to more than 130 billion man- , woman- , and child-hours . Historians will note particularly that the average viewing audience at ten o'clock on an ordinary evening in 1956 is larger than the voting electorate which chooses the President ? sixty to seventy million people . This enormous audience divides up among some 430 television stations . Perhaps three-quarters of it belongs to the 250 stations which broadcast at ten o'clock the programs sent out by the CBS or NBC television networks . What this audience will see is decided by the networks , which can , as an ordinary matter , " option " the time necessary to present their key programs on their affiliated stations . The making of this decision is ? depending on whom you talk to ? either a great privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden . Between them , the two major networks are on the air some 9,000 hours a year , and every hour must be at least superficially different from every other hour . Network shows are rarely repeated ; this is a tradition inherited from radio ? one of the few to survive . Programing itself is , in fact , a new network function . In the radio days networks sold to an advertiser the use of their facilities and a time period on their affiliated stations ; and the advertiser 's agency then " packaged " the program which was put on the air . A modest network program department existed to fill up the time not sold to sponsors , and a network " continuity acceptance " department watched out for rude words , libel , or political references which might get the network in trouble . Otherwise the ad-vertiser ran the show . He " owned " the time . From the beginning , television found this method of operation unworkable . Only 16,000 American homes had television sets in 1947 , when NBC began to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hour " on Monday nights . This new assumption of responsibility is not exclusively a public service , even though the FCC approves . Programs draw audiences , which are what the networks sell to advertisers . A strong program may lure an audience that will stay tuned to the network 's stations all night long ; a weak program may lose millions of viewers who will not return until another evening . The relationship between program popularity and network profitability is direct and obvious . For example , in 1952 CBS Television passed NBC in the aggregate popularity of its programs ; the animal report to CBS stockholders two years later featured the proud but simple statement : " In 1954 the CBS Television Network became the largest single advertising medium in the world . " The departments that plan programs and arrange schedules have become the darlings of the networks , and their executives have first crack at the corner offices , the air conditioning , the custom-designed furniture . Policy conferences from which vice presidents are excluded to save space and time will often be attended by mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried too far . It was NBC Chairman Pat Weaver 's interest in programs rather than money which led to his resignation a few weeks ago . WEAVER 'S STRATEGY p R O G R A M planners and executive producers belong to management . Though their work is largely creative , they are not " creative personnel " ; rather , they are The Lords of Creation . Planners do what Pat Weaver used to call " strategic thinking " ? as distinguished from " tactical thinking , " which involves the actual physical production of programs , the counting of affiliated stations or thousand-dollar bills . " Strategic thinking " itself is a large and airy realm in which Weaver -- who lived on a more exalted level than anyone else who had ever been in broadcasting ( or any other business , for that matter ) ? moved with peculiar ease and individual grace . " I do n't think any people can understand strategic thinking in television , " Weaver said shortly before his resignation , " unless they are essentially broadcast-trained people . . . . Nowadays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minority experience in American society . I think this is because of Hollywood'sstrategic approach in opposition to that of the advertising-trained men who look at all America as their total market , because they must do so when they deal with the popular brands . " Weaver is thoroughly advertising-trained Though he is only forty-eight , he has been a major figure in national broadcasting for two decades . He is a Californian with an Ivy League education , a low-pressure enthusiast , very tall and almost indecently youthful , with freckles , jug ears , and sandy hair . He has climbed on all sides of the **30;1034;TOOLONG triangle ? as manager of the radio department for Young and Rubicam , advertising manager for American Tobacco during the glory days of George Washington Hill , and , from 1949 to September 8 , 1956 , ( in what are already known as the glory days of Pat Weaver ) as a top officer of NBC . Weaver devoted much of his time at NBC to the systematic destruction of the strategic approach which television derived from radio . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Weaver launched the Spectacular ( his own word ) , which will not appear next week , same time , same station , and which can run anywhere from ninety minutes to three hours . He had written into all NBC contracts with advertisers a " pre-emption " clause , giving the network the right to take away the advertiser 's time and program whenever it had something extra-special to present . Even where programs appear on a daily basis , Weaver tried to avoid the establishment of a formula for them . One-third of NBC network time is devoted to " Today " ( which is planned to prepare the early riser to read his morning paper ) , " Home " ( a kind of women 's magazine of the air ) , and " Tonight " ( the theatrical section of a tabloid )  - -  all casual , what 's new shows which the viewer is supposed to tune in because he does n't know what 's going to be on . Weaver 's approach to sponsorship was equally original . He pioneered what he called the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertisements on programs the way a magazine sells pages . ( " If you do n't sell all the spots , " said one of his assistants bravely , " it 's like a thin issue of a magazine . " ) In bringing forth the ultra-expensive Spectacular ( the two presentations of ' ' Peter Pan " cost their sponsor more than $600,000 ) , Weaver virtually abandoned the classic cost-per-thousand measurement which advertisers traditionally use to determine whether they are getting their money 's worth of audience . TELEVISION 'S LORDS OF CREATION ? g Program Development as a department of CBS dates only from the arrival of Weltman a few months ago ; NBC has had such a department for seven years , since the early days of Weaver . NBC 's first director was Fred Coe , who developed " Television Playhouse " and its writers , and left Development to produce the show . Coe was followed by Pete Barnum , whose work culminated in " Four Star Review , " on which the key credit card read : " Produced by Pete Barnum . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew enamored of the idea behind the " U.S. Rubber Show " and like his predecessors became a producer . HOW TO FIND TALENT T THIS point Weaver decided a bit grimly that creative personnel were incorrigible tactical thinkers , and went looking for a management man who could do strategic thinking and stay with it . He turned to Leonard Hole , a small , spare , precise man in glasses with half horn-rims , who was then production director in charge of all NBC 's physical and mechanical facilities and their use . Hole 's experience ? as manager of Dumont 's New York station and operations director of the Dumont Network in the early days of network television ? guaranteed his understanding of programing problems . Moreover , his imagination had been proved by an outstanding contribution to the success of " Today . " As production director , Hole was primarily concerned about housing for Weaver 's pet new project . " You could n't , " Hole said recently , " tie up two studios for two hours , every morning . Not in those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office one afternoon , and I walked up 19th Street . I looked into the windows of the RCA Exhibition Hall . I turned right around , went back to the office , straight to Pat , and I said , ' Come with me . ' Pat said , ' What for ? would n't tell him , I just led him away . He looked at the Exhibition Hall and all he said was , ' Yeh-h-h . ' Next I heard , he was up with the General making arrangements for ' Today ' to use the Exhibition Hall as a studio . " ( Because of the number of Sarnoffs working in and around RCA , the name " Sarnoff " is never used . Robert Sarnoff , president of NBC , is always " Bobby . " His father , Brigadier General David A. Sarnoff , chairman of the board of RCA , NBC 's parent company , is always , simply , " the General . " ) Hole 's first assignment was to find new supports for NBC 's wobbly comedy establishment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chicago Press he wrote all the nation 's college newspapers , magazines , and dramatic societies ; through the station-relations department he wrote to four hundred managers of broadcasting stations . He also got in touch with established comics and their writers , and asked them to refer inquiries from aspiring funny men to NBC Development . The response poured in for several months . After a while they lost track of the exact number of people who replied to the NBC invitation , but it was between 13,000 and 14,000 . " The big bulk of the entries , of course , " Hole said , " were carbons , stuff we 'd seen before . In no time we were down to nine hundred . We asked those nine hundred to pick a comic they felt comfortable with , write some material designed for him , and that reduced the list to thirty . Then we took their stuff to Ace , Caesar , Hope , Pat , the General , lots of others , and everyone agreed that nine of our writers showed great promise . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is , we have them for seven years if we want them ; we can drop them any time . Since then we 've added a few , dropped a few , and we 're back to nine . They work for the Development Department , we pay their salaries , but they sit in on writing sessions with the great comics . If they turn out good material in those sessions and the stars want ' ern , the stars keep ' em , and they 're off our payroll . " Those who do not catch on with the great comics are employed writing material for the beginning and semi-successful comedians hauled in to NBC by the same net that caught the writers . Last year an effort was made to use these unknown talents commercially , with Leo Durocher as MC , in the time slot opposite Ed Sullivan ; the effort failed , to say the least . Now the young comedians display the results of their studies only to members of the Development Department . Most of what the department sees it junks ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every once in a while it puts something aside in the small pile of material which will some day be a series of programs . The waste is considered normal and proper . " If we can get two or three useful people out of it , " Hole said , " all the money comes back . " Weaver had set Isis sights higher : " One Godfrey , and we make money . " At present NBC has especially high hopes for two of its youngsters , neither of them completely untried ? Jonathan Winters and Kaye Ballard . September by Barry , who was sole producer of the program during that mouth . About six weeks before production day Barry chose a director , Norman Felton , a tall , blond , English-boar expert , who had already handled no fewer than 152 one-hour television plays , mostly for Robert Montgomery . The two men flew up to Vermont early in September to talk with Miss Buck about the changes necessary to make the play suitable for all-live television ( Barry is the son of the ate playwright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made arrangements for Miss Buck to appear in person for two minutes at the end of the show , and talk about her play . Back in New York , staff designers got to work , and the NBC shops began building sets . In mid-September a cast was chosen , and on September 20 Felton and his cast held the first readings , which built to a crescendo of rehearsals as September 30 approached . For one of the last " dry rehearsals , " on a rented stage in the Jewish theater district on Second Avenue , the outline of the sets was marked off in masking tape , and technical staff and actors began to learn exactly where they would stand and what they would do during the show . Usually , the musical director does not start composing the score for the show until after this rehearsal , four clays before performance ; on " The Big Wave , " however , he started early , with the help of a Japanese musician in the orchestra . THE LAST 24 HOURS 0 N THE day before production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge NBC color studios , and the cast went through its paces before the sets while Felton studied on a television screen the appearance of each of the hundred or inure separate shots that would go into the hour-long program . Lighting , camera angles , positions of people and other movables were all checked , changed , changed again , approved , and finalized by means of painted marks on the studio floor . Then , on Sunday at one o'clock , the last , desperate day began . The first step was a check of the color cameras , done by focusing them on the face of a pretty girl named Marlys Johnson , whose skin represents , in the opinion of NBC color technicians , the perfect flesh tone . The actors assembled in costume before the sets ; the four cameramen took their places behind the four heavy cameras which they would wheel around all day ; the four camera control men sat behind individual television screens in thecontrol booth , each watching the picture from one of the cameras . The director and his staff were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing an array of television sets much like the set at home . Since the program was presented in color , there were two sets for each picture ? one color , one blackand-white ; quality must be good on both . The central screens , labeled PROGRAM , showed the picture that would at this point be presented to the viewers . To either side , screens labeled PRESET showed the picture on the camera that would be cued in next . Felton called , " Take ! " and the PRESET picture moved over to PROGRAM , while a new picture appeared on PRESET . In another room , a short walk down a bleak corridor from the studio , Barry and the program 's permanent staff watched the program on two screens ? one color , one black-and-white ? to see how it looked , played , felt . They saw the play four times all told ? twice in run-through , once in dress rehearsal , once for keeps . The first run-through was for technical certainty : Are the cameras correctly placed for composition and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in the time allotted , does the lighting aid or hinder characterization ? During the second run-through everyone paid careful attention to the acting and the lines themselves , the total dramatic impression . Dress rehearsal was the time for the eagle eye , the picking up of the last minor flaws that could be remedied without confusion in the hour 's harried time before broadcast . Then , at nine o'clock , the program went on and nothing more could be done . At ten o'clock the program was over ? and nothing more ever would be done . This is the final fascination of television programing : its utter impermanence . All the strategic thinking , the program development , the production plans , the directing and rehearsing , the sweat of the last two days ? all exist to produce this deliberately ephemeral result . Time rushes past , a new show must be supplied for every hour of it , and within a matter of days nobody but the participants remembers even the best of television programs . If Pearl Buck 's play is especially remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellence but for its role as Weaver 's valedictory . It had all the elements : a Nobel prize winner , the important use of a simple symbol , and the fact that the symbol was a tidal wave .
