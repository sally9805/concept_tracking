For the first time since World War II , Soviet medical scientists last week joined their Western colleagues in discussing the common fight against cancer . At the sixth International Cancer Congress in Sao Paulo , Brazil , 1,000 cancer researchers from 46 other nations listened attentively as Professor Alexander Savittski of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Science reported that 1 ) in the Soviet Union , " 65% of malignant tumors have been cured " ; 2 ) preventive examinations of the entire population over 35 years of age have resulted in " total elimination " of breast and uterine cancer in certain areas . <P> Western scientists found the undocumented Russian claims as hard to accept as Russia 's love of peace on earth . Nor did they cotton to the basic Soviet contentions that cancer cells are made up of special " proteins " not present in normal cells and that a tumor is merely a local " manifestation " of a generalized illness depending primarily on the condition of the central nervous system . Scoffed one observer : " A lovely projection of the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground for the researchers ' ideas was a symposium on cancer control . Conceding that there is a connection between cigarette smoking and cancer , the panel nevertheless put the spotlight on other possible causes-widely used food dyes and additives . Three food dyes have already been generally banned in the West : " Butter yellow " ( used for butter and olive oil ) , " light green SF " ( for green peas ) , and thiourea ( used to prevent oranges from spoiling ) . Last year the U.S. Food and Drug Administration discovered that three of 18 approved synthetic dyes had caused cancer in animals ; 31,000 lbs . of the dangerous dyes had already been consumed by the U.S. public . Warned Britain 's Eric Boyland : " All synthetic food dyes are suspect , and should be investigated before they are used . " <P> More dangerous than smoking are the many particles ( mostly tars ) breathed in by industrialized Western man , declared Dr. Wilhelm Hueper of the U.S. National Cancer Institute . Factory soot , arsenical dust , engine-exhaust fumes all contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. cities , tars were filtered out of the air , and even in tiny doses ( .05 gram ) they were found to cause skin cancer in laboratory mice . <P> New Kind of H-Bomb . Of the many new experimental treatments for cancer described at the congress , the most promising was a " desexed " hormone used by Urologist Charles B. Huggins of the University of Chicago . He reported that he had stripped the hydrogen atom from the sex-hormone molecule , thus ridding it of the power to masculinize or feminize , then administered it to women with advanced breast cancer . The sexless hormones , Huggins hopes , can block the normal female hormones that stimulate breast cancer .
