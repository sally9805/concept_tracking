EXPORTING ENTERPRISE <P> EVER since peacetime foreign aid began , one of its stated objectives has been to promote private free enterprise abroad . But , until a fortnight ago , the promotion of free enterprise got comparatively little public attention . Then outgoing International Cooperation Administrator John Baker Hollister issued a memo to overseas staffers notifying them that henceforth the U.S. " will normally not be prepared to finance publicly owned industrial and extractive enterprises . " Lower-level career people in the State Department promptly planted stories in the metropolitan press accusing Hollister of distorting State Department policy , of trying to cram free enterprise down the throats of foreign governments as the price of getting U.S. aid . Headlines said the State Department had " repudiated " Hollister and that nothing had been changed . <P> **29;11247;TOOLONG <P> Last week it was plain that the headlines were wrong and Hollister was right . A significant new policy has been worked out by the U.S. to back the promotion of free enterprise with dollars . Whereas previous foreign-aid bills only paid lip service to free enterprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a Development Loan Fund for the express purpose of " encouraging competitive free enterprise " abroad . For the first time the U.S. Government is authorized to make loans directly to foreign businessmen . The Administration and such businessmen as Clarence Randall , former chairman of Inland Steel , and Benjamin Fairless , former president of U.S. Steel , plus such business organizations as the Committee for Economic Development and the National Planning Association , fought hard to get the fund established . But the attack on Hollister was a sharp reminder that the fight is far from over . Even harder fighting will be required to make the law effective . Hollister 's successor at the ICA , James Smith , 47 , onetime Pan American World Airways vice president , is well aware of the problems ahead-and the objectives . Said he : " We must undertake to help other countries become of age and attain economic growth . And by help I do not mean giveaways . I mean that same kind of sensible , useful help that you would give to a new enterprise in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort will be sabotaged by the bureaucrats , those who have made a career of emergency-type , government-to-government foreign aid . Not only does the new program pose a sharp threat to the perpetuation of much of foreign aid in its present form ; it calls for a completely new approach . Instead of handing over foreign-aid funds in lump sums to foreign governments to pass out as they wish , it now also becomes necessary to find worthy loan possibilities among private businessmen unable to get credit in their own countries or from U.S. banks . As a starter , the loan fund has $300 million available for this year for loans to promote private business . Applications are expected to total $950 million . Next year Congress has authorized $625 million more . By then applications may total as much as $1.5 billion .
