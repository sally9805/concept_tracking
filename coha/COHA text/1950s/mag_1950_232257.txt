Church unity , in practice , means Protestant unity . Rome 's unbudging stand is still what it always has been : the Roman Catholic Church will welcome the submission of its erring brethren to the authority of its one true faith . That demand for unconditional surrender means that Christianity will remain divided . <P> But of late years , the uniting of all Protestant churches has seemed increasingly possible . Mergers or alliances have already been achieved , e.g. , United Church of Canada , Church of South India . Last week a blueprint for Protestant union appeared in the undenominational Christian Century . Its author : Dr. Charles Clayton Morrison , longtime ( 1908-47 ) editor in chief , now contributing editor . <P> Dr. Morrison 's union of churches would " recognize one another 's ministries and sacraments " and would be organized on four levels . In the local church , no visible major changes would be necessary . " Each local church would determine its own mode of worship and administer baptism and the Lord 's Supper according to its own tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which Morrison calls the " presbytery , " would comprise the churches within each community . The presbytery would ordain ministers recommended by local churches and would appoint delegates to one of twelve or 15 " regional synods . " <P> At the top would be the National Council of the United Church . Its responsibilities probably would include : 1 ) missionary and evangelistic work , 2 ) Christian education , 3 ) training of ministers , 4 ) ministerial pensions , 5 ) public relations , and 6 ) relations with other Christian churches . <P> One of the chief values of his plan for a United Church , Dr. Morrison says , is " that it begins right where the denominations are whose possible participation is envisaged ... It involves no doctrinal problems . . . Instead , it assumes that we are now sufficiently of one heart and one mind to live together in the fellowship of one church , if only we are willing to let the already well-breached walls of our sectarian churchism utterly crumble away .
