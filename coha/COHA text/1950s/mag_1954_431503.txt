 | I have known Barbara Stanwyck all her life . I know her better than anyone else on earth . I knew her when she was a lonely child in Brooklyn ; I helped her through the dangerous . exciting months when she was getting started in the theatre . I 've stood by through every one of her 73 motion pictures , and I 've seen the gray creep into that flaming auburn hair . It 's been fun to watch a whole generation of movie-goers grow up while she was scoring dramatic success after dramatic success ; to sense that she was just as forceful in her latest movie . Executive Suite , as she was six years ago in the suspenseful Sorry , Wrong Number . Through the upsurging , hectic years of her fame , we have not lost sight of each other . I ate dinner alone with her last night in her Beverly Hills home . Sometimes when she has had to play a character she can not easily understand , it has been I who explained the character to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things she knows . If she really is the actress Hollywood insists she is , it is I who have made her so . And yet she has never given a dinner party in my honor . She has never said in public that I am responsible for her success . To be candid , she has never once introduced me to any of the celebrities who are her friends . But I know them well , for she and I discuss them together after the parties are over . It is not that she is ashamed of me ; I 'm quite sure of that . I think she believes her friends would not be interested in me . And perhaps they would not be . For I am a simple woman , born far from the " glamour " that is their present world . I am shy , in fact . But I am also bold and audacious . I 'm Irish , and I know I have a good sense of humor . Amusing descriptions of people and of dignified goings on often pop into my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can Barbara . My sense of humor has saved her many a time . I think the lowest moment of her whole life was when she came back to her empty house after she had been divorced from Robert Taylor . She loved that man . She also believed in him completely . Eleven and a half years of what felt like happiness with him had given her the idea that it was going on forever . Nothing else had , in her life of quick change . But this felt like forever , and she wanted it that way . So the divorce was a terrific blow to her . Not just one blow , either , but a blow to every phase of her ? to her love , first of all , and to her trust in the goodness of living ; to her faith in herself as a lovable woman . And also , no less painful , it was a blow to her pride and the fragile dignity that is a necessity for a woman married to a man slightly younger than herself . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her big empty house , she had hit bedrock . Suddenly I saw her standing in the entrance hall , looking as if she were n't going to make it . She had been so overwhelmed by so much during those weeks that she had forgotten I was there . So I called out to her . I said , " Hiya , kid ! Anyone here for solitaire ? " It might have been a cruel thing to say to some women . But I knew her . I thought it might make her smile ; deep-down inside . where she does her living . So I said it . It was a joke between the two of us . It helped save the day . @# I 've saved other days for her , especially the hard ones . And there have been plenty of those . She made that long journey some call the American dream . Some people think a spectacular rise from rags to riches is prett corny . But other people declare it is what has made America great : the opportunity any youngster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the best-loved Americans have made that trip . From the outside it seems exciting and wonderful , and you 'd think all the people who made it would be tickled to pieces with themselves . But I expect that for every one of those who enjoy it , there is somebody like me who knows exactly what the achievement has cost . @# Sure anybody can do it ? anybody who can be ruthless with himself , who does n't spare himself the last horrible effort when all but one part of him is crying out to give up . Anybody can do it , maybe , provided he is obsessed with an idea that never lets him slow up and take life easy the way average people do . You 've got to love success ? or rather you 've got to love the thing you 're trying to give to the world more than you love your comfort . You 've got to be dissatisfied with everything but the best you 're capable of doing . The irony of it is that the world showers back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would please you is always just beyond your touch . For the people who get to the top are the ones who are never satisfied . I began coming to Barbara 's rescue years ago , when she was still a youngster . What always embarrasses both Barbara and me is that the facts of her childhood are more corny than a ballad . So I 'll say it right out . She was an orphan . Her mother died when she was two , and her father felt so bad about the whole thing that he just wandered off and left his children . She had an older sister , Mildred , who made up her mind that no matter what happened her baby sister was n't ever going to be put into  | an orphans ' home . Mildred kept her boarding around with families in the neighborhood , thinking it would be fine for the child to live in a family . But Mildred could n't see that a child who pays board never quite belongs to the family . I saw it . I made jokes about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Barbara was six and beginning to understand , I tried to buck up her courage . She 'd say to me , " I 'm an orphan . I 'll always be just an orphan . " And I 'd say right back , " Cats and dogs are orphans . and who has more fun ? kids or cats ? " She got through that period finally . By the time she was eleven , she looked fourteen . Seemed she just wanted to grow up extra-fast so she could find a life of her own . She was always trying to make somebody think she was old enough to have a job . But she worked herself out of a job , as fast as she worked herself in . Her trouble was that she was too honest and outspoken . Once she had a job selling dress patterns . She took it so seriously that she often gave her customers advice . Sometimes that was good . But once it was bad . She told a stout woman the pattern she had chosen would make her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her bright dream was of becoming a dancer . She had n't a chance of affording ( lancing lessons , but she was clever about teaching herself . She ran her skinny legs off doing errands until she got enough money for a ticket to a vaudeville show . Then she practiced what she had seen . Even then she had a deep , husky voice . the kind that makes you think of fog and night . When she sang . people stopped to listen , because she sang low , as if she knew a secret . People listen to that kind of singing . Once in a while she got a chance to sing or dance in a dingy night club . She was about fifteen by now . She lived with two other girls in a cold-water room in the Forties in New York . They were all for one and one for all . When none of them had a job , they went to a kindhearted restaurant owner who let them " charge " meals . He was Billy 1 , aHiff. and The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was patronized by all kinds of people who loved good food . Billy knew them all . and he had great respect for talent . That 's how I explain the good deed he did for me . But maybe the real explanation was that I owed him quite a lot of money . Anyway he gave me my first break . I was in The Tavern one night , eating on credit . Billy said , " Ruby , I 've got a chance for you . " He took me over to Willard Mack , who had a table by himself . Mr. Mack was a director of legitimate plays . He was more famous than anyone I 'd ever met. up to that moment . When I 'm frightened . even now , I try to act bold . I was really scared then . So I looked at Willard Mack with impudent assurance , just to keep from turning around and running away . Billy said , " Mr. Mack , you said one of your characters in the new play is a chorus girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They talked it over as if I was n't present , and finally Mr. Mack said , " All right , Ruby . I 'll give you a try . " Guess what I said ? I said , " Mr. Mack , I live with two other girls . We all need jobs . All of us , or nobody . " Billy looked horrified , and Mr. Mack looked furious . Then he burst out laughing . " So you wo n't walk out on your friends ? " he said . " Well , you 're quite a girl , Ruby . " So he gave us all jobs . That play was The Noose . The first tryout out of town was a bleak fiasco . So Willard Mack rewrote the play . He decided a chorus girl should be the heroine . And that 's how Barbara Stanwyck got her first big chance . " From then on it was easy " ? that 's what the rags-toriches scripts usually say . But it was n't for Barbara . Mr.  | Mack coached her every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of working with her . In fact he made her learn a new part every week , just for practice . One amusing thing happened when The Noose got to New York . I sent wires inviting all kinds of people from our neighborhood to come and see the success . Tickets were waiting for them at the box office . I did n't come on stage until the second act . Then I saw all the empty seats in the front row , which I had paid for . I felt utterly forlorn and friendless . It was n't until later that I found out what had happened . My friends came all right , and picked up their tickets . But when they did n't see my name , Ruby Stevens , on the program , they thought they must have blundered into the wrong theatre and got tickets meant for someone else . They left before the management came down to toss ' em out ! The Noose ran for 197 performances , and during that time Barbara worked tirelessly . Theatre became the breath of life to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her next play was Burlesque , and that too was successful . Barbara , really too young for success , lived up to the role , off stage and on . Her gruff shyness set the fashion that year , for nobody suspected that the reason she did n't condescend to talk much was not haughtiness but uncertainty . She knew perfectly well that if she opened her mouth too wide , the orphan from Brooklyn would pop out . One day somebody brought Frank Fay , the topflight vaudeville favorite , to her dressing room . They looked at each other , and that was that . Love at first sight . Barbara @# wanted to make some big sacrifice for Frank . So she gave up the thing she loved most , acting . Frank Fay had a contract with Warner 's , and as soon as they were married they went to Hollywood . I went too , but nobody paid any attention to me . I was kept out of sight . Mrs. Frank Fay was busy learning social graces . So I just waited . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would find me eventually ? when she got through being ashamed of her childhood . The Fays got a large house , and it looked as if this were the happy ending . Now Barbara had a family at last , and neighbors , and an adopted son , and this was heaven . It would have been , probably , except for one important fact . Barbara Stanwyck was an actress . Theatre was her lifeblood , and the only time she felt really alive was when she was acting some character not one bit like herself . She tried to hide this , but it finally broke through . Joseph Schenck had seen her act on Broadway and had said , " If you ever want a movie part , just telephone me . " So one day she did . And that was the beginning of her 73 motion pictures . It was the beginning of those ? and gradually it was the end of her marriage . They say a lot of things about Barbara in Hollywood . They call her a " director 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once been late on a set . But she does n't think that 's anything remarkable , for acting is her work . The least you can do is to get there on time . They say she has always helped youngsters who have talent , that she has infinite patience when a motion picture is " being brought in . " She learns every part in every picture she plays in , because she believes that helps her play her own part better . But all these things seem to her just what anybody ought to expect of a star . The play 's the thing , and if you 're really an actress you do n't let yourself stand in its way . In Hollywood they call her the Queen . It 's a custom there , when a picture is completed , for the star to give a gift to everyone in the cast , and to the grips and the light men and the whole army of people who are responsible for what you see on the screen . Often these coworkers have turned the tables on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , minutely engraved with the words " To Our Queen Bee , from her drones . " Barbara 's hair is frankly silver , and people keep telling her it is even more becoming now than when it was auburn . It photographs as an aureole , and her face does n't seem to have changed much through the years . There are many legends in Hollywood . The legend called Barbara Stanwyck always @#  | amuses me . It is nicely built up , and lots of people love and respect it . But in addition to all that , there is much below the surface that nobody but me ever sees . There 's her great desire to write something helpful . " Seems to me , anybody who 's traveled the long way I 've come ought to have something useful to say . " And there 's the business about money . She 's afraid of it . She has to pay every bill the minute it 's in the house . She wo n't buy anything at all until she knows all previous bills are paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money under control . Once she saved a long , long time to buy a mink . That was silly , was n't it ? She never can believe she can have all she wants . I understand that , for I remember when she had only one pair of stockings at a time . I remember very well . Barbara is a great reader . It 's in the nature of a disease , maybe . She reads more than a dozen books a month . She ca n't get enough of them . I know why . No matter what she knows , she 'll never feel she has made up for the education she could n't have when she was a youngster . Besides her serious reading , she devours mystery stories . Murder mysteries . The roles she has enjoyed most were involved in murder . And that does n't surprise me . I know why she 's interested in murder . It is because she tried to murder me ! Me , Ruby Stevens . It began the first night she played the lead , out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came off the stage at the end of the play , while the applause was still washing against the curtain . The whole cast was huddled together , too excited to believe we were a success . NIr . Mack looked over and grinned at me . " Ruby , you were great , " he said . " But Ruby Stevens is no name for a star . " His eye whipped around the walls of the green room where old bills were hanging . One said , " Jane Stanwyck in Barbara Fritchie . " Mr. Mack came over and bowed to me . " Good evening , Barbara Stanwyck , " he said . The murder was n't completed at that moment , of course . It was a long , slow attempt to do away with me . Barbara Stanwyck wanted to kill every trace of Ruby Stevens . For some years it looked as if she had succeeded . But the secret person who dwells within each of us , whom nobody ever sees or really knows , can not easily be killed . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person and the inner one have finally found peace . When that communion has been established , according to the psychologists , there is maturity . So flow you must expect greater roles from Stanwyck . I do .
