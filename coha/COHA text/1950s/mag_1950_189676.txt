For the past three years , more &; more Britons have been listening with rapt attention to a BBC program called Bird Song of the Month . Even non-bird-lovers have been won by the personality of the show 's M.C. , excitable , 68-year-old Dr. Ludwig Koch . Says Producer Desmond Hawkins : " The charm about Ludwig is that he is one of the few fanatics left . " <P> Last week , Fanatic Koch propounded an interesting ornithological theory : that chaffinches have different accents in different parts of the world . Playing the song of a British chaffinch , German-accented Dr. Koch said : " Ant now , as you vill see by my next record , zee German chaffinch , unlike zee Kent chaffinch , finishes op viz a sound like ' wurz debur . ' " Sure enough , it did . <P> Despite the loss of a 6,000-record library when he fled Germany in 1936 , Dr. Koch has today one of the world 's greatest collections of bird and animal recordings . Muffled in an old tweed coat , he carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plain , " creeping like a criminal , " he says , to capture the call of the grass warbler . Badgered by such background noises as airplanes , trains , barking dogs and high winds , he has triumphantly recorded the moorland cry of the greenshank and the " singing " of the seal on the spray-splashed rocks off the Pembrokeshire coast . He is postponing his retirement at least until he can get on wax the elusive stone curlew and the long-tailed tit . <P> For good reason , he loves his adopted England . " In England , " he explains happily , " it is everyzing for zee birds and animals . It is amazing how zey understand how important it is. "
