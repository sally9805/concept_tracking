The half block between the Gettysburg Hotel and the old gymnasium , which had been converted into an auditorium , was lined with people-women in shorts , men with straw hats , kids with sunburned faces . Between them , smiling to their applause , moved the President of the U.S. , on his way to the auditorium for his weekly press conference . Uppermost in Ike 's mind : the forthcoming visit to the U.S. of Russia 's Nikita Khrushchev . Said the President to the 95 newsmen at the press conference : " I would hope for a bettering of the atmosphere between the East and the West ... I am trying to do my best to see whether we ca n't bring about a somewhat better situation in the relations between the two , and maybe he can learn a little bit more about our country , as certainly I can about his . " <P> President Eisenhower was asked what he particularly wanted Khrushchev to see in the U.S. The answer gave insight into Ike himself . Items : <P> " I would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fairless plant , and see this town universally and exclusively inhabited by its workmen , and to see what those homes are . <P> " I would like to see him have to fly along in my chopper and just make a circuit of the District of Columbia , and to see the uncountable homes that have been built all around , modest but decent , fine comfortable homes . <P> " I would like to see him go into our great farmland and see our farmers , each one operating on his own , not regimented . <P> <P> " I would like to see him go in the little town where I was reared Abilene , Kans. and pick up the evidence-and of course there are some still alive who remember when I was there , you know-and let them tell him the story of how hard I worked . . . He said in one of his conversations to Mr. Nixon : ' What do you know about work ? You never worked . ' Well , I can show him the evidence that I did . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what we are doing . I want him to see a happy people . I want him to see a free people , doing exactly as they choose , within the limits that they must not transgress the rights of others ... I am just telling you what I-the kind of thing I would like to have him see of America . "
