At Eighth Army headquarters in Korea this week , Army Chief of Staff J. Lawton ( " Lightning Joe " ) Collins put an end to speculation over whether the U.S. would fight on in Korea or get out . The U.S. , said General Collins firmly , would " stay and fight . " He added that replacements were already flowing to divisions depleted in recent Communist offensives , and that new units , including one new Army division , would go out " in two or three months . " No men would be shipped to Korea without their full four months of basic training . <P> Of several reasons for staying in Korea , perhaps the best was the pinning down of many of Red China 's best troops , which would otherwise be free for aggression elsewhere ( for example , in Indo-China ) . <P> General Collins ' announcement followed the arrival in Tokyo of a bevy of top Washington brass for secret powwows with Douglas Mac Arthur . Besides Collins , the visitors included Air Force Chief of Staff Hoyt Vandenberg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Intelligence Alexander Boiling . Guesses flew thick &; fast around the Dai Ichi building , ranging even to the surmise that Nationalist China 's armies on Formosa might be brought to bear against Mao Tse-tung 's hordes . <P> In Korea , the Eighth Army 's Matt Ridgway said to Joe Collins : " There is no shadow of doubt that the Eighth Army can take care of itself . " The pattern of last week 's fighting ( see below ) made General Ridgway 's assertion look better than it would have looked the week before .
