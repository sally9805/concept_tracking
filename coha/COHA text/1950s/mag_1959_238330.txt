When myxomatosis was accidentally imported* into England in 1953 , the homeland of Flopsy , Mopsy and Cottontail was horrified . Every rabbit from Penzance to the Orkneys , it seemed , was dying or dead . Stricken animals with grotesquely swollen heads hobbled aimlessly on highways , and carcasses lay stinking in ditches . <P> The London Times was swamped with letters from outraged bunny lovers . Some of the loudest objectors were fox hunters . In the absence of their preferred prey , ravenous British foxes turned to moles , rats , blackberries and garbage cans . They lost the stamina they used to build up chasing rabbits , no longer led hunters off on the long , steady chases of old . Instead , they developed a tendency to head for the nearest suburb , leaving hunters embarrassedly clattering through backyards and garbage dumps . Another curious side effect : British buzzards , deprived of protein once obtained from rabbit carrion , suffered loss of fertility . <P> But many Britons have come to realize that they are better off without the rabbits , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vegetation has rioted and farmers ' incomes have risen . Oak saplings have taken hold where they had no chance for centuries , and for the first time in memory , wild roses are blossoming over chalk cliffs . <P> The present number of the animals is comfortably low . But the survivors are multiplying like rabbits , and their offspring are apt to be resistant to myxomatosis . Forgetting their sentimental attachment to the rabbits of child literature , platoons of Englishmen , organized in 200 government-approved rabbit-clearance societies , are now using nets , cyanide , traps and shotguns to maintain the status quo . <P> <P> * Originally a South American infection , the virus of myxomatosis was first used in 1950 to cut down the Australian rabbit population . In 1952 a French pediatrician-out to get the pests who had been nibbling on his estate-imported cultures , inoculated two wild rabbits , started an epidemic that spread rapidly through Europe and Great Britain .
