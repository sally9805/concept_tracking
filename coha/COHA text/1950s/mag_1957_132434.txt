DONALD CAMPBELL , holder of the world 's speedboat record of 225.63 mph , asks // GUY LOMBARDO Freeport , N.Y . Boat owner and driver He 's right . The drivers in cup races have n't reached this water barrier for two main reasons . First , it requires a straight run of about eight miles to get to top speed . Second , as boats approach this barrier , they vibrate and shudder as an airplane does when it nears the sound barrier . // RUBY SCULL Ventnor , N.J. Driver It 's true that the speed of a racing boat is limited , but that 's only because the propellers do not work efficiently at very high speeds . The fastest propeller-driven boat went 178 mph , not nearly as fast as Campbell 's jet-driven boat . But with redesigned propellers , we perhaps can reach 300 mph. // RON MUSSON Akron Driver and owner I disagree most emphatically . In 1949 the speed record was 141 mph . Today it 's much higher . Our best boat designers are presently working on hulls that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'll soon succeed in giving us boats that will consistently break 225 mph. // GEORGE J. TRIMPER Buffalo , N.Y . Past president APBA As of the moment , I agree . But this theoretical barrier can be consistently broken when we design boats that will hold together under the rough poundings at these high speeds . These boats will have to be strong enough to pass the barrier twice , breaking through and slowing down . // JOE VAN BLERCK Freeport , N.Y . Ex 7-Liter champion He is wrong . There must be a water barrier somewhere , but it is much higher than 225 mph . Campbell is judging by the vibrations he feels at high speeds . However , once a boat breaks through the actual barrier , there should be no vibration at all . The boat would be ahead of the shock waves . // DANNY FOSTER Detroit Racing driver Campbell is right-There is a definite barrier . I 've driven about 190 mph , and I 'm sure I can go faster . How much faster is questionable . At that speed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The danger lies in plowing into a wave at that speed . Water is like a brick wall at 200 mph. // BILL MUNCEY Seattle Winner , Gold Cup , ' 56 , ' 57 in Miss Thriftway Miss Thriftway is capable of speeds approaching Campbell 's theoretical speed barrier . We have n't exceeded it because the course is not long enough . However , with a boat properly designed and in proper trim , speeds approaching 300 or 400 are possible . // LEE SCHOENITH Detroit Driver , Gale VI I do n't think a water barrier exists at all . The size of the power plant and the design and size of the hull will give you the ultimate in speed . However , a large enough body of water and the right weather are essential in order to run a boat 500 or 600 miles per hour . // FRANK FOULKE Essex , Md . Chairman Inboard Racing Commission , APBA I disagree . Sure , Cobb and Verga were killed while trying to reach this so-called barrier . but rough water or waves kicked up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like any other speed sport . Each year speeds are higher as designs are improved .
