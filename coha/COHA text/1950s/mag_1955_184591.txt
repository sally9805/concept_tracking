Dave Beck , the ruddy-faced president of the A.F.L. Teamster Union , could easily be mistaken for a millionaire . Teamster Beck has several personal business interests on the side : he owns large chunks of Seattle real estate ; he is board chairman of Kellerblock Corp. , which owns Seattle 's 18-story Grosvenor House apartments , and , until recently , he operated Northwest Securities Corp. , an auto finance company . His family has interests in other enterprises , including beer and beverage distributorships . Last week it appeared that Beck put over one of his best business deals at the union 's expense . <P> Plus Periodic Rest . From the Teamsters President Beck gets the same salary as doddering President Emeritus Dan Tobin , who retired in 1952 : $50,000 a year. * He also gets some plain and fancy fringe benefits , including the right to travel at union expense anywhere in the world with his family and aides for " periodic rests " -a privilege specifically written into the Teamsters ' constitution . <P> Recently , Teamster officials decided that their boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Tobin , for whom the union provides homes in Miami and New England , along with servants and upkeep . Last March 10 , while Beck discreetly absented himself from the room , the union executive board unanimously voted to supply him with a " home and operating help . " It turned out that Beck , always a good businessman , did even better than Tobin . He sold his own house to the union for $163,215 , pocketed the money and went right on living there , free . <P> Plus a Waterfall . Last week , when the story of his latest and flashiest fringe benefit broke , Beck bellowed like a bull caught in the barn door . " I had nothing to do with the purchase , " he said . " When they wanted to give me a home , I wanted nothing less than what I was living in already . They said , ' Go ahead and buy it . We do n't care what it costs .
