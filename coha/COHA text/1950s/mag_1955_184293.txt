BILLY GRAHAM V. CHICO VEJAR read the signs in Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden ( see SPORT ) . But the big event one night last week was the old battle of the Rev. Billy Graham v. the Devil . Evangelist Graham drew a laugh from a capacity crowd ( 22,000 ) by telling how a little boy in the audience had been disappointed when Billy turned out not to be his prize fighter namesake . Then , for the first time at a major meeting in New York , he moved in on the sinners of the big town . <P> " For the first time in the history of America , we are fighting with our backs to the wall , " he thundered . " We are feeling fear . We 're all worried about the hydrogen bomb . " When such an attack does come , " the first target is New York City ! " The New Yorkers - middleaged , mostly female and intensely quiet - shifted uneasily . They had come to hear Billy celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and they had filled the Garden well before the meeting began . In the street outside , another crowd of several thousand listened via loudspeakers , while 120 police and plainclothesmen coped with clogged traffic and pickpockets . In the corridors around the arena , the refreshment stands kept their beer and cigarettes out of the way , sold only coffee , soft drinks and hot dogs . <P> " New York , like any other city , needs a religious revival , " cried Billy , his long hands molding the air , his hawklike , handsome face twisted with intensity . He has always fought shy of launching one of his full-dress crusades against New York 's hard core of sin , but he evidently would like to try . As he spoke to the thousand-odd who answered his " invitation " to give themselves to Christ , Billy suggested how wonderful it would be if , some time in the future , they could do the same every night for three months . " But whether we come is not material , " he added . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important .
