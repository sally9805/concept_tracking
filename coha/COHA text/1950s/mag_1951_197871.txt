Bees , by &; large , lead sad lives . Most young queens are killed by the reigning queen before they reach maturity . All the mature drones ( males ) are killed or starved by the workers ( sterile females ) before winter comes . Most drones die celibate ; only one in thousands manages to mate with a virgin queen-and then pays with his life when she tears his genitals away . <P> The females work themselves to death , wearing their wings to rags on trips to &; from flowers . The only pleasure they seem to get is when , as young adults , they care for the baby bees , nursing them tenderly and feeding them golden pollen . <P> Now it looks as if bee scientists have learned to deprive them of even these few tender hours . In Britain 's Journal of Experimental Biology , C. R. Ribbands of the Bee Research Department , Rothamsted Experimental Station , tells how he and colleagues anesthetized worker bees by putting them in jars of carbon dioxide or nitrogen . The bees soon recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been tending the baby bees forsook their charges and started gathering nectar , to be stored up in the combs and made into honey. * Older workers , that had been gathering both nectar and pollen ( for baby bees ) , usually gathered nothing but nectar thenceforth . The gassing caused both age groups to ignore the colony 's system of cooperative reproduction . Only one emotion remained : greed for more &; more nectar . <P> Beeman Ribbands is well pleased with his discovery . In some localities , he says , bees pay altogether too much attention to raising their young , and produce too many of them . He thinks that if whole colonies are doused with carbon dioxide , they will stick more strictly to business , gather more nectar , lay up a bigger crop of profit-making honey . <P> <P> *Nectar is a dilute solution of various sugars .
