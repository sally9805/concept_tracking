txt WASHINGTON , March 2 ? Western diplomats found little in the latest Soviet notes on the German problem to encourage hope for any easy , quick solution . The only encouragement they could find in their first reading of the long messages to the United States , Britain and France was that the Russians had kept the door open to negotiations . Diplomatic sources here indicated that the Western Allies almost certainly would reject the proposal for the kind ofl foreign ministers conference Moscow advanced today . It was assumed that rejection would be accompanied by a new Western counter-proposal . While the French reaction was similarly pessimistic , some preliminary optimism was voiced itt London and Bonn . ? Two Basic Objections Diplomats in Washington found two fundamental objections to the Soviet position : First , they ' noted , the Russians have indicated a willingness to discuss only those problems they deem important : snaking West Berlin a demilitarized free city and arranging a peace treaty with a divided Germany . Second , Moscow wants to add two Communist ' states , Poland and Czechoslovakia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position is that only nations with an internaItionally recognized " special interest " in Germany  --  the Soviet ) Union , Britain , " France and the ! United States ? should make basic decisions on the country , 1 with the advice of the Germans , both Communist and non-Corn-1 munist . Defect in Larger Parley Western counter-proposals can be expected to concentrate on these points . The Western Allies can be expected to maintain that if they are willing to discuss problems raised by the So- ' viet Union , the latter can not expect to rule out matters they consider important . On the question of partidipaton , experts here doubted the West would rule out the presence of other states . It would argue , however , that expansion of the conference should not be confined to Communist countries and that to include all nations with an interest in Germany would make it unwieldy and unnecessarily complicated .

While diplomats studied the note , Congress was being reassured by Defense Secretary Neil , H. that the United States was , ready to stand firm on Berlin . " We are prepared to meet various stages of the Berlin situation as it ? develops , " he told the House Space Committee . " We are prepared to make good on the statement of the President that we will not yield one inch on our rights in Berlin . " The defense chief said he did not think the Russians wanted to start a war . He also said there was no plan now ' to mobilize because of the German crisis . There was a sharp division of opinion- among diplomats here on whether the Russians intended to . go ahead with their plan to hand over Berlin occupation rights , to the East German Communist regime on May 27 , and to make a peace treaty with it .

The Soviet Ambassador in Berlin , Mikhail G. Pervukhin , met with Eost.German leaders yesterday . Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko delivered a message in Moscow today to : the East German envoy , Johannes Koenig . Premier ' Khrusheller will go to East Germany Wednesday , ostensibly to . attend the ' Leipzig Fair . The Soviet notes prompted some persons , including a few influential Congressmen , to use the word " thaw " to describe Moscow 's position . Most of them had not read the Soviet message but had heard that Mos cow accepted some kind of foreign ministers ' meeting . Many Soviet experts disagreed emphatically with talk of a " thaw . " They noted that Mr. Khrushchev had not closed the door to a foreign ministers ' gathering but had merely said it was " a waste of That Soviet attitude remains unChanged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
