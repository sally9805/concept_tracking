or leaning on a bar with a schooner of beer talking baseball or telling the boys about the big German Brown somebody brought in in a cake of ice . We have n't any elk or German Browns right now , but we 've got some nice ducks , a fine display along five feet of counter . And who brought them in ? The student , the alien son . It must gravel you . He drew himself a beer . Several other men had come in , and he saw three more stooping to look in the door beyond Sciutti 's . Then they too came in . Three tables were going ; his father had started to hustle , filling orders . After a few minutes Schmeckebier and Navy went into the card room with four men . The poolroom lights were up bright again , there was an ivory click of balls , a rumble of talk . The smoke-filled air was full of movement . Still more people dropped in , kids in high school athletic sweaters and bums from the fringes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducks , and Henry saw glances at his waders , heard questions and answers . John Lederer 's boy . Some of them spoke to him , deriving importance from contact with him . A fellowship was promoted by the ducks strung out along the counter . Henry felt it himself . He was so mellowed by the way they spoke to him that when the players at the first table thumped with their cues , he got off his stool to rack them up and collect their nickels . It occurred to him that he ought to go to the room and get into a bath , but he did n't want to leave yet . Instead he came back to the counter and slid the nickels toward his father and drew himself another beer . " Pretty good night tonight , " he said . The old man nodded and slapped his rag on the counter , his eyes already past Henry and fixed on two youths coming in , his mouth fixing itself for the greeting and the " Well , boys , what 'll it be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . " Well , time for my nightly wrestle with temptation , " he said . " I was just going to challenge you to a game of call-shot . " " Maybe tomorrow , " Billy said , and let himself out carefully as if afraid a noise would disturb someone  --  a mild , gentle , golden-haired boy who looked as if he ought to be in some prep school learning to say " Sir " to grownups instead of clerking in a girlie hotel . He was the only one of the poolroom crowdthat Henry half liked . He thought he understood Billy Hammond a little . He turned back to the counter to hear his father talking with Max Schmeckebier . " I do n't see how we could on this rig . That 's the hell of it , we need a regular oven . " " In my room in back , " Schmeckebier said . " Dot old electric range . " " Does it work ? " " Sure . Vy not ? I tink so . " " By God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to give us a real old-fashioned feed . " He mopped the counter , refilled a coffee cup , came back to the end and pinched the breast of a duck , pulled out a wing and looked at the band of blue hidden among the drab feathers . " Just like old times , for a change , " he said , and his eyes touched Henry 's in a look that might have meant anything from a challenge to an apology . Henry had no desire to ease the strain that had been between them for months . He did not forgive his father the poolhall , or forget the way the old man had sprung back into the old pattern , as if his wife had been a jailer and he was now released . He neither forgot nor forgave the red-haired woman who sometimes came to the poolhall late at night and waited on a bar stool while the old man closed up . Yet now when his father remarked that the ducks ought to be drawn and plucked right away , Henry stood up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " his father said . The blood spread hotter in Henry 's face , but he bit off what he might have said . " All right , " he said . " You do them and I 'll take over the counter for you . " So here he was , in the poolhall he had passionately sworn he would never do a lick of work in , dispensing Mrs. Morrison 's meat pies and tamales smothered in chile , clumping behind the counter in the waders which had been the sign of his temporary freedom . Leaning back between orders , watching the Saturday night activity of the place , he half understood why he had gone hunting , and why it had seemed to him essential that he bring his trophies back here . That somewhat disconcerted understanding was still troubling him when his father came back , The old man had put on a clean apron and brushed his hair . His pouched eyes , brighter and less houndlike than usual , darted along the bar , counting , and darted across the bright tables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both half smiled . Both of them , Henry thought , were a little astonished . 1 AATER , propped in bed in the hotel room , he put down the magazine he had been reading and stared at the drawn blinds , the sleazy drapes , and asked himself why he was here . The story he had told others , and himself , that his mother 's death had interrupted his school term and he was waiting for the new term before going back , he knew to be an evasion . He was staying because he could n't get away , or would n't . He hated his father , hated the poolhall , hated the people he was thrown with . He made no move to hobnob with them , or had n't until tonight , and yet he deliberately avoided seeing any of the people who had been his friends for years . Why ? He could force his mind to the barrier , but not across it . Within a half minute he found himself reading again , diving deep , and when he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time at his father 's bed , his father 's shoes under the bed , his father 's soiled shirts hanging in the open closet . All the home he had any more was this little room . He could not pretend that as long as he stayed here the fragments of his home and family were held together . He could n't fool himself that he had any function in his father 's life any more , or his father in his , unless his own hatred and his father 's uneasy suspicion were functions . He ought to get out and get a job until he could go back to school . But he did n't . Thinking made him sleepy , and he knew what that was , too . Sleep was another evasion , like the torpor and monotony of his life . But he let drowsiness drift over him , and drowsily he thought of his father behind the counter tonight , vigorous and jovial , Mine Host , and he saw that the usual fretful petulance had gone from his face . He snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . Then he heard the rain , the swish and hiss of traffic in the wet street . He felt sad and alone , and he disliked the coldness of his own isolation . Again he thought of his father , of the failing body that had once been tireless and bull-strong , of the face before it had sagged and grown dewlaps of flesh on the square jaws . He thought of the many failures , the jobs that never quite worked out , the schemes that never quite paid off , and of the eyes that could not quite meet , not quite hold , the eyes of his cold son . Thinking of this , and remembering when they had been a family and when his mother had been alive to hold them together , he felt pity , and he cried . His father 's entrance awakened him . He heard the fumbling at the door , the creak , the quiet click , the footsteps that groped in darkness , the body that bumped into something and halted , getting its bearings . He heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other bed , his father 's sighing breath as he bent to untie his shoes . Feigning sleep , he lay unmoving , breathing deeply and steadily , but an anguish of fury had leaped in him as sharp and sudden as a sudden fear , for he smelled the smells his father brought with him : wet wool , stale tobacco , liquor ; and above all , more penetrating than any , spreading through the room and polluting everything there , the echo of cheap musky perfume . The control Henry imposed upon his body was like an ecstasy . He raged at himself for the weak sympathy that had troubled him all evening . One good night , he said to himself now , staring furiously upward . One lively Saturday night in the joint and he ca n't contain himself , he has to go top off the evening with his girl friend . And how ? A drink in her room ? A walk over to some illegal after-hours bar on Rum Alley ? Maybe just a trip to bed , blunt and immediate ? His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his orderly breathing went in and out , in and out , while the old man sighed into bed and creaked a little , rolling over , and lay still . The taint of perfume seemed even stronger now . The sow must slop it on by the cupful . And so cuddly . Such a sugar baby . How 's my old sweetie tonight ? It 's been too long since you came to see your baby . I should be real mad at you . The cheek against the lapel , the unreal hair against the collar , the perfume like some gaseous poison tainting the clothes it touched . The picture of his mother 's bureau drawers came to him , the careless simple collection of handkerchiefs and gloves and lace collars and cuffs , and he saw the dusty blue sachet packets The Blue-Winged Teal A Story by Wallace Stegner S TILL in waders , with the string of ducks across his shoulder , he stood hesitating on the sidewalk in the cold November wind . His knees were stiff from being cramped up all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , all day , he had been alive ; now he was back ready to be dead again . Lights were on all up and down the street , and there was a rush of traffic and a hurrying of people past and around him , yet the town was not his town , the people passing were strangers , the sounds of evening in this place were no sounds that carried warmth or familiarity . Though he had spent most of his twenty years in the town , knew hundreds of its people , could draw maps of its streets from memory , he wanted to admit familiarity with none of it . He had shut himself off . Then what was he doing here , in front of this poolhall , loaded down with nine dead ducks ? What had possessed him in the first place to borrow gun and waders and car from his father and go hunting ? If he had wanted to breathe freely for a change , why had n't he kept right on going ? What was there in this place to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring his meat to and people who would be glad of his skill . He had this poolhall and his father , John Lederer , Prop . He stepped out of a woman 's path and leaned against the door . Downstairs , in addition to his father , he would find old Max Schmeckebier , who ran a cheap blackjack game in the room under the sidewalk . He would find Giuseppe Sciutti , the Sicilian bar- bet closing his shop or tidying up the rack of Artists and Models and The Nudist with which he lured trade . He would probably find Billy Hammond , the night clerk from the Windsor Hotel , having his sandwich and beer and pie , or moving alone around a pool table , whistling abstractedly , practicing shots . If the afternoon blackjack game had broken up , there would be Navy Edwards , dealer and bouncer for Schmeckebier . At this time of evening there might be a few counter customers and a cop collecting his tribute of a beer or that other tribute that Schmeckebier paid to keep the cardroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bright sky and the wind of the tule marshes , the cavelike room with its back corners in darkness , would smell that smell compounded of steam heat and cue-chalk dust , of sodden butts in cuspidors , of coffee and meat and beer smells from the counter , of cigarette smoke so unaired that it darkened the walls . From anywhere back of the middle tables there would be the pervasive reek of toilet disinfectant . Back of the lunch counter his father would be presiding , throwing the poolhall light switch to save a few cents when the place was empty , flipping it on to give an air of brilliant and successful use when feet came down the stairs past Sciutti 's shop . The hunter moved his shoulder under the weight of the ducks , his mind full for a moment with the image of his father 's face , darkly-pale , fallen in on its bones , and the pouched , restless , suspicious eyes that seemed always looking for someone . Over that image came the face of his mother , dead now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how she had held the old man up for thirty years , kept him at a respectable job , kept him from slipping back into the poolroom-Johnny he had been when she married him . Within ten days of her death he had hunted up this old failure of a poolhall . In anger the hunter turned , thinking of the hotel room he shared with his father . But he had to eat . Broke as he was , a student yanked from his studies , he had no choice but to eat on the old man . Besides , there were the ducks . He felt somehow that the thing would be incomplete unless he brought his game back for his father to see . His knees unwilling in the stiff waders , he went down the steps , descending into the light shining through Joe Sciutti 's door , and into the momentary layer of clean bay rum smell , talcum smell , hair tonic smell , that rose past the still-revolving barber pole in the angle of the stairs . of Sciutti was sweeping wads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter beyond , their backs to the door , were Schmeckebier , Navy Edwards , Billy Hammond , and an unknown customer . John Lederer was behind the counter , mopping alertly with a rag . The poolroom lights were up bright , but when Lederer saw who was coming he flipped the switch and dropped the big room back into dusk . As the hunter came to the end of the counter their heads turned toward him . " Well I 'm a son of a bee , " Navy Edwards said , and scrambled off his stool . Next to him Billy Hammond half stood up so that his pale yellow hair took a halo from the backbar lights . " Say ! " Max Schmeckebier said . " Say , dot 's goot , dot 's pooty goot , Henry ! " But Henry was watching his father so intently he did not turn to them . He slid the string of ducks off his shoulder and swung them up onto the wide walnut bar . They landed solidly  --  offering or tribute or ransom or whatever they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little act were private between the two of them . He felt queerly moved , his stomach tightened in suspense or triumph . Then the old man 's pouchy eyes slipped from his and the old man came quickly forward along the counter and laid hands on the ducks . He handled them as if he were petting kittens , his big white hands stringing the heads one by one from the wire . " Two spoonbill , " he said , more to himself than to the others crowding around . " Shovel-ducks . Do n't see many of those any more . And two , no three , hen mallards and one drake . Those make good eating . " Schmeckebier jutted his enormous lower lip . Knowing him for a stingy , crooked , suspicious little man , Henry almost laughed at the air he could put on , the air of a man of probity about to make an honest judgment in a dispute between neighbors . " I take a budderball , " he said thickly . " A liddle budderball , dot is vot eats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he turned his head to see the hand with red hairs rising from its pores , the wristband of a gray silk shirt with four pearl buttons . Navy Edwards ' red face was close to his . " Come clean now , " Navy said . " You shot ' em all sitting , did n't you Henry ? " " I just waited till they stuck their heads out of their holes and let them have it , " Henry said . Navy walloped him on the back and convulsed himself laughing . Then his face got serious again , and he bore down on Henry 's shoulder . " By God you could 've fooled me , " he said . " If I 'd been makin ' book on what you 'd bring in I 'd 've lost my shirt . " " Such a pretty shirt , too , " Billy Hammond said . Across the counter John Lederer cradled a little drab duck in his hand . Its neck , stretched from the carrier , hung far down , but its body was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sallow face of his father , Henry thought it looked oddly soft . " Ai n't that a beauty , though ? " the old man said . " There ai n't a prettier duck made than a blue-wing teal . You can have all your wood ducks and redheads , all the flashy ones . " He spread a wing until the hidden band of bright blue showed . " Pretty ? " he said , and shook his head and laughed suddenly , as if he had not expected to . When he laid the duck down beside the others his eyes were bright with sentimental moisture . So now , Henry thought , you 're right in your element . You always did want to be one of the boys from the poolroom pouring out to see the elk on somebody 's running board , and smelled the faint fragrance . That was all the scent she had ever used . My God , he said , how can he stand himself ? After a time his father began to breathe heavily , then to snore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscene  --  loose and bubbling , undisciplined , animal . Henry with an effort relaxed his tense arms and legs , let himself sink . He tried to concentrate on his own breathing , but the other dominated him , burst out and died and whiffled and sighed again . By now he had a resolution in him like an iron bar . Tomorrow , for sure , for good , he would break out of his self-imposed isolation and see Frank , see Welby . They would lend him enough to get to the coast . Not another day in this hateful relationship . Not another night in this room . He yawned . It must be late , two or three o'clock . He ought to get to sleep . But he lay uneasily , his mind tainted with hatred as the room was tainted with perfume . He tried cunningly to elude his mind , to get to sleep before it could notice , but no matter how he composed himself for blankness and shut his eyes and breathed deeply , his mind was out again in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was helplessly hunted again from hiding place to hiding place . Eventually he fell back upon his old device . He went into a big dark room in his mind , a room shadowy with great half-seen tables . He groped and found a string above him and pulled , and light fell suddenly in a bright cone from the darker cone of the shade . Below the light lay an expanse of dark green cloth , and this was the only lighted thing in all that darkness . Carefully he gathered bright balls into a wooden triangle , pushing them forward until the apex lay over a round spot on the cloth . Quietly and thoroughly he chalked a cue : the inlaid handle and the smooth taper of the shaft were very real to his eyes and hands . He lined up the cue ball , aimed , drew the cue back and forth in smooth motions over the bridge of his left hand . He saw the bails run from the spinning shock of the break , and carom , and come to rest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it between two others . He had to cut it very fine , but he saw the shot go true , the I angle off cleanly into the side pocket . He saw the cue ball rebound and kiss and stop , and he shot the 2 in a straight shot for theleft corner pocket , putting drawers on the cuc ball to get shape for the 3 . Yellow and blue and red , spotted and striped , he shot pool balls into pockets as deep and black and silent as the cellars of his consciousness . He was not now quarry that his mind chased , but an actor , a wilier , a doer , a man in command . By an act of will or of flight he focused his whole awareness on the game he played . His mind undertook it with intent concentration . He took pride in little two-cushion banks , little triumphs of accuracy , small successes of foresight . When he had finished one game and the green cloth was bare he dug the balls from the bin under the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eventually , he knew , nothing would remain in his mind but the clean green cloth traced with running color and bounded by simple problems , and sometime in the middle of an intricately-planned combination shot he would pale off into sleep . T T NOON , after the rain , the sun seemed very bright . It poured down from a clearing sky , glittered on wet roofs , gleamed in reflection from pavements and sidewalks . On the peaks beyond the city there was a purity of snow . Coming down the hill Henry noticed the excessive brightness and could not tell whether it was really as it seemed , or whether his plunge out of the dark and isolated hole of his life had restored a lost capacity to see . A slavery , or a paralysis , was ended ; he had been for three hours in the company of a friend ; he had been eyed with concern ; he had been warmed by solicitude and generosity . In his pocket he had fifty dollars , enough to get him to the coast and let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had alternated between dismal hotel and dismal poolroom so long . He could not understand why he had not before this moved his legs in the direction of the hill . He perceived that he had been sullen and morbid , and he concluded with some surprise that even Schmeckebier and Edwards and the rest might have found him a difficult companion . His father too . The fury of the night before had passed , but he knew he would not bend again toward companionship . That antipathy was too deep . He would never think
