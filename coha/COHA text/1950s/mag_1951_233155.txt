In Arizona , 45 miles from Tucson , lies the nation 's biggest untapped source of copper . It is the 4,411-acre San Manuel field , which geologists estimate contains 460 million tons of ore-enough to last the U.S. for about three years . But it has not been exploited because the low-grade ore would be enormously expensive to mine and process . <P> Last week RFC Boss W. Stuart Symington hinted that the Government may lend $75 million to put San Manuel to work to help ease the copper shortage . The loan was requested by little Magma Copper Co. , sixth on the list of U.S. copper producers and owner of the San Manuel property . If the loan goes through , as RFC officials expect , Magma 's San Manuel production should hit 70,000 tons in the next four years , increasing U.S. copper output by 6% . That would push Magma 's total output up to 100,000 tons a year , make the company third in domestic production. * <P> <P> * Top two : Kennecott and Phelps Dodge .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
