txt As Bay State GOP leaders continue their search for a sure-fire means of nominating a strong , well-balanced slate of statewide candidates in 1952 , one top-flight Republican has proposed Massachusetts adoption of a successful California idea . While this leader prefers to remain anonymous , he has talked freely about his proposal . It involves combined action by 100 Republican leaders from all parts of the state to comb the state for candidates , assess them thoroughly , and then back 100 per cent in the 1952 Republican primary the slate chosen by a majority of the leadership group . This approach originally led to the entry of Senator Richard M. Nixon ( R ) of California as a can . didate for the United States House of Representatives seat from the California 12th Congressional District in 1946 . Dinner Set for Nov. 13 The proposal emerges at a time when Senator Nixon is scheduled for an early Massachusetts appearance . He is to be a chief speaker at the ** dinner to be staged on Nov. 13 by the Massachusetts Republican Finance Committee to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hotel Statler . The Bay State GOP chieftain pointed out that in 1946 a group of Republican leaders in the California 12th District banded together to sift the field for Congressional candidates . They actually advertised for prospective aspirants for the GOP nomination , to unseat Representative Jerry Voorhis ( D ) of California . Mr. Nixon . then only recently back from World War II , United . States Navy service . was a last-minute aspirant . The GOP group liked his qualifications and agreed to back him . He won two terms in the House before winning his present Senate seat in 1950 . Support Assured Under the plan , the leaders who sifted the candidates in the California 12th District had agreed to support the candidate decided upon by the majority of the group , Why not try the same plan here in Massachusetts ? asks the Bay State leader . One of the major problems confronting the GOP in Massachusetts is the drafting of a statewide slate more attractive to and more representative of the voters as a whole . As now set up , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or overwhelmingly dominated by Yankee candidates . The so-called minority groups are rarely represented , because of the predominance of Yankee voters in the big Republican-vote counties of Middlesex and Norfolk , With the Republic State Committee maintaining an officially neutral policy during the Republican primary , the voters in general get no solid guide to a diversified , strong slate which would attract a larger vote in the November election . Backed by Leaders Various Republican leaders . including Senators Leverett Saltonstall and Henry Cabot Lodge , Jr. , Sinclair Weeks , Massachusetts Republiean National Committeeman , and many others have advocated restoration of preprimary conventions to endorse statewide candidates as a means of obtaining balanced slates . Such endorsement would free the state committee to back the slate in the primary . Yet preprimary convention legislation appears headed for certain veto by Governor Dever , who is strongly opposed to the idea despite some proconvention sentiment within his own party . Some talk has developed that if the preprimary convention legislation is finally rejected , GOP leaders will stage an unofficial preprimary convention to endorse a slate . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels a stronger party drive could be mounted by a group of 100 top leaders studying the field and agreeing beforehand to back 100 per cent candidates backed by a majority of them . Candidate Is Problem Of course , such a plan would immediately raise cries of bossism . But it is felt that if the 100 GOP leaders represented all segments of the party , racially and geographically , such a charge would be ineffective . The idea seems worth exploring . particularly in view of the fact that at the moment the party is confronted with a major candidate problem . Its candidate possibilities seem divided . mainly into two groups , those who have suffered heavy defeats in the past two elections and some attractive figures untried in the statewide field . To many observers , going to the political well with the same old candidates is an invitation to further defeats . Yet only by united hacking by a large group of top leaders can candidates new to the statewide field even hope for a party nomination at the September primaries .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
