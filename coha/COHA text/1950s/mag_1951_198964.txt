" Hanging out of windows , peering from rooftops , clinging precariously from lampposts , surging in the streets were 400,000 Japanese , almost twice as many as saw Douglas MacArthur off in April . <P> Eager as Dodger fans , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp stools , outside the great , grey Korakuen Stadium 30 hours before the first game against the Yomiuri Giants , the all-Japan champions . The Americans won , 7 to 0 but the Japanese did n't seem to mind .
