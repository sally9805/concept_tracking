txt In his letter to House Speaker Rayburn yesterday , President Eisenhower said the Administration 's requests for new.spending authority could be cut by almost $1.9 billion . This is a commendable start , on the part of the Administration , in the right direction . Jubilation , however , would be premature . Most of the $1.9 billion would not come out of the $71.8 billion the Administration proposes to spend in fiscal 1958 . It would come out of another figure  --  the $73.3 billion the Administration is asking Congress for authority to spend partly in 1958 and partly in later fiscal years . Since the Administration already has a huge carryover of funds appropriated in previous years but still unspent , it 's estimated this $LO billion cut in new spending authority would re . duce the $71.8 billion 1958 spending budget by only a fraction of that amount-8300 million to $450 million . So the President is quite right when he observes in the same letter that " no substantial reduction " in actual 1958 spending can be made " until and unless Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To obtain substantial savings , it is necessary not only to pinch pennies , though that is. a fine idea too ; it is necessary to cut into and in some cases cut out whole programs . And here Congress has a wide open field . It can , to begin with , refuse to accept the nonessential new programs the Administration proposes , like the Federal school-building project . Then it can start whacking at some of those " fixed charges " which we are told time and again simply can not be reduced . The only reason such expenditures are " fixed " is that they are fixed into laws which Congress has passed and which Congress can " revise or repeal . " Like the farm program , for example ; the Administration figures it will cost the taxpayers more than $5.3 billion in fiscal 1958 to keep the price of food and fibre high . A drastic downward revision of these laws would help everybody , including the farmer . Or take the " fixed charge " represented by the veterans ' program ; the 1958 price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable services to veterans should be continued , particularly help for war-disabled ones , but it is not reasonable to go on forever subsidizing the housing , education and other normal expenditures of all veterans . The " fixed charge " label is not affixed to the more than $4 billion the Administration wants to spend for foreign aid ; most Congressmen concede that sum can and will be cut . But there is a tendency to view whatever the Administration asks for the Defense Department as fixed . Yet if COngress really scrutinized this item , it might find that defense could be bought for a good deal less than $38 billion in fiscal 1958 . The fact is that the list of programs eminently suitable for " revision or repeal " by Congress is almost as long as the list of Government programs . And if Congress were to make substantial cuts in programs and apply some of the sav ; ings to the national debt , it would find another huge " fixed charge " coming unfixed  --  the mammoth 87.3 billion interest on the national debt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in horror at the  --  thought of eliminating . or cutting deeply into programs , no matter how foolish or outmoded they may be . Congress would prefer to go on as it is , racking up an impressive-looking record of reducing appropriations requests ( mostly to be spent in future years ) . That 's good as far as it goes , but it does not necessarily cut a cent out of actual 1058 spending . Sure Congress has to cut programs , and the Administration has to stop dreaming up new ones , in order to get big savings . There is no other way .
