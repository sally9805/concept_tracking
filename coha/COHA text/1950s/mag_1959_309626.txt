The new U.S. boom has passed a significant milestone . The buyers ' market of the recession , said the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago last week , has turned into the sellers ' market of prosperity . Rising demand from industry and consumers has increased delivery time on new orders and created scattered shortages for freight cars and trucking rigs . It has also brought a short supply of labor in many skilled trades and slowed the rate of gain in output per worker as the number of jobholders has increased . " Under these circumstances , " forecast the bank , " it appears likely that any substantial further increases in demand may exert additional upward pressure on prices . " <P> Fresh signs that consumer demand is continuing to increase came last week from the Federal Reserve Board . It announced that consumer installment debt in June rose by $452 million ( seasonally adjusted ) , the largest addition for any month since September 1955 . The June increase raised total outstanding consumer installment credit to a new high of $35.8 billion . <P> Increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy 's expansion ; inventories rose to a total of $89.1 billion , an $800 million increase from $88.3 billion at the end of May . The inventory increases largely reflected a buildup of steel stocks in preparation for the strike which showed no signs last week of being settled . Merchants were also prompted by soaring sales . Despite the rise , the ratio of stocks to sales has edged down to the lowest level since 1951 . <P> What all this means , said the Chicago Federal Reserve , is that the current price stability may not continue . Drawing a parallel to the 1955 recovery , when prices held steady , the bank suggests that prices may follow a similar pattern in the second half , then show a broad upward movement in 1960 , as prices did in 1956.
