The dress rehearsal was scarcely finished last week when Songwriter Sammy Cahn shouted to Producer Jerry Wald that the award-giving ceremony of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was not going to fill its allotted time . " You know more than NBC ? " growled Wald . " Yes , " shot back Cahn . But no one was listening . Next day , when the show went on for TV audiences across the U.S. , it was short indeed . It was also pretty bad . Even the early part of the show was poorly organized , unimpressively staged , and sometimes blatantly vulgar . At the end , M.C. Jerry Lewis was left to mug his way through an unplanned 20-minute melee that had the somewhat sweaty aroma of a combination Arthur Murray , Lawrence Welk , Dick Clark free-for-all . <P> Yet for all the pratfalls , it was still Hollywood , pure Hollywood , more enduring than brass . Onto U.S. TV screens flashed a high-style gloss of lovely women and handsome men . bright-eyed before the topmost awards : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinion of their peers , have talent , too . There were so many stars in view that nothing anybody could do-neither an uncivil singing satire by Angela Lansbury , Dana Wynter and Joan Collins , nor some oddly tasteless quips by Bob Hope-could keep the movies from running off with television 's highest rating of the season , and some 85 million viewers . <P> <P> " We Figure . " The winners could not have cared less about their Trendex . The real payoff was at the box office , and the scramble for the little statuettes was long and rough . Since most of the Academy 's 2,087 voters are in Hollywood , the trade papers were barraged with publicity as carefully aimed as that in any congressional race . Actor David Niven , clearly a red-hot contender , paid for some $1,500 worth of personal ads for himself . His producers , Hecht-Hill-Lancaster. shelled out even more . " We evaluate the opposition , " explained one film flack , " and figure how we go from there . " <P> For all the hoopla , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Oscars available ( 23 in all ) that Gigi , winner of the Best Movie award , was able to dance off with eight subsidiary awards without really hogging the show . Best Actress Susan Hayward ( 7 Want To Live ! ) and Best Actor David Niven ( Separate Tables ) were popular favorites . Nobody disapproved of Burl Ives 's Best Supporting Actor award either . Nor was the crowd too upset that Britain 's Wendy Hiller was named Best Supporting Actress for her relatively small role in Separate Tables . <P> " We 're Proud . " Wendy herself was in England , far from the excitement . She took the news with the objectivity that came to Hollywood only on the morning after . " I hope this award means cash , hard cash . " said she . " Never mind the honor . " Her hopes , as all Hollywood knew , were sure to be justified , and the affair was hardly over before the whole town was trying to ride the winners ' publicity .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
