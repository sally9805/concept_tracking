His marriage to Mary Philips the next year lasted until 1937 . In 1933 he took Mayo Methot as his third wife . The couple was divorced shortly before Mr. Bogart wed Miss Bacall . Deflated Publicity Balloons Mr. Bogart was one of the most paradoxical screen personalities in the recent annals of Hollywood . He often deflated the publicity balloons that keep many a screen star aloft , but he remained one of Hollywood 's top box-office attractions for more than two decades . On the screen he was most often the snarling , laconic gangster who let his gun do his talking . In private life , however , he could speak glibly and wittily on a wide range of subjects and make better copy off the cuff than the publicists could devise for him . He had a large , seemingly permanent following among the mass audience . Yet he said he deplored " mass activities . " Furthermore , he did ' everything he could to confound the popular image of a movie star . Mr. Bogart received an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African Queen . " Still , he made it clear he set little store by such fanfare . Earlier he had established a mock award for the best performance in a film by an animal , making sure that the bit of satire received lull notice in the press . Proud of Profession But despite this show of frivolity , he was fiercely proud of his profession . " I am a professional , " he said . " I have a respect for my profession . I worked hard at it . " Attesting to this are a number of highly interesting characterizations in such films as " The Petrified Forest " ( 1936 ) , " High Sierra " ( 1941 ) , " Casablanca " ( 1942 ) , " To Have and Have Not " ( 1944 ) , " Key Largo " ( 1948 ) , " The Treasure of Sierra Madre " ( 1948 ) , " The , African Queen " ( 1951 ) , " Sabrina , " " The Caine Mutiny " ( 1954 ) and " The Desperate Hours " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The Harder They Fall , " was released last year . Mr. Bogart 's high sense of responsibility toward his profession may have stemmed from the fact that both his parents were highly successful professional persons . His mother was Maud Humphrey , a noted illustrator and artist . His father was Belmont DeForest Bogart , a prosperous surgeon . Their son , born on Christmas Day in 1899 , was reared in fashionable New York society . He attended Trinity School and Phillips Academy at Andover , Mass. , but an early note of discord crept into this genteel strain when he was expelled from Andover for irreverence to a faculty member . Mr. Bogart enlisted in the Navy in 1917 and crossed the Atlantic several times as a helmsman aboard a transport ship . As a civilian he was a tugboat inspector and saw brief service in an investment house . Next , he had a job with World Films for a short while and then appeared as a stage manager for an acting group .

" rise to fame over the next fifteen years , however , was a hard road , often lined with critical brickbats . He appeared in " Swifty " and plugged on in drawing-room comedies , appearing in " Hell 's Bells , " The Cradle Snatchers , " " Its a Wise Child " and many others in which he usually played a callow juvenile or a romantic second lead . He accepted a movie contract with Fox in 1931 , but roles in a few Westerns failed to improve matters and soon he was back on Broadway , convinced that his hard-bitten face disqualified him in the close-ups as a matinee idol . In ' Petrified Forest ' But toward the end of 1934 hel used this granite-like face to rebuild , with enormous success , a new dramatic career . Having heard that Robert E. Sherwood 's " The Petrified Forest " had a gangster role , he approached Mr. Sherwood for the important part . The playwright referred him to the director , who told Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Mr. Bogart reappeared before the director he had a three-day growth of beard and was wearing shabby clothes . His reading and appearance brought him the supporting role of Duke Mantee , his most memorable Broadway part . Leslie Howard was the star of the play . Mr. Bogart later did the same part for the movie to considerable critical acclaim . This was the first of more than fifty pictures that Mr. Bogart made , most of them for Warner Brothers . A spate of crime dramas followed , including " Angels With Dirty Faces . " " The Roaring Twenties , " Bullets or Ballots , " " Dead End , " " San Quentin " and , finally , " High Sierra " in 1941 . Mr. Bogart then insisted on roles with more scope . They were forthcoming in such films as " Casablanca , " " To Have and Have Not " and " ' Key Largo , " wherein Mr. Bogart 's notorious screen hardness was offset by a latent idealism that showed itself in the end .

A further range of his talents was displayed also in " The African Queen , " wherein his portrayal of a tropical tramp with a yen for gin and Katharine Hepburn won him an " Oscar . " Another distinguished portrait was that of the- neurotic Captain Queeg in the movie version of " The Caine Mutiny . " His aptitude for romantic comedy became clear when he played the bitter business man who softens under the charms of Audrey Hepburn in " Sabrina . " Mr. Bogart also appeared in " The Barefoot Contessa , " made in 1954 . The movie actor made no secret of his nightclubbing . He was also a yachting enthusiast . At one point in his career he reportedly made $200,000 a film and he was for years among the top ten box-office attractions .
