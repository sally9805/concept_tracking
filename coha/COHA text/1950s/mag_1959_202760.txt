What Jayne Mansfield has , the U.S. has seen so much of so often that she stirs only the mildest of ripples . But in Rio , where movie fans rarely see Hollywood oddities in the flesh , a hard-working girl can still stir a riot , especially at carnival time . Invited down for Mardi Gras by the Copacabana Palace Hotel , Jayne was instantly dubbed " 0 Busto " and missed not an opportunity to justify the dubbing . <P> In five days and nights , she came apart at the seams more often than an overloaded grocery bag . Apart from the day she pendulated across the Avenida Atlntica glued into her briefest bikini ( thus causing a three-car crash ) , almost nothing stayed on . That night , as she danced in the Copacabana Palace Golden Room , an enterprising Brazilian yanked on the zipper at the back of her dress and . presto , 0 Busto was bare to the waist . <P> Next night a second zipper failed as she stepped from her car . Beyond repair , said Jayne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halter and blouse . She drank , danced-and shed her blouse . The topper came when weight-lifting Hubby Mickey ( " 0 Musculo " ) Hargitay performed his famed stunt of hoisting Jayne horizontally into the air over the crowd . The crowd , getting ready for Lent , ogled.
