txt Meeting the Suez Crisis Resort to Arms Held Justified Only Under Most Serious Conditions To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Certain considerations in regard to the Suez crisis have not ' been given the attention that they deserve . The news dispatches , from London ? and Paris have contained frequent references to the possible " necessity " of using force against Egypt if the forthcoming conference should not produce an acceptable settlement , as if there were no serious doubt that its use would be legally and morally justified . History takes a long , hard look at the origins of conflicts and it has been our ' pride , not only as Americans , but as grateful beneficiaries of the Christian and democratic traditions of Western culture , that the Western nations do not resort to arms except when their cause is abundantly justified'by the necessities of their existence , or when a course of aggression threatens the ultimate security of all states . I have been appalled at the lack of serious discussion in this case , and I trust it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stood for . Terms of U. N , Charter To justify the use of force in this case , grave injunctions of great weight would have to be overcome by unmistakable and irrefutable demonstration that the actions of Egypt not only were illegal and potentially dangerous , but that they caused greater damage to the fabric of peace  --  no , to the fabric of civilization  --  than would be caused by a concerted violatio- of the sternest principle of th , . " nited Nations Charter by the very states which had the greatest share in its creation and have the greatest stake in its preservation . The Charter forbids the threat or use of force in terms which are qualified only by the right of self-defense " if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations , " or if it is authorized by a competent organ of the United Nations . The failure of Egypt to accept the decisions of a majority ( even if , as now seems unlikely , it should be a very 14. rge majority ) in a conference convened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of force is clearly being threatened would fall far short of justifying any military action . Such action would stand in history not as a contribution to civilized order , but as the first clear sign that the decline of the West had penetrated to the very vitals of the essential principles which have sustained it . I write not as a pacifist  --  they , in my judgment , should be enjoined by their dogma from making a serious contribution in discussions of this sort  --  but as one who would like the swords of justice kept sharp and clean .

Food Urged for Hungry Nations To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : During and after the war I learned to know what hunger means . It is not only an awful feeling of emptiness in the stomach , but it also revolts the whole being . Now that times here in Europe have taken a turn for the better , in large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , I ca n't stop thinking of the dreadful fact that nearly two-thirds of all human beings , especially in Asia , always have to go hungry , From the papers I know that the United States is in the happy position of having too much food , so much food that there are certain difficulties in storing it . Certainly this storage will cost a lot of money . Thinking of the political situation it is obvious that the United States will have to do something to make good friends with the Asian nations . Would n't it be possible in some way to ship the surplus food to , let us say , India and Pakistan , Give the food away as a present to hungry nations in the same way as you do when you give other help to underdeveloped countries .

Monday I turned on the Democratic Convention program and spent the rest of the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has . long since learned that neitherparty has a monopoly on all the virtues , I would like to set forth some of my reactions . As I listened to John P. Kennedy 's running narrative of the " Pursuit of Happiness " film I wondered how this estimable young gentleman could lend his good name to such a calculated piece of political demagogy , the obvious intent of which was to tell the younger voters that the only progress made by our beloved country occurred under Democratic administrations . Of course the Senator , in his heart , believes no such thing . And how my high regard for him dropped when he attempted to suborn the myth that the Communists who made the ill-fated march on Washington were World War . I heroes . Does he actually believe that Herbert Hoover and General should have sat idly by while this hoodlum gang desecrated our national capital ? Then , too , I wondered whether the Massachusetts Senator did n't have his tongue in his cheek when he assessed the blame for the 1929 stock market crash on tile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from elevator boys to corporation executives throughout ' the country , both Republicans and Democrats , imbued with the speculation fever , were responsible for the ensuing depression rather than the man who happened to be President ? In the organized Democratic tirade against the Republicans as the party of special interests and big business it would not be inappropriate to ask Senator Kennedy and his associates from whence his family fortune derived . And is the Senator under any illusions about the wealth of the Harrimans , the Rooseveils , the Lehmans and the Stevensons ? I am sure that if the portfolios of some of these Democratic leaderg whose hearts bleed so profusely for the " common man " could be made public , their aspersions on " big business " would sound rather hollow to those who , like myself , earn their livings by the sweat of their brows .

Plans for Lincoln Square Lack of Provision for Relocation and Compensation Charged To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The point that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Costs for Lincoln Square , " and in previous ones is that the Lincoln Square Title I Project is not approved and the probabilities are that it will never be approved in its present form . There is great opposition to kt this project at this time not only from the Lincoln Square area but/ from many other parts of the city and for varying reasons . Let me present a few of them : The whole theory of the redevelopment of the Lincoln Square area is that people there are living bad housing . Therefore many b2-lieve that the prime responsibility is to provide improved housing for the people living there . This is not the prime requisite of the Linco In Square plan . By far the greatest number of families would be dislocated by t1is project ( more than 7,000 families ) , more than any previous Title I Project , at a time when low income , low-middle income and true-middle income housing is in short supply . in the City of New York and all of this to provide a cultural center and luxury apartments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when three of the orig. inal four Title I Projects are in default in their relocation process after four years , it is ridiculous to add to the burden of the city 13 ? providing a project which wol0 dislocate an additional more th4 , n 7,000 families . - Despite ' the new Federal law , 30 adequate provision is being mate to compensate the business men to be displaced from the area . The city debt is considerably over $3 billion . Adding this project arid the further tax-exempt land which comprises a portion of it will onlycause an increase in that debt . The bulldozer approach of dealt ... ing ' an entire area is outmoded to ? ? day in view of the shortage of re- ? location facilities . Yet this cob. ? templates the largest bulldozing operation of its kind ever seen in the City of New York . A project of this magnitude will only accentuate the deterioration pf other parts og the city by adding further to/ the overcrowded conditions of low-income areas . In view of some of the aforementioned reasons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . sented at the Board of Estimate meeting on Aug. 30 petitions oh . tained by Lincoln Square residents and business men and residents from other areas of the city containing thousands of signatures in opporrition to this plan . I venture to predict that this project will never be approved in its present form and that all of the ? talk about " Costs for Lincoln , Square " may yet be academic . HARRIS L.

' I was sorry to read in The Tunes that the Rev. Thomas Dunne had died . He was Chaplain of Company I , 306th Infantry , in the first World War . He was kind , generous , and courageous . He was always around to help adjust the petty irritations that invariably beset a company in the process of formation . Many of the men who served with Father Dunne passed away too , bait those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . He gave confidence to those who served and comfort to those who suffered ; and all this with utter disregard for his own safety . Father Dunne carefully avoided any reference to his own experience in the war and talked about the boys with whom he served . ' He exemplified the highest form of patriotism , love of God and country . TIMOTHY DOYLE.i New York , Aug. 10 , 1956.
