Boston 's late Frederic C. Dumaine once advised his hockey-playing son : " If a man hurts you on that rink , do n't lose your temper . Give it to him cleanly , according to the rules , but give it to him . ' ' Young Frederic C. Dumaine Jr . never forgot that advice . Now 51 and head of the family 's $28 million New England empire , Buck Dumaine last week was in the toughest scrap of his life , fighting according to the rules but as hard as he could . <P> Wall Street v. New England . The battle was over control of the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad . The man Buck Dumaine wanted to " give it to " was Patrick B. McGinnis , the Wall Street railroad juggler who recently collided with the ICC over his expense accounts while boss of the Norfolk Southern ( TIME , Feb. 22 ) . In 1948 McGinnis helped old Frederic Dumaine grab control of the New Haven , bought 75,000 shares of stock , largely for clients . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs the road , and is waging a proxy fight to take over the road at the April 14 stockholders meeting . <P> McGinnis charges that the New Haven is in poor shape , has not made anywhere near the money it should . Though the road has reported a profit every year since 1949 , McGinnis argues that the profits come from the road 's real-estate holdings and that the New Haven , as a railroad , has actually lost more than $4 , - 000,000 under Dumaine management . He says that too much money has been spent on new equipment , dragging the road 's operating capital down from $47 million to $11 million in 1953 , and that only preferred stockholders have got dividends since the road came out of bankruptcy in 1947 . On the operating side , McGinnis charges that in six years the Dumaines lost $61 million on passenger service , which makes up 40% of the road 's total business . Says he : " The New Haven is the only railroad that has the density to make passenger traffic really pay . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new lightweight trains . <P> " Spend It To Make It . " In his small , cluttered office in Boston 's South Station . Buck Dumaine challenges McGinnis right down the line . As in the American Woolen battle , Dumaine wants to keep the New Haven in New England hands , has tried to run it to bring new trade to the area . When his father took over , Buck set out to become a railroader , worked alongside yard crews , poked his 6-ft. frame into every corner of the business . Buck , who became president in 1951 , is proud of his record .
