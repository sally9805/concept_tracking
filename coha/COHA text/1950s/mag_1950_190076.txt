Hardly were the stand-or-die orders out of General Walker 's mouth ( see above ) than the U.S. forces began to give more ground . Kochang fell , on the central front , and Kumchon , an important strongpoint on the Taejon-Taegu railroad , was threatened from the southeast . At Chinju on the south coast , after a heavy fight in which Communist dead littered the ground " like confetti , " the defenders pulled back and two Red regiments rushed in . Chinju , 55 miles from Pusan , was the closest Communist approach to the all-important supply port . <P> There were plenty of U.S. heroes . Heroes were not enough . <P> Fruit Cocktail . " We were pinned down all the previous day by enemy fire , " said a U.S. infantry corporal . " Our rations were only five feet away , but we could n't get to them . When we finally could , we found that some rear-echelon boys had stolen all the cigarettes . <P> " The attack came at dawn . I had just time to empty four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My rifle was jammed and would n't shoot . I picked up another and it was no good . I yelled to the lieutenant and he tossed me a bayonet . The first enemy wave was past . I figured I had to die , so I dug out a can of fruit cocktail and ate it . Then the lieutenant asked : ' Are you willing to die ? If you are , I will call for mortar fire . ' I could see the next wave coming , and I said : ' It looks like we 're cooked anyway . Go ahead . ' He called for mortar fire . Some of it hit near us , but most of it went over the hill , into our little friends . " <P> The most alarming event of the week was the North Koreans ' rapid mop-up of the whole southwestern corner of the peninsula and most of the south coast . The U.S. left flank had been dangling somewhere near Chonju ( see map ) ; there were not enough men to extend the Allied line to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be pulled back as Korea 's defenders retired to the build-up zone around Pusan . But the North Koreans sped the withdrawal to a dangerous pace . They simply poured around the open flank . At some points they were lightly resisted by small contingents of South Korean constabulary and marines who fired a few shots before clearing out ; at other points they encountered no resistance at all . <P> The Reds took Namwon , Kwangju and Mokpo-then , wheeling east , Posong , Sunchon , Yosu , Hadong , Ponggye . Elements of the Americans ' tired and battered 24th Infantry Division , which needed a rest , and of the ist Cavalry Division , which could ill be spared from the central front , were wheeled 60 miles south to meet the threat . After the fall of Chinju , the next likely enemy objective was Masan-27 miles from Pusan .
