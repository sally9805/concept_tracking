GUIGNOL 'S BAND ( 287 pp. ) -Louis-Ferdinand Cline-New Directions ( $5 ) . <P> A Beethoven fan once said that the only way to get the real " feel " of his master 's voice was to turn the phonograph up to maximum volume , lie on the floor , fasten one end of a rubber hose over the bellowing speaker , the other into one 's ear . A simpler way of being pounded to jelly is to read a novel by France 's Louis-Ferdinand Cline . No rubber hose can convey the feel of Cline , nor can his own favorite exclamations , such as " Bam ! " , " Bang ! " , " Zoom ! " , " Zimm ! " , " Rrpp ! " , " Rrooo ! " , " Rraap ! " , " Rrango ! " , " Whah ! " <P> Says Cline : " Mumblers and cowards . " or hypocrites who are content to remain " flashy gangrenes , vested in elegant , bloody brocades , " need not read his books . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongues of flame . . . slaking your thirst . . . with a skinful of vinegar , of vitriol so hot that your tongue peels , puffs , bursts . . . and so on through eternal time . . . " <P> What is all the munching and puffing about ? For many years Cline has been the ogre of French literature , a man whose abomination of the civilized world is so great that he has dedicated his life to dynamiting the pillars of society . <P> Apachefied Dickens . Born in 1894 , Cline as an adult became a doctor in the Paris slums , a perfect apprenticeship for a writer who saw everything in terms of filth , corruption and decay . Two novels , boiling with ferocious vitality and humor , Death on the Installment Plan ( TIME , Aug. 29 , 1938 ) and Journey to the End of the Night ( TIME , April 30 , 1934 ) , established Cline 's literary reputation ; but World War II , in which he became a vigorous Nazi collaborator , made him a social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Liberation . On Feb. 21 , 1950 , a French court sentenced Cline , in absentia , to national degradation for life . He has since received amnesty . <P> Time has mellowed Cline 's grisly humor without muting his jungle screams or lessening his power to describe gutter-snipery with the force of an apachefied Charles Dickens . Gnignol 's Band depicts the life of French crooks in the underworld of London during the First World War . The book 's hero , Ferdinand , is a victim of a German strafing attack , which leaves him feeling as if ' ' nailed to the shutter like an owl . " He has a deafening singing noise in one ear . a gnawing migraine , a mere stump of a left arm . Honorably discharged but too beaten up to realize the fact . Ferdinand goes to London , where he makes a beeline for the French " colony " on the river ( " That 's what they call the Thames " ) . In a dockside pub he teams up with Boro , a sleazy French pianist " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
