The scheme , as a whole , came to nothing ; even if it had been carried through it is doubtful whether any information of value about the composition of plant materials would have been obtained by applying the crude methods of lixiviation , extraction , dis tillation and calcination which were all that were then available . But the project illustrates the urge to investigate and experiment which was so apparent in the centres of learning in the middle of the seventeenth century . In England an invention was described about this time which , although it was not much used until the following century , was suitable for the detection of what was then a very common form of adulteration , namely , the watering of milk , wine and other beverages . This was the hydrometer which Robert Boyle , that excellent and great virtuoso ' , as John Evelyn called him , referred to in 1663 as an Essay Instrument ' 1 and which was fully described twelve years later .

' CHAPTER VI DIET AND HEALTH I CHANGES IN SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT FoR the greater part of the century medical teaching remained under the influence of Galen , and diagnosis and treatment were still governed by the humoral system . Its phraseology had become a part of the general speech ; John Evelyn , in the introduction to his Diary , refers to his father as a man of sanguine complexion , mixed with a dash of choler ' . These beliefs were so tenaciously held that the freedom of thought of many who were entering the new field of experimental research was inhibited . Had Fabricius dared to make the logical deduction from his discovery of the valves of the veins in ' Goo , namely that they must serve to prevent the blood flowing in any direction but towards the heart , he could scarcely have failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred years earlier the great Galen had laid it down that the blood ebbs and flows in the vessels and Fabricius hesitated to call such authority in question . Sixteen years later Harvey was bold enough to interpret his own observations without reference to the old theoretical teachings and established that the blood cir culates in one direction only , though he did not publish until 1628 . No one had as yet performed any experiments which might throw light on the views Galen had expressed on the nature of food and digestion , and all the hoary old teachings still survived . Galen saith , that as the broth of a Hen bindeth the body , and the flesh loosneth the same ; so contrariwise the broth of a Cock loosneth , and the flesh bindeth.l Galen saith that the flesh of a Hare prevents fatness , causeth sleep , and cleanseth the blood . ' Galen numbreth it deer 's flesh amongst hard , melancholique , and gross Meats . ' Three sorts of diet were recognized : a full diet , a moderate diet , and a thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and humors , the second repaireth onely them that were lost , and the third lesseneth them all for a time to preserve life . ' 122 . DIET AND HEALTH In simple language this meant that the first was suitable for growing and strong , vigorous people , the second for middle age , and the third for old age or more particularly during illness . Great stress was laid on the substance ' of meats . In substance , such meats are generally commended , which are moist , easy of digestion , and not apt to engender wind , not fried , nor roasted , but sod ( saith Valescus , Altomarus , Pisa , etc. ) hot and moist , and of good nourishment . ' Substance ' was a comprehensive term which covered all that we mean today when we speak of digestibility . Touching the difference of meats in substance : some are of thin and light substance , engendring thin and fine blood , fit for fine complexions , idle citizens , tender persons , and such as are upon recovery out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , young pheasants , partridge , heath-poulse , godwits , all small birds being young , all little fishes of the river , the wings and livers of hens , cockchickens and partridges , eggs warm out of the hens belly , &c.; Others are more gross , tough , and hard , agreeing chiefly to country persons and hard labourers : but secondarily to all that be strong of nature , given by trade or use to much exercise , and accustomed to feed upon them : as poudred beife , bacon , goose , swan , saltfish , ling , tunnis , salt samon , cucumbers , turneps , beans , hard peaze , hard cheese , brown and rye bread , &c.; But meats of a middle substance are generally the best , &; most properly to be called meats ; engendring neither too fine nor too gross bloud.2 Lamb , pork , sturgeon , were meats hot in the first degree ' ; hare , roe-buck , turkey , were hot in the second ' ; onions , scallops and leeks in the third ' , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were so hot ' that they came into a fourth ' degree . Other meats were moist ' , dry ' or cold ' in differing degree , in strict conformity with the Galenic theory . So firmly were these humoral doctrines established that it was possible for a medical man , a leading authority on diet , to believe such fantastic nonsense as the following story . Yea , my self have known a young Maide , of an exceeding moist and cold complexion , whose meat for two years was chiefly pepper , wherewith another would have been consumed , though she was nourished : for it is hot in the third , and dry in the fourth degree.3 // Although most of the seventeenth-century works on food and diet reflect the Galenic teachings , there is traceable in some of them the influence of the school founded in the first half of the sixteenth century by a Swiss alchemist named Paracelsus , or to give him his full name , Phillipus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim . He was a remarkable man if for no other reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the teachings of Galen ; he is reputed to have burnt Galen 's works at his inaugural lecture at Strasburg . The outraged Faculty hounded him out of the University and as a result of his heresies he was forced to lead a peripatetic existence , moving from town to town , writing and teaching , until he died at Salzburg in 154I . A large amount of what he wrote is almost unintelligible , being simply a hotch-potch of alchemy , occultism and astrology , but in two directions his teachings had an effect on contemporary thought . He was the first to advocate the use of mineral remedies in medicine in place of those compounded solely from herbs , and he was the author of a curious theory of the constitution of the material world which gave great prominence to three essential elements , the tria prima , salt , sulphur and mercury . His influence and that of his disciples , who came to be known as the Iatro-chemists ' or spagyrists ' , spread quite rapidly throughout Europe . For the most part it was retrograde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England it was destroyed , almost at a single blow , by the convincing arguments and sound logic of Robert Boyle 's The Sceptical Chymist ( 1661 ) , which showed beyond all doubt that some of the accepted elements must be mixt Bodies ' . Boyle 's chemical studies , which laid the foundation of our knowledge of acids , alkalies and salts , began to influence progressive medical thought towards the end of the century . It is seen clearly , for instance , in one important work published in 1689 , Walter Harris 's De mot-his acutis infantum . Harris was one of the first to turn away from the humoral system and to substitute for it a primitive chemical conception of disease . He thought that all children 's disorders were due to an Acid prevailing through the whole Habit ' and prescribed testaceous powder ' prepared from oyster and other shells , and various other alkaline remedies . Many sick children doubtless benefited by such simple treatment . Harris was , however , ahead of his time and the new chemistry did not have any marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Milk was still regarded as suitable only for young children and very old // people . It was thought to be hurtful to young men because they were by nature choleric . It was liable to cause sore eyes , headaches , agues and rheums because it was full of vapours ' , convulsions and cramps because it led to repletion ' , resolution ' or palsies because it was over moist ' , and stone and other obstructions because the cheesy part of it is very great ' . ' Men still believed that character would be influenced by the milk drunk in youth . For as Lambs sucking she-goats bear coarse wool , and Kids sucking Ewes bear soft hair , so fine Children degenerate by gross womans milk , losing or lesning that excellency of nature , wit , and complexion , which from their Parents they first obtained . ' Very old people and invalids were thought to run the same risk , for it was by no means unusual to provide them with a wet nurse . What made Dr. Cajus in his last sickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he suckt one woman ( whom I spare to name ) froward of conditions and of bad diet ; and contrariwise so quiet and well , when he suckt another of contrary disposition ? verily the diversity of their milks and conditions , which being contrary one to the other , wrought also in him that sucked them contrary effects . ' Pepys heard this story ( which refers to the founder of Caius College ) from Dr Whistler during a merry evening at a tavern with some friends . Many other good stories were told and he remarks that : Their discourse was very fine : and if I should be put out of my office , I do take great content in the liberty I shall be at , of frequenting these gentlemen 's company.4 Asses ' milk still had a great reputation as an alternative to women 's milk for children and invalids . Neither is womens Milk best onely for young and tender infants , but also for men and women of riper years , fallen by age or by sickness into compositions . Best I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milk is best . 5 Lady Gardiner wrote to Sir Ralph Verney during the trying time of the Buckingham election in 1685 : // ... I am sur if you due not begin to take the asses milk quickly , you will have bot a short tim to take it. l 5 3 FRUIT AND VEGETABLES Vegetables , although they gradually became more popular as the century advanced , were not regarded with favour , because they were supposed to engender wind and melancholy . The same Crato will allow no roots at all to be eaten . Some approve of potatoes , parsnips , but all corrected for wind . ' Flatulence seems to have been a common affliction in those days but at any rate there was no lack of remedies ; Burton gives a list of 64 herbs or simples for expelling the wind ' . Fruit was still regarded with suspicion as a result of the survival of the medieval belief that it caused fevers . In the afternoon had notice that my Lord Hinchingbroke is fallen ill , which I fear is with the fruit that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so in the evening I went thither , and there found him very ill , and in great fear of the small-pox. ' 5 4 VIEWS ON DIGESTION The digestion of food was little understood although the Galenic views were elaborated by an important contribution from the famous Belgian alchemist , Jan Baptist van Helmont . He postulated the theory that digestion resembled fermentation in being brought about by a ferment . The first digestion took place in the stomach ? nothing was suspected of the digestive function of the saliva ? through the agency of a ferment which , he thought , came from the spleen . It was known that the contents of the stomach were usually acid , and van Helmont thought that a second digestion occurred when the acid chyle passed from the stomach into the duodenum and became neutralized . The digested food was thought to pass through the walls of the intestines , like water through a pig 's bladder , and to be converted into blood by another ferment in the liver . // In many ways van Helmont 's guesses , for they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe to be the facts , but they attracted little attention at the time because of the obscure and pseudo-mystical style in which the original Latin publication of 1648 was written . The English translation which appeared in 1662 was more popular . About this time the view was gaining ground in England that the dissolution of meat in the stomach was due to the presence of acid . Boyle , however , was sceptical of this theory , for on examining the stomachs of certain fish in which partly digested food was present he was unable to detect any acidity . Yet I am loth , till I have perfected what I design in order to that enquiry , either to imbrace or reject the Opinion I finde so general among the Moderns , concerning the Solution of Meat in the Stomach by something of Acid . ' The older view that the heat of the body caused foods to become digested was more generally accepted . Digestion is performed by natural heat ; for as the flame of a torch consumes oil , wax , tallow , so doth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite unto it , for want of natural heat.2 After digestion the food was supposed to pass as chyle into the blood of the portal vein and so into the liver . The urine and faeces were regarded as the means by which the impurities of the body and the undigested food were expelled but no other means of excretion was suspected until the discoveries of a pioneer investigator named Sanctorius , a professor at the famous University of Padua . The quaint woodcut in his Meclicina Stance shows how he made the observations which led him to postulate an insensible perspiration ' in order to explain the loss in weight which could not be accounted for by the ordinary excretions . After eating a meal he sat in the chair , suspended from one end of a yard-arm , and recorded his gradual fall in weight . He realized that the loss occurred through the mouth and the surface of the skin . Insensible perspiration , is either made by the Pores of the Body , which is all over Perspirable and covered with Skin like a Nett ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually in the space of one Day amounts to about the quantity of half a Pound , as may plainly be made to appear by breathing upon a Glass . ( Aphorism V ) The large amount of insensible perspiration ' surprised him . // If eight Pounds of Meat and Drink are taken in one Day , the Quantity that usually goes off by Insensible Perspiration in that Time , is five Pounds . ( Aphorism VI ) ' He can not be blamed for thinking that the lost weight was mainly moisture for nothing was known of the nature of air and gases until Boyle showed that they are material substances having weight . Indeed it was not until 1668 that Mayow proved that part of the air around us is necessary for re spiration and even that important discovery attracted little attention for nearly a century . ' In the second half of the century there came a reaction against the lifeless , static condition of medical thought . The wisdom which lay behind the aphorisms of Hippocrates and this great master 's insistence on careful study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries become as obscured by convention and concern for orthodoxy as had the teachings of the founder of Christianity and his early disciples . Thomas Sydenham broke away from most of these conventions and tried to build up once again the method of diagnosis based on a close observation of symptoms . His remarkable work The Method of Treating Fevers ( 1666 ) , appropriately dedicated to another revolutionary , Robert Boyle , may justly be regarded as one of the main foundations of modern clinical medicine . It was by no means easy to throw over the old beliefs . Even Boyle , the leader of the new movement of scientific inquiry by experiment and deduc tion , cherished many of them . Sympathetic magic had survived from Greek times . The ancients thought that a milk-stone ' worn by a woman would encourage a good flow of milk ; Boyle strongly recommended the wearing of a blood-jasper to prevent haemorrhagic effusions . The Greeks thought that snake-stone ' was a sovereign remedy for snake-bite ; Boyle knew of a woman who had been cured of incontinence of urine by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in many of the unpleasant and often grue some medical remedies of his day ; powdered dried human excrement blown in the eyes to restore dim sight , woodlice crushed in white wine for ulcers of the breast , raspings of the skull of a dead man for convulsive fits , such were the remedies he offered with profound assurance to the poor Upholders of Families , who can not find or Fee a Surgeon or a Doctor ' , so that they might be cheaply relieved without either of them ' . ' Little wonder that he held , with Paracelsus , that God hath created nothing so Vile , Despicable , Abject I28 DIET AND HEALTH or Filthy in the World , that may not make for the Health and Use of Man ' . ' Some years later Campbell , speaking of the training of physicians and chemists , commented cruelly but not altogether unfairly on this curious strain of credulity in Boyle . Of this Truth the honourable Mr. Boyle is a recent Example , who , after a whole Life spent in the most laborious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicines than what may be pur chased , and that too dear , for Twelve Pence . . . The honourable Mr. Boyle has writ much on this Subject , but he is voluminous ; and it was the Misfortune of that truly great Man , that he was too Credulous , and took many Things upon the Relation of others not sufficiently war-rented by Experiments . ' 5 5 VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY The herbals of the seventeenth century provide indirect evidence that symptoms of vitamin A deficiency were common in England at this time . There are so many references to the use of herbs such as fennel and parsley for mists and films over the eyes that it is fair to assume that mild forms of xerophthalmia and corneal opacities of dietary origin formed a significant proportion of the very prevalent sore eyes ' . The first reference we have been able to trace in English medical works to the value of liver in eye diseases is in Muffett 's Healths Improvement ( 1655 ) . Although liver , as a food , was supposed to be hardly concocted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wholesome because it would please the taste , clear the eye-sight , agree with the stomack , and encrease bloud ' . Walter Bayly , at one time physician to Queen Elizabeth , wrote a treatise on the relation of diet to the state of the eyes , in which he classified a large number of foods according to whether they benefited or impaired the sight . Curiously enough , he thought butter harmful ; indeed , he feared that all oils except sallet oyle ' did more harm than good . With regard to herbs , he said : Albeit few rawe herbes in common vse for sallets are commended , except fenell , eiebright , yoong sage , terragone.3 Peg , the daughter of Cary ( Verney ) , Lady Gardiner , may have been // suffering from xerophthalmia when with ill Eyelidds , &; falling away of the haire , a spott on the pupill , &; a corrupt fistula in the Corner of her Eye towards her Nose ' , ' she was taken to Crick Kerne ' to be examined by Daubeney Turberville , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means unlikely that the children of wealthy parents sometimes suffered from vitamin A deficiency ; the two good sources of vitamin A , green vegetables and butter , were seldom eaten by this class . Even towards the end of the century , when the consumption of vegetables was steadily increasing , they were looked upon as poor men 's food . Butter was eaten in large amounts only by the working classes ; it was despised by the rich who thought it only fit to be used for cooking . Only I wonder with him , Pliny that Africa , and other Barbarous Countreys esteem it a Gentlemans dish , when here and in Holland , and in all the Northern Regions , it is the chief food of the poorer sort . ' Doctors disapproved of it except for growing children . It is also best for children whilst they are growing , and for old men when they are declining ; but very unwholesome betwixt those two ages , because through the heat of young stomacks , it is forthwith con verted into choler . ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said about the relation of vitamin A deficiency to stone in the kidneys or bladder , conditions which were apparently quite common in seventeenth-century England especially among the wealthy classes , that Paracelsus stated that the Dutch were less troubled by stone than other nations because they ate more butter . ' An old Dutch proverb , quoted by Thomas Muffett , says , Eat butter first , and eat it last , and live till a hundred years be past . ' Muffett did not , however , agree with Paracelsus that the Dutch were less afflicted by the stone than the English . ... the silly Alchymist was not a little mistaken , for no people in the world are more subject to that disease , as the number and excellency of stone-cutters in that Country may plainly prove . But Muffett misses the point that it was the rich man who employed the stone-cutter and the poor man who ate the butter . Unfortunately we have no // reliable information with regard to the prevalence of the stone among the wealthy classes compared with the poor people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severely than the latter , and in view of the difference in their diets this may well have been so . 56 GREEN-SICKNESS ' The frequent references to green-sickness ' in seventeenth-century litera ture , both medical and lay , suggest that it was a not uncommon condition . Burton classified it as one of the symptoms and signs of love-melancholy ' ? ' the green-sickness therefore often happeneth to young women " ? and pointed out that since the mind is distracting the spirits the liver is unable to play its part in turning the food into blood . The condition , to which a later generation gave the name chlorosis , is an anaemia of dietary origin . It arises where there is insufficient iron in the food to provide for the formation of haemoglobin , the pigment responsible for the colour of the red blood cells and which plays an essential role in carrying oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body . The green-sickness ' was treated either with herbs or with iron preparations . Sydenham had great faith in chalybeate waters or steel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survived down to the present day . The diet of the time was , as has been shown , largely composed of bread , meat , fish and cheese . Milk , and therefore cheese , is a very poor source of iron . Wholemeal flour , rye and oatmeal contain about 3 mg. per loo g . Meat is , generally speaking , rich in iron ; beef and mutton contain 2-4 mg. and pork 1 mg. per too g. as purchased ' ( i.e. including the weight of bone and other inedible material ) . Liver and kidney are particularly rich with 13-14 mg. per too g . Fish is a poorer source , white fish containing about 0.5 mg. and herring about 1 mg. per too g. as purchased ' . Green , but not root , vegetables are good sources and supply 0.5-1.0 mg. of iron per too g. as purchased ' : most dark green vegetables ( except spinach in which the iron is not available ) contain more than light green vegetables . The body of an adult contains 4-5 g. of iron , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluid . It may be an intrinsic part of the food or it may have been picked up from iron manufacturing or kitchen utensils . The daily loss of iron , in the absence of haemorrhage , is very small ? in the male about 1 mg . It is known that men can maintain normal haemoglobin on a diet containing 8 mg. daily whereas women of child-bearing age become anaemic on such a small intake . The mechanism of iron absorption is very // delicate and is such that if iron is not needed it is not absorbed . On the other hand , in nutritional anaemia , after haemorrhage and in pregnancy it is readily absorbed from almost any source . Iron requirements of adults except pregnant and lactating women are usually placed at 12 mg. daily , and those of adolescents and pregnant and lactating women at 15 mg. daily . A seventeenth-century diet based on wholemeal bread , with some meats and vegetables , should have provided this amount . It seems fair to conclude that chlorosis was not common among those who lived , as did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were better off , however , lived on diets in which meat , fish and cheese formed a much larger proportion of the meals than bread , and poultry , which contains less iron than red ' meats , was becoming popular . It may well be that the chlorotic young women obtained less than their requirement from such diets . An important aspect of this anaemia of dietary origin in women is that the deficiency tends to affect their children . During pregnancy , stores of iron are laid down in the liver of the developing child which are used for the manufacture of blood pigment not only before but after birth , for it is a curious fact that mothers ' milk does not normally contain enough iron for the young child 's needs . If the mother is anaemic during pregnancy the child starts life with deficient reserves and will itself soon become anaemic . Even in recent years this nutritional anaemia was very prevalent ; Dr Helen MacKay held that it was the commonest form of anaemia in infants in this country ' . ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assimilable form , but it is no use giving the iron to the mother and expecting her milk to be en-riched . If nutritional anaemias were at all common in England centuries ago it is certain that there were related anaemias in infants . No treatment was available and it is probable that those who survived gradually recovered when they came to the age at which they could eat bread and other solid foods . // It is hard to decide whether constipation , or costiveness as it was then called , was a prevalent minor disorder at this period . Certainly the poorer people living on coarse wholemeal breads would scarcely have known what it was . The roughage of the bran would have kept their bowels working regularly so that two or even three motions would have been passed daily without effort . Constipation is almost unknown among peasants living on coarse cereal breads . Our own modern diets are so defective in roughage // and in the natural laxative and tonic substances present in wheat germ that our intestinal musculature has to some extent lost the tone which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were to change over to such a coarse diet the immediate result would be a rather sharp attack of diarrhoea . Attempts to replace white flour breads by wholemeal in the diets of schools and institutions have usually had to be made very gradually in order that the muscles of the intestine might become adapted . Although we can safely assume that the poor people were rarely troubled with constipation in the centuries before the introduction of white flour , we can not be so definite about those who were better off . The wealthier classes ate very large amounts of meat and this , being almost wholly digested , would tend to cause sluggishness of the bowels . Most primitive meat-eating races are subject to constipation , which they sometimes relieve by a dose of partly rancid fat . It is interesting , therefore , to find that May butter ' was used in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England as an opening medicine . It is necessary when reading contemporary works to differentiate between the use of purges and remedies for costiveness . The former were very extensively used but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' or black melancholy ' . In illness purges were the almost invariable accompaniment of the bleedings in which so much faith was placed , on the grounds that the poison or putrefactive vapours were being allowed to escape from the body . It is true that many of the purges in common use were laxatives such as senna or rhubarb , but others such as decoctions of fumitory , dandelion , succory or scurvy-grass , were at most mildly aperient , and probably any benefit they produced was due to their antiscorbutic action . It was this type of purge that was very commonly used in spring to cleanse the blood ' . Actually , there are extraordinarily few references to the treatment of costiveness in medical books of this date and , although it is difficult to reach a definite conclusion , one is inclined to think that the population of England was a good deal less troubled by constipation than we are today . CHAPTER VII SCURVY WE have already reached the conclusion that the winter diet of the medieval English peasant would have given little protection against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor country people must have been at least in a pre-scorbutic condition , and that the same must have applied to town-dwellers . There is evidence in support of the belief that pre-scorbutic conditions were common in sixteenth-century England in the frequent mention in contemporary herbals of remedies for making loose teeth ' firm and for puryfying the blod in spryngtyme ' . The majority of these remedies were fresh herbs or extracts prepared from them , fresh strawberry leaves , raw purslane , elecampane leaves , raw gooseberries , decoctions of bramble leaves , leaves in wine , etc . It is interesting that even as late as the first quarter of the twentieth century it was not unusual at least in the north of England to give blackcurrant tea ( made from blackcurrant jam and hot water ) as a cure for colds and sore throats ; another remedy was turnip juice extracted by covering cut turnip with sugar and leaving overnight , and it was customary for all members of at least one family to drink a daily dose of spring medicine ' , a concoction made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , during the early months of the year as a blood cleanser ' . The most serious shortages of fresh foods occurred in the sixteenth century , however , among sailors on long voyages , and during military sieges . Under these conditions scurvy became a dreaded and much-described menace . In his survey A Treatise of the Scurvy ( 1753 ) Lind classified three degrees of violence of scurvy stating firstly that sometimes it rages with great and diffusive virulence ' citing as examples of this epidemic or universal calamity ' , seamen on long voyages , armies , closely besieged troops and occasionally whole countries such as Brabant in 1556 and Holland in 1562 . Secondly where these causes are fixed and permanent , or almost always subsisting , it may be said to be an endemic or constant disease ; as in Iceland , Groenland , Cronstadt , the northern part of Russia and in most northern countries as yet discovered in Europe , from the latitude 6o to the north pole ' . He mentioned particularly the Low Countries , parts of Germany and Scandinavia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently , and are more peculiar to the circumstances of a few , it may there be said to be sporadic , or a disease only here and there to be met with ; as in Great Britain and Ireland , several parts of Germany etc. ' 133 // A legend has come down through early Dutch writings that the Roman legions fell victims to scurvy when they crossed the Rhine and that the Frieslanders taught them how to cure the disease with certain herbs . If there is any truth in the story one of the herbs was probably scurvy grass ( Cochlearia ofzcinalis L. ) which under the name lepelbladen ( spoon leaves ) seems to have been used in Holland for centuries as a household remedy against the disease . ' The Dutch physician , Forestus , made a great reputation for himself about the middle of the sixteenth century by preparing an anti-dote called syrupus sceleturbicus which he concocted from lepelbladen and becca-bunga ( Veronica beccabunga , L. ( Brooklime ) ) . He used it extensively in his own practice and sent supplies all over Flanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover the remedy himself , having com pounded it as a result of information he had received from the country people . It is interesting to note , in passing , that the prevalence of scurvy in the low-lying parts of Flanders gave support to the belief that damp soils , fogs and sea mists played a part in causing the disease . There is no reason for thinking that the Dutch recognized as Schorbuck ' , Scorbuck ' or Scorbuyt ' any-thing but the advanced condition of ill-health which arises when the diet is devoid of vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) . They diagnosed as scurvy the swollen limbs , with dark discoloured blotches caused by haemorrhages under the skin , and the foul mouths , with swollen , ulcerated and bleeding gums . All the evidence points to the English having learnt about scurvy from Dutch sailors , who apparently learnt by experience to carry antiscorbutics with them on their long voyages . Linde coupled the growth of the disease with the great improvement in navigation and the discovery of the Indies and suggested that the first account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in the records of the voyage of Vasco de Gama , who first found out a passage by the Cape of Good Hope to the East Indies , in the year 1497 ; above a hundred of his men , out of a number of a hundred and sixty dying of this distemper ' . He added : At that time , and for a considerable time afterwards it was a disease little known . ' Fernandus Magellan , groping his way round the southernmost point of America in search of a western route to the Spice Islands , entered the Pacific Ocean on November 28th , 1520 . He had been away from land for three months and twenty days , enduring great hardships , when his men began to fall sick . ... having in this time consumed all their Bisket and other Victuals , they fell into such necessitie , that they were inforced to eate the powder // that remayned thereof , being now full of Wormes , and stinking like Pisse , by reason of the salt Water . Another passage indicates scurvy . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of their gummes grew so over their teeth , that they died miserably for hunger . Magellan did not recognize the disease that was decimating his men . He and they came from sunny Portugal where fruit was eaten all the year round , and this was a new affliction . So it was to Jacques Cartier , some months out from St Malo , exploring those partes of America , which lie to the Westwardes , and as it were , to the backside of Newfoundland ' , whose men began to sicken during the long winter at Stadacona in 1535 . At first it was thought to be an infection contracted from the natives . The account of the outbreak and the accurate descriptions of the symptoms and of the prompt relief when a curative herb was found leave no doubt that it was scurvy . In the moneth of December , wee understood that the pestilence was come among the people of Stadacona , in such sorte , that before we knew of it , according to their confession , there were dead above 5o : ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said unknowen sicknes began to spread itselfe amongst us after the strangest sort that ever was eyther heard of or scene , insomuch as some did lose all their strength , and could not stand on their feete , then did their legges swel , their sinnowes shrinke as black as any cole . Others also had all their skins spotted with spots of blood of a purple coulour : then did it ascend up to their ankels , knees , thighes , shoulders , armes , and necke : their mouth became stincking , their gummes so rotten , that all the flesh did fall off , even to the rootes of the teeth , which did also almost all fall out . With such infection did this sicknesse spread it selfe in our three ships , that about the middle of February , of a hundreth and tenne personnes that we were , there were not tenne whole . The captain commanded an image of Christ to be set up on a tree and everyone to prepare himself devoutly by prayer . We know that the first to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the body in the hope that the true nature of the disease might be revealed . The rough and ready post-mortem carried out on the bleak , frozen shore told them nothing . The notes which have been preserved tell us that Philip died , far from his sunny Amboise , a victim of acute scurvy . By mid-March there had been 25 deaths in the camp at Holy Cross // Then it pleased God to cast his pitifull eye upon us , and sent us knowledge of remedie of our healthes and recoverie . The captain 's shrewd observation also played a part . He noticed one day that a native whom he knew to have been grievously ill was cured ; on ques tioning the man he learnt that in the spring the leaves of a certain tree were an effective remedy . He ordered branches of the tree , which is in their language called Ameda or Hanneda ' ( and which the sailors took to be sassafras ) to be brought to him ; the native women instructed the sailors how to make decoc tions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that drink to be made for his men to drink of it , but there was none durst tast of it , except one or two , who ventured the drinking of it , only to tast &; prove it : the others seeing that did the like , and presently recovered their health , and were delivered of that sicknes . Their enthusiasm then knew no bounds . ... it wrought so wel , that if all the phisicians of Mountpelier and Lovaine had bene there with all the drugs of Alexandria , they would not have done so much in one yere , as that tree did in sixe dayes . It is sometimes stated , apparently on the authority of Lind , ' that Cartier 's men were saved by decoctions of spruce tips . The Indian names , Hanneda or Ameda , do not help us to identify the species , but it is almost certain that it was not the American spruce , Picea nigra . This is an evergreen fir and Cartier 's notes particularly refer to the fact that the Indians had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , it is unlikely that the men would have mistaken a spruce for sassafras . The tree was probably Sassafras officinale , which is native to that part of Canada . ' It is none the less interest ing that young pine needles provide an excellent antiscorbutic extract , and are used in the preparation of protective remedies for the children in the north of the Soviet Union , where they are in grave danger of developing sub-scurvy ' during the long winter months . The nature of the Almecla or Hanneda which cured Cartier 's men becomes even more mysterious when we learn that in iGo8 another French explorer wintered at Holy Cross , where he too saw many of his men fall sick . He recognized the symptoms as those of the unknown disease which Cartier had described , and hoped to be able to cure them by the same means . To his surprise the Indians professed to know nothing of , 4meda or Hanneda and // he lost forty men before the spring came and the survivors were able to cure themselves by making decoctions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were soon followed by the Dutch and the English . Many of the expeditions must have been ravaged by scurvy for only the Dutchmen seem to have had any acquaintance with the disease or , rather , to have recognized it . The English medical works of this period make no reference to it . Andrew Boorde claimed that his Breviary of Healthe ( 1552 ) treated of all manner of sickness and diseases , which may be in man or woman ' but scurvy was not one of them . Popular herbals and books of remedies and simples such as William Turner 's The Names of Herbes ( 1548 ) and Sir Thomas Elyot 's Castel of Helth ( 1539 ) , pay little attention to antiscorbutics . It is not certain where the sailors learned the value of fruit and salads but probably from the Dutch on the west coast of Africa . Being accustomed to treat it at home with simple herbs it would not have been long before the Dutchmen discovered that tropical fruits made a good substitute . It is clear that in the latter part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruits was beginning to be recognized in England . Gerard 's Herbal/ was published in 1597 , and although it was compiled very largely from Continental sources there is evidence that the malady was by this time well known in England . Gerard described it very accurately . The gums are loosed , swolne and exulcerate ; the mouth greeuously stinking ; the thighes and legs are withall verie often full of blewe spots , not vnlike those that come of bruses : the face and the rest of the bodie is oftentimes of a pale colour ; and the feete are swolne , as in the dropsie . He added that the disease haunted camps ; he doubtless had in mind the many occasions during the wars on the Continent on which it had ravaged the inhabitants of besieged cities . Gerard recommended garden cresses as good against the disease which the Germaines call Scorbuck and Scorbuyt : in Latine Scorbutus : which we in England call the Scuruie , and Scurby , and vpon the Seas the Skyrby . ' He also advised the use of winter cresses because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasse , called in Latin cochlearia , causing it to worke the more effectually . ' The voyage of Sir John Hawkins 's son , Sir Richard Hawkins , to the South Seas is important to us in attempting to trace the growth of knowledge in England regarding scurvy . In 1593 his ship the Repentance lay off the Royal Palace at Greenwich . The Queen 's Majestie ' was rowed out to inspect her and everything except the name received the royal approval . She was promptly renamed the Daintie and after provisioning at Plymouth with Beefe , Porke , Bisket and Sider ' , set sail for the South Seas . After leaving the // Canaries they came to within three or four degrees of the Equinoctial Line and within a few days scurvy had appeared . The signes to know this disease in the beginning are divers , by the swelling of the gummes , by denting of the flesh of the legges with a mans finger , the pit remaining without filling up in a good space : others show it by their lasinesse . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the disease , before recognizable symptoms had appeared , often led to confusion between cause and effect . Gerard expressed a popular opinion when he said that the disease attacked such as delight to sit still without labour and exercise of their bodies ' . Hawkins , who thought that the primary cause was change of aire in untemperate climates ' and that a diet of salt meat and insufficient exercise were contributory factors , recommended that the ships ' company be kept occupied in some bodily exercise of worke ' . He had considerable experience , for in twentie yeeres ( since I have used the Sea ) I dare take upon me , to give account of ten thousand men consumed with this disease ' . He held the view that prolonged exposure to sea air increased the tendency to develop scurvy . To counteract this exposure he ordered that the decks should be washed with vinegar and that tar should be burnt . He also recommended closing the pores of the skin . This he proposed to do by giving every man in the morning a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beere , or Wine mingled with water ... that the poores of the bodie may be full , when the vapours of the Sea ascend up ' . In these early views of the English sailors is to be found the reason why sea scurvy ' and land scurvy ' came to be regarded as different diseases . Outbreaks were so much more frequent at sea and the symptoms were usually so much more severe that the acute form of the disorder came to be associated with sea air , sea salt and salted fish and meat . Sir Richard Hawkins knew of the curative action of sour Oranges and Lemons ' but he did not put them first on his list of antidotes. ... the principall of all is the Ayre of the Land ; for the Sea is naturall for Fishes , and the Land for men . Nevertheless , he was glad to reach Santos where he was able to get fruit for his suffering men . This is a wonderfull secret of the power and wisdome of God , that hath hidden so great and unknowne vertue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this infirmity . An occasion on which a chance discovery of scurvy grass saved an // expedition is told in the story of William Barent 's voyage to find the North Passage in 1596 . The ship was frozen into the ice in August of that year and a long and anxious winter was passed in a house which they built upon the ice floes . In spite of strict rationing their bread and beer were eventually exhausted and they had to keep themselves alive on the meat of the foxes and bears which they shot . Their privations lasted for months and there was a good deal of illness . On July 3ist , 1597 , nearly a year later , they sailed away and found land . ... in this Iland wee found great store of Leple leaves , which served us exceeding well , and it seemed that God had purposely sent us thither : for as that wee had many sicke men , and most of us were so troubled with a scouring in our bodies , and were thereby become so weake , that wee could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were healed thereof : for that as soone as we had eaten them , we were presently eased and healed , whereat wee could not choose but wonder , and therefore , wee gave God great thanks for that , and for many other his mercies shewed unto us , by his great and unexpected aide lent us , in that our dangerous Voyage : and so as I said before , wee eate them by whole handfuls together , because in Holland we had heard much spoken of their great force , and as then found it to be much more than we expected . There is a marginal note to this account in Purchas His Pilgrimes : Scurvygrasse , or Leple leaves cure their scouring and Scorbuticall infirmitie . ' The discovery of the exceptionally high antiscorbutic power of oranges and lemons led to interesting developments . Efforts were made to preserve the juices so that they might be carried on long voyages . As most of these efforts depended on the preparation of syrups by the evaporation of the juice over an open fire it is probable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sailors might use dried herbs and evaporated juices preserved in bottles with a narrowe mouth , full about to the necke , and the rest filled up with oliue oile , to keep it from putrefaction ' . One voyage on which lemon juice was used , although whether it was preserved in this manner is not known , was the first English expedition to the East Indies which sailed under the command of Master James Lancaster on behalf of the newly formed East India Company . The four ships left Woolwich on February 13th , i600 , and after a slow voyage crossed the tropic of Capricorn on July 24th . They had last touched land , at the Canaries , on May 7th . August began with very many of our men ... fallen sicke of the Scurvey in all our ships ' but one ship , the Commander 's , had surprisingly few cases . 14o SCURVY And the reason why the General 's men stood better in health then the men of other ships , was this : he brought to sea with him certaine Bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each one , as long as it would last , three spoonfuls every morning fasting : not suffering them to eate any thing after it till noone . This Juice worketh much the better , if the partie keepe a short Dyet , and wholly refraine salt meate , which salt meate , and long being at the Sea is the only cause of the breeding of this Disease . Impressed by the experiences of this voyage the East India Company arranged for a supply of lemon-water for all its ships . Another voyage , commanded by William Keeling , set out in 1607 and returned in May 161o . With the help of the lemon-water and occasional supplies of fresh fruit they kept free of scurvy , but on the homeward voyage they met some Dutchmen less fortunate than themselves . The eight and twentieth , in the morning , the wind being Westerly , and reasonable faire weather , we steered with the Dutch . . . He told us , that he had but eight or nine men standing , the rest sicke , and sixe and forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , a never sufficiently acknowledged mercy : that they who offered to spare me ten or twenty men , or more upon occasion , should so generally decay , and we lose no one , nay every one in good health . At this time the Dutch Company was trying to supply their East Indiamen with fruit from special ships . They had also established a garden at the Cape to grow vegetables for sick sailors . One fact which struck these early explorers , and it had a far-reaching influence on later views about scurvy , was that the sourer and more acid fruits seemed to be the best antiscorbutics . This gave rise to the belief that the curative virtues lay in the acidity and as fruit juices were difficult to keep in hot climates other acid drinks were used instead . Some people put their faith in vinegar , others in oil of vitriol ( sulphuric acid ) . It is difficult to understand how these liquors maintained their reputation as efficient antiscorbutics . Perhaps if the vinegar had come from a barrel of pickled herrings it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no explanation has yet accounted for the extraordinary reputation enjoyed by oil of vitriol for more than a hundred years . Sir Richard Hawkins thought it valuable , if less effective than fresh fruit . The Oyle of Vitry is beneficiall for this disease : taking two drops of it . There is not a single suggestion in these early records that the disease was // caused by lack of fresh fruit or vegetables . It was always ascribed to the influence of sea air , to too much salt meat or to the change in the habits of life . The curative action of the antiscorbutics was in no way related to the primary cause of the trouble . This may appear strange to us who think so readily in terms of dietary deficiencies and their correction but we must not forget that in those days the cause of a disease and its cure were not neces sarily associated in the minds of medical men . They were the days of abso lute faith in the herbal . God had given man a herb to cure every ailment ; scurvy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pimpernel was provided as a cure for the plague . It no more occurred to them that scurvy was due to a lack of scurvy grass , or similar herbs , than that a deficiency of pimpernel would bring about an outbreak of plague . The idea that illness could be related to a purely negative factor , the absence of something , re mained unacceptable to the medical profession for some hundreds of years to come , and persisted even after the discovery of vitamins . During the later part of the sixteenth and the opening of the seventeenth century scurvy undoubtedly attracted a great deal more attention in England than it had formerly done . In medical circles interest was stimulated by the works of such foreign authors as Wierus ( 1567 ) , Forestus ( 1595 ) , Eugalenus ( 1604 ) and Sennertus ( 1624 ) , 1 which became known over here through the influence of the great Dutch medical schools , notably that at Leyden . They gave reasonably accurate pictures of the disease but offered no more satis factory explanation of its appearance than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' or corruption of the humours ' . Sennertus wrote : It is an evil occult quality , or disposition , impressed upon the whole body , chiefly the parts destined for nutrition , arising from gross melan choly or serous ichorous humour after a peculiar manner corrupted with lassitude and heaviness.2 Maynwaring , one of the earliest English writers on scurvy , commented this definition looks imperfect and unsatisfactory ' , but he himself offered sixteen theories to account for the origin of the disease , each one as obscure and meaningless as that of Sennertus . ' The other English writers were little better . Willis , who gave a very complete description of the symptoms , thought the principal causes were unwholesome air and a vitiated texture of the blood ' .4 Gideon Harvey , physician to Charles II , caused some // confusion by attempting to differentiate between mouth-scurvy , leg-scurvy , acid-scurvy , joint-scurvy , stomachic-scurvy , land-scurvy and sea-scurvy.l Harvey spoke of it as the Disease of London ' . He thought it infective , its miasma being communicable by contact . Infants , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by people suffering from the disease . Confusion with other skin diseases would account for this belief . John Woodall , who was appointed surgeon to the East India Company in 1612 , wrote a valuable book entitled The Surgions Mate ( 1612 ) , in which he gave a full account of the diseases of seamen and the methods of treating them . Scurvy is one of the diseases he mentions . The cheefe cause whereof is the continuance of salt diet , either fish or flesh , as porke and the like , which is not be auoyded at sea , as I suppose by the wit of man : another cause , is want of sufficient nourishing food , and of sweete water , and also for want of Aqua vitae , wine , beere , or other good water to comfort and warm their stomackes , which by contrary windes men are too much incident vnto in long voiages how souer the Marchants are carefull , prouident , and bountifull in that point . Scurvy grass , horse radish , sorrel and similar herbs , were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how farre they extend only to the cure of those which flue at home , or else it may bee sayd , they also helpe some sea men returned from farre ' . He did not know that Hudson 's men , on their fateful voyage to find the North-West Passage in 161o , had once been saved by touching land where they were able to gather ' Sorell , and that which wee call Scurvy-grasse , in great abundance ' .2 In the case of sea scurvy Woodall put his faith in the curative action of the citrus fruits . And further experience teacheth which I haue oft found true , that where a disease most raineth , euen there God hath appointed the best remedies for the same grefe if it be his will that they should be dis covered and vsed : and note for substance , the Lemmons , Limes , Tama-rinds , Oringes , and other choyce of good helpes in the Indies which you shall finde there doe farre exceed any that can be carried thither from England , and yet there is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England by the great care of the Marchants , and intended onely for the releefe of euery poore man in his neede , which is an admirable comfort to poore men in that disease ; also I finde we haue many good things that heale the Scuruy well at land , but the Sea // Surgeon shall doe little good at Sea with them , neither will they indure . The vse of the iuyce of Lemons is a precious medicine , and wel tried , being sound &; good , let it haue the chiefe place for it will deserue it . He also supported the seaman 's belief that oil of vitriol was a good remedy . ... and in want of all these vse oyle of Vitrioll . . . I can affirme that good oyle of Vitrioll is an especiall good medicine in the cure of Scuruy . William Cockburn , physician to the Fleet at the end of the seventeenth century , was another who believed that sea scurvy was a distinct disease , primarily caused by over-indulgence in salt foods . I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sickness is produced with us , and to show that ' t is a necessary consequence of an idle life , and a feeding on Salt Beefe and Pork . " Honest Dr. Cockburn ' , as Swift called him , had an eye for publicity and the main chance . He quite unblushingly took for himself the credit of ascribing scurvy to salt food . Dr. Boerhaave , the famous and learned Professor of the Practice of Physick , in the University of Leyden , has not concealed his Esteem of my Performance , but has taught publicly , in his Schools , my Doctrine of the Scurvy . ' He spoke of an outbreak which occurred in 1695 in the ships which had been moored in Torbay for a month , during which time the men had not been allowed to land . He urged the Commander , Lord Berkeley , to put the sick men ashore but was met with the objection that if this were done they might take the opportunity to desert . The men , however , became so ill that finally more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rowed to land where they were able to get carrots and turnips and other Green Trade ' . Within a week they were crawling about and soon all but two or three were fit to return for duty . ' The French physician , Chameau , who lived in England for some time , was greatly impressed by the prevalence of scurvy in this country . ' It was apparently but little known in France for an outbreak in Paris in 1699 // attracted a good deal of attention . ' It is difficult to say whether this merely indicates that the doctors had learnt to recognize the disease but it certainly seems the most probable explanation , for there is no evidence that less fruit and vegetables were eaten ; indeed , as we have seen , there are reasons for thinking that the reverse was the case . The seventeenth-century doctor may , of course , have diagnosed scurvy simply to be in the fashion . Thomas Sydenham hinted that this was so , for he observed that the two great subter fuges of the ignorant physicians of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blamed for disorders and symptoms often owing to their own ill-management ' . One wonders what he would have said if he could have seen the advertisement which John Pechey , M.D. , brazenly attached to his translation of Sydenham 's works which appeared in 1696 , seven years after the latter 's death . Excellent purging Pills prepared by John Pechey . . . Basing-Lane , London . They cure the Scurvy , the most reigning Disease in this Kingdom . . . The Price of each Box is one Shilling Sixpence with Directions for use . There was considerable confusion between the forms of scurvy seen at sea and on land . Most people believed they were distinct diseases , probably because at sea the symptoms appeared rather suddenly and were usually much more severe . One reason for this was that once the fresh provisions were exhausted the sailors were living on a diet almost completely devoid of the antiscorbutic vitamin . On land few except the very poor or those in prison suffered so severe a deprivation . Their diets were rarely wholly defic ient in vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more insidious and the symptoms less clearly marked . It is now known that severe injury increases the body 's utilization of vitamin C. Thus , another reason for the severity of scurvy at sea may have been that the hard conditions of life there ? the fatigue and exposure to cold and injury ? increased the sailor 's requirements for the vitamin . The most popular remedies were oranges , lemons and oil of vitriol at sea , and scurvy grass , brooklime or cresses on land . Parsley , chervill , lettuce , purslane , winter rocket and strawberries were all recomemnded as good to fasten loose teeth and to heal spungy , foul Gums ' .2 Robert Boyle gave a recipe based on an infusion of barley and lemon rind , which he recom mended for scorbutick cholick ' , ' but scurvy grass was the remedy most widely used . Judging by an entry in the household books of Lord William // Howard ( 1612-33 ) , 1 Skirvie grasse for my Lady ijs ' it was by no means inexpensive . The most popular method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as follows : Of the juyce of scouruy-grasse one pint ; of the iuyce of water-tresses as much ; of the iuyce of succory , half a pint ; of the iuyce of fumitory , half a pint ; proportion to one gallon of ale ; they must be all tunned vp togither.2 Scurvy grass ale was usually recommended in the spring , a time when scorbutic symptoms would have been at their worst . An item in the accounts of the Woburn household of the Earl of Bedford ( 1653 ) concerns the pay ment of 4d. to John Morrice for scurvy-grass , or gittings , to put in the children 's ale ' . ' It is significant that the date is April . In 1678 the patients in St Bartholomew 's Hospital were given scurvy grass ale , provided it was ordered by the doctor and entered in the apothecary 's book . ' A translation of Moellenbrock 's book on this herb appeared in England in 1676.6 ' T is a Treatise of Scurvy Grass , a Plant that grows very plentifully in our Country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scurvy , in which disease it is particularly advantagious , is but too frequent amongst us , which our own experience doth sadly confirm . It is interesting to note that the author thought the curative action of scurvy grass , although occult and secret , as almost all modern Physitians do agree ' , to be due to a volatile salt of a certain bitterish Taste ' , which counteracted the gross and fixed salt ' in which the scorbutick humour abounds ' . A plausible theory had been evolved regarding the cause of the disease . Salt foods loaded the blood with a fixed ' salt , which required for its dispersal the administration of a volatile salt ' . The uses to which scurvy grass was put are well illustrated by the following quotations from Moellen brock 's book . ... take of Scurvy-Grass very small cut or minced , and adde of juice of Lemmons or sour Orenges , and so you will have a Sawce pleasant to the taste , and effectual against the Scurvy , for these kind of Sawces are mighty advantagious in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserved from this Disease by the use of them , as is attested by Gr .

CHAPTER VIII RICKETS I GROWTH OF BONES THE bones of an infant are soft and pliable , but during the period of growth they become gradually hardened by the deposition of mineral material which is almost entirely composed of calcium phosphate . This substance is also responsible for the hardness of teeth . It is deposited in soft matrix structures as a result of precipitation brought about by interaction of compounds of calcium and phosphoric acid which are present in the blood . The process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only at sites of ossification and not all over the body is extraordinarily interesting . It can best be explained by first describing a simple chemical experiment . Sodium phosphate and calcium chloride are white solids which dissolve very readily in water to form clear solutions . If a few drops of one are added to the other a white precipitate of calcium phosphate is formed unless the original solutions were exceedingly dilute . The reaction can be represented as follows : sodium phosphate + calcium chloride = ( soluble ) ( soluble ) calcium phosphate + sodium chloride ( insoluble ) ( soluble ) There is a critical strength of the solutions at which on mixing the first signs of a precipitation occur . Solutions that are more dilute remain clear indefinitely when they are mixed . They can , however , be made to deposit calcium phosphate in solid form by the simple procedure of adding a minute amount of a stronger solution of either component . It is not sufficient to add more of the original solutions , it is necessary to raise the concentration either of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals contains both soluble calcium compounds and phosphates but the amounts which are present in forms capable of reacting according to the simple equation given above are insufficient to permit the deposition of calcium phosphate . In other words , the critical concentration has not been reached . Obviously , this is the only possible state of affairs ; otherwise solid calcium phosphate would be deposited in every part of the body and would soon lead to extensive calcification . What is needed , therefore , to bring about deposition of solid calcium 147 // phosphate in the bones and teeth of a normal infant is a local increase at those sites of the concentration either of reacting calcium compounds or phosphates , or both . Such an increase does , in fact , occur . It is brought about by the action of one of those substances known as the enzymes , which are the agents by which the cells of the body carry out all manner of chemical changes , and which seem to have a constitution intermediate between the non-living proteins and the living viruses . The enzyme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centres at which bone formation is required and it brings about the necessary changes in the local conditions by converting a phosphate in the blood which does not react with soluble calcium salts into one that does . The increase in the local concentration of phosphate is then sufficient to cause precipitation of calcium phosphate . In this manner the tooth or developing bone becomes gradually ossified and hardened . But conditions are not always like this . Sometimes , for example , the amounts of calcium and/or phosphate in the blood become raised beyond the critical concentrations required for precipitation . Over-activity of the parathyroid gland or very excessive treatment with vitamin D have such an effect and raise the concentration of calcium in the blood from the normal level of about to mg. per 10o c.c. to as much as 15 mg. per too c.c . This may result , as one would expect , in more generalized deposition of calcium phosphate . In the very early days of enthusiasm for vitamin D therapy , before it was known that heavy dosage had this undesirable effect , several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other organs of young children as the result of such treatment . On the other hand , there are conditions in which there is less calcium and/or phosphate in the blood than there should be . One of these conditions is known as rickets . The amount of phosphates in the blood of a rachitic child is low . Sometimes the amount of calcium may be subnormal . This means that even with the supplementary action of the enzyme operating at the sites of bone formation there may be insufficient calcium and phosphates in reactive forms to provide for normal deposition . Such is the case in rickets and it explains why the bone is soft and apt to bend under pressure . Rickets is a reflection of disordered metabolism of calcuim and phosphorus , and as soon as means are found to raise the amounts of these substances in the blood to a normal level the formation of bone proceeds regularly once again . In studying rickets , therefore , we have to focus our attention , not on the bones which show the obvious defects , but on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soluble bone-forming salts . It has already been stated that these are originally derived from the food and it would be reasonable , therefore , to think that the amounts in the blood depend solely on the amounts in the diet . To some extent this is true , but the relationship // is by no means a simple one . The calcium and phosphates must be absorbed from the digestive tract before they can enter the blood stream and the extent to which they are so absorbed is determined not only by the amounts in the food but also by the ratio between these amounts . At one year a child should be getting about I g. of calcium a day and about half to three-quarters of this amount of phosphorous . The demand for calcium rises to 1.2 to 1.3 g. at puberty ( and the desirable calcium/phosphorous ratio falls ) , amounts of calcium which can be supplied by 11 to 2 pints of milk . There are all sorts of complications which make the assessment of these requirements difficult . One is the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , occur in foods in many different forms , some of which are more assimilable than others . Cereals , for example , contain a compound known as phytin which , although very rich in phosphorus , yields little to the body during digestion . Another is the part played by vitamin D. // About a century ago medical men in Europe began to appreciate the value of cod liver oil in curing rickets . The reason for its curative effect was not known , although it was the subject of much speculation , until Professor ( later Sir ) Edward Mellanby made his pioneer investigations on the part played by diet in the causation of the disease . Earlier investigators had suspected that improper feeding was responsible , but they had laid the blame on such faults as too little lime or too much starchy food . Mellanby 's experiments showed that one of the vitamins is necessary for the formation of healthy bones and teeth and that this substance accounts for the curative action of cod liver oil . For a time his views seemed to be in conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fresh air and sunlight , and other defective hygienic surroundings , were primary factors in the production of the disorder . These two opinions , which at one time appeared to be irreconcilable , were correlated by the remarkable discovery that the short wave-length rays of the sun , the ultra-violet rays which cause tanning , produce a vitamin D in the superficial layers of the skin . A rachitic child can be treated equally well , therefore , by administering vitamin D directly in the form of a fish liver oil , or by giving sunlight treatment or ultra-violet therapy , thereby enabling the body to form its own vitamin . For some time after the recognition that the beneficial effect of cod liver oil in rickets is due to vitamin D it was thought that there was only one such vitamin and that there was no better source . Subsequently it was discovered // that the liver oils extracted from certain other species of fish are very much more potent than cod liver oil , and that there are at least three different vitamins of the D type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the individual vitamins are very closely related and can be probably regarded as having the same physiological action . Some fish liver oils are very much richer in vitamin D than cod liver oil . The following list shows the range of potencies that are encountered . Table By the side of the potencies of ordinary natural foods which contain vitamin D ( butter , 0.1-1.0 ; egg yolk , 1.5-5.0 i.u. per g. ) some of these figures appear almost fantastic . They raise the interesting question why there should be such relatively enormous stores of vitamin D in the liver of some fish and little in the liver of mammals . No answer to this question has yet been found . It is known , however , that in any one species of fish the stores of vitamin D increase with age . Modern research has shown that the administration of a vitamin D increases the amount of calcium , and possibly also that of phosphates , absorbed from the digestive tract and retained in the body . Its intervention is , therefore , particularly helpful in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is least needed when absorption of bone-forming salts is good . A child needs relatively a large dose of vitamin D when its diet is poor in lime and/or phosphate or when the calcium/phosphorus ratio is faulty ; it needs very much less when its food is rich in these constituents and the proportion between them is favourable to good absorption . Mothers ' milk contains a good deal less calcium and phosphorus than cows ' milk . In spite of this it is very rare to detect any trace of rickets in an infant fed at the breast of a well-nourished woman . This means that the utilization of the bone-forming elements of mothers ' milk is usually excellent . So far as we know this is due to the calcium being present in a very readily assimilable form and to the fact that the calcium/phosphorus ratio ( about 2 ) is ideal . Vitamin D seems to come into the picture to a relatively unimportant extent because very little is found in human milk ; Drummond and his colleagues found a range of values from 2-9 i.u. per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // 3.5 . This means that the unsupplemented intake of an infant is often less than zo units a day and seldom rises above double that figure . During recent years the requirement of infants and young children has usually been set at 400-80o i.u. of vitamin D daily , a quantity which has been given , and sometimes exceeded , in the form of cod liver oil or other fish liver oils and dried milk fortified with additional vitamin D. Very recently a new condi tion has been reported though never in wholly breast-fed infants ? idio pathic hypercalcaemia , a condition causing loss of appetite , vomiting , constipation , failure of growth , listlessness , mental retardation , increased re tention of calcium and phosphorus , calcification of parts of the kidney and sometimes death . At the time of writing consideration is being paid to the dangers of excessive amounts of calcium and vitamin Din the diets of infants , particularly those who are artificially fed , though these factors are unlikely to provide the complete answer to the problems raised by this type of abnormal metabolism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later the worst period in English history , so far as rickets is concerned , was during the rapid industrialization of the towns which occurred in the ' forties of the nineteenth century . The disease had , however , been prevalent for at least two centuries . Some authorities believe that this was why it came to be generally known on the Continent as The English Disease ' ( Die englische Krankheit ) , although others favour the view , and it seems the more plausible one , that it arose from the fact that English medical writers were the first to recognize and describe the disorder and its symptoms . The most important of these works appeared in 1645 and 165o respectively and both authors assured their readers that the disease was a new one , having made its appearance in England some twenty years or so previously . Does this mean that rickets was almost unknown in pre-Stuart England and that Whistler 's and Glisson 's accounts of it were something quite new to the doctors abroad ? This is a question which it is very difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes brought forward to show that rickets was common in the Low Countries and north Germany in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries . It is derived from a study of the paintings of that period , most of them , of course , of religious subjects , in which many of the infants are depicted showing the characteristic bent limbs , swollen abdomen and square head of the rachitic state . ' This may mean that the // disease was so prevalent that an artist quite naturally painted a young child showing these abnormalities . On the other hand , it must not be forgotten that at that period the Flemish school was inclined towards conventionalism and that there was a great deal of copying , particularly of human figures . If rickets was as common in Flanders and north Germany as our first impres sion of these pictures might lead us to think , it is rather surprising that , after the publication of the descriptions of the disease by Whistler and Glisson , the Dutch and German medical men ? the former among the best in Europe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own countries . The evidence is not sufficient for us to assume that rickets was common in north-western Europe before it was recognized in our own country al-though , as we shall see , it is likely that it was known . The history of its recognition is an interesting one but complicated , as so many scientific dis cussions are , by rival claims regarding priority , although in this case they were made not by the original writers themselves but have been since ad vanced by commentators . It will be best , perhaps , if the known facts be treated chronologically . So far as we have been able to discover , the first mention of the disease by the name of rickets is in a Bill of Mortality for the City of London , dated 1634 . It must have been a fairly well-known condition by then because these Bills were compiled by the Parish Clerks from lists furnished every Tuesday by the Searchers ' , whose duty it was to inspect the dead and register the cause of death . The Searchers hereupon ( who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place , where the dead Corps lies , and by view of the same , and by other enquiries , they examine by what Disease or Casualty the Corps died . ' We are not at the moment concerned with the unreliability of the lists drawn up by these searchers , who were seldom able to diagnose the cause of death except in such obvious conditions as plague . What does impress us is that in 1634 a condition known as rickets was sufficiently well known to be one of the recognized causes to which death was attributed ; 14 were recorded in that year . The next important date is 1645 when a young English doctor , Daniel Whistler , who entered the University of Leyden in 1642 , was awarded the degree of Doctor of Medicine there for a Thesis entitled De Morbo puerili Anglorum , quam patrio idumate indigenae vocant The Rickets ' . The record in the University archives reads : // Ex Actis Senatus Anni 1645 rectore Polyandro Octob. 17 . Concessus est Danieli Whistler ad disputandum privatim pro supremo in Medicina gradu dies ejusden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whistler cui supremus in Medicina conferatur gradus quem illicontucit D , Weurnius ( Med . Prof. ) .1 This work gives a good general account of the disease . It is true that it does not compare in depth and detail with that which Glisson published five years later , and which has for long been accepted as the first description of the disease , but it certainly gives most of the fundamental observations . The more famous Glisson was a Dorsetshire man born , it is thought , in 1597 , who studied at Cambridge , where he took his M.D. in 1634 . He appears to have stayed at Cambridge , where he was appointed Regius Professor of Physic in 1636 , until about 164o when he moved to Colchester and started in practice . He was there during the siege in 1648 , but appears to have left shortly afterwards to settle in London . The classic work which carries his name , De Rachitide sive Morbo Puerili qui vulgo The Rickets dicitur , published in 165o , resulted from the delibera tions of a group of members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand from the introduction that of eight interested doctors three , Dr G. Bate , Dr A. Regemorter and Francis Glisson , were most concerned . It is also quite clear that Glisson contributed so much more to the compila t ion of the information than any of his colleagues that they willingly allowed the book to appear with his name as author . There is a remark in the intro duction which indicates that the self-appointed Committee ( the archives of the Royal College of Physicians contain no reference to the inquiry being carried out officially under their auspices ) had been working for five years , that is , since 1645 , the very year in which Whistler 's Thesis appeared . Sir Norman Moore interpreted this coincidence as evidence that young Whistler had learnt of the project and tried to utilize an imperfect knowledge of the well known but not yet printed discovery of a great scientific investigator ' .2 It is difficult to understand why this biographer reached such a conclusion . Whistler was a native of Walthamstow and must have known London in his youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more than likely that he had seen plenty of rickets and that he knew it to be one of the diseases into which deaths recorded in the Bills of Mortality were classified . It must also be borne in mind that Whistler was residing in Leyden for the best part of the two years before his Thesis was published in 1645 and that it is , // therefore , unlikely that he heard more than a rumour or two , if anything at all , about the project of Glisson and his colleagues . A rather curious point , which weighs in Whistler 's favour , is the strange similarity of the titles of the two books . It is inconceivable that Glisson 's committee had decided on the title of their publication five years before it appeared : there is not sufficient evidence to justify the charge of plagiarism which Sir Norman Moore brought against Whistler . ' On the other hand , it is difficult to dispel the suspicion that Glisson 's interest in a disease which he seems to have known in his native Dorset when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thesis in 1645 . If there were reasons for believing that Whistler stole his ideas from the group of people headed by Glisson it is surprising that no charge was brought against him in De Rachitide : there is no reference in its pages to the Leyden Thesis . Even if this be overlooked ? for , after all , the latter was a foreign publication ? it is less easy to explain why Glisson makes no reference to another description of rickets which appeared in London a year before his own work . In 163o , two brothers , Arnold and Gerard Boate , ' graduated in medicine at Leyden . They were the sons of a Dutch physician who had come to London in 1625 and died there shortly afterwards . His sons practised here with considerable success , for one , Gerard , became Physician in Ordinary to Charles I , while his brother Arnold moved to Dublin and became private physician to Robert Sydney , Earl of Leicester , later establishing a flourishing practice there . Arnold wrote a textbook en-titled Observationes medicae de affectibus omissis which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter , under the heading Tabes Pectorea , he gave a short but concise account of rickets which , he stated was quite com mon both in England and Ireland . It is not reasonable , in the face of these facts , to preserve for Glisson the pre-eminent position he has held for so long as the first person to give the English medical profession a clear descrip tion of rickets . Whistler and Boate , and particularly Whistler , must be given a share of that honour . It is beside the point to contrast Glisson 's subsequent career , in which he proved himself to be a born investigator , with that of Whistler who spent his time building up a fashionable practice in London and trying to climb the social ladder . It is curious how often the clues seem to lead us back to Leyden , at that time one of the most famous of the medical schools of Europe . Whistler was there , three of Glisson 's collaborators , Regemorter ( 1635 ) , Paget ( 1639 ) and Wright ( 1642 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 163o . Is this mere coincidence , or does it mean that those who studied at Leyden about that time learnt of a disease in which the legs of young children were bent by pressure or by walking too soon and that when they returned to England they recognized the condition in a more severe form as that popularly known as rickets ? Further research is needed to throw light on this interesting question , but meanwhile , it is worth mentioning that two famous Dutch physicians , Petrus Forestus ( 1522-97 ) and Johan van Beverwyck ( 1594-1647 ) refer in their writings to the risk of causing young children 's legs to bend if they are allowed to walk too soon . This may mean that rickets was known in Holland in the sixteenth century . The origin of the word rickets is obscure . The derivation which Glisson seemed to favour was from the Greek word for a spine paxls , which became converted into the word paxrrls , and so to rickets . There is no doubt that the Greek physicians knew of bone deformities such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described both by Soranus of Ephesus and by the omniscient Galen , but there is no evidence that any word which might be regarded as the origin of the word rickets was applied to those conditions . Whistler suggested it might have arisen from the word rucket , stated to be a Dorset dialect word meaning to breathe with difficulty , which is probably a form of the word ruckle , of Scandinavian origin , meaning to make a rattling noise in the throat . This is not convincing . An alternative speculation is based on early English words , wrick , wrikken , meaning to twist or sprain . The question remains an open one , except that the evidence leads one to think that the word has a long but unknown English history . Not the least puzzling of many strange points regarding the early history of rickets is the fact that we find the word being used in 1634 as if it were generally known and yet no trace of it is found in earlier writings . Whatever the origin of the word , the medical profession decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stout old Nicholas Culpeper , who never lost an opportunity of baiting the pompous College of Physicians for obscuring their wisdom or their ignorance by using the classic tongues . They were scarcely less angry when he translated Glisson 's De Rachitide into English in 1651 than when earlier he had infuriated them by translating their Pharmacopceia very filthily into English ' , so giving the ordinary person a large amount of information which had previously been available only to those who could read Latin . In his widely read The English Physitian Enlarged which he published in 1653 Culpeper recommended Down ' or Cotton-Thistle ' for rickets , and having Glisson 's recent book in mind , he says it is good for Children that have the Rickets , or rather ( as the Colledg of Physitians wil have it ) the Rachites , for which name for the Disease , they have ( in a particular Treatise lately set forth by them ) Learnedly Disputed , and put forth to publick view , that the // World may see they took much pains to little purpose ' . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The early references to rickets all indicate that it had first attracted attention about 162o . It is also suggested that it first appeared in the west , in Dorset and Somerset , and then gradually spread east and north . To what extent people merely passed on the views of Glisson is uncertain , but at least one non-medical writer stated before De Rachitide was published that the disease appeared early in the century . He was a well-known divine named Thomas Fuller , who compiled a series of tracts published in 1649 , entitled Good Thoughts in Bad Times , Together with Good Thoughts in Worse Times . It is most unlikely that he knew of Whistler 's Thesis or of Arnold Boate 's book , although it is just possible , since he lived in London , that he may have heard something of the deliberations of Glisson and his colleagues . At any rate , in Section XX on Meditation on The Times ' , he says : There is a disease of Infants ( and an Infant-disease , having scarcely as yet gotten a proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Head waxeth too great , whil'st the Legs , and lower parts wain too Little . A woman in the West hath happily healed many , by cauterizing the Vein behind the Ear . How proper the Remedy for the Malady I engage not , experience of times outdoing Art , whil'st we behold the Cure easily effected , and the natural Cause thereof hardly assigned . This gives him an excellent opening to inquire have not many now adayes the same sickness in their souls ? ' and to point a moral to those whose heads are swollen but whose spiritual understanding is weak . One thing is certain , the malady was widespread at this time . Arnold Boate , writing in 1649 , was emphatic that it was common not only in England but also in Ireland . He could at any rate speak with authority of Dublin , and it was certainly his opinion that his brother expressed in his well-known Ireland 's Natural History published posthumously in 1652 ; Gerard had not visited Ireland when the volume was compiled in 1645 . Amongst the reigning diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckoned , a disease peculiar to young children , and so well known to everybody in England , as it is needless to give any description of it . It is very puzzling . The doctors seem to have been satisfied that the disease first appeared in the early part of the century . Yet it was already called by a name which suggests a long popular usage and an Anglo-Saxon origin , and by 1652 it is supposed to be so common and well known that no description // of it is thought necessary in a book intended not for the medical man but for the general reader . What is the explanation ? Rickets must have occurred in England before the early seventeenth century . There were many periods of dearth when thousands upon thousands were half-starved and when every type of nutritional disorder must have been rife . Unfortunately we have no evidence to show the extent to which rickets occurred in these earlier times . It is , however , by no means surprising that the disease became noticeably prevalent at the time of the terrible depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tudors . We have seen that white meats ' , which had been for centuries an important part of the food of the poorer country folk , had become scarce and dear , at any rate in the south . This had the effect of reducing both the calcium and the phosphorus intake , but more particularly the former . A diet consisting of i z pints of milk , 12 lb. of bread and i lb. of dried peas ( which can be taken as a fair estimate of a peasant diet providing about 3000 Cal. ) , would have supplied nearly 2 g. of calcium and 3 g. of phosphorus ( Ca/P ratio 1:1.5 ) . When milk was unobtainable and the 3000 Cal . had to be made up by eating more bread , the calcium intake would have been reduced to perhaps 0.5 g. while the phosphorus would not have been much affected . Apart from any question of the intake of vitamin D , such a reduction in the daily amount of calcium would make one suspect that a rise in the incidence of rickets might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction can cause rickets in animals , a situation that can be combated by vitamin D or sunlight or ultraviolet light . The mechanism of the calcification process is still not fully understood , though it is known that the concentrations of calcium and phosphorus in the serum have an influence on the process , and that vitamin D regulates these concentrations . There are good reasons for believing that a woman living on a diet so poor in calcium would be unable to provide her child with milk fully enriched with bone-forming materials . The consequences might not be obvious until quite late in the nursing period or , indeed , they might not cause trouble until the child began to live on the defective diet of its parents . Glisson commented particularly on the frequency with which the disease appeared in children of from 9 to 18 months , which is the age at which one would expect the highest incidence in a community living on diets poor in calcium and having low calcium/phosphorus ratios . In this connection it is important to remember that the only food many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made with flour and diluted cows ' milk or whey . Glisson has recorded that he found more cases of rickets in the cradles of the rich than of the poor . At first sight it appears unlikely that this was a fact and one is inclined to think that he may have looked more // carefully for the disease among the wealthy than among the poor . It must be remembered , however , that rich people frequently employed wet-nurses chosen from the poorer country folk and that they were quite as ignorant as the poor regarding the right type of diet for the child at weaning . The pea sant 's child usually got cows ' milk in one form or another at this time , if any was available , because it was a convenient food . The educated classes , on the other hand , were influenced by the medical view that milk was only appropriate to infancy and old age and should be discarded soon after wean ing . Very young children were , therefore , often put on to bread , soups and thin gruels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rickets from which little John Verney was probably suffering when his mother sent a letter of home news to her husband in August 1647 . I must give thee some account of our own babyes heare . For Jack his leggs are most miserable , crooked as ever I saw any child 's , and yett thank god he goes very strongly , and is very strayte in his body as any child can bee ; and is a very fine child all but his legges , and truly I think would be much finer if we had him in ordering , for they lett him eate anythinge he hath a mind toe , and he keepes a very ill diett . To which Sir Ralph replied : ... truly the Crookednesse of his Leggs grieves my very Hart , aske some advise about it at London , but doe not Tamper with him.l A year later Dr Denton said of the boy that His swelled leggs and great belly looks so like a dropsy. . . it argues a very weake liver . " In the light of recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infants Dr Denton 's report makes one wonder whether this boy was suffer ing from such a condition . Insufficient protein , particularly if it is of low biological value , on weaning leads inter alia to enlarged and fatty livers , macrocytic anaemia , changes in pigmentation of hair and skin , oedema and often a reduction in the proportion of albumin in the serum.3 Dr Denton 's remark about a very weake liver ' is particularly interesting . This family seems to have suffered rather severely from what was prob ably rickets , although the possibility of tubercular trouble can not be ruled out in the case of the boy Mun , who was sent to Utrecht to be straightened ' by Dr Skatt , a Dutch consultant , who had a great reputation for curing // crooked children ' . His treatment was to strap the wretched lad in a corselet of iron and leather and to release the fastenings only once a week to permit him to change his shirt . When his father asked that he might be permitted to change it twice weekly the learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he could not possibly spare the time to give such special attention to one of them . Glisson regarded diet in relation to rickets solely from the standpoint of the humoral doctrines . The disease , he held , was a cold distemper ' arising from the penury and paucity ' of the spirits and from their stupefaction ' . It was aggravated by cold and moist air and , therefore , following the same line of thought , he condemned cold and moist ' meats . This was in one respect an unfortunate judgment for his ban extendended to fish , which were then thought to be particularly cold and moist ' . The commonest and cheapest fish of those days was herring which , whether salted or pickled , would have provided a valuable supply of vitamin D. Glisson also condemned over-eating , again on humoral grounds . ... for too liberal feeding doth overwhelm and choak the heat , and therefore must needs accumulate many crude and raw humours . ' Later in the century Dr Walter Harris seems to have suspected that the condition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infant , for he remarked that it was particularly likely to occur if she suffered from indigested food ' or ' gripes ' .2 There is no indication in the writings of Whistler , Boate or Glisson that the disease could be cured by dietary means . There is , however , a reference in a letter written by Sir Thomas Browne in 1672 which suggests that a simple remedy , ravens ' liver , was used by the country people near Norwich . Many are killed for their Livers , in order to the cure of the Rickets . ' The interest of this quotation lies in the probability that he is referring to an old household custom in that part of the country , which , in turn , indicates that the disorder had been known there for much more than a generation or two . It is a strange fact that the large modern literature on the distribution of vitamin D in animal foods does not contain a single reference to the amount present in any bird liver . Fish livers are for the most part rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their livers . Whether ravens ' // livers are or are not worthy of the old belief to which Sir Thomas referred can not , therefore , be decided until tests have been made . Throughout the early literature on rickets we find the idea that the liver is involved . Doubtless it arose from the swollen abdomen so often seen in badly rachitic children . Physical examination of the abdomen was very primitive in those days and a distention was nine times out of ten put down to liver trouble ; it was the first thought that came to Dr Denton when he examined the Verney child . The earliest seventeenth-century Bills of Mortality for London do not mention rickets but we find a heading Liver-grown ' , which in later years is bracketed together with rickets , while after 1634 they are listed separately . Capt . John Graunt , one of the founders of the study of vital statistics , tried to determine from these Bills what was the relation between the two conditions and their relative incidence , but careful as was his analysis his conclusions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' who decided upon and recorded the cause of death ) . How worthless are the lists of the Bills of Mortality except for readily identi fiable diseases such as the plague , can be judged from the later records of rickets . Some four to five hundred deaths a year were attributed to the disease in the period 1658-6o when it was certainly prevalent . In the prosperous years about 1725-50 , when the standard of living rose the incidence according to these lists fell to about 30-50 a year . When , however , we come to the dearth and starvation at the end of the eighteenth century we find only about three or four deaths a year recorded , while after 181o , when the rickets was rife among the poor of the industrial towns , no mention is made of it . 5 4 FORMATION OF TEETH It seems certain that the calcification of teeth occurs by a process similar in character to that which leads to the mineralization of bone . Certainly Lady Mellanby , who made experimental studies on teeth parallel with her hus band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sufficient vitamin D grow teeth which are abnormal in structure and im perfectly calcified . The abnormalities range from the worst conditions , in which the tooth is misshapen , discoloured and obviously defective , to those which are so slight that careful microscopic study is needed to reveal them . She drew particular attention to the less obvious defects because she thought they were usually unsuspected or ignored and yet just as likely to lead to tooth decay as the grosser faults : microscopic fissures harbour bacteria and food residues and eventually give rise to cavities . Lady Mellanby , having // satisfied herself that the whole range of defects she had detected in experi mental animals is commonly found in children 's teeth , planned and super vised an extensive investigation to ascertain whether the addition of vitamin D in the form of cod liver oil to the diet of young school children would arrest the spread of dental caries . Taken as a whole the results were en couraging . Over the whole spell of about seven years the vitamin D therapy significantly reduced the spread of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it produced less effect than had been expected on teeth erupted before treatment began . ' 5 5 DENTAL CARIES Ever since Miller2 showed that certain bacteria growing in solutions of starch and sugars produce acidic substances which can dissolve the enamel of teeth , many dentists have considered that this provides a satisfactory explanation of ordinary dental caries . According to them food residues col lect round the teeth , particularly in the crevices between them and at the margins of the gums ? and it must be remembered that this is where caries usually starts ? and become fermented by bacteria , with the production of acids which slowly erode the hard enamel surface . An obvious objection to this very simple theory is that it does not account for the perfect teeth which are found in many native races whose diet is rich in starchy foods and who pay little or no attention to the cleanliness of their mouths . The West Indian native under his natural conditions has excellent teeth , although from the time he is a little child he loves to chew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the towns and adopt the living habits of the white man their teeth , or , at any rate , those of their children , decay . If one makes a compilation of the distribution of dental caries related to changes in diet the most striking correlation appears where modern white flour and sugar are concerned . Time and time again examples will be found of com munities in which the teeth were generally excellent so long as the people lived on natural unrefined foodstuffs . Soon after the introduction of the highly milled modern type of white flour caries appeared . One such isolated community is of particular interest because the state of the teeth has been kept under expert observation during a period when the character of the diet has changed . It is the small population of the remote island of Tristan da Cunha . When H.M.S. Carlisle , surveying the Southern Atlantic , called in 1932 , the ship 's surgeon took the opportunity to examine // the teeth of the 162 inhabitants . They were remarkably good , 83 per cent being entirely free from caries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under five years of age . At that time the diet was essentially the same as it had been for many years , potatoes , fish , eggs , a little milk and vegetables , with hardly any cereals . Only when a ship called , a rare event , was there an opportunity to obtain a little white flour and sugar . Breast feeding was universal and toothbrushes were unknown . ' H.M.S. Carlisle paid another visit to the island in 1937 and the teeth were again examined . Caries was more apparent than it had been five years before ; indeed , the spread was rather alarming . In so short a space of time the percentage of persons with wholly sound teeth had dropped to 5o per cent . Moreover , the striking fact was revealed that the young children were most affected and mainly responsible for the rise in the figures of incidence . There was only one change in the mode of living of the islanders with which the deterioration of the teeth can be correlated . It had been exceptional for the island to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Between the middle of 1933 and early 1937 no less than ten ships called , and the people had quantities of white flour and sugar such as they had never seen before ; incidentally , they had also received their first toothbrushes . ' The teeth of the islanders have been examined on several other occasions during the last thirty years . Royal Naval dental officers took part in the two surveys already mentioned , a third in 1952 , and another in 1955 , and the results of these four surveys were compared in the report of the last one . ' The percentage of persons entirely free from caries and extractions had fallen from the 83 per cent of 1932 and the 50 per cent of 1937 to 22 per cent in 1952 and , even further , to 12 per cent in 1955 . The percent-age with healthy gums had decreased steeply from 96 in 1932 to 69 in 1937 , more slowly to 58 in 1952 and then more sharply again to 48 in 1955 . Al-though the basic diet in 1955 was still stated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed fundamentally by the opportunity of buy ing processed and refined foods from the Tristan Development Company 's Canteen . In the first half of 1955 , quantities of foods were purchased which would have been equivalent if expressed per head per week to roughly 42 lb. of flour ( including small quantities of biscuits and rice ) and 2 lb. of sugar and jam ( including a little canned fruit and sweets ) , as well as about a third of a can of milk . Lady Mellanby was certainly right in thinking that there is need for vitamin D in infancy and childhood to help to form the substance of sound teeth but one does not find a good correlation between vitamin D intake and // the distribution of caries in world populations . Nowhere is caries more rife than in New Zealand , a country of exceptionally high average standard of living , with a large per caput consumption of butter and where the atmo sphere is for a good part of the year clear and sunny : the consumption of sugar , sweets , cake and biscuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both in New Zealand and Great Britain found more sets of sound teeth among the slum children of Birmingham than in well-to-do and middle-class families in New Zealand . ' The Maoris , however , are immune so long as they keep to their native diets . When they come to the towns and adopt the white man 's mode of living their teeth deteriorate . It is a striking fact that meat-eating races very rarely show carious teeth . The teeth of the carnivorous Masai warriors were perfect , even if their oral hygiene left much to be desired , whereas those of their sickly neighbours , the Akikuyu , who lived almost exclusively on millet , maize , sweet potatoes and yams , were rather badly affected.2 This was probably related to the calcium and phosphorus contents of their respective diets , for whereas the former is rich in both and reasonably well balanced ( estimated male intake , 2.94 g. calcium , 4.36 g. phosphorus ) that of the latter is calcium-poor and exception-ally badly proportioned ( estimated male intake , 0.28 g. calcium , 3.0 g. phosphorus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the causes and prevention of dental caries , though there is no doubt that there is a strong association between diet and tooth decay . The subject was recently reviewed for the National Research Council of the United States of America , 3 and some of the more important conclusions reached are : Poorly formed and poorly calcified teeth seem to be more susceptible to caries than normal teeth . Vitamin D supplements reduce caries activity if the diet is short of this vitamin . There is no evidence of an increased tooth decay in vitamin C deficiency , though shortage of this vitamin causes impairment of the supporting structures of the teeth , and consequent loss of teeth and gum infections . ( This observa tion accords with the old records on scurvy . ) There is no incontrovertible evidence that diets partially deficient in calcium or phosphorus or both result in increased caries , but the ability to utilize and retain calcium and phosphorus seems to be important . It is not known whether there is a relationship be tween the sugar and refined carbohydrate content of an adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries where sugar supplies // were restricted during World Wars I and II there were reductions in the incidence of tooth decay , which did not reach its lowest point until sugar had been restricted for six or more years . Fluorine in moderate amounts affords a significant degree of protection against caries . 5 6 STATE OF EARLY ENGLISH TEETH Perfection in teeth is by no means common today in civilized com munities but it is very often seen among native races . Each jaw carries a set of perfectly aligned and formed teeth and if the individual is in the thirties or older it will be seen that the surfaces are worn down with chewing . This attrition causes a reaction in the healthy tooth by which more hard bony material , secondary dentine , is constantly being laid down to protect and to prevent exposure of the soft interior . In this manner a hard surface is maintained which does not crack or wear thin . In the jaws of an old person the grinding teeth may be worn down almost level with the gums , the sur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little evidence about the state of the teeth in England at different periods by examining skulls which can be dated with some certainty , but , unfortunately , there is not a great deal of this material available . The task is made more difficult by the fact that teeth readily drop out of the skull in the course of time . It is important , therefore , in examining the jaws of old skulls to note whether gaps represent teeth lost during or after life . They are quite easy to distinguish , because when a tooth is lost during lifetime the bone of the jaw gradually grows and covers over the socket . An open socket in an old skull or jawbone means , therefore , that the tooth was either lost very shortly before death or that it dropped out afterwards . The vaults of St Leonard 's Church , Hythe , have given us material repre senting the population of that seaport between the approximate dates 1250 to 165o . The examination of 199 complete palates showed that approximately half had not lost a single tooth before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfaces of well-worn teeth . Carious cavities were present in some of the teeth but a statistical examination of the jaws for this defect was not made.l The general statement is permissible that it was a good deal less prevalent than it is today . The evidence becomes a little clearer when we reach the seventeenth-century material because some of it can be dated with more certainty . A collection of mandibles from a burial ground in Farringdon Street showed that 26 per cent of the males and 14.5 // per cent of the females had lost no teeth before death . It will be seen that the percentage is lower than that shown by the Hythe skulls and compares unfavorably with the high figures ( 80.6 per cent for males and 72.2 per cent for females ) which examination of the Australian aborigines reveals . Loss of teeth before death does not necessarily mean caries . We have already mentioned the prevalence of scurvy and of the less obvious pre-scorbutic conditions in England during these centuries . It is not surprising , therefore , to find numerous references to loosened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom mentioned but now and again one comes across a remedy to be inserted in a hollow tooth to relieve the pain . One passage taken from Paul Hentzner 's account of his visit to England in 1598 suggests that bad teeth were fairly common at that time among those who could afford to indulge a taste for sweetmeats . He gives a good descrip tion of the visit of Queen Elizabeth to the Royal Palace of Greenwich , when he had a close view of her . He remarks on her hooked nose , her narrow hips and , particularly , on her black teeth , with the comment that it was a defect the English seem subject to , from their too great use of sugar ' .1 It rather looks as if this was a popular view , even at this date , and that it had arisen from the observation that the rich suffered more than the poor and that an obvious difference between their diets was the relatively large amount of sweetmeats which the former could afford . The immoderate vse thereof , and also of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . rotteth the teeth , maketh them look blacke. z The only quantitative information we have about the incidence of caries is that derived by Sir Frank Colyer from the study of material dug up from a burial ground in the City of London , most of which dates from the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries . ' He estimated that the skulls had originally held just over 6800 teeth , of which nearly 3500 were in situ , while another 2500 had been lost after death . This shows that about 15 per cent of the teeth had been lost during life . Of the surviving teeth some io per cent were carious , but this figure is not a true indication of the distribu tion because of 103 bad teeth in skulls with mandibles attached no less than 50 were present in 4 specimens . It is not easy to compare these figures with modern estimates , because the latter are based almost exclusively on the examination of young children , but they indicate very strongly that caries was much less common in the seventeeth century than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
