Not in a generation had a Broadway season counted up to so few shows . There were only 52 during 1949-50 . The downpour of financial backing available for wartime producing had been cut by production costs to a light drizzle . As almost all shows found it harder to get to Broadway , so the doubtful ones found it harder to linger there until the public could judge them . But it was not wholly a matter for lamentation ; rare this season were those exhibits of unutterable drivel that had once turned up every week . <P> The Good Points . Unhappily , 1949-50 did not make up in brilliance for what it lacked in bulk . The most that could be said was that it had its good points and incidental graces and one or two peak moments . However controversial in theme , T. S. Eliot 's The Cocktail Party offered the best new stage writing in years . And though Carson McCullers ' The Member of the Wedding ( winner of the Critics ' Award ) might have trouble proving itself a play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing . Better still , both these very individual works , like such recent others as A Streetcar Named Desire , Death of a Salesman and The Madwoman of Chaillot , became genuine box-office hits . <P> In a season whose musicomedies were resolutely undistinguished , musical drama - the one new form to establish itself on Broadway-strengthened its hold . Gian-Carlo Menotti 's smash hit The Consul ( along with The Cocktail Party had every cocktail party in Manhattan buzzing . Marc Blitzstein 's Regina died at the boxoffice , but it was very much alive on the stage . <P> The Glaring Lack . What hobbled the season was less a lack of aspiration than ( as the New York Times 's Critic Brooks Atkinson and others noted ) a glaring lack of creativeness . Broadway swam with revivals ( Shakespeare , Shaw , Strindberg Peter Pan ) , with books made into plays ( The Member of the Wedding , The Innocents , The Happy Time , Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep ) with plays and books made into musicals ( Regina , Lost in the Stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sofas rather than building them outright , Broadway still scorned the idea that the play 's the thing and whooped up the production . <P> Box-office activity topped 1948-49 and was reasonably good . In its second year , South Pacific remained the biggest-in fact the alltime biggest-hit on Broadway . Hollywood , having sat with folded hands the season before , dug down into its jeans for more than $1,000,000 , paying $350,000 plus a percentage for A Streetcar Named Desire , $285,000 plus a percentage for Detective Story . Without much to look back on in 1949-50 , Broadway could at least look forward to being in business in 1950-51.
