The first big layoffs because of shortages and prospective war production began to threaten U.S. industry . Nash-Kelvinator Corp . announced that by Jan. 15 it would cut back 18% of its work force , or 4,500 employees , and slash auto production by 25% . Because of other cutbacks in the auto industry , Michigan expected that the state 's unemployment total , which had jumped by 13,000 to 65,000 in the latest week , would hit 150,000 by summer . <P> The danger of mass layoffs finally seemed big enough to speed up Washington 's snail-slow letting of war contracts . A $100 million contract for military trucks was given to General Motors Corp. , and a $160 million contract for medium tanks to Chrysler Corp. , its biggest contract to date .

But production probably would not begin for many months , since Chrysler planned to build a new plant near Newark , Del. to make the tanks . <P> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aircraft Co. was negotiating with the Air Force and the Boeing Airplane Co. to build B-47 jet bombers in an idle Government plane plant in Tulsa , Okla . It would be the first time since World War II that any company other than Boeing has produced Boeing planes - but Douglas would not be able to get into production for 18 months at least . Kaiser-Frazer Corp . was dickering to build Fairchild C-119 transports at Willow Run ; even General Motors was said to have a deal cooking to build Republic F-84 jet fighters . <P> More material shortages for civilian users-and probably more layoffs-were in the cards . Last week the National Production Authority ordered a 20% cutback in the civilian use of tin for February , said it would again cut the supply of vital cobalt for the radio and television industry . From General Electric Co. ' s new President Ralph J. Cordiner came a hint of how much war production would be stepped up in the future . Said he : G.E. , whose production is already 22% in war goods , would boost the proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
