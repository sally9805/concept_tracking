txt The curtain will descend tomorrow night on the New Jersey Governorship campaign . The contest  --  on the surface , at least ? appears to have been enacted before a relatively bored audience . Neither Gov . Robert B. Meyner , the Democratic incumbent , nor State Senator Malcolm S. Forbes , the Republican candidate , has exhibited the ability to rouse the voting public markedly from its apparent apathy . Beyond the Hudson and , the Delaware , however , far greater interest is berg manifested in the contest . The Eisenhower Administration has staked its prestige on the results of the balloting as never before in a state-wide race . Republicans and Democrats alike at the national level are eagerly awaiting the vote tally . Each party hopes to gain from it a trend in its favor . Surprise Possible The apparent lack of interest locally may well be misleading . It is not an uncommon trait of the state 's electorate , as witness 1953 , 1954 and 1956 . In those years , the pre-election temper turned out to be a " sleeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point , set their alarms for election morn and flocked to the polls . As the present campaign progressed , it became increasingly evident that , in all probability , it would be decided on the basis of personality rather than on issues . This was verified by a team of New York Times reporters in the fie:d . On the basis of findings of The Times ' survey team , victory for Mr. Meyner is definitely indicated . Should the vote be light , there is evidence that his margin will be well under 100,000 . Relatively heavy balloting , on the other hand , could produce for Mr. Meyner a margin of landslide proportions . Paradoxically , there is every indication at this writing that , when the ballots are counted , Mr. Meyner will show surprising strength in such normally Republican strongholds as Essex , Bergen , Union and Monmouth Counties , as well as in much of South Jersey . There is evidence that this strength will be more than sufficient to offset the relatively low Democratic plurality anticipated in Hudson County , normally a party bastion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders of both parties , of impartial and normally reliable observers and of persons in the street who were interviewed at random . Following is an analysis of the campaign , the issues and of the local situations that may have a profound bearing on the balloting . The analysis is the result of an exhaustive weeklong , state-wide survey by a team of six Times reporters . As the aspirant , Senator Forbes has sought to convince the voting public that Mr. Meyner should be removed . To accomplish this goal , Mr. Forbes has relied heavily upon support from Washington and Negro ire over Little Rock . He has stressed the Governor 's record budgets , charging that they result from " payroll padding and waste " and must " inevitably lead " to a state sales or income levy . Mr. Forbes also has accused the state of unnecessarily delaying the prosecution of an insurance official charged with embezzling funds , from a firm he headed . He has characterized this delay as a " major scandal . " The 38-year-old Senator from Somerset County has further bitterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accused the Governor of being " a tool . " Mr. Meyner has based his campaign on a strong defense of Mr. Forbes ' charges and a counter-accusation that his opponent 's election would bring similar broad-based taxes . Senator Forbes is by no means without political assets . As a legislator and as publisher of Forbes magazine , he has won many friends and the respect of citizens in all twenty-one counties . On the debit side , however , the survey discloses his apparent inability to convince enough voters that Mr. Meyner should be replaced and the absence of monetary support for his party 's effort . Senator Forbes is beset also by some factionalism within his party at the state and county levels . Interviews with hundreds of voters failed to show that the endorsement of Senator Forbes by the President or the campaigning on his behalf by Vice President Richard M. Nixon and many top Administration officials would gain for the candidate a measurable number of votes . To bolster his spending issue , Senator Forbes induced the Republican-controlled State Legislature to reduce the Governor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut deprived thousands of state employes and teachers of an expected salary increment ana Rutgers University of a new biology building and law center . The budget cuts , together with an exhaustive Democratic registration drive in Middlesex , are expected by observers to make that county the party 's banner area this year . Mr. Meyner carried the county in 1953 by a plurality of 31,907 . As in the north and central counties , there appeared little desire among the voters in South Jersey to change the occupants in the State House . Moving northward across the state , the team found few , if any , signs that the Governor had lost any marked support in the areas that elected him , four years ago . He appeared , on the basis of the , team 's interviews , to have picked up strength in Essex , where nearly one-fifth of the state 's populace lives , and in Morris and Passaic Counties In 1953 Mr. Meyner carried New Jersey by a plurality of 153,642 votes .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
