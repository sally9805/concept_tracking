Henry Koerner 's meticulous realism strikes a lot of moderns as just a throwback to 19th Century genre painting . But since art moves in cycles , it may really represent an advance . Koerner obviously thinks so ; the only question he asks himself is how to consolidate his advance . <P> Though he paints people and things he sees , Koerner assembles them to suit himself on carefully planned canvases . No one could fail to appreciate the competence of Koerner 's last exhibition ( TIME , March 27 ) , but many complained of its tightness and dryness along with its general atmosphere of gloomy obscurity . His new paintings , on view in a Manhattan gallery last week , suffer less noticeably from such faults . <P> " This year , " Koerner says , " I dragged my canvases everywhere to do everything on the spot . It 's amazing how easily you forget reality , and how much richer reality is . Instead of painting just people I made them real portraits , I tried very hard for likenesses . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of his few cheerful pictures , Henry does . It also shows Koerner 's growing independence of involved , story-telling props . The children 's airplane swing on which the figure poses might be taken to symbolize the young showoff side of any artist 's make-up as well as the realist 's happy lot-which is to go around looking . The jar of fish he totes with him might symbolize almost anything . But those two props do not make the painting , or even intrude on it too much . <P> Studying nature , not imitating modern masters , is Koerner 's method , and straightforwardness , not forcefulness , appears to be his goal . In painting , that looks easy and comes hard .
