 | Missiles Replace the Navy 's Big Guns THE United States , world 's greatest sea power , is building a guided-missile Navy . Missile launchers , instead of gun turrets , arm our latest fighting ships . Britain is following our lead , as other navies doubtless will . Big guns , the final arbiters at Jutland , at Surigao Strait and in other classical sea battles of the past , may have thundered for the last time in a great naval engagement . Their arching shellfire may well be superseded by rocket- and jet-propelled missiles , steered to targets by radar . Only yesterday , massively armored " ships of the line " steamed into battle in majestic procession . Today there is no battle line . Dispersed miles apart by the threat of nuclear weapons , carriers and cruisers of fast task forces will hurl missiles at targets far beyond gun range . What the Navy calls its first combatant missile @# PRINCIPLE of " beam-rider " guidance system applied by Terrier missile is shown here . Ship 's antenna , following target , projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which steers it to target . This " local " system serves primarily for defense ; longer-range missiles , for attack .  | ship , the guided-missile cruiser Boston , joined the Atlantic Fleet early this year . Formerly a conventional 13,600-ton heavy cruiser with three gun turrets , it has been radically remodeled . Two missile launchers have replaced its after gun turret . The two forward turrets , each with three eight-inch guns , remain . A sister ship , the Canberra , is undergoing conversion to the same hybrid armament . These cruisers , and some of the guided-missile ships of various types on the way , fire the rocket-propelled Terrier " surface-toair , " or antiaircraft , missile . Other U. S. warships , meanwhile , have been adapted to launch the Regulus surface-to-surface missile . This has required so little alteration that the vessels have not even been formally redesignated as " missile ships . " Essentially a pilotless jet plane , the Regulus has been designed for use against shore targets and surface craft . Now the Navy 's 1957 construction pro-@# @# gram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first surface ship propelled by atomic power . It will have unlimited range , and will cruise at a sustained high speed that would rapidly use up conventional fuel . An atomic-propelled , missile-firing submarine scheduled in the same program foreshadows our future undersea craft . The Navy is farther along with guided missiles than most people realize . For shipboard use it now has four kinds of missiles : the Terrier and Regulus , already in quantity production , and the still newer Talos and Tartar . To fire them , missile ships of many types are built and building : submarines , de-@#  | stroyers , frigates , light and heavy cruisers , and aircraft carriers . And these are but prototypes for many more to come . This country has an unusual opportunity to acquire so ultramodern a fleet , without the costly waste of scrapping " under-age " but outmoded vessels . Huge numbers of U. S. warships mass-produced during World War II will soon become " over-age " and due for replacement ? first submarines , then destroyers , then cruisers and carriers . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 , 16 and 20 years respectively . ) Underscoring the need to replace them is the challenge of Russia 's navy , already the world 's second largest @# and rapidly growing . A big building program , normally coming up , will thus give the U. S. a sizable fleet of brandnew warships . Our naval planners are pushing development of designs to make them the last word . ' A visitor to the guided-missile cruiser Boston sees the pioneering example of the new Navy . Needle-nosed Terrier missiles , pointed skyward in their launchers , give this ship a silhouette new to naval ' observers . On towers that rise just forward of the missiles are the bowl-shaped radar antennas that guide them in flight . Aboard the Boston , a close-hand view of the blue-and-gold missiles reveals their formidable size . A Terrier has the JULY 1956 123  | girth of a big naval shell and stands twice as tall as a man . A rocket " booster " starts the missile on its way , and then drops off . Hidden within the missile itself are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for steering ; and the explosive warhead , with a fuse that detonates it when the missile comes within effective range of the target . With boosters attached , Terriers hang in pairs on recently developed missile launchers ? something new in naval armament . A launcher 's central column revolves like a turret , and twin arms pivot on a massive crossbar , to aim the missiles in any direction . Launchers are operated , and Terriers fired , by remote control from below deck . A finger 's touch on a firing trigger sends a Terrier screaming aloft . To reload an emptied launcher , its twin arms tilt to vertical position . Through opened deck hatches , missiles are elevated from a magazine directly below by loading mechanisms nicknamed " coke machines . " The rising missiles engage guide rails on the launching arms . Then the arms swing back into firing position It 's no secret that the supersonic Terrier uses a " beam-rider " guidance system , developed by the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University . In principle it works like this : Broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning of enemy aircraft . Air patrols speed to intercept them . But suppose a hostile plane somehow eludes interception , and continues approaching . At a certain point in its flight it becomes " of interest " to the Boston 's missile battery . Automatic devices begin tracking it . Indicators tell its speed and altitude . Evaluating the data , the missileers decide what they want to fire , and in what sequence . Finally the radar beam of the missile-aiming director is swung to the target and locked on it . From then on . the turretlike missile launcher automatically turns and tilts its arms to follow the hostile plane 's course , and missiles may be fired at will . A Terrier is launched into the radar beam . At more than twice the speed of sound , it rides the beam on a collision course to the target . It has been reported effective against planes at altitudes up to more than 60,000 feet . The Boston 's missile battery , its officers confidently hold , surrounds the ship with a zone of invulnerability to air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terrier 's range . which is the Navy 's secret . Judging from a Johns Hopkins scientist 's published calculations for a hypothetical but similar missile , it may be nearly 20 miles . If so , one guided-missile cruiser of the Boston class will shield an area of some 1,000 square miles from hostile aircraft . Standing offshore in support of an amphibious landing , it could extend a protective " umbrella " while a beachhead was established . One or more guided-missile cruisers accompanying other ships of a ' task force could provide an antiaircraft screen for all . A high-explosive warhead , with-which the Terrier can be fitted , gives it a punch far more powerful than that of any antiaircraft shell ? and ample to deal with solitary planes or with small groups of them . Envisioning a future naval task force , Assistant Secretary for Air James H. Smith Jr . recently predicted , " Nuclear warheads would be available for missiles fired against large bomber formations . " Does the Boston have atomic Terriers in its magazines ? The Navy is n't saying ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be prepared @#  | for any contingency that might arise . The surface-to-surface Regulus missile arms the heavy cruisers Los Angeles and Helena and will soon be in use by the Macon ? all sister ships of the Terrierarmed Boston and Canberra . Submarines and carriers , too , have been equipped to fire the Regulus . This seven-ton , 32-foot jet missile has wings of 21-foot span and reputed transonic speed . A jet-propelled Regulus obviously can strike at a target hundreds of miles away ; an unofficial estimate of 500 miles looks reasonable . This compares with an extreme range of about 23 miles for the biggest naval guns . That a Regulus fired at an enemy warship would carry a nuclear warhead can be taken for granted . In this day it would be nonsense to fit it with an armorpiercing nose , load it with conventional explosive and try for a direct hit . With an atomic Regulus , a near-miss is good enough to dispose of the target . The classical contest between projectiles and armor ended , with both the losers , when Bikini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For bombarding shore fortifications and inland targets , presumably the Regulus would likewise unleash a nuclear blast . Since the Regulus strikes far beyond range of effective control from the launching vessel , its guidance system must differ from that of shorter-range missiles . While the Navy reveals no details , the principles of long-range missile guidance have been clearly made public : Preset before launching , a Regulustype missile could guide itself to a target of known direction and distance , much as German " buzz bombs " of World War II did . A magnetic compass or gyro would keep it on course . An air-driven indicator , roughly registering distance covered , would tell when it was over the target ? and send it plunging to earth . Thus a lone submarine , surfacing offshore , could rain havoc upon an inland enemy base . For more precise guidance , @# .  | attacking ships could project a radio grid such as Loran or Shoran over the target area , enabling the . missile to navigate itself to the target 's exact latitude and longitude . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , presumably would require a homing device built into the missile . This device would take over the missile 's guidance when it approached the target . The missile could " home " on the heat radiation from the vessels ? or could pinpoint them with a radar beam of its own . To defend themselves against such an attack , warships could be expected to use missile-intercepting countermissiles . Presumably the Navy 's Terrier would chase and destroy jet missiles as effectively as it would jet planes ? and so would two surface-to-air weapons developed even more recently . A new antiaircraft missile , the Talos , reportedly is a super-Terrier with more than twice the range of its predecessor . The cruiser Galveston will be the first to employ it . Coming destroyers will be armed with the Navy 's " baby " Tartar missile , likewise an antiaircraft weapon . Smaller than the Terrier , it dispenses with a booster rocket , but reaches all-altitudes at which present-day jet bombers fly . It will replace the five-inch guns of a conventional destroyer , and of the secondary battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships , the air-to-surface Petrel rounds out the family of missiles revealed by the Navy to date .
