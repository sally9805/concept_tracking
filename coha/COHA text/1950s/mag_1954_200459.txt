Flocks of robins flew up from the sycamore branches . A male and female American merganser were flushed from the riverbank and swooped over the valley . Purple finches bustled in the branches . The call of the titmouse was clear from the field . The spice bushes were in bud , and along the banks of the Potomac the willows were greening . Red maple was already painting the woods . From the bog water in the old unused canal came the song of peeper frogs . <P> This bit of pastoral reporting marked a considerable change of pace for a TIME correspondent whose stories usually originate from places such as Washington 's Federal Reserve Building , the Reconstruction Finance Corporation or the President 's Council of Economic Advisers . The author of the paragraph is George Bookman , business and economics reporter in TIME 'S Washington office , who recently covered one of the capital 's most pleasant news assignments : Supreme Court Justice William 0 . Douglas ' 178-mile hike along the old Chesapeake &; Ohio Canal . <P> The story began with a good-natured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the canal was a good idea , and Justice Douglas , who thought otherwise and suggested that a hike along the route might prove his point ( TIME , March 29 ) . Reporter Bookman was one of 37 white-collar workers , nature lovers and reporters who joined Justice Douglas on his venture . There were no invitations - anyone was welcome to tag along . Bookman got his walking orders on a Thursday morning . When the teletypewriter began rattling out the week 's news queries from New York , one query asked for a reporter to go along on the hike . Said Bookman , who had just finished a 60-page file on an economic story : " For some antic reason my pulse quickened . " He asked for the assignment . Bureau Chief Jim Shepley agreed , and off rushed Bookman to buy the proper equipment ( including long underwear , a sleeping bag , air mattress and first-aid kit ) . <P> The plan was for the hikers to take a train to the canal terminus in Cumberland , Md. and walk from there to Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cumberland , Bookman and fellow walkers arrived at the Woodmont Rod &; Gun Club , where they were to spend the night and where a TIME courier was waiting to take Bookman 's copy to the nearest telegraph office . This done , Bookman relaxed and followed a home-remedy suggestion to ease aching muscles : he drank a tumbler of heavy saltwater solution . The next night , by the time he had bedded down under a pine tree , the muscles felt fine . After one more day , Bookman reluctantly left the hiking party in time to reach his office for Wednesday morning story conference . <P> Back in Washington ( without a single blister ) . Bookman decided that this particular assignment had been one of the most pleasant interludes in his reporting career . Said he : " Sitting around a campfire spooning beef stew from a bubbling cauldron and singing songs in the firelight was one of the best soul-restorers an economics reporter could possibly find .
