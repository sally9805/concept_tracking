The Beginning of the end : Patterson gets set to throw a punch that floored Archie Moore in their 1956 fight for the world heavyweight title . Floyd Patterson has eight brothers and two sisters . He is a product of the crowded Bedford  --  Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and of the Wiltwyck School , at Esopus , New York , and P.S. 614 , in Manhattan , both of which deal with maladjusted children . He enunciates clearly , but speaks so softly that I had to lean toward him to hear what he was saying . " Were you scared ? " I asked . " I was frightened , " he said . " The gym  --  nasium was filled with guys . I mean there was hardly enough space to walk around , there were so many guys up here  --  heavyweights , light-heavyweights  --  most of them pretty big fellas . When I first walked in , all three heavy bags were being punched . Guys were boxing , jumping ropes , hitting the speed bag , shadow  --  boxing . It did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become the heavyweight champion of the world . He on the title  --  the youngest ever to do so  --  on November 30 , 1956 , when he knocked out Archie Moore in five rounds . In defense of his crown he has stopped Tommy ( Hurricane ) Jackson in ten rounds , Pete Rademacher in six and Roy Harris in twelve . " So how does a fighter conquer fear of fighting ? " I asked . " You once told me that , in the amateurs , you were scared when you had to fight a heavyweight named Julius Griffin . Now you 're able to sleep in your dressing room before a fight . " " I was only a middleweight then , " he said , " and he was weighing about one hundred ninety-five pounds and had tremendous muscles . I was so scared that , when that man came next to mc , I never threw punches in all my life as fast as I did then . I jumped up in the air , and before I hit the floor I hit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . " " Have you ever been scared going into a fight since then ? " " Not like I was that night . A certain amount of nervousness rises over mc , because you wort-der whether you 're going to win or lose . If you think of losing , ( Continued on Page .59 ) you get nervous , so you think of winning and you feel good . " " When you lint came to this gym , " I said , " how much money might you have had in your pocket ? " " I doubt very much whether I had over fifteen cents , " Floyd replied . " When I started to train here myself , I used to have to get the carfare from my mother . " " How much cash do you suppose you have in your pocket now ? " " I 'd say between eighty and a hundred dollars . " " Do you carry a checkbook too ? " " Yes , I do . " " As a hungry kid , did you think you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a checkbook ? " " I never dreamt that day would come , " he said , smiling . " Now that you 're in one of the higher income brackets , " I said , " have you ever sat down to figure out what you 're worth ? Do you know , for example , what you yourself got out of the Harris fight after expenses and taxes ? " " Well , I got a guarantee of a quarter of a million dollars , and we gave Harris a guarantee of a hundred thousand , but I neversit down and try to figure it out . I 've got honest people in my organization . " In the more than two years that he has held the title , Patterson has been the least publicized of the modern heavyweight champions . He has overcome the shyness and emotional instability that made him a problem child , but he prefers to avoid attention . At the same time , his manager , Cus D'Amato , has been carrying on a cru  --  sade against the International Boxing Club , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past ten years but now , following a Supreme Court de  --  cision , must disband . As a result , Patter  --  son has not fought as often as his prede  --  cessors . The usual publicity outlets have not been open to him , and many questions concerning him have gone unanswered . " I wonder , " I said to him now , " how you 've been spending your time since you fought Harris . That was on August eighteenth . " " Well , " he said , thinking , " I came home , and I do n't believe I went any  --  where for a month . I stayed around the house , listening to records and watching television . My wife and I did a lot of shopping , and we 'd go to the movies . " He lives with his wife , their two-year-old daughter and his wife 's mother in a home he owns in Saint Albans , Queens . They also spend some time with his par  --  ents and his younger brothers and sisters in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What television shows do you enjoy ? " I said . " Mostly the Westerns , " he said . " I watch Gunsmoke and Have Gun , Will Travel . " " What kind of a movie will draw you out'of the house ? " " Good Westerns , good murder pic  --  tures . " " What do you do about keeping in shape ? " " Well , a month after the fight I came back down to the gym here and resumed training for a couple of weeks . Then went away to look for a camp for about a week and a half . After that I came back , and I 've been going steady here ever since . " " How much time do you spend training each day ? " " That depends on how I feel . Some days I spend just an hour . Some days I spend as much as two and a half or three hours . " " Do you do road work now ? " " I run every Saturday and Sunday . Eventually I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four miles . There 's a park out there called Cunningham . " " Do you run early in the morning ? " " Well , I have to get up early . Up in camp sometimes I do n't get up until six-thirty or seven o'clock , but here in the city I like to get out before the people get up . I get up about five-thirty , so when I come back , with my bumpy clothes on and everything , wo n't nobody see me leave or come in . " " I know you watch fights on TV , " I said , " but you have n't attended any fights since you 've been champion . " " That 's right . I wanted to go when Tony Anthony fought Archie Moore and to the Rohinson-Basilio fights . But if I 'm sitting up near ringside or some  --  where in the arena , people wiU be asking me questions all during the fight and , well , I just would n't enjoy it . " " I suppose you try to avoid being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're eating out ? " " Yes , because I like to laugh if some  --  thing is funny . When someone is always watching you  --  every time 1 eat , every mouthful , and every time I laugh or some  --  thing like that  --  well , it just takes all the fun away . " " In other words , " 1 said , " being cham  --  pion limits your freedom . " " That 's right , " he said , " but although I do n't like it , I 'd do it all over again . " " But have n't you at any time derived a real pleasure from being recognized as the heavyweight champion ? " " After 1 won the championship , it would make me feel good . Before then , people would say , ' There goes Floyd Patterson . ' Now when they see me , they say , ' There goes Floyd Patterson , the heavyweight champion of the world . ' " " Do you ever wake up in the morning and say to yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any man in the world ' ? Is that ever a conscious thought ? " " Well , " he said , thinking again , " I wake up and 1 feel like the heavyweight champion of the world . I do n't say I can lick everybody in the world , though , be  --  cause 1 have to fight them first . I do n't consider myself a great champion yet , be  --  cause I have n't proved it . " " Let 's consider the heavyweight con  --  tenders , " 1 said . " Taking those we 've seen in this country first , I 'd like to know what you think of Nino Valdes , Zora Folley , Willie Pastrano and Eddie Machen . " " I think Machen is a very hard puncher , " he said . " He boxes quite well , but I think Folley is a much better boxer than Machen is . Willie Pastrano , I think , has tremendous speed , very fast speed . And Valdes  --  although he looks like he ca n't fight because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's always dan  --  gerous . I have respect for every one of them . " " What about lngemar Johansson ? " 1 said . " You must have seen him when you were both in the Olympics in Helsinki in 1952 . " That was the year that Patterson won the Olympic middleweight title . Johans  --  son , from Goteborg , Sweden , was dis  --  qualified in the heavyweight competition for " not trying " against Ed Sanders , the American who went on to win the gold medal  --  and who subsequently died as a result of head injuries in a 1954 profes  --  sional fight . Meanwhile , Johansson has won all of his twenty-one professional fights , thirteen by knockouts , to become the European heavyweight champion . When he knocked out Macho " in one round in Sweden last September , he be  --  came the top-ranking challenger for Pat  --  terson 's title . " It 's over six years ago , " Patterson said now , " and 1 do n't recall specifically how Johansson looked . Ed Sanders then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was a tremendous man and everybody was scared of him . I ca n't recall exactly how Johansson looked . " " Have you seen the film of his fight with Eddie Machen ? " " No. 1 had the chance , but I 'm not curious to see it . Sometimes it 's best not to see an opponent that you 're going to fight . After watching a film I may lose respect for a guy and get in there and get surprised . I just have in my mind about Johansson that he knocked out Eddie Machen , so he must be great , and I create a certain amount of respect for him . When I get up in the ring with him , ex  --  pecting he can do everything , I 'm pre  --  pared for everything . " 59 " Let 's take a couple of the title fights you 've had , " I said . " You were on the canvas with both Rademacher and Harris . Did this disturb you , to find yourself down ? Did you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " " In the Rademacher fight I did . The reporters came back to the dressing room , and some did n't think it was a knockdown . If I wanted to get out of it , I had my chance right there . It was a knockdown , though . Now , Harris was rated Number Four , and I 'd much rather say that Harris knocked me down , rather than Rademacher , but I did n't think it was a knockdown . " " Were you satisfied with your perform  --  ances in those fights ? " " No . I thought I could have been bet  --  ter in both of them . " " Have you ever been angered by what somebody has written about you ? " I asked . " No . They can say whatever they want about me , about what they think I am-1 ca n't fight and all that . Whether I can do it or not , I 'm going to try anyway . The only thing that makes me angry is sometimes when I pick up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to read about my manager . Like they may say he 's no good , or he 's this and that . It makes me feel like they 're talking directly to me , and I 've ate and slept with the man . I know him better than they do , and they 're trying to tell me about him . " " In other words , you 're hurt more by criticism of Cus than you are by any  --  thing they may say about you ? " " Yes . I know how reporters are . They have to write something sometimes . If they wrote good all the time it would be  --  come uninteresting to the public , so they got to write bad . See ? " " That 's a kind of a philosophical ap  --  proach , at least , " I said . " The fact that you feel badly when Cus is criticized re  --  minds me that you once told me how sorry you felt for Archie Moore after you knocked him out . Did you feel that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " With all my championship fights I generally feel that way afterwards , be  --  cause I know how it feels for them . When I lost a light to Joey Maxim I got a taste of how it feels to lose a fight , and I do n't want to go through that again . " Patterson 's only loss in thirty-five pro  --  fessional fights was to Maxim at the Eastern Parkway Arena in Brooklyn , on June 7 , 1954 . Although the three officials were unanimous in their decision , eleven of the twelve ringside reporters thought Patterson had won . " What was it like to lose ? " I asked . " Were you able to sleep that night ? " " 1 was n't able to sleep . I lay awake thinking about it . It was very hard to go out and face people , especially people who felt that I was going to beat him . I kind of stayed in for a while . " " Do you get to sleep right after a fight when you win ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the time I go to bed until 1 wake up the next morning , I think I still know I won . I 'm sort of semiconscious of it . When I wake up I know that I 've already won the fight . " " Do you lie there for a while then and see the fight , play it hack in your mind ? " " Quite a bit . Like the last fight , the Harris tight . Although I won , I was very much disappointed about it , because there were so many opportunities that I had and did n't take advantage of . I do n't think I ever fought a fight where 1 had that many opportunities and did n't take advantage of them . " " This reminds me , " I said , " of some  --  thing that Mr. Ernst Papanek once told me about you . " ? 11 38T Phis:Inch , the esecutise director of the disssek School for Boys , where Panel - son spent a ' WM- Alit it half , once de scribed Pau to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but sofa " Papanek said he beho cd that Patterson does not want to hurt his opponents , and now I repeated this to Patterson. " a ou missed opportunities in the Har  --  ris l said , - because you backed off when YOU had Ilins hurt . Were you con  --  scious of pits and of backing off ? " " No . The only thing -- the only sign of pity 1 was conscious of  --  was when he got that cut over the eye . When I 'm lighting , sometimes I go all through the tight without looking m the oppo  --  nent 's face . I generally look right at the chest . But there was once there . I do n't remember what round it was , that 1 looked up into the eye and you could see the flesh , It looked like one piece was down and the other piece was sort of hanging on . and you could see nothing but flesh , and the blood was kind of ooz  --  ing out . So I tried to lower my punches . In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them That 's the only time I can recall . " " Then you really had a feeling of sympathy for him ? " " ! t was n't necessary for me to try to ruin the fighter . I was way ahead on points . " " Do you think it 's true , then , when they say you lack the killer instinct ? " " I do n't think that 's what the killer in  --  stinct is . " " What do you think it is ? " " To me , the killer instinct is to win a fight . Just get up there and , if you get a chance to knock him out , knock him out . Or beat him by a decision . Do n't try to ruin him or kill him . If that 's the killer instinct , then I definitely do n't have it . " " Are you repelled by the sight of blood ? " " Can you remember , as a child , ever being really scared because your own blood was flowing ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was younger . One time I fell down the steps , and it seemed like my nose would n't stop bleeding . All I was worried about was that I did n't want my mother to know , and I tried to hide it . " " What this may come down to , then , " I said . " is that you may be less disturbed by an injury to yourself than by an injury to someone else . " " On somebody else , yes . It used to be  --  this has n't happened lately  --  in the winter  --  time . when it 's cold and my nose feels cold and my ears are cold , and I see two people fighting on the street , if I see a guy with a big fist hit the other guy square in the nose or the face , 1 feel it myself . I would rather be fighting the guy or tak  --  ing the punishment than to see the other guy taking it , because I can just imagine how it feels to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the feeling you have toward others . " 1 said , " do you ever wonder what some of the other fighters , whom you had to beat on the way up , are doing now ? " " Yes , " he said . " Hurricane Jackson  --  it was sad news to hear about him . He 's looking for a job now , and it seems he ca n't even find a job . It 's only the two fights that he had with me that he really had a chance to make some money . and I just hope that something good happens for him . " " Are there any others ? " " Me and Jimmy Slade , " he said , " We used to be very good friends . We used to be up at camp a lot , and we 'd be playing cards or playing games , and he used to get mad and say , ' I 'll punch you in the mouth . ' I 'd laugh because he 'd only beioking , but if imybody else was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I acted toward each other , they 'd think he wits the superior . I let him think that way , too , because I never dreamed that I was going to fight him up until I Patterson won nil eight-round decision front Stade in New York on November 19 , 1954 . Thirteen months later he stopped Slade in seven rounds in Los Angeles . " When I fought him the first time , " Patterson said now , " I do n't think he was in shape . But the way 1 beat him kind of changed things . 1 called hint the next morning , and he was n't there . I spoke to his mother , and his mother seemed pretty heartbroken about it . l told her that Jimmy was n't in shape , which he prob  --  ably was n't . In fact , I told everybody that . So . I did n't get a chance to see him too much afterwards , and when I did see him , it seemed like he could n't look me in the face , or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he was in shape then  --  and after that I never saw him any more . " " It 's kind of sad , " I said . " You unwit  --  tingly destroy a pleasant relationship . " " That 's right , " Patterson said . " I really liked him . I liked him very much . " " Your mother once told me , Floyd , that when you were small , you had a very bad temper . Do you remember that ? " " 1 did n't lose my temper too much . 1 would lose it , though . One time I was on my way to school , and this boy ran up to me , and he had about four big bottles of soda . He was running , so he said , ' Here . Here 's two bottles for you : I knew the boy . so I took the two bottles , and I said to myself , I 'll take these down to school . Maybe the teacher will let me hold them in class till after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can get into the school , though , the cop  --  a detective  --  put his arms on my shoulders . He said , ' Where arc you going with that ? ' I said , ' A boy just gave them to me . ' He said , ' You just robbed a factory , down the street . We saw you . ' " He took me back to the factory , and at the factory they said . ' You were just here , was n't you ? ' t said , ' No . I was n't . ' I tried to explain , and the cop got a little nasty and took one of the crates  --  you know , an empty crate  --  and bashed it over my head . And then I just hauled off . " " What did you do ? " " I do n't remember . Throwing crates at him , jumping up and throwing , smash  --  ing up . Everything happened then , and finally they got me and took me home . " He paused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You see : ' he said , " if I had been guilty I would never have lost my temper like that  --  if l had really done this thing . Id id n ' t . " " In the last couple of years or so , " said , " has anything made you lose your temper ? " " No , " he said , shaking his head . When Patterson was a child , Joe Louis was his hero . I asked now , " Do you re  --  member how you felt when you first met him , Floyd ? " " When I first met Joe Louis  --  it was at a dinner  --  my mind went back and I thought , If he only knew haw much I used to nbuire him . I still admire hint , but when I was a kid I used to actually have a scrapbook of him . And I used to brag about him and , if it was necessary , fight about him . Other kids had other ideas  --  you know , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me it was Louis all the way . And when I saw him for the first time , I just could n't believe it . ' ' " Has it ever occurred to you , " I said , " that today there may be kids who have the same attitude about you , and who would get the same thrill from meeting you ? " " No , " he said , shaking his head . " I do n't think so . Joe Louis  --  what he did to me ; well , the way I feel about it , what he did in the fights and the people that he beat , like Schmeling , and what not  --  I do n't think anybody else can ever reach his level , " " Tell me about the visit you had from Joe a few weeks ago , " I said , " You want me to tell that ? " he said , and he seemed surprised that I knew about it . " Wel I , Joe came to see me about having a fight for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table  --  and I was sit  --  ting here " ? he motioned toward a couple of rubbing tables near the windows that look out over 14th Street ? " and he said , ' If you have a fight for the I.B.C. , it would sort of be like doing me a favor . You know , just one fight . ' So 1 told him to go and see Cus . I sent him up to Cus ' office . " " The way you idolized Joe , " I said , " this must have been very hard for you to do . " " It was definitely hard . I could have refused point-blank , but I admired him so much that I told him to see Cus . Had it been Truman Gibson or Jim Norris or somebody like that , I would have point  --  blank walked away and said definitely not at all . Seeing it was Joe Louis , I had him go see Cus , because I could n't tell him. - " Tell me in your own words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the International Boxing Club to be about . " " Well , " he said , and he took a deep breath , " all I can say is , the I.B.C. , they have had their own fighters . They not only have had the fighters , but they have had the managers and practically all the match  --  makers also . In order for a fighter to get ahead or to even get a championship fight , they had to be a part of the I.B.C. See ? " That 's what I was told , and as far as what Cus was doing against them . I was one hundred per cent behind him . If there was n't any such thing as the 1 . B.C. , I think I would have been fighting maybe four or five times a year , because there would have been more fighters coming along , " " But you 've been caught in the middle , " I said . " In this campaign that Cus carried on , you were the middleman and your career suffered . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet you were willing to be the sufferer ? " " Well , I was willing to be the guinea pig . Somebody had to do it . Eventually , if the fight game went on like it 's been going on in the past , I think it would come to a standstill , and there would n't be anything for no fighter . Somebody would have to sacrifice . " " What are some of the other problems of being heavyweight champion of the world ? Are there problems associated with the title that you never thought of before you became champion ? " " Well , one of the main problems  --  I thotieht that , when I h. came champion , from then on everything would be easy , You know ? I thought , Now I can relax , because I have what I wait ! . Actually , was relaxing more before I had the cham  --  pionship , because now that I have it , I got to fight to keep it . Now I 'm the cham  --  pion , and everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 'll fight ? " " I 'll light up until I 'm permanently de  --  feated  --  until I 'm knocked into retirement or I should become disinterested in it . " " How long might it be before you be  --  come disinterested ? " " I do n't know . I think it 'll be a pretty long time , because I 'm getting more and more interested in it as the days go by . 1 mean , I 'm not getting bored with it at all . I might get knocked into retirement when I 'm twenty-five , or older , or I might not get knocked into it until I 'm forty , Who knows ? I might become disinter  --  ested . Whichever comes first . " " What will you do when you stop fighting ? " " I 'm going to live on a farm somewhere ' way upstate a couple of hundred miles , I 'd like to raise horses , have a family , I want to get a farm  --  something I can take care of by myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have one other question , " I said . " As a celebrity , Floyd , you have a cer  --  tain burden that the white man who is a celebrity does n't have , Do you feel that you have a responsibility to Negroes to be exemplary in your conduct ? " " I 'm conscious of it , " he said , nodding . " I do know that anything I do that 's bad will reflect on my people . But 1 have no intention of doing anything bad anySway . " While we had been talking , Jim Cleary had been tape-recording the interview and Jacob Lofman had been photographing Patterson . I asked them if there were any questions they wanted to ask . " No , " Cleary said . " 1 have none . " " I 'd like to ask you a question , " Lof  --  man said to Patterson . " If you do n't want to answer , O.K. Does it make a difference to you when you fight whether it 's a white man or not ? When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited when you fight a white man ? " " No , " Patterson said , shaking his head and looking at Lofman . " No . " " Let 's put it this way , " Lofman said . " Do you feel your consciousness as a Negro more ? " " In other words , " I said , " do you feel that you represent your race when you 're fighting ? " " Well , " Patterson said , " the only thing  --  my last fight , with Roy Harris-1 heard some of the things that were said about the fight . I know the South was all backing him up and all that , and most of the colored people , you know , they did n't want to see me get beat , So it was more of a thing like that . When I got up in the ring , though , none of that even entered my mind . He was just another man , like everybody else has been , that I was out to get or he would get me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of the fight or how much was involved and everything else during the fight , " " You know , " Lofman said , " that Joe Louis , I guess , is pretty much broke . Do you think about that  --  not to be in his position when you retire ? " " I learn from other people 's exam  --  ples , " Patterson said . " I 'm definitely positive I wo n't be in Joe Louis 's post-lion , even if I was never to fight again , starting today . Of course , I would n't have all the money in the world . I would n't call myself wealthy , but I would be able to say l got something out of what I put into it . " " Thanks , Floyd , " Lofman said . " Thanks a lot . "
