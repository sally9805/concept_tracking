 | " Well , they picked my uncle for the first show , " he said weakly . " You know , Uncle Doc , the guy I told you about . " " Oh . That 's how you got the job as consultant . " " Like hell . This agency vice-president got the whole idea for the show on an article I did . He admitted it . " Sandra weighed the young man 's improbable story . She had always regarded Myron as an engaging clown ; now , there was a good chance he was developing into a worthwhile personality , someone almost as interesting as the off-Broadway director she had a date with the following night . " Well , gee , that 's wonderful , Myron . You 're on your way . " " In more ways than one , doll . " He tried to get an inept hand on one inviolate breast , but she was fast and strong , and her father 's only daughter . Her charms , like the fine bathroom fixtures Mr. Dorgenicht manufactured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunters like Myron . " How ' bout a date next Saturday ? " he asked hesitantly . " I 'd love to , Myron , but I 'm going to Cornell for the weekend . " " Ya just graduated . Whatcha goin ' back for ? " " I still have friends there . " " That guy in law school . " " Oh , not just him . A whole gang of kids . " Gloom oozed upward around Myron 's slumping form like quicksand . He had a bloodhound 's nose for success and failure , and now , after his brief and triumphal announcement , he was back in the bog . In the long run , Sandra and her family and her friends at Cornell had it , and he did n't . He thought of his Uncle Doc and the crumbling yellow brick house , the creaking Buick , the waiting room that was so rarely filled . Whatever it was that had defeated his uncle would not reach him . He would learn from Thrasher . " C'm on , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need a coupla quick bourbons . Let 's go to the Wet End . " " The what ? " " The Wet End . I guess your friends , in TEP and ZBT were too fancy for that kind of place . The West End Bar . Only I call it the Wet End . " She assembled her splendid virginal body and walked primly ahead of him , denying him even a moist palm . The air-conditioning had broken down at Whitechapel during the night , and the ensuing discomfort lent a happy feeling of " roughing it " to the stratified office . There were jokes about the girls stripping down , speculation as to what kind of underwear  | old T.C. wore , rumors that Ben Loomer , a notorious tightwad , was opening a lemonade concession , and finally a pool , initiated in the art department , on what time the cooling system would resume operation . Thrasher found the leveling banter tiresome , but he joined in with insincere vigor . He was unquestionably the most popular executive in the organization , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hot enough for you , Mr. Thrasher ? " the receptionist asked . " Is what hot enough , Porter ? " The receptionist 's first name was Porter ; she was big-busted and deeply tanned and her triangular glasses had Scotch-plaid frames . " Oh , you know what I mean . There 's no air-conditioning today ! " Thrasher clutched at his throat . " Thank God ! And I thought I had undulant fever ! " She giggled appreciatively , waving Variety at him as he went by and crying nasally , " You made Variety , have you seen ? " Louise had efficiently opened the windows in his office ; she had located an immense floor fan , and it was whirring madly . She opened Variety to the Radio-TV section and was marking an item with red pencil . " Gee , Louise , Porter Simpson pulled a funny one on me . She asked me if it was hot enough for me . Pretty good line , eh ? How come you never say clever things like that ? " " She learns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All I can afford is Jones Beach . She 'll probably get the new job in media because she says such snazzy things , and wears plaid glasses . " He peeled off his jacket and tie in one swift gesture ; he rather enjoyed the heat for a change . It justified slovenliness and sweating , two conditions of life which the office generally frowned upon . He sipped at his morning coffee , and read the Variety article which Louise had marked for his attention . The one-column headline read : G &; T Dumps Higgins ; Telementary Next ? Client and Agency unhappiness over low rating means an exit for the Brick Higgins Wednesday night opus . Last week 's test run convinced Whitechapel biggies that the comic 's half hour wo n't suit their purposes . Gatling &; Theis , whose heavy coin is Whitechapel 's biggest source of income , is said to have agreed to a brand-new telementarytype actuality program for the fall . While this kind of eggheadry is usually the network 's bailiwick , Whitechapel executives feel their property is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Loomer , agency veep , the new format combines elements of Person to Person , See It Now , This Is Your Life , and We the People . Loomer and Tom Finucane , account exec for G &; T , are riding herd on the project , tentatively titled Americans , USA . Woodrow Thrasher of the Agency is slated to write the new series , and Andrew Bain Lord is said to have the inside track for the emceeing job . " It 's very interesting , is n't it ? " Louise asked . " You get equal billing with Lord  --  and he is n't even hired yet . " Thrasher patted his neck gently with his handkerchief . It served him right . He had been too damn secretive about everything , and he had underestimated , Loomer 's jealousy . At least three dozen people , in and out of the agency , knew that Woody Thrasher had created Americans , U.S.A. and was producing it ; to subvert history , to create a clear fiction which could readily be challenged was the rash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story from the page when Loomer walked in . Loomer greeted him with a bland smile . " Hiya , Woody . How 's the doctor 's best friend ? " Thrasher tossed the Variety clipping onto his desk . " This is a nice piece of publicity , " Thrasher said evenly . " Must be a lot of trade interest in our project already . " Loomer winked . " Tom and I felt we had to give the project a little push . You know  --  working on such a tight schedule , and you running off to Brooklyn every day . Man , you 're a bear for work . Ca n't do the whole thing yourself , Woody . " " Yes , I notice from your quotes that I 'm not doing it all myself . It 's a funny thing , Ben , I remember that first meeting we had after the Higgins fiasco , and I ca n't remember you suggesting ? " Loomer leaned forward . " That 's not what the story says , Woody . " Suddenly , in Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hardness that had eluded him heretofore . " It says you and Tom are riding herd , ' Ben . What 's a herdrider ? You must be an executive herd-rider , at least . What does that make me ? " " Let 's not be bitter , Woody , " Loomer said . He was no longer smiling . " No one 's trying to crab your act . But , frankly , neither old man Gatling nor T.C. like the way you 're keeping them in the dark . Hiring Dexter Daw without telling anyone  --  a guy with his rotten reputation . Tom and I mean to keep an eye on the project . We have every right to . Dammit , Woody , I should n't have to explain all this . " The door opened and Finucane 's flat Boston vowels assaulted them .  | " I just spoke to Andy Lord , Ben , " Finucane exploded . Thrasher grimaced , ignoring Finucane and keeping his eyes fastened on Loomer . " What 's this about Andrew Bain Lord working the show ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , Woody ? G dr T has been sponsoring Andy Lord on radio for twelve years . Tom and I talked to them as soon as T.C. got the go-ahead , and , naturally , Lord 's name came up . He 's a natural for the job . " " Surprise , surprise , " said Thrasher . " What if I do n't want any talent on the show ? What if I decide we 'll go with real people for a change ? What does that do to Andrew Bain Lord ? " " Oh , for Christ 's sake , Woody , " Finucane said wearily . " You 're always so damned negative . We 're only talkin ' about Andy Lord . Maybe he wo n't emcee . Maybe he 'll do commercials , maybe just intro the show . " " Maybe we wo n't do live commercials . Maybe just one filmed institutional . Maybe just a brief sponsor identification . " Thrasher was looking desperately for some feint to set them off balance , something to regain his edge . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both T.C. and the client and had secured for themselves  --  even if it were purely a fictional designation ? control of the program . But a well-publicized fiction , Thrasher understood grimly , was better than an obscured fact . Loomer pursed his lips before answering . " I 'm goin ' to give it to you straight ? " " You and Sergeant Friday , " Thrasher muttered . " ? and you know , Woody , Tom and I think damn highly of you . " " You bet we do ! " Finucane clapped a fat arm around Thrasher 's shoulders . " But you 're a tough guy to reason with ! " Thrasher recoiled . Clearly , they were not prepared to edge him out entirely . They merely wanted to be included ; sufficiently involved to claim credit for a success , yet sufficiently detached so that no onus would fall upon them in the event of a disaster . " Let me say this , " Loomer drawled . " You 're the creative guy in this outfit . We know it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations  --  network contacts  --  and , well  --  over-all supervision has to be our responsiblity . Just as it is on any package this agency turns out . We 're a team , Woody , not a bunch of grandstanders . " " Okay , Ben , " Thrasher said quietly . " I 'm a big boy . " " Something else bothers me , " Loomer said , ignoring his proffered olive branch . " I think you 're tackling too much . We 're supposed to hit the air in ten days and you do n't have a darn thing to show is in the way of a format , a script , not even a coherent idea . "  | " There 's plenty of time , " Thrasher said . " I work best under pressure . " " But you forget you 're not the whole show . A lot of money and a lot of jobs are riding on this pilot program . If Gatling buys , we 've got to be prepared to offer thirteen more solid shows . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and sixty million shows . " " I have asked Ted Chilson to head up an advance unit for future shows . Ted will report to me . I 'm authorizing a research staff for him . And after we cull out some fifty future subjects , I 'm going to set up a rotational system for scripting . You 'll get to do maybe one out of every four . Or , if you want , you can give up the writing altogether . Frankly , I 'd be happier if you did . There 's simply too much to do , and the only way we can succeed is if we leapfrog the work . " Thrasher studied the ruddy , round-faced man with frank admiration . He himself had never been good at that sort of thing , he was too prone to short cuts and labor-saving techniques . " You 're really organizing , are n't you , Ben ? " Loomer nodded slowly . " The only way to operate , Woody . I 'd like you to sit in on an advance meeting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects . " " I ca n't , " Thrasher said . " I have to visit the doctor again . " Jesus Christ ! " Finucane shouted . " You takin ' the nine-day cure or somethin ' ? " " Hold the meeting without me , Ben . You and Tom can block out the next show on the basis of Ted Chilson 's research , I 'm sure . " " I 'd like you to be at the meeting , " Loomer persisted . He had lost , for the moment , his Midwestern rhythms , and was speaking in pure New Yorkese . A dental " t " had crept into his carefully guarded speech patterns . " What happened to your drawl , Ben ? " Thrasher asked . " You 'd better find it for that meeting this afternoon . No one 'll recognize you with that Flatbush brogue . You can fill me in tomorrow on what happens . " Leaving , he punched Finucane playfully in his glutton 's paunch . " Hot enough for you , Father Feeney ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he walked out . For the time being all three of them realized it was a stand-off . They would need Thrasher to create and mold the new show ; but he would need them simply because they were powerful and secure in a world which he had never fully joined . He would defy them and taunt them at the moment . But they would forget neither the  | defiance nor the taunts ; and if somehow his value were to be diminished , they would be waiting for him . Apparently they knew something he did n't , something relevant to the client 's attitude which they were shrewdly keeping from him . Leaving Loomer 's office , he saw old T.C. , prim , cool , and maddeningly neat in a black suit and a stiff detachable collar , and he wondered if he might carry an appeal to him . But it was too early for this . T.C. Whitechapel liked to believe that everything hummed along smoothly and happily . His mind was like a peeled hard-boiled egg , smooth and slick and untroubled by dents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T.C. greeted him . There was not a sign of sweat on his soft pink face . Thrasher imagined he was desiccated inside  --  no liquids were left to seep through . " Good morning , T.C. Is it true that some spy from BBD &; 0 sabotaged the air-conditioning ? " The old man smiled feebly , and Thrasher wondered whether he understood the joke . " Is it hot enough for you , Woodrow ? " he asked pleasantly . " I should think so , sir . Two copywriters are prostrated from heat exhaustion , and a girl in media has gone stark raving mad . But if we can hold off Muhullah Khan another day the relief column from Lucknow , commanded by Victor McLaglen , should be able to save us . It was the kind of nonsensical sally that was expected of him , but the old man just blinked his eyes a few times , turned abruptly , and walked into his office . Dexter Daw joined Thrasher later in the morning , and they remained in conference through the day , Louise ordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed the afternoon 's work . They discussed placement of cameras ; a basic routine ; the emphasis that the half-hour program would take . The subject of Andrew Bain Lord came up , and Thrasher was pleased to learn that the director shared his unflattering view of Loomer 's choice of talent . " We will need a pro to cross the is and dot the i 's , " Daw said . " But Andrew Bain Lord  --  he 's goofed every television job he 's had . He 's great for that midmorning philosophy for housewives . But this deal needs somebody with a name . Stature . For example , Eisenhower . He 'd be perfect . " Thrasher looked at Daw 's inverted pear of a head with quiet admiration . He had a lot in common with the young director . Only someone with a genuine feel for the business , with a certain screwball daring , would dare to suggest that the President of the United i11  | States introduce commercials for deodorants . But it was the kind of " big thinking " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Eisenhower , " said Thrasher reflectively . He sipped his iced tea , and glanced sideways at Daw . " Yes , he 'd be great , Dec . " " Or someone like Oppenheimer , if he had n't goofed . Someone completely unexpected to introduce our typical worthwhile American every week . Not a performer , but someone with a name , a meaning to the public . A Helen Hayes , or a John Gunther . Maybe Roy Campanella . " Leaning forward to catch the fan 's warm breeze , Thrasher found himself grinning . " Dec , it 's just occurred to me that we 're playing the great TV game Who Can We Get ? ' But has anyone ever played it on such a cosmic level ? You 've covered politics , science , the arts , sports , and you 've even got the Commie issue . You 're liable to convince me you 're serious , and I 'll replace you with Gadge Kazan . Hey  --  he 's another name that always comes up in Who Can We Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We get Steve Allen to play the part ! " Thrasher finished . Daw drained his container of tea , making a sucking sound as the straw drew up the dregs . " You know , you 're not a bad asshole for an agency fink , Thrasher . Do you ever talk like that at board meet-ings ? " " Too much , Dec , too much . You read Variety ? " " I saw it . " " I 've got a couple of herd-riders over me . " " Is a herd-rider higher or lower than a project officer ? We got project officers at our shop . " " Dexter , you and I should start a crusading newspaper in a small town in Vermont . Let 's chuck the whole business , like in those novels where the highly paid whore goes off to be an honest Life Magazine reporter . Daw was cracking ice cubes with $is rodent 's teeth . " I 'd hate it . I love this disgusting business we 're in . How else could I eat and drink so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From outside , Louise buzzed him and he picked up his outside line . It was his wife , sounding fresh , cheerful , and alert ; a negation of the sour game he and Daw had been playing , and affirmation that they lived in a good , productive world . " Can you make the early train , Woody ? " Ann asked . " It must be unbearable in town . "  | " I ca n't , sweetie . I have to go to Long Beach tonight . " " Long Beach ! What ever for ? " " Dr. Abelman goes out there every Thursday night . " " Oh , rats . Junior wo n't know his daddy pretty soon . Ca n't you come home after you 're through with him ? Where is Long Beach anyway ? " " South Shore . It 'll be much easier for me to stay in New York . That 's the trouble with this city . It 's as far from one suburb to another as it is from New York to Boston . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend the evening assembling the new redwood set . The braces for the legs still do n't fit , but I 'll saw them down to size . " " Why do n't they fit ? We 've exchanged them three times already . We paid cash money for the table . Why should n't the braces be properly made ? Is n't anybody responsible for a goof like that ? " " It 's a six-foot table , dear , and all they had left were braces for a seven-foot table . Remember , it was a sale . " They both paused briefly ; the minor domestic crisis had provided them with a subject for mutual concern . Now they had nothing left to talk about . " Woody , " she said querulously , " you 're sure you 're not in the poker game again ? " " Poker ? Hell no . Baby , I 'm working hard at this project . I 've got a deadline and an internal problem right here to worry about . Whatever gave you that idea ? " " Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy trip to Long Beach . " " Have a good evening with the redwood table , dear . " Daw had flattened out the straws from his iced tea container and was snapping them together . " The suspicious wife , hey , Thrasher ? Why do n't you be like me ? Do n't try to cover up . Tell her everything . Clinical details . I drove my wife nuts with it , and she leaves me alone now . " " Shut up for a minute , will you , Daw ? " Thrasher said . " And stop snapping those goddam straws . " From the outer office they heard the hysterical shrieking of several of the girls , the kind of abandoned noise which usually followed the announcement of an engagement or a pregnancy . Thrasher buzzed Louise . " Now what is that all about ? " For the moment , he felt like Dr. Abelman , cursing the galoots beneath his waiting room window . " The air-conditioning just went on , " she said .  | " What 's so hysterical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had three-thirty , and it 's three-twenty-eight . You almost won , you had three-twenty . " " Second best , eh ? Loomer must have a drag with building maintenance . They wo n't even let me win an office pool . " Even as he spoke , he realized that his words were born less from his role of office cynic than from a genuine fear of Loomer . The big man with the false drawl was not quite as dependable or friendly as he had thought . It was strange , he thought , how everything starts unraveling at once . He did n't like the tone of his wife 's voice ; he had no clear idea where his wild venture into programming was taking him ; and the crisis in the agency was more serious than he had imagined . He looked at Daw , at twenty-seven , a drifter on the fringe of the industry  --  a professional lunch-eater and meeting-goer . Thrasher was pressing forty ; he could not afford to be a middle-aged Dexter Daw . He took a rattling Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the address the doctor had given him . It was just turning dark as he walked up the brick path to the small boardinghouse where Mrs. Abelman was spending the summer . The house was a malformed stucco and timber relic of the twenties . A large family of wealthy junk dealers had built it , a mass of small rooms and oversized baths . A Negro handyman was wrestling the day 's garbage to the curb . Under the awning over the open porch , a convocation of whitehaired ladies sat nodding and chatting in muted voices . Thrasher asked a fragile woman with the pointed face of an aged vaudevillian where he could find Dr. Abelman . She smiled coyly and told him the doctor was inside watching television . He walked through a creaking screen door into a small dining room which led to a glassed-in porch . A handful of elderly people , the doctor among them , and some drowsy children were gathered about a television set . Spying his visitor , the doctor rose , gesturing to a short , gray woman sitting next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're right on time , " the doctor said . It was the kind of place where the most minute departure from routine was marked with extensive ceremony . No one was watching the screen ; all eyes had turned to Thrasher . A few white heads were peeking through the screen door to study the caller . " It 's hot as hell here , " Dr. Abelman said . " How about a walk on the boardwalk ? " " Oh , do n't let me take you from the show you were watching . "  | " I 've seen enough . All I really like is the commercial . " Thrasher looked puzzled . " You 're joking . " " I mean it . The one where the fellow goes into the tobacco store and buys the pack of tobacco . He pays the clerk the money and walks out . Just the way you or I would do it . " " I never thought of it that way , " said Thrasher , making a mental note that the doctor 's estimate of commercials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is my wife , Mr. Thrasher , " the doctor said , smiling . " Sarah , this is the young man who wants me to be Boris Thomashefsky . " " I 'm delighted to meet you , Mrs. Abelman . " A stout , gray-haired woman , with prim , bland features , she returned the greeting , smiling through rimless glasses , and immediately asking , with deep concern , whether he had eaten . " I ate in New York before leaving , thank you , " Thrasher said . " I hope I 'm not interfering with your evening . I could see ? " " Interfering ? " the doctor asked . " Who ever does anything here ? C'm on , the boardwalk is nice at night . " The doctor 's wife cautioned him against tripping on the darkened steps ( he guided her gently by the arm ) , wondered whether he needed a sweater , and began to fret over Thrasher 's train schedule . " Where do you live , Mr. Thrasher ? " " Stamford , Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to travel ! How in the world will you get home tonight ? " He assured her he would manage . She was , he could see , a gentle and submissive person , one who went through life worrying about trivia and constantly cautioning those she liked to be alert against minor catastrophes . Trains would be missed , unbrellas forgotten , doors left unlocked , milk bills unpaid , friends offended , unless she were on guard to remind her family about these small impending disasters . If , while urging a beloved grandchild to finish his oatmeal , a bomb were to fall on her house , she would rise , unshaken , from the rubble and remind him that oatmeal was full of vitamins . It was warm and misty on the boardwalk . They sat on a green bench beneath a lamppost , watching the ocean 's rhythmic assault against the darkened beach . Stout elderly couples drifted by in postprandial smugness ; glowing cigar tips illumined the foggy night ; teen-age boys on rented bicycles sprinted amidst the stately walkers with the pointless defiance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program , Mr. Thrasher , and I 'm quite thrilled , " the doctor 's wife said . She spoke in a low  | voice , with no trace of accent . " And I want you to know he 's delighted also , even though he probably is telling you that it 's a bother . " " I 'm sure we 'll have a great show , " Thrasher said . " And it was very kind of you to give my nephew a job , too . Myron is a very talented boy . He just needs a break , the poor kid . He writes very well . " " I 'm sure he does , " Thrasher said , recalling with faint revulsion his promise to the ugly young man whose soupy prose had first brought him to the doctor 's home . Thrasher took out his notebook and pen , and the doctor almost on cue , asked him where he wanted his story to begin . " I 'd suggest , Dr. Abelman , you get into the early influences in your life that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor rose , resting against the boardwalk railing , and facing the agency man . " What do you think , Sarah ? Should I leave out all about how we were kids on the Lower East Side ? " " It was pretty routine , " she said . " Dr. Abelman 's family was very , very poor . My own folks were a little better off . My father had a wholesale grocery business . " She sounded quite proud . " He was something of a windbag , too . " It was a little game they had , Thrasher realized . They had made the same jokes for many , many years , and if malice had ever been part of them , it had been worn away long ago by constant repetition . " I ran errands for my old man for years , " the doctor said . " His specialty was waiters ' jackets . I used to do his delivery work . You ever try to lug a stack of boxes filled with alpaca jackets on and off a trolley car ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what a bunch of tight bastards they were . The only ones meaner were the trolley car conducters . But what should I expect from an Irishman ? " He smiled , shaking his large head in amused reminiscence . " I kicked one conductor so hard in the shins one day I almost broke my foot . IIe tickled my father 's chin whiskers . What right did he have to do that to an old Jew who was n't bothering him ? " " Oh , Sam , " she said wearily . " He tells it a million times , and I 'm sick of hearing about it . He was always like that , Mr. Thrasher . Everybody 's problem was his . His whole family were nothing but weaklings  --  the kind of people who give in to everything . So Sam had to defend them . If he was n't fighting his brothers ' battles , he was defending his parents . Once somebody called his brother Moishe a dirty name at the shirt factory where he worked . Do n't  | you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go down and pick a fight for that big ox of a brother who would n't raise his hands to help himself ? " The doctor grinned . " Boy , did those Italians give me my lumps ! " A Brueghel panorama depicting the squalid jungle of New York 's Lower East Side at the turn of the century began forming in Thrasher 's mind . In a series of detailed vignettes , he saw the small , muscular form of the young Sam Abelman taking on his enemies ? a streetcar conducter here , a policeman there . " That 's one of the reasons I became a gym teacher , " said the doctor . " I liked the idea of being strong . Everywhere I looked people were shoving us around . Not just Jews , mind you , but anyone who would n't stick up for himself . If you were a greenhorn , you got shoved . " " A gym teacher ? " Thrasher asked . " Oh , did n't the doctor tell you ? " Mrs. Abelman asked . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meets them . " As if to amend for this oversight , the doctor rolled up his shirt sleeve , and shoved a mammoth , undulating biceps in Thrasher 's face . " Feel that , young fellah . I can still handle myself . " Thrasher , with slight repugnance , touched the lumpy white flesh . It was like a granite slab ; hard , unyielding , and as wide as Thrasher 's thigh . " That did n't come from reading poetry , " the doctor said proudly , " although , as a matter of fact , we did a lot of that also , when we were kids . " " You 're in excellent condition , doctor , " Thrasher said admiringly . " That 's what Hector O'Bannion liked about me , " the doctor said . His intonation indicated that he not only expected Thrasher to know who Hector O'Bannion was , but to be thoroughly awed by the doctor 's association with him . Mrs. Abelman , perceiving the visitor 's blank expression , intervened . " Hector O'Bannion was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a physical culture nut . " " Says you , " the doctor interrupted curtly . " He was a damn fine man , and he ran a damn fine school . He was n't ashamed to be eccentric . " " He was still a physical culture nut , " Mrs. Abelman said in- I sistently . " If you want to talk about someone , why do n't you talk about Mr. Comerford ? He was a much better influence on you . " On the oak paneling behind Mr. Comerford 's desk were mounted  | the memorabilia of what had clearly been the great experience of his life . There was a framed , fading picture of General Thomas F. Meagher , commanding officer of the Irish Brigade , in tailored battle coat , the silver stars thickly embroidered on black shoulder knots . He wore a sprig of evergreen in his broad-brimmed hat . There was a picture of three rumpled privates of the Union Army , thin young men of the 88th New York , resting , with the false arrogance of enlisted men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit less flamboyantly than the others , and trying to look grim behind a fledgling mustache , was Mr. Comerford himself , then Private William Comerford , Company B , 88th New York . There was also a map of Fredericksburg , showing the deadly stone wall from behind which Confederate sharpshooters massacred the attackers . Beneath the map , mounted on cotton batting , was the misshapen lead bullet with which a Rebel infantryman had struck Private Comerford in the right knee , removing him from combat forever at bloody Fredericksburg . He was among the lucky : of fourteen hundred members of the Irish Brigade whom bumbling Ambrose Burnside had sent against the Confederate lines , only two hundred and fifty survived . Every morning , Mondays through Saturdays , Sammy Abelman opened the street-level door of Comerford &; Sons , Twine and Paper Bags , and , in the center of the office , he would pause briefly at his employer 's battle shrine . There was a quiet awareness of the past in Mr. Comerford 's display that intrigued him . On winter mornings , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm his hands at the fire , listening to the kindling crack and spit , and imagining himself a part of Mr. Comerford 's valiant company . He was somewhat jealous of Mr. Comerford : nobody in his family could summon up such a past  --  meaningful , romantic , a segment of history , even though it symbolized a great defeat . ' What would his father have to show ? An old scissors and a needle ? He never was able to muse very long . After starting the fire , his next job was to sweep and dust . , He could expect Hanratty , the bookkeeper , any minute , and Hanratty could always be counted on to make some nasty remark . He was a small , cranky man with an oversized head , a common type of Irishman in the commercial world , but one rarely celebrated in the mythology of jolly policemen , inspired revolutionaries , and Celtic athletes . He had cultivated a series of expressions and gestures which he assumed to be symbols of authority : narrowed eyes , outthrust jaws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Sammy Abelman , feared Han-  | ratty , but it was much less trouble to pretend that the self-portrait was genuinely frightening . He never said good morning . His greeting was usually a brief critique of Sammy 's chores : " Ai n't much of a fire ! " " You dusted my desk yet ? " " Where 'd you put them new invoices ? " The proprietor of Comerford &; Sons would greet his two office employees with the same words he had used for more than thirty years , words , he claimed , he had heard General Meagher cry to his raw troops just before the Second Wave marched to death and mutilation across the plain of Fredericksburg . " Well , boys , are we ready for them ? " Mr. Comerford would ask . " Good morning , sir , " Sammy would say , barely looking up from his own midget desk . " Ready as ever , sir ! " Hanratty would chirp brightly . Mr. Comerford was in his middle sixties , yet aside from a small paunch , neatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean and limber as it had been in his infantry days . The sparse mustache had flowered into a thick gray mat , liberally stained with tobacco . Established behind his great mahogany desk , Mr. Comerford would sip a mug of Irish tea which Sammy had brewed for him on the glowing stove lid and would listen to Hanratty 's recital of woe . The bookkeeper was a born apostle of doom , and , although Mr. Comerford chose to close eyes and ears to the storm warnings , there was a good deal of truth in Hanratty 's dreary reports . " Sir , if we do n't move fast , we 'll lose that whole Altschuler order , " the bookkeeper would say . " Now what makes you say that , Andrew ? " Comerford would ask , in faintly shocked surprise . " Mr. Altschuler and I are very old friends . " " " Friends or no , " Hanratty would whine , " them smart salesmen from Acme have been chippin ' away at our order every month . Why do you think Altschuler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we used to send them fifty ? " " I 'm sure I do n't know , Andrew . Perhaps they are using less of it . " " Aw please , Mr. Comerford . Altschuler just opened two new stores . That 's a hot item . They 're buyin ' Acme 's is all . " Mr. Comerford spun about slowly in his great chair . It was all getting much too difficult for him . He had built the concern himself , starting with a door-to-door business , carrying his sample twines and bags in a huge carpetbag . He had done quite well ,  | sent two sons to law school , and lived to see them turn down the business for the more colorful pursuit of politics . Now he was watching the slow nibbling away of his customers by younger , more aggressive men . Over the years , his contacts had been established on two bases : personal friendship and a good product . He was discovering now that these were not enough . " Now , Andrew , listen to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter 's gnomish face twisted itself into sorrowful disagreement " what in the world difference does it make if I run down personally to see Mr. Altschuler and take him to lunch ? He knows me . He knows my merchandise . Why in the world must I go through the rigmarole of convincing him all over again ? " Beneath the Civil War display at the rear of his desk , Mr. Comerford kept a small bookcase , crammed not with business catalogues and ledgers but with a library of select works from which he could read during the slack late afternoon hours , much to Hanratty 's disgust . There was a Riverside edition of Thoreau , a similar set of Emerson , and the works of Whitman , Poe , and Hawthorne . In addition there were scattered volumes , faded and stained , of Plato , Homer , Virgil , and a ragged , crumbling set of Shakespeare . Sammy would bring his lunch from home and while Mr. Cornerford would leave the office for a bowl of soup and a glass of beer at the nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea in the dented copper kettle and munch giant sandwiches at their respective desks . The bookkeeper would read his newspaper , studying the financial pages with great avidity ; the young stenographer would borrow one of Mr. Comerford 's books and struggle through a few pages , in between bites of a farmer-cheeseand-tomato sandwich . " Whatcher readin ' that stuff for ? " Hanratty would ask . His eyes vanished , his pointed chin jutted forward belligerently . He had no particular contempt for the young man , it was merely Hanratty 's attitude toward anything that intruded on his notions of what people should be and what they should do . A caricature of an office Irishman himself , he resented departures from the norm in anyone else . " Trying to improve my mind , " Sammy answered . He had a mouthful of farmer cheese and trying to eat , defend himself against Hanratty 's thrusts , and absorb Walden was exceedingly difficult . " Aaah , " the bookkeeper sneered . " Whatcha wan na be ? A cawledge professor ? A poet ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my life . Or a bookkeeper. "  | Fresh kid . I bet you read that stuff because old Comerford reads it . I bet he do n't even understand it . What do you wan na be like him it for ? He 's on the way out , and he do n't even know it . You read his kind of books , you 'll end up like him . " " What 's wrong with Mr. Comerford ? " Hanratty smiled , a cracked humorless grimace . " He 's a sucker . He does n't know he 's outdated . Ca n't run a business like he does , depending on people he thinks are his friends . You got ta spread the word today , you got ta talk to customers , make ' em feel important . II Like Acme does . Like Loewenstein does . Oi vay , dot Lowenshteen he gats costumers ! " Sammy closed his book slowly . " What was that last crack supposed to be ? A dirty dig at me ? " " What crack ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the accent . I did n't like it . " " Do n't be so sensitive , Abelman . Who 's insultin ' you ? I meant it III for Lowenstein . Everyone in the business knows he 's a hustler , that he undercuts the price . " " Like hell you did . That accent was for my benefit . " Hanratty turned away . He did n't appreciate the way that young i , kike looked you over ; his eyes were too dark , and he did n't have that softness , that apologetic look that most of them had . At a quick glance , with those dark eyes , and the black shock of hair , the sharp , hooked nose , he could pass for an Indian as much as a Jew . In the afternoon , Mr. Comerford would dictate to Sammy , sign letters , check the sales and the incoming payments , and tour the small shipping and receiving office on the second floor . On this daily trip , Sammy would accompany him , clipboard at his side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German workmen . He liked the pungent , fresh smell of the new balls of twine , the efficiency with which the workmen packed and banded the crates , the i sense that Mr. Comerford , whom he admired and respected , had ? been responsible for creating all of it . One afternoon in March  --  it was one of those freakish days when the temperature and the atmosphere belong to winter , yet some unseen , unfelt warmth creeps through to deny the cold  --  Mr. Comerford did not return from lunch . Hanratty winked knowingly . " You 'll find out , Abelman . Your hero . All I can say is he 's been pretty good this year . Used to do it every other week . " It turned dark on lower Broadway . Gaslight glowed in the waterfront mist and cabs clattered uptown , taking the wealthy merchants home to their brownstones in Harlem and along Riverside Drive . The last workman checked out , looking curiously at Sammy as he  | sat patiently at his desk , waiting for his employer . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stenographer . " Why doncha beat it , kid ? The old man went on the town again . He wo n't be back . " Sammy looked at him innocently . " What do you mean ? " ' He 's drinkin ' up the profits . " They slammed the street door and vanished . Sammy looked at the wall clock . He would miss his evening classes at Normal College if he delayed any longer . Then he saw Mr. Comerford on the street . He was not wearing his topcoat ; his derby was cocked crazily to one side of his head , and he was smiling stupidly through his gold-rimmed spectacles . Leaning against the glass window , he was peeking through the gilt script which read Comerford &; Sons and rapping sharply to attract Sammy 's attention . He ran to the street , catching Mr. Comerford in his arms as the twine merchant wheeled unsteadily from the window . " Yea , I have cavorted with Bacchus in Elysian Fields , " Mr. Comerford said softly . A sour odor assailed Sammy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his floundering employer . He wrestled him gently to the curb and a waiting hack . " Unpleas  --  unpleas  --  unpleasant odor , Sammy ? You should n't mind the odor of ' nebriation , m'boy . Oh . Forgot you are a Hebrew . Hebrews can not abide alcohol . ' M I right ? Curious people , you Hebrews . " " Sure , sure , you are , Mr. Comerford . " Sammy shoved him through the opened door of the hansom . Seated , Mr. Comerford lurched forward , as violently as if some giant hand had slammed his back . His long arms dangled between his knees ; the brown bowler toppled to the cab 's floor . Sammy stood on the sidewalk , hesitant , embarrassed . " You think I better ride home with you , Mr. Comerford ? " " Come aboard , Sammy ! Always room for another rifleman in the old New York 88th ! " The driver winked at Sammy and jerked a thumb toward the cab interior as if to say , You 'd better go along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave the hackie the address of Mr. Cornerford 's brownstone on West 121st Street , and the horse clattered off . As abruptly as he had collapsed , Mr. Comerford suddenly jerked upward again , resting his head against the black leather seat pushion . " Curious people , the Hebrews . " He belched comfortably .  | " You said that already , Mr. Comerford . " " Did I ? Getting old . Repeat myself . " The air was warm and moist ; everything was bathed in a soft mist ; fuzzy yellow halos encircled the gaslights . The first hurdygurdy of the season was singing its ratchety serenade on the street corner . " Lovely city , " Mr. Comerford mumbled . " Delightful city . " " It 's all right , " Sammy said . " Why 'd you come here then ? Who sent for you ? " Then , sensing , some offense to his stenographer ( through drunken eyes he could still see the youth 's solemn face ) , he added , " Now , do n't m'sunderstand me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish , used to call us . Me . William Francis Comerford , billygoat Irish . " " Who called you that ? " " Old Americans . Know-nothing hoodlums . But bother me ? Never ! We showed them ! Up the Irish Brigade and General Meagher ! Showed ' em at Fredricksburg ! " " No one should insult anyone else because of their religion or nationality , " Sammy said seriously . " Right ! Don ' let ' em , Sammy ! Curious , you Hebrews . Thought I 'd never like you . But y'all right . You take some good advice , Sammy ? " " Yes , sir . " " Important thing , " Mr. Comerford said , speaking slowly and with excessively careful enunciation , " is to have identity of your own . Very important in this country . Identity . Be somebody . That 's why it was so important for me to be in Irish Brigade . We had identity . Accepted . You must do the same , Sammy . Do n't join army , ' f course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your brains . Study . Learn . Advance . Have identity . You understand ? " " I think I do , Mr. Comerford . I 'm going to night school now , making up credits ? " " Not ' nough . Set high goal . Law ? Medicine ? Teaching ? But have identity . Be a whole person . Do n't lead life of quiet desperation . Do n't get lost in swarm . " He suddenly spun about , shoving his face into Sammy 's trying , as much as his condition would allow , to look fierce and commanding  --  the young Willie Comerford , who charged the stone wall at Fredericksburg . " ' M not sure you 're absorbing all this , Sammy . You Hebrews have strange turn of mind . Quite possible you 're misinterp  --  misinmisinterpretin ' every word I say . You doin ' that ? " " No , Mr. Comerford , I understand you . "  | " Do n't think you do . " He leaned forward , slapping his hand against Sammy 's knee to underscore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mean get lost in the crowd . I mean  --  be your own self . Be strong , do n't let anyone call you billygoat Irish . " He belched as he realized the inanity of his admonition , and , with his mouth still opened wide , gulped air and resumed . " Thas ' ridiculous . Could n't call you billygoat Irish , but call you worse names . Ignore ' em . Get own identity . Fight back . " " I can take care of myself , " Sammy said . " ' M sure you can . But do n't want to see you grow up forced into mold , restricted , stifled . Need all freedom you can get , Sammy . " Like an oversized , ungainly child , Mr. Comerford was now resting his aching head in Sam Abelman 's lap . The pleasant clip-clop of the horses ' hoofs , the rhythmic creaking of the axle , was putting him to sleep . " For want of a man , there are so many men , " Mr. Comerford whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curious people , you Hebrews . " March merged gently into a hopeful April , April into an indolent May . Sammy Abelman was nineteen and restless . On Saturday nights ( he went to night school Mondays through Fridays ) he sat on the stoop of their sagging , stained tenement in Brownsville and talked with his friend , Sol Pomerantz . From where they sat , they could see green fields and the clustered treetops of Traficanti 's farm . Like hundreds of other East Siders , the Abelmans and Pomerantzes had moved to Brownsville  --  Brunsveel  --  in search of lower rents , a slightly better standard of living , and the sight of grass . Six years after the turn of the century , much of Brownsville still looked out on wide , flat plains , choked with angry weeds and stunted trees . On the flat , sandy land where an honest-to-goodness Farmer Brown had once raised - goats and geese , a new slum was burgeoning . Builders were buying up acreage as fast as they could raise the cash . Each day a new excavation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knights of the pick and shovel , brightened the neighborhood with their staccato chatter . Sol was a small , wiry youth . An immense shock of luxurious chestnut hair , dipping in graceful waves over his intense face , gave him the look of a distrustful , irate bird . His pipestem limbs and narrow body , however , were like high-tension steel . If Sam Abelman 's family had been poor , Sol Pomerantz 's were impoverished , and , thus nurtured on insufficient foods , the fibers of his body had curiously formed themselves into stringy , elastic muscles . There had  | been nothing left over for fat or flesh . Sol also was a reader . He haunted the public libraries and attended lectures . Once he had shaken hands with Edwin Markham , and twice he had listened , enraptured , as Eugene V. Debs spoke out against the crimes of capitalism . " This new book by Jack London , " he was telling Sam . " It 's the best he 's done yet . " He held it up proudly , showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked The Call of the Wild , " Sammy said . " But it takes me months to finish a novel . I 'm not a speedy reader like you , Solly. if I ever get the time , I 'll catch up with you . " " Reading is part of growing up , " Sol commented solemnly . " It 's especially important for us . To acquaint ourselves with a new environment , to be a part of it . That 's why Jack London is so great ; he 's got the feel of the whole country in his prose . " Sam saw his father approaching . Another Sabbath had ended , and he was returning from the synagogue with a few cronies . Halfway to the house , they paused . From the stylized gestures and intonations , the youths could see that the oldsters were engaged in one of their interminable Talmudic arguments . Thumbs and fingers dipped and rose , voices became agitated , a bearded participant ruffled his whiskers to underscore a telling point . " See what I mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape from that kind of thing . It 's holding us back . " Silent , Sam thought about the way his relationships with his family had unraveled in the last decade . He loved his parents ; yet they were becoming more alien to him than the goyim with whom he worked . His father , more stooped , more mute with each dragging year , lived for the tailoring shop on Ludlow Street , the crowded flat in Brownsville , the synagogue . The old man ( he was in his fifties , yet he was undeniably old ) had never in his life taken a vacation , read a book , expressed an opinion . And his mother had aged with him . The hope that the new country would rejuvenate them had been a delusion ; the habits , the pressures , the miseries of the old world were too deeply entrenched in blood and bone . The poison of decay had been injected into them in the Czar 's ghetto . If anything , the shattering , convulsive change of America had accelerated the degenerative process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and greater freedom ; but they aged faster and died earlier . Their meek submission was mirrored in the children  --  all but Samuel . Moishe , a silent , shy young man , had learned almost no English . Daily he went to his sewing machine in the shirt factory , daily he returned . The girl , Rivke , fragile and  | querulous , had married a broad-backed plumber , a gross Gall. cian with boorish manners . The youngest son , Aaron , now fourteen , showed some promise , Sam thought . He got excellent marks in school , his English was good , and he had a feverish curiosity that pleased the older brother . But he was a sickly child  --  Dr. Lemkau had told them that his heart was weak , that they should not expect him to lead a normal , active life . To Sam 's mother , he was the eternal , pampered baby : mein kind . " It 's hard for the old generation , " Sam said . " You ca n't change a whole way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a hot Socialist like you . " " Socialists are n't tolerant ! We 're world changers , Sammy . I have half a mind to organize a Yom Kippur banquet ! " " What the devil is that ? " " Back a few years ago , " Pomerantz explained , " the young radicals on the Lower East Side got fed up with all this religious junk . So on Yom Kippur , instead of fasting and hanging around the synagogue all day , they 'd rent a hall and have a huge banquet . They 'd eat pork , mix the milk and the meat , and get drunk as goyim . Just to show the old fogies that they were outdated . They 'd advertise the feast for weeks in advance , sell tickets , and buy whiskey with the proceeds . " " That 's going too far , " Sam said , scowling . " How come they stopped doing it finally ? I bet they turned everyone against them with that kind of crazy affair . " " Oh , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People still go to shul . They still fast on Yom Kippur . " " You do n't . I do n't . How many of our friends do ? " " We 're the younger generation , Solly . We 're in a new environment , adopting new ideas . " " So ! " cried Pomerantz , holding his hands out to prove he had won his point , " you agree with me ! " " 1 do n't really . I have nothing against anyone who wants to stick with the old ways . That 's their privilege . Just like its mine to break away . Furthermore , even though I do n't go to shill any more , I 'm still aware of my identity as a Jew . 1 do n't go screaming it to everyone , but I do n't reject it . You do n't go bragging about your arms or legs , but you do n't deny they exist either . " Sol leaped up the stoop , sitting beside him . He whipped from under his arm a folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to a column facing the editorial page . " Okay , Mr. Identity , " Pomerantz said , " let 's see if you have any bright ideas today . Ever read John Sylvanus ' - column ? "  | " I glance at it sometimes . " John Sylvanus was the pseudonym for a journalist-nature lover who conducted a daily column in the World . He reported on larks and lizards , wild mustard , and Norway maples with splendid impartiality . No field mouse , no Mourning Cloak butterfly escaped his watchful eye . In addition , John Sylvanus ' column served as free advertising space for innumerable hiking clubs , vereins , naturalists ' societies , and assorted groupings of outdoor folk . It was particularly popular with young immigrants , who availed themselves of John Sylvanus ' generosity to organize social clubs . " Let 's start our own club , " Sol said earnestly . " We 'll put in a free advertisement , asking young people with literary and outdoor interests to meet us at Jackson 's Lot a week from tomorrow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand against the folded newspaper . " I 'm writing in to the paper today ! And I 'm signing both our names to it . We 'll call the first meeting for next Sunday , right ? " " Go ahead , if it will keep you happy , " Sam said . " See you Sunday , Sammy ! And bring lunch ! " He bounded away joyfully . From the narrow tenement door , Sam 's mother emerged . She was shepherding Aaron , her youngest son . He was , , garrying a paper hag filled with leftovers under one arm , and a chipped tureen of soup under the other . The food was being dispatched to her daughter hivke  --  a gesture dictated as much by charity as by the mother 's need for binding her vanishing family together . She spoke in Yiddish to Sam . " Sam , help Aaron carry this to Rivke 's . It 's a long way and it 's getting dark . " " Ah , mama , it 's two blocks . What is he , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , the bluish lips , the black hair growing stringly at the ears and nape of the neck . He regretted his words , and he understood they stemmed from his own sorrow at Aaron 's weakness . " Who needs you ? " Aaron said quickly . He had bright , quick eyes : there was no sickness in them . " I 'll show you who ! " He jumped from the stoop , and squaring off , boxer-fashion , started to flick short left jabs  --  each missing by a fraction  --  in the direction of his brother 's nose . It was a game they played constantly . Aaron giggled , bobbing his head to avoid the blows that would never land . Sam took the bundle of food and they walked off . He glanced over his shoulder at his mother . Her face was a fretwork of age and toil ; hair , features , and clothes  | were a smudge of dull gray . He winced inwardly , thinking of the pathetic frailty of his people . They gave in , they surrendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solly was right : you had to learn , to adapt , to expand . It was a classic May morning , the air clear and thin , a faint breeze ruffling the luxurious weeds surrounding Jackson 's Lot . Sol Pomerantz ' notice in John Sylvanus ' column had called the meeting for ten in the morning , but , at half-past eleven , the two organizers were the only applicants present . They sat on a huge boulder , the site Sol had designated as a gathering point , and waited . They were dressed for the outdoor adventure in old neckband shirts without collars , old trousers , and tennis shoes . Each had brought his lunch in a shoebox : hard-boiled eggs , fragrant onion rolls layered with sweet butter , tomatoes from Traficanti 's farm , thick slices of honeycake , and a quart bottle of milk . Disconsolate , they waited on the sun-warmed rock , watching a lazy game of tennis doubles . A noon , they began to eat their lunches , an act both sensed signified the failure of their project . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop drained from the milk bottles . The sun was at its height , and they sweated freely on the hot rock . Sam stood on the boulder , shading his eyes . " Let 's give it five more minutes , Sol . Then we 'll take our own hike . You can tell me all about Jack London  --  for the tenth time . " At that moment he spied a party of seven or eight young people walking toward them , from the direction of the trolley line . They wore light , informal clothes , and each carried a paper bag or box . " Hey , Solly , cheer up ! Business ! " He leaped from the boulder , and the two organizers went out to meet the arrivals . " Good morning , I 'm sure , " said Sol . " Are you folks by any chance the ones who read the notice in John Sylvanus ' column ? " There were eight of them : four youths and four girls . Like Sol and Sam , the boys wore collarless shirts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ' girls were dressed in white shirtwaists and tight , dark skirts ; their thick halos of hair were gathered at the neck in bright ribbons . A tall youth , blond hair neatly parted in the middle and combed in delicate twin scallops , shook hands limply with Sol and Sam . He appeared to be the group leader . " Delighted to meet you . I 'm Louis Kosloff . " He took from his breast pocket a pair of pince-nez , and in a gesture intended to  | impress the strangers fixed them on his nose with a professorial tweak . " We 're all members of a club of our own in Williamsburg , " Kosloff continued , " and we thought it might be valuable to meet another group with similar interests . Are there just two of you ? " His tone indicated disappointment . " Yes , " Pomerantz said , " just Sam Abelman and myself . We thought we 'd gather together a nice congenial group . " " Just two of you , " Kosloff repeated unhappily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . That 's why we 're so late . " There was an uncomfortable pause . Clearly the Williamsburg contingent was distressed by the thin ranks of the Brownsville chapter . One boy kicked a stone , two of the girls stared at Sam and began to giggle . He flushed in embarrassment . One of the girls stepped forward . " Well , really , Louis , " she said softly , " it does n't matter . I 'm sure these gentlemen had the best of motives . What 's the difference if there are only two . I 'll bet they can take us on a lovely walk . Rome was not built in a day , Louis . " She was slim , yet gently rounded , Sam noticed uncomfortably . Her waist was pinched the tightest of all the girls , and her skin was white and smooth . Her v4ce had a cultured and delicate lilt clearly a girl who read a la and worked hard at improving herself , " I 'm Sarah Malkin , " she said , " and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hilda Myerson , and Eva Cohen . Let 's see , you know Louis , so why do n't you other boys introduce yourselves ? " The Williamsburg contingent shook hands vigorously . Only the blond , bespectacled leader remained faintly aloof . But Sarah 's diplomacy had saved the day . Soon they were joking and exchanging biographical data . Sol suggested they walk along King 's Highway , a dirt footpath winding through wide pastures and scattered farms . Sam found himself walking with Sarah Malkin , but it was soon evident that he would have to share her with Kosloff . The lanky young man made it clear that no Brownsville upstart could monopolize his girl . They strolled at a leisurely pace . Wagons creaked by them , moving slothfully in the spring warmth ; butterflies skipped and ( lanced in the high grass . " What do you do for a living , Abelman ? " Kosloff asked sharply . " I 'm a stenographer for a downtown firm , " he said hesitantly . " But I 'm studying at Normal College nights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not sure , " he said . " Medicine , maybe . Or teaching . " " Louis goes to CCNY , " Sarah said . " He 's studying to be an English teacher . " Kosloff favored Sam with an indulgent smile . " How do you manage to absorb anything at night school ? Do n't you sometimes - think it 's just wasted time and motion ? " " Maybe , " said Sam . " I ca n't afford day college . " " It seems to me , " Sarah said , " that you get out of education what you put into it . Day or night , it does n't really matter . " " Tell me , Abelman , " Kosloff said , " what made you and this . other chap  --  what 's his name  --  organize this group ? " " It was Sol 's idea , " Sam said . He hated having to defend the project . He had entered into it unwillingly , and now he had to take . on the big brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an animated argument about Debs ' role in the Pullman strike with one of - the new boys . " Well , which of you is the literary expert ? " Kosloff persisted . " Sol reads a lot , " Sam said . " Yes , I 'll bet he does . Old King Brady and The Yaller Kid . " Sam stopped walking , and Sarah and Kosloff , noticing that he - was lagging , halted and turned . " Look , Professor Kosloff , " Sam said acidly , " you can beat it right now if you do n't like this arrangement . We ca n't help it if we were the only ones in the club , and we ca n't help it if you were too dumb to take the right trolley . We ca n't help it either if you do n't like to walk . If you get tired let me know , and I 'll carry you . " Kosloff looked down his nose through the fragile pince-nez ; he had the appearance of an offended greyhound . " Do n't get so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know male stenographers were so tough . " Sam advanced a step . Then , realizing that it would have been neither mannerly nor purposeful to pursue the argument , he halted . " Aah , to heck with it , " he said , and turned his back . Sarah was at his side in an instant . " Now , really , Samuel , " she said , " you 're both being childish . " She was a born mediator ; moderation , discretion , and calm deliberation were her watchwords . " Louis is really not a bad fellow . He 's very artistic and high-strung . He writes poetry , and I 'm sure he 'll read to us when we stop for lunch . " They found a raised plateau beneath a grove of lindens , pin . oaks , and poplars . They mingled Emerson and Whittier with hardboiled eggs and seeded rolls ; Poe and Longfellow spiced the farmer-  | cheese sandwiches and the buttered slabs of pumpernickel . Sam and Sol , victims of their own impatience , willingly accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time for Louis to recite , " said Hilda Meyerson . She was a dumpy little redhead , and her dark eyes rolled about too frequently for Sam 's comfort . " Do n't encourage him , he will , " one of the Williamsburg boys said . " What 'll it be , Louis , The Face on the Barroom Floor ' ? " another asked . Sam was feeling better about things . Louis , in spite of his CCNY education , his pince-nez , and his poetry , was not immune to gibes ; maybe even Sarah was aware of his vulnerability . Kosloff , supine on the thick grass , raised himself to a sitting position , clasping soft hands about his knees . With evident disdain , he put aside his book of poems , underscoring the fact that he would recite from memory . When he spoke his voice had a deep luster ; he would make a superb English teacher . " ' The Raven , ' " he began , " by Edgar Allen Poe . " Sol Pomerantz glowered from beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  something that sang of revolution and man 's highest hopes . He made a point to memorize some Markham for their next meeting . " ' Once upon a midnight dreary , while I pondered weak and weary ... " Sarah was listening raptly , her small round chin resting on her clasped hands . Leaning over to whisper in her ear  --  the group was determinedly silent while Kosloff intoned his offering  --  Sam murmured , " I wish he 'd quit his Raven . " She looked up at him sharply with a fierce " Shh ! " But she was smiling appreciatively at his appalling pun . He felt that his jest had been as well , if not better , received than the poet laureate 's recital . It was evening when he brought Sarah home . Kosloff , her escort at the start of the long Sunday , had grown exhausted on the return hike . The Ralph Avenue trolley took them to Williamsburg , an older , more crowded Jewish settlement . He made no effort to hold hands with Sarah . Instead they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests . Sarah 's parents were Litvaks , from Vilna ;  | Jews with a modern , progressive outlook . Her father had a small jobbing business , distributing tea and coffee to Brooklyn grocery stores . She worked as a secretary for the MacReady Elevator Company on Vesey Street ; she was seventeen and liked to read . They walked slowly to the yellow brick tenement where she lived , anxious to prolong the evening , aware that the prying eyes of parents and neighbors would hasten his departure . " I enjoyed this day very much , " Sam said haltingly . " You are a very interesting person to talk to . " " You are too , Sam , " she said . " You have a fine sense of humor . " " Will you come to the club 's next hike ? " he asked . " Say , I 'll bet if we start early we can go to the Palisades or something like that . " " Oh , I 'm sure I will . I think the Cloverleafs had a wonderful time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notice again . " He looked intently at her . " I do n't care if we stay just as we are . I do n't need any more members . " Her father was waiting on the stoop . He was a tall , portly man , beard clipped short , neatly squared and combed like a Russian grand duke 's . He wore a black silk vest and a high square skullcap . Seated on a wire-backed chair , his hands resting on a silver-headed ebony cane , he was clearly the neighborhood elder , a man not to be crossed or snubbed . Sarah spoke to her father in Yiddish . She addressed him with evident respect . He was a sheyneh yid , Sam was sure , a man who held an honored seat on the Eastern Wall of the temple . " Father , this is my new friend , Samuel Abelman . " The ebony cane tapped authoritatively on the stone stoop . " Abelman ? I do n't know any Abelmans . " His basso profundo indicated that this circumstance reduced the youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squinted through the street lamp 's half light at the black-haired young man . " You 're a Litvak ? " " No , sir , my parents came from Bessarabia . Near Kishinev . " Malkin the elder flipped the eyeglasses back in position . " H000y ! A Rumanian ! " If he had referred to his daughter 's new acquaintance as a Cossack , he could not have sounded more annihilating . His rudeness embarrassed Sarah and she blushed . But neither the patriarch 's unprovoked insult nor the fact that he was without carfare and faced an hour 's walk to Brownsville troubled young Sammy Abelman . He would see Sarah next Sunday and for many Sundays to come . Love , nurtured by Whitman , Lanier , and Longfellow , would bloom amidst the tenements.  | Through the oppressive summer , the walking-and-literary club continued its excursions into the green pastures of the city and the prose and poetry of America . Sammy remained in the employ of Mr. Comerford , but there were portents of doom in the stifling office of the twine merchant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers , dwindling sales . And more and more , Mr. Comerford seemed not to hear the bookkeeper . Unquestionably , he was looking pale and spent during the breathless August days . The Saturday before Labor Day , Mr. Comerford did not appear at the office until early afternoon . He arrived , or rather was helped to his desk by his eldest son , a meaty man with thick brown burnsides and the coarse friendliness of a Tammany sachem . Mr. Comerford 's creamy linen suit was disheveled . His eyes were dim and teary behind the gold-rimmed glasses and he exuded a corrupt alcoholic odor , as if the liquor within him was vaporizing through his limbs . " Now , Billy , " Mr. Comerford told his son , " do n't you lecture your daddy . I am in complete command of my faculties . Am I right , Sammy ? Sammy understands me . " The stenographer walked to his employer 's desk , pushing the green eyeshact back on his forehead . " Can I help you , Mr. Comerford ? Would you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Billy said . He sat down wearily at the side of his father 's scarred desk . " B'Jesus , you 'd think he 'd have a new desk around here . Who 'd place an order in a slum like this ? Sammy , do n't you or Hanratty ever air this joint out ? " " It 's all the ventilation we can get here , Mr. Comerford . All the doors and windows are open . " Young Comerford loosened his stiff collar and removed his checked jacket . It had light-gray velvet lapels ; a pink carnation bloomed in one eyelet . " Ah , it 's no matter any longer . " He turned to Hanratty . " Michael , fetch me the books for the last quarter . Sammy , call in the boys from the stock room and the shipping department . Everybody . " The elder Comerford had appeared to be dozing . Now he jerked himself upright in the ancient swivel chair . " I shall handle this affair , Billy , " he said stiffly . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sammy , " Billy said sharply . " Call them in . " They gathered in a respectful semicircle around the old man 's desk . Mr. Comerford had slumped back in his chair in a semi-stupor . Billy sat on the edge of the desk and gazed reflectively through the dust-stained window onto lower Broadway .  | " What I have to say is not very pleasant , so I 'll be brief , " Billy began . " As you know , Mr. Comerford 's business has not been doing too well . Competition is getting tougher , costs are up . A lot of our line , quite frankly , is outdated . There are other problems , but why should I bother going into them ? " Mr. Comerford raised his hand as if to interrupt his son . Then he lowered it and moaned . " Last Tuesday , my brother and I went over the company books and decided that Mr. Comerford could no longer stay in business . We have filed a petition for bankruptcy , and , as of next week , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commercial Bank . I 'm sorry you are all to lose your jobs , but we 've no choice . The banks are closed through Monday , so why do n't you all come in Wednesday and Hanratty will have your last pay envelopes . " No one spoke . One of the stock-room boys , a bloated Irishman who supported a wife , a mother , and six children , crossed himself and muttered , " Holy Mary , Mother of God . " Sammy said nothing . He knew it was not his place to speak . There was some uncertain shuffling of feet . Hanratty cleared his throat and took a step forward . " May I say for the boys , Mr. Comerford , we 're sorry as can be this happened . " The shriveled little bookkeeper was sniffling , Sammy noticed . He felt a sudden rush of pity for Hanratty  --  the man was n't all meanness . He was genuinely fond of old Comerford . The twine merchant smiled . " Why , Michael , that 's a very nice sentiment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might as well clean up and take off the rest of the day . I hope you all get work real quick . " " Just a minute , Billy , " Mr. Comerford said . " Grant me at least a soldier 's farewell to his troops . " The workmen , at the door of the stock room , halted . Sammy and Hanratty drew closer to the desk . " Failure is not a pleasant circumstance , " Mr. Comerford began . " Oh , for Christ 's sake , papa ? " " That 's all right , Billy . I am clear of mind and firm of purpose . But if I have failed , I should like to think it is not because of some defect of character , but rather through a minor weakness . . . one which will not , I trust , bring on the contempt of my fellow men . Let us call it inflexibility . The practices of trade have changed since my boyhood . Instead of learning them , I read Thoreau . When a man falls out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel neglected . He falls out of his own volition . He can not blame  | his fellow men or what they have made of society . So I leave my business , and you , my associates , with no feeling of persecution . Each of us must cherish some small illusion when fortune turns against him . Mine is that I have been honest . " " Ah , papa , that 's enough , " Billy interrupted . " I 'll take you home . " He ignored his son . " The best that can be said of illusions is that sometimes they transcend their fictitious nature and cross the line into reality . I trust my illusions are of that quality . " He rose from the desk , turning theatrically to the Civil War memorabilia on the mahogany wall . " A case in point on man 's illusions , " Mr. Comerford said huskily . " General Meagher , the proud commander of the Irish Brigade . For years after I fought under him , I believed implicitly in his heroism . Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hero ? And yet , years later , I read accounts of Fredericksburg where it was proven that General Meagher had left the field of battle early under the pretext of having been wounded . He was never wounded . He had never been under heavy fire . Yet the image of my hero persisted . I preferred to remember my commander as he looks on that old picture , not as some historian has portrayed him . " He stumbled , and for an instant it appeared he would collapse . Billy and Hanratty helped him to the door . They stood in the blinding summer sunlight waiting for a hack . Sammy , stunned by the events of th , afternoon , walked out and joined them . " Sammy , I shall be happy to give you the highest reference , ' Mr. Comerford said . " I suspect you will not long be a simple stenographer . You have ambition , strength , and a clear mind . " Sammy hesitated before speaking . His request , one which he had harbored for several months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's disaster . " Mr. Comerford , " he said , " I 'm very sorry about what happened . If you want me to work next week , to help clean up ? " " That 's all right , Sammy , " Billy said . " The bank is sending their own people over . Hanratty 'll stay on a few days . " A hack drew up , and the door swung open . " Mr. Comerford , " Sammy continued , " do you remember I told you about a kind of literary group of young people ? You know , how my friends and myself go for walks and discuss famous writers ? " " Oh , for Christ 's sweet sake , " Billy said . " Let 's get going . " " Well , I was wondering , Mr. Comerford , if you 'd join us tomorrow and lecture to us on Thoreau . We have had some very interesting discussions . Mr. Madison from the Henry Street Settlement spoke on Whitman last week . And the assistant principal of Boys '  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to get a guest speaker and I thought maybe ? " " Sammy , Mr. Comerford is tired and is n't feelin ' well , " Billy said sharply . " He 's in no mood to be takin ' nature hikes and lecturing . " Mr. Comerford shook himself loose from his son 's arm . " Quite the contrary , Sammy . Your invitation makes me feel brighter already . I shall be honored to speak to your young friends . " his step seemed springier , his eyes sharper as he climbed into the cab . " Can you meet us at South Ferry at ten in the morning , Mr. Comerford ? " Sammy called , as the horse trotted off . " We 're going to Staten Island ! " " With my lunch under my arm ! " the twine merchant called back . Overlooking Great Kills Harbor , the literary club lolled on a tree-shaded plain . Sam and Sarah Malkin rested against a gnarled Norway maple ; in semisolitary grandeur Louis Kosloff composed couplets . He had taken to wearing a flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pince-nez . Coatless , Mr. Comerford sat on a folding camp chair ( Sammy had rented it for the occasion and carried it himself ) and opened his edition of Miscellanies . " People equate Thoreau with Walden , " Mr. Comerford began , " but since I am sure that this learned assemblage has already mastered the philosophy of that well-known work , I shall choose a different text for my sermon . " Eva Cohen and Hilda Meyerson giggled , and Sarah looked at them reproachfully . They were both exceedingly pretty girls , and Sarah suspected they had joined the group only to augment their friendships with young men . Mr. Comerford knotted a red silk handkerchief around his neck and resumed . " I shall read first from Life Without Principle . When I have concluded my reading you may ask questions of me . " He read haltingly , as if somewhat confused by his role as teacher to these alien children , but they listened with profound gravity . Any scrap of learning was treasured . The lore of the new country had replaced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money almost without exception lead downward , ' " Mr. Comerford began . " To have done anything by which you earned money merely is to have been truly  | idle or worse . If the laborer gets no more than the wages which his employer pays him , he is cheated , he cheats himself . If you would get money as a writer or lecturer , you must be popular , which is to go down perpendicularly . Those services which the community will most readily pay for , it is most disagreeable to render . You are paid for being something less than a man . The State does not commonly reward a genius any more wisely . Even the poet laureate would rather not have to celebrate the accidents of royalty . He must be bribed with a pipe of wine ; and perhaps another poet is called away from his muse to gauge that very pipe . As for my own business , even that kind of surveying which I would do with most satisfaction my employers do not want . ' " Mr. Comerford paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I resume , would anyone like to comment ? " " It seems to me , " Louis Kosloff said , " that he is far too pessimistic . When he says that the ways of earning money all lead downward , he is n't setting much hope for us . I mean , young people like ourselves who wish to get ahead . " The twine merchant closed the book gently , using his thumb as a marker , and nodded slowly . " In a sense , he was a pessimist , " Mr. Comerford said , " but , like Dr. Johnson , he was , in his way , a pessimist with an enormous zest for living . " He had n't really answered Kosloff 's question , and Sam , sensing that his guest lecturer had been evasive , jumped in . " Louis , when you read Thoreau you realize he always said things in the extreme to make people pay attention . When he says the ways of making money lead down , he wants you to sit up and listen , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay , earn a living , but do something fruitful , rewarding . Do n't just work for the sake of money . Is that right , Mr. Comerford ? " He reopened the book . " You must have been reading this essay , Sammy . It 's the very next part . Thoreau writes , ... it would be economy for a town to pay its laborers so well that they would not feel they were working for low ends , as for a livelihood merely , but for scientific or even moral ends . Do not hire a man who does your work for money , but him who does it for love of it . ' " Mr. Comerford tilted a glass jug to his lips and sipped tepid water . " And as you read him and learn to appreciate him , pray that some of his hard sense touches you . I have found Thoreau a com4ort and a guide for many , many years . " " Is n't there a lot of the escapist in him ? " Sol Pomerantz asked .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beset with terrible injustices and problems . Are n't we duty-bound to rise up against them , instead of looking for muskrats and loons ? " " Escapist ? My boy , Thoreau went to jail for what he believed in . He stood up and was counted when the slavery issue came to a head . " Mr. Comerford looked slyly at Pomerantz , shrewdly gauging the young man 's turn of mind . " He was a revolutionary , yes , but his own particular kind of rebel . He would join no causes and follow no banners . But he preached a radical doctrine , you may be sure . When he said simplify , he was striking at the roots of our society . Imagine ! Tons of paper work , memoranda , newspapers , aimless possessions , and useless social functions , swept away , if all of us were to follow his advice ! " Sam watched the old man as his voice trailed off . He was thinking of the bookshelf behind the mahogany desk ; the long sad afternoons in the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and General Meagher , who had never really been a hero . " And may I impart one cautionary word , " Mr. Comerford said , as if roused from a reverie . " Take your Thoreau in small doses . Do not try to swallow him whole . If you permit your entire life to be guided by his precepts , you will fall out of step , perhaps forever . A man may be out of step with his fellow men , Thoreau said , because he is listening to a different drummer . But the trouble today is that this different drummer may cause you to fall so far behind the line of march you will never catch up . So use your Thoreau sparingly . Listen to the different drummer now and then , but do not fall out of the parade altogether . " They were silent . Not all of them understood the old man 's lecture fully , but they knew he had imparted to them something of himself . Below them , in Raritan Bay , a steamboat whistle broke the summer quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentinel lindens and poplars ; it was turning cool in the natural classroom where the ghetto children listened to the veteran of Fredericksburg . Few moments of triumph would come to William Comerford in his remaining years on earth ; but in his brief role as teacher to the young aliens he understood that something had been illuminated for them that summer afternoon on Staten Island . With the collapse of Mr. Comerford 's business and his enforced retirement , Sam was unemployed . Unable to find a satisfactory job , he compromised by helping his father in the tailoring shop  | on Ludlow Street . The new line of waiters ' jackets was being turned out , and Sam did triple duty as delivery boy , order-taker , and assistant fitter . His father did not work Saturdays and Sam took advantage of the day off to meet Sarah . They would rendezvous in Prospect Park , and the conversation , as it invariably did , turned to Sam 's future . " It 's that darn night school , " he complained . " I ca n't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study . Oh , the junk like English composition and history are easy enough . But the sciences ! I 'm way behind in chemistry ! " She slipped an arm through his . Such demonstrations of affection were forbidden at the meetings of the literary group . But alone , far from the jealous eyes of Louis Kosloff , who still envisioned himself as a contestant for Sarah 's soft hand , they indulged their love . " Well , I think you should make your mind up . You ought to take a full year off from work . Borrow the money for school and get all the credits you need for medical college . " " So who pays for medical school ? It 's four years , and the tuition with books and everything is more than two hundred dollars a year . " They rested on a concrete bench . It was early morning , and the park was virtually empty . A policeman ambled by slowly , eying them with bl ud contempt . Several well-dressed small boys with the inbred blond faces of Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be engulfed by the waves of immigrants  --  ran by . A sweltering German governess followed them . " Sam , what in the world is that ? " Sarah asked . He looked first at the small boys who had run by , then realized she was pointing toward a sunken grassy plain , where a group of young men appeared to be walking on their hands . Sam shrugged . " Search me . It 's five fellows walking on their hands . I guess that 's their privilege , since we live in a democracy . It 's their America too . " " Oh , let 's see why they 're doing it ! " she cried . They walked down the slope toward the hand-walkers . The gymnasts wore identical uniforms : soiled white tennis shoes , white duck trousers , and white athletic shirts with red piping around the throat . One of them , still ambulant on palms , came to a stop and then did an artful flip , landing on his feet . On the front of the shirt ( it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters " CC . " " What does the CC stand for ? " Sam asked . " Cubic centimeters ? " The young man folded a pair of arms the color and consistency  | of oak beams across an abnormally developed chest and eyed the visitor coldly . He was a man in his late thirties , with the look of a tethered falcon about him . A thatch of red hair fell on either side of his bony head . Thick tufts of the same red growth overhung his fierce eyes and grew in a great irregular patch over his upper lip . But for all his feral appearance , his voice was high-pitched and almost apologetic . " Now that was n't very nice , " he said . " You know very well that is n't the case and you said it to be funny . Probably to impress the lady . " " I did n't mean any harm , " Sam said . " Just a little joke . " " It is not my idea of fun to make jokes about educational institutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry . I did n't know you were having a study period here . I just mean to be sociable . " He gestured to Sarah and they turned to leave . " Just a minute , young fellow , " the redheaded acrobat said , his voice getting higher and squeakier . " Where did you get those deltoids ? For that matter your pronators and supinators are n't bad either . " " My who ? " Sam asked . Smiling , he shook a finger at the chief hand-walker . " There are ladies present and you 're getting very personal . " The muscular man leaped to Sam 's side , and with iron fingers began probing his biceps and shoulders , like a woman examining a chicken . " You are in rather good shape , my boy . Have you read my book on muscle vibration ? " " I  --  ah  --  I do n't think I have , " said Sam . " What 's your name ? Maybe I 've seen it in the library . " He stepped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don his mask . " Hector O'Bannion , president and dean of Chelsea College of Physical Education . These gentlemen developing muscle vibrations are my senior class . " " Just four of them ? " Sarah asked incredulously . " I accept only those students who can live up to the rigors of my curriculum . Besides a thorough education in the well-being of the body , we teach the arts , the sciences , and the social graces . " He fixed Sam with a predator 's eye . " What about yourself ? In need of education ? Anxious to further yourself ? The New York City Board of Education has cited me twice for the excellence of my gymnasium teachers . If you can pass the entrance examination , you can get a teacher 's certificate in two years . " i  | Sam and Sarah exchanged puzzled glances . " But  --  but  --  I was thinking of medicine as a career , " Sam said . " I do n't particularly want to teach . " " Medicine ! " O'Bannion cried . " Pill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temple of your body . I can see you are endowed with strength and wisdom . Come to Chelsea College and make a career for yourself . Learn a philosophy of life with us ! " Sam shook his head . " It does n't matter , Mr. O'Bannion . I ca n't afford the tuition anyway , and if I could , I would n't spend it to become a teacher . But I sure admired the way you jumped around and walked on your hands . " O'Bannion 's steel trap of a hand reached out again and clutched Sam 's wrist . " Less hastily , young man , " he said . " What can you do for a living , right at this moment ? " " I 'm a pretty good stenographer , " Sam said . " Splendid ! " cried O'Bannion , " you may work your way through Chelsea as my own personal secretary ! " " But I ? " " You will report for classes Monday at nine in the morning . We can work out a method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time ! " The four other young men , all wearing the same ragged shirts with the ckimson " CC 's " on the front , were upright now and were smiling at Sam and Sarah . He noticed they were a pleasantly conglomerate group : one had the square , blond look of a Scandinvian , another the pugnacious friendliness of an Irishman ; the other two were nondescript , but were evidently not Jewish . " Gosh , Mr. O'Bannion , " Sam said , looking for help to Sarah , " I ca n't make any promises . I have n't even taken your entrance examination . How do you know I can qualify ? " " Indian hand wrestle ? " O'Bannion asked abruptly . He staked out his right foot alongside Sam 's and extended his open right hand toward the unwilling adversary . " Okay , " said Sam absent-mindedly . They grasped hands and began to bend their strength against each other . O'Bannion was incredibly strong ; Sam could feel the power coursing from his massive shoulders and chest into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet for the first few moments , neither budged an inch . O'Bannion 's face turned a flaming red , his orange mustache bristled and rose from his upper lip . He had not bargained for so much resistance from the young man with the admirable deltoids . But if O'Bannion was surprised , Sam was confounded . He had never met his equal at Indian hand wrestle , but pitted against  | O'Bannion he felt he could no more move the gymnast than he could budge the Brooklyn Bridge . The veins swelled in his forehead , sweat poured from his head and collected in a pool at the juncture of his collarbones . They made brief , hesitant jerks , grunting with the effort , and still neither gave way . Suddenly , with deft deceitfulness , O'Bannion relaxed his grip and yanked his arm backward . The unexpected termination of resistance caused Sam to lurch forward clumsily , and as he did O'Bannion tightened his grip again , and with one magnificent , sweeping thrust of his right arm jerked the opponent from his feet and hurled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and smiled . He was a little annoyed that O'Bannion had tricked him . Rising , he heard Sarah 's disapproving tsk-tsks as she dusted the grass and dirt from his trousers . " My boy , " said O'Bannion solemnly , " you have just passed your entrance examination . I shall look for you on Monday . " The semester at Chelsea College was not scheduled to start until late in September . But Hector O'Bannion , president and dean , was so enamored with the notion of having his own secretary that he hired Sammy immediately , paying him four dollars a week . When the school term started , the gymnasium teacher did not discontinue the stipend ; he understood the poverty of his new student and the sacrifice he was making . Sam had raised the matter with him , offering to work without pay under the terms of their original agreement , but O'Bannion would not hear of it . The new student realized that the four dollars he received every Friday could have been put to excellent use by the president-dean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the converted stable where the college was located from falling into complete disrepair . Sam had inveigled Sol Pomerantz to enroll at the College of Physical Education with him , and the young revolutionary joined him each morning for the long trolley ride across the bridge and to West Twenty-fifth Street where O'Bannion ran his haphazard school . And yet it was not quite as ridiculous as it seemed at first blush . The ancient stable , with its sloping floors and drafty corridors , was kept immaculately clean . On the ground floor , taking advantage of the high ceiling , was the gym itself : a jungle of rings , bars , horses , and ropes . O'Bannion himself taught all the athletic courses . He was an avid student of the Swedish school of gymnastics , and Sam and Sol were soon executing giant swings and the other stylized maneu-  | vers . O'Bannion also taught calisthenics , playground games , folk dancing , and the standard sports  --  basketball , handball , volleyball . There was only one other instructor besides O'Bannion . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics , and biology through rattling false teeth and a tobaccostained white beard . His combined classroom-laboratory , held to gether with electrician 's tape and assorted nuts and bolts ( Sam was always being called upon to perform maintenance chores ) , smelled of his cheap cigars , a circumstance which distressed O'Bannion . The president-dean advocated Spartan living : he eschewed tobacco , alcohol , coffee , tea , and meat . Vegetarian and abstainer , O'Bannion sought , with limited success , to instill in his pupils his own dietary rules . To entice them into the healthful pastures of vegetarianism , he served inexpensive lunches for the student body . A buffet of carrots , lettuce , and pulverized whole wheat was always available at noontime . Pitchers of fresh milk and bowls of fresh fruit were also provided , and , for the impoverished students , the nominal charge of ten cents for as much food as they could absorb was a distinct boon . Sam , transferring his credits from his night classes at Normal College , remained at Chelsea for the full two-year course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tailoring shop , and he dreamed of respectabili and a place in the community . But even with his new certificate st  --  ting he was a qualified teacher of physical education , and an appointment as a summertime playground instructor , he was not certain of his goal . Hector O'Bannion 's diatribes against medicine had not really swayed him from his original hope of becoming a doctor . Rather it was the thought of four more years of schooling , the part-time jobs he would need , the endless studying that had caused him to surrender his hopes for a medical career . He was thinking now of another year of college , a baccalaureate degree , and certification as a full-time teacher in the city school system . In June of 1908 , Sam Abelman and Sol Pomerantz , the two newest members of the city 's playground staff , rode the trolley to a public school in Red Hook , a neighborhood where the traditions of hoodlumism were deeply rooted . The mores of Red Hook demanded flouting of the law , and the weaker the symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tormented . The two new instructors were aware of Red Hook 's notoriety . But Hector O'Bannion 's assurances that a strong right arm could handle any playground rebellion buoyed them as they rode out . When they arrived , the playground was empty . The concrete pavement cooked beneath the summer sun . Little bubbles of tar  | erupted between the sidewalk cracks , and the morning sky glinted on spiked cast-iron fencing . The two instructors toured their steaming empire , eager to impart their knowledge of physical education , of sports and good sportsmanship to the children of Red Hook . The challenge was hurled at them from the filthy red brick tenements , from the squalid streets , from the sodden drunks sleeping in doorways . Completing their brief survey , they were met at the gate by a deceptively fat young man with a pink bald head . Slung over his shoulder was a lumpish olive-drab bag , which gave him the look of a beardless Santa Claus . " You Abelman and Pomerantz ? " he asked . " That 's us , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm Charlie McDevitt , district supervisor for playgrounds . This is your gear . Basketballs , volleyballs , handballs , Indian clubs . You 're personally responsible for the equipment . If it 's lost or stolen , it 's deducted from your salaries . " Sam scratched his head . " Are these kids in the habit of stealing ? " McDevitt dumped the bag at Sam 's feet . " These kids will steal anything . Do n't turn your backs for too long , or you 'll be catching rocks . " Sol squinted under the great shock of chestnut hair . " How do you keep from turning your back in an open playground ? " The district supervisor smiled , showing a row of magnificent alabaster teeth . He seemed delighted by the distress of his new subordinates . " You ca n't really , Solly . Use your fists when you have to , and keep moving . Lock the joint up at five o'clock . Do n't take any wooden nickels . " He walked off whistling . Through the opened gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sol greeted them cheerfully , trying to overcome the sullen glances . The youngsters had the peaked , dirty look of the slum . At ten o'clock there were enough children present for the organization of games . Sol took a younger group and started a game of club-snatch . When they tired of this , an underleg basketball relay was begun ; soon a volleyball game was under way . A half-dozen little girls in pigtails were jumping rope . At the rear of the playground , parallel to the high iron fence , was a basketball court , the cracked concrete hot as an oven . Sam took a party of five boys to the court . They ranged in age from twelve to fifteen . After some preliminary shooting and dribbling , they started a three-man game : Sam and the two youngest boys against the other three . The burning sky was merciless , but theyplayed with the defiant vigor of sidewalk athletes .  | Sam played well ; Hector O'Bannion had neglected nothing in his ramshackle college . Dribble , pass , shoot , weave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay it up , throw it back . They repeated the intricate rhythms of the game for almost an hour , losing track of the score , abandoning themselves  --  instructor and boys  --  to the pure delight of using their bodies . So absorbed were they in the game that Sam failed to notice his audience . A cluster of older boys had collected outside the iron fence , watching the game with bland , insolent faces . Pausing for a brief rest , Sam noticed them , remembered McDevitt 's warning , and decided to try the friendly approach . " You fellows like to join the game ? " he asked pleasantly . One lean youth cocked a pimpled face at the instructor and grinned . " Not with you , Rosenberg . " " My name is n't Rosenberg , " Sam said . " It 's Sam Abelman . And I think you 're a punk . You have five men . Come in and play a little game if you 're such a hot shot . " " Go back to Russia , Rosenberg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's where ya come from , " another called . Sam clenched his fist a few times . He would have liked to wade into them , fists swinging . Already he could see his basketball players eying him curiously . They were of the gutter also ; their rules dictated that a taunt had to be answered . But he would try to ride it out without a fight ; once he antagonized them they would be his enemies throughout the summer . It would be a black mark against him in the sckool system  --  unable to maintain discipline his very first day out . " Beat it , you bums , " he said . " You want to play basketball , you 're welcome . If you 're going to stand there making faces , who needs you ? " He turned to the game again , distressed by the faint disdain on the faces of his own kids . When he dribbled through the entire opposition and curled in a beautiful one-handed shot , they failed to show any enthusiasm . Again the taunt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , now puffing a cigar butt , had started it ; the others took it up . " Oh , Rosenberg ! Oh , Rosenberg ! " " Rosenberg ! You 're a sheeny ! " He had to move . Tossing the basketball to one of his team-mates , he sprinted for the gate , rounding the corner in full career . As he did , he saw what their strategy was . Two of the boys were helping a third over the high fence . The intruder leaped to the court below , knocked the boy holding the basketball to the ground , then seized  | it and hurled it over the high fence . McDevitt 's warning ! It had been a plot to steal the ball ! Yet what was he supposed to do ? Spend the afternoon letting them insult him ? He was in a straightaway now , running as fast as he could . The hoodlums were running also . Pomerantz who had witnessed the theft , joined the chase . The skinny youth carried the trophy under his arm , and fortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a block he was panting fiercely and loping with an ungainly stride . Wobbling , he turned into a cobblestoned alley , the playground teacher a few steps behind him . Separated from his own companions , he was helpless . Sam bounded into the alley . It was a dead end ; he saw his tormenter backed against a sagging board fence , the basketball clutched under his arm . " Ya sheeny bastard , do n't touch me . My old man 'll kill ya , " he wheezed . " My brother 'll mobilize ya . " Sam walked toward him purposefully . " You 're a lousy , yellow punk , you 're yellow , yellow , yellow , you cheap bastard . And furthermore , you 're a galoot . Give me that ball . " The youth began to cry . " Give me the ball . Throw it to me and say you 're sorry . " " Ya sheeny  --  beat it ! " he sobbed . " I 'll break your arm off , " Sam said . He spit professionally on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want an apology too . " The ball bounced toward him and he scooped it under one arm . " Now I 'm going to use one arm to kick the crap out of you , " Sam said . " I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry ! " he screamed . " You 're sorry you called me Rosenberg . My name is Sam Abelman , right ? " " Yeah , you 're not Rosenberg . You 're Sam Abelman . Lemme out ! Do n't hit me ! " Sam turned his back . " I would n't dirty my hands on you , you punk . " Then , looking over his shoulder , he said , " Bring your buddies to the playground when you learn how to act like men . But stay away if you want to be a bunch of ' galoots . " Turning the corner out of the alley , he heard a window slam open above him . Instinctively , he ducked as a flower pot sailed by his head and shattered into a thousand shards on the cobblestones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way . " What did you do to him , Sam ? " " Nothing . Just made him apologize . Why should I belt him ? Maybe they 'll come and be good boys now . "  | Sol shook his head . " It 's terrible what bad social conditions can do to young people . You think they 'll give us any more trouble ? " " If they do , we 'll give it back to them . " He began dribbling with the ball ; he had a vested interest in it  --  if it were to be stolen , he recalled McDevitt saying , it would come out of his own salary . For several weeks there were no disturbances at the playground , and Sam and Sol decided they had won the battle for control of their little domain . Each day brought more children to the concrete square ; each day the young teachers taught new games to new groups . They taught them songs and folk dances , gave instruction in boxing and wrestling on a tattered stained mat which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighborhood families . There were no return visits from the " galoots . " On the weekend of July Fourth , Sam and Sol , with McDevitt 's help , organized a basketball game between a local athletic club and the instructors . They would charge admission , five cents per person , and use the proceeds to buy new equipment . The neighborhood team , composed of young men who worked on the nearby docks and a local brewery , made up in brawn and height what they lacked in skill . The instructors ' team , composed of Sam , Sol , McDevitt , and two of McDevitt 's classmates from City College , were superior in technique and finesse . It promised to be an exciting contest , and the playground , outfitted with a bank of wooden stands , was rapidly filling with people in early afternoon . Outside the gate , at a folding table , Sol sold handlettered tickets to the crowd , dropping the nickels into a small canvas bag . Gate-crashers were common at playground games , McDevitt had explained , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sold and collect the stubs as an extra safeguard . The neighborhood people had gotten to know and like the young instructor . Over their beers , they told each other , " That little Jewboy is strong as a dray-horse  --  you would n't believe a sheeny could have such muscles ! " They said it not disrespectfully , but in sincere wonder . Now , circulating among the audience  --  women in merciless skirts and constricting blouses , and men sweating in Sunday collars and striped silk shirts , he joked with them , genially refusing to book their bets . The local club was a sentimental favorite , even though the instructors , now warming up with professional grace , appeared to be a more skilled group . Sam had reached the end of the rickety grandstand , and had found not a single gate-crasher . The pack of soggy tickets in his fist made him feel good . He and Sol were proving themselves  | the best men under McDevitt 's command . They had maintained discipline , stimulated local interest , gone far beyond what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , squarely built young man lounging against the edge of the seats , Sam suddenly felt a premonition of trouble . He had become acutely sensitive to the attitudes of what he called " the professional galoot , " and now he saw some of the symptoms in the short young man . " May I have your ticket ? " he asked politely . " I got none . " Sam looked at the arrogant face . The bridge of the nose had been broken and flattened , and there were scars across the broad cheeks . " Well , I 'll have to ask you to leave , " Sam said . " I do n't wan na leave . I wan na see the game . " " Why do n't you buy a ticket ? It 's only five cents . Here , I 'll show you where . " He stepped forward , grasping the young man firmly under the elbow . " Right out in front . " He pulled away savagely . " Keep ya sheeny fingers off me , Rosenberg . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you learn that Rosenberg stuff ? " " From us , Rosenberg ! " He looked through the fence , seeing for the first time the same gang that had tormented him the first day he had been at the playground . The lean youth who had tried to steal the basketball was there , and there were at least seven others with him , all curkng and shouting . " Oh , Rosenberg ! " they chanted in unison , the skinny youth leading them like a choirmaster . " Try to throw him out , Rosenberg ! " " Yeah , Rosenberg , he 's my brother ! " the pimply one called . " Try to make him apologize , Rosenberg ! " A circle of people had run from the grandstand and had gathered around Sam and the gate-crasher . McDevitt , sensing a disturbance , left the basketball court and ran over . " What 's up , Sam ? " the supervisor asked . " It 's okay , Charlie , let me handle this , " Sam said . He walked again toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart and braced , his thumbs hooked in his high side pockets . His square head was thrust slightly forward . " Why do you have to be a galoot ? " Sam asked . " Is there a rule written somewhere that says you must behave like a hoodlum ? " He indicated the holiday audience in the stands , the circle of spectators waiting for inevitable bloodshed ( and sensing that in some  | secret way they were pleased to see him in trouble ) , and continued , " Look at all these nice people . Why do you want to ruin their fun ? " " I ai n't gon na ruin anyone but you , " the young man said . Then he added  --  a bit tentatively it seemed , " Sheeny Rosenberg . " Sam moved forward and reached for the young man 's forearms . He hoped to subdue him quickly without any fighting and escort him from the playground ; there was no point in provoking a riot . The tormenter , all slum muscle and grace , recoiled ; Sam had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and dirtied fists spring into position ; a second later it was as if someone had exploded an electric-light bulb in his face . He was stumbling backward on his heel , feeling a thousand needles stinging his offended chin . Numbness radiated through his teeth and cheeks , and a little bath of salty blood was forming inside his lower lip . He had not fallen , however , and as his head cleared he saw the gate-crasher bouncing professionally , fists in the classic boxer 's pose , the abysmal face aglow with hoodlum joy . Irrelevantly he thought : Why do they smile so much ? Who said they could be so happy about it ? The crowd had shrieked when the first blow was struck . Outside the fence , the boxer 's supporters were urging him on . " Mobilize him , Paddy ! " " Kill the sheeny bastard ! Cut his eye out ! " Sam put his hands up . He was a poor fist fighter , strong enough but neither graceful nor well trained . The truth of it was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's boxing lessons , he had been a reluctant pupil . Paddy hit him a second time with a professional left jab ? straight , fast , and with the fist grinding painfully into his right eye . The right cross struck him below the breastbone , and he grunted . Crouching low now , he was amazed to discover how quickly his eye was closing . Dimly he heard McDevitt shouting to him , asking him if he wanted help ; Pomerantz was standing at the edge of the crowd , pale and helpless . He buried his head inside hunched shoulders , and charged forward . The rush unbalanced the boxer slightly , but even falling away he struck Sam with the quick forearm . It was purely a defensive move ; but the boxer 's fist had hit against something harder and tougher than it had encountered in any gymnasium or ring . The pain made him flex and unflex his left fingers sympathetically , and the gesture was not lost on Sam .  | More confident , Sam tred the rush again , head down , fists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and body . He had the satisfaction of feeling his right land flush on the pugilist 's chest ; but in that instant the authoritative left jab found his teeth again , the right cracked against his cheek and made a noise like two wooden slats being slapped together . He shook his head and a spray of blood issued from his mouth . Already his new white gym shirt was speckled with red dots . " Knock him down , Paddy ! " he heard them shouting . " Go ' head , Paddy , that sheeny 's yellow ! " " Knock him on his ass ! Go on , Rosenberg , fight back ! " Then , curiously , the boxer betrayed a gutter hesitancy . He glanced querulously over his shoulder , as if asking : How long must I keep socking him , if he wo n't go down ? The instructor was charging him again , head down , fists working . This time Paddy stepped neatly aside , and smashed a swift left hook beneath the pumping forearms . It caught Sam below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stagger . Tottering , he felt a second blow ( it must have been a right hand thrown from behind the boxer 's ear ) catch him on the back of the neck . He was on his knees , watching the drip-drip-drip of blood from his ripped mouth onto the pavement , hearing McDevitt asking him plaintively : " For Christ 's sake , Abelman , enough is enough . This guy is a pro , Paddy Lynch . He fights at the Velodrome . Let me call a cop . " Then he heard Pomerantz , his voice straining for confidence . " Sam , call it off . So he beat you , so what ? The punk threw a rabbit punch . That 's illegal . " Still shaking his head , blinking , hearing the rabble 's happily horrified murmur , he knew he could not quit while he could still stand and raise his fists . There was always someone out to beat you , to make you eat dirt : the teacher back in kheytler on the East Side , the streetcar conductors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Comerford out of business . You had to fight them , and on their terms . He was on his feet again . His head ached in a hundred places , and he saw only through his left eye . But his limbs , his body , the gymnast 's huge muscles and tough bones were intact . " Is a rabbit punch really illegal , McDevitt ? " he asked , trying to sound genuinely curious . McDevitt grasped his upper arms . " Sure it is , Abelman , you know that . Come on , we 'll call it quits . Fight 's over . " He shoved the supervisor away . " I just wanted an official opinion , because I 'm going to be illegal also . "  | The crowd screamed , and the hoodlums danced and chanted as the instructor and the pugilist squared off again . The boxer bounced on sneakered feet ; there was not a mark on him , not a cut , not a bruise . Yet he did not seem completely happy with his assignment . The rudimentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this muscular Jew all day . Paddy danced around him tantalizingly . His left fist , the knuckles now reddened and tender from having battered the hard face and body so many times , struck a half-dozen times . He varied them with the whipping right , pushing it against the iron chest and feeling it bounce away when it struck the Jew-boy 's shoulders and forearms . He must have hit him fifteen successive times , but there had been no retreat . Instead the crazy instructor was closing in , burying his bloodied head on the boxer 's lean chest , forcing him to move backward . " Ya crazy sheeny , " the boxer gasped . " D ' I hafta kill ya ? " " No , " he heard the instructor grunt , " I 'm gon na murder you . I made my mind up . " For an instant , striking Sam again with the right hand and hearing the painful grunt , he believed it : he would fight this Jew bastard all day and then he , Paddy Lynch , the best prelim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He believed it even more a second later . As they struggled apart , disengaging arms and heads , the boxer dropped his left arm in one exhausted lapse . In the unguarded interval , Sam , with no professional grace and in the poorest of style , had clouted him on the ear with his right fist . He had brought his thick arm around in a great sweeping arc , gathering momentum , and by the time the square fist landed with a dull clack on the boxer 's skull , it carried enough force to bend him sideways . Paddy 's aggrieved ear turned a deep crimson , a pained flush that spread across the contorted face . Sam saw his advantage . He accepted a somewhat discouraged flick of the left hand , and again , as they parted , swung the right hand . It landed high on Paddy 's temple . This time the boxer swayed and looked at him dreamily , unbelieving . The fine blue eyes were crossed , and the jaw drooped . Sam charged , head down , feeling the mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to stop him ; the boxer collapsed like a rotting timber . He was sitting on his haunches , less stunned than humiliated , now turning slowly toward his horrified supporters outside the fence . Sam wiped a scarlet streak from his mouth across his ann . With excessive deliberation , he knelt , placing a knee in the small of Paddy 's back and nailing him to the blazing cement . He grasped  | the boxer 's floundering left arm and yanked it sharply backward and upward , stopping only when he heard Paddy 's desperate wail . " Now what 's my name ? " he asked . " Rosenberg , ya bastard . " " No , it 's not . I 'll pronounce it for you . Samuel Abelman . Can you say that ? " A remnant of gutter bravado forced him to resist . " Nab , ya name is Rosenberg . " Sam looked through the fence . The galoots were studying him with grave , subdued hatred . " You tell him what my name is , you punks , or I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He yanked the arm viciously ( it was an old trick of Hector O'Bannion 's ) and the boxer screamed . " Ya sheeny bastard , " the boxer 's brother shouted . " We 'll mobilize ya ! " This time he pulled the arm and twisted the wrist simultaneously . The violence of the gesture caused blood to spurt from his own mouth . It fell in a little line of red polka dots on Paddy 's white shirt . " Let him go , " he heard the thin youth saying . " Ya name is Samuel Abelman . " " Swell , " said Sam , " you 're a real smart feller . Now , you , what 's my name ? " " Samuel Abelman , " the boxer gasped . " Now lemme up . " He was whining . Sam leaped back . Paddy rose painfully , first on elbows and knees , then on one knee and then upright . He was holding the left side of his head , the tenderized temple and cheek where the two blows had landed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream of obscenity assailed Sam again . But the cursing was less hearty . There were a few halfhearted " Rosenbergs " and a tin can was hurled . McDevitt and Pomerantz were studying his smeared , swollen face with polite horror . " You did n't have to go through that , " McDevitt said . " I could have got him to lay off . They 're my kind , you know . That Lynch . I saw him knock out a middleweight last year . Why did you have to push it ? " He was wiping Sam 's face off with a towel . Sam smiled , feeling each ache and cut on his battered face intensify . " Why not ? Who said he could sneak in ? How about the basketball game now ? " The visiting team  --  they were neighborhood people and they had mixed feelings about the fight  --  were eying him with curious respect .  | The captain , a Celtic ogre with a shock of orange hair and freckles the size of nickels , walked up and grasped his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be honored to be your opponents . " The others were nodding their heads . Pomerantz tossed the basketball to him and they were warming up under the basket , listening to McDevitt 's gymnasium chatter . The crowd had really not cheered his victory , indeed he had felt a faint hostility when the tide of battle changed . But he never could have backed down . The world was full of galoots laying in wait to make it rough for you . Sometimes you hit back , and sometimes you won . The trouble with winning , he told himself , was that you realized how loathsome your adversaries were . He took Sol 's pass , cut under the basket , and banked the ball off the cast-iron fretwork of the backboard , lingering long enough to see it bounce through the hoop . A not unpleasant mist drifted in from the ocean . The night odors of seaweed and moribund shellfish surrounded them . The doctor and his wife were holding hands , an attitude which seemed to Thrasher more habitual than amatory , a closeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unspoken , unevident . He sat with arms crossed on the cold railing , listening to the muted thunder of the waves , studying the doctor 's large , creased face under the lamplight . " I suppose I 'm the world 's greatest authority on galoots , " Dr. Abelman said . " All my life I 've been running into them . Even today there 's something about galoots . They smell me out like I 'm a natural enemy . Dog and cat . " " You do n't help any yourself , " she said petulantly . " You go looking for a lot of fights yourself . Or at least you used to , when you were younger . " " I guess I hate galoots because they get away with so much . I can always remember them , standing on street corners , never working , talking loud , living big . I think they enjoy life a lot more than I do . What worries them ? Do they stay awake nights over a leukemia case ? Do they worry about taxes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Thrasher ? " " I 'm afraid my knowledge of galoots is n't as extensive as yours , doctor . " " I do n't mean just the street-corner galoots , " the doctor said thoughtfully . " They got them everywhere . There 's all kinds of galoots. "  | Thrasher laughed . " You mean a kind of spiritual galoot ? " The doctor clapped his hands together . " Very good description ! The world is full of those bastards . Just look at my next-door neighbors , the Baumgarts . " Mrs. Abelman stood up heavily . In the misty yellow light she looked older and more misshapen . She was long past the ministrations , the magic of the Sunday magazine girdle ads . She looked her age , no more or less , and Thrasher was suddenly disturbed . Where were all the old people who looked like old people ? You never really saw any old people in his business ; if you did they were so artfully preserved , molded , cosmeticized , and appareled that they gave the illusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing a fat , aged , wrinkled , or poorly dressed mother or father into the office and saying , " These are my parents " Where were they all hiding ? Was everyone slim and young and fashionably dressed ? " Sam , do n't start on the Baumgarts . You 'll ruin what 's left of my vacation , " she said . " I think we 'd better get back , Mr. Thrasher . It 's getting late and you wo n't have any sleep at all . " She was worrying about someone else 's impending minor disaster again , and Thrasher found it tended to worry him also . Descending the wooden ramp , she twice cautioned them against falling ( it was not at all steep ) and she scolded the doctor for not having worn a warmer jacket . At street level she complained that the lights were insufficient and , spying two teen-age youths returning from a night dip , wondered aloud how they avoided pneumonia . " You were saying about galoots , doctor , " Thrasher said , " that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The doctor halted as they stepped off a curb , in deference to his wife 's warning to be careful , the drivers never looked where they were going . " A galoot is a guy who thinks the world owes him a living , " the doctor said . " And if he does n't have it handed to him on a silver platter , he goes after it at someone else 's expense . " It was an admirable definition , Thrasher felt : it included all galoots , everywhere . At the boardinghouse , the doctor volunteered to drive Thrasher to the station . The Buick coughed and protested and lurched off . With what seemed to Thrasher excessive casualness he turned to his wife and announced : " Well , ketzeleh , we 're through with galoots . We 're getting out . " " I 've been hearing that for years , " she said . " You know we decided against it a long time ago . "  | " Oh no . You decided against it . You were against the X-ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just like you 're against a new house . But this time , I made the decision . We 're buying a new house . " " Now , Sam ! Did you buy that house without telling me ? " From her tone it was clear she knew he had not , nor would he ever without her permission . " Dannenfelser is giving me a break on that beauty on Republic Street . He knocked his down payment down two thousand bucks . I told him to hold it . I 'm buying it . You ca n't stop me . " She settled back peevishly . " You 'll stop yourself when you think it over . At your age . You 're almost seventy . What are you doing with a new mortgage , new obligations , a new neighborhood ? What are you , some kid who can tackle all these things ? " They were silent a few moments . Thrasher was deeply embarrassed . She spoke after a while , sounding wan and unhappy . " Do n't you dare buy that house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be saddled with a terrible responsibility . And with our luck you 'll get a lemon . How do you know it 's worth over twenty thousand dollars ? " " Skip it , skip it , " he said . " We 're boring Mr. Thrasher . " The Buick rattled up to the Long Beach station , shivering as a dreadnought-sized Cadillac convertible , a chartreuse ark conveying two stout men in yachting caps and eight-inch cigars , brushed by and cut them off . i " Louse ! " the doctor snarled . " Galoots can drive Cadillacs , too ! " Thrasher wrestled with the broken door handle . The doctor had to lean over the seat and pound it with the right fist that had downed Paddy Lynch . It swayed from the car body . " You 'd do better buying a new car than wasting your money on a house , " Mrs. Abelman said . Thrasher leaned through the window . " Many thanks for your help , doctor . Can I see you this weekend ? " " Yeah , sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seemed preoccupied , inattentive . Clearly , the argument over the new house had unsettled him . Thrasher felt an urgent need to leave him in a more cheerful frame of mind . " I thoroughly enjoyed your stories about Mr. Comerford and Hector O'Bannion and Pomerantz . By the way , what ever happened to Pomerantz ? " The doctor blinked behind his thick lenses . " Solly ? He had that corner drugstore for years . The tunkeles held him up four times .  | The fourth time he got disgusted and tried to throw them out . He died in St. Mary 's Hospital with three bullets in his chest . " " I 'm sorry to hear about it . " The doctor sighed , crossing his thick forearms on the wheel . " Yeah , they 're all gone . " He shook his head mechanically . " I do n't know what it is . There was a kind of gentleness in people then , something I miss more and more every year of my life . Mr. Comerford , what a gent ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Bannion ? " " Whatever happened to O'Bannion ? He was quite a guy ! " Thrasher was trying to be , as his associates would say , upbeat . " He lost Chelsea College . The bank got it . He went broke and died young . Lots of people thought he was a charlatan , and maybe he was in a little way . But he never hurt anyone , and he gave so many free scholarships to his school he never made a nickel . Lots of people were peddling physical culture then , stuff they stole from O'Bannion  --  including some doctors . But he never got a red cent out of it . " The train had arrived . The seashore crowd surged toward the gate : a bloated blonde in red knickers pushing an overfed dark boy ; a herd of bony teen-agers , raucous and contemptuous ; two swart Sicilians , garlanded with black curls and sideburns , shepherding a pair of bosomy young girls in peasant blouses . " Everyone pushes and shoves , " the doctor said sadly , " everybody is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody does anything for its own sake any more . That was the trouble with Comerford and O'Bannion , both of them . They could n't get anywhere with what they liked to do . Comerford read his books when he should have been taking ads , and O'Bannion gave free tuition instead of rounding up students . They were gentle , that was their trouble . " Thrasher shook hands with the doctor . " I 'd like to convince you that the world as it is today is n't so bad after all , doctor . Maybe we can argue it next time . There 's plenty of kindness around , if you look for it . " The doctor shrugged . " Ah , I 've been talking too much . I 'm not as unhappy as I sound . " " Gloomy Gus , that 's you , " Mrs. Abelman said . " You talked so much you 'll get a sore throat . Mr. Thrasher , you 'll miss your train if you do n't hurry . " She had pointed out two more impending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulk of the doctor 's office work was crammed together on weekends . Sometimes the waiting room would be filled from midmorning through late afternoon and Jannine would have to set up bridge chairs to accommodate the overflow . If the weather was pleasant , several patients would adorn the doctor 's front stoop , taking advantage of the sunlight filtering through the bright foliage of the Lombardy poplar . He loved the ritual of the office : opening the double doors to the examining room , inviting the next patient in ; the case histories , the preliminary interrogation , the probings . With old hands , he liked to discuss family matters , business affairs ; they knew he expected it and they told him everything . With new patients , he delighted in learning the new facts , even though , more often than not , they were a dreary repetition of a hundred similar cases . It had been a tiring day . A GI series on the Traficanti boy had kept him in and out of the darkroom most of the morning . He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gnaw at him all through the day . That was the trouble with medicine  --  nothing was ever isolated . Every case , every patient was a part of you all the time . Angelo Traficanti 's duodenum would occupy him continually , infringing on his concern over Mrs. Abarbanel 's arthritis , Shirley Feinman 's fainting spells , Mr. McMorris ' coronary , and Ed Dineen 's gall bladder . All of them would force themselves like driven nails into his consciousness , until his mind was a swarm of problems , self-generating and self-propagating , feeding on each other and on him and shutting out his personal worries . He did not think about the new house very much on weekends . At five in the afternoon there were still several people in the waiting room , sitting quietly in the dull heat , all of them flecked with the irregular spangles of the tree-patterned sunlight . He had just given Rabbi Piltz his monthly check-up , and the snuffish odor of the old man lingered in the examining room . The patriarch departed , waving his authoritative cane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened doors , the doctor chuckled , addressing the three people in the hot anteroom . " Well , we 're all in good luck today . The rabbi blessed us . " He  | did not notice that two of the people were Negroes , nor did it bother him . In the filth and noise of the savage street he saw an enemy in each dark face ; in the office they became real people , identifiable , capable of salvation , worthy of a little dignity . A stout Negro woman , draped in the outlandish dark clothes which denoted Deep South churchgoing and an eschewal of vulgarity , rose hesitantly . Gently , she guided a thin , cafe-au-lait youth toward the door . He moved lightly , head down , his manner one of contemptuous indifference . At the door , the third patient , a short fat man in a soiled white shirt leaped from his seat . Boldly , he thrust himself between the doctor and the Negroes , crying coarsely : " It 's my next ! " " It 's your next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's your neck , and it could use a bath . These people were first . " The fat man looked from the doctor to the Negroes . He said nothing , but the curled upper lip and the eyes transmitted the message : They are black and I am white and therefore it does n't matter if they were here first . " So you do n't take me foist ? " he asked . " If you were first , I 'd take you first , " the doctor said . " You know ? the last shall be first . Ever read the Bible , Ballenberg ? " That was the trouble with most of the doctor 's little ripostes : they pointed morals and they were much too far above the heads of his audience . Ballenberg ignored him . " You 'll take dem foist ? " he persisted . " Of course , " said the doctor . With a deft shove he moved the fat man aside and , opening the doors wider , ushered in the Negro woman and the boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ballenberg said . " I 'll fix you , Abelman ! I 'll go by Baumgart ! He would n't take a schwartzer foist ! To your own people you do this , hah ? " He turned , irate and indignant , slum honor sullied by the doctor 's insistence on fair play . The Negro woman looked distraught . " Ah 'm sorry , doctor , " she said in a barely audible voice . " Maybe you shudda seen him first . You gon ' lose a patient . " " Who needs him . Who needs his kind ? " And he knew , of course , that he needed all of them , the galoots , the boors , the villains . Yet somehow Dr. Baumgart never seemed to have these troubles with patients ; you never heard him arguing with them , moralizing , ordering them out of his office . And how that young guy knew how to collect the big fees ! They paid through the nose for his X-ray work , they called him in on consultations , and he sucked them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room  --  a  | mingled essence of summer flowers drifted into the dim room . Through the cracks between shade and window , slivers of late afternoon sun intruded , falling across the comforting face of Harlow Brooks . He sat the youth to one side of the great desk and the woman perched unhappily at the tip of the deformed Morris chair . " I think I know you , " the doctor said . He squinted over his glasses at the woman . " Are you related to the Jeffersons on Patchen Avenue ? " " No , suh , " she answered faintly . " Well , I 'm sure I know you , " the doctor said , looking at the boy . The youth silently lowered his head , an exquisite knob , molded and shaped like a bronze museum piece . The black burrs on top were an afterthought , a Greenwich village touch on an authentic Ashanti wood carving . " Ah don ' know you , " the boy muttered . " Well , it 's a funny thing , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a patient , but I could swear I 've met you . " The youth jerked his head , the kind of movement a dog makes when being annoyed by flies . " You don ' know me . Don ' nobody know me , " he said flatly . Then , inexplicably , he looked up quickly and , with an impertinent grin , said , " Ah deh man of mystery . " The doctor settled back in the swivel chair , crossing his stubby legs . He enjoyed the challenge of the perverse patient , and the youth 's mocking tone had not been wasted on him . " That 's very nice . We should get along fine , because , you see , I 'm very good at solving mysteries . If you 're a mystery , I 'll find it out , young fellah . I 'm a kind of detective . But you would n't know anything about detectives or cops , would you ? " The boy started to rise , the stringy body uncoiling like a snaked " Ah don ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he told his mother . " You make me come here . Ain ' nothin ' wrong with me . " She raised her voice and leaned forward , speaking in the hard voice of the deaconess , the church pillar . " You sit down dere , Herman , and be polite to deh doctor . You a sick boy . " The doctor turned to his desk , yanked out a fresh file card , and dipped the non-fillable pen in the clotted inkwell . " You can stay or get the hell out , young man , " he said sharply . " Excusing your presence , lady , I do n't need him . " " He gon ' stay , " she said . It seemed to settle the issue for the time being . The doctor began his interrogation , writing swiftly and illegibly , salting his notes with the shorthand symbols he still remembered from his days as a male stenographer for Mr. Comerford and Hector  | O'Bannion . He learned quickly that the boy 's name was Herman Quincy , age seventeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived with his mother ( father deceased ) in a fourth-story walkup . He had no past history of serious disease , and from the doctor 's cursory study of him appeared to be in good health , if somewhat sullen and ill-mannered . " So what 's bothering him ? " the doctor asked Mrs. Quincy . She shifted her dark bulk , layered with ungainly petticoats and skirts . " He havin ' fits , " she said . " Ah , hell , Ah ain ' had nothing but a little faintin ' , " Herman said , turning his head away again . The doctor leaned forward . " What kind of fits ? " he asked . " Jes ' fits is all , " she said uncomfortably . " He done had three already . He had one las ' week runnin ' ' round with his no-good friends . An ' he had two more at home . Ah ' seen deh last one . " " Have you been to any other doctor ? " " No , suh . He do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word epilepsy to you ? To you , Herman ? " They both shook their heads , uncomprehending . " What was this fit , as you call it , like ? Did you pass out right away , Herman ? Do you remember anything ? " " Ah don ' remember nothin ' . Ah ain ' sick . " " This last fit , the one you saw , Mrs. Quincy , what happened ? " " It skeer me awful , doctor . He come home late at night an ' I hear him moanin ' and thrashin ' . He layin ' on deh bed an ' his fingers an arm , dey jerkin ' and twitchin ' ? " " Left or right arm ? " " Ah don ' recall . " " Well , was it both arms and sets of fingers , or one ? " She ruminated , recalling the tan body writhing on the rumpled bedsheets under the glaring bulb . " Ah ain ' sure , doctor , but Ah thinks at first only one arm and deh fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ den deh whole body , twitchin ' and jumpin ' . " " What do you remember , Herman ? " " Nothin ' . Ah fainted das all . " Dr. Abelman scowled . " You may be pretty sick , young man . You should realize I 'm trying to help you . " " Ah don ' need no help . " " What else , Mrs. Quincy ? How long did this seizure last ? " " Ah ain ' sure , seem lak a whole hour , but could'n ' been more den five , ten minutes . " " What happened then ? "  | " He pass out cold a few minutes , " she said . " He right , he fainted , but dat come after deh fit . Den he wake up and he say his right arm weak , he cai n't move it . How long dat last , Herman ? " " Couple minutes . My arm fall asleep das all . " The doctor looked owlishly at him through thick glasses . His eyebrows bristled over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that right arm now , Herman ? Think it 's strong enough to hand wrestle me on the desk ? " " Dat arm feel fine . Ah cud pitch a double-header . " He was looking up , smiling easily , without the contempt he had evinced earlier . " Okay big shot , put the arm down here and see who goes down first . " He moved aside his blood pressure apparatus and daybook , grasping the thin brown fist . Their elbows rested on the glass top . Herman looked apprehensively at the huge biceps under the shortsleeved shirt and widened his eyes a fraction . " You pretty strong for a ole man , " he said . " Strong enough to knock some sense into you , " the doctor said . " Ready ? " Herman nodded . They clamped hands , and , after a second of resistance , the doctor slammed the tan arm to the desk top . " How does it feel now , Herman ? " " Feel funny . Mebbe a little weak . " He was examining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Josh the Dill , could be afflicted with any kind of weakness . The doctor invited him into the examining room , asking Mrs. Quincy to remain behind . You did better with them when you had them alone . Relatives got in the way , particularly when there was palpable hostility between family members . Herman stripped down to his shorts in the interior room . The doctor took his height , his weight , his blood pressure ; listened routinely to his chest and heart and found nothing out of the ordinary . He seemed a perfectly healthy child of the gutter : limbs , heart , and lungs defiantly strong . Like so many of his companions , the absence of vitamins , pediatricians , and wheat germ had not affected Herman Quincy 's physical well-being . The doctor was examining his ears , nose , and throat , probing with spatula , the patient seated on a converted piano stool below him , when he noticed the pinpricks in the soft flesh of the tan thigh . " And what are those , mosquito bites ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hostility returning . " Das my business . " " How much do you take ? "  | " What Ah can git . " " Can you do without it ? Or are you hooked for good ? " He lowered the sculptured head , turning away from the doctor 's outraged face , a face which said : No goddam patient of mine has the right to be addicted . " Ah take it or leave it . Ah too smart to be hooked . " " You taking it now ? " " Ai n't had it fo ' a few days . " The doctor wondered idly if the strange convulsions , the loss of consciousness , the weakness in the right arm could be the result of narcotic addiction  --  or perhaps abstinence from it . He would have to consult the texts ; crazy things happened to addicts , one-ina-thousand symptoms which had to be taken into account before you even leaned toward other diagnoses . He 'd have to probe the boy 's medical , history . They must have taken him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a medical record available . You could n't leave anything to guesswork ; you researched it as deeply as you could . He flicked off the overhead chandelier and lit his ophthalmoscope . Preceded by the yellow cone of light , he walked toward Herman again . " Herman , you get headaches , do n't you ? " " How you know ? " " I just guessed . What kind of headaches ? Morning , when you wake up ? " He was bending over him now , peering through the instrument into the luminous eyeball . " Yeh . Dey come an ' go quick in deh morning . Jes ' a few minutes , das all . " " Every morning ? " " Three out of fo ' mebbe . Sometime dey come quick when I go to deli bathroom , or bend over fast . " The doctor squinted into the eyeball , trying to focus his own tired eye on the optic disc . On the side of the disc nearest the nose , there was a faint blurring of the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swollen  --  papilledema , the books called it . And papilledema could mean several things : hypertension , kidney disease , something worse ... . That was the challenge of the profession : the more you knew , the more possibilities you opened up . He was starting with papilledema , a swelling or choking of the optic disc ; a slight engorgement of the veins , the blurring and dim streaking that might conceivably have been the start of a hemorrhage . Where would it lead him ?  | Turning on the overhead light again , he sat Herman on the creaking examining table . He had worn out a dozen leather examining pads on its smooth hard surface : the bright green plastic affair resting there now was his daughter 's gift . It did n't ring true next to the smoky wooden sides and legs . " Just lay still , Herman , completely relaxed . " " Ah relax real good . Man , Ah 'm loose . " " Loose as a goose , is that what you fellows say ? " He chattered on aimlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid the slightest tensing or resistance to his probing fingers . The doctor began with Herman 's face , poking at the forehead , the delicate musculature of the eyelids , the muscles around the thick African lips , light pink inside the darker red . He found nothing suspect . Gripping the right arm at the elbow , he tried rotating it , seeking some rigidity , some resistance to the passive motion . There was n't any  --  the arm moved freely . The hands and fingers offered no stiffness either , nor did the left arm . Next he tested the extensors of the knees and the plantar flexors of the feet ; there was neither resistance nor an exaggeration of the normal reflexes . The whole picture of the limbs was negative . Or had he missed something ? Again , the worm of doubt gnawed at him . You could miss the slightest hint , the faintest suggestion of a symptom and go completely wrong the rest of the way . To assure himself he repeated all the tests , flexing and probing the bronze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Now go to the end of the room by the door and walk toward me at your normal pace , no faster or slower . " The boy rolled off the table lightly , stood at the locked double doors , his figure sharp as a paper cutout against the bottle-green shades . " Walk toward me , son , " the doctor said . Herman walked . The doctor looked intently at his arms and legs , studying particularly the right-hand members , seeking some variance from the normal gait , some faint betrayal of what he suspected . The boy moved as lithely and easily as an oiled machine . There was even a faint swagger to his narrow hips and small athletic buttocks . Did he imagine that the right arm was swinging differently ? Was the right knee the slightest bit stiffer than the left ? " Now walk away from me , a little slower , " he said . Herman spun about and proceeded again , toward the shaded doors . The doctor took off his glasses and studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his imagination : you sometimes started to see signs because you wanted them to be there , to tie together  | the loose ends of a diagnosis . He told himself that the boy 's right knee was indeed stiff , that the right arm was not swinging normally . But comparing them again to their opposite members he decided the difference existed in his mind , in his eagerness to confirm his suspicions . Herman , his tour of the office completed , stood in front of the physician gazing down at him with bored , detached eyes . The doctor leaned back in the swivel chair and pushed his eyeglasses back on to his forehead . " Herman , I want you to repeat a sentence after me . You listen-ing ? " " Sho . " " " Fine . Say this : Around the rugged rock the ragged rascal ran . " " Whuh ? " " Say it just the way I did . Go ahead . " " Ah don ' recolleck it . Whuffo yo ' wan ' me say dat ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to get you a job as President of the United States , Herman , and you have to speak very nicely in that job . Now you understand ? Come on , repeat it : Around the rugged rock the ragged rascal ran . " Herman Quincy did not smile at the old man 's joke at his expense ; but , reluctantly , he repeated the strange sentence , slurring words and syllables together with deliberate contempt . " Roan ' de ruggah rock de raggah rascahran . " " Wise guy , hey , Herman ? " the doctor said . Again he was in furious debate with himself : did the tongue-twister come out any more blurred or indistinct than Herman 's normally slothful speech ? Was there a hint that the faculty of speech had been impaired ? He pointed to Herman 's clothes . " Okay , Herman , you 've been very co-operative . Get dressed . " Throughout the examination Mrs. Quincy had remained seated precariously on the edge of the Morris chair in the consultation room . She looked as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat on the graying steel-wool hair added to the illusion of unbalance . " Well , Mrs. Quincy , " Dr. Abelman began , " there 's something wrong with Herman , but I 'm not sure what it is . I need your help and his . I want you to keep a record of his headaches and his fits . " She looked at him blankly , uncomprehending . " Look . Get a piece of paper with lines and write down whenever Herman gets a convulsion . Here , I 'll give you some . " He fumbled in the lower desk drawer , in a pile of old rolled-up  | EKGS , electric bill stubs , and irregular stack of prescriptions , envelopes , and stationary , and found a ruled pad that Myron had brought from the newspaper office . " Now listen to me , and you too , Herman . I want you to write down on this paper every time you get a headache . The date , and how long it lasted . Also if you became nauseated and had to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit you have . How long it lasted , exactly what happened . You , Mrs. Quincy , you watch him closely and tell your neighbors , if they 're around , to watch him too . Now this is very important : call me when he has the next fit . I do n't care how late it is , call me . If I 'm in Long Beach , I ca n't come back , because it would be over by then . But if I 'm in my office , or if I can be reached nearby , I want to see the next , one ? " " Dey ain ' gon ' be no next one . Ah 'm okay . " " Like hell you are . You 're sick . I do n't know how sick , but I 'm going to find out . " He advised them that a series of X-rays would be needed . He himself would do the routine work in his office ; if more specialized pictures were needed ( and already he suspected they would be ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protested  --  they were very poor , would n't the clinic be better ? " No . If you 're my patients you have to trust me . Do n't worry about the cost . I 'll see that you can afford it . What do you think , I 'm a professor and charge Park Avenue prices ? " He took two dollars from her for the office visit . The two dollars already represented an hour 's hard work and hard thinking ; stuffing the rumpled bills in his trouser pocket , he knew the sixty minutes would generate an evening 's worry , a few afternoons in the medical library , any number of phone conversations with the doctors he trusted . The waiting room was vacant . He bid them goodbye and , motivated by a curiosity he could not explain , peered from the screened window as they descended the stoop . On the street , the youth pulled a ridiculous checked cap over his eyes and skipped lightly away from his unwieldy mother . The doctor watched him prance away down the cluttered , steaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son-o f - a- bitch . It did n't have to be the same one , the one who rang his bell and called him names . They all looked alike in the dark . Besides , that cop , Kaplan , had told him his name was something else , Jess , or Joss , or something like that . He could n't keep unimportant information in his mind any longer ; there were too many symptoms and lab tests and techniques and diagnoses and prognoses and therapies to remember . Who could remember the  | name of a tunkele galoot ? And suppose it was ? Should he run him in  --  call the cops ? To hell with all of them , he thought . Let the cops find him . He plodded through the liquiform heat of the office into the backyard . Under the cherry tree , Diane licking at his hands , he rested on the rotting slatted bench and reviewed the symptoms : three peculiar convulsions , apparently affecting the right side ( if the colored woman 's description could be believed ) , a history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the optic disk ( or something akin to that ) , and maybe an abnormal gait on the right side of the body . All he could be really sure of was the convulsion and the headache and he had n't witnessed them . And there was the narcotic usage to be taken into account . Could headache and convulsions be associated with a bad reaction to heroin  --  or whatever it was that young punk was shooting into his system ? He rose from the sagging seat and walked with short , stiff steps into his cornfield . A breeze fluttered the tassels and he inhaled deeply . He did not cultivate his corn through any mystique ; he did it to be witness to the process of germination and growth , to participate in the battle against worms and smut , to fertilize the tired earth , to cull the stones , to water the roots , and to pick the fat ears . He liked eating them , too . Like Thoreau , he only wanted the earth to say corn instead of weeds . Half aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? Why do they come to me all the time ? " The pointless protest answered itself . Office hours were ended , but he would be a long time worrying about Herman Quincy 's seizures . Ile allowed himself just a few more minutes in the cornfield , picking two ripe ears for his dinner as he left . There had been an article on intracranial tumors in an AMA Journal a few months back . Recalling it , he was impelled to read it at once . Thrasher reached his home after one in the morning . The combined trip on not one but two commuter lines , from Long Beach to Pennsylvania Station , then from Grand Central to the shores of Connecticut , left him exhausted . The sight of his bedroom window alight , beckoning to him in the country night as he approached his house in a speeding cab ( they always made more noise than necessary at night , he was convinced ) , started the ebb of fatigue from his body . It delighted him so much , it did not occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting up in bed , her long rectangle of a face with its flawless planes looking distressingly attractive .  | " What 's the big deal , O'Neill ? " he asked . " Something hot on the late , late show ? " They kissed and he ran his hands over her teen-ager 's limbs , strong and fuzzed with gold . " Seriously , Ann , baby , since when are you an insomniac ? We 're not the sleeping pill kind of young moderns . We sleep good because we 're creative , remember ? " " Woody , you wo n't believe it , " she said , half tearfully , " but it was that damn redwood table . I worked and slaved over it all afternoon . I said I 'd be damned if I 'd send it back to the Outdoor Livin ' Shop and have them send me another set that I could n't assemble . " " So ? Sounds like you did the right thing . " " Oh , Christ , I worked all day on it ! Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender ; as she turned her hands over he could see the painful white calluses on her palms . " I figured out that the braces had to be shortened  --  that they were n't a precise fit . So I sawed them down , bolted them in , and ? " " For goodness ' sake , baby , what the hell is so disastrous about fixing a redwood table ? " She wailed , " I sawed them too short ! The whole damn table shakes like lime jello ! It 's no good ! And I 'm no good ! " He put on his dacron shortie pajamas . " Baby , baby , what kind of carrying on is that ? So we 'll sue the Outdoor Livin ' Shop . We 'll get a refund . " Solicitously , he wiped her eyes with a tissue . " I do n't know , " she said , " it 's just that I hate to be defeated by a real job , by having to do something myself , with my own damn hands . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why should n't I be able to assemble a redwood table ? " He plopped into his bed , turning off the lamp between them . She was using the inadequacy approach , he was sure , and he was aware that the guilt lay with him . Ann had deep suspicions ( maybe she knew for a fact by now ) that he was unfaithful on a fairly regular basis . The whole routine , he felt , was aimed at arousing his sympathy . But , on reflection , he altered his analysis . She had always been terribly concerned with her failures , no matter how small . After an enthusiastic start , she had given up golf because she could n't improve her putting quickly enough . And the business about doing things  --  hell , Ann was n't alone . All over Connecticut and Westchester there were wives making little things out of tile and clay , diddling around with ceramics , potsherds , leaf imprints , and filigree work . If not that , they joined organizations to lower , raise , or stabilize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't console her . He would have been even worse where the redwood  | table was concerned ; he would either have left it to rot and warp unassembled in the garage , or would have paid his gardener five dollars to put it together , thereby negating the savings she had engineered by taking advantage of Outdoor Livin 's end-of-season clearance . He would have lost either way without even a try . " Well , nuts to the redwood table , Ann , " he said comfortingly . " My good friend Dr. Abelman could have shown us how it worked . And if it did n't he would have spit in Outdoor Livin 's flagstone eye . " " You sound like he has the answer to everything . Really , Woody , if I did n't know you better , I 'd suspect you two of being simpatico . " " I could do worse . " He slammed the pillow . " Ben Loomer called twice tonight , " she said . " He was trying like mad to locate you . He seemed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reached . " He jerked up in bed , betraying his concern . " What did Ben have to say ? " " He 'd like you in an hour earlier tomorrow . You 're all scheduled to meet Mr. Gatling for a progress report on Americans , U.S.A. " Progress report : that was a good Ben Loomer phrase . He liked to deal in progress reports , evaluations , tables of organizations , and co-ordinated plans of attack . Normally a progress report was not too much to worry about ; you went in armed with a few convincing catch phrases ; you were terribly enthusiastic ; you stressed the originality and attention-getting qualities of your program ; and you assured everyone that it could sell . But why the meeting at Gatling 's diggings ? Normally the G dr T people kept themselves far removed from the actual programming of their radio and television properties  --  the notable exception had been Brick Higgins , and Thrasher was convinced they had been burned badly in their insistence on using the fat slob . He was sure of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session , and if there were second thoughts on the part of the sponsor regarding Americans , U.S.A. , his own associates at Whitechapel had implanted them . Getting to the office an hour earlier meant missing his usual express to Grand Central . He stood as far as 125th Street , and only got as far as the theater section of the Times . Not having read the book review left him with an incomplete feeling . Loomer was all good cheer and straight talk . Finucane looked bloated and discolored ; the alcoholic pouches under his eyes seemed to have a detachable , do-it-yourself quality . They sipped their morning coffee and Loomer explained , as considerately as possible , that Mr. Gatling wanted to know more about Americans , U.S.A. After all , it represented a big investment to them . Their radio ,  | magazine , and newspaper campaigns were all set ; they had some exciting new products they were introducing . Only their television showcase was lagging . Mr. Gatling wanted to know all about it , something about the first subject , the commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chilson to come along to this marshmallow roast , " Loomer said casually . " The kid is going to function as assistant to the producer , Woody . That means he 's your baby . " " I already got a baby , " Thrasher protested . Loomer and Finucane looked blankly at him . They probably knew by now  --  there were no secrets in their incestuous business ? of his carryings-on with Alice Taggart . They were men of excessive morality , and while a little cheating was permissible , you did n't go around making public jokes about it . Thrasher waited for them to speak , and then , understanding their silent shock , he laughed . " Oh  --  not that kind of baby ! I meant I already hired an assistant to the producer . A kid named Myron Malkin . He 's the doctor 's nephew , a newspaperman on the Record . He can be very helpful on local color , anecdotes , etcetera . " Loomer turned a shade redder , a kind of patio terra-cotta . " As executive producer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Who says you 're executive producer ? " Thrasher asked . " There was a company memo put out on it late yesterday . If you had n't run off to Far Rockaway ? " " Long Beach ? " " ? for another of these crazy seances , you 'd have known . Now it seems to me it 's my prerogative to okay everyone assigned . If you insist on Dexter Daw , okay , I know he 's talented . But this nephew character ? " Thrasher was a lot less stunned than he should have been . After the Variety article it was inevitable that Loomer and Finucane would follow up their attempt to grab the credit for the new program by creating jobs for themselves . They were playing the title game again . Everybody needed an identity , a label , just like a line of drug products . They tossed titles and positions around like an old vaudeville juggler manipulating oranges . Executive producer , producer , associate producer , assistant producer , assistant to the producer , supervisor , supervisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manager , managing editor , project officer , coordinator , unit manager , business manager  --  there was no end to it . They dealt in symbols and slogans so much , Thrasher thought , that the designations lost their meaning after a while . Functions became blurred , indistinct , the higher you went . What did the executive  | producer do that the producer did n't do ? Where draw the line between a supervisor and an associate producer ? He knew of one program where the associate producer 's job was to buy live chickens every morning in the produce market . The comedian who starred on the program gave six free chickens away to lucky housewives every afternoon ; the associate producer had to keep them fed , watered , and caged , and clean up after them . Thrasher was envious of him : now there was an associate producer who knew exactly what he was supposed to do and did it . No vagueness of job , no overlapping with the executive producers and the supervisors . " I 'll make a deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't raise any fuss about Chilson , or about you , for that matter , if you 'll let me keep this Malkin kid . We can make both of them assistants to the producer . " " If you insist , Woody . Hell , you know I 'm a reasonable guy . And I wish you 'd stop feeling that I 'm working against you . Tom and I need you , boy . Right , Tommy ? " Finucane gargled , locating what remained of his voice . " You bet your ass we do ! We were tellin ' Gatling only yesterday what a solid citizen you are  --  how the whole thing was your idea ? " He stopped too quickly , and Loomer looked downward . Of course they had been huddling with the client , and , of course , any misgivings the client had must have originated with them . " Now that 's funny , " Thrasher said . " All through the Brick Higgins fiasco , Gatling never once met with us . He 'd send word through his hunkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a three-line memo . Why is he suddenly taking such a personal interest ? " Loomer pulled his square body out from behind his desk . " Skip it , Woody , you 've made your mind up to be unreasonable . Let 's go . " Ted Chilson was waiting for them outside the door . The lapels of his blue cotton cord , almost invisible , were imperfectly ironed ; the roll of his Brooksweave shirt was properly unkempt , and his dark-red foulard was knotted carelessly . Thrasher was annoyed with himself for studying the young man so . closely ; annoyed even more with the minute perfect symbols of his complete self-assurance , his complete membership . Lyman Gatling 's office was enormous , severe , and functional except for little illumined shrines which glowed from glassed-in recesses in the battleship-gray wall . In each of the glass compartments , couchant on maroon velvet , was one of G dr T 's numerous products . A color engineer who commanded a five-figure consulta-  | tion fee had been called in to select the proper interior lighting ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interior decorator . In one shrine lay a blue-and-gold plastic Whiffo dispenser ; in another the familiar rectangular box of Blanch ; in another the stern , dark bottle of Vita-life . " I hate the lousy things , " Gatling told Thrasher when he noticed the agency man studying them . " Some pansy decorator sold Van Alst on them , and before I could say no they were having consultations . " He was a man in his sixties , everything about him stout , pendulous , and hairless . His round , bald head hung low over a flabby chest , and each feature of his white face drooped and sagged ? the mournful blue eyes , the waxy nose with its tulip-bulb tip , the lower lip falling in a fat pink fold over the cushioned chin . Yet there was nothing flabby about Lyman Gatling 's movements , his voice , or his mind . The firm had originally been founded by Parker Theis 's parents . Gatling had started as an apprentice chemist under old man Theis , and when the latter had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parker did not have his father 's talents for manufacturing , marketing , and administration . Gatling had never consciously sought the high post he was eventually to get : it had come to him through natural evolution . He was competent and shrewd and possessed an unerring instinct for hiring capable people . Thrasher , looking at the great soft heap , an amorphous blob of white paraffin , wondered how many competitors had been deceived by Lyman Gatling 's appearance . The agency man felt a secret little pleasure at meeting someone who , so ugly , misshapen , and asymmetrical , could rise so high and command such vast amounts of money and respect . " Come to think of it , " Gatling said , in his loud clear voice  --  he had spent many years making himself heard over the din of half a dozen steaming factories ? " some of you birds had a hand in those things . Ai n't that right , Van Alst ? " D. M. Van Alst , vice-president in charge of sales and advertising , seated at Gatling 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut and a face that succeeded in being roseate and bloodless at the same time . He held a gold automatic pencil in readiness over a memo pad . Gatling looked indifferently at the four visitors , the alien salesmen , the dealers in words , whom he and his companions of the shop looked to for counsel . " I seem to recall there was a guy like one of you  --  some thin kid in a narrow suit . He kept talking about  | making my office a microcosm of the whole . I kept thinking he was saying hole and I told him I did n't particularly like our line of laxatives and did n't want their memory perpetuated in my office . " The little speech had unsettled all of them but Thrasher . He was smiling , feeling a growing affection for Lyman Gatling . What their previous encounter with the drug titan had been like , Thrasher could not guess ; but it seemed a good bet he had saved a lot of himself for further meetings . He was that kind of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him at a time . In reserve were great hoards of strength , wit , and intelligence . " Mr. Gatling , " Loomer began , bending forward and clasping his square hands into a huge red block , " when Tom and I spoke to you , we tried to give you a brief outline of our new show . Now , Woody Thrasher here is producing and writing the project and , frankly , he 's been a sort of one-man task force to date . So we asked him up here to answer any questions you might have . " Gatling tugged at the pendulous lower lip until it seemed to drop below his chin . " Hell , I did n't send for him , " Gatling said . " You birds came to me . I do n't like being dragged into these artistic fights . I 'm a chemist . I let Van Alst 's bright boys in advertising worry about the programs , and I trust old Whitechapel because I know he 's never gone out of his way to cheat anyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Finucane spluttered , " you said yourself you wanted to know more about Americans , U.S.A. You said yourself right here , last time . " " Did I ? " " I might have misunderstood you , too , " Loomer said . " Oh , hell , " the drugmaker said , wobbling the fleshy gourd of a head from side to side , " maybe I did want to know a little more . But one of you birds could have sent me a one-page memo . Would have been as good as a meeting . " It was magnificent , Thrasher thought . The old sloven had probably listened sympathetically to their recital of misgivings about the new TV property on which he was about to spend a million dollars . Gatling did n't know a good show from a bad show , but he could smell a conspiracy a factory block away . Gauging the true purpose of their original audience , he was playing it safe . They were all strangers to him , smart young men who talked well and used graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad show ( and after Parker Theis 's insistence on Brick Higgins he was exceedingly wary of television ) , he would prefer to find out for himself  --  not have two birds in narrow suits tell him . Loomer was smiling . " Fair enough , Mr. Gatling , let 's call it a  | misunderstanding . Now suppose I let Woody take it from here . Go ahead , Woody , it 's dealer 's choice and you 've got the deck . " " Suppose you tell me , Mr. Gatling , " Thrasher began innocently . " What 's your impression of the show ? " The drug manufacturer looked surprised . In his dealings with advertising men , public relations experts , publicists , and press agents , he was rarely asked anything . They usually were making presentations , throwing posters under his nose , reading from leatherbound folders . " All I know is it 's a half hour of expensive network time . " " You know more than that , Mr. Gatling , " Thrasher said softly , pleased with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galling spun about , showing a profile that was less a face than a series of pasty lumps . One sad eye stayed with Thrasher . " What did you say your name was ? " he asked . " Woodrow Thrasher , and what 's the difference ? You no more care what my name is than you would if I were a hundredweight of potassium permanganate . You 've seen plenty of smart kids like me , Mr. Gatling , and I 'm sure you 've looked at enough incoming shipments of potassium permanganate . " What might have been a smile sought unsuccessfully to invert the downward droop of the executive 's lips . " I know what your buddies told me , and I got a report from Van Alst here . He read some of that stuff from that little grass-covered booklet with the faces on the cover . " " How much do you remember ? " " Something about real people doing real things . It sounded kind of dull , if you ask me . But hell , I 'm a chemist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , we stay with this one character  --  for a half hour and get his life story . You think this can sell Whiffo ? " " It depends on how it 's done , " Thrasher said quickly . " And I assure you , Mr. Gatling , Whitechapel plans to do this right . That 's why we 're insisting on Andrew Bain Lord , " Loonier said firmly . " Always liked Andy Lord , " Gatling said . " The wife and I would n't miss him . That man is a goddam genius , pure and simple . " Thrasher shivered at the thought of Andrew Bain Lord , the great Potemkin Village of American Journalism , a brainless wretch with a handsome hewn-rock face , a white crew cut , and the holy tones of a Baptist circuit rider . Every evening Lord assaulted the radio with what was advertised as a newscast , a bathetic conglomeration of neutral information , written by a ghost in a cozy conversational  | style , and delivered with the histrionic skill of a summer stock heavy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the industry , so much so that his ghost writer , a stunted drunkard who had once edited the Discoverist Review , was an equally appreciated character in network circles . And yet a shrewd and capable man like Lyman Gatling could listen to Andrew Bain Lord 's mellifluous nonsense and acclaim him a genius : it was the miracle of the word again . " I 'll take your word , gents , that this is a good idea , " Gatling resumed , " and I 'm sold on Andy Lord . His name alone should get people to look . But I 'm concerned over the first show . I seem to remember , Loomer , you were the one who raised the doubts . Mind repeating them ? You birds phrase stuff so much better than me . " He was doing all right , Thrasher thought . Getting Loomer to articulate his objections was his way of putting the problem back in their camp . " All I said was that this doctor , this Abelman chap , whoever he is , may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opening show . I warned Mr. Gatling that there was a kind of depressing air about the neighborhood , about the doctor himself . We like to stress success , achievement . But I seemed to gather this doctor is just a kind of  --  well  --  stick-in-the-mud sort . " " That 's because you do n't know him , " Thrasher said . " If I do n't  --  if none of us do  --  it 's your fault . Keeping us all in the dark . Doing all the work yourself . " Loomer sounded petulant . Van Alst made a quick notation in his little book . Thrasher shifted unhappily . " Okay , Ben . I 'll give you daily reports if you want ' em . " Then , brightly , he added , " Say , why do n't you and Tom and Teddy  --  and even you , Mr. Gatling  --  come out to Brooklyn with me for my next session ? It 's only a short ride ? " Loomer was shaking his head and Thrasher congratulated himself . They wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in the know : but the actual doing represented too much of a risk . You could n't be blamed for anything if you were sufficiently ignorant . " I think Ted should go along with you , " Loomer said , " but Tom and I are too busy , and I 'm sure Mr. Gatling ca n't be bothered . " Slumped deep in his seat , the drugmaker was studying them in mournful boredom . " Say , Thrasher , " he said loudly , " what is there so special about this old pill-roller ? I 've known as many doctors as any man alive and , hell , they 're the damndest bunch of stuffed  | shirts and woodenheads I 've ever seen . What 's this guy 's name , Abelman ? " " Mr. Gatling , " Thrasher said . " Dr. Abelman is a person leading a valuable , useful life . How many of us , particularly in our field , can say the same ? Every act he does is worthwhile . And what makes it more amazing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frustrations . " " Does that make him interesting to a big audience ? The people who buy my drugs ? " " I suspect it will . We 're subjected to drones , talkers , scroungers , and confidence men so much these days that a little fresh air might get people interested . A big industry like yours could do a lot worse than take the lead in improving the public taste and attitudes . " It was a wrong move , Thrasher knew , as soon as he saw the slumping figure struggle forward , the moist fat fingers fall to the green blotter . " Back up a minute , Thrasher , " he said , and he sounded like the old head of the refining department about to eat out a careless technician . " I did n't like that crack about drones and confidence men . Because if there are any drones in industry , it 's you birds who have let ' em in . What do I have to apologize about ? What does any American industrialist have to apologize for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The way we support the government , the army , and everything else ? You talk about useful and valuable lives  --  what 's more useful than what we do , turning out good services for one hundred and sixty million people and doing it goddam well ? " " I did n't quite mean that ? " " Balls . Let me finish . You meant it , all you smart college boys in short-changed lapels and tight pants . You 're always telling us what to do , what to say , who to be nice to . You know why ? Because you got us scared . You like the color of our money , so you keep us scared stiff . I had some smart young son-of-a-bitch like you sign my name to an article for the Saturday Evening Post in support of GATT . I do n't know what GATT is . I might have liked it if the kid bothered to tell me , but there it was " GATT Helps You " by Lyman Gatling . Is that supposed to make people love us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up the double time and triple time and make good products . And I do n't like apologizing for what I do for a living . " He paused to gulp air into his soggy chest , and , surprisingly , it was Loomer who took up the challenge .  | " I think I know what you 're objecting to , Mr. Gatling , " he said sincerely , " we at Whitechapel have never been too heavy on this so-called prestige approach . We do n't do any public relations at all . Our feeling is that advertising is purely and simply an extension of a company 's own sales program . We want to sell , not create any of these alleged favorable atmospheres . " Gatling seemed not to have heard him . " Drones and confidence men , eh , Thrasher ? " he continued . " Where ? Down in our lab ? Our factories ? Our shipping and receiving departments ? It 's you birds  --  you guys with the quick words and the presentations  --  who screw everything up . You keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how we have to make people think we 're really nice . Well , I do n't care if everybody thinks I 'm a louse , just so long as they order Whiffo by the case and drink their Vita-life every morning . " " I do n't see how you can separate the two , " Thrasher ventured . " Maybe you ca n't . And maybe all I 'm objecting to is an attitude . Sure , we got our own salesmen , our own ad guys . We need ' em . We need ' em so badly we hire smart kids out of college as engineers at four thousand a year and if they 're real smart they can make fifteen thousand as salesmen after a few years . The dopes remain engineers . But do n't you or any of you other guys in tight pants drone-and-confidence me . " Loomer got up and took a little tour of the glowing velvet shrines , the artfully illumined creches , dedicated to proper bowel movements , deodorizing , and polished white teeth . He was pounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion has taken this turn , Mr. Gatling . Woody is one of these creative lads " ? he laughed unconvincingly ? " and he uses words he does n't mean every so often . The only reason we came here was to get your reading on Americans , U.S.A. I hope you 've been told enough . " The icy air-conditioner , humming faintly , did nothing for Mr. Gatling 's dewlapped face  --  it exuded a hundred little streams of perspiration . He did n't mind the heat or the sweat . He could remember working in plants where it never went below one hundred , where the heat would soften windows and buckle castiron beams . " That first show better be good . It better get people to look and it better sell Whiffo . Or screw Whitechapel . " He might have been telling a wholesaler of oil of vitriol that his last shipment contained three broken carboys ; one more like that and they 'd lose the order . " I 'll take responsibility for that , " Thrasher said quickly . Then , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the discussion , to throw some new provocation at the drug manufacturer and his own colleagues , he added , " There 's one thing you should know now about the costs for the first show , Mr. Gatling . " Loomer , Finucane , and Chilson were stunned . You did n't annoy the number one man of a giant company with details of a show budget . There were vice-presidents who worried about that . That 's what Van Alst was on hand for . " Part of the costs , " Thrasher said firmly , " will be an eightthousand-dollar fee for Dr. Abelman to help him buy a new house . " " What the hell does that have to do with me ? " Gatling roared . " Am I running a charity ? I know a little about what television talent costs , and for eight thousand bucks I do n't want some broken-down sawbones . " " When did you decide on this , Woody ? " Loomer asked . He was horrified . " Yeah  --  I saw the budget that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fee . Not on a public service show . It 's  --  it'slike paying Bishop Sheen ! " Finucane exploded . " I just thought I 'd let you all know at the start , " Thrasher said innocently . " It 's one of the conditions . " " Okay , " Loomer said malevolently . " We can argue that later . Mr. Gatling , is there anything else you want to know ? " Thrasher could see the boiling rage beneath Loomer 's slow , calm voice . The pointless gambit about the eight thousand dollars had infuriated him , as only a slow-moving and logical man can be infuriated . Gatling dismissed them without bothering to shake hands or thank them . He again mentioned Andrew Bain Lord as a must for the program . Proving he was not as ignorant or contemptuous of publicity as he had led them to believe , he advised Loomer to begin an intense campaign on the program . He cared less about the content of the show , it seemed , than the ways it could be promoted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner drugstore in the country . Apparently his bitterness over drones and confidence men had in no wise affected his understanding of their value . As they departed , he was squinting at Van Alst 's notes . Returning to their office in a cab , the agency group was silent , Loomer nursing his private fury over Thrasher 's behavior . If they were to lose the G dr T account , he would be in very bad shape . A single poor show could be blamed on Thrasher and he could be sacrificed . But when a big account went Ted Chilson spoke first . " Say , Woody , something that bothers me about that money to  | help the doctor buy a house ? " The china-blue eyes were utterly innocent : the president of student board asking the dean for a later curfew on prom night . No one looked at the young man , but , undismayed , he continued . " If we pay the doctor , give him that money to get a new house , are n't we really negating the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I get it , his complete honesty . Do n't we destroy this whole atmosphere if we pay him ? And especially so much money ? " " You 're damn right we do , " Loomer said darkly . " And I personally will make sure there 's no such payment . " It was not until late that afternoon , meeting over iced tea with Dexter Daw and Alice Taggart , that it occurred to him that Ted Chilson 's arguments against paying Dr. Abelman were identical with those he had voiced to Myron Malkin . There probably was a good deal of truth in them , too . If the story leaked to the trade that G &; T , a drug firm , had paid a physician , it would n't look good for the donor or the receiver . But neither the unfavorable publicity nor the questionable morality of the transaction disturbed Thrasher . His mission now had assumed a double goal . He had to prove to his enemies ( where had they all come from so quickly and where did they find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply because he was a better man than the lot of them . Beyond that , he wanted to be present on the bright morning when Samuel Abelman moved into the big house on Republic Street . Dexter Daw had invited them to his home in Rockland County , and , wheeling his unwashed Dodge station wagon through Harlem toward the George Washington Bridge , Thrasher found nothing but displeasure in the project . His gloom , of course , had been born of the uncomfortable meeting with Lyman Gatling and Loomer 's unconcealed rage that followed . The Saturday at home had done nothing to palliate his unhappiness . He had tried writing , drawing up an outline for the program , and had been distressed to find it was no easy task . The last dramatic scripts he had done were for a soap , on a free-lance basis , some seven years ago . The words did not come easily , they never seemed to say precisely what he envisioned so clearly in his mind . And the need to work in Andrew Bain Lord as narrator and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commentator whom Gatling regarded as a genius . In the quiet basement study , cool and dark , Ann had beautifully accessorized his desk with the anal impedimenta of the writer ? the beer mug of needle-sharp pencils , the neat stacks of onionskin  | and carbon , the scratch pads , erasers , calender , manila folders , and a mammoth ash tray . The very richness of his equipment embarrassed him ; by early afternoon he had produced only a carpet of crumpled white sheets and a single page of notations . When his son pleaded that he accompany him to the Little League game , he agreed , even though baseball bored him . Woody Junior played right field , a position which Thrasher knew was the prize of the poorest regular . But at least he did n't sit on the bench , and while his team was badly beaten , young Woody caught a pop fly , walked twice , and scored a run . In a negative way , he had acquitted himself without being the goat . Thrasher found himself thankful that the kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sweated miserably through the seven interminable innings and was as happy as the winning pitcher when the last out was made . Dressing for the evening , he had gotten into a pointless argument with Ann . She had accepted the invitation from Daw 's wife , and Thrasher felt she might have fabricated an excuse . " I see enough of Dexter Daw all week , " he complained childishly , " and do you realize it 's a two-hour drive from Stamford to Blauvelt or Grandview or whatever the name of that place is they live in ? " She only half heard him . She was pulling a new summer dress over her head , something severe and smart and bright green , with immense black circles . The sight of her headless form  --  only the lower part of the postage-stamp girdle , the lovely silken legs , and spiked emerald shoes were visible  --  aroused him . A spark of adolescent passion flickered , and while she struggled with the dress , he pinched her tanned thigh just above the stocking . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . Ann was always at her best before a party . The clean hard face , with minimal make-up , glowed ; the close-cropped hair smelled of some honest perfume ; her dress had an original , startling quality . A few harmless passes would be made at her , she would get reasonably drunk , and would get the best of at least one egghead in some kind of aesthetic argument . " Is n't it disgusting the way a pair of detachable garters and high heels can change a man 's outlook ? " he said . He slipped to his knees , embracing her legs . " Enough , " she said , stroking his head . " Save it for later . " " I wo n't be fit for anything after that two-hour haul through the Eastern Seaboard . Why must Dexter Daw live in Rockland County ? " " Stop being negative , " she said firmly , pulling away from him and straightening out her skirt . She began installing a series of immense Mexican bracelets on her lean brown arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about Americans , U.S.A. and Ben Loomer and Dr. Abelman tonight . Get good and drunk . Get into an argument . But do n't talk shop , please , Woody . " Crossing the George Washington Bridge , he found himself lecturing Ann on the folklore of suburbia . For some irrational reason , he was annoyed with Daw for choosing Rockland County , with its conscious rusticity and artiness , over conventional Westchester and upper-bracket Fairfield County . Moreover , he found himself sticking up manfully for Long Island . When he and Ann had first gone house hunting , having had their fill of drafty brownstones , he had seen any number of magnificent development-type split levels in Nassau County . They were huge , solidly built homes ; room after room with immense closets , well-appointed bathrooms , dens , basements , and cavernous garages . For $22,500 he could have bought such a home  --  a model that could not have been duplicated in Connecticut or Westchester for $40,000 . But Ann and his friends at the agency had dissuaded him . Nobody but stationery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were copywriters earning half his salary who were building in Rye and Westport ; on the vice-presidential level he had no right to get his money 's worth on a mass-produced split-level . Often , Thrasher thought of the stocks he might have bought , the mutual fund he could have started with the cash he would have saved with the Long Island house . But it was out of the question . He wondered how all these small-town boys and girls , the seminarians of talker society , knew instinctively where to live . Did the Dexter Daws go to some clearinghouse where they were advised not to live on Long Island , not to live on the West Side , not to drive Dodges and Plymouths , but to acquire MG 's or at least Ilillmans ? Who made the rules ? He had seen youngsters fresh from Davenport , Iowa , or Billings , Montana , arrive in New York , and , with the innate motivation of army ants , make all the right moves . It was the native New Yorkers  --  the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who purchased development homes in Roslyn , drove large , utilitarian American cars , and bought their suits in Rogers Peet or Browning King . With cruel delight , he retold an incident at the office last week when Dexter Daw  --  who made a point of introducing himself to any reasonably attractive woman  --  had begun a casual conversation with Lucille LoPresti , the assistant commercial co-ordinator . Lucille was a formidable Neapolitan beauty with aggressive breasts and a fine black mustache . She was loud , funny , and virginal , but Dexter Daw saw nothing to lose in some exploratory small talk . He had  | announced , with casual pride ( after depicting himself as a key man at the network who might do things for her ) that he lived in Rockland County . " Whereabouts ? " Lucille LoPresti asked . " A charming little town called Piermont , " Daw said airily . " It 's really quite unspoiled . You know  --  none of this Madison Avenue pretense . " Lucille laughed a hearty Parkchester guffaw . " Piermont ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's so funny ? " Daw had asked . " Piermont , " Lucille said flatly , " is where my father drinks beer with Vinnie Rotunda on Saturday nights ! " Daw had been properly crushed : the vision of Rockland County , the rustic , unaffected country place where artists and writers mingled in an atmosphere of honest stimulation , was annihilated . Instead , Lucille had put Piermont in proper perspective  --  a nest of cramped Italian homes and dreary saloons where Nick LoPresti and Vinnie Rotunda drank beer . Daw 's house was a mongrelized accumulation of dirty white revolutionary war walls , a feverish tile roof out of the twenties , and a yellow stucco wing , flaking and discolored . It squatted , surly and inhospitable , on an irregular mountainous plot , overgrown with crab grass and an ungroomed grape arbor . The guests seemed to have no center of gravity : the house had no true living room , and at least three crumbling patios . People drifted in the riverbank heat , from faded deck chair to peeling Adirondack bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the not-so-early American parlor , a patch of sloping boards built around a rock quarry fireplace . " Not an appliance jobber in the lot , " Thrasher muttered as they parked the station wagon on a precarious slant , an asphalt goat path , already jammed with MG 's and other deformed foreign cars . Most of the guests were from the outer fringes of talkerdom : a jolly couple who worked for the AP and came from Hastings , Nebraska ; a junior copywriter at a major agency who had written an excellent first novel about life in his home town , Orono , Maine ; an assistant professor of English at Columbia 's School of General Studies , who told charming anecdotes about his " kinfolk " in Tullahoma , Tennessee ; and a middle-aged lady photographer who had lived on the same block with Freud . Thrasher realized that Daw was paying him a sincere compliment by inviting him . These were creative people , bright creative people , as opposed to stodgy clods like himself ( and Daw for that matter )  | who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daw 's checkered lawn , he resigned himself to getting drunk , aware that he would reap only a headache and a fit of yawning from Daw 's cheap gin . They would run out of tonic and ice in a few hours , lie was certain , and he would end up desperately sipping gin and lukewarm club soda . He stopped short , halfway up the ascent , childishly terrified by the tableau on Daw 's gingerbread porch . The youthful director , quite drunk and talkative , was sitting in between his wife and Alice Taggart , bobbing and weaving his fetal head like the moderator of a panel show warming up two recalcitrant guests . Daw 's wife was a head taller than her husband . She was a perpetually morbid young woman , all bones and lank black hair , who had left Provo , Utah , for a modeling career . Of the trio , she alone seemed miserable ; Alice seemed unusually gay . Thrasher felt a spreading numbness in his abdomen ; there was no doubt Daw had invited her deliberately , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Alice looked marvelous  --  crisp and fresh in a pink button-down shirtwaist , the skirt billowing over crinoline . Enough of her thin legs was exposed so that any normal male would want to plunge both arms under the clouds of petticoats and explore the rest of her . Daw staggered from the creaky porch hammock on which he was conducting his seminar and greeted the Thrashers effusively . " Hi there , kids ! Miz Thrasher , it 's a pleasure . . . you coming all the way from Connecticut . We were taking bets old Woody could n't bear to leave the flagstone patio district , but I see you convinced him the slumming would do his soul good . " Ann smiled pleasantly . " It was n't a bad trip . And I 've heard so much about Rockland County , I really was anxious to come . Your house is charming . " Mrs. Daw untangled a pair of stork 's legs and stood up . " I 'm Mary Jo Daw , Mrs. Th ? " " Ann . Ili . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thrasher shuddered faintly , noting at the same time that of the three nasally intoned " Hi 's " ? the official Eastern Seaboard greeting of the upper five percent income bracket  --  only Ann 's had a true ring . They were all spurious , of course , but his wife had been in summer stock . She 'd " Hi " them to death , those two yokels . " Yep , " Daw said , " li'l ole nymphomaniacal Alice . Alice works for the network and she 's aiding and abetting ole Woodrow Wilson and young Dexter Daw on our doctor project . "  | " Oh  --  gee  --  it 's a real Americans , U.S.A. party ! " Ann said brightly . " What do you do , Alice ? " Daw ground a fragment of an ice cube in his teeth , and before Alice could answer , he fairly shouted , " Know that old song , Ann ? ' What she wo n't do her sister will ' ? Well , Alice here is the sister they wrote that about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contour chair , all aluminum tubing and saran webbing . Watching Alice 's bony , self-controlled face , Thrasher had to hand it to her . Daw 's disgusting rudeness had cut deep , yet she would not give him the satisfaction of a slap , or even a mild rejoinder . Instead , she turned to Ann and offered a harmless little lie . " I 'm delighted to meet you , Ann , really . Woody talks about you all the time . " They would be buddies to the end : soon Ann was sitting next to her in an unraveling wicker chair . She was asking Alice Taggart precisely what she did at the network , what an A.D. 's functions were , advising her how jealous she was of those lucky girls who had stuck to creative careers instead of vegetating as den mothers and PTA cake sale chairmen . Thrasher located the English professor and listened to a prepared text on the evils of television . He had hoped that the opening gambit would have varied , but the young man from Tullahoma was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties . " Television has great potential , " the professor began , " but , really , when are you guys going to grow up ? " " You do n't like it , turn it off , " Thrasher said . " No one holds a gun to your head and makes you watch . " From there , Thrasher advanced his usual arguments : all the good stuff on television , the relative percentages of bad plays , had books , and bad movies ; the original writing and directing TV was creating ; the possibilities of educational TV . Thrasher found these conversations like sports interviews or Greek tragedies  --  the laws were rigid , the sequence of dialogue predetermined . They always terminated in mutual agreement that television had a great future . Returning to the front porch with a cracked tumbler of Macy 's gin and soda , he paused , fascinated by the startling similarity of his wife and the girl he had been sleeping with . Their blond , cropped heads were nodding at each other animatedly ; two trim , sharply outlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arms and hands were alike . He could hear his own name being kicked around , and he knew that there was a little too much enthusiasm in their voices , a little too much  | eagerness in their desire to be pals to hope that Ann had n't gauged Alice Taggart 's relationship with her husband properly . He sat opposite them on a splintering porch rail , trying to be aloof and neutral . The gin , oddly enough , had calmed his nerves and he felt equal to the delicate balance . " Topic of discussion number one , " said Alice , laughing . " We 're giving you the works , Woody . " " Alice seems to feel , dear , that this new job you 've tackled is changing you . I told her I 've noticed it too . It 's like  --  well  --  as if you were a prize-winning playwright trying to outdo himself . It 's not just that you 're tense ? " " ? we 're past tense , we 're living in bungalows now , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Alice cried . " And right after that they sing Abie the fishman . ' " She was the kind who went to Marx Brothers pictures at the Museum of Modern Art . As a kid back in Ontario , California , she never saw anything funny about Groucho . Today , she could recite whole scenes from Coconuts . " Seriously , " Ann persisted , " we both said how tense you 've been lately , but we also feel  --  and tell me if I 'm wrong , Alice  --  that you seem to be in a kind of , well , rebellion . You 're negative . You do n't like anyone or anything , really . And you do n't get enthusiastic over things the way you used to . " Alice was nodding her head affirmatively . " You 're like the fellows in those novels that are going to expose the advertising business . Nobody 's any good but yourself after a while , and everything is rotten . He is n't really that way is he , Ann ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her share of Dexter Daw 's gin , ice or no ice , and the PTA in her was losing out . " Woody , I 've heard you argue about all the good your business does  --  and I know you believe it . You know , about spreading goods and services , creating more jobs , and putting more money and products in circulation . " " And raising the standard of living , Alice said quickly . " Girls , girls , for Christ 's sake , " Thrasher interrupted . " This sounds like Economics 1-2 , Monday , Wednesday , and Friday at 9 A.M. three points , in the freshman curriculum at South Dakota State . Does anybody know any good dirty jokes for a change ? " " Oh , Hattie Loomer told me this one ! " Ann said , with a faint hysterical start . It occurred to Thrasher she had been forcing herself into a state of strained gaiety with his mistress , and that the chance for a risque story offered a handy release .  | " This boss and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this building where his office was , and she said , I think I 'm going to have a baby and I 'm going to throw myself out the window . ' So he patted her knee and said , That 's a good girl . ' " " It 's an old story , dear , " Thrasher said . " I heard it about a movie producer and a starlet in an airplane . " " I 'm terribly sorry , " Alice said , " I 'm not sure I get it . " Dexter Daw , a pitcher of water in his pink hand , fell into their circle . " She was knocked up , Alice , get it ? And the boss knocked her up , so he was very happy she was going to commit suicide ? Catch ? You know girls get knocked up sometimes . You know the one about the pregnant lady and the lion cage ? " Their silence bleakly informed Dexter Daw that nobody appreciated his program notes . Ann suddenly found it mandatory to wash her hands ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dialogue with the English professor . Departing , he heard Daw mumbling to Alice , " It 's cool in the root cellar , Taggart , " he said huskily , " let 's you ' n ' me go looking for rutabagas . " The long ride home has scarcely begun when Thrasher heard his wife weeping . Her crying was not the kind he would have expected of her ; it came in thin , almost inaudible squeaks , the tears trickling neatly down her flat cheeks in cadence with each high-pitched sniffle . " How is she ? " Ann asked . " Real good in bed ? " He sped desperately by the sordid New Jersey landscape of usedcar lots and hot-dog stands . The gin was leaving a sour , raw feeling in the pit of his stomach . The first pinching pain of a headache was creeping up his right temple . " If you insist , dear , she 's not bad at all . Okay , you know . I slept with her . So did Dexter Daw and so did four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry ? That wo n't help . Should I get on one knee and ask forgiveness ? For Christ 's sake , Ann , these things happen . There 's more of this going on than any wife likes to admit . " " She looks like me , " Ann said dully . " She does , as a matter of fact , " he said . " Enough to be a sister . I often wondered why she attracted me because of that . When a man cheats he usually looks for a different dish . Guys with washboardthin wives usually go for the big , fat type . But me , I 'm original . " " You 're not making me feel any better , " she wailed . " Ah , come on , Ann , cut it out . You 've suspected me a long time , and now you know . We do n't suddenly drop dead , or get a divorce or get analyzed . It happened , it 's over , we 're still married . " " Was she the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one . " At this stage , he felt , a small lie would'nt be of any harm . And , actually , she was the only one as of that moment . Moreover , it had been a week since he had slept with Alice . " And let me tell you a few things about marital infidelity , " Thrasher said wearily . " It ai n't nearly the fun you 'd think it would be . It 's all anticipation , daydreaming , desire at your desk in midafternoon . You 're in , you 're it , you 're out . " " Maybe that 's the way you feel about marriage too . " " No , there 's never that much anticipation connected with marriage . " " Oh , this is the living end ! " she cried , sufficently exasperated with him so that her tears ceased . " Is this a recent Thrasher platitude ? Was this how you felt twelve years ago ? " " It 's pretty recent . I 've come to the conclusion everything we do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big risks , big thrills , big loves , and big hates . Everything is sort of medium . And you should n't expect a marriage to be the be-all and end-all . If it 's got flaws , so has everything else . " " Well , I hope ours is n't anything but flaws . " He was so incredibly exhausted that he had to keep shifting the position of his arms and hands on the wheel to prevent cramps from developing . The back of his neck and upper spine felt as if someone had worked over it with a hoe handle . He had enjoyed the thought of his wife 's thin legs , the high green heels , the ridiculous elastic girdle . It had made the overland trek to the other side of the Hudson seem almost bearable because of the prize at evening 's end . But he knew he 'd never make it . It would be seconal and out for him . " Woods , let 's pull the big switch on suburbia tomorrow , " she said eagerly , patting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink double martinis at Camillo 's and then take in a foreign movie . And maybe for old time 's sake we 'll drop in at Tim 's for a nightcap with some of your friends . " " I 'm sorry , honey , I have to go to Brooklyn again . Daw and I have some work to finish up with the doctor . " By including Daw he had hoped to remove some of the burden of guilt for neglecting his family . " I 'm beginning to hate him . Your hero . " " Not quite , dear . My interest in Samuel Abelman is strictly business . I 've committed myself to doing a successful show with him . If I flop , there 's a good chance we 'll be back in a brownstone walkup . For your peace of mind , I do n't think I can lose everything .  | I 'm high enough up now so that the conspiracy will protect me . " " What conspiracy ? " " The one that says the high-up fellows have to be protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Makes it look bad for all the other high-up fellows . If you let enough of us prove publicly that we are fools and knaves , it 's The Emperor 's New Clothes ' all over again . " " You do n't act as though it 's purely business . " She sounded suspicious , keenly aware of some startling alteration in her husband  --  a change which this obscure , profane physician was working on him in some cabalistic fashion . " Why are you so set on buying him a house ? Why is that so important to you ? " He slowed down briefly before approaching a hairpin curve , and then , recalling some advice from a friendly disc jockey who dabbled in sports cars , he accelerated on the turn itself , delighted to discover that the Dodge held the road nicely . " Because the bastards wo n't let him live , " he snapped " And they 're starting on me now . "  | HERMAN QUINCY had returned on Sunday for a series of head X-rays . He seemed less surly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a realization of the seriousness of his illness and his need for the doctor , or simple street-corner indifference , the physician could not say . The doctor took four roentgenograms of the small bronze head  --  two lateral views , an antero-posterior and a postero-anterior . Turning and bending the boy 's brown poll , studying the black indifferent eyes , the pneumatic lips , he wondered if this seventeenyear-old could really be so bad . It seemed impossible . His patients were n't galoots . Okay , the kid took dope , and he 'd go to work on that as soon as he had figured out the current symptoms . Maybe he had dumped the girl on his doorstep and maybe not ; maybe he and his chums had beaten up the old man in the park and the night watchman at the project . It was n't his business to find out . Let the cops , that social worker Kaplan , worry about it . Dismissing Herman and his mother with another warning to let him know the instant the boy showed symptoms of convulsions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew what the neurologists said : standard roentgenograms rarely imparted information on intracranial tumors . But he had sometimes found that the tendency of specialists to minimize basic diagnostic methods was simply due to their unfamiliarity with them . They knew all about the fancy stuff , the ventriculograms and the pneumoencephalograms , but they ran like thieves when you showed them a simple plate and asked them to read it . In late afternoon he was studying the pictures a second time . With him was another general practitioner , a doctor with whom he had graduated from Bellevue more than forty years ago , and whose office was located a few blocks away . He was a man a year or two younger than Dr. Abelman , with the ruddy glow of hypertension in his cheeks . The men were alike in many ways , yet the essential difference between the two might have divined from a study of the shirts they were wearing . Dr. Abelman 's was a cheap blue sport shirt . The floppy , elongated collar had never been meant for union with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for high fashion , knotted a stained dark-brown four-in-hand around his  | neck , and the ensuing disaster was evident in the ripples , folds , and asymmetry of collar , tie , and shirt front . Max Vogel , M.D. , on the other hand , cool and neat in the humid office , wore an imported Swiss voile job , the trim collar designed for tieless or dress wear . Its secret little slots held firm plastic stiffeners . A sky-blue tie of light silk was knotted artfully over the hidden button . Max Vogel could , after donning his navy silk mohair jacket , have walked into 21 and outbluffed the headwaiter . " What do you see , Maxie ? " Dr. Abelman asked . " You 're a smart GP , let 's see how much you know . " Vogel flipped a pair of gold-rimmed glasses onto his mushroom cap of a nose . He dressed like a dandy and drove a two-tone Mercury hard-top , but there was nothing of the fop in Max Vogel 's attitudes or manner of speech . He spat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  glib , articulate , self-assured . " It looks to me like clap . " " Cut it out , Maxie , " Dr. Abelman said . He chuckled , did a little dance step , and slapped his thigh . It was clear that in Dr. Abelman 's eyes the world had never seen the equal of Max Vogel 's wit . " Give me it straight , Maxie , what 's he got ? " " Gim me some history . Who am I , Harlow Brooks ? " " Seventeen years old , Negro male . History of three convulsions , poorly described , maybe affecting the right side . Mother seems to recall fingers and hand started the seizure . Subject reports recent brief , morning headaches . No nausea . Papilledema , maybe . Vogel squinted at a right lateral view . " You pessimistic bastard , " he said , " I know what you 're thinking already . How about weakness and paralysis in the limbs ? " " Not really . I hand wrestled the kid on the desk and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Max Vogel dabbed at his moist forehead with a spotless linen handkerchief . " What the hell is wrong with you , Sam ? Are you still a goddam gymnasium teacher ? No wonder you lose patients . If you ever got a coronary , you 'd probably try running around the block a few times . " " I did it mostly to win the kid over . " " Will you do me a favor and stop winning patients over ? You get personally involved with all these shmucks . Patients are slobs . You got to scare ' em , keep ' em scared , and bulldoze ' em . Do n't make friends with a patient , ever . Do n't even let him think you really care about him . Ah , you 'll never learn , will you , Sammy ? " " What do you want me to do ? " Dr. Abelman removed the lateral  | view from the illuminator and placed the frontal plate on it . The two of them peered at it , searching the deceptive shadows and lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen . " " What did any boogie ever do for you ? " Vogel sneered . Dr. Abelman shrugged , defensively embarrassed . " Oh , I know , I complain about them a lot . But they got a right to live . " " Not by sucking my blood , " Vogel said . " Better yours . " " What do you make of these shadows over here ? " He had placed the second lateral view on the illuminated box now , and they were both studying it intensely . " It might be convolutional atrophy , " Vogel said quickly . " Yeh , " Abelman said quietly , " digital impressions . It 's supposed to be like sticking your fingers in clay . Have you ever seen any before ? " " A few . It 's not necessarily typical . You get this when the intracranial tension has existed a fairly long time . Of course , this kid has a history of three convulsions and does n't know how long he 's been getting headaches . " Dr. Abelman stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull would come to life and supply him with the answers he needed . A single bead of sweat rolled down his straining forehead , down the arched slope of his nose and dropped to the dark-brown tie . There did indeed seem to be an uneven absorption of the inner table of the cranium ; the absorbed areas appeared to be separated by faint ridges , little dark semicircles like the imprints of a child 's fingers . He was hoping that Max Vogel would make a quick , expert diagnosis , something in keeping with Max 's own sure approach to the problems of life . But Dr. Vogel was too good a clinician to commit himself to a fast decision based solely on the deceptive shadows on the electric box . Dr. Abelman understood this , too . lie rarely called in other doctors to aid him in reaching a judo nwnt : but Max was somebody special . Max , for all his crudeness , his cake-eater clothes , and his wiseacre answers , was a superb lle ( beal man . " I 'll tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " l t does n't mean a damn thing if there are no other manifestations . I 've seen it in normal children and adults also . " " You ca n't discount it , Maxie . " " No , but do n't go basing a diagnosis on it . What else are you looking for , Sanlnry ? " Dr. Abelman squinted belligerently at the X-ray . " Calcification ,  | only I do n't see any . " He placed the postero-anterior plate on the box . " If you find any , write me a letter . I 'll tell you something else , Sam . Calcification does n't prove anything either . It happens in normal craniums where there 's no trace of a neoplasm . " The host physician flicked off the illuminator and opened the office door . " Why is it , Maxie , that the professors always tell us to look for certain things , and when we find ' em , they warn us it 's not necessarily the real thing ? " " That 's why they 're professors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway . " Dem two men fum de telewision is here . Dey in deh yard wif deh rest . " " Oh , those two ! " Dr. Abelman said . " Hey , Maxie , those two guys who are making a Boris Thomashefsky out of me are here . C'm on , you got ta meet them . You 'll like them , two nice goyim . You , with the Broadway plays and the operas  --  you 'll get along fine with them ! " He led his old classmate through the cool hallway , the narrow kitchen , into the bright heat of the backyard . Diane galumphed toward them , a slobbering mass of dirty hair and oversized paws . She tried to leap on to Vogel 's knife-creased mohair trousers , and he sent her into confused retreat with a deft kick of his pointed black suede shoe . Under the natural awning of the cherry and magnolia trees , a hesitant little party had begun . The hosts were the doctor 's daughter Eunice and her husband , and their seven-yearold daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old stools and frayed beach chairs , surrounding their two guests : Thrasher and Daw nailed to the ungentle slats of the half-buried bench . The little girl was passing around a tray of cream soda and a bowl of summer fruit . " Well , I guess everyone knows everyone by now , " Dr. Abelman said cheerfully . " Mr. Thrasher and your little friend  --  what 's your name ? ? you 've met my daughter Eunice Platt , and my son-in-law Harry Platt ; and my little ketzeleh Marsha . " Thrasher and Daw nodded politely . " Oh , and let 's not forget Maxie ! " Ceremoniously , he guided his colleague to the bench , indicating that Max Vogel , M.D. , held a special , revered place in his catalogue of associates . " Mr. Thrasher and Mr. Daw , you better be nice to this big clunk . If you 're doing my life story , he 's part of it . " Vogel shook hands firmly . His alert , quick eyes sized them up as aliens to Sam Abelman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vogel , would have no trouble communicating . They dealt in words , in guises , in moods  --  and Vogel had used these elements in his  | practice of medicine many years before either of them had dreamed of their careers as successful talkers . " Whaddya wan na bother with this old klutz for ? " he asked nastily . " Do a show about me ! The biggest gonifl in Brooklyn ! Ask Sammy about me ! " The roguishness , Thrasher sensed , had a double edge . There was real affection in Vogel 's manner ; at the same time , he almost seemed convinced that he was a better subject for a wide publicity campaign , that Sam Abelman would never in a million years know how to turn the benefits of a TV program into cash . Vogel walked quickly to a sagging beach chair and sat down spryly . Watching him , Thrasher realized that something in his appearance did n't ring true . It dawned on him suddenly : Vogel was of moderate physique , almost lean , yet he had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat man . The rolling gait , the red cheeks , the button nose , the falsely merry eyes , the glib manner of speaking : all these were the accessories of a Falstaff . He smiled at Vogel and said politely , " Dr. Vogel , I 'll bet you once lost a lot of weight . " Vogel slapped his knee . " Another lousy internist , Sam ! You 're right . I took off fifty pounds three years ago . I had a coronary occlusion  --  a beaut . This old bum here pulled me through . I would n't let a specialist touch me , even though this guy almost killed me . " " Hoo hah ! " Dr. Abelman crowed . " I put you on that diet , too , and almost killed you again ! Boy , what a myocardial infarction ! " Thrasher could see the dovetailed precision of their relationship : Dr. Abelman , the worrier , the perpetually outraged , the tilter at windmills , and Max Vogel , the nose-thumber , the rogue , the irreverent opportunist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , you old futz , " Vogel said . " You once treated a guy for yellow jaundice for a month before you found out he was a Chink . " The doctor 's granddaughter , a pigtailed child , with sharp , precocious eyes , ran to Vogel , punching him playfully on the pleated pocket of his twelve-dollar shirt . " Grampa is not old . You 're old ! " " Marsha ! " the doctor 's daughter said sharply . " That 's not nice . Tell Uncle Max you 're sorry ! " " I 'm not ! He called my grampa old ! " " Eunice , you got ta stop cramming vitamins down this kid 's yap , " Vogel said . " They overfeed ' em today . If the body ca n't  | absorb all that stuff , it goes into the nervous system and look what happens . " The doctor 's daughter and the son-in-law laughed , taking no offense . She was an attractive , mildly stout young woman , with the doctor 's strong , dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stoop-shouldered and long-armed . Both of them regarded Vogel with the same humorous affection as did Dr. Abelman ; he supplied something missing in their orderly , moral lives . " Marsha , " Eunice Platt said , " tell Grampa what you 're doing next week . " " I 'm going back to school ! " She ran to Dr. Abelman , squeezing between his knees . " What do you like most about school , ketzeleh ? " the old man asked . She titled her nose up toward the thick green roof of the cherry tree . " Raymond DeVito is the worst boy in the class , " she said proudly . " He never wears a white shirt and his sneakers have holes . " " Tsk-tsk , " the doctor said sadly , " you should n't be so happy about it . Maybe his mommy and his poppy have n't enough money to buy a white shirt . " Thrasher felt a subtle justification for his choice of the doctor as a subject for Americans , U.S.A. How better gauge a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had holes in his sneakers ? He really did n't have to defend Raymond DeVito from his granddaughter 's delighted denunciation . Eunice rose from a deck chair . There was evidence of the doctor 's own repair work in the patched seat . " Harry , we 'd better get going . Marsha is getting overstimulated and she 'll never sleep tonight . " Thrasher and Daw were on their feet , almost too quickly , as if they were more than willing to have the doctor 's relatives depart . They had both been constructing their own private versions of Samuel Abelman and the intrusion of too much reality  --  particularly in the persons of these normal , middle-class people who were his family  --  was disconcerting them . Vogel was a different story : he was theatrical enough to mesh with their own world of make-believe . The doctor shook hands warmly with his son-in-law . " Take it easy on the nightwork , pop , " he said , " and give our love to Mom . By now she 's at least the mahjong champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bother me . To hell with ' em . I can take it or leave it . " " You 'll get your coronary yet , " Vogel said , and laughed loudly , as if he almost were anxious to see his dearest friend so afflicted . Dr. Abelman kissed his daughter and his granddaughter , and the three of them , accompanied by Diane 's frantic leaps and yelps , departed . Thrasher and Daw , coatless and perspiring , resumed their buttock-scarring perches on the slatted bench . The wah-wah-wah of a young Negro playing Tarzan in a giant poplar echoed through the yard . In the adjoining plot of ground , through the doctor 's fading picket fence , the elder Baumgarts , two monoliths out of mankind 's past , walked stolidly through their proud weeds . Four eyes peered from under venerable lids through the spaces in the fence ; anyone in Abelman 's yard was as much their adversary as the doctor himself . Arm in arm , they continued their stately promenade . Once , the white-thatched man stooped to pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth . " Do n't throw it over , Baumgart ! " Dr. Abelman cried . " We got witnesses ! " " Shud up you fresh mout ' , " the old man muttered . " You sleep mit deh schwartzer , " his loyal wife added . They marched , untroubled , through the wasteland . " That young Baumgart sure inherited all the fine qualities of his parents , " Vogel said . " I 've seen him take patients from his own cousin . I got ta hand it to him . " " I do n't , " said Dr. Abelman . " What the hell is to admire in that ? " " It got him that mansion on Republic Street . " Dr. Abelman made a flat , disgusted gesture with his thick forearm . " What does it prove ? " Vogel jerked a thumb in the direction of his friend and spoke to Thrasher and Daw . " It 's not that he 's so honest , fellahs , he 's just stupid . Ile makes friends out of patients , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff of their doctor . I wear a white coat that buttons up to my neck and I hire an Irish nurse who wiggles her ass on schedule . I put red lights ' that do n't mean anything on the diathermy , and I wo n't let a patient call me by my first name . " " And what did it get you ? " Dr. Abelman broke in . " A coronary ! " " I think there 's something to be said for both points of view , " Thrasher said . " I 'm no medical man , but I would think a doctor could be both a friend to his patients and at the same time command their respect . " " Impossible , " said Vogel . " All patients stink . " Daw said nothing . Within his protuberant skull he was mulling  | over the admirable simile of the meaningless red light on the diathermy . His business was full of those blinking red lights . Thrasher 's pad came out of the folded cord jacket ; his pen was poised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abelman ? " he asked . The doctor stretched his short legs . " Might as well get into Bellevue . You 're lucky Maxie is here because he went through the joint with me . Or better , I dragged him . " The thin-fat face laughed  --  more sincerely it seemed to Thrasher than he had before . " Oh baby , were we a couple poor slobs ! " " You were poorer than me , Maxie . " " Listen , my old man kicked me in the ass when I said I was going to medical college . He saw a great future for me cleaning fish in his store , the cheap bum . " " How about your father , Dr. Abelman ? " Thrasher asked . The doctor was staring mistily into his cornfield . It was a long way back to 1908 when he had entered Bellevue . IIe was thinking of what his father had said to him when he learned his son had been accepted by the medical college . The old man had told him that he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical college during the day would mean that Sam 's earning capacity would be cut down if not altogether eliminated . Now lie would be able to teach gymnasium classes only during his summer vacation . These earnings along with his savings , and what he was borrowing from Malkin the elder , would just barely take care of tuition , books , and lab fees . Reb Yankel the tailor presented his son with a new black suit , a fitting garment for a doctor-to-be , and informed him ( to Sam 's complete surprise ) that he wanted to contribute fifty cents a day to his expenses . The old tailor had figured it out  --  twenty cents for carfare , a dime each way , and twenty cents for lunch . Recalling it , the doctor could almost feel his father 's hesitant handclasp as he pressed the first half-dollar into his palm . He and his father almost never spoke any more : the son had entered the new environment wholeheartedly , and had shaken the old rules , the old man prayed every day and avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch , Maxie , and we both had to walk home from Bellevue ? " Dr. Abelman asked . " We ate in the Physical Culture Restaurant on Second Avenue , " Vogel chuckled . " For twenty cents , a bowl of black bean soup , enough to feed a roomful of interns , two slabs of whole-wheat bread , and a hunk of apple pie the size of an infected spleen . Oh , I forgot , a tumbler of milk ! The best lunch I ever ate . "  | Dr. Abelman slapped his iron stomach , delighted by the reminiscence . " We did n't call you Crazy Maxie for nothing ! When you had the dough you could eat two of those lunches ! " " Bellevue must have been a challenging and exciting place in those days , " Thrasher said . Dr. Abelman sighed . " I loved the lousy place . " Slonimsky is a bum , Slonimsky is a bum , He never sends no heat up , Slonimsky is a bum . Slonimsky was their landlord ; the tune was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aaron Abelman , now sole residents of the dark , cheerless second bedroom of the railroad flat , would greet each chill winter 's morning with the disrespectful serenade . Their bare feet curled from rugless floors . No hot water heater eased the frigid grip of Slonimsky 's castle ; they shrieked as they tossed the gelid tap water onto their faces . Sam , now twenty-three and in the middle of his third year of medical college , had a nine o'clock class to make each weekday . Aaron , the family baby , worked in a costume jewelry factory on Lafayette Street . He was nineteen  --  bright , intense , and so frail that Sam wondered how he got through a day 's work . Yet , he had to admit , the kid had courage and he had brains . He was learning the business thoroughly . In a year or two he would go out on his own ( if he lived that long ) . Their breakfast was a seeded roll , thinly buttered , and a cup of tea . Through the peeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see their father saying his morning prayers , the tight thongs of the phylacteries bound about his head and right arm , a stern reminder of the old rules which his sons were so happily abandoning . Sam leafed through Cunningham 's Anatomy while sipping the scalding tea . He had to squint at the minuscule type ; they were not permitted to use the single kitchen bulb during the day . His parents shuffled in , bringing the sounds , the smell , the look of defeat with them . Sadly , Sam decided he was a mutant , a sport : where else did his strength and his ambition come from ? Two and one half years of medical schooling had taught him the importance of family history . He had heard Harlow Brooks tell them again and again  --  study the family past , learn about the patient 's antecedents . Yet how did you explain his own departure from these bowed and beaten people ? The other children had followed the pattern  --  there  | was a damp sadness about them . Moishe , now living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a shirt factory ; Rivke raising a family of small galitizianers ; Aaron always a heartbeat away from the dark pit . His father performed his morning ritual  --  pressing into Sam 's outstretched palm two quarters , his daily allowance to help his son through the strange maze of the goyishe college . " Thanks , papa , " he said cheerfully . " You 're a regular Rockefeller . " The old man nodded indifferently ; he had no time for jokes . Sam knew the tailoring business was suffering . He could no longer work as fast as when he opened the shop on Ludlow Street ; competition from the big manufacturing houses was taking customers away every day . More and more he would cart home work to be finished on the wheezing , earsplitting Singer in his bedroom . It was January , the streets lumpy with filth-strewn snowbanks . Halfhearted attempts to burn garbage on the dirty white heapings had left blackened smudges , pockets of potato peelings , and eggshells , where stray dogs nosed about for breakfast . Aaron and his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lower East Side . Sam had a fifteen-minute walk to the corner of Fulton Street and Saratoga Avenue , where he picked up the BrooklynManhattan Elevated . The ghetto people were on their way to work ? Brownsville auslanders making their sodden pilgrimages to the East Side , to lower Manhattan . The old-timers , the illiterates , the uneducated went to the garment lofts , the textile houses . The more ambitious younger folk , beneficiaries of the new land 's liberal educational opportunities , worked in offices , in schools , in retail stores . Sam was among the lucky few who had insisted on something better . Watching his neighbors , wrapped in bulky dark coats , scurrying through the slushy underfooting to the elevated , he could not find time to feel superior . He had midyear examinations all that week  --  clinical medicine , special pathology , surgery , obstetrics , and therapeutics . They would come thick and fast , one delightful ordeal after another . He enjoyed the challenge ; he knew he would do well . In two and one-half years of exhausting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the upper third of his class , a quiet , studious young man , a year or so older than most of his fellows , a solemn commuter , in ill-fitting clothes , lugging the badge of the day student ? the scarred , overstuffed brief case . He was reviewing in his mind the steps in a neurological examination  --  just the way Brooks had outlined them the week before  --  when he saw Dr. Lemkau standing beside his haughty air-cooled Franklin . Lemkau was the grand old gent of the Brownsville medical corps : a portly , goateed Senator of  | a man . He wore a swallowtailed coat and a floppy bow tie and looked down his nose at patients through a pair of octagonal specs on a black string . Sam saw him sniffing the cold morning air as if he owned it , flapping his long arms , then lifting his black calfskin satchel and climbing stiffly into the lofty perch of the Franklin . In a few years , Sam thought , he 'd be competing with Lemkau for patients . IIe was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little sorry for the old codger in his air-cooled buggy . The elevated lurched and clattered off for the long jerking ride through Fulton Street , through downtown Brooklyn , the lair of the ward heeler and the ambulance chaser , and then across the great sweeping curve of the Brooklyn Bridge . Crushed in the narrow seat between a Calabrian laborer , whose rocky flanks all but bruised him , and an Old Testament prophet seeking new omens in the Social Democratic editorials of the Vorwarts , he remained isolated , eyes glued to his text . As he rode and read , he jotted shorthand notes on the back of an old envelope . He left his studies only long enough to change to the Third Avenue El at the Brooklyn Bridge station , resuming his reading now strap-hanging , cradling the book in his right arm , straddling the misshapen brief case , and protecting it from the milling feet around him . His first lecture was in medicine at the Carnegie Laboratory on Twenty-sixth Street . He reached the austere red brick pile about five minutes before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arabesqued door of the lab , but the fishmonger 's son was nowhere in sight . Sam worried about him : Maxie was always just barely passing his courses . If he missed any of the concluding lectures he would be in hotter water than he imagined . And the lecturer that morning was the new dean himself  --  Egbert LeFevre , the one professor whose lectures were considered mandatory . Old Lemkau , himself a Bellevue man , had once advised him , " Cut classes , fail courses and be a bad boy , Sammy . But do n't miss LeFevre . " He waited apprehensively for Maxie , pulling the peaked cap over his ears to close out the icy wind whipping across the street from the East River . At the curb a group of high-class Princeton and Yale boys in derby hats and fur-lined greatcoats , were baiting Otto , the diener in charge of the morgue . A fresh shipment of canvas-wrapped corpses from the City Hospital had arrived . The bleak , swaying wagon , driven by an Irishman with a pulverized scarlet face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fun began . " Oi , oi , fresh fish today ! " " Hey , Otto , your relatives ! " " Look  --  meat on the bones ! " One of them had thrown aside part  | of the stained canvas wrapper . A woman 's arm dropped out , the mortised fingers scraping in the gutter snow . Sam watched them with quiet revulsion . These were the class gentlemen : the kids who smoked Havana cigars and meerschaums . They had dates with girls from Rector 's and the Hippodrome . They never seemed to study , yet they always seemed to scrape through . He did n't mind their carrying on . They left him alone and there were remarkably few unpleasant contacts between the gentlemen and the commuting Jewish boys with their crammed brief cases . But fooling around with the dead ! Making jokes about those corpses ! They had been real people once , people with hopes and desires and emotions . He shuddered . The stiffs never bothered him in the dissecting room , but , seeing the canvas bags stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like so many sacks of cabbages by Otto 's white-smocked attendants , he was drenched with vague misery . Maxie was still not in sight . He greeted Karasik , the little refugee with the pince-nez and the black derby , who was his other close friend , and they walked into the drafty , semicircular lecture hall . LeFevre was not in sight , and , once in the classroom , the gentlemen resumed their gleeful play . They had seized the tan derby of one of their number ; three others in sharp suits and silk waistcoats were tossing it around in a wild game of salugi . Suddenly a white-coated attendant entered , rapping for order with a yardstick . From a side door , Egbert LeFevre entered , his dignity and intelligence demanding immediate silence . LeFevre was in his early fifties . With the death of the legendary Edward G. Janeway that year , LeFevre had become dean . LeFevre 's brown hair was parted neatly in the middle , falling in delicate semicircles over the high forehead ; he had a full fleshy nose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hands gripping the lecturer 's bar which separated the amphitheater from the professor 's little empire of blackboards , slate-topped desk , and laboratory equipment , LeFevre surveyed the class . He endowed his third-year men with a professional intimacy they hardly deserved . " Gentlemen , " he began , " we will put your powers of observation to test this morning . Rather than wear you out with an academic lecture , we will attempt diagnoses with several subjects . Since most of you are now cramming your heads with words for your midyear examinations , I felt it would be politic to let you try your skill as true practitioners and offer you a bit of respite . " The voice was not in keeping with the frock-coated , bearded figure : it was high and nasal , and the last few rows of students were obliged to lean forward to catch the dean 's words . LeFevre gestured  | to the diener , and the man standing at the sliding blackboard pulled back one wall-high panel to reveal a small anterior room . It was like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a platform rising several feet above the classroom level . On three wooden chairs sat the subjects for diagnosis : an elderly man in a baggy workhouse suit ; a bearded young Jew , sitting cross-legged , his distracted eyes roaming over the faces in front of him ; and a girl in her teens , shivering in a black shawl . " Now , gentlemen , take your time observing our subjects , make notes if you wish , and be prepared for questioning . Before we take up each patient , I shall offer you a little clinical history  --  but be assured it will be very little indeed , " LeFevre intoned . There was a clattering noise as the side door of the amphitheater was pushed open . The attendant rose crankily from his seat , shushing the ate-comer . Sam cringed . It was Max Vogel , trying to sneak quietly up the side aisle , trying to hide his roseate face beneath a mangy fur cap . " Late-corners will please remove their hats , " LeFevre said gently . " Mr. Vogel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for laboratory , you will be late for your first delivery , and you will be late on the Judgment Day . " Max maneuvered his ample rear end , straining within shiny blue serge , into the seat adjacent to Sam 's . " Where the devil you been , Maxie ? " Sam whispered . Maxie 's words , delivered from the side of his facile mouth ( his eyes all this time fixed innocently on the lecturer ) , shocked Sam . " I stayed in New York . You know that redheaded assistant in pathology ? The one with the tits that dip into the test tubes when she bends over ? I paid her a visit and slept late . Oi vay ! " Sam looked at him disapprovingly . How could Maxie get away with it ? How did he find the nerve to live that way ? He , Sam , had been engaged to Sarah Malkin for four years  --  ever since the formation of the walking and literary group . They were more than willing to forswear the intimate company of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , advising Sarah he did n't want Louis Kosloff hanging around . She had accepted , and now they were both prepared to wait until he was practicing medicine . Thinking of Sarah , his attention drifted from the three wretches on the little stage . " Vogel , what do you make of this case ? " Maxie stood up . " I will inform you that the subject is a white male , aged fifty-five . A history of alcoholism , undernourishment , and irregular habits . He  | has worked in a nearby tool and die factory , performing arduous manual labor . Recent symptoms : loss of appetite , coughing spells , occasional bringing up of bloody phleghm on rising . " Max suggested consumption , the obvious answer . LeFevre questioned him unmercifully , pricking his confident response with several alternate possibilities , trapping the student with the latter 's own glibness . It was a case of incipient consumption , LeFevre said , but he felt that Vogel had merely made a wild guess . It might have been any one of several ailments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : better to be careful and thorough than to be too quick and sure of yourself . They were discussing the little girl now , a cardiac case ; bluelipped and white-skinned , the transparent flesh like bleached bone . It was a congenital disorder , LeFevre said , and all that could be prescribed was rest , fresh air , and a good diet to build up her resistance . It did not seem like much in the way of therapy to Sam , and suddenly , with a sinking feeling of terror , he felt he was looking at his own wretched family . The ruined little consumptive could have been his father , the little girl with the leached-out , bloodless look of the congenital cardiac could have been Aaron . It distressed him that these people had to be paraded in front of the probing eyes of the students ; what right had those clucks in the derbies and checked coats , puffing their twenty-cent cigars , to look them over like monkeys in a zoo ? LeFevre asked the young bearded Jew to stand up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railing , bowing his head as if flinching from a blow and running a soft white hand over hospitalcropped hair . " Say something , speak , " LeFevre said . The young patient looked innocently at the dean . The gentleness in the professor 's voice made him smile and he seemed happier about the ordeal . LeFevre gestured at his lips , moving his fingers outward to indicate speech . The visionary eyes opened wide with understanding . " Ich bin hungerich , Ich vill essen , Ich vill a schnappsel , " the young man mumbled . " Ich bin hungerich , Ich vill essen , Ich vill a schnappsel . Ich bin hungerich His voice drifted away to a hoarse murmur ; the imbecilic smile remained . LeFevre gave a brief history of the patient , and then elicited from the students an opinion of insanity ; one suggested paresis ; another , imbecility induced by an accident to the nervous system . The patient , who had resumed his seat and was holding his head  | in his hands , was called to the railing again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " LeFevre said . " You will note when I ask him to speak , he will repeat the same meaningless gibberish that he uttered before . His entire range of speech , of articulation , possibly because of severe brain injury , is now restricted to these few words . " " You 'll excuse me , sir , but I think what the subject is saying makes perfect sense , " he said . There was an obscene hoot from the back of the lecture hall . " What makes you say that , Abelman ? " LeFevre asked , smiling . " When a patient who has shown all the symptoms of withdrawal , of inability to communicate , keeps repeating the same set of words , what are we to expect ? " " That 's very true , sir , and I agree , " Sam said . " I just want to point out that the words themselves are n't meaningless . All the man is saying is , I 'm hungry , I want to eat , I want a little whiskey . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voicing sentiments which a lot of us feel from time to time . " " You make an interesting point , Abelman , " LeFevre said . " I agree that my own  --  let us say  --  linguistic limitations prevented me from a complete and accurate reading of the syndrome . But , nonetheless , I think that , when taken in context with other symptoms , we can not help but reach a verdict of insanity . However , there is a lesson in the point you make , Abelman . We must never take anything for granted . Had I been treating this poor soul , and had I failed to call in a person fluent in the language , I would have been guilty of an oversight . Thank you for calling our attention to this . " Sam sat down , flushed with the half victory . Vogel 's elbow nudged his ribs . " Stop stickin ' your two cents in , professor , " he said bitterly . He needed you like a hole in the head . " " Shut up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The termination of the first hour 's lecture was the signal for an outbreak of singing , whistling , and spitball warfare in the rear rows . A heated argument had broken out over the outcome of the last Yale-Princeton basketball game . Cigar smoke floated down to the lower rows . An Ivy League wit was doing a comical imitation of LeFevre , mimicking his nasal singsong , the precise phraseology . Karasik , the voice of cultured Europe , shook his head sadly at Sam . " Such behavior , " he said sadly . " No respect at all for the professor ! Tell me , Abelman , why do they act like apes ? " Sam smiled indulgently . He liked Karasik , the solemn little Austrian with his polished manners , but he could n't be bothered with philosophical discussions during midyear week . He had ten  | minutes between lectures , time enough to get his nose into the surgery textbook . A spitball the size of a lemon whistled between them . Spinning by , it flicked the outer edge of Karasik 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair facing them . Karasik 's Viennese poise was shattered , even though the spectacles were undamaged . He leaned over , a fat little foreigner , very conscious of how different he was from the vigorous Americans , and picked them up daintily , almost ashamed for having invited the humiliation . He was adjusting the pince-nez on his nose when Sam reached down and picked up the wad . " I got a good mind to tell those lice off , " he said to Max Vogel and to Karasik . " Are your specs okay , Franz ? " " Yes , yes , of course . Do n't make any fuss over me . " " Sam , for Christ 's sake , sit down , " said Max contemptuously . " You 're no lousy gym teacher any more . Siddown ! " But Sam was already pushing his way through the crowded rows of overloaded knees , heavy with overcoats , open textbooks , and brief cases , and was trudging up the steps to the rear seats . A basketball , fashioned of someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . Sam vaulted an empty seat , and with the leap of a trained gymnast ( Hector O'Bannion would have approved ) intercepted the makeshift ball . A lean blond student with a gray derby , tilted over languid eyes , blew a cloud of cigar smoke his way . " Do n't tell me ! It 's the poor but honest Horatio Alger , Abelman the Great ! " " Ah , cut the crap , " Sam said . " Which of you guys threw this ? " " What 's it to you , Abelman ? " another one of the rear-seaters asked . He had the prognathous face of a halfback . " I just want to return it , " Sam said . " I guess one of you lost it . " " Look , Sammy , " the cigar smoker said . " What do you take everything so seriously for ? Why get so excited over Karasik ? The little professor does n't care if we rag him . Why should you ? " " Did you throw it , Padgitt ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offended about ? " He was genuinely anxious to appease his outraged classmate . To Padgitt , raised in an atmosphere of fraternity pranks , a spitball was part of the hazards of student life . Sam , a head shorter than the confessed thrower , walked up to him and with deliberate slowness stuffed the soggy paper ball into Padgitt 's waistcoat . " Well , all I wanted to do was return it , " Sam said . He shoved Padgitt gently and then both were surprised to find themselves  | locked together , shoved unwillingly into each other 's grasp by the halfback and two other members of the rear-seat clique . They struggled purposelessly , little Karasik running in a woman 's mincing steps up to the scene to try to arbitrate . A surging crowd was gathering around the contestants as Hermann M. Biggs , professor of public health , entered the room . The austere beaked head with its curled black mustache looked in horror on the battle . His compelling voice , one that had once forced New York City 's politicians to enact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant . " For a group about to enter its crucial midyear examinations , " Biggs said , " such behavior is inadmissible . I find it hard to believe you must be treated like undergraduates . I will save what else I have to say for my office after five o'clock . All of you who participated in this exhibition will meet me there . Fitzpatrick here " ? he indicated the little attendant at his side ? " knows which of you were involved , so do not attempt to deceive me . " A cold gloom settled over Sam Abelman  --  of all things , to be trapped in a disciplinary mess ! He slumped back in his seat , barely hearing Biggs start his lecture on the protection of child health . He jumped when Max grabbed him in the ribs . " What the hell is the matter with you , Sam ? Whose battles are you fighting ? " he whispered . " So what if Karasik 's cheaters got knocked off ? What skin is that off your nose ? And that argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell he did . When he needs a Yiddish interpreter he 'll hire his own ! " Sam said nothing . His despair was complete . Mox Vogel nudged him again . " And if you got ta stay after five to see Biggs , how am I gon na borrow your pathology notes without hanging around ? Do n't you ever think of me ? " They met in Biggs ' office in the main building on First Avenue and Twenty-sixth Street . Padgitt came , and the halfback , and two other rear-seaters . Karasik had insisted to Sam that he come also . In his whining , apologetic Viennese accent he had advised Sam it was all his fault for looking so silly that any normal , healthy American would be perfectly justified in knocking his glasses off . He angered Sam thoroughly , hanging on his overcoat sleeve and trailing along , until they reached the entrance to the red brick building . " Beat it , Franz , " Sam said bitterly , " I did n't start the fight just to help you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study for the pathology exam . "  | " But really , Samuel , if you will only permit me to speak to Professor Biggs ? " " Vamoose ! " Biggs kept them waiting half an hour , all of them fidgeting , crossing and uncrossing their legs in the anteroom . Padgitt once offered him a cigarette ; Sam refused but smiled and thanked him . It was dawning on all of them that the whole battle had been meaningless , unnecessary , and that essentially they were not bad fellows at all . Hermann M. Biggs called them in finally . They stood in a sheepish semicircle around the vast desk , watching Biggs spin away from them in the leather swivel chair . The gesture seemed to imply his own weariness at having to treat with them like delinquent children ; he was a man who dealt in campaigns to stamp out TB , diphtheria , syphilis . Teacher , clinician , administrator , he was probably the most brilliant member of the Bellevue faculty . " Quite candidly , gentlemen , " Biggs began wearily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have always felt that the practice of medicine , whether it involves the bandaging of a sprained ankle or the organization of a state-wide campaign for inoculations , demands a high seriousness ; the kind of seriousness I like to see in our students . I know that the wild behavior in my class today can be attributed to the pressures and tensions of examinations . But that does not make it easier for me to see my students behaving like hoodlums when they should be applying themselves to learning all there is to learn in our complex profession . " They looked curiously at each other , wondering whether Biggs had finished his disciplinary lecture . Once having called them to his office , the great clinician had appeared too preoccupied to chastise them . Biggs sighed . " Do any of you wish to offer any explanation for what happened ? Do some of you feel unfairly treated ? " " Just horseplay , professor , " Padgitt volunteered . He darted a quick glance at Sam ; it had not been horseplay alone , it had started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's all it was , sir , " Sam said quickly . " We were playing basketball and a few of us lost our tempers . " Biggs spun away again . " High seriousness , gentlemen , high seriousness , " he said . " Have your fun at times other than office hours . " He dismissed them with a wave of his hand and as they trooped out , heads properly lowered , Sam heard Biggs calling his name . He halted at the door and turned .  | " Abelman , " Professor Biggs said , " what were you doing in that mess ? " His tone was not unfriendly , and Sam sensed the vague compliment . " Me , sir ? " he asked . " Oh , just a little fun . I guess we got carried away with ourselves . " He wanted nothing of the Karasik matter discussed . It would be difficult  --  almost impossible ? to explain what motives had impelled him to act as the Austrian 's knight errant . " You do n't seem the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marks good , attendance excellent , and , if I may say so , an occasional streak of brilliance in diagnostic work . " He thanked Biggs and left , walking on a misty cloud all the way to the library where he spent an enchanted hour making lastminute notes , inscribing them carefully on a carbon and an extra sheet for Max Vogel who waited for him like a predatory bird outside the library . " Where ya been so long ? " Vogel asked peevishly . " I 'm supposed to stay up all night for four pages of notes ? And that handwriting ! " He had no harsh words for Max ; he was lofted away by Biggs ' brief praise . Jammed inside the rattling Third Avenue Elevated again , the textbook once more cradled in his arm , he only half knew what he was reading . The magic of learning , of maturing , was intoxicating him and the confrontation with Biggs was like an excessive inhalation of aromatic tobacco . After two and one-half years of medical college he had not lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraternity . He loved the books , the heavy , finely printed texts , so loaded with information that they broke away from the dark-red bindings ; the hours in the laboratory , scliiinting into microscopes , probing the luckless corpses ; the sessions in the lecture hall where the great men of medicine came to share their knowledge . And what a group of men ! LeFevre , Biggs , Park , Wyckoff , and of course Harlow Brooks the assistant professor of clinical medicine , the friendly man with the Indian face to whom all students sooner or later brought their problems . Transferring at Brooklyn Bridge to the Fulton Street El , swept along through slush and street dirt by the swarm of immigrants , Sam had a disturbing thought . It seemed to him he was almost too intoxicated with Bellevue , with the professors , the art of learning , to ever feel so strongly about anything in his future work . What if he did hang out a shingle in Brooklyn ? Could anything ever approximate the pure sense of achievement he gained from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Harlow Brooks ? Or even the little speech Hermann Biggs had made to him ? Prac-  | Lice would mean Brownsville again , long , hard hours of work , in the mushrooming slum , a struggle for the first few years and maybe longer . Bellevue meant an association with the men who were revolutionizing the concepts of medicine in the United States . It was after eight at night when he reached home . Dr. Lemkau 's black Franklin was parked in front of the tenement . Innate pessimism propelled Sam up the stoop and the sloping stairs , through the odor of tired cooking and sodden garbage , into their apartment . He had a sense for disaster : Lemkau was seated at the kitchen table , scribbling on a prescription pad . The pince-nez were perched elegantly on the tip of his nose , jiggling in cadence with each jerk of the pen . Aaron , as pale as the faded white enamel of the kitchen sink , was standing at his side . His mother was hunched over in a kitchen chair , crying softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aaron said . " He collapsed at the place this afternoon and they wanted to call for an ambulance , but he would n't let them . He was afraid it would cost too much money . So the crazy nut had to come all the way home on the streetcar . How he walked from Ralph Avenue to here , I do n't know . " Sam was horrified , his own guilt jabbing at him . Abelman the tailor had collapsed and refused to have an ambulance take him to his home because it would cost too much ; and each day he gave his son fifty cents to see him through one more step toward being a doctor . " What 's wrong , Dr. Lemkau ? Is it serious ? " Sam asked . His mother wailed , raising shriveled arms , the wrinkles on her face multiplying as she grimaced . Sam looked at her with annoyance and Aaron cautioned her to control herself . That was the trouble with old country Jews  --  they went around parading their sorrows publicly , breast beating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck was directed against them personally by that stern and indifferent God who had been demanding excessive tribute from them for so long . Sam was glad to see Aaron was calm and self-controlled ; he was thankful the boy had been around when his father came staggering home . " It looks like a case of la grippe , nothing worse , I trust , " Lemkau said . Ile had a rolling baritone voice , tinged with enough of a Russian accent to make him sound authoritative without being a greenhorn . " He was running a high temperature , one hundred and four , but , with aspirin and alcohol baths , it should come down overnight . " " How about his heart and lungs ? " Sam asked quickly .  | Lemkau 's eyes appeared to smile indulgently , but he was not overjoyed with the medical student 's query . " You sound like LeFevre already , Sammy , asking questions like that , " he said . " All right , professor . The heartbeat is normal , the pulse a little faint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't seem congested . I wish he had n't traveled all the way home like that . These cases where the patient refuses good advice ? " " Papa came home to save money , " Aaron said bitterly . " These old-timers save a dollar and take their lives in their hands . " Lemkau stood up , handing the fly-tracked prescription to Sam , noting with distaste the way the young man scrutinized the specific , as if putting his approval on it . " Sedative ? " Sam asked . " What did you expect , roast goose ? " Lemkau asked loftily . " The aspirin every three hours , the sedative only when he wakes up , and an alcohol bath every three hours until the temperature goes down . " Aaron was helping him into his greatcoat , straightening the bearskin collar . " I do n't think it will be necessary to call me , " the doctor said . " By morning he should be looking better . The fee is two dollars , please . " Other doctors charged a dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for two , and not only got it but was in the greatest demand . A vague feeling that the pince-nez , the fur collar , the swallowtail coat , and the rich baritone voice had as much to do with his popularity as his clinical knowledge fleeted through Sam 's mind . He went to the bedroom , glancing at the shrunken figure of his father , breathing heavily beneath the drab blankets , and found two soiled bills in the thin wad of household money his mother kept in the dresser drawer . Lemkau tucked the money into a vest pocket , assured them that everything would turn out well , and left . His departure brought on another seizure of wails from Sam 's mother , and both he and Aaron pleaded with her to be still . " Ma , that hollering is n't going to help papa get better , " Aaron said . " Go sleep in my bed . Sam and I will look after him tonight . Go on . " " Oi gevald , he 'll die ! " she shrieked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ah , ma , he 'll be all right , " Aaron said placatingly . He led her to the second bedroom , comforting her . He was her baby , Sam thought , sickly , spoiled , favored ; yet he had a tough fiber inside him that made him more of a prop to his helpless parents than they were to him . Sam was unpacking books on the kitchen table , brewing some  | tea , and preparing himself for a night of study . Aaron returning from the bedroom , shoved him away from the gas stove . " Sit down and study , professor , " the younger brother said solicitously . " I 'll brew you up an Abelman special . " " Okay , Hackenschmidt , " Sam said . " You 're getting muscles like a wrestler , working at that shop . I think I 'll get Hector O'Bannion to give you a scholarship if you keep it up . " " I should live on carrots and lettuce like you did ? Nuts . I 'll be eating steaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was past nine . He was two hours behind his normal study schedule , and he had to complete his review of a half year 's work in pathology . What with tending to his father it would be a rugged night . But the challenge only made him more determined to absorb every shred of information he could , to conquer the endless words , sentences , paragraphs of complicated information , to prove to Biggs , to LeFevre , to Brooks , that he had the talent for the work . He bent to his books , again scribbling notations on scraps of paper : abbreviations , interspersed with neat , accurate drawings . At midnight he heard his father stirring . It was time for the sedative , the aspirin , and the alcohol bath anyway . He tiptoed in , letting the dim kitchen light filter through . In the yellow gloom the tailor looked appalling weak and drained . " Papa , you awake ? " he asked . " I 'm not sleeping , so I 'm awake . " His voice was thick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my heart . " " It 's not your heart , papa , you 've got grippe  --  a bad cold . " It was always the heart with the old people when they were ill . There must have been something in Mosaic Law or in some paragraph of the Torah that convinced all of them their heart was going when they took sick . He propped the old man up in bed , rolled up the soiled undershirt and repressed a rush of pity at the sight of the caved chest . Modesty forbade them looking at each other 's bodies ; he had forgotten how thin and weak his father was . " Take it easy , papa , the great Professor Abelman is examining you . " He proceeded with the stethoscope , using the worn instrument Sarah had bought for him in a Third Avenue pawnshop , looking for the clear sounds of health . Either Lemkau was inefficient , or the old man had developed new symptoms in the past three hours . There was , to Sam 's ear , a distinct congestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , convinced he was right . But Lemkau had assured him it was just la grippe ; maybe he was imagining it . He sponged the shrunken limbs , feeling the temperature of the shriveled skin change as the cooling liquid was daubed on .  | " Go back to sleep , papa , " he said . The old man 's voice was so faint he wondered if he had heard him properly . " You 'll have to stop going to school , " he thought he heard him murmur , " it costs too much . " Sam left him , returning to his texts . This time he found it harder to concentrate ; the tailor 's mumbled admonition upset him . He knew what his father was thinking about  --  if he died or became incapable of working how would they get along ? In addition to the fifty cents per diem Sam received , he also got his breakfast and evening meal , as well as his lodging and an occasional piece of wearing apparel . If the income from the tailoring shop ended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the examination came first . At four , he stopped reading and , removing his shoes , tried to doze on the sagging , discolored living room sofa . He had been there no more than fifteen minutes when a rattling , rhythmic noise made him start . Softly , so as not to awaken his mother ( all he needed was some more of her screaming ) , he roused Aaron . They tiptoed into the old man 's sickroom . The tailor was sprawled , arms wide , in a stupor ; the room smelled of tired sweat , as if he had carried the defeated steamy odors of the shop into his bed and saturated sheet and blanket with them . His mouth was wide apart and he was gulping and exhaling air in what appeared to be a supreme unconscious effort to pump life into his body . " Oh , my God , " Sam shuddered . " It 's his death rattle . Papa 's on the way out . " " He ca n't be , " Aaron whispered . " Lemkau said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt something in his chest . Aaron , you better run get him . Call from the candy store . " " Candy store ? There 's nothing open now . " " Then you 'll have to walk over . I 'll go if you do n't feel strong enough . " " No , you stay . I 'll go now . " It took an hour before Aaron returned with the irate physician . Victor Lemkau did not appreciate middle-of-the-night calls . Only the arrogant persistence of the younger brother had brought him out of bed , grumbling and cursing the profession . He had no sooner entered the apartment than , to Sam 's great relief ( and embarrassment ) , the old man 's breathing improved . The rattling noise abated , and his heartbeat and pulse sounded almost normal . " For this you woke me up ? " Lemkau asked angrily . " For a slight change in breathing ? Sammy , what kind of a diagnostician are you ? " " It sounded like a death rattle , " Sam said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't necessarily mean death is imminent . " " I also listened to his chest , " Sam said apologetically . " He seems to have developed something since you examined him . " " Well , an Osier already we have , " Lernkau said . " What diagnosis , if you please ? " " Look , Dr. Lemkau , I 'm not trying to be a weisenheimer . I know you know more than I do . I said he probably developed the symptom after you examined him . Could you please listen again ? " Lemkau walked to the bedside and re-examined the tailor 's chest . He made a noncommittal gesture with his hands and pursed his lips . " A little bit , a little bit , " he said . " It 's to be expected in these old garment workers . Nothing out of the ordinary . Call me in the morning if the temperature stays up . " The fee this time was three dollars , for a night call , and the dwindling roll of household money perturbed Sam momentarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning about his having to leave school . Fortunately , the clock prevented any brooding over it . It was six now  --  and , after a half hour 's sleep , he would be on his way to Bellevue again for two examinations . In the morning , he had three hours of special pathology ; in the afternoon three hours of principles and practices of medicine . But for Sam Abelman , the allotted time did not seem nearly adequate to write down all he knew . He assaulted the written examinations as if they were his old enemies , the galoots , searching his well-arranged mind of every relevant fact , tying them together in clear and meaningful paragraphs . At lunch with Max Vogel after the pathology examination , he gulped three scalding cups of black coffee , feeling the stimulant perk his brain , confident he could not be beaten . After all , he owed a good performance to Brooks and Biggs and LeFevre ; a man could n't let them down . He was unsympathetic with Max 's whining complaints about the rigorous problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A goddam good thing I had your notes , " Vogel said . " I bet Winters had a hand in that one . All that crap about atrophied muscles ! I 'll atrophy him some day . " " Did you pass , Maxie ? " Sam asked . He cradled the hot coffee mug . " You bet your sweet ass I did , " Maxie said slyly . He looked about him furtively , content that no one in the Physical Culture Restaurant was listening . " Get a load of these . " He turned up the inner side of  | his belt , revealing two cards , filled with minute lettering , sewed to the raw leather . " I stayed up most of last night getting this rig finished . The whole pathology megillah on two cards ! " " Are you out of your mind , Max ? What if you get caught ? " Vogel seized Sam 's unfinished bowl of bean soup and drained it greedily . " They do n't catch guys like me , Sammy . I was born to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work for ' em . " His round , red face looked about again for any listeners , and then he took from his coat pocket a second belt , similarly festooned on its inner surface . " I got ' em for medicine , too , " he said . " No one screws around with Maxie Vogel . " Sam needed no such mnemonic aid for the second examination . Twenty minutes before the examination period was over he handed in his paper , waved to the sweating Maxie and to little Karasik , and left for Brooklyn . Fatigue began asserting itself on the elevated . When he debarked at Saratoga Avenue he thought he would be incapable of making the fifteen-minute walk to his home . A numbing weakness had seized his limbs , his iron chest . Enervation combined with a sudden sense of guilt . He had barely thought of his ailing father throughout the headlong rush of the day . His mind has been laden with the symptoms , syndromes , therapies , and diagnoses of abstract patients who existed only in heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never entered the ideal medical world of his examination booklets . He wondered again what could be the matter with the old man . Lemkau was probably right  --  it was la grippe , the usual winter infection so common in the slums . It would knock the old man out for a week or so , and then he 'd be back in the place , bent over his machine , his stooped body obscured in the steamy clouds of the presser . In the midwinter dusk he saw a small , group of people gathered at the stoop of the house . He recognized two of his father 's distant cousins , members of the same lodge , and then he saw Sol Pomerantz walking toward him . " Sam , Sam , listen to me . Do n't get hysterical and do n't collapse , " Sol began . His own eyes were red and swollen . " Your father died a few hours ago . " Sam stopped . The brief case fell from his grip and he put a hand to his forehead , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Die ? " he groaned , " Oh , God , Solly ! How ? What ? Was Lemkau  | here ? " He could not weep ; he had become a stranger to his father . In the old man 's last hours he had served him more as a clinician than a son . " Lemkau left a little while ago . He got here after your father died . Ile said it was his heart , it gave out suddenly . He said he might have lived if he had n't taken that crazy trip back to Brooklyn and gone to a hospital when he collapsed yesterday . " " Oh , God , " Sam repeated , " my mother  --  Aaron  --  what happens now ? " " Your mother is taking it pretty good , " Sol said , " and Aaron ? the kid is great . " He missed completely Sam 's implication : what worried him was their financial future , including his own . Tormented by his own selfishness in the face of his father 's death , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had ahead of him . In the apartment , candles flickered in the winter gloom . He heard the muddled chanting of mourners : some of his father 's chums from the synagogue were there , standing around the coffin , mounted on trestles in the narrow living room . His father , an Orthodox Jew , would be spared evisceration and the other arts of the mortician . He wore a skullcap , a new white prayer shawl , and held a prayer book in his broken hands . Nodding and bobbing , the old words flowing from beard-muffled mouths , the elders interceded with God on behalf of Reb Yankele Abelman , the tailor from Brovo and part-time Talmudic scholar . Sam noticed the mirrors in the house had been covered  --  a custom brought over from the old country . Aaron led him to the wooden box . in death , his father looked barely different than when he was alive . " How did it happen , kiddo ? " Sam asked . " he started moaning about one o'clock . I just gave him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place today , and he was sipping it , saying he felt pretty good . He started that heavy breathing again . I called Lemkau , but Papa was dead before he got here . " " How did you know ? " The mourners eyed them sorrowfully , the two apostate sons , shorn and English-speaking , discussing their father 's last hours on earth in tearless voices , ignoring the holy chants . " I held my shaving mirror up to his mouth and I saw he was n't breathing . So I called Karnofsky the undertaker . " " Where 's Mama ? " Aaron indicated their own bedroom . " She 's in there with Moishe  | and Rivke . Hysterical ! What can we expect ? You should go in and comfort her . " Sam walked dutifully to the bedroom , to the conglomerate wails and shrieks . His mother was prostrate on his bed , sobbing in great , convulsive gasps . Rivke was crying in agitated sniffles . Moishe was Moishe  --  he crouched dumbly in the corner , muttering prayers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to comfort them . But was he supposed to be the only one who was strong , who stood up under pressure ? He sat down beside his mother , hugging the bony frame , feeling the coarse texture of the black shawl she always wore . He spoke in Yiddish , finding the words coming easily . " Do n't cry , mama , Papa was very sick . He never could have worked any more even if he had lived . He was a good , kind man and everyone will remember him that way . When you lead a good life , mama , a little bit of that life always remains in the world for people to think about and love . Mama , please stop crying ! Do n't cry ! " His speech , aimed at comforting them , only invoked new spasms of tears . His mother clutched at him , streaking his face with tears . In the half light of the living room Aaron was sitting at the window , staring into the darkening slum street . A single ancient of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in respectful and self-sufficient silence . He was of a piece : skullcap , talks , prayer book  --  all that he needed to sustain him in this world and the next and any other worlds he might be thrust into . Sam was almost a little jealous of him . " Who 's he ? " he asked Aaron . His brother 's invalid face was redeyed and deeply enshadowed ; yet the boy was as calm as a neurosurgeon . " He 's the one who stays up all night with the deceased and prays . " " Who appointed him ? " Sam asked with some peevishness . " Do you want him hanging around all night ? " " Ah , come on , Sam . Papa would have wanted him . It 's one of the old rules . He ca n't hurt anyone . " The patriarch turned a white-ruffed , cross-hatched face toward the brothers . He understood more English than they imagined . " Boychiklech , you would n't pray with me ? " he asked . " I prayed already , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor ? " he asked Sam . " Zayde , I am a scientist , a professor , as you said . We 're a bunch of bad fellows , we do n't pray very often . "  | The old man nodded disapprovingly , clacking false teeth . " The Torah is a better teacher than the college , boychick . " Sam picked up his overcoat and cap . He felt he had done his duty  --  what more did they expect of him ? They would demand that he sit Shiva , stay in the house for one week for a period of mourning , acting as host to the scores of relatives and friends who would visit with gifts of fruit , candy , wine  --  sweets to sweeten the bitterness of death . He would refuse , of course , because of the examinations ( he would have refused in any case ) , and there would be another shrieking scene . " Where are you going , Sam ? " Aaron asked . " I 'm going to see Sarah , " he said hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Sam ! You should be here ! Mama needs you  --  and you have to study tonight ! When will you sleep ? When will you eat ? " " I 'll manage . " He was out the door already , leaving behind the dull hum of tragedy  --  the muted cries from the bedroom , the low rumble of the mourner at the coffin . Alone in the street , his tears were unloosed . He had been cold , indifferent in the face of his father 's death , the detached medical man offering flat , comforting words and trying to keep his head . Sobbing now as he walked toward the trolley , he realized , with deep shame , that his behavior had stemmed from something more selfish , more personal , than the desire to soothe his family . His father 's death had plunged him into crisis : at the back of his mind had been the appalling prospect that his education was at an end . They were almost penniless . Aaron would have to help support the old lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to work ? There remained a year and a half of medical schooling to be paid for . He burst into Sarah 's kitchen as the Malkin family was having its evening meal . Malkin pere had just finished his nightly upbraiding of Sarah 's younger brother , Willie . Willie had opted against serving under his father 's iron hand in the grocery jobbing business . Instead he had gone to work in a Pitkin Avenue clothing store , assuring unwilling customers that " it fits perfect . " Between the tyrannical father and the rebellious son there was perpetual border warfare . They sniped from behind preconceived notions , set up small verbal ambushes , and peppered each other with interminable insults . Through it all , Sarah and her mother , a small woman of remarkable dignity who wore a wig on her shaven pate , would sit quietly and await the few peaceful moments when the warring parties would catch their breath . " Pop , when are you gon na wise up ? " Willie would ask , ladling  | chicken soup dotted with thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think the big guys are gon na let you sell your tea and coffee a cent higher than them ? " " Look , it talks yet ! Advice from a prosteh yid ! From a salesman who sells suits they fall apart after you wear them once ! " He looked up seeing Sam standing in the hallway . " Oh , halloi , Abelman ! Nu , how is the professor ? " " I have some sad news , " Sam said . " My father died today ! " " Oi , a shame , " Malkin said . Mrs. Malkin and Willie made appropriate condolences . Sarah rose and came to Sam 's side . Her father murmured a prayer and expressed his admiration for the departed tailor , who , though he worked with his hands , found time to study once a week . " Oh , Sam , I 'm so sorry , " Sarah said . " How did it happen ? Was it sudden ? " " He came home sick from work yesterday . His heart gave out this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happened . " He discerned a cold look of disapprobation in Malkin 's merciless eye . " Mr. Malkin , I 'd like to take Sarah for a walk . We wo n't be gone long . " " " A walk ? Your father 's dead and you 're walking with girls , yet ? She 's in the middle of dinner ! " Sarah rarely disobeyed the old man . But she understood Sam 's urgent need . They hurried down the tenement stairs into the bleak January night . They walked  --  for hours it seemed  --  and Sam cried softly for a while . " It 's a terrible thing to say , kiddo , " he told Sarah , " but now that Papa is dead I feel more sorry for the way he was alive than the fact that he 's gone . What a waste his life was ! Making other people 's coats , pressing and repairing them for thirty-five years ! What did he ever get out of anything ? What kind of pleasures did he have ? " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buddies at the shul , and his family . " " Some family . The sick and the tired . And me , the big boy who could n't pay his way through medical school . " They locked arms and she squeezed his hand . " What are you going to do now , Sam ? " He stopped and withdrew his hand as she moved ahead a step . " I 'm going to quit , that 's what has to happen ! Now I know why I was so  --  so  --  indifferent when Solly told me Papa had died . I was feeling sorry for myself . He played a dirty trick on me , dying like that . He had no right to run out on me . Me , the only one  | in the family with any guts , with any ambition . What else did he have to live for except to help me ? " " Sam , bite your tongue ! " She was genuinely angry . " You talk about courage ! Think of what it took for your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they did ! How do you know what went on in his mind ? He was more proud of you than anything . Do n't you think that fifty cents a day and all the meals you never paid for was a strain for him ? " " He never told me that . " He was rather enjoying the opportunity to feel sorry for himself . " When did you ever talk to him ? When did you try to know him ? " " Ah , what was to talk about ? All he knew  --  his needles and the new Singer and the shul with the old guys with the spinach on their face . " " Sam , you sound awful . I 'm a little ashamed of you . " " And I 'm fed up with everything . Okay , no medical school . I can get back in the school system , get an appointment . I 'll call McDevitt tomorrow . " She drew back a few paces . Under the street light he could see the blush of anger in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do that , Sam , and you can stop calling on me . You can forget about our engagement and everything else . You know what you said three years ago  --  you could n't go on being a teacher , a melamed , instructing a bunch of wild kids in calisthenics . You wanted something better , something more useful to the world . Well , you get nothing for nothing , Sam . And if you wo n't work to become a doctor , you do n't deserve it . " " You tell me how , " he whined . " I should work at night and weekends and never be able to study ? What kind of job can I get ? " " That 's your business . You do n't seem to have thought much of your father , but at least he raised a family and gave you a start . Call your friends . What about Mr. Comerford ? " " I have n't seen him in years . He 's bedridden anyway . " " Well , ask Hector O'Bannion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking like a sick calf . And do n't come calling on me until you know you 're going to finish Bellevue . " She left him ; the first time in their four years of friendship she had done so . It was easy enough for her to be so brave , he thought . She did n't know what it meant , trying to learn medicine and earn a living at the same time . And who would support his mother now ? He might earn his subsistence , he might scratch together enough for tuition and books . But Slonimsky the landlord was not noted for charity .  | Yet somehow he managed . They moved from Slonimsky 's fourroom apartment to a two-room basement flat , sharing a communal toilet with several other families . Sam made a deal with Aaron : the younger brother would manage the rent and the food for a year and a half , until Sam had graduated . They would keep a careful record of what Aaron spent , and as soon as Sam began practicing he would begin paying off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , he needed cash for tuition , books , and his daily expenses . It was a bad time to look for work  --  particularly part-time employment . He tried a few agencies , hating the hat-inhand business of filling out endless forms and waiting behind the wooden railing where the smug agency people sat , calling names out like bailiffs summoning prisoners to the bar . With some uneasiness he turned to his old mentor , O'Bannion . The physical culturist had never forgiven his ex-pupil for forsaking the simple truths of raw carrots and handstands for the mumbo-jumbo of the " dispensers of false remedies . " " My boy , " O'Bannion piped through his red mustache , " I act in your behalf against my better judgment . You showed great promise once  --  a man born to the crusade for good health through diet and muscle vibrations . Instead , you deserted me for the charlatans , the bone-breakers and flesh-cutters , the dolts who misrepresent nature and try to deform her , instead of co-operating with her in endowing suffering mankind with health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the aspirin in Bellevue . " But O'Bannion delivered a job . He had former students in every gymnasium in the city . There was a small athletic club in the financial district which was owned and operated by a Chelsea College graduate . Sam was hired as a semi-instructor and locker boy  --  mopping floors , supplying towels , assisting the masseur , leading the flabby businessmen in calisthenics or pounding a medicine ball into their mushy paunches. lie worked four nights , Monday through Thursday , earning a little extra in the way of tips by coming in Saturdays and Sundays to give special exercises to the club regulars . It paid enough to defray his daily expenses and left a little to store away for tuition . But he could tell in advance that he would need additional cash before the year ended . Charlie McDevitt had promised him a summer playground job again , and he hoped to make up the difference by returning to his beloved galoots . He prayed it would be for the last time  --  the problem of keeping up his studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Toward the end of his third year , when the lengthening days  | deceived him into thinking he could stay up longer , read more , absorb more , he began to notice that his strength was giving out . He felt he could barely make it through final examinations . Desperately lie recalled the way he used to face up to an exam . He had been like a conditioned boxer , an athlete with inherent skills of strength and speed , looking upon each contest with calm confidence . He had enjoyed the tense challenge of the test : the sealed envelopes , the barbed queries , and he had plunged into his answers with a sense of wild joy . Now , he knew , examinations would be a struggle . He never began his studies before eleven o'clock at night , blinking into the unfriendly texts over his evening bowl of soup . Appreciation of what his beaten father had done for him dawned on him slowly ; he would never be able to tell the tailor what his aid had meant . Guilt deepened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books . Concentration was harder ; he had to read and reread , fight against dozing off . In May , two weeks before examinations , Dr. Winter began his spring series of quizzes , aimed at reviewing the year 's work . It was exactly the kind of hard refresher work Sam needed ; but his mopand-medicine-ball duties at the club made it impossible for him to attend . The sessions were of a practical nature , conducted in the Carnegie Laboratory . Sam , coattails flying , would leave the gym and reach the lab a few minutes after Winter 's class adjourned . Usually he found one or two students who remained behind . If he was lucky enough , he borrowed their notes or pleaded with them to furnish him a quick verbal resume of Winter 's demonstration . The Thursday prior to examination week , a prematurely hot May night , he flew into the laboratory , his hopes shattering as he saw the empty room . Only Otto , the chief morgue attendant , was present , muttering his litany against students , professors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an immense Negro , gleaming blue-black under the ceiling lamp , lay on the dissecting table . Apparently the students had been performing an exploratory of the abdomen . The incision was still stretched open by clamps ; Otto was in the process of dismantling the apparatus and stowing away his silent companion . " Otto ! " Sam called out . " Hold it ! Give me a few minutes ! " The sour face , a roadmap of blue-red veins , looked at him contemptuously . " You again . Come on time , or to heck mit you . Dis vun to sleep has to go . Beat it ! " " Otto , please ! Just this once ! ' What was Winter discussing ? " " Who am I ? Professor Biggs ? Vat does it look like , a fractured leg ? "  | " Please , Otto , let me just look it over for an hour or so ! " " You crazy or somethin ' , Abelman ? Vy you such a pest ? " " Look , Otto , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , I promise you , after exams I 'll get you a bottle of schnapps . " Greed conquered churlishness . Otto gave him the keys and left him with the drained corpse . Sam tore off his jacket , rolled up his sleeves , and started to attempt a reconstruction of Winter 's demonstration . There was a convulsion of some kind in the lower bowel that had been exposed for particular attention . He reached for scalpel and scissors and went to work . He had no idea at what point he had fallen asleep , or how from a standing position over the dissecting table he had ended up flat on his back on the wooden floor , in the drugged stupor of total exhaustion . Just as it had been Otto , who had left him there the night before , so now it was the attendant , rousing him with a tirade of profane German . Sam raised himself on elbows , shaking his head . The stink of formaldehyde and the polite rotting of the corpse made him gag . " Abelman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your void ! You would close up for me and clean up ! " " I 'm sorry , Otto , " he muttered . " I guess I fell asleep . I 'll clean up right now . " " Right now ! Right now ! Mit a class to begin in fifteen minutes ! You see what I mean , Professor Brooks ? Dese New York fellahs ? " Harlow Brooks was standing with the morgue attendant . The assistant professor of clinical medicine studied Sam quizzically behind rimless glasses . Sam scrambled to his feet . He had no time to be furious with Otto . He was brimming with shame . " What happened , Abelman ? Volunteering your brain and body for the future of medical research ? " " They wo n't get much out of my brain , Dr. Brooks , " Sam said . " Can I resign now ? " " Any time you want . " Brooks turned to leave , but a slight hesitancy in his walk , some faint beckoning prompted Sam to pursue him . " Could I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Of course , Abelman . But first give Otto a hand . " He grabbed mop and pail ( he was an expert at it after his labors in the athletic club ) , sponged the table clean with disinfectant , helped the custodian return the remains of the corpse to the meat locker . Brooks was waiting for him , his trim figure like the sachem of a  | tribe behind his desk . The walls were covered with Indian masks and artifacts . Sam stared at them curiously , forgetting his distress for the moment . " Go on and ask it , Abelman , is it true that I 'm part Indian ? " He saw Sam 's embarrassed smile and continued , " I 'm not , if it sets your mind at ease . I guess it started because I was born in Mankato , Indian territory . It 's a funny thing how fact fashions itself after fiction . People kept saying I was an Indian , although , I 'm no more a redskin than you . Eventually I became interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people expected of me . " Sam scratched at his unshaven face . He felt dirty and unkempt , unfit for the dignified precincts of Brooks 's office with its library , its grotesque reminders of the nation 's original inhabitants . " What 's eating you , Abelman ? " Brooks asked . He sucked an unlit pipe . " I 'm no good , " Sam blurted out . " I 'll never make it . You know what happened to my marks . " " I 've noticed . You turned in a pretty miserable paper to me last week . " Sam lowered his head as if ducking a punch . " Ca n't take a little punishment , Abelman ? Working nights will be the death of you , I guess . Seems a shame with a year to go . " " I have only so much strength , " Sam said . " If I ca n't do well at something I wo n't do it at all . Look , Professor Brooks , when I studied shorthand I wanted to be the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I graduated at the top of my class in Chelsea College and I ran the best playground in New York City for two summers . " Brooks stoked the pipe , lit it , and puffed . " That 's the trouble with perfectionists . One setback , one change of circumstance that forces a lowering of performance , and you fold up . Abelman , I do n't go around preaching , even though people get the idea I 'm some kind of an oracle and they keep trooping in here for advice . Heap big chief or something like that . But if there 's anything a good doctor needs it 's staying power . Sure , the fellow with the occasional stroke of brilliance is needed . But it 's the day-in , day-out practitioner , the M. D. who is n't sure he knows all the answers , the one who knows he 'll make mistakes now and then , who keeps the profession going . " " If you know how tired I was all the time . Work nights , study into the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick with it or I 'll send you in to the dean now and you can resign . But after almost three years ... " He turned away for a moment , gazing at a magnificent Mandan  | war mask mounted over the doorway . " Reminds me of some of my Park Avenue clientele , " Brooks said , smiling . " Acute dyspepsia brought on by excessive indulgence in rich food . Let me tell you a little story , Abelman , before you go to see Dean LeFevre . " Sam , half rising , resumed his seat . " Some years ago I had a seventy-year-old maiden lady as a patient . Since her sixteenth birthday she had suffered from paroxysmal tachycardia . Know what I 'm talking about ? " Nodding , Sam replied , " Distressing heart spells , with rapid beating making it difficult to count pulse . " " I could n't do a darn thing for her when she got these spells . But the old hen had invented her own therapy . She would lock her thumbs behind her head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believe it or not , made her heart behave normally . I did n't believe her until I saw her perform for me when she suffered a spell . Last year , the lady had an attack of pneumonia , and while in the hospital she was seized by one of these characteristic paroxysms . I got an urgent call from the hospital in the middle of the night  --  seems the old bird was raising Cain and screaming for me . Well I got to the bedside , and there she was , standing in the middle of the floor going through her crazy calisthenics  --  thumbs behind neck , bending to the floor ! The intemes and nurses thought she was insane , of course , but in a few minutes she was all smiles , happy , content , free of her tachycardia , and back in bed , anxious to recover and be out and about again . " Sam was doubly puzzled  --  first as to the purpose of the story , and secondly as to the medical explanation of the patient 's therapy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend it for other patients with a similar ailment ? " Sam asked . " I have n't the faintest idea what it did for her , Abelman , not the remotest . I thought about it a lot and then gave up . " He set the pipe down in an ashtray  --  a Navaho bowl with geometric designs running around the base . " You look as if you 're expecting a moral . Well , there is n't any . Just that there 's so much beyond our understanding , so much that eludes us all the time and must continue to . " " Are you asking me to stay on , Professor Brooks ? " " I 'm not asking you to do a darn thing , Abelman . You know your own mind . What were you going to do after graduation ? " " General practice . " Brooks nodded . " The best kind . We 'll have specialists for the right and left toe if we keep on . Medicine is n't drugs and surgery and therapy . Medicine is people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worthy of some kind of special attention . That  | old lady with her calisthenics , for example . I can sometimes make a better diagnosis from a painting hanging on a man 's bedroom wall than I can from the beat of his heart . After all , that painting is as much an expression of the individual as his heart . " Shamefaced , Sam stood up . He knew he could never quit . He might collapse from lack of sleep , his grades might plummet him into the bottom quartile of the class , he might be the biggest dunderhead in Bellevue 's history , but he knew he could not give up . " One more thing , Abelman . Every year I live it seems to me there are less and less useful things to do in the world . Everything seems to be getting pallid , conformed , stereotyped , people as alike each other as one epithelial cell to another . Medicine is one of the few places where nothing you do is ever a waste , a drain , a bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village all your life , Abelman , and each day will present a new prospect , new things to learn , new gifts to impart to people . It 's the difference between being a spectator and a participant . If you want to be on the outside , looking through the window , go up to LeFevre and resign . But if you want to get your hands into the mess we 're in , for better or worse , stay with us . I do n't care if you end up with the worst set of grades in the Class of 1912 . You 'll learn more and do more in one year of general practice in Brooklyn than in five years of postgraduate work . That 's the trouble with all you vagotonics  --  pessimism and perfection in equal doses . Too much vagus nerve . " They shook hands , student and teacher , and Sam left . He was amazed how soundly he had slept next to the corpse in the dissecting room . A nine o'clock class in gynecology beckoned and he felt remarkably fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his notes for Maxie  --  something he had n't done in weeks . The doctor was stooping low in the cornfield . The last ears of the season were ready for harvesting , and , on the completion of his reminiscences about Bellevue , he had retired to the tassel-topped enclosure , seeking out the remaining crops of his minuscule farm . Outside the makeshift gate , Diane leaped and pranced . She was never allowed in the sancrosanct farmland , yet she never tired of appealing for entree . Under the trees , Thrasher and Daw talked excitedly about the role they would assign to Harlow Brooks in the television program . They knew , of course , Brooks had died many years before , but to Daw 's way of thinking that made it even better . " How about this , " Daw was saying , " we have an overhead shot of the doctor at the desk , maybe with Lord sitting where the  | patient normally sits . Dimly , in the background , we see a glimpse of the Brooks photograph , enough to pique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was the greatest influence in his life , he begins to talk about Brooks . Camera dollies in slowly , focusing on the Brooks photo , and then we roll some tape of Brooks ? there may be a broadcast or a speech of his recorded somewhere . If not , we get a guy with a kindly doctor-type voice to read some of Brooks 's ideas . " " I 'm not sure I like the actor angle , " Thrasher said , rising from the cruel slats . " And I doubt if there are any recordings of his voice . " He called into the cornfield , " Dr. Abelman , when did Harlow Brooks die ? " " Bum ! Got you ! " Dr. Abelman looked up from his labors in the postage-stamp farm . " Not you , Mr. Thrasher . It was a lousy cornborer . I hate the bastards . What did you ask me ? " " When did Harlow Brooks die ? " " Oh , around 1936 . Very sad . He died of a liver abscess . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigated forty years earlier . They called him the beloved physician . ' Usually when a doctor gets a handle like that you can bet he 's a crap artist . But not Brooks . He was a real man . " " Even I liked him , " Max Vogel ventured generously . The doctor had an armload of corn . They looked thin and delicately green , smaller than the supermarket ears , but Dr. Abelman assured his guests they were sweet and juicy beyond a gourmet 's dreams . He unloaded four or five ears on Daw and Thrasher , then , turning empty-handed to Max , tossed a small object at him . " And that 's for you Maxie ! " " Ah , you louse ! " Vogel shrieked . He pawed frantically at the huge , malevolent insect on his starched shirt front , almost tumbling from the hazardous beach chair . " Some joke ! " " What 's the matter , Maxie , afraid he 'll make poo-poo on the twelve-dollar shirt ? " It was not quite , jealousy of Vogel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; just a little resentment against his colleague 's complete control over his patients , his life , his own person . " Max , I want you to look at those head plates again . " The doctor was moving toward the house . " Dr. Abelman , " Daw asked , " anything else about Bellevue we should know ? Are any of those people you mentioned still around ? " " Anything else about Bellevue ? Well , I graduated . That last year almost killed me , but I got out . Got married six months after gradua-  | tion and bought a Dodge from Bishop , McCormick and Bishop . ' " How about people like LeFevre , doctor ? " Daw persisted . " Sonny boy , they 're all dead and gone . LeFevre died in 1914 , what a loss ! Biggs , Carlisle , Brooks , Park  --  all of them . Most of my classmates , like this clunk , are around . Karasik is a practicing neurologist and I send him work . Padgitt , the guy I had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always liked sniffing around . " He was tiring of the interrogation , anxious to get back to his plates , to the urgent problem of Herman Quincy , his headaches and his mysterious convulsions . " What do you know about heroin addiction , Max ? Can it cause headaches with any regularity ? " In the cool hallway of the house , the doctors left their visitors . No date was set for the next session , Thrasher hoping he could entice Dr. Abelman into meeting him in New York . He wanted to see the old man completely relaxed , at ease , in a different milieu for a change . Leaving , they heard Vogel lecturing his friend ? " Sam , for Chrissake , why do n't you shine your shoes and get a haircut more often ? " ? and it occurred to Thrasher he had often wanted to ask Dr. Abelman the same thing . He had ' never seen Seymour Baumgart , M.
