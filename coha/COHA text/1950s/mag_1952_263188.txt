People who believe in flying saucers got encouragement last week from the skeptical U.S. Air Force . On Jan. 29 , an Air Force spokesman said , strange things were seen in the night sky over North Korea . The tail gunner and fire-control man of a B-29 over Wonsan saw a disk-shaped object that seemed to fly with a revolving motion . It was orange in color , and around its rim were small , bluish flames . For five minutes it flew along with the bomber at 200 m.p.h . Then it disappeared . <P> On the same night , the tail gunner and fire-control man in a B-29 of another squadron saw much the same thing over Sunchon , 80 miles away . The flyers reported that the object looked globular rather than disk-shaped . It followed their plane for more than a minute . Then it vanished too . <P> The orange disks or globes may well have been the exhausts of Communist night fighters . Under some conditions , jet engines have luminous exhausts that glow orange and blue . The interesting point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying-saucer stories and pooh-poohing them all , has apparently decided to become less hostile toward mysteries in the sky . <P> Latest Fashions . The Air Force is not alone . In spite of firm squelching , flying saucer stories have not died . They have changed somewhat with time ; the first ones reported , sighted near Mt . Rainier in 1947 , were round and shiny , and they flew in daylight with no unusual maneuvers . The saucer-conscious public duly reported many more like them . Then the fashion changed when two airline pilots told about seeing , near Montgomery , Ala. one night , an enormous , wingless , cigar-shaped craft with glowing portholes . <P> <P> The cycle of flying-saucer romance had another revolution in 1950 , when Hollywood Columnist Frank Scully produced a book called Behind the Flying Saucers . The saucers , he wrote , are space ships from a foreign planet . They are manned by extraterrestrial midgets who are almost exactly like miniature humans except that they have no beards , only fuzz , and no cavities in their teeth . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built of metal harder than diamond which stands up to temperatures that would wilt any earthly substance . Three of them crashed , said Scully , in the U.S. Southwest , and were impounded by the secretive Air Force , the villain of Scully 's book . ( The Air Force denied everything . ) <P> Green Fireballs . The latest turn of the saucer cycle began last year when Professor Lincoln LaPaz , a reputable meteor expert of the University of New Mexico , announced that there was something very odd indeed about a series of eight bright green fireballs seen over the Southwest during a 13-day period . Meteors are seldom green , said LaPaz , and big ones seldom pass in close sequence over the same place . He suggested that the green meteors might be man-launched missiles . <P> Since the LaPaz pronouncement , many reported saucers have been brightly luminous . They have been seen all over : in New York , Virginia and especially in the Southwest . Both New Mexico and California had a rash of reports last week .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
