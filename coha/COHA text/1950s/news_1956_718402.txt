txt Letters to The Times America 's Position in the U. N. To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Britain and France may use hard words against their old friend the United States for taking the AfroAsian side against them in the recent U. N. vote . Nevertheless , America 's choice in any such issue seems clear ; for incurring the hostility of these up-and-coming nations may have more serious consequences than Anglo-French reproaches . WELSH . New York , Deo. 6 , 1.956 . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The crisis in Eastern Europe has focused world attention upon the relationship between the national communism of Yugoslavia and international communism as exemplified by the Soviet empire . The ideology of communism , we are told , has been " shaken to the core by a phenomenon , nationalism , which it has chosen to ignore . " This is the opinion of C. L. Sulzberger , who has won an enviable reputation as foreign correspondent of The New York Times . It was to be expected therefore that Mr. Sulzberger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to go to considerable lengths in recognizing national communism as a governmental form with which we can deal on a friendly basis . " This coincides with the advice given by The Daily Worker on Oct. 19 . President Josip Broz-Tito who , prior to the demise of Joseph Stalin , had been denounced in that periodical , was pictured as a suitable candidate for continued United States aid , provided money and commodities were to be proffered , as in the past , " without any strings attached . " On the same day The Daily Worker urged support for " expanded foreign economic aid and various forms of peaceful competition with the lands of socialism . " This recommendation , as students of Marxism-Leninism know , was an echo of a " draft resolution " adopted by the Communist party in the United States of America in September , 1956 . Polish Action Closely related to this viewpoint was the willingness of W. Gomulka , new head of the totalitarian Marxist regime in Poland , to accept United States dollars and food , on the terms that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strings attached . " In this . connection it may be recalled that The Times proclaimed on Oct. 17 that " President Eisenhower 's decision with respect to the continuance of American aid to Yugoslavia " seemed " a sound one " and added , rather naively , that " Yugoslavia is not part of a conspiracy for Communist control of the world . " On Nov. 9 , however , the truth about this conspiracy ' began to dawn upon The Times ' editors . Under the caption " Hungary and Yugoslavia " this - great newspaper presented a totally distinct view and a conclusion perfectly in accord with the facts ( i. e. , the Yugoslav votes ) reported from and recorded in the United Nations . The exact phrasing of this fresh approach to the issue of " national communism " vis-a-vis " international communism " may be worthy of repetition here : " With heavy hearts and great indignation the people of the free world have watched as the Russians have drowned the Hungarian revolution in blood . They have watched , too , with horrified amazement the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * The Hungarian people may well be excused if they thought they had every guarantee of Yugoslav help and sympathy in their fight for freedom . " Moral Compromise The Times did not fail to emphasize that " Tito compromised himself morally by signing a friendship agreement with Gero in Belgrade on the eve of the Hungarian revolution . " My own comment about this editorial , excellent as the latter is , may be summarized as follows : It was not " the Russians " who " drowned the Hungarian revolution in blood . " It was the Soviet hierarchy , completely divorced from the ordinary , decent /Liman beings in the Soviet Union , who were guilty of genocide on a scale comparable to that perpetrated by Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler . The Yugoslav people , if free of the much-vaunted " national communism " of President Tito , would have been prompt to spring to the aid of the brave Hungarian patriots . United States guns , planes and tanks in the hands of the totalitarian Marxist-Leninist clique in Belgrade prevented any spontaneous human response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current wordy newspaper war between Pravda and Borba , it may be prudent to observe that the debate , not without its dash of histrionics , has done nothing to turn the tide of slaughter and deportation in the Hungarian captive nation , where a notorious " Titoist , " Premier Janos Kadar , is enacting his bloody role as a Soviet Gauleiter .

Washington , Dec. 8 , 1956 . Praise for Fire Fighters To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As usual The Times , through excellent reporting and coverage , carried fine stories in connection with the disastrous fire and explosion on a Brooklyn pier . No praise is too great for our police , firemen , doctors , nurses and others who helped and worked in a tireless manner . At the Brooklyn conflagration captains and crews aboard Moran , Dal ? zell and other tugs endangered theil lives through fighting that fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition they fought the fire with stream* , of water and they fought in close . I am sure that veteran newspa ? per men who have covered the waterfront , shipping executives , ma. ? rine superintendents and the New York Fire Department join me in paying tribute to the captains and crews of tugs who , time and again , have never been found wanting when it comes to fighting pier and shin I fires . JAMES A. MANNIX . Brooklyn , Dec. 4 , 1956 . Disability Benefits Queried Proposed Maximum for Workmen 's Compensation Opposed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TrmEss Failure of the Workmen 's Corn ? pensation Law of the State of aTevr York to keep pace with the recently liberalized benefit schedules of the Longshoremen 's and Harbor Work ? ers ' Compensation Act has created for dock workers in this state particularly anomalous situation . A longshoreman disabled for four weeks by an injury which occurred aboard a ship , and earning $81 a week or more at the time , will receive $216 in occupational disability benefits . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury occurring on the dock , and thus under the jurisdiction of the laws of New York , will be limited to a total of $108 . Truly this is a discriminatory pattern which literally screams for immediate legislative correction . The response of the Harriman administration has thus far been as disappointing as it has been ri ? diculous and inadequate . Testifying before the Joint Legislative Committee on industrial and labor conditions on Nov. 27 , Mrs. Angela Parisi , chairman of the Workmen 's Compensation Board , urged thall the weekly maximum for occupational disability benefits be limited to $40 . The Federal law provides for a statutory weekly maximum of $54 per week . Mrs. Parisi 's proposal is grossly unfair not only to longshoremen but to every employe in the state . It clearly violates the original un ? derstanding of workmen 's compete . sation which was that the disabled worker would receive two-thirds of his earnings in return for his stn ? rendering his centuries-old common law rights to bring suit against his employer for injuries sustained while working . Average Wage The average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in excess of $80 this year . It is a readily demonstrable fact that for everyone earning less than the average there is one earning more . The Harriman administration 's proposal is especially inexplicable in view of the position taken by members of its own and the Republican party . The Hon. Thomas Curran , chairman of the New York County Republican Committee , ham called for a weekly maximum of at least $54 , Two Democratic members of the Legislature , one in the Assembly and one in the Senate , have promised to introduce bills providing for a weekly maximuns of $75 . This figure , while still violative of the two-thirds quid pre quo of workmen 's compensation , is infinitely superior to the grossly inadequate proposals of the Harri ? man administration .

Gifts for Teachers ? noosed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES The Police Commissioner has rightly forbidden police officers to accept Christmas gratuities . Will the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must my child compete with forty others for her teacher 's favor with a pair of stockings or a box of candy ? Not to do so would make her stand out and feel different front the others . I thought this practice was out ? lawed years ago , but it 's worse nova ? with some classes actually con ? tributing funds for gifts . In my opinion this is a form of graft and should be stopped immediately . MOTHER , New York , Dec. 6 , 1956 .
