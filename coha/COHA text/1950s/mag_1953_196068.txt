No voice in all East Germany has been more bitter in denunciation of the Eisenhower food parcels than obedient Party-liner Hans Hoefs , editor of the Communist Deutschlands Stimme ( Voice of Germany ) . Any East German who accepts the vile " beggar packs " of free U.S. food , wrote Hans , should be severely punished . Last week Communist officials took hungry Hans at his word , fired him for refusing to give up three Eisenhower parcels hidden in his own larder .
