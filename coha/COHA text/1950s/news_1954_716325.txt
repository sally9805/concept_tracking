This was on a vote to give priority in voting to a j mildly worded resolution on I his policies in the windup of a four day debate . Vote Is 324 to 269 The government h a d accepted the resolution , but the assembly refused to consider it by a vote of 324 to 269 .

The two previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laniel survived the last confidence test on May 13 by the scant margin of two votes . Some of his support seems to have melted away since then and there were doubts that he could squeeze thru again . Policies Attacked It was generally agreed that the cabinet will fall as soon as the current Geneva conference on Indo-China is. over . Many deputies may be hesitant about provoking a government upset while the Geneva negotiations are still in progress . In the all-night session , however , deputies on all sides attacked the government 's pollcies and accused the cabinet and Foreign Minister Georges Bidault in particular of not working hard enough for peace at Geneva . Bidault , after exchanging denunciations with Russian Foreign Minister Molotov and Red Chinese Premier Chou En-lai at Geneva , came to Paris to fight for the work he has done . He told the assembly the chances for a truce have been fully exhausted at Geneva and offered to step aside if the assembly thought someone else could do better . The premier then called a halt on the assembly wrangling and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French White House , to formalize the move for the vote of confidence .
