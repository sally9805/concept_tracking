Most new magazines start out with small circulations , hopefully strive for the big time over a period of months or years . But last week a new magazine came out , trumpeting a guaranteed circulation of 1,500.000 . Its name : Better Living . It is the latest addition to the family of slick-paper , slickly written magazines sold chiefly at the check-out counters of chain stores and supermarkets . These folksy , foxy supermagazines which lure people into stores , then help sell the store 's products , now have a combined circulation of about 10 million a month . <P> Better Living is the superproduct of Manhattan Promoter Edward W. Miller , the Supermarket Institute , representing some 5.000 U.S. stores , and McCall 's , which provided $750,000 , its printing plant and know-how . Miller raised another $750,000 from such private investors as Nelson Rockefeller and Clendenin Ryan ( onetime owner of the American Mercury ) . Not till he had supermarket outlets for at least a million copies did Publisher Miller set his editorial staff to work . Said he : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this business . But you 've got to have a good book , you have to spend money , and you ca n't look for profits right off the bat . " <P> High Mortality . The reason for his restrained optimism is that the mortality in the field has been high ; out of a hundred such magazines started in the past decade , only a handful are left . The first supermagazine was started 18 years ago by Harry Evans , onetime managing editor of the old Life . His Family Circle , a weekly throwaway to plug the wares of 1,275 Piggly Wiggly , Sanitary and Reeves stores , leaned heavily on food , fashion and Hollywood for its copy . It was so successful ( 1,000,000 circulation within a year ) that Evans began to charge 2 for it . <P> Five years ago , it switched to a nickel monthly aimed at all ages ( sample subjects : pets , " Teen Scene , " " Are You Making Good as a Grandma ? " ) . With 18 editions for its distributors ( Safeway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost its guaranteed circulation from 2,300,000 to 3,000,000 . <P> Low Caesarean . In 1937 the Great Atlantic &; Pacific Tea Co. brought out Woman 's Day to plug A. &; P. lines . Now the giant of the field ( circ. 3.900,000 ) , the magazine crams its 124 to 188 slick pages with national ads , moony love stories and how-to-do-it articles ( samples : how to re-string pearls , build cabinets , read faster , eat on a low budget ) . But A. &; P. takes little profit out of its Woman 's Day . The cash is put into more color pages and better copy to dress up the lure for shoppers . <P> Like the others , * Better Living 's 96-page first issue is full of how-to-do-its ( freeze strawberries , rewire lamps , earn money at home , arrange flowers , etc. ) , and the kind of clinical fiction housewives seem to love . The leading story is a cheerful piece on a day in the life of an obstetrician , by Old Standby Faith Baldwin . Sample quote : " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measurements and the X ray would chart his course of action-a low Caesarean section , he hoped . " Concludes the doctor at day 's end : " What a wonderful job I have , what a wonderful life ! " <P> <P> * Among them : Everywoman 's ( circ. 1,000,000 ) , Western Family ( circ. 670,000 ) , American Family ( circ. 500,000 ) .
