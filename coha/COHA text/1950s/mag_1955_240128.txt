The reformed drunkards numbered only 100 or so after four years of often-discouraging efforts when , in 1939 , they decided to publish a guide to giving up alcohol . The collaborators ' first choice for a title was The Way Out . But a check at the Library of Congress showed twelve previous works thus named ; the authors shied at the 13th , settled instead for their second choice , Alcoholics Anonymous . It has sold 300,000 copies . <P> Last week the 5,000 A.A. members gathered in St. Louis had two items to celebrate : 1 ) their 20th anniversary , which marks their growth to a massive fellowship of 150,000 reformed alcoholics organized into 6,000 chapters in more than 50 countries , and 2 ) publication of a new and enlarged ( 575 pages ) edition of " the big book , " as they fondly call Alcoholics Anonymous ( Alcoholics Anonymous Publishing Co. ; $4.50 ) . <P> News from a Broker . Bill W. , a former Wall Street broker and surviving co-founder of A.A. , argued that it was time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the elder statesmen , and the delegates agreed by ratifying a charter with a 15-member board of trustees . He also noted a switch in emphasis : now that its fame is widespread , A.A. gets more and more alcoholics ( about half its new members ) who have not yet sunk out of social respectability into Skid Row obscurity , who have had little or no experience with delirium , hospitals and jails . In consequence , A.A. is approaching closer to preventive medicine . Such cases make up one of the most encouraging sections of the new edition of Alcoholics Anonymous . A prime example : <P> A neurosurgeon named Earl in a Western state had always been fortune 's darling ; class president from high school through medical school and a professional success , he had never lost family or income because of alcohol . ( " I made more money the last year of my drinking than I ever made before in my whole life . " ) He knew that something had to give when he found that the drinks he craved made him miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him an A.A. pamphlet . For the moment it had no effect . But a few evenings later , as he was opening his second fifth , the thought struck him : " This is the last one ! " <P> Help from a Butcher . The break came easy for Dr. Earl , but continued abstinence came hard . Although he was a graduate of 5 years in psychoanalysis he had to call on the local butcher , a pillar of A.A. , for guidance when the going got rough . The butcher brought the doctor down to earth , interested him in A.A. 's program of mutual support . Dr. Earl has not had a drink for three years . <P> In writing his own case history , the doctor speculates whether A.A. 's curative power should be called " benevolent interpersonal relations " or group psychotherapy . Then , like so many other successful A.A. members , he gives his own answer : " To me it is God .
