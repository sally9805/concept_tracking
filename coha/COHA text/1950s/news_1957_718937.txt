txt Walter O'Malley , . president of the Brooklyn Dodgers , told a House Antitrust investigating subcommittee today that he would keep the team somewhere in New York if the terms he twice had agreed to meet were accepted . To date , Mr. O'Malley charged , New York City officials have " sabotaged " on two occasions his efforts to keep the team there . Now , he added , " time is i running out . " Los Angeles , he warned , is working hard and with " constructive " proposals , to get the Dodgers there . The inducements , he conceded ? are difficult to overlook . . Yet , Mr. O'Malley insisted , his mind is still " open . " However , he said that those behind the recent move to hold the Dodgers at home had better " show something " more concrete than previous actions . A. similar situation .. faced the New York Giants . ' They have been urged ' to move to San Francisco . Horace Stoneham , president of the Giants , waited all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance was postponed- by the subcommittee until July 10 or later . Meanwhile , Abe Stark , president of . the ? New York City Council , urged Congress to " proceed with caution before attempting to regulate the game of baseball unless the public interest is directly involved or the sport itself is threatened . " However , Mr. - Stark added , " in one afternoon " last May 28 baseball was given a treatment of ! the ' public be damned " by the National League . On that day , Mr. Stark held , the baseball tradition of fair play before ardent fans was " arrogantly and callously cast aside " by a league decision to permit the Dodgers and the Giants to go West . The decision held that if the Dodgers went to Los Angeles the Giants also could go to San Francisco . Statement Is Challenged Mr. Stark added that , as a rule , fans were not ' concerned about questions of monopoly , reserve clauses , waivers , options or other business practices of baseball . What they wanted , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representative Emanuel Celler , Democrat of Brooklyn , broke lin to challenge *this idea . The public , he held , was vitally concerned in Monopolies . Mr. Stark said that Ford C. Frick , the ' commissioner of baseball , had been overruled ? in this decision and ' had capitulated , though he should ' have held his ground . The baseball game , Mr. Stark - added , is in the hands of " robber baron 's " and " pirates " in which the public is " brushed aside . " If the West Coast wanted a major league , he said , it could build one of its own without " changing the names and addresses of existing teams . " What has developed , he contended , is " pitting city against city in an unsportsmanlike civil war . " If the committee is looking for safeguards against monopoly in baseball , Mr. Stark stated , it had better Aook into present plans to install paytelevision. for the TV viewing of sports . " The prospect of easy money and wind-fall profits from toll TV , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme to transfer the Dodgers and Giants to the Pacific Coast . " He added that " an unholy alliance was at work on this project . " Mr. O'Malley retorted later that Mr. Stark was a friend of his , a " fine fellow . " But , he added , . " he Mr. Stark does n't know what he 's talking about . " Mr. O'Malley said he personally had put some $5,000,000 into projects to keep the Dodgers at least near home plate . . Further , . he stated , he had guaranteed in writing to cover a capital investment of $10,000,000 for a stay-at-home project for the Dodgers in. a proposed - sports center in Flushing Meadows when efforts to keep " the Bums " in Brooklyn fell through . But , he added , he has received no response to this offer . Keating Continues Fight The subcommittee appeared to feel that the Dodgers and the Giants were going West . Representative Kenneth B. Keating of upstate New York , the ranking Republican , continued his fight to keep the New York teams home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' O'Connor , president of the Pacific Coast League , a minor organization , said that the arrival of two big league teams might have a disastrous effect on the baseball situation on the West Coast . Already , he testified , the major leagues , through the reserve clause operations and working agreements hold control over more than 5,000 professional baseball players . He conceded that many , of the players , discouraged by the application of major-league control , may have quit baseball . But he insisted that the major league control was- complete .
