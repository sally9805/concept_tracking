txt If generally accepted , this Portuguese view would widen considerably the NATO door to admit any country in sympathy with western military defense aims , regardless of the character of the home regime . This would appear at first sight somewhat at variance with the purposes of NATO set forth in , the relative paragraphs of the NATO treaty , but the Portuguese Government has made its position clear from the outset . Possibly an indirect answer to Dr. Cunha 's argument was supplied by United States Secretary of State Dean Acheson , who spoke shortly afterward and who reminded his listeners , " The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was itself the creation of democracy . . being . confronted and endangered by one of the oldest types of political institutions , a rigid . military autocracy ruled by police power . ? . it bespeaks well , . of democracies to safeguard their freedom . " Mood Changes During the past few hours  --  just before the opening of the NATO conference  --  a remarkable change in the mood of the delegates has taken place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few preparatory days , the . Feb. 19 communiques of the London conference on the European , defense community and German participation in it appeared to have quite transformed the outlook of the delegations who had almost resigned themselves to another round of frustrations and postponements , such as Rome witnessed . . - In the first flush of optimism , the people were even inclined to minimize their lingering doubts and uncertainties over the avoidance in the communiqu  --  s of any references to Germany 's entry into NATO and the circumstance of the agreements reached in London by French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman and West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer with British-American coaching . Agreements Wait Backing These agreements must still be approved by the Paris and Bonn parliaments , whence are already audible intransigent murmurs that these respective foreign nunisters gave away too much . In any event , the London agreements are construed here as a green light to proceed with the practical groundwork for a European army and of defending the relationships between the Euro pean defense community and NATO . Feeling is that once work gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves out . In this connection , special significance is attached here to the word " integrity " used in the western Big Three communiqu ? to describe the European defense community . It is hoped this , plus the assurance Britain and America intend to keep their troops in Europe , will allay French apprehensions that the German armed forces in Europe now to be built into the defense community might one day pull out and be used to reassert old aggressive aims . Apart from the crucial German question , the council must settle on the practical ways and means for implementing both short-term 1952 and long-term 1954 European rearmament programs . ? First of all , it must produce firm commitments so that Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower will know what he will have by the end of the year . Military planners firmly insist there must be a minimum of 50 divisions available by next December , of which about half actually are under arms , remainder to be mobilized within 30 days . France and Italy Tarry The figure for the end of 1954 is 100 divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original report of the Temporary Council Committee had not recognized the military should have the final word for setting the requirements from each country and had proceeded instead on the basis of what TCC felt each country would provide . On this basis , TCC had ended up with 10 per cent fewer divi ? sions than the military deemed essential . Even the 50 divisions presumably available this year will be deficient in artillery and especially tanks . As regards the air-power , the problem is airfields rather than planes , and this comes under the specially coined heading " infrastructure , " which used to designate all permanent NATO installations . Supreme Headquarters . Allied Powers , in Europe months ago submitted exact plans plus ccst estimates covering its airfield requirements . It still is up to the ccuncil to decide how the costs of airfields are to be split among NATO members . The same holds for other permanent installations , such as headquarters buildings , arms , equipment , depots , and so on .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
