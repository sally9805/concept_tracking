txt Chicago 's n c ed for more water from Lake Michigan to flush the Illinois waterway " far outweighs whatever slight IeInporary loss , if a n y , that might be sustained in adjacent areas , " the House public works committee reported to Congress Monday . The committee reported out II . R. 1 , introduced by Rep. Thomas J. O'Brien ID. , Chicago , which would authorize the city to divert an additional 1,000 cubic feet of water a second from Lake Michigan into the waterway for sanitation and navigation purposes . The city now takes 1,500 cubic feet of water a second from the lake . Tells Pollution Problem " The purpose of H. R. 1 , " the committee report said , " would be to permit a test period of diversion to be evaluated in a study of its possible effects on the sewage treatment problem at Chicago . ' " I'he bill is supported by the city of Chicago and others who are seeking a solution to the pressing poi ; lotion problem which exists at Chicago . Witnesses testified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a solution " The committee said that opponents of the diversion bill argued that increased diversion would lower the levels of the Great Lakes and " adversely affect their interests , particularly from the standpoint of hydro-electric power production and navigation . " Effect " Negligible " The committee said that the army engineers testified that the maximum lowering of the lake levels would be less that one-fourth of an inch " under the proposed test diversion . " The resultant effect on navigation , " the committee said , " would be negligible and there would be no measurable losses from decreased tonnage or revenues . " It said if there should he any loss in electric power production elsewhere on the lakes , it would be more than offset by gains in power production in Lockport , Ill. , on the waterway . " No Legal Obstacle " As to Canada 's objections , which in the past have result ? ed in Presidential vetoes of lake diversion bills , the committee said : " There is no legal obstacle to diversion , and the commit . tee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be resolved by appropriate negotiations be ? tween the two countries . " As to the objections of the members f r o m the Pacific northwest that if Chicago gets increased di v e r s i o n , Canada might use its act as a " precedent " to divert waters from the Columbia riier system , the committee said : " The committee feels that the two problems are entirely dissimilar and that the one year diversion at Ch i c a go proposed in H. II . I could by ** no stretch of the imagination be taken as a problem similar h. % magnitude or in type to the problem of a possible Columbia river diversion , which the committee believes to be a very remote possibility in any event . " " Even More Justified " The committee said that it feels that . legislation it has approved in the past for *Hicreased diversion " is still justified and the bill herein reported is even more justified . " ? " It is the view of the committee , " the report said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most pressing problems of a great metropolitan area far outweighs whatever slight temporary loss , if any , that might be sustained in adjacent areas . " O'Brien said the House leadership has notified him that the bill has been scheduled for debate on the floor Wednesday . Twelve Republicans signed a minority report opposing the diversion bill , declaring " it is the camel 's nose under the tent . " They said a one year 's diversion " will set the stage for even greater permanent diversion in the future . " They said that it will give " preferential treatment to Illinois to the dpnage of other Great Lake states and Canada . "
