In a Manhattan courtroom , an all-male blue-ribbon jury studiously listened to the story of a thoroughly senseless murder . Seven boys , 15 to 19 , were on trial for the gang killing of polio-crippled , 15-year-old Michael Farmer in a Washington Heights park in upper Manhattan last summer ( TIME , Aug. 12 ) . Developed by the prosecution and no fewer than 27 court-appointed defense lawyers , the story unfolded slowly : the gang , called the Egyptian Dragons , had armed themselves with knives , a machete , a heavy dog chain , sticks , pipes and garrison belts , slipped into the park looking for members of a rival gang . They found no rivals ; only the Farmer boy and a friend . Neither belonged to any gang . Unable to defend himself , Michael Farmer fell under stabs , kicks , stomps and blows . <P> There were 18 Egyptian Dragons in all , Negroes and whites . Eleven , aged 13 and 14 , were shipped off to a reformatory as juvenile delinquents . The remaining seven , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of them changed their stories ( " I did n't see nobody do nothin ' " ) , protested that they had been beaten into confessions by the police . Last week , after 24 hours of discussion , the jury wound up the city 's longest murder trial ( 14 weeks , 6,000 pages of testimony ) . Verdict : three defendants were acquitted ; two were convicted of murder in the second degree ( sentence : 20 years to life ) , two of manslaughter in the second degree ( maximum penalty : 15 years ) . The guilty four : <P> Louis Alvarez , 17 , born in Puerto Rico , arrived in the U.S. at the age of four ; three years later his mother died . He was captain of a baseball team , member of the Police Athletic League . Assistant president of the Egyptian Dragons , he shouldered out the president , made himself boss . On the night of the murder , he confessed , he had steeled his courage by getting drunk on cheap wine . He used a knife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 , husky ( 6 ft. 2 in. , 170 Ibs . ) , Alabama-born Negro , picked cotton 14 hours a day when he was seven , went to New York at 15 to live with his mother , whom he had seen previously only once a year . He confessed that he played his role " to show the others I was doing something . " He swung the machete . <P> Leroy Birch ( nickname : Magician ) , 19 , Negro , came from a broken home , lived with grandparents . Acknowledged as " counselor " for the younger boys , he advised the gang on strategy , denied participating in the murder . <P> Leoncio DeLeon ( nickname : Jello ) , 17 , born in the Dominican Republic , arrived in the U.S. alone in 1952 , quit school to help support his mother , has not seen his father in six years . He used a stick . <P> Two who felt that the jury was too merciful to all seven were Michael Farmer 's parents . Said City Fireman Raymond Farmer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get away with murder-a green light for them to do anything . My wife and I are not brutal . We do n't demand an eye for an eye . But I thought possibly Michael 's death would n't be in vain . Now he 's a lost cause , an absolutely wasted life . These marauding savages have made a laughingstock of the law . I can just see the grins and the ha-ha 's in the neighborhood where the Egyptian Dragons live . "
