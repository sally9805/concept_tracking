THE SLEEPLESS MOON ( 375 pp. ) -H . E. Bates-Atlantic-Little , Brown ( $4 ) . <P> <P> The main question raised by British Novelist Herbert Ernest Bates is : How long can a writer go on being promising without paying off ? In Bates 's case , the answer seems to be indefinitely . Now 50 , he had more fine short stories to his credit in his thirties than most good writers turn out in a lifetime . But short stories do not pay well , and Bates , like any sensible fictioneer , wants to be paid as well as read . So novels it was , and promising though several of them were , his admirers usually laid them down at the end quite sure that things would go better next time . <P> Like just about everything Bates has written , The Sleepless Moon is well carpentered , easily written , and well calculated to shorten a train ride or add pleasure to a tall drink . In a small English town , Constance is married to the town grocer , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no chance . His comfortable household runs like a metronome , but his bed has a built-in deepfreeze . Not only does the virginal Constance wait in vain on her wedding night , she waits in vain , period . <P> Even in staid English provincial circles , nature has a way of filling marital vacuums . Frankie , the goodlooking young piano player at the local cinema , is just brash enough to make a pass at Constance , even though Melford is by now sure to become the next mayor of the town . A kiss on a snowy night , and Constance is done for . Soon she and Frankie are meeting in alleys , in old mills and , come spring , splashing idyllically in secret pools . Melford , no different from other husbands in a like fix , is naturally the last to know . What is more , he does not care . Then a tasty dish at a nearby tavern supplies for Melford what Melford apparently wanted all along , but Constance never knew how to offer . <P> Always expert at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bates seems not to know how to get out of the double mess he has contrived , and put The Sleepless Moon to sleep . But in the last extremity , there is a classic way out for all novelists in a jam , and Bates uses it . The tavern wench dies of an abortion , and unhappy Melford is let off his hook . Frankie runs out on Constance , but she is still hooked in the heart , and pitches herself from the church tower . What this trite tale of love and death is intended to light up hardly matters . But women may wonder what Novelist Bates means by letting the men off so easily : Melford ends up with a comfortable widower 's life , Frankie comes back to town to cad about with not one , but several , fluttery innocents . It 's a man 's world .
