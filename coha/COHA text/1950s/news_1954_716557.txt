txt Representative Jacob K. Javits , Republican candidate for At-I torney General , served notice yesterday that he was not toning down his liberal views to suit conservative elements in the Republican party . " I will be what I was in any office I serve in , " he declared at an interview in his law office , 630 Fifth Avenue . He added : " I believe all the things I worked for . I 'll stand and fight for all the same beliefs that I stood for in the Congress . " Mr. Javits , describing himself , as " liberal by philosophy , " said his nomination " represented something of a success for mod-I ernism in the Republican party , and that is all to the good . " The candidate conceded that he had been critical in the past on several points in the record of Governor Dewey , but on the whole , he said , he believed it had been a good record . " But I 'm not running on Dewey 's record , " he asserted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disagreed With Dewey Mr. Javits did not see eye-toeye with the State Administration on the 15 per cent across-theboard rent increase authorized in 1951 , and he differed in details on the handling of the transit situation . Presumably referring to opposition within the Republican party in his bid last year for the Republican nomination for Mayor , Mr. Javits said he was the " personal choice " for Attorney General of Senator Irving M. Ives , the candidate for Governor . " Suffice it to say , " he observed , I " if there had been no Ives , there ! would have been no Javits . " Asserting that Tammany Hall , I the New York County Democratic organization , was in con- ' trol of the Democratic party in the state , Mr. Javits said a Democratic victory would mean that " Tammany would control both city and state , with no check and no balance . " With a Republican administration in Albany , he added , " the people of New York have had the check and the balance of an effective state government since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Tammany Hall 's record in New York City , in the way it has run the city , has a background of waste and corruption , " he declared . " That is not ancient history , because the Crime Commission has backed up these findings within the very recent past . " Mr. Javits said it was not his business to say what went on within the Democratic party , but it was his duty , as a candidate for state office , to say what effect it would have if that party got into power . He said ' Averell Harriman , the Democratic candidate for Governor , was the personal choice of Carmine G. DeSapio , leader of Tammany , and that his own opponent , Mr. Roosevelt , " appears also to have been taken into camp by being given a place on the ticket . " Mr. ? Roosevelt accepted the nomination for Attorney General after he had failed to get the nomination for Governor .. Mr. Javits said the office of Attorney General should not be considered " as some step in political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or state party conventions . " This was obviously a reference to the fact that his opponents showing in the election may be interpreted as a test of Mr. Roosevelt 's personal strength in relation to the strength of the state and city Democratic organizations that favored Mr. Harriman for Governor . It was the closest Mr. Javits came to attacking his opponent , whom he called his " N.sorql friend . " Mr. Harriman , who addressed the annual convention of the New York State Council of Machinists at Elmira Saturday , received the council 's endorsement yesterday as did Mr. Roosevelt . The council is composed of delegates from locals of the International Association of Machinists , A. F. L. Mr. Harriman sent a telegram yesterday to Senator lye 's urging his rival to join him in the preparation of a motion picture that would appeal to_the eligible voters to register . Registration days in this city and Westchester County will be divided this year . Registration will start Thursday and continue on Friday and on Monday , Tuesday , Thursday and Friday of next week .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
