txt Prof. Harold Somers , in his interesting comments- on the proposal that wages be adjusted periodically for rises in the cost of living , argues that such an arrangement would give workers stake in inflation " and thus make them indifferent to ' it . As a matter of fact , this arrangeITtent , combined with the rule that larger wage adjustments be made only when required by the defense program , would provide the basis for a Government policy of restraint on wage increases . Some Government restraint on wage increases is necessary because , in a strong sellers ' market , uncontrolled collective bargaining is bound to- push up wages rapidly ? as recent experience shows . But restraints have no chance of working against strong and aggressive unions unless the restraints command wholehearted support from the public . In view of the demonstration during the Second World War that price ceilings on food and apparel are not effective , a rule that limited workers to smaller wage adjustments than the rise in the cost of living would not be regarded by the public as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective enforcement . Wage increases that exceed the rise in the cost of living will hardly be regarded as fair at a time when personal incomes after taxes are rising faster than the output of consumer goods . Had the cost-ofliving adjustment rule been in effect during the Second World War , the rise in straight-line hourly earnings would have been slower , not faster . Increased Savings Professor Somers objects to purchasing-power bonds on the ground that . they would not appreciably in crease savings because they would be purchased out of capital rather than income . This amounts to saying that all attempts to stimulate saving by bond-selling campaigns will yield negligible results . Certainly if people will not increase their savings in order to buy purchasing-power bonds , they will not increase their savings at a time of rising prices to buy bonds of the traditional sort . During the next nine months the physical output of consumer goods will not increase , but personal incomes after taxes ( at present tax rates ) will rise by about $15 billion or more per year . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the excess of personal incomes .. Consequently , prices will rise unless personal savings increase . Offering a way of escaping the penalty that rising prices impose on thrift is surely the first step in inducing people to save more . Between 1947 and 1950 , among spending units with incomes of $3,000 to $4,999 ,  --  the proportion of units owning liquid assets of $500 or more decreased from 66 per cent to 47 per cent ; and among spending units with incomes of $5,000 or more the proportion decreased from 90 per cent to 74 per cent . With an attractive security to offer , it ought to be possible to make the ownership of liquid assets at least as extensive as it was in 1947. reply and a request for more information , including draft status .

To Prevent War With China Suffering of Population in Civil War and Invasion Recalled To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I am not a pacifist nor a Communist , but I hope I am a realist . Before it is too late there should be a movement among all clear-thinking people to prevent any war with China . We in the nited States profess great affection for the Chinese people . A war against China would add immeasurable suffering to the suffering these people have had to endure : years , of civil war followed by invasion from Japan . At last they have a , stable Government , whether we like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in China . But we could bomb their towns and . cities and cause untold misery among the masses for whom we profess such deep feeling . If by chance the United States did upset the present regime , what would they put in its place ? Would those people who advocate an aggressive war against Red China put Chiang Kai-shek and his corrupt Nationalist Government back into power ? In the October number of the Harvard Medical Alumni Bulletin there appears an article by Dr. Goodrich C. Schauffler . This young doctor spent two years in China , and his description of the bribery , corruption and greed of the Nationalist Government is enough to convince us once and for all that the Nationalist Government , was not a Government for the common people . Drugs and hospital supplies donated by the United States Government were sold at exorbitant prices for the rich . The poor masses of China have no medical treatment . Because of their inability to pay they are refused admission to Government and mission hospitals . Dr. Schauffler paints a most terrifying and damning picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture . It would be the greatest tragedy of the human race if the United States Government , urged on by certain pub-. lications and Senators , precipitated us . into a war with these helpless people  --  a war we could not win . There is no disgrace in meeting the leaders of China , admitting China into the United Nations and coming to some agreement with them . CHARLES S. CURTIS , C. B. E. , M. D ..

Limited Rises I agree that the growth in the value of bonds might have a small tendency to encourage consumer expenditures even before the bonds were cashed . But this effect could not occur until sufficient quantities of the bonds had been purchased to make people feel able to cut their ? rate of saving ? in other words , not until the purchase of the bonds had itself limited the rise in prices ) Nor would ' the effect on spending be large , because the bonds would not have risen in purchasing power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by berg converted into goods under conditions of inflation does not impress me as likely . Under such conditions the purchasing-power bonds would be among the last assets that owners would convert into cash and goods . Before the purchasing-power bonds were redeemed and converted into goods , savings bonds of the present type , savings-bank deposits and cash would be converted into goods be , cause , as prices rose , all of these assets would lose in value . It is the present type of savings bond , redeemable on demand and subject to loss in value if prices rise , that is an inflationary threat . SUMNER H. SLICHTER . Cambridge , Mass. , Jan. 6 , 1951 . Job Discrimination Against Reserves To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As an officer , I am writing you because of a serious personal problem that I believe may affect many other reserve officers and men . I know of at least ' one other-in my battalion . Briefly , this is the situation . I am an advertising , or . commercial , artist looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have not found it . As an example , recently an employment agency sent me to a large company , as the agency felt that I was well qualified to fill the job in question . I , was interviewed by a young - lady in personnel , and things went very . well . I filled out forms and we talked about salary . I. was to be interviewed by the art director as the - next step . The personnel girl asked me if I were a veteran and then if I was in the reserve . I tried to explain that I did not . expect . to be called unless there was a total mobilization and in suck case Ifelt that most able-bodied . veterans would go back in the service . It did n't go over . I never saw the . art director . . . , Again , I answered an ad ' iri the Sunday TIMES and received an interested Israel 's Korea Proposal To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I regret that a typing error in the U. N. press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the account of your distinguished U. N. correspondent of the proceedings of the Political Committee on Jan. 5 . In his address before that committee , Ambassador Eban described the fourth point of Israel 's Korea proposal : " An agreement for the progressive . withdrawal - of all non-Korean forces from Korea within a defined period , in conditions which would genuinely leave the Korean people free to determine their own future . " In the U. N. press release on which your correspondent based his communication the word " generally " occurs instead of " genuinely . " I should be glad if the correct text could now bo brought before your readers ' notice . The difference is one of substance , since the whole trend of the Ambassador 's speech was to show that the United Nations will not discharge its responsibility in Korea until the people of that country are free to determine its future . It would obviously not be satisfactory for the United Nations to be satisfied with a general and approximate arrangement in that respect . Y. H.
