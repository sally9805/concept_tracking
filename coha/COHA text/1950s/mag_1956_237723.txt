The man who engineered Adlai Stevenson 's campaign through the primaries and into the convention is now setting a course for the White House : James Aloysius Finnegan . <P> Early Life : Born in Philadelphia , Dec. 20 , 1906 . Father ( an oil-refinery worker ) and mother came from County Mayo , Ireland . Graduated from West Philadelphia 's Catholic High School for Boys , studied accounting at University of Pennsylvania 's night school . <P> Career : At 24 entered Depression politics , within a year was chairman of his ward 's executive committee . In 1939 Philadelphia 's Congressman ( later Senator ) Frank Myers made Finnegan his secretary . Enlisted in the Army Air Forces in 1942 ( air combat intelligence ) , was discharged a lieutenant colonel in 1946 . Thrusting once again into home-town politics , he was elected his party 's city chairman , built his success by staying mostly in the background and pushing attractive candidates , e.g. , Philadelphia Mayors Joe Clark ( 1951 ) and Richardson Dilworth ( 1955 ) . In 1954 he helped persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run for governor . Leader won , appointed Finnegan Secretary of the Commonwealth . <P> Early in 1952 , he saw Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson on TV , decided then that Adlai was a sure winner . At the 1952 convention , he helped run the draft-Stevenson movement on the floor , returned to Philadelphia to whip up enthusiasm for the national ticket . Result : Philadelphia gave Stevenson a majority of 160,000 votes . <P> Techniques : Meticulous planner , canny strategist , he worked from file cards showing names , family and business connections , clubs , hobbies , likes , dislikes of all 1956 convention delegates and alternates . After Stevenson 's California victory , Finnegan crossed Kefauver off his list , recognized Harriman as Stevenson 's foremost opponent . He roused Stevenson ( who was ready to take it easy ) , began shuttling him into the West . On a plane to Denver , Adlai complained : " Why do I have to make all these trips ? " " Because , " said Finnegan evenly , " Averell Harriman might beat you . " Adlai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Personality &; Politics : Silver-haired , trim and ruddy , Finnegan is a light eater , disdains cigars , watches his blood pressure like a campaign manager watching a wavering delegate . No jolly backslapper or joke-smith , he has only an ordinary memory for names and faces , seldom relaxes ( " The only time I ever knew him to relax , " says Campaign Executive Director Hy Raskin , " was when he took off a weekend in Atlantic City . And then all he did was to sit on someone 's front porch and talk politics " ) . He has never married . He blends a good sense of practical politics with a fairly idealistic view of " good government . " Typical Finneganisms : " Good government is good politics . " " There should be a reward for those who make a consistent effort for the party . When men have an ability in their jobs and also are a potent political force and are really interested in it , why should n't they get a job ?
