ANATOMY OF A MORAL ( 181 pp. ) - Milovan Djilas-Praeger ( $2.95 ) . <P> BITTER HARVEST ( 313 pp. ) - Edited by Edmund Stillman , introduction by Franois Bondy-Praeger ( $5 ) . <P> " Aloneness . " brooded Poet W. H. Auden during a leaden hour of World War II , " is man 's real condition . " Nearly two decades later , the saga of Soviet Poet Boris ( Doctor Zhivago ) Pasternak suggests that the century 's loneliest crowd consists of creative intellects behind Iron and . Bamboo Curtains . Even when these curtains rise briefly , as during the thaw that followed Stalin 's death , they reveal strictly solitary singers . At one time or another , the authors represented in these two collections of protesting voices belonged to the chummy writers ' cliques of Warsaw . Belgrade and other Red capitals . Yet most of their experiences have been shaped into painfully isolated visions . <P> Product of Apostasy . Few of the Soviet world 's captive minds have been as alone as Milovan Djilas ' . Once a Tito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself that Communism is the inevitable foe of revolutionary ideals . This disenchantment produced The New Class ( TIME , Sept. 9 , 1957 ) , a dazzling indictment of Marxism as the opiate of the masses . An earlier product of his apostasy is Anatomy of a Moral , 18 casual essays written for two of Belgrade 's leading journals when Djilas was still the party 's Red-haired boy . The speculations begin innocently enough : a yawningly orthodor insistence that Yugoslavia must wiggle between the traps of Stalinist " bureaucratism " and " decadent " Western capitalism . But as the articles progress . Djilas begins to weaken in the marrow of his own faith ; complaint turns to critique as he demands such subversive luxuries as free speech and free elections , equality of all before the law . <P> For as long as he could . Djilas refused to believe that Communism must destroy basic human liberties ; yet the insight proved inevitable . It came with the New Year of 1954 . Under attack from party logicians . Djilas wrote in the title essay of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real incident , the stinging fable tells of a blithe young actress who marries an aging , swashbuckling wartime hero , then finds herself brutally snubbed by the petted women of Yugoslavia 's bureaucratic clique . In violently purple prose , Djilas lashes at this " sham aristocracy " which , " when not loafing about in their magnificent parvenu offices , moved from place to place , lived in their own select and restricted summer resorts , gathered in their own exclusive theaters and stadium boxes . " The point of Djilas ' attack is not privilege itself , but privilege in the hands of those who had betrayed the revolution , who fed the country a " dogmatism . . . which corroded all ethical values . " Scorned-as the author clearly felt that he and an entire nation had been scorned-his unnamed heroine retreats to the rough-hewn comradeship of the stage . After a triumphant performance in a theater crowded with her enemies , she collapses on her sofa in melodramatic tears , unable to solve the curt , inexorable questions that Djilas himself could not really answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
