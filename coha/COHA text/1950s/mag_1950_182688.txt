The molded plywood chair that California 's Charles Eames helped to design ten years ago is a sort of model T in modern furniture . Some 60,000 of the spindly , plain but surprisingly comfortable chairs have been sold , and today they can be found under the rumps of connoisseurs across the nation . Last week Designer Eames had tooled up a brand-new $175,000 factory , was turning out the first 3,000 models of his 1950 line . <P> Composed of a single plastic and Fiberglas shell mounted on legs , the new chair is more roomy , stable and luxurious , but just as simple as its predecessor . Pictures of the chair were being reproduced in dozens of newspapers and magazines , and an enthusiastic House Beautiful editor rhapsodically described it as " the sitting sensation of modern design . " <P> A tweedy , pipe-smoking , 43-year-old who still looks rather like a college boy , Eames designs other things besides chairs . He works with three admiring young assistants in a studio littered with kites , machine tools , Indian relics , driftwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas for new designs . At one time or another , Eames has tackled everything from movie sets to a molded plywood splint used by the Navy during the war ( " A forerunner of the furniture , " says Eames , " because it supported the body and was sympathetic to it " ) . <P> He also designed his own slick steel and glass Pacific Palisades house , where he lives with his artist-wife , boasts that they " have not been to a cocktail party in four years . " For recreation , they go camping in the Mojave Desert , and fill their house as well as the workshop with everything from Chinese fans and Indian blankets to tumbleweeds and bits of machinery . Pointing to the jumble , Eames says : " We want to help people enjoy the richness of simple stuff . " <P> Eames is pleased , but still not entirely satisfied with his new chair . It will sell for $28 and he wishes he could design just as good a chair for less . " The objective , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the best to the greatest number of people for the least . " He hopes to do the same thing with other furniture and even houses .
