For years the white-supremacist fathers of Tuskegee , county seat of Macon County , Ala. , have contemplated two obtrusive facts about their small ( pop . 6,700 ) , highly segregated community . Fact No. 1 : about 70% ( 4,800 ) of Tuskegee 's residents are Negro . Fact No. 2 : the town is the site of Tuskegee Institute , one of the South 's influential Negro campuses and a powerhouse in the struggle for civil rights . The fear that some of the institute 's teachings , e.g. , on the Negro 's right to the ballot , would seep into the town of Tuskegee has been heightened by a steady increase in Negro registration-despite the fact that meetings of the all-white board of registrars have been few and far between . White voters still outnumber registered Negro voters , but the margin is growing slim-about 600-400 . <P> Drastic Remedy . To Macon County 's State Senator Sam Engelhardt Jr. , executive secretary of the Alabama Association of Citizens ' Councils , the remedy was obvious . Sam Engelhardt , taking a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's Negroes live in the northwest quadrant near the institute or to the south of it . The remedy , which he proposed to the state legislature this spring : shrink the city limits by some 50%-and in such a way as to reduce Tuskegee 's Negro population to about 400 , its registered Negro voters to nine . Both houses unanimously passed Engelhardt 's gerrymander bill , sent it on to Governor James E. ( " Kissin ' Jim " ) Folsom . <P> But Sam Engelhardt and his fellow legislators had overlooked an important point : if the heavy Negro population of Tuskegee and surrounding Macon County provides a political hazard , it also provides the principal economic income of Tuskegee 's merchants . In the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church last week , a stomping , whistling crowd of 2,900 Negroes heard Professor Charles G. Gomillion , 57 , dean of students at the institute and president of the Tuskegee Civic Association , lay out a strategy for fighting back without violence . " We will buy goods and services only from those who will recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note reminiscent of Montgomery 's Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , Gomillion cautioned : " Please refrain from boasting , betting or accepting bribes . Soon the time will come when they the whites will have to respect us . They may hate our guts , but they will respect us . We can hold out longer than they . We can form our own businesses if necessary . We will continue as long as we have to . " <P> Potent Response . Next day the boycott was on . At Tuskegee 's big Veterans Administration Hospital , which , together with the institute , pumps an , estimated $9,000,000 a year into Tuskegee 's economy , some 2,000 employees-mostly Negroes-got their bimonthly paychecks . Few cash registers jingled in town : for Tuskegee 's white merchants it was the worst " payroll Wednesday " in years . At week 's end tight-lipped shopkeepers admitted that the boycott was about 90% effective among the Negroes , and many merchants were grimly beginning to wonder how long they could hold out .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
