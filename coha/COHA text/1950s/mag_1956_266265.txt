The lecturers in the seminar room of the Menninger Foundation in Topeka , Kans. last week were , naturally , topnotch psychiatrists-Drs . Karl and William Menninger and key members of their staff . The talk was , naturally , about Eros and Thanatos , conscious and preconscious , repression and denial . What was surprising was the student body : 18 men from industry and a woman from a consumers ' group . They had two things in common-they were responsible for the personnel policies of their organizations , and they wanted to know how psychology and psychiatry could help them with their problems . Companies represented ranged from giant A. T. &; T. through Kraft Foods to the Alma Piston Co. of Alma , Mich . <P> Explained Dr. Will Menninger : the foundation is deeply interested in industrial psychiatry ; there are only three full-time and a handful of part-time psychiatrists in U.S. industry today , though 70% or more of all dismissals are the result of " social incompetence , " and only 30% are caused by technical incompetence . <P> The class plunged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Psychiatrist Herbert Modlin ticked off basic personality types , and told how to recognize some of the tricks of the unconscious in employees ' behavior . Examples : a compulsive , conservative accountant may be reacting against childhood impulses to be dirty and rebellious ; an ambitious man may have developed from a passive child , a philanthropist from the bullyboy who tied tin cans to cats ' tails ; an employee oversuspicious of everybody else 's motives may act that way because his own unconscious motives are basically unworthy . A passive and compliant type who will not even ask for a raise may be covering up intolerable aggressions . Dr. Modlin tried to get his students to look at their employees with a diagnostic eye : " If you see a definite change in a worker 's personality traits , the assumption is that he 's reacting to severe stress . . . It 's up to you to find out what it is and try to help him . " <P> Dr. Karl Menninger , author of Man Against Himself and a leading devotee of the death-instinct theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-destructive urges which , in his view , make men accident-prone , absence-prone , and likely to court trouble with the boss . The practical businessmen around the table found the idea of a death instinct a tough nut . Some of them also boggled over the immense importance attached by the experts to the preschool years in character formation . In general , however , they lapped up most of the theory , and brought up case histories to match against it . Samples : <P> The perfectionist worker who procrastinates because he can not make decisions . The prescription was to put him in a set structure with firm deadlines , clearly defined duties and few decisions . <P> An otherwise excellent supervisor who spoils his performance by a bullying lack of tact with subordinates . Since his behavior is adolescent , the prescription was to treat him as an adolescent , with firmness and support , and allow him to let off steam against his own superior with no fear of counterattack.                 @ @ @ @
