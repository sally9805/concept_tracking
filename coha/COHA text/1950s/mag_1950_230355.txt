The British press , much more than the American , is like the little girl with mid-forehead curl . No U.S. yellow journal is worse than Britain 's biggest &; worst , News of the World . But few U.S. newspapers can match the literary quality and accuracy of Britain 's best ( e.g. , the London Times , London Telegraph ) . And in a half-dozen opinionated weeklies , the British press sets a standard , intellectual and literary , that is unmatched elsewhere . <P> A weekly that exemplifies British journalism at somewhere near its literary and critical best and prejudiced worst is the New Statesman and Nation . It is the biggest , orneriest and-in its rear parts-the smoothest of British literary weeklies . Since 1931 , the New Statesman 's circulation has soared from 14,830 to 87,156 ( including 5,000 in the U.S. ) . <P> <P> Maddening Muddle . The New Statesman is beloved , as Editor Kingsley Martin admits , by a " very high percentage of readers who say . . . that they read the front political part last and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a mishmash , an often-maddening muddle of Socialism , appeasement of Russia , and anti-Americanism . On the Korean war the New Statesman has adopted a " plague on both your houses " attitude , and has implied that worldwide Communism would be preferable to an atomic war . <P> The New Statesman 's position as a kind of Chamberlain-of-the-left has endeared it to pacifist-minded intellectuals and greying Socialists who loved Russia in their youth , but it raises the hackles of most leaders of the Labor Party . When Prime Minister Clement Attlee was asked what publication he most disliked , he snapped : " The New Statesman . " <P> Winged Barbs . In the sparkling back-of-the-book sections , directed by Literary Editor Thomas Cuthbert Worsley , surprisingly little of this left-wing fuzziness appears . Worsley , who is also drama critic and chief puzzle-master ( under such pseudonyms as " Thomas Smallbones " ) , leans heavily on a few steadily brilliant contributors : Desmond Shawe-Taylor ( music ) , Patrick Heron ( art ) , G. W. Stonier , who also writes as " William Whitebait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Critic V. S. Pritchett . <P> Though the magazine 's pay is nominal , it has attracted such writers as G. B. Shaw , E. M. Forster , J. B. Priestley , Rebecca West and Elizabeth Bowen . A weekly feature is the barbed verses of Sagittarius ( Olga Katzin , 54 , a housewife who makes daily trips to the cubbyhole London office where she writes her poems ) . Recently , Sagittarius winged the government on the newsprint shortage . Said Sagittarius : <P> A little newsprint , shortly to be less , Outrages and insults the British Press A little muddle makes a pretty mess . <P> Wry Notes . In the column , " This England , " the magazine regularly passes on to readers with an amused smile such deadpan comments on manners &; morals as " The true story of the worst criminal in London 's history . An admirably ghoulish play suitable for all the family . From poster for Shepherd 's Bush Empire . "                   @ @
