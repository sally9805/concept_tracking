The time is 6:30 p.m. , 88 years to the day after anti-Bonapartists raced through the streets of Paris proclaiming the end of Louis Napoleon 's Second Empire and the birth of the Third French Republic . The scene : the Place de la Republique , in the heart of working-class Paris , where only four months ago a quarter of a million Parisians marched in protest against the death of the Fourth Republic and the return to power of Charles de Gaulle . The occasion : with full pomp and calculated circumstance , De Gaulle has come to the Place de la Republique to present officially to the French people the proposed new constitution that would make him the super-President of the Fifth Republic . The general stands on a crimson dais before a 150-ft. gilded " V " draped in the French Tricolor . <P> According to the script prepared with loving care by the men around De Gaulle , the drama unveiled last week in the Place de la Republique was to be a demonstration of popular affection for De Gaulle-a stirring show that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referendum on the new constitution . But when the show finally opened , it flopped . <P> Anticipating trouble with the Communists , who mortally hate and fear De Gaulle and consider the Place de la Republique their own parade ground , the government took such zealous security measures that the ceremony was robbed of all spontaneity and enthusiasm . More than 4,000 police ringed the square ; and only about 10,000 Gaullists with special invitations were permitted near the speakers ' platform . Away back , behind an imposing network of steel barricades manned by police and young Gaullist strongmen , were less-favored citizens of Paris-some 70,000 of them . <P> Balloons &; Boots . Before De Gaulle arrived , police and Communist militants were already fighting in the side streets . Unfazed , the general earnestly began to proclaim the virtues of the new constitution , which he declared is suited " to this century and to the people we are . " His voice breaking with emotion , De Gaulle shouted : " With all my heart , in the name of France , I ask you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he spoke floated a cluster of red , white and blue balloons bearing the single word non . <P> At speech 's end De Gaulle broke into the Marseillaise , and the crowd took up the anthem . Then , apparently troubled by his lack of contact with the audience , De Gaulle descended from the platform . To the consternation of the police protecting him , the general , lost without his glasses , lunged past barriers , mingled with the crowd , smiling and shaking hands . As the crowd headed home , stone-hurling Communists , shouting " Fascism Shall Not Pass , " clashed with club-wielding police . Red-bereted ex-paratroopers , spoiling for a fight with the Reds who had helped spoil the Gaullist show , joined in . Angered by the jeers of leftist mobs , one group of Republican Guards in ceremonial tunics , climbed out of their bus and charged-boots clattering , sabers waving , horsetail plumes flying in the breeze .
