 | German Musical Life : Patterns of Conservatism and Experiment 1 . Music is the Germans ' favorite art , and their approach to it has never been more aptly put than in the motto once adorning one of their most famous concert halls : . " Res severa verum gaudium " ( " Serious matters are the real fun " ) . The hall , the old Gewandhaus in Leipzig , has shared the fate of most German concert halls and opera houses : it was destroyed in World War II . Yet the spirit of its inscription lives on . The Germans consume serious and sternly symphonic music as passionately as the Italians love the sweet art of bel canto . Since the nineteenth century , since Schopenhauer , Wagner , and Nietzsche , knowledge and appreciation of music have been considered prime cultural factors in Germany ; some musical training is still a required part of higher education . Before 1933 , musical Germany stood open to the world . Diversity and cosmopolitan tolerance were the rule ; perfection was the only yardstick . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " self-sufficient , " i.e. , excluded from international competition . The drastic consequences did not show in full until the gates to the world were reopened in 1945 . Even now Germany has not made up her loss of substance in all fields of music ; even now her younger generation houses ? more than exist in all @# the rest of the world . About a dozen of these are first-class theaters , half of them well known abroad , where tours have won them wide recognition . Their styles and techniques of performance vary enormously , and their repertories run the gamut from classic and romantic opera to the experiments of our time , depending on the artistic leanings of the men in charge . An institution such as the Munich State Opera holds fast to its traditions of cultivating Wagner and Richard Strauss , along with Mozart , and of collecting great voices . ( In Munich the old Nationaltheater was destroyed , but the Prinzregententheater has been preserved . ) At the Hamburg State Opera , on the other hand , a moderninclined director , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very modern repertory : Benjamin Britten 's Peter Grimes was first performed there in a makeshift theater seating six hundred , and the opening week of the new house in October 1955 featured a work as daring as Ernst Krenek 's Pallas Athena Weeps . Heinz Tietjen , head of the West Berlin City Opera until 1954 , combined due attention to Wagnerian music-drama with a broad policy of moderate modernism . He successfully staged Honegger 's Joan of Arc at the Stake , Werner Egk 's Circe and his Abrams ballet , and overcame the widespread opposition to the social criticism contained in Boris Blather 's Prussian Fairy Tale . East Berlin has two separate music theaters , the State Opera and the Comic Opera . Tradition as well as the cultural policies of the Soviet occupying power have kept the State Opera repertory conservative , though Alban Berg 's Wozzeck was brilliantly staged there in December 1955 to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of its first performance . The Comic Opera under Walter Felsenstein , one of 167  | Germany 's outstanding operatic directors , presents whatever does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magic Flute to Carl Orff 's The Clever One , from Weber 's Freischittz to Richard Mohaupt 's Hostess of Pinsk , from Rossini 's Barber to Richard Strauss 's The Silent Woman , from Offenbach 's Orpheus to Johann Strauss 's Die Fledermaus . Some Felsenstein productions ? of Leos Janacek 's Sly Fox , for instance ? are model achievements . In the West modern operas have been staged with distinction in Cologne and Essen , while Stuttgart under its conductor Ferdinand Leitner has become a showcase of dramatic voices . As such it has worked closely with the Bayreuth Festival : Wieland Wagner , the artistic guiding spirit of Bayreuth , presents his frequently sensational productions both there and in Stuttgart . Some theaters bear the imprint of a conductor 's personality ? Georg Solti 's in Frankfurt , Eugen Szenkar 's in Dusseldorf , and until recently , Hermann Abendroth 's in Weimar . Others maintain or revive such local traditions as the Handel renaissance in Halle . Many cities ? Hamburg , Dusseldorf , Essen , Mannheim , Kassel , East Berlin ? have built large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet , however outwardly promising the state of German opera may seem , inwardly it is critical . The very success abroad of its singers , conductors , and directors has brought a discontinuity to their work that can not but affect the ensemble spirit and the growth of the repertory . Policy today is often dictated by stars according to their schedules . If Herr Tristan ? long under guest contract only ? is home in March , Fraulein Isolde flies to Buenos Aires or San Francisco ; when she is in the country , Tristan has a recording date in London . 2 CONCERT life is centered more and more in the great orchestras and their conductors . Chamber music and solo concerts , once dominant , are now rare ; only the large choral organizations are still going strong , chiefly in the song-loving Rhenish and South German cities . In Berlin , Munich , Hamburg , Leipzig , Cologne , and Frankfurt the traditional philharmonic subscription concerts go on virtually unchanged . The concert cycles of the Berlin Philharmonic , for example , run from September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brahms , Bruckner , and Tchaikovsky , with some Schubert , Schumann , Ilaydn , Mozart , Bach , and Richard Strauss thrown in as accessories . More modern works are cautiously interspersed , unrequested by the subscribers . Under Herbert von Karajan , Wilhelm Furtwangler 's successor at the helm of the Berlin Philharmonic , the repertory remained almost the same , and the other German " traditional orchestras " ? Hamburg , for instance , under Joseph Kellberth 's leadership , or Cologne , where young Gun- ther Wand cultivates the tradition of the Gurzenich concerts ? follow an almost identical pattern . Since 1945 , however , broadcasting has led to the creation of new symphony orchestras that offer stiff competition to the old ones . Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt in Hamburg , Hans Rosbaud in Baden-Baden , Eugen Jochum in Munich , Hans Muller-Kray in Stuttgart , and others in Cologne , Frankfurt , Berlin , Leipzig , are now leading such orchestras which aim at ? and occasionally achieve ? the American ideal of technical perfection . In Baden-Baden , Cologne , and Munich , above all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two most active institutions dedicated to contemporary music , Karl Amadeus Hart mann 's Musica Viva in Munich and Dr. Herbert Hubner 's Dens neue Werk in hamburg , would be unthinkable without the financial backing of the radio stations and the co-operation of their new orchestras . The avant-garde music festivals held in Donaueschingen similarly depend on the Baden-Baden Radio , its orchestra , and its musical director , Dr. Heinrich Strobel . Besides the orchestras , the radio choirs and chainber choirs also have become precision instruments for the presentation of very modern and very ancient music . With classicism and especially romanticism ? i.e. all music written between 1750 and 1900 ? turning into a private preserve of the conservative audience and its orchestras and choirs , the interest of new listeners has focused on preclassicism and modernism . Thus we have today two kinds of audiences for serious music , aside from the special audience for jazz which is the same the world over . In 1949 Germany buried Richard Strauss and Hans Pfitzner , the two great exponents of her late romanticism . Strauss , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only contemporary admitted to the programs of conservative concert life . Paul Hindemith , approaching him in international renown , had left Germany in 1937 and moved to the United States in 1940 . When the Nazi ban on his music was lifted in 1945 , his works soon topped the performance figures of modern music ; but Hindemith himself returned only as a guest . Like Thomas Mann , he preferred to make his home in Switzerland . Of the moderns whose work dates back to about 1920 , a few survived the Hitler era in Germany . Philipp Jarnach , a leading member of Ferruccio Busoni 's school which also includes Wladimir Vogel and hurt Weill , has withdrawn to the ivory tower of the Hamburg Academy of Music . His few works ? a number of songs and a string quartet movement ? combine romantic beauty with classic form . Heinz Tiessen lives in Berlin ; his songs , piano pieces , and chamber music works continue a tempered expressionism whose historic significance will be as obvious to future generations as that of Jarnach 's romantic classicism. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm of church music : the Heger pupil Josef Haas of Munich , equally successful with his Catholic oratorio Saint Elizabeth and with his folk operas Tobias Wunderlich and Job 's Wedding ; and the Rhinelander Ernst Pepping , who lives now in Berlin and independently carries on the great Protestant tradition in his Passion According to Saint Matthew . A postwar discovery is Karl Amadeus Hartmann of Munich , born in 1905 and successful since 1946 . His style freely follows the German expressionist line ; his music , based on that of Mahler , on Schonberg 's middle period , and on Alban Berg , has recently acquired elements of Stravinsky 's concerto manner and of the " variable metrics " developed by Boris Blocher . Hartmann , alone among the progressive composers , has striven in six major works for a symphonic style and symphonic forms ; but his chamber music and his opera The Youth of Simplicius Simplicissimus also mark him as an imaginative exponent of a polyphonic style not bound by tonality . The successors of Bruckner have produced an organ master and eminent symphonist : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has developed an archaic construct ivism based upon the old church scales and using thematic inversion , augmentation , and diminution as effectively as his twelve-tone antagonists. 3 THE change in present style from the period between the two wars shows in the symphonic thinking of the new German composers . If it was then customary to write in the spirit of the baroque concerto grosso ? on one theme , without development , by contrasts the trend has now been reversed and the symphonic ideal has come back to the fore . Mahler and Bruckner are the signposts , not Corelli or Handel . The contributors to the symphonic renaissance in this sense include so progressive a composer as Wolfgang Fortner as well as younger men like H. W. Henze and Giselher Klebe . Fortner , one of the most interesting figures of the generation now in its fifties , clearly embodies t lie evolution of German music from 1930 to 1950 . Under Hitler he wrote in Hindemith 's manner , like many progressives ; after 1945 his style remained at first a mixture of Hindemith 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works of Schonberg , Alban Berg , and Anton von Webern , and revised his composing technique and musical style . In this revision the bulk of the younger German composers took part ; their show place is the Internationale Ferienkurse fur nene JCusil ; , held since 1946 by Dr. Wolfgang Steinecke at the Hessian castle of Kranichstein , and later at the former Isadora Duncan school of Marienhohe near Darmstadt . There the young people heard their first works of the Schonberg school . In 1948 Rene Leibowitz came to Darmstadt to proclaim the message of uncompromising dodecaphony ? of " serial " composition in series of twelve tones , none of which is repeated , and whose sequence varies only according to the three possibilities of ordering : inversion , recurrence , and retrograde inversion . Influential lecturers at Darmstadt , besides Leibowitz , were Ernst Krenek , Edgar Varese , Olivier Messiaen , and Alois Haba . Shortly before his shift toward the twelve-tone technique Fortner had written a symphony of imposing formal conception and expressive power , with a fourth movement climaxed by highly dissonant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to French existentialist influences . Later important dodecaphonic works of his were the B-A-C-H Fantasy , the Cello Sonata ? with interesting links to the medieval music of Guillaume de Machault ? and the White Rose ballet based upon Oscar Wilde 's Birthday of the Infanta . Operatic fragments after Lorca 's Blood Wedding also show Fortner 's expressive language at its best . Fortner teaches composition in Detmold , and his influence is probably exceeded only by that of the head of the Berlin Academy of Music , Boris Blacher . Born in 1903 , Blacker is now one of Germany 's most original and prolific composers . Of his recent orchestral works the most brilliant and successful are the Paganini Variations on the famous , often varied A-minor thence ; but his dry , unadorned personal style shows up even better in his two piano concertos . The second uses Blather 's own " variable meters . " In this new metric plan the classic time pattern has been replaced by continual time changes ? not , however , employed irrationally ( as in Stravinsky 's Sucre du printemps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) but after arithmetical models . Thus one of Blather 's Ornaments begins with the expanding time sequence : 2/8 , 3/8 , 4/8 , 5/8 , 6/8 , 7/8 , 8/8 , 9/8 , which is followed by the contracting one : 8/8 , 7/8 , 6/8 , 5/8 , etc . Blacker also goes in for twelve-tone composing , as in his ballets Lysistrata , Hamlet , and The Moor of Venice . Opera , at which composers of all generations labor with slight success , has been most strongly affected by the modern evolution . Since the classic and romantic periods European musical style has become more and more instrumental , and since the beginning of the twentieth century , instrumentally polyphonic . Today you can no more compose a naiively melodious vocal opera than a rhetorical drama it la Wagner , Pfitzner , or Strauss . The very form and spirit of opera have been called in quest ion . Werner Egk ( born in 1901 ) is one of the most successful of the older composers , but in 1948 his Circe did not come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his Irish Legend was produced in  | Salzburg , it proved to be a musical disappointment . The followers of Carl Orff constitute a large sect in the realm of German dramatic music . This inventive Bavarian dramatist plans for a mysticcultistic revival of the musical stage . His Antigone , using the Sophoclean theme in Friedrich Holderlin 's somber translation , is the representative work of the school . It makes of music a mere accessory to dramatic effect , something like a painted stage prop . There are exotic elements in Orff 's deliberately infantile musical language ; there is monotonous recitative ; there is an orchestra for a rhythmic and dynamic accompaniment , with several harps , pianos , xylophones , and a large percussion section . They seem intended to demonstrate how far the drama outweighs every other artistic expression . It is only in the narrow framework of scenic effect that Orff can be credited with musical creative power ; all of his works are useful objects of the stage setting , musically effective wherever there is a naive reaction to sensual impressions . Boris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong sense of the dramatic , tries to revitalize the allegedly exhausted operatic form by introducing ballet and oratorio-style modifications . His most successful stage work ? aside from the much older Princess Tarakanova ? was the ballet opera , Prussian Fairy Tale , in which he used the grotesque theme of The Captain of Kopenick to try out a new , highly individual language along lines somewhere between Offenbach and Stravinsky . Hartmann 's Youth of Simplicius Simplicissimus came from the epic theater in the spirit of Bertolt Brecht . Brecht himself joined with the composer Paul Dessau in producing The Trial of Lucullus at the East Berlin State Opera in 1951 : a mixture of opera and play , employing aria , chorus , spoken dialogue with musical accompaniment , and recitative in a functional manner to intensify and accentuate moments of action . r i o TEE generation born after 1920 , the tw lvetone law became a similar collective experience to the young painters ' abstraction from the objective world . From about 1948 on , composition turned away from all neo-classicist tendencies toward a formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " serial " ordering of all elements of music . The eclipse of tonality must be accepted as inevitable , a historic fact , despite attempts to circumvent it . In place of tonality we either have old and exotic scales or we have " series , " new forms established individually for each work . Series are primarily melodic figures , tone sequences that are maintained throughout a composition ; but the same fixation can be applied to rhythms , to dynamic marks , to timbres . There are rhythmic series in the medieval ars nova , and dynamic and timbre " series " in Anton von Webern 's late works . Today this serial thinking kindles the imagination of many young composers . Three may be mentioned as typical : Hans Werner Henze , Giselher Klebe , and Karlheinz Stockhausen . All three , however different their eventual directions , tend to make composing totally fixed and methodical . Henze , born in 1925 in Westphalia and a student of Fortner and Leibowitz , is the richest artistic personality of the trio , a composer as facile as Hindemith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber music and cantatas , the sublime alternates with the ridiculous , and experiment with imitation . His second opera , Boulevard Solitude , has set off many controversies ; a modern version of the Manon Lescaut theme , it employs both surrealist and naturalistic scenic means and tries for a musical synthesis of dodecaphony and tonal melody . Even more consistent in its turn to vocal melody is Henze 's new opera , King Stag , first performed at the Berlin Festival in 1956 . There he draws with prodigal imagination on the wealth of all modern style media and composing techniques , and the union of Italian delight in song and a tonally free , serially bound construction brings forth a new sound , deeply romantic in effect . Giselher Klebe , born in 1926 in Mannheim , lives in Berlin and studied with Blacher and Josef Rufer . He produces much more slowly and cautiously than Henze . His music is polyphonic and often very methodically constructed , his tonal imagination leans toward the eccentric . His short orchestral work , The Twittering Machine , was inspired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de force of ultimate thought compression . In a symphony , Klebe tried to contrast the principles of metamorphosis and variation , with the glissando serving as thematic idea , so to speak . His music " glides " into spaces of sound lying outside our tonal system . This experiment , forecast in the works of Bartok and Messiaen , has never been carried out with the relentlessness and with the daemonic effect achieved by Klebe . He is a musician interested in philosophy and inclining to all sorts of metaphysical speculation . Recently he attracted attention with a large dramatic scene , Raskolnikov 's Dream ? based upon Dostoevski ? for soprano , clarinet , and orchestra . At present he is working on an opera based upon Schiller 's drama , The Bandits , for which his two ballets , Signals and Fleurenville , may be regarded as preliminary studies . Wholly experimental is the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen , born in 1928 in Altenberg , near Cologne , who studied with Frank Martin , went to Messiaen in Paris , took part briefly in the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic methods of Herbert Eimert in Cologne . Technically , his compositions are derived from Anton von Webers s athematic pointillism . Such  | works as his Cross Play , the Play for Orchestra that was performed at Donaueschingen in 1952 , and Counterpoints , offered at the 1953 Cologne Festival , represent a new type of music . At first Stockhausen 's anti-vocal oscillographic style , his aesthetic of atomizing discontinuity , evoked bafflement and icy rejection . The underlying ideas are as confused as they are basically right . The experimental state of these works is undeniable ; much of it ? as in the similar compositions of Italy 's Luigi Nono and France 's Pierre Boulez ? points toward a creative dehumanization . The logical result was to entrust this music to electronic instruments , and finally to turn composing into an electronic montage process . The circle around Herbert Eimert in Cologne stands in sharp opposition to the Parisian musique concrete ; instead of registering natural sounds and tones , it works exclusively with pure simple oscillations ( " sine tones " ) and tone mixtures that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something monkish and magnificent about the militant zeal with which the Eimert school defends its methods . Like all monasticism , however , the movement tends to lose touch with the world and to strangle its own vitality . Looking at the diagrams and graphs which Stockhausen publishes in lieu of musical notation , one is scared by so much algebra and mental reservation . For traditionally trained musicians his book is unreadable ; one has to study systems of co-ordinates so as to get an approximate notion of sound . But the effort will have to be made , and though the resulting music will soon leave the listener in a state of aural fatigue , there is no denying its strong , new artistic effect . It was one of the surprises of spring 1956 that the Eimert school ? technically and financially @# supported by the Cologne Radio ? brought out two works combini*g electronic with vocal sound . The two composers who dared to bridge the gulf between tone apparatus and human voice were Stockhausen and Ernst Krenek . Both chose Scriptural texts . Stockhausen entrusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furnace to a single boy 's voice , with the sound now pure , now altered , multiplied , technically distorted , forced through all sorts of acoustic sieves as it pours from five loudspeakers scattered about the hall . The work is intemperate , often bizarre , but it does have an immediate impact . Aesthetically still quite surrealistic , it adds a spatial effect , a stereophonic element , and space , after all , is the domain of music . These new experiments were presented also at the annual Darmstadt Festivals , which have maintained their position as the principal European testing ground of modern music . There , it would seem important to give a hearing to others than Webern followers and rationalizing constructivists ? especially important in view of the new threat of a twelve-tone academicism , a pseudo-modern philistinism . The German tendency to systematize , to overstress the res severa and forget the verum gaudium , has turned " serial " composing into a facile nostrum which now enjoys the mass distribution that Hindemith 's canonic technique had in the 1930 's . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative talent , of the younger generation feels drawn to the serial technique and has come at least temporarily under its spell . That there are ways leading from such systematism to a new vocal concept seems as much evidenced by Stockhausen 's latest composition as by Henze 's King Stag , which demonstrates it on the operatic stage . @#
