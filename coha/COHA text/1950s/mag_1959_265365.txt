On the Senate floor of the State Capitol in Richmond one day last week-some 98 years after Virginia voted 88-55 to secede from the Union-there were moments when it seemed that the senator from the Appomattox District wanted to secede again . Proclaimed Senator Charles T. Moses , waving a portrait of Robert E. Lee astride Traveller : " That 's the man for states ' rights ! He did n't surrender ! He just walked in to see General Grant , gave his hat to a courier and said , ' We 're out of food ! ' " The occasion : the diehards of U.S. Senator Harry Byrd 's powerful political machine , aware that the state 's massive resistance laws had collapsed , and that Governor J. Lindsay Almond Jr . was making points with a local-option plan , were determined to rough up Almond in a rearguard action . <P> <P> Governor Almond , who had bowed with courage and dignity in accepting token integration as inevitable ( TIME , Feb. 9 ) , staked his power on a new program drawn up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr . The key bill would return pupil placement to local school boards , subject to rules set by the state board of education . In the final vote , minutes after Appomattox ' Moses waved the picture of Lee , the Almond forces carried the day by 21-18 . The house passed the senate version , 63-23 . <P> Virginia gentleman and astute politician that he is , Lindsay Almond in victory pooh-poohed any notion of a split with the venerable Byrd organization-and went out of his way to shake hands with the diehards . But Virginians could hardly help noticing that as the Old Dominion turned away from Byrd 's disastrous massive resistance policies , Lindsay Almond was very much in command .
