" Our slogan , " cried Prime Minister Robert Menzies in his booming campaign voice , " is Australia Unlimited , and we pronounce it with confidence . " But for all their leader 's enthusiasm , it was with something short of unlimited confidence that the members of Australia 's Liberal-Country coalition government approached last week 's elections to the Senate and the House . In the nine years since he was swept into office on an anti-Socialist wave , the Prime Minister has given his country prosperity , has whipped rising inflation , boosted pensions , introduced a national health service , proved a stout friend of the U.S. and Britain . But stolid , unimaginative Bob Menzies himself has never been personally popular . His chronic testiness ( " He must be drunk or paid to come here as a pest , " he angrily shouted at a heckler ) has not helped him much . When his car was spattered with eggs in Sydney , even the usually progovernment Melbourne Herald blandly refused to remonstrate . " At election time , " it said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is almost obligatory . " <P> If Menzies faced a difficult time , the Laborites had their troubles too . Right-wing Laborites ( mostly Roman Catholic ) have long criticized Party Leader Herbert Evatt , 64 , for his easygoing attitude toward Communists in unions . They formed their own splinter group , the Democratic Labor Party . <P> Last week , as 5,400,000 voters trooped to the polls to cast their compulsory ballots ( penalty for not voting : 2 ) , Sydney 's Sun-Herald sourly editorialized : " The electors have a poor choice . " Labor 's divided condition helped give Menzies a majority in the House , and a gain of from two to four seats in the Senate .
