 | How to Get Rid of Household Insect Pests By C. Lester Walker The reader 's Digest asked York Research Corporation of F ford , Conn. , official products testers for the American Hotel Association , to investigate the whole object of household insects and their eradication . This report is based on the laboratory 's findings . The most effective and practicable killer of the various insects which often infest a home is chlorine . This is a brown , syrupy liquid with a wet-wood smell , whose chemical are chlorine , carbon d hydrogen . Chlordane is the filler ingredient in many commercial insecticides which can be purchased the local hardware store . Ants , cockroaches , silverfish and bedbugs are all killed with about equal effectiveness by chlordane , although its place and manner of application in the house may have to varied depending on the insect it is used against . Ants . To kill ants chlordane should be poured directly into the anthill outdoors , or the ant nest indoors if its location is known . ( An insecticide containing two percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the label when you buy . ) Then with a two-inch brush paint a ribbon of chlordane around the outside foundation of your house , another ribbon along your floors next to the baseboards , and another across any route over which the ants regularly track food . Cockroaches . When used against cockroaches chlordane should be applied especially along and in the crevices formed by corners and baseboards , along water pipes , sinkcounter edges and the darkened areas under refrigerators , washing machines , and so on . A handy way to get it into these places is by use of a mechanic 's oilcan with long spout bent at the tip , from which it can be squirted . Equally important in cockroach eradication is absolute cleanliness and absence of dampness as in the  | cellar or where sweaty water pipes moisten dark cupboard corners under the kitchen sink . And no food scraps should be left around , in kitchen garbage pail or on sink drainboard , at any time . Silverfish ( which eat almost anything in the way of fabrics and paper which have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bedbugs ( which can get into the cleanest of houses ) will be killed off if the places they romp over are chlordane-treated . For both insects , the insecticide should be painted around window casings , baseboards , water-pipe entrances ; and , especially against bedbugs , around cracks in the plaster , edges of loosened wallpaper and the seams and tufts of your mattresses . Insecticides which contain DDT will also kill cockroaches , silverfish and bedbugs ; but they are not as fastworking , York Research found , as chlordane . Fleas in a house are usually a present from household pets . They feed , breed , lay their eggs and ride around on your dog , cat or hamster . The eggs shake off onto the floor and hatch out as larvae , which feed on floor-crack lint or any debris in your rugs . When the larvae grow to adult fleas they hop back onto a nearby pet , or infest places like the creases of upholstery . From here they go to work on you . First burn the straw , blanket or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? five percent strength ? in the doghouse , basket or other sleeping place . Next dust Rover with DDT powder , brushing it in along spine and sides . Do n't , however , use DDT directly on a cat . If she licks it , it may make her ill . Instead , dust her with pyrethrum powder . Never use oilsolution pesticides on any animal ; they are absorbable by the skin and may do harm . If the fleas have got into your mattresses , sofas or upholstered chairs , paint the edges , cracks and pockets thoroughly with a five percent DDT solution . If this does n't work , have the infested articles commercially fumigated . Clothes Moths lay eggs and the larvae hatch out in any month of the year in warm-enough surroundings . The larvae eat furs , any fabric of animal origin , and other material in spots where it is soiled by any animal fat , such as gravy , butter or soup . Chlordane is death to both the moth and the larvae . It should be painted around all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are already moth-infested it should be sprayed on . Fumes from old-fashioned moth balls or moth flakes , if made of naphthalene or paradichlorobenzene and used in a fairly airtight enclosure , will eventually kill both moth eggs and grubs . But at least one pound of flakes or crystals ( ten pounds of moth balls ) must be used for every hundred cubic feet of space . The  | dispensing container should hang war the ceiling ; the vapors , heavier than air , settle floorward . Some of the time-hallowed antimoth measures for clothes storage ne virtually worthless . Printer 's ink , for instance , will not kill moths ; so do n't rely on wrapping clothes in newspapers . Camphor wo n't kill l o t hs , nor will oil of pine or oil of cedar . Chests lined with a thin veneer of cedar wood are of little or no use , although a chest which is all heartwood red cedar and tightly made will protect . But more effective , York Research reported , is any tight wooden chest , if layers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **27;635;TOOLONG . Ask for it by this name 11 drugstore or hardware store . You can also use your quick-freezer . A temperature of 0 ? Fahrenheit kills moths and larvae within 48 hours . Furs or clothing scaled in a polyethylene bag ( the cellophanelike material all freezer owners use ) and left about 6o hours in the sub ' zero freezing compartment can be taken out and stored , still in the bag , with no further worry over moths . Do Mothproofers Mothproof ? t o find out , York Research tested 14 leading mothproofing compounds . " Although many of the compounds might be termed satisfyingly effective over a limited period , " warned the laboratory , " there was none which would give absolute and permanent mothproofing . " Tests showed that mothproofing often would n't stand up against dry or wet cleaning . To mothproof at home you spray the materials heavily ( outdoors or in the garage ) with one of the commercial products sold for the purpose . Eight brands classed as Acceptable by the York Laboratory were Bee Brand Insect Spray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Larvex and Resiproofer . There may be others equally good . Carpet Beetles . Big ladybug size , these pests arc black or mottled black-and-brown , and in many regions do more damage to clothes than do clothes moths . You can detect their presence by the castoff skins their larvae leave behind . Best protection against them , reports York Research , is prevention : i.e. , have articles regularly treated with mothproofing . If carpet beetles already infest rugs or clothing , you need a quick killer . " Then use chlordane-content insecticide . Spray rugs on both sides , spray floor cracks and baseboards . Use a coarse-stream spray , not a finely atomized one . Do Pesticides Poison People ? Any substance which will kill an insect can be dangerous to a human being . In sufficient quantity , some can he lethal . Properly used , however , bug-killers are not dangerous . Follow these few rules for safety : 1 . Do n't use too strong in any form . DDT is dangerous over five percent , chlordane over two per-  | cent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any form . 2 . Whenever you can , use liquid rather than spray or dust . Liquids subject the user to less exposure . 3 . Although they are sometimes difficult to obtain , try to use water emulsions or mixtures rather than oil solutions ( the label will tell you ) . Oil solutions are more toxic , may kill house plants , and are usually highly flammable . 4 . If you use a spray , cover up all equipment used in connection with food , and work-surfaces where food is prepared or served . 5 . If you spray or dust for any length of time , better wear gloves , mask and goggles . Always wash thoroughly after using any insecticide . How to Buy . Brand-name pesticides are usually a small quantity of insect-killer mixed with a large quantity of inert matter . It is best , therefore , to buy not by the brand name but by contents . Shop for the product on which the label states the separate percentages of the active and inactive ingredients . Then you can get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you require as well as your money 's worth .
