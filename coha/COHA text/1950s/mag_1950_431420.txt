YOU are standing on the cramped bridge of a light carrier . Crowded around you are the Skipper , the watch officers , talkers , air officers , the Admiral commanding this Hunter-Killer Force , and some of his staff . On the flight deck , a couple of narrow ladders below you , plane pushers are respotting aircraft at once familiar and strange : torpedo-bombers like the faithful old Grummans , but looking like bullfrogs with grossly swollen housings for search gear . Down another ladder , men in the constant twilight of the information center watch their scopes and plot their dope . Topside , it is a bright tropical day , but your eyes are heavy from the strain of round-the-clock operations . In ASW ? AntiSubmarine Warfare ? the hounds share the nerve-wracking jumpiness of the fox . Off the beams and the bows , the destroy- ers weave their wakes . Overhead , planes drone across , flags whip in the wind , the radar rotates monotonously . And under you , somewhere in all that water , is an " enemy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shove it along under water about as fast as you can go on the surface . With a snorkel to let it breathe for recharging without surfacing . At your elbow , a squawk box begins to blat . One of the search planes , patterning the endless ocean , has caught a scent . A blimp swoops over to investigate with surprising agility : 70 knots is very fast a few feet off the water . Then comes the call for a killer , and a destroyer closes in like a cowboy . Up comes the sub ; a sleek steel shark , and you realize how near it was to getting your carrier , nerve center and home base of the whole H-K force . That 's the way it is in the maneuvers ? sometimes . The deadly guppy-snork can be caught and killed ? when weather and water favor the hunter-killers . But find- ing and fighting the modern submarine is as difficult as it is important in the face of the facts . ASW is as darkly secret a business as the deep , black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigged for dive . But it is a very public secret that : 1 ) ship for ship , in the brutal economics of undersea warfare the odds are again with the subs ; 2 ) the latest German subs could have operated successfully against the detection and killing devices that had swept the old types from the seas ; 3 ) the latest German torpedoes had range and speed beyond the capacity of detection equipment ; and 4 ) Russia thus has the makings of a potent undersea navy . The modern submarine ( PS , June ' 49 , p. 98 ) can travel far , lug missiles and maybe A-bombs . Dr. Vannevar Bush calls it " one of our greatest potential enemies " because it can " cut the world apart . " The Navy knows it as a devil 's wager at such unhappy odds in men , money , and materiel that it can not be won head-on . So it is proper to ask , " How good is our anti-sub defense ? " The honest answer to this simple question is not simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly summarized , as of now , by saying , " only fairly good ? but getting better . " That represents an improvement . A while back , the answer could have been a grim , " Oh , brother ! " Today there is not only a new attitude toward the importance of the problem in the Pentagon . In the Navy itself , there is a broader approach , planned to draw on the best in civilian science as well as operational experience . Of course , you should know that to ask , " How good is our anti-sub defense ? " is a little like asking , " How much is an automobile ? " The answer must carry such question marks as , " How much automobile , and how much money ? " What Will You Pay for a Dead Sub ? Want to kill a submarine ? Sure ! Can do . But how much are you willing to spend ? Want to swap a carrier with 700 men for a sub with 70 ? Remember that a sub can bite , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fast that the first antisub alarm might be a sinking ship . Killing the sub , furthermore , is just part of ASW . It begins , like the recipe for hunter 's stew , with , " First catch your rabbit . . Today 's sub-hunting still centers around the nervy little Hunter-Killer Force that bloomed the seas in World War 11 . It is composed of a carrier , several destroyers , and assorted aircraft . The carrier is not the tin jeep used for ASW in the war , but a tougher , faster fiat-top . The kind they first adapted from tanker hulls , like the Mindoro , Siboney , and Sicily . Or it may be on a cruiser hull , like the Saipan . Whatever the hull , it is stripped and streamlined for speed , with  | a Combat Information Center specialized for sub-hunting and fighting , and the latest thing in radar . The destroyers are faster and lighter on their feet . Off with some topside armament ; on with aluminum superstructure to cut weight . New hunter and killer DDs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carpenter and the Owens.The light cruiser Norfolk has been converted into the first HK of cruiser size and speed . These are the specialized snorkel hounds . The aircraft , too , are becoming more specialized . Some have the emphasis on search ; others on weapons for killing . TBMs and Douglas Skyraiders , bloated with radar or bristling with rockets , depth charges , and torpedoes , are carrier-based . Often the HK Force may collaborate with such land-based , long-search big planes as the P2V Neptune . A possible new helper may be the Martin P5M-1 , the heavy-hulled flying boat designed for ASV operation . A legitimate guess is that this aircraft would be able to squat on the wet almost anywhere and listen for subs .  | The blimps have a bigger job in the Hunter-Killer Force ( PS , July ' 49 , p. 124 ) . Now carrier-based , they can fly out with full detection equipment to extend the fleet 's ears . And fly low and slow enough to use fine-tooth search gear at peak efficiency . The helicopter is a logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finecombing much like the blimps . And its ability to hover could come in handy for putting down advance listening posts . The anti-sub sub ( SSK ) is one of the best shots in the Navy 's ASW locker . You can set a sub to catch a sub quite successfully , as proved by the record of Jap subs sunk by ours . A sub quietly listening can hear farther than a moving enemy sub whose speed clouds his own sonar . Our new guppies are getting high-power detection equipment to let them go on the prowl . And new killer subs are being built . But the SSK will hardly dare work too intimately with the HK force until somebody finds a way for a friendly sub to identify itself without exposing itself . With no way to yell , " Do n't shoot , Joe , it 's me ! " the SSK will have to keep away from the local area of the Hunter-Killers . These are the craft the Navy uses ? under , on , and over the sea ? to find and fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare . The German Type 21 , you remember , had at least doubled the eight-to-ten knot submerged speed of the old subs . This meant it could make more than one swift pass at a convoy , or walk away from hunters that had to slow down to hear better . The German 45-knot torpedo could be fired from five or six miles , far beyond sonar range under the best conditions even today . So what about sonar ? Sonar equipment comes in two main types : what might be called " passive " sonar , which simply listens for undq water noise and indicates direction ; and " active " sonar , which sends out a supersonic pulse called a " ping . " The ping bounces off a target much like radar , and the newest type presents information on a screen . Since sonar protection is outranged by existing torpedoes , the Navy has met the problem differently . As Rear Admiral C. B. Momsen , head of the working party whose chore it has been to plan undersea warfare , puts it : " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new torpedo range , then we must project the platform , just as the airplane projected the gun platform . " The platform from which detection works can be pushed out with the sonobuoy , the blimp , probably the helicopter , and the anti-sub sub that can range discreetly ahead of the Hunter-Killers as a ' forward listening post . Buoy Buggy Whip Blabs on Subs The sonobuoy is an expendable , batterypowered baby broadcasting station . Dropped into suspect waters by plane or blimp , it lowers a microphone , snaps up a little buggy-whip antenna , and blabs what it hears . Monitored by aircraft , a pattern of sonobuoys can keep a sub under surveillance until surface craft can carry on the chase with sonar . Pinging sonar is the most accurate closein detection method . The trouble is that it 's too close . But the blimp promises a valuable projection of the platform . The blimp also carries another detection gimmick : MAD ? Magnetic Airborne Detection ? that can point the finger at a submerged sub by its distortion of the earth 's magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be tossed around in midair , but it works when it works . During the war , it was the only detection gear that could smell a German sub trying to float with the tide , quietly submerged , through  | the Straits of Gibraltar . A sharp eye can see the MAD " birds " perched forward on the bag of a blimp , like ears . The sub-hunters also rely heavily on radar . Improved models in ships and aircraft can catch even the small target of a snorkel . A snorkeling sub presumably has its radar detector going , too , so the very presence of ship and airborne radar over an area is a fine way to keep the subs down or out . These are the main detection devices that can find the elusive and powerful new subs . But once you 've scented your rabbit ( and remember , it 's a man-eating rabbit ! ) how do you kill it ? The " hedgehog " ? so named in wartime code for its many deadly bristles ? is one of your weapons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinned down by killer planes , the destroyers can start shooting with hedgehogs . Hunting with Rocket Shotguns These forward-throwing weapons shoot a shotgun pattern of rocket-propelled charges ahead of or alongside the killer ship while it still has the running fox on sonar plotting . The many high-powered charges sink swiftly , and when one hits a sub it hits hard . If you know your weapons , you can wonder about the possibility of more and bigger hedgehog projectiles fixed up with noses like a VT fuse ( see cover ) . The acoustical torpedo , fitted with homing nose , is known to have existed .  | Released by destroyer , aircraft , or SSK , it avoids its friends by a pressure switch set to explode it only between a predetermined underwater floor and ceiling . Airborne rockets , with a solid steel head that can slam through one side of a sub and out the other , can take care of any guppysnork that might have to surface . Even with all this search and shooting gear , the Hunter-Killer Force is not likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It risks so much in that " devil 's wager . " A carrier , at least six destroyers , two to four blimps ( too far from shore to fly home if their carrier goes down ) , maybe 20 or 30 airplanes also dependent on the carrier . More and more , shore-based planes and tough new seaplanes will probably take up the task of general search-and-kill . The Hunter-Killer Force , however , will have to take on the risky job of guarding the big , slow convoys that must always move the huge supplies for global war . One hard conclusion is visible : no single gadget like sonar , which made us overconfident at the outset of World War II , will again be the obvious answer to ASW . From now on , our anti-sub defense depends on broad development rather than simple discovery . Killing Only Part of Problem In this process , constant and continuing , the actual hunting and killing of the modern submarine becomes only one part of the total problem . Also involved are the survey and selection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hunters than to the subs . Any future ASW operations must take the offensive by mining the waters enemy subs must use , and by blasting the sub pens and construction yards . Even such seemingly extraneous factors as our own cargo-ship construction must be taken into account . You might ask yourself why cargo ships should carry masts and booms and donkey engines for loading , when more modern materials-handling equipment is already available . Stripping off such cumbersome gear would lighten and speed up ships . And cutting down turnaround time would be the quick equivalent of a vastly larger merchant marine . Dockside cranes and loading of whole freight cars , lifted bodily from their wheels , would create more shipping space overnight than could be constructed in many weeks ? or sunk by an enemy in a frightful fraction of construction time . This is only a flash of the total scope of the problem of getting a lot of tonnage across a lot of water . Direct huntin ' , shootin ' anti-sub defense will of course continue as a part of the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation . Warns Dr. Bush , " We need a vigorous program in the hands of a virile and generously supported Navy , in closest cooperation with science and technology throughout the nation . " Thinking Must Come Before Fighting As evidence of its own grasp of the situation , the Navy recently called in Vice Admiral Francis S. Low , ASW chief in World War II , to evaluate needs . There 's now talk of a new committee of working scientists to project the thinking platform . As an example of what is needed in the dreaming stage of detection equipment , consider the single problem of thinking out sonar equipment that will mechanize the peak performance of the best human operators . The way things stand now , even the best operator is wearied by the monotony of listening to the sweeping pings to the point where he loses his sense of audio-discrimination , and may make a fatal mistake . For the sub-hunters , as well as the submariners , must now lean most heavily on the human factor . And as one ASW expert puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the nation with the most rugged musicians .
