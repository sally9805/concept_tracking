Youngstown Steel Door Co. - A pickup in orders during the final six months of 1953 permitted Youngstown Steel Dour Co. to show slightly improved earnings for the full year .

This resulted in early estimates that sales for the first half of the year would about equal those of the like period a year earlier but would be followed by declining shipments in the final six mouths . The pickup in orders , however , permitted the company to show a gain in its backlog for the first time in over two years , and as a result , current backlog is equal to about six months ' production at the present rate . The improvement in earnings reflects to some extent an increase in prices for the company 's output and in part steadier operations throughout the year .
