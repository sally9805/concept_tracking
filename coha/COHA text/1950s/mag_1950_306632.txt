Like most Latin American revolutionary juntas , the team of army majors and lawyers that took charge of El Salvador after last year 's uprising promised the country popular elections . Unlike some other rulers ( notably Venezuela 's and Peru 's ) , the Salvadoran bosses kept their promise . This week , in its first democratic election in almost 20 years , the tiny republic voted for a new President and Congress . Though final results might not be known for a month , short , fat Major Oscar Osorio , 39 , was almost certain to win the presidency . Osorio 's middle-of-the-road Partido Revolucionario de Unificacin Democrtica ( PRUD ) was likely to gain most of the congressional seats . <P> Osorio resigned as junta boss last October to run for elective office . Uncomfortable in civilian clothes , he campaigned from the patio of his cream-colored house in San Salvador , let others take the stump . Shrewd Politico Osorio figured there would not be much to argue about anyway , since coffee prices had soared high enough to please every planter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workers ' vote . <P> The only issue his opponents could dredge up was the old charge that Osorio , whose face resembles the broad , brown Indian features of ex-Dictator Maximiliano Martnez , is in fact Martnez ' illegitimate son . In a country where little stigma is attached to bastardy , this campaign flopped dismally . Osorio denied the charge , explained good-humoredly : " All us Indians look alike . "
