Treasury Secretary George Humphrey took advantage of easier credit conditions last week to borrow some money cheaply and move a step forward in his program of " stretching out " the national debt . He also put the debt within $400 million of the $275 billion ceiling . <P> On sale went $2 billion worth of 2% bonds that mature in eight years instead of short-term securities . To make them attractive to banks , Humphrey made the bonds fully marketable at any time and set the interest rate slightly above the current low market rate on similar bonds , but well below the cost of long-term money last spring . The reception was all he had hoped for : by the end of the first day , the issue was not only sold out , but oversubscribed by $10 billion as investors rushed to buy . <P> Treasury officials still think that they can stay under the debt ceiling until the first of the year . To keep from breaking through the ceiling , the Treasury has already suspended the sale of its savings notes , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as tax reserves . In a pinch , they can cut the number of short-term Treasury bills sold each week ( normally $1.5 billion ) , meet day-to-day expenses by dipping into the Treasury 's $5 billion in cash balance and its $1 billion reserve of gold bullion . But both are only stopgap maneuvers . <P> Early next year , said Budget Director Joseph Dodge , Congress will have to raise the debt limit . In the meantime , said he , the Government could probably borrow beyond the limit because Congress has passed appropriations for the next few years which could easily compel government spending beyond the present debt limit . But , he added , nobody in the Administration wants to do that because " people might not like the bonds . "
