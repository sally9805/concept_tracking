Ever since the 1957 autos swooshed onto the market , with all of their fins , fantails and flanges , they have been the object of an extraordinary amount of comment . Some of it has been admiring , some has been funny , and some-from motorists who want more fish and less fin - has been downright bitter . Last week in the New Republic ( circ. 29,453 ) , Cartoonist Robert Osborn had his say ( see cuts ) with sharp effect . <P> Exurbanite Osborn ( TIME , April 6 , 1953 ) , who personally drives a four-passenger 1951 British-made Riley ( " It 's the most marvelous green color and the wheels are n't square " ) , thinks the 1957 cars are " ludicrous " ( " Why , you ca n't even get into the things " ) . His idea of what a car should be : a cross between a French Bugatti and the 1914 Packard he grew up in . One is beautifully disciplined ; the other , " once you " got in you could walk around in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Detroit can produce an engine as fine as they do , that esthetically their taste , design and judgment are n't worth a damn ? Why , the new models look like great swollen whales ! "
