within this house once  --  but long ago . The earth immediately behind the barn was said by everyone to be extremely rich because of the horses , although there had been none there for over fifty years . Thinking of this soil , which earlier she had eagerly sifted through her fingers , May now realized that she had no wish for the spring to come , no wish to plant a garden , and , branching out at random , she found she had no wish to see the sea again , or children , or favorite pictures , or even her own face on a happy day . For a minute or two , she was almost enraptured in this state of no desire , but then , purged swiftly of her cynicism , she knew it to be false , knew that actually she did have a desire  --  the desire for a desire . And now she felt that she was stationary in a whirlpool , and at the very moment she conceived the notion a bit of wind brought to the seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stood beside it . It crossed her mind that she might consider the wood of the sleigh in its juxtaposition to the living tree and to the horses , who , although they were long since dead , reminded her of their passionate , sweating , running life every time she went to the barn for firewood . They sat this morning in the kitchen full of sun , and , speaking not to him but to the sleigh , to icicles , to the dark , motionless pine woods , she said , " I wonder if on a day like this they used to take the pastor home after lunch . " Daniel gazed abstractedly at the bright-silver drifts beside the well and said nothing . Presently ap51wagon went past hauled by two oxen with bells on their yoke . This was the hour they always passed , taking to an unknown destination an aged man in a fur hat and an aged woman in a shawl . May and Daniel listened . Suddenly , with impromptu anger , Daniel said , " What did you just say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , after a pause , " It would be lovely at Jamaica Pond today . " He wheeled on her and pounded the table with his fist . " I did not ask for this ! " The color rose feverishly to his thin cheeks and his breath was agitated . " You are trying to make me sick again . It was wonderful , was n't it , for you while I was gone ? " " Oh , no , no ! Oh , no , Daniel , it was hell ! " " Then , by the same token , this must be heaven . " He smiled , the professor catching out a student in a fallacy . " Heaven . " She said the word bitterly . " Then why do you stay here ? " he cried . It was a cheap impasse , desolate , true , unfair . She did not answer him . After a while he said , " I almost believe there 's something you have n't told me . " She began to cry at once , blubbering across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . What am I to say ? What have I done ? " He looked at her , impervious to her tears , without mercy and yet without contempt . " I do n't know . But you 've done something . " It was as if she were looking through someone else'sp52scrambled closets and bureau drawers for an object that had not been named to her , but nowhere could she find her gross offense . Domestically she asked him if he would have more coffee and he peremptorily refused and demanded , " Will you tell me why it is you must badger me ? Is it a compulsion ? Ca n't you control it ? Are you going mad ? " From that day onward , May felt a certain stirring of life within her solitude , and now and again , looking up from a book to see if the damper on the stove was right , to listen to a rat renovating its house-within-a-house , to watch the belled oxen pass , she nursed her wound , hugged it , repeated his awful words exactly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips had looked and his bright , farsighted eyes . She could not read for long at any time , nor could she sew . She cared little now for planning changes in her house ; she had meant to sand the painted floors to uncover the wood of the wide boards and she had imagined how the long , paneled windows of the drawing room would look when yellow velvet curtainshung there in the spring . Now , schooled by silence and indifference , she was immune to disrepair and to the damage done by the wind and snow , and she looked , as Daniel did , without dislike upon the old and nasty wallpaper and upon the shabby kitchen floor . One day , she knew that the sleigh would stay where it was so long as they stayed there . From every thought , she returnedp53to her deep , bleeding injury . He had asked her if she were going mad . She repaid him in the dark afternoons while he was closeted away in his study , hardly making a sound save when he added wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . She sat at the kitchen table looking at the sleigh , and she gave Daniel insult for his injury by imagining a lover . She did not imagine his face , but she imagined his clothing , which would be costly and in the best of taste , and his manner , which would be urbane and anticipatory of her least whim , and his clever speech , and his adept courtship that would begin the moment he looked at the sleigh and said , " I must get rid of that for you at once . " She might be a widow , she might be divorced , she might be committing adultery . Certainly there was no need to specify in an affair so securely legal . There was no need , that is , up to a point , and then the point came when she took in the fact that she not only believed in this lover but loved him and depended wholly on his companionship . She complained to him of Daniel and he consoled her ; she told him stories of her girlhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys her own age ; she dazzled him sometimes with the wise comments she made on the books she read . It came to be true that if she so much as looked at the sleigh , she was weakened , failing with starvation . Often , about her daily tasks of cooking food and washing dishes and tending the fires and shopping inp54the general store of the village , she thought she should watch her step , that it was this sort of thing that did make one go mad ; for a while , then , she went back to Daniel 's question , sharpening its razor edge . But she could not corral her alien thoughts and she trembled as she bought split peas , fearful that the old men loafing by the stove could see the incubus of her sins beside her . She could not avert such thoughts when they rushed upon her sometimes at tea with one of the old religious ladies of the neighborhood , so that , in the middle of a conversation about a deaconess in Bath , she retired from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his arms outstretched , even as she sat up straight in a Bostonrocker , even as she accepted another cup of tea . She lingered over the cake plates and the simple talk , postponingher return to her own house and to Daniel , whom she continually betrayed . It was not long after she recognized her love that she began to wake up even before the dawn and to be all day quick to everything , observant of all the signs of age and eccentricity in her husband , and she compared him in every particular  --  to his humiliation , in her eyes  --  with the man whom now it seemed to her she had alwaysloved at fever pitch . Once when Daniel , in a rare mood , kissed her , she drew back involuntarily and he said gently , " I wish I knew what you had done , poor dear . " He looked , as if for written words , in her face . " You said you knew , " she said , terrified.  | " I do . " " Then why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was high and frantic . " You do n't talk sense ! " " I do , " he said sedately . " I talk sense always . It is you who are oblique . " Her eyes stole like a sneak to the sleigh . " But I wish I knew your motive , " he said impartially . For a minute , she felt that they were two maniacs answering each other questions that had not been asked , never touching the matter at hand because they did not know what the matter was . But in the next moment , when he turned back to her spontaneously and clasped her head between his hands and said , like a tolerant father , " I forgive you , darling , because you do n't know how you persecute me . No one knows except the sufferer what this sickness is , " she knew again , helplessly , that they were not harmonious even in their aberrations . These days of winter came and went , and on each of them , after breakfast and as the oxen passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could no longer truthfullydeny that she was guilty , for she was in love , and she heard the subterfuge in her own voice and felt the guilty fever in her veins . Daniel knew it , too , and watched her . When she was alone , she felt her lover 's presence protecting her  --  when she walked past the stiff spiraea , with icy cobwebs hung between its twigs , down to the lake , where the black , unmeasured water was hiddenbeneath a lid of ice ; when she walked , instead , to the salt river to see the tar-paper shacks where the menp56caught smelt through the ice ; when she walked in the dead dusk up the hill from the store , catching her breath the moment she saw the sleigh . But sometimes this splendidbeing mocked her when , freezing with fear of the consequences of her sin , she ran up the stairs to Daniel 's room and burrowed her head in his shoulder and cried , " Come downstairs ! I 'm lonely , please come down ! " But he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his calmly inquisitive regard , she went back alone and stood at the kitchen window , coyly half hidden behind the curtains . For months she lived with her daily dishonor , rattled , ashamed , stubbornly clinging to her secret . But she grew more and more afraid when , oftener and oftener , Daniel said , " Why do you lie to me ? What does this mood of yours mean ? " and she could no longer sleep . In the raw nights , she lay straight beside him as he slept , and she stared at the ceiling , as bright as the snow it reflected , and tried not to think of the sleigh out there under the elm tree but could think only of it and of the man , her lover , who was connected with it somehow . She said to herself , as she listened to his breathing , " If I confessed to Daniel , he would understand that I was lonely and he would comfort me , saying , I am here , May . I shall never let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was so separated from the world , so far removed from his touch and his voice , so solitary , that she would have sued a stranger for companionship . Daniel slept deeply , having no guilt to make him toss . He slept ,  |p57indeed  , so well that he never even heard the ditcher on snowy nights rising with a groan over the hill , flinging the snow from the road and warning of its approach by lights that first flashed red , then blue . As it passed their house , the hurled snow swashed like flames . All night she heard the squirrels adding up their nuts in the walls and heard the spirit of the house creaking and softly clicking upon the stairs and in the attics . In early spring , when the whippoorwills begged in the cattails and the marsh reeds , and the northern lights patinated the lake and the tidal river , and the stars were large , and the huge vine of Dutchman's-pipe had started to leaf out , May went to bed late . Each night she sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog as it hightailed it for home , the single cry of a loon . Night after night , she waited for the advent of her rebirthwhile upstairs Daniel , who had spoken tolerantly of her vigils , slept , keeping his knowledge of her to himself . " A symptom , " he had said , scowling in concentration , as he remarked upon her new habit . " Let it run its course . Perhaps when this is over , you will know the reason why you torture me with these obsessions and will stop . You know , you may really have a slight disorderof the mind . It would be nothing to be ashamed of ; you could go to a sanitarium . " One night , looking out the window , she clearly saw her lover sitting in the sleigh . His hand was over his eyes and his chin was covered by a red silk scarf . Hep58wore no hat and his hair was fair . He was tall and his long legs stretched indolently along the floorboard . He was younger than she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for there was a delicate pallor on his high , intelligent forehead and there was an invalid 's languor in his whole attitude . He wore a white blazer and gray flannels and there was a yellow rosebud in his lapel . Young as he was , he did not , even so , seem to belong to her generation ; rather , he seemed to be the reincarnationof someone 's uncle as he had been fifty years before . May did not move until he vanished , and then , even though she knew now that she was truly bedeviled , the only emotion she had was bashfulness , mingledwith doubt ; she was not sure , that is , that he loved her . That night , she slept a while . She lay near to Daniel , who was smiling in the moonlight . She could tell that the sleep she would have tonight would be as heavy as a coma , and she was aware of the moment she was overtaken . She was in a canoe in a meadow of water lilies and her lover was tranquilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " to eat an egg with you . " She was nervous lest the canoe tip over , but at the same time she was charmed by his wit and by the way he lightly touched her shoulder with the varnished paddle . " May ? May ? I love you , May . "  | " Oh ! " enchanted , she heard her voice replying . " Oh , I love you , too ! " " The winter is over , May . You must forgive the hallucinationsof a sick man . " She woke to see Daniel 's fair , pale head bending toward her . " He is old ! He is ill ! " she thought , but through her tears , to deceive him one last time , she cried , " Oh , thank God , Daniel ! " He was feeling cold and wakeful and he asked her to make him a cup of tea ; before she left the room , he kissed her hands and arms and said , " If I am ever sick again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the kitchen , cold with shadows and with the obtrusion of dawn , she was belabored by a chill . " What time is it ? " she said aloud , although she did not care . She remembered , not for any reason , a day when she and Daniel had stood in the yard last October wondering whether they should cover the chimneys that would not be used and he decided that they should not , but he had said , " I hope no birds get trapped . " She had replied , " I thought they all left at about this time for the South , " and he had answered , with an unintelligible reproach in his voice , " The starlings stay . " And she remembered , again for no reason , a day when , in pride and excitement , she had burst into the house crying , " I saw an ermine . It was terribly poised and let me watch it quite a while . " He had said categorically , " There are no ermines here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighedp60now and turned to the window . The sleigh was livid in this light and no one was in it ; nor had anyone been in it for many years . But at that moment the blacksmith 's cat came guardedly across the dewy field and climbed into it , as if by careful plan , and curled up on the seat . May prodded the clinkers in the stove and started to the barn for kindling . But she thought of the cold and the damp and the smell of the horses , and she did not go but stood there , holding the poker and leaning upon it as if it were an umbrella . There was no place warm to go . " What time is it ? " she whimpered , heartbroken , and moved the poker , stroking the lion foot of the fireless stove . She knew now that no change would come , and that she would never see her lover again . Confounded utterly , like an orphan in solitary confinement , she went outdoors and got into the sleigh . The blacksmith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat beside him with her hands locked tightly in her lap , rapidly wondering over and over again how she would live the rest of her life.  |p63He  wore hot blue serge knickerbockers and a striped green shirt , but he had no shoes and he had no hat and the only things in his pants pockets were a handkerchiefthat was dirty now , and a white pencil from the Matchless Lumber Company , and a card with Mr. Wilkins ' name printed on it and his own , Jim Littlefield , written on below the printing , and a little aspirin box . In the aspirin box were two of his teeth and the scab from his vaccination . He had come on the train barefoot all the way from Missouri to Oklahoma , because his grandmother had died and Mr. Wilkins , the preacher , had said it would be nice out here with other Indian boys and girls . Mr. Wilkins had put him on the through train and given the nigger man in the coach half a dollar to keep an eye on him , explaining that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he stood on the crinkled cinders beside the tracks and saw the train moving away like a fast little fly , and although Mr. Wilkins had promisedon his word of honor , there was no one to meet him . There was no one anywhere . He looked in the windows of the yellow depot , where there was nothing but a fat stove and a bench and a tarnished spittoon and ap64small office , where a telegraph machine nervously ticked to itself . A freshly painted handcar stood on a side track near the water tower , looking as if no one were ever going to get into it again . There was n't a sound , there was n't even a dog or a bee , and there was nothing to look at except the bare blue sky and , across the tracks , a field of stubble that stretched as far as year after next beyond a rusty barbed-wire fence . Right by the door of the depot , there was an oblong piece of tin , which , shining in the sun , looked cool although , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite your foot . It looked cool because it made him think of how the rain water used to shine in the washtubs in Grandma 's back yard . On washday , when he had drawn buckets of it for her , it would sometimes splash over on his feet with a wonderful sound and a wonderful feeling . After the washing was on the line , she would black the stove and scrub the kitchen floor , and then she would take her ease , drinking a drink of blood-red sassafras as she sat rocking on the porch , shaded with wisteria . At times like that , on a hot summer day , she used to smell as cool as the underside of a leaf . There was nothing cool here , so far as you could see . The paint on the depot was so bright you could read the newspaper by it in the dark . Jim could not see any trees save one , way yonder in the stubble field , and it looked poor and lean . In Missouri , there were big trees , as shady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the cement steps of the mortuary parlor in the shade ofp65the acacias , crying for his grandmother , whom he had seen in her cat-gray coffin . Mr. Wilkins had lipped some snuff and consoled him , talking through his nose , which looked like an unripe strawberry . " I do n't want to be no orphan , " Jim had cried , thinking of the asylum out by the fairground , where the kids wore gray cotton uniformsand came to town once a week on the trolley car to go to the library . Many of them wore glasses and some of them were lame . Mr. Wilkins had said , " Landagoshen , Jim boy , did n't I say you were going to be Uncle Sam 's boy ? Uncle Sam do n't fool with orphans , he only takes care of citizens . " On the train , a fat man had asked him what he was going to be when he grew up and Jim had said , " An aborigine . " The man had laughed until he 'd had to wipe his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl who was with him had said crossly , " What 's funny , Daddy ? What did the child say ? " It had been cool before that , when he and Mr. Wilkins were waiting under the tall maple trees that grew beside the depot in Missouri and Mr. Marvin Dannenbaum 's old white horse was drinking water out of the moss-lined trough . And just behind them , on LindenStreet , Miss Bessie Ryder had been out in her yard picking a little mess of red raspberries for her breakfast . The dew would have still been on them when she doused them good with cream . Over the front of her little house there was a lattice where English ivy grew and her well was surrounded by periwinkle . But Jim could not remember any of that coolnessp66when he went out of the shade of the maples into the coach . Mrs. Wilkins had put up a lunch for him ; when he ate it later , he found a dead ant on one of the peanutbuttersandwiches and the Baby Ruth had run all over the knobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a headache and the green seat was as scratchy as a brush when he lay down and put his cheek on it . The train had smelled like the Fourth of July , like punk and lady crackers , and when it stopped in little towns , its rest was uneasy , for it throbbed and jerked and hissed like an old dog too feeble to get out of the sun . Once , the nigger man had taken him into the baggage car to look at some kind of big , expensive collie in a cage , muzzled and glaring fiercely through the screen ; there were trunks and boxes of every shape , including one large , round one that the nigger man said held nothing but one enormous cheese from Michigan . When Jim got back to his seat , the fat man with the little girl had bought a box lunch that was put on the train at Sedalia , and Jim had watched them eat fried chicken and mustardgreens and beet pickles and pone . The next time the train stopped , the nigger man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into the station . Jim had made the train wheels say " Uncle Sam , Uncle Sam , " and then he had n't been able to make them stop , even when he was half asleep . Mr. Wilkins had said that Uncle Sam was n't one of your fair-weather friends that would let a Cherokee down when all hisp67kin were dead . It was a blessing to be an Indian , the preacher had said , and Mrs. Wilkins had said , " It surely is , Jim boy . I 'd give anything to be an Indian , just anything you can name . " She had been stringing wax beans when she 'd said that , and the ham hock she would cook with them had already been simmering on the back of the stove . Jim had wanted to ask her why she would like to be an Indian , but she 'd seemed to have her mind on the beans , so he 'd said nothing and stroked the turkey wing she used for brushing the stove . It was hot enough to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know what he would do if someone did not come . He could not walk barefoot all the way back to Missouri ; he would get lost if he did not follow the tracks , and if he did follow them and a train came when he was drowsy , he might get scooped up by the cowcatcher and be hurled to kingdom come . He sat on his heels and waited , feeling the gray clinkers pressing into his feet , listening to the noontime sleep . Heat waves trembled between him and the depot and for a long time there was no sound save for the anxious telegraphmachine , which was saying something important , although no one would heed . Perhaps it was about him  --  Jim ! It could be a telegram from Mr. Wilkins saying for them to send him back . The preacher might have found a relation that Jim could live with . The boy saw , suddenly , the tall , white colonnade of a rich man 's house by the Missouri River ; he had gone there often to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the yellow-haired lady at the back door of the big house had always said , " Do n't you want to rest a spell , Jimmy , here where it 's cool ? " He would sit on a bench at the long table and pet the mother cat who slept on the window sill and the lady would say , " You like my old puss-in-boots , do n't you ? Maybe you 'd best come and live with me and her , seeing that she 's alreadygot your tongue . " Sometimes this lady wore a lace boudoir cap with a blue silk bow on the front , and once she had given him a button with a pin that said , " LET 'S CRACK THE VOLSTEAD ACT . " The stubborn stutterof the machine could be a message from her , or maybe it was from Miss Bessie Ryder , who once had told his fortune with cards in a little room with pictures of Napoleoneverywhere ; the English ivy growing just outsidemade patterns on Napoleon 's face , and in the little silver pitcher in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue anemone . Or it could be the Wilkinses themselves sending for him to come and live in the attic room , where there was the old cradle their baby had died in and a pink quilt on the bed with six-pointed stars . Jim cried , catching his tears with his gentle tongue . Then , a long way off , a bell began to ring slowly and sweetly , and when it stopped , he heard an automobile coming with its bumptious cutout open . He went on crying , but in a different way , and his stomach thumped with excitement , for he knew it would be the people from the school , and suddenly he could not bear to have them find him . He ran the length of the depot and  --   |p69then  ran back again , and then he hopped on one foot to the door and hopped on the piece of tin . He screamed with the awful , surprising pain . He sat down and seized his burned foot with both his hands , and through his sobs he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " He heard the car stop and the doors slam and he heard a lady say , " Wait a minute . Oh , it 's all right . " Jim shut his eyes as feet munched the cinders , closer and closer to him . " Do n't touch me ! " he shrieked , not opening his eyes , and there was a silence like the silence after the district nurse in Missouri had looked down his throat . They did not touch him , so he stopped crying , and the lady said , " Why , the train must have come long ago ! I will positivelygive that stationmaster a piece of my mind . " Jim opened his eyes . There was a big man , with very black hair , which fell into his face , wearing a spotted tan suit and a ring with a turquoise the size of a quarter . The woman had gold earrings and gold teeth , which she showed in a mechanical smile , and she wore a blue silk dress with white embroidery on the bertha . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the arm where he had been vaccinated ; baffled by everything in the world , he cried wildly . The woman bent down and said , " Well , well , well , there , there , there . " Jim was half suffocated by the smell of medicine and of her buttery black hair . The man and woman looked at each other , and Jim 's skin prickled because he knew they were wondering why he had not brought anything.  |p70Mr  . Wilkins had said you did n't need to , not even shoes . " Well , honey , " said the lady , taking his hand , " we 've come a long way all by our lonesome , have n't we ? " " A mighty long way , " said the man , laughing heartily to make a joke of it . He took Jim 's other hand and made him stand up , and then they started down the cinder path and around the corner of the depot to a tall , black touring car , which said on the door : DEPARTMENT OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty demijohns and a brand-new hoe . " Hop in front , sonny , " said the man . The black leather seat scorched Jim 's legs , and he put his hand over his eyes to shut out the dazzle of the windshield . " No shoes , " said the woman , getting in beside him . " Already noted , " said the man . He got in , too , and his fat thigh was dampish at Jim 's elbow . Jim worried about the telegraph machine . Would it go on until someone came to listen to it or would it stop after a while like a telephone ? It must be about him , because he was the only one who had got off the train here , and it must be from someone saying to send him back , because there was nothing else it could be about . His heart went as fast as a bobbin being filled and he wanted to throw up and to hide and to cram a million grapes into his mouth and to chase a scared girl with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming bloody murder so that they would let him get out of the car , but they might just whip him for that , whip him with an inner tube or beat him over the head with the new hoe . But he would n't stay at the school ! If there was no other way , he would ride home on a freight car , like a hobo , and sleep in the belfry of the church under the crazy bell . He would escape tonight , he told himself , and he pressed his hand on his heart to make it quiet down . From the other side of the depot , you could see the town . A wide street went straight through the level middleof it , and it had the same kind of stores and houses and lampposts that any other town had . The trees looked like leftovers , and the peaked brown dogs slinked behind the trash cans in an ornery way . The man started the car , and as they drove up the main street , Jim could tell that the men sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigtails and closed-up faces . They sat in a crouch , with their big heads hanging forward and their flat-fingered hands motionless between their knees . The women who were not fat were as lean and spry as katydids , and all of them walked up and down the main street with baskets full of roasting ears on one arm and babies on the other . The wooden cupola on the red brick courthouse was painted yellow-green and in the yard men lay with their hats over their eyes or sat limply on the iron benches under the runty trees , whose leaves were gray with dust or lice . A few children with ice/cream cones skulked in the doorways , like abused cats . Everyone looked ailing . The man from the school gestured with the hand that wore the heavy turquoise , and he said , " Son , this is your ancestors ' town . This here is the capital of the Cherokee nation . " " You are n't forgetting the water , are you , Billings ? " said the woman in a distracted way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Jim , " Do you know what Cherokee ' means ? " " No , " said Jim . The woman looked over his head at the man . " Goodnessknows , we earn our bread . What can you do with Indians if they do n't know they 're Indians ? " " I always knew I was an Indian , " said the man . " And so did I , " said the woman . " Always . " Jim sat , in this terrible heat and terrible lack of privacy , between their mature bodies and dared not even change the position of his legs , lest he hit the gearshift . He felt that they were both looking at him as if a rash were coming out on his face and he wished they would hurry and get to the school , so that he could start escaping . At the thought of running away after the sun was down and animals and robbers started creeping in the dark , his heart started up again , like an engine with no one in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man got out and heaved the demijohns onto the sidewalk . In the window of the store was a vast pink foot with two cornp73plasters and a bunion plaster . Next door was an empty building and on its window lights were pasted signs far J. M. Barclay 's Carnival Show and for Copenhagen snuff and for Clabber Girl baking powder . The carnival sign was torn and faded , the way such signs always are , and the leg of a red-haired bareback rider was tattered shabbily . How hot a carnival would be , with the smell of dung and popcorn ! Even a Ferris wheel on a day like this would be no fun . Awful as it was here , where the sun made a sound on the roof of the car , it would be even worse to be stuck in the highest seat of a Ferris wheel when something went wrong below . A boy would die of the heat and the fear and the sickness as he looked down at the distant ground , littered with disintegrated popcorn balls . The lady beside Jim took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she wiped the sweat away from her upper lip , he caught a delicate fragrance that made him think of the yellow-haired lady in Missouri and he said , " I want to write a letter as soon as I get there . " " Well , we 'll see , " the woman said . " Who do you want to write to ? " But the man came back , so Jim did not have to answer . The man staggered , with his stomach pushed out , under the weight of the demijohn , and as he put it in the back seat , he said savagely , " I wish one of those fellers in Washington would have to do this a couple , three times . Then maybe the Department would : get down to brass tacks about that septic tank . " " The Department ! " ejaculated the woman bitterly  |p74The  man brought the other jug of water , and they drove off again , coming presently to a highway that stretched out long and white , and as shining as the piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm wagon with a rocking chair in the back , in which a woman smaller and more withered than Jim 's grandmother sat , smoking a corncob pipe . Three dark little children were sitting at her feet , lined up along one edge of the wagon with their chins on the sideboard , and they stared hard at the IndianService car . The one in the middle waved timidly and then hid his head in his shoulder , like a bird , and giggled . " Creeks ! " cried the woman angrily . " Everywhere we see Creeks these days ! What will become of the Chero-kees ? " " Ask the boy what his blood is , " said the man . " Well , Jim , " said the woman , " did you hear what Mr. Standing-Deer said ? " " What ? " said Jim and turned convulsively to look at the man with that peculiar name . " Do you remember your mother and father ? " said the woman . " No , they were dead . " " How did they die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ague , maybe . " " He says they may have died of the ague , " said the woman to Mr. Standing-Deer , as if he were deaf . " I have n't heard that word ague ' for years . Probably hep75means flu . Do you think perhaps this archaism is an index to the culture pattern from which he comes ? " Mr. Standing-Deer made a doglike sound in his throat . " Ask me another , " he said . " I do n't care about his speech at this stage of the game  --  it 's the blood I 'm talking about . " " Were Mama and Daddy both Indians ? " asked the woman kindly . " I do n't care ! " Jim said . He had meant to say " I do n't know , " but he could not change it afterward , because he commenced to cry again so hard that the woman patted his shoulder and did not ask him any more questions . She told him that her name was Miss Hornet and that she had been born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matron and that Mr. StandingDeerwas the boys ' counselor . She said she was sure Jim would like it at the school . " Uncle Sam takes care of us all just as well as he can , so we should be polite to him and not let him see that we are homesick , " she said , and Jim , thinking of his getaway this night , said softly , " Yes 'm , Mr. Wilkins already told me . " After a time they turned into a drive , at the end of which was a big , white gate . Beyond it lay terraced lawns , where trees grew beside a group of buildings . It was hushed here , too . In spots , the grass was yellow , and the water in the ditch beyond the gate was slow . There was a gravelly space for kids to play in , but there were no kids there . There were a slide and some swingsp76and a teeter-totter , but they looked as deserted as bones , and over the whole place there hung a tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when a twister had come at home , all the windows in Mr. Dannenbaum 's house had been blown out , and it had taken the dinner off some old folks ' table , and when Jim and his grandmother went out to look , there was the gravy bowl sitting on top of a fence post without a drop gone out of it . Jim meant to be meek and mild until the sun went down , so that they would not suspect , and when Mr. Standing-Deer got out to open the gate , he said quietly to Miss Hornet , " Are the children all asleep now ? " " Yes , we are all asleep now , " she said . " Some of us are n't feeling any too well these hot days . " Jim stole an anxious glance at her to see if she were sick with somethingcatching , but he could tell nothing from her smooth brown face . The buildings were big and were made of dark stone , and because the shades were down in most of the windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would spend this little time before nightfall and of all the cool things there would be inside  --  a drink of water and some potted ferns and cold white busts of Abraham Lincoln and George Washington and rubber treads on the stairs , like those in the public school back in Missouri . Mr. Standing-Deer stopped the car by one of the smaller buildings , whose walls were covered with trumpet creeper . There had been trumpet creeper at Grandma 's , too , growing over the backhouse , and a sillyp77little girl named Lady had thought the blossoms were really trumpets and said the fairies could hear her playing " The Battle Hymn of the Republic " on them . She was the girl who had said she had found a worm in a chocolate bar and a tack in a cracker . With Lady , Jim used to float nasturtium leaves on the rain water in the tubs , and then they would eat them as they sat in the string hammock under the shade of the sycamores . It was true that there were ferns in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them greedily , though they were pale and juiceless-looking and grew out of a sagging wicker-covered box . To the left of the door was an office , and in it , behind a desk , sat a big Indian woman who was lacing the fingers of one hand with a rubber band . She was wearing a man 's white shirt and a necktie with an opal stickpin , and around her fat waist she wore a broad beaded belt . Her hair was braided around her head , and right at the top there was a trumpetflower , looking perfectly natural , as if it grew there . " Is this the new boy ? " she said to Miss Hornet . " Who else would it be , pray tell ? " said Miss Hornet crossly . " My name is Miss Dreadfulwater , " said the woman at the desk in an awful , roaring voice , and then she laughed and grabbed Jim 's hand and shouted , " And you 'd better watch your step or I 'll dreadfulwater you . " Jim shivered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard his distant voice say , " Did you get Mr. Wilkins ' telegram ? "  | " Telegram ? " boomed Miss Dreadfulwater , and laughed uproariously . " Oh , sure , we got his telegram . Telegram and long-distance telephone call . Did n't you come in a de-luxe Pullman drawing room ? And did n't Uncle Sam his own self meet you in the company limousine ? Why , yes , sir , Mr. Wilkins , and Uncle Sam and Honest Harold in Washington , and all of us here have just been thinking about hardly anything else but Jim Littlefield . " Mr. Standing-Deer said wearily , " For Christ 's sake , Sally , turn on the soft music . The kid 's dead beat . " " I 'm dead beat , too , Mr. Lying-Moose and Miss Yellow-Jacket , and I say it 's too much . It 's too much , I say . There are six more down in this dormitory alone , and that leaves , altogether , eight well ones . And the well ones are half dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzards . " There was something wrong with Miss Dreadfulwater that Jim could not quite understand . He would have said she was drunk if she had n't been a woman and a sort of teacher . She took a card out of the desk and asked him how old he was and if he had been vaccinated and what his parents ' names were . He wanted a drink of water , or wanted at least to go and smell the ferns , but he dared not ask and stood before the desk feeling that he was already sick with whatever it was the others were sick with . Mr. Standing-Deer took a gun out of his coat pocket and put it on the desk and then he went downp79the hall , saying over his shoulder , " I guess they 're all too sick to try and fly the coop for a while . " " How old was your mother when she died ? " said Miss Dreadfulwater . " Eighteen and a half , " said Jim . " How do you know ? " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You knew ? You remember your mother ? " " Yes , " said Jim . " She was a Bolshevik . " Miss Dreadfulwater put down her Eversharp and looked straight into his eyes . " Are you crazy with the heat or am I ? " she said . He rather liked her , after all , and so he smiled until Miss Hornet said , " Hurry along , Sally , I have n't got all day . " " O.K. , O.K. , Queenie . I just wanted to straighten out this about the Bolshevik . " " Oh , do it later , " said Miss Hornet . " You know he 's just making up a story . They all do when they first come . " Miss Dreadfulwater asked some more questions  --  whether his tonsils were out , who Mr. Wilkins was , whether Jim thought he was a full-blood or a half-breed or what . She finished finally and put the card back in the drawer , and then Miss Hornet said to Jim , " What would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever you like till suppertime . It 's perfectly clear that you have no unpacking to do . "  | " Did he come just like this ? " said Miss Dreadfulwater , astonished . " Really ? " Miss Hornet ignored her and said , " What would you like to do ? " " I do n't know , " Jim said . " Of course you do , " she said sharply . " Do you want to play on the slide ? Or the swings ? None of the other children are out , but I should think a boy of eight could find plenty of ways to amuse himself . " " I can , " he said . " I 'll go outside . " " He ought to go to bed , " said Miss Dreadfulwater . " You ought to put him to bed right now if you do n't want him to come down with it . " " Be still , Sally , " said Miss Hornet . " You run along now , Jim . " Although Jim was terribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking fountain or even to glance at the ferns . The composition floor was cool to his feet , but when he went out the door the heat came at him like a slapping hand . He did not mind it , because he would soon escape . The word " escape " itself refreshed him and he said it twice under his breath as he walked across the lawn . In back of the building , there was a good-sized tree and a boy was sitting in the shade of it . He wore a green visor , and he was reading a book and chewing gum like sixty . Jim walked up to him and said , " Do you know where any water is ? "  |p81The  boy took off the visor , and Jim saw that his eyes were bright red . They were so startling that he could not help staring . The boy said , " The water 's poisonous . There 's an epidemic here . " Jim connected the poisonous water and the sickness in the dormitory with the boy 's red eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gum on his lower lip and clamped it there with his upper teeth , which were striped with gray and were finely notched , like a bread knife . " One died , " he said , and laughed and rolled over on his stomach . At the edge of the lawn beyond all the buildings , Jim saw a line of trees , the sort that follow a riverbank , and he thought that when it got dark , that was where he would go . But he was afraid , and even though it was hot and still here and he was thirsty , he did not want the day to end soon , and he said to the ugly , laughing boy , " Is n't there any good water at all ? " " There is , " said the boy , sitting up again and putting his visor on , " but not for Indians . I 'm going to run away . " He popped his gum twice and then he pulled it out of his mouth for a full foot and swung it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When ? " " When my plans are laid , " said the boy , showing all his strange teeth in a smile that was not the least friendly . " You know whose hangout is over there past the trees ? " " No , whose ? " " Clyde Barrow 's , " whispered the boy . " Not long ago ,  |p82they  came and smoked him out with tommy guns . That 's where I 'm going when I leave here . " For the first time , Jim noticed the boy 's clothes . He wore blue denim trousers and a blue shirt to match , and instead of a beat , he wore a bright-red sash , about the color of his eyes . It was certainly not anything Jim had ever seen any other boy wear , and he said , pointing to it , " Is that a flag or something ? " " It 's the red sash , " replied the boy . " It 's a penalty . You are n't supposed to be talking to me when I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret smile and took his gum out of his mouth and rolled it between his thumb and forefinger . " What 's your name , anyway ? " he asked . " Jim Littlefield . " " That 's not Indian . My name is Rock Forward Mankiller . My father 's name is **57;6791;TOOLONG . It 's not that long in Navajo . " " Navajo ? " asked Jim . " Yes . I 'm not Cherokee , " said the boy . " What did you do to make them put the red sash on you ? " Jim asked , wishing to know , yet not wanting to hear . " Would n't you like to know ? " said Rock Forward and started to chew his gum again . Jim sat down in the shade beside him and looked at his burned foot . There was no blister , but it was red and the skin felt drawn . His head ached and his throat was sore , and he wanted to lie down on his stomach and go to sleep , but he daredp83not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt again the burden of the waiting silence ; once a fool blue jay started to raise the roof in Clyde Barrow 's woods and a couple of times he heard a cow moo , but the rest of the time there was only this hot stillness in which the red-eyed boy stared at him calmly . " What do they do if you escape and they catch you ? " Jim asked , trembling and giving himself away . " Standing-Deer comes after you with his six gun , and then you get the red sash , " said Rock Forward , eying him closely . " You ca n't get far unless you lay your plans . I know what you 're thinking about , Littlefield . All new kids do . I 'm wise to it . " He giggled and stretched his arms out wide , and once again he showed his sickening teeth . The desire to sleep was so strong that Jim was not even angry with Rock Forward , and he swayed to and fro , half dozing , longing to lie full length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake people made through a half-open door . Little , bright-colored memories came to him pleasantly , like the smallest valentines . The reason he knew that his mother had been a Bolshevik was that she 'd had a pair of crimson satin slippers , which Grandma had kept in a drawer , along with her best crocheted pot holders and an album of picture postal cards from Gettysburg . The lovely shoes were made of satin and the heels were covered with rhinestones . The shiny cloth , roughened in places , was the color of Rockp84Forward 's eyes and of his sash . Jim said , " No kidding , why do you have to wear the red sash ? " " I stole Standing-Deer 's gun , if you want to know , and I said , To hell with Uncle Sam . ' " Jim heard what the boy said but he paid no mind , and he said , not to the boy or to anyone , " I 'll wait till tomorrow . I 'm too sleepy now . " Nor did Rock Forward pay any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head away and talking in the direction of the outlaw 's hangout , " If I get sick with the epidemicand die , I 'll kill them all . Standing-Deer first and Dreadfulwater second and Hornet third . I 'll burn the whole place up and I 'll spit everywhere . " " Do you have a father ? " said Jim , scarcely able to get the words out . " Of course I have a father , " said Rock Forward in a sudden rage . " Did n't I just tell you his name ? Did n't you know he was in jail for killing a well-known attorneyin Del Rio , Texas ? If he knew I was here , he 'd kill them all . He 'd take this red sash and tear it to smithereens . I 'm no orphan and I 'm not a Cherokee like the rest of you either , and when I get out of here , StandingDeerhad just better watch out . He 'd just better watch his p 's and q 's when I get a six gun of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bent it double , crackingit smack down the middle of the isinglass , and then , without another word , he went running off in the direction of the line of trees , the ends of the red sash flapping at his side.  |p85Jim  was too sleepy to care about anything now  --  now that he had decided to wait until tomorrow . He did not even care that it was hot . He lay down on the sickly grass , and for a while he watched a lonesome leaf-cutter bee easing a little piece of plantain into its hole . He hoped they would not wake him up and make him walk into the dormitory ; he hoped that Mr. Standing-Deer would come and carry him , and he could see himself with his head resting on that massive shoulder in the spotted coat . He saw himself growing smaller and smaller and lying in a bureau drawer , like Kayo in the funny papers . He rustled in his sleep , moving away from the sharp heels of the red shoes , and something as soft and deep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I bought the pair of them in Berlin for forty marks , " Mrs. Andreas was saying to Dr. Reinmuth , who had admiredthe twin decanters on her dinner table . " It sickens me , the way they must let their treasures go for nothing . I can take no pride in having got a bargain when I feel like a pirate . " Evan Leckie , an American journalist who was the extra man at the party , turned away from the woman on his right to glance at his hostess to see if her face revealed the hypocrisy he had heard , ever so faintly , in her voice , but he could read nothing in her bland eyes , nor could he discover the reaction of her interlocutor , who slightly inclined his head in acknowledgment of her sympathy for his mortified compatriots but said nothing and resumed his affectionate scrutiny of the decanters as Mrs. Andreas went on to enumerate other instances of the victors ' gains through the Germans ' losses . Evan , just transferred to Heidelberg from the squalor and perdition of Nuremberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more handsometimes . One of the bottles was filled with red wine , which gleamed darkly through the lustrous , sculptured glass , chased with silver , and the other with pale , sunnyp88Chablis . The candlelight invested the wines with a propertybeyond taste and fluidity , a subtile grace belonging to a world almost imaginary in its elegance , and for a moment Evan warmed toward Mrs. Andreas , who had tried to resuscitate this charming world for her guests by putting the decanters in the becoming company of heavy , florid silverware and Dresden fruit plates and a bowl of immaculate white roses , and by dressing herself , a plump and unexceptional person , in an opulent frock of gold brocade and a little queenly crown of amethysts for her curly , graying hair . The double doors to the garden were open to admit the moonlight and the summer breeze , and now and again , in the course of the meal , Evan had glanced out and had seen luminous nicotiana and delphiniums growingprofusely beside a high stone wall . Here , in the hilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country ; there was not a sound of jeeps or drunken G.I.s to disturbthe light and general conversation of Americans breaking bread with Germans . Only by implication and indirection were the war and the Occupation spoken of , and in this abandonment of the contemporary , the vanquished , these charming Reinmuths , save by their dress and their speech , could not be distinguished from the conquerors . If chivalry , thought Evan , were ever to return to the world , peace would come with it , but evenings like this were isolated , were all but lost in the vast , arid wastes of the present hour within the present decade . And the pity that Mrs. Andreas bestowed upon her Ger/man guests would not return to them the decanters they had forfeited , nor would her hospitality obliterate from their hearts the knowledge of their immense dilemma . Paradoxically , it was only upon the highest possible level that Germans and Americans these days could communicate ; only a past that was now irretrievable could bring them into harmony with one another . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Virginia , had left him  --  left him , as she had put it in a shout , " to stew in his own juice "  --  Evan had spent his evenings in the bar of his hotel , drinking by himself and listening , in a trance of boredom , to the conversationsof the Americans about him . The mirrored walls and mirrored ceilings had cast back the manifold reflections of able-bodied Wacs in summer uniforms , who talked of their baseball teams ( once he had seen a phalanx of them in the lobby , armed with bats and catchers ' mitts , looking no less manly than the BrooklynDodgers ) and of posts where they had been stationed and of itineraries , past and future . " Where were you in ' 45 ? " he had heard one of them cry . " New Caledonia ! My God ! So was I. Is n't it a riot to think we were both in New Caledonia in ' 45 and now are here in the Theater ? " Things had come to a pretty pass , thought Evan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dreams . They did not talk like women and they did not look like women but like a modern mutation , a revision , perhaps more efficient and sturdier , of an old model . Half hypnotizedby the signs of the times , he had come almost top90believe that the days of men and women were over and that the world had moved into a new era dominated by a neuter body called Personnel , whose only concerns were to make history and to snub the history that had already been made . Miss Sally Dean , who sat across from him tonight , had pleased him at first glance with her bright-blond hair and her alabaster shoulders and the fine length of her legs , but over the cocktails his delightdeparted when , in the accents of West Los Angeles , she had said she wished General MacArthur were in Germany , since he was , in her opinion , a " real glamour puss . " The woman on his right , Mrs. Crowell , the wife of a judge from Ohio in the judiciary of the Occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been delivering to him a self-sustaining monologue on the effronteries of German servants , announcing once , with all the authority of an anthropologist , that " the Baden mind is consecrated to dishonesty . " He could not put his finger on it , but , in spite of her familiar housewife 's complaints , she did not sound at all like his mother and his aunts in Charlottesville , whose lives , spun out in loving domesticity , would lose their pungencyif cooks kept civil tongues in their heads and if upstairs maids were not light-fingered . Mrs. Crowell brought to her housekeeping problems a modern and impersonal intellect . " The Baden mind , " " the Franconianmind , " " the German character " were phrases that came forth irrefutably . And the bluestocking wife of a Captain McNaughton , who sat on Evan 's left andp91who taught library science to the wives of other Army officers , had all evening lectured Dr. Reinmuth on the faults ( remediable , in her opinion ) of his generation that had forced the world into war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrior ; she argued hotly , although the German did not oppose her , and sometimes she threatened him with her spoon . It was the German woman , Frau Reinmuth , who , althoughher gray dress was modest and although she wore no jewels and little rouge , captivated Evan with her ineffable femininity ; she , of all the women there , had been challenged by violence and she had ignored it , had firmly and with great poise set it aside . To look at her , no one would know that the slightest alteration had taken place in the dignified modus vivendi she must have known all her life . The serenity she emanated touched him so warmly and so deeply that he almost loved her , and upon the recognition of his feeling he was seized with loneliness and with a sort of homesicknessthat he felt sure she would understand  --  a longing , it was , for the places that she would remember . Suddenlyit occurred to him that the only other time he had been in Heidelberg , he had been here with his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon by trolleyto Schwetzingen to see the palace gardens . Virginia had always hated history and that day she had looked at a cool Palladian summerhouse , designed for witty persiflage and premeditated kisses , and had said , " It 's so chichi it makes me sick . " And she had meant it . Howp92she had prided herself on despising everything that had been made before 1920 , the year of her birth ! Staring at the wines aglow in their fine vessels , Evan recaptured exactly the feeling he had had that day in Schwetzingen when , very abruptly , he had realized that he was only technically bound for life to this fretful iconoclast ; for a short while , there beside the playing fountains , he had made her vanish and in her place there stood a quiet woman , rich in meditations and in fancies . If he had known Frau Reinmuth then , she might have been the one he thought of . Evan watched Dr. Reinmuth as he poured the gold and garnet liquids , first one and then the other , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended the surge of color behind the radiant crystal and he murmured , in a soft Bavarian voice , " Lovely , lovely . Look , Liselotte , how beautiful Mrs. Andreas ' Kara ff en are ! " Frau Reinmuth , wide-faced , twice his size , turned from her talk of the Salzburg Festival with Mr. Andreas and cherished both her husband and the decanters with her broad gray eyes , in whose depths love lay limitlessly . When she praised the design of the cut glass , and the etching of the silver , and the shape of the stoppers , like enormous diamonds , she managed somehow , through the timbre of her voice or its cadences or through the way she looked at him , to proclaim that she loved her husband and that the beauty of the bottles was rivaled and surpassed by the nature of this little man of hers , who , still fascinated , moved his handsome headp93this way and that , the better to see the prismatic green and violet beams that burst from the shelves and cranniesof the glass . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , and his slenderfingers touched and traced the glass as if he were playing a musical instrument that only his ears could hear . He must have been in his middle forties , but he looked like a nervous , gifted boy not twenty yet , he was so slight , his hair was so black and curly , his brown face was so lineless , and there was such candor and curiosity in his dark eyes . He seemed now to want to carry his visual and tactile encounter with the decanters to a furtherpoint , to a completion , to bliss . And Evan , arrested by the man 's absorption ( if it was not that of a child , it was that of an artist bent on abstracting meanings from all the data presented to his senses ) , found it hard to imagine him arguing in a court of law , where the materials , no matter how one elevated and embellished justice , were not poetry . Equally difficult was it to see him as he had been during the war , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like every German one met in a polite American house , Dr. Reinmuth had been an enemy of the Third Reich ; he had escaped concentrationcamp only because his languages were useful to the Nazis . While Evan , for the most part , was suspiciousof these self-named martyrs who seemed always to have fetched up in gentlemanly jobs where their lives were not in the least imperiled , he did believe in Dr. Reinmuth , and was certain that a belligerent ideologyp94could not enlist the tender creature so unaffectedly playing with Mrs. Andreas ' toys , so obviously well beloved by his benevolent wife . Everyone , even Mrs. Crowell , paused a second to look from the man to the woman and to esteem their concord . Frau Reinmuth then returned to Mr. Andreas , but it was plain to see that her mind was only half with him . She said , " I envy you to hear Flagstad . Our pain is that there is no music now , " and in a lower voice she added , " I have seen August bite his lip for sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's nothing now , you know , but a ruin , like everything . " Glancing at her , Evan wondered whether she were older than her husband or if this marriage had been entered upon late , and he concluded that perhaps the second was true , for they were childless  --  the downright Mrs. McNaughtonhad determined that before the canapes were passed  --  and Frau Reinmuth looked born to motherhood . But even more telling was the honeymoon inflectionin her voice , as if she were still marveling now to say the name " August " as easily as she said " I " and to be able to bestow these limnings of her dearest possessiongenerously on the members of a dinner party . It was not that she spoke of him as if he were a child , as some women do who marry late or marry men younger than themselves , but as if he were a paragon with whom she had the remarkable honor to be associated . She , in her boundless patience , could endure being deprived of music and it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear to see August 's grief over the hush that lay upon their singing country ; she lived not only for , she lived in , him . She wore her yellow hair in Germanic braids that coiled around her head , sitting too low to be smart ; her hands were soft and large , honestlymeriting the wide wedding band on the right one . She was as completely a woman as Virginia , in spite of a kind of ravening femaleness and piquant good looks , had never been one . He shuddered to think how she must be maligning him in Nevada to the other angry petitioners , and then he tried to imagine how Frau Reinmuthwould behave under similar circumstances . But it was unthinkable that she should ever be a divorcee ; no matter what sort of man she married , this wifely woman would somehow , he was sure , quell all disorder . Again he felt a wave of affection for her ; he fancied drinking tea with her in a little crowded drawing room at the end of one of these warm days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up through the hills behind the Philosophenweg , proving to the world by their compassionateamity that there was no longer a state of war between their country and his . But he was prevented from spinning out his fantasy of a friendship with the Reinmuths because Mrs. Crowellwas demanding his attention . Her present servant , she told him , was an aristocrat ( " as aristocratic as a German can be , " she said sotto voce , " which is n't sayingmuch " ) and might therefore be expected not to steal the spoons ; now , having brought him up to date on herp96belowstairs problems , she changed the subject and drew him into the orbit of her bright-eyed , pervasive bustling . She understood that he had just come from Nuremberg , where she and the Judge had lived for two years . " Is n't it too profoundly triste ? " she cried . " Where did they billet you , poor thing ? " " At the Grand Hotel , " said Evan , recollecting the Wacs with their mustaches and their soldierly patois . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 's simply overrun with awful Army children ! Not children  --  brats . Brats , I 'm sorry to say , is the only word for them . They actually roller-skate through the lobby , you know , to say nothing of the ghastly noise they make . I used to go to the hairdresser there and finally had to give up because of the hullabaloo . " At the mention of Nuremberg , Dr. Reinmuth had pivoted around toward them and now , speaking across Mrs. McNaughton , he said dreamily , " Once it was a lovely town . We lived there , my wife and I , all our lives until the war . I understand there is now a French orchestrain the opera house that plays calypso for your soldiers . " There sounded in his voice the same note of wonder that he had used when he acclaimed the decantersthat he could not own ; neither could he again possess the beauties of his birthplace . And Evan Leckie , to whom the genesis of war had always been incomprehensible , looked with astonishment at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake had come about , what Eumenides had driven this pairp97to hardship , humiliation , and exile . Whatever else they were , however alien their values might be , these enemieswere , sub specie aeternitatis , of incalculable worth if for no other reason than that , in an unloving world , they loved . Mrs. Andreas , tactfully refusing Dr. Reinmuth 's gambit , since she knew that the deterioration of the NurembergOpera House into a night club must be a painful subject to him , maneuvered her guests until the talk at the table became general . They all continued the exchangethat had begun with Frau Reinmuth and Mr. Andreas on the Salzburg Festival ; they went on to speak of Edinburgh , of the Salome that someone had heard at La Scala , of a coloratura who had delighted the Reinmuthsin Weimar . Dr. Reinmuth then told the story of his having once defended a pianist who had been sued for slander by a violinist ; the defendant had been accusedof saying publicly that the plaintiff played Mozart as if the music had been written for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkey to take up a collection . This anecdote , coinciding with the arrival of the dessert , diverted the stream of talk , and Judge Crowell , whose interest in music was perfunctory and social , revived and took the floor . He told of a murdercase he had tried the week before in Frankfurt and of a rape case on the docket in Stuttgart . Dr. Reinmuth countered with cases he was pleading ; they matched their legal wits , made Latin puns , and so enjoyed theirp98game that the others laughed , although they barely understood the meanings of the words . Dr. Reinmuth , who was again fondling the decanters , said , " I suppose every lawyer is fond of telling the story of his first case . May I tell mine ? " He besought his hostess with an endearing smile , and his wife , forever at his side , pleaded for him , " Oh , do ! " and she explained , " It 's such an extraordinary story of a young lawyer 's first case . " He poured himself a little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Nuremberg , just down from Bonn , with no practice at all , he had one day been called upon by the state to defend a man who had confessed to murdering an old woman and robbing her of sixty pfennig . The defense , of course , was purely a convention , and the man was immediately sentenced to death , since there was no question of his guilt or of the enormity of his crime . Some few days after the trial , Dr. Reinmuth had received an elaborate engraved invitation to the execution by guillotine , which was to be carried out in the courtyard of the Justizpalast one morninga day or so later , punctually at seven o'clock . He was instructed , in an accompanying letter , to wear a Prince Albert and a top hat . Mrs. Andreas was shocked . " Guillotine ? Did you have to go ? " Dr. Reinmuth smiled and bowed to her . " No , I was not required . It was , you see , my right to go , as the advocateof the prisoner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eh , Reinmuth ? " And Dr. Reinmuth spread out his hands in a mock gesture of deprecation . " My fellow-spectators were three judges from the bench , " he continued , " who were dressed , like myself , in Prince Alberts and cylinders . We were a little early when we got to the courtyard , so that we saw the lastminutepreparations of the stage before the play began . Near the guillotine , with its great knife  --  that blade , my God in Heaven !  --  there stood a man in uniform with a drum , ready to drown out the sound if my client should yell . " The dimmest of frowns had gathered on Judge Crowell'sforehead . " All this pomp and circumstance for sixty pfennigs ? " he said . " Right you are , sir , " replied Dr. Reinmuth . " That is the irony of my story . " He paused to eat a strawberry and to take a sip of wine . " Next we watched them test the machine to make sure it was in proper  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released it , the cleaver came down with such stupendous force that the earth beneath our feet vibrated and my brains buzzed like a bee . " As the bells began to ring for seven , Herr Murderer was led out by two executioners , dressed as we were dressed . Their white gloves were spotless ! It was a gloriousmorning in May . The flowers were out , the birds were singing , the sky had not a cloud . To have your head cut off on such a day ! "  | " For sixty pfennigs ! " persisted the judge from Ohio . And Miss Dean , paling , stopped eating her dessert . " Mein Herr had been confessed and anointed . You could fairly see the holy oil on his forehead as his keepers led him across the paving to the guillotine . The drummer was ready . As the fourth note of the seven struck in the church towers , they persuaded him to take the position necessary to the success of Dr. Guillotin 's invention . One , he was horizontal ! Two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carcass and the blood shot out from the neck like a volcano , a geyser , the flame from an explosion . No sight I saw in the war was worse . The last stroke of seven sounded . There had been no need for the drum . " " Great Scott ! " said Mr. Andreas , and flushed . Captain McNaughton stared at Dr. Reinmuth and said , " You chaps do n't do things by halves , do you ? " Mrs. Andreas , frantic at the dangerous note that had sounded , menacing her party , put her hand lightly on the lawyer 's and said , " I know that then you must have fainted . " Dr. Reinmuth tilted back his head and smiled at the ceiling . " No . No , I did not faint . You remember that this was a beautiful day in spring ? And that I was a young man , all dressed up at seven in the morning ? " He lowered his head and gave his smile to the whole company . " Faint ! Dear lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I called my sweetheart on the telephone . " He gazed at his wife . " Liselotte was surprised , considering thep101hour . What are you thinking of ? It 's not eight o'clock , ' she said . I flustered her then . I said , I know it 's an unusualtime of day to call , but I have something unusual to say . Will you marry me ? ' " He clasped his hands together and exchanged with his wife a look as exuberant and shy as if they were in the first rapture of their romance , and , bewitched , she said , " Twenty years ago next May . " A silence settled on the room . Whether Evan Leckie was the more dumfounded by Dr. Reinmuth 's story of a majestic penalty to fit a sordid crime or by his ostentatioushinting at his connubial delights , he did not know . Evan sought the stunned faces of his countrymen and could not tell in them , either , what feeling was the uppermost . The party suddenly was no longer a whole ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans , and while the former outnumbered them , the Germans , in a deeper sense , had triumphed . They had joyfully danced a Totentanz , had implied all the details of their sixty-pfennig marriage , and they were still , even now , smiling at each other as if there had never been anythinguntoward in their lives . " I could take a wife then , you see , " said Dr. Reinmuth , by way of a denouement , " since I was a fullfledgedlawyer . And she could not resist me in that finery , which , as a matter of fact , I had had to hire for the occasion . " Judge Crowell lighted a cigarette , and , snatching at the externals of the tale , he said , " Did n't know you fel/lows used the guillotine as late as that . I 've never seen one except that one they 've got in the antiquarian place in Edinburgh . They call it the Maiden . " Dr. Reinmuth poured the very last of the Chablis into his glass , and , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nectar and I 've drunk it all . Sic transit gloria mundi. "  |p105In  the back yard of the lodging house , in the top of a dead tree , glib blackbirds swung in the wind on their individual twigs . Now and again , at some signal , they dropped to the ground but presently returned in a flutter of wings . Then the fancy would strike them to clear the tree , every man jack of them and off they would go like a whole company of hysterical busybodies . All the while they were fussing , big silver gulls sailed at their ease , high above them , descending occasionally to sit on the edge of a moored fishing boat that slowly turned round and round at the head of the little harbor . Some of the gulls set out to sea , as straight and sure in their flight as though a great hand carried them out beyond the causeway to the Sound . A savage sunset ignited the windows of defense plants across the water , caused derelict heaps of rubbish to glitter blindingly , smote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disheveled land . Although it was late in April and the day had been warm , the room was chilly and the stout doctor , shivering , drew the heavy Paisley shawl closer about his shoulders , sighed , and settled more firmly into the rockingp106chair by the window . Steadfastly he stared out . It would be self-indulgent to turn away in displeasure from all the symbols he read in his prospect , unprofitable to admitthe intrusion of homesickness or vexation . ( He had , of necessity , come to this twilight discipline ; in days past he had been so imprudent in his revery that he had often lost all perspective and had thought of the war as a deliberate insult to himself . ) And , indeed , it was not so much sad or vexing as it was puzzling that he , a homeless man , native of a distant country , was willynillya part of the " home front , " sharing richly in the spoils . As he followed the ascent of a helicopter , he marveledas frequently he did at the wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here people lived as headilyand impermanently as soldiers on battlefields . There seemed to be no natives unless the babies born here duringthis long pause could be called such . No indigenous architecture was visible . Probably it existed but it was hidden away behind blocks of temporary structures , by barrack-like apartment houses , sprawling into the yards of churches , huddling in the sulphurous shadows of factories . And although everything was new , made freshly for this especial period in the world 's history , it had a second-hand look . Houses , oil drums , buses , people seemed to have been got at a fire sale . There was a perpetual stirring in the lodging house . All the other tenants were defense workers , and the walls of the corridors were hung with warning pennants : " QUIET ! BULLARD WORKER ! HELP HIM HELP WINp107THE WAR ! " At the most unseemly hours  --  eleven at night , four in the morning  --  alarm clocks shrieked , taps gushed , feet crunched over the gravel of the driveway to the never ending stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early senility and they came from all over the country , from Harrisburg , Pennsylvania ; Pueblo , Colorado ; Mobile ; Galveston ; Wilmington , Delaware . They lived three to a room and six to a bathroom and because there were so many of them and their existence was so migratory , it was impossible to tell them apart , to give them more specific designations than " old " and " young , " " male " and " female . " Dr. Pakheiser from time to time received bits of informationabout them from the Hungarian manageress , Mrs. Horvath . She tossed them to him , dry and meatless , and did so without the least good humor . On the first floor there was ( or had been ) a Sikorsky worker who owned a fishing boat and on Sundays went to the Sound for bass . A lady accountant at Remington Arms had left her electric grill on for six hours and the pan that had been on it melted down to nothing , creating a fearful stink . A foreman at the Bunner Ritter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stomach . A girl at Chance Vought had , returning from a weekend in Massachusetts , seen a trainload of prisoners of war passing through the station in Providence and she had reported that they grinned shamelessly as if they were on a holiday . But the doctor did not know whether these adventures belonged to current tenants or to former ones , and if hep108had inquired further and had correctly assigned the histories to the right names and faces , it would have served no purpose ; by the time he was sure of his ground , they would have packed up their suitcases and moved away and immediately been replaced . He was sympathetic with their restlessness but sternly held himself detached from it . Had he not done so , he , too , probably would have wandered from one boarding house to the next like a sick person constantly shifting about in his bed trying to find a comfortable position for his aching bones . Refusing to think of himself as a " transient , " pretending that there would never be an end to the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chilliness of the house , the unpleasant manner of the manageress , the excessive rent , and had furthermore doggedly transformed the room into his room as if he were going to live in it the rest of his life . It was the first time in his three years of residence in America that he had accomplished the transformation , and it had not been easy . In former rooms , though , it had been impossible . This was like one in a hotel which defied any eccentricimpress , and in the beginning he had almost despaired , had been convinced that like all the others , it would remain inviolably and complacently itself and that when he finally went away , if his signature were there at all , it would be nothing more characteristic of him than of the tenants before him or the ones to follow : a half-used box of toothpowder and a rusted razor blade in the medicine chest , or on the desk a bottle ofp109ink or a glass ashtray bought for a dime . There was , upon everything , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mongrel . The walls were cream-colored plaster that could offend no one ; fastened to them here and there were besilvered lamps containing bulbs shaped like fat candleflames that shed a pale and genteel light . The rugs were scrupulously unobtrusive . The sturdy column of the standing lamp was embellished with twists of iron that represented nothing on earth , and the shade , seemingly designed to diminish illumination by exactly half , was silk of a color that could not be named , a color like one acquired by an amateur chemist or by a child experimenting with crayons . The ample bed ( too ample for his understanding . It was called a " three-quarter " bed and he wondered whether it was meant for two children or for someone prodigiously obese ) was covered with a faded counterpane made of two Indian prints sewn together . But the room had its virtues . The rocking chair was comfortable , the table was steady , and there were plenty of clothes hangers in the closet . And Mrs. Horvath kept everything clean . Aside from the fireplace which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only mirror which was hopelessly defective , and the writing desk which had a limping leg , everything was in " good working order . " The exterior of the house was equally noncommittal . It was large , shapeless and built of yellow stone . It stoodp110behind a high brick wall , its back windows overlooking an arm of the sea which , at low tide , was a black and stinking mud-flat . A dump had been made at the end of the water and here was heaped all the frightful refuse of the city , the high-heeled shoes and the rotten carrots and the abused insides of automobiles ; when the wind blew , the odor from the dump was so putrid in so individuala way that it was quite impossible to describe . But on a clear day , the doctor could look the other way and see , far off , the live blue Sound and the silhouettes of white sailboats and gray battleships . And while the plants , their windows ghastly blue all night , their noises constant every hour of every day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had at least the illusionof being in the country . For the lawns in front and in back were healthy , the trees were abundant , and forsythiawas blooming now along the wall . He had ponderedoften in the year he had lived here why so expensivea house ( for clearly it was that ; its plate glass and the intricate furbelows of its facade testified to suddenlyacquired money ) had been built on so unprepossessinga site , and at last he learned from a taxi-driver that the original owner had been a rum-runner who had brought his boats up the narrow neck of water and had unloaded them at the cottage in the back yard where now the Horvath family lived . While he was unable to find more than a humorous token in it , he thought with certain pleasure of the interview in which the house hadp111changed hands and become the property of the present landlord , a Roman Catholic priest . Sometimes , too , he wondered how the bootlegger would regard the changes he had made in his room , a room which perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal business . And how , for that matter , the priest did when he came on his monthly tour of inspection . Very likely both of them would find it prissy and impractical . He had taken down the pictureshe found there : a tinted photograph of the Grand Canyon ( which he thought must be the most dreadful sight in the world ) , a subdued study of an English cottageand one of a vase of asters . In their place he had hung a print of " The Siege of Toledo " and one of " The Fall of Icarus " and a photograph of the bridge in Wurzburg . On top of the bookcase were three decanters , for kummel , brandy and Dubonnet , a little white pot of philodendron , and a pewter tray on which stood two heavy wine glasses and a curious pipe . In the shelves were the few books he had brought with him from Ludwigshafen : Dante , Rilke , Plato , some medical books , Buddenbrooks , Crime and Punishment , The Charterhouseof Parma , and those he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of learning to read English easily . Those were For Whom the Bell Tolls , The Late George Apley , The Golden Treasury and The Story of San Michele . A cuckoo clock hung on the wall over the bed and on the bureau a large wooden nutcracker lay amongst big pecans in a polished lemonwood bowl . Onp112the bedside table were an ashtray he had bought in Milan , a brown earthenware carafe , a diary bound in green leather , and a silver letter opener . When , at nightfall , he drew the windowblinds against industrial America , it was not hard to imagine himself in his student room at Heidelberg . He had never been rich enough to eat at the town restaurants and he had disliked the tepid white food at the Mensa of the University , and so he had made little suppers for himself at his desk . And while now he was quite able to afford four-course dinners ( the dearth of doctors for civilians had contrived for him a flourishing and gainful practice amongst Hungarian defense workers and their pregnant wives ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of food he had done when he was a young man . Upon the table he would place the parcels he had brought from the delicatessen : a little sausage and a loaf of bread , a bottle of pickled tomatoes , a carton of Schmierkase , perhaps a jar of marinated herring . Then , his meal ready , he would pour himself a glass of Dubonnet , light an Egyptian Prettiest cigarette and sit for a while in the chair by the window , staring now at the dark green blind that was punctured here and there , admitting star-like bits of light . During the day , Dr. Pakheiser smoked American cigarettes , but he had found that nothing so completely and happily restored his student days to him as the smell of Oriental tobacco , and because he was so busy until he left his office , he could not afford time for the nostal/gic meditations it brought . Closing his eyes , he would fancy himself twenty years younger , not yet fat , but even now near-sighted , eating ham and bread and drinkingRotwein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frau Jost was a pretty , friendly young widow about whom he sometimes had romantic daydreams , and she had a daughter of four , a jolly little girl named Greta . Every morning , as Alfred left the house , Greta came to wish him good-by . She clutched in her arms a black cat who wore a red ribbon about its neck . And as he ran down the stairs , she always said , " Please look up at the window , Herr Pakheiser , and I will wave . " Outside , in the steep street , he had to hold his head far back so that he could see the top window , and there she was , on time and faithful every day , to wave her hand and smile at him , still holding her cat . Although those years at Heidelberg had been rich and full of importance , it was little Greta Jost that the flavor of the cigarette brought back most clearly . While he had had friends with whom he played chess at Burkhardt 's Konditorei and had drunk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had even occasionally had a girl , it was his daily encounter with the child that seemed now to fix the days of the past . He had been , even then , a person of strict habit . Once Greta had had chicken-pox and for a week had not appeared at the window , and all that time Alfred had been somewhat inattentive to his lectures and had spent more time at Burkhardt 's . But strangely enough , he had not reallyp114been fond of Greta  --  children , in general , made him shy  --  and he had even found himself wishing that the ritual had never been established since once it had been , it had to be repeated every day without fail for his completepeace of mind . He was even annoyed if the cat did not appear at the window or if it appeared without its ribbon . But what he would not give for Greta now ! With a perversity which he acknowledged frankly , he imagined that he had been devoted to her , that he had called her pet names and had dandled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother had been intimate . He could even long for the irascible porter at the medical college , for the torpid Badmeister at the public baths who invariably tried to give him a towel which someone else had just finished using . All these people . whom he had known slightly or not at all seemed , in his misshapenreflection , to be his friends . Dr. Pakheiser was not given to self-pity . A scientific man , he looked on facts . He knew that the Badmeister had no more been his friend than was Mrs. Horvath and that , in the end , Greta was the only one who had that stature . And just so now , twenty years later , he had again one friend , one companion , a solitary daily relationwith a breathing creature . His companion was a gray tom-cat who called on him each evening with the same unswerving regularity that had brought the little girl to the window every morning . The cat came at seven o'clock , announcing himself with a trilling mew outsidep115the door . He drank the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he spent the evening , until about midnight , curled up in the doctor 's lap , asleep . Two or three times in the course of the evening , he roused himself to make an excursion round the room , cleverly picking his way through the decanters , patting the trailing leaves of the philodendron to watch them sway . He washed a little and returned and slept again . Half-roused by the turning of a page or the sound of a match being struck , he would briefly purr as if to say that his affection had not lessened , that he was merely preoccupied . At midnight , Dr. Pakheiser took him downstairs , dropped him on the veranda and watched him , revivedby the night air , streak across the lawn and disappearover the wall . The doctor called him Milenka which in Russian , of which he knew a few words , means " darling . " He knew too little Russian , even , to affix the masculine diminutive . " Milenka , " he would say , " I-yi-yi-yi , had puss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an ordinary gray cat with white mittens , a white snout and a shell-pink nose . He was rather ugly , for he was underdeveloped and rangy and since he spent a good part of the day in the coal bin , his paws were always smudged . But he had a full , healthy purr and a gentle nature . Rarely did he strop his claws on the carpet , and thanks to the doctor 's weekly application of One Spot powder , he had very few fleas . Dr. Pakheiser realized once with half-ashamed amuse/ment that he had for Milenka a real love , whereas for Greta he had had only a perfunctory gratitude . It was chiefly , he supposed , because he was the cat 's protector as well as his friend and had it not been for his suppers of cream and herring , the poor thing would have had to shift for himself on the dump . Indeed , he was quite sure that if he moved away , Mrs. Horvath would have the cat destroyed , for she had not known , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she would have an animal to care for as well as beds and bathtubs . No one knew where Milenka had come from . The landlord disclaimed all knowledge of him ; the former manageress denied that she had ever fed him or invited him in any way to stay . The doctor neither liked nor disliked animals . He had always been indifferent to them , save for police dogs whom he feared and cocker spaniels whom he scorned for their somehow homosexual softness . He had never known an individual dog or cat well . So this strong feeling about Milenka perplexed him . Was he turning into an old lady ? And would he , together with his cat-fancying , get notions before he was fifty ? But these speculations did not really worry him ; he was sure that his fundamental motive in helping the cat survive was that he did not like Mrs. Horvath and by his lavish purchases of fish and cream , he was deviously repaying her for her impertinences . Mrs. Horvath was a dirty , dumpy person in a brown coverall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most extraordinarily forthright way Dr. Pakheiser had ever seen . On the first day of her regime she had been introduced to the doctor by the departing manageress , and she had said , " I think you are Jew , Doctor . But I get rent every Wednesday all same . You do n't worry . " Each time he recollected this speech ( delivered with a smile which could not have disarmed a child ) he was so taken aback that he was never able to analyze exactly what she meant . Evidently it was her intention to announceher antipathy to Jews at the very outset so that her tenant would not start off under a misapprehension . It became clear , after a few days , that her rule was firm : she decidedly was not one of those people who say , " Some of my best friends are Jews . " On the contrary , she would say , " I hate all Jews . " In a way , he preferred her attitude to that , say , of his office girl , Miss Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on being one of the chosen people . With Mrs. Horvath , he was dealing with an armed enemy and war , with her , was war . Miss Johnson , on the other hand , while less wounding , was more treacherous . She could catch him offguard when he was fatigued and , sympathizing with him for being uprooted from his country , could make him prey to a burning , unobjectified anger on behalf of his whole race , and to a weepy grief for himself . Then he would despise America , Connecticut , his cramped and cluttered office , the strapping great charwoman who cleaned it , the smell of workmen in the waiting roomp118and of workmen 's cigarettes , but most of all he would despise Miss Johnson . Milenka was the immediate cause of war between Mrs. Horvath and Dr. Pakheiser . About two weeks after her arrival , she came one evening to collect the rent . Seeing the cat curled up on the pillow of the bed , she wrinkled her low forehead , bunched up her flat Magyar nose and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat . But outside . Not in the house . In Europe , we have dog , we have cat , but all outside . Inside they make their doing on the carpet and all where . Outside , Doctor , I must ask you . " Dr. Pakheiser , unnerved , a man who preferred on all occasions to agree , cried , " I see ! " and pretended to himself that this was only a humorous crotchet she was airingconversationally . But she remained firm in the doorwayeven after he had given her the money and then , so suddenly that he scarcely realized what was happening , she bounded forward toward the bed , shrieking , " Out ! Out , you ! " and Milenka , his eyes widening with terror , leaped from the bed and ran out the door . The next evening , though , admitted to the house by the man who left for the graveyard shift at Chance Vought , the cat came back , and the doctor , emboldened by his desire for company and his need for continuing custom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Wednesday when the rent was due , he came and was not turned away . Mrs. Horvath , to be sure , was aware of what was going on . In the morning when the doctor went downstairs , he usually found her indolentlyp119flicking a dust cloth over the newel post or frankly readingthe lodgers ' postal cards or sitting , sprawled like a big tom-boy , in one of the chairs of the foyer . She would give him a look half scornful , half angry and would say , " I do n't know what happen to you when Father come and see those places on the carpet with sausage marks . " Or she would tell him , jeeringly , that Father was going to be outraged when he saw the hole in the curtain the cat had clawed . " I tell you , Doctor , " she would say , " on the grass , okay when they lose their hair . Outside , all right . Inside , on the cushions , hell 's bells ! " Sometimes she would simply ask him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How you find Milenka last night , Doctor ? Plenty good fleas on him , eh ? " And once , reaching the limit of her insolence , she followed him out the door and paced up the driveway , calling shrilly , " Milenka ! Milenka ! " When he was not in school , the manageress was accompanied by her thirteen-year-old son , a large boy with a malicious face that forever grinned under a sailor cap . Occasionally it was he who came for the rent and Dr. Pakheiser , fumbling in his wallet , felt that the boy with his obscene leer had expected to find dirty French pictures on the wall or a light woman in the bed . " Hey , Doc , " he said once , " you like that cat ? " And the doctor , laughing violently , replied , " Ach , yes ! Very much . " Freddie continued . Pretty soon now " that cat " had betterwatch its step for he was going to trap and tame some birds and if that dope of an old gray dumbbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat . " Dr. Pakheiser , baffled by the assurance of the outsized youth , cried , " Ach , so ! " louder and more amiably than ever . So far , no birds had been caught , but Freddie , on Saturday and Sunday , worked all day long making his traps out of wooden crates , and in time the back yard was so full of them that it appeared he intended to catch entire flocks . And the doctor had no doubt either that Milenka would chase the birds or that Freddie would cruelly punish him . On this damp April evening , Dr. Pakheiser was about to draw his windowblinds and prepare his supper when he saw Mr. Horvath come out of the cottage bringing a step-ladder which he set up underneath an apple tree . At his approach , the blackbirds all flew off , twittering irritably . Some time before , he had built a bonfire at the water 's edge which now was burning brightly , sending up bits of charred paper , like smaller blackbirds . The man called out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Freddie came charging through the door , wearing a baseball mitt on one hand . There was a colloquy which the doctor could not hear and then the boy , rushing to the bonfire , hurling his mitt to the ground , cried , " Oh , boy ! " He lighted a torch and came back to the stepladder , sedately so that the flame would not go out , handed it to his father and then climbed up . At the top , he wavered a little and let out an exclamation of fright , ,  |p121but  he regained his balance and stooped down to receive the torch . He was just tall enough to reach the puffy white tent of caterpillars in a high crotch of the tree . The doctorwatched , sickened , saw yellow flames shoot up as the fat tumor caught fire . Freddie had not thought ahead . A worm fell upon his upturned face and he screamed with revulsion and let the torch drop to the ground where it went on burning and sending up black smoke . The work , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death with the back of a shovel where they had fallen in the grass , the boy came down the ladder and went toward the cottage , wiping his face with both hands as though it never would be clean again . Mr. Horvath laughed at him and went on killing the pests . Mrs. Horvath came to the screen door and hooted at her son , " Ha ! Ha ! " she laughed . " You keep the mouth open next time and see what comes in . " Restored to his normalspirits , Freddie hooted back , " Yeah , like fun I will ! Yeah , in a pig 's valise I will ! " There was a miaow at the doctor 's door . He drew down the windowblind sharply , shuddering at what he had just seen . There was something primeval in those people ; their communal enjoyment of the annihilation of the caterpillars was so stupid and so brutish that the doctor actually retched . Then he let in the refined , softmovingcat . " I-yi-yi-yi ! " he said , stooping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puss , my bad boy . " Milenka stretched his head forward and rubbed the top of itp122against Dr. Pakheiser 's chin , purring loudly . " Milenka , " murmured the man . " Ah , my good friend , my dearest one . " He poured the cream into the cereal bowl , fetched a quart of Irish ale from the window sill and , sitting down , said to his companion , " Gut ' Mahlzeit . " When they had both finished and the doctor had put away the food , he settled once more in the rocking chair with the brandy decanter at his elbow . He opened the journal that had come that day and began methodically with the first article , one on the use of sulfa drugs in the treatment of sinusitis . He had read only a few sentenceswhen Milenka leaped to his lap . Dr. Pakheiser ran his fingers under the cat 's jaw and around the ears , laid his whole hand on the little gray belly to feel the vibration and read on , at last in repose now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneasiness stirring at the back of his mind and although he concentrated and extracted the full meaning from all he read that night , he observed when he rose at twelve to put Milenka out that he had drunk three times as much brandy as was his custom and had made a great inroad into the package of Egyptian Prettiests which he never smoked after supper . That night he had a strange dream . He dreamed of D-day . He and little Greta Jost had come to wish Mr. Horvath good luck and they had set out to find rooms . The hotels were crowded , for the holiday throngs were tremendous . They sauntered up the boardwalk , admiringthe bright tailored shingle where fashionable peoplep123were gathered for the start of the regatta . They entered a hotel which was quite deserted save for a man sitting alone on a little mezzanine at one end of the lobby . He sat at a round amethyst-colored glass table , drinking a very pink cocktail , and as they approached , he stood up smiling and cordially extending his hand . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both by name . His address was old-fashioned : he said " Miss Greta " and " Mr. Alfred . " Linking arms , the three of them went out . The President said that while he wished the invasion to be as leisurely as possible , it would be folly , would it not , to give the signal too late in the day ? Did not his young friends agree that despite our great advances in electricity , there was somethingessentially better about sunlight ? Never was there so civilized a man ! In the pure , brilliant sky , exquisite airplanes circled and swooped like the loveliest of birds . There was such a profusion of scarlet ! In the flags , in the hats of the spectators , on the wings of planes , in colossalbouquets in vases a mile high situated on the beach at intervals of fifteen yards . The yachts were all ready , freshly painted , brightly bannered for the race to Europe . Alfred and Greta were the first to land . As they walked up the ramp , he noticed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they could not find the Konditorei he had suggested although time and time again they set forth from the Heiliggeist cathedraland took the familiar street . Nor was it pos/sible , as formerly , to see the ruined castle from the bridge , and Greta said , " Herr Pakheiser , I do n't believe this is Heidelberg . Now I am afraid and I want my mother . I think we have come to Heilbronn by mistake . " But Alfred pointed to the marking that clearly read , " Philosophen Weg , " and he soothed her , " Do n't be frightened , dearest . " They were speeding in a dirty expresstrain through Freiburg , its towers and steeples flattened out like any corpse , its vineyards wasted with drought and disease . The Alps diminished as they neared them . No trees were left . The sun was small and red like an ember . Alfred , receiving a wicker-covered jug of wine from a weeping man who shared their compartment , was too touched and too embarrassed to begin a conversation , but at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said solemnly , " sir , did you ever go fishing in the Sound for bass , using a caddis worm as bait ? " The wine in the man 's throat gurgled like a death rattle as he looked out at the leveled mountains . " There was a short notice in some review or other , " he said , " outlined in black . Even so . . . even so . . . " In the limbo where he waited a moment before he wakened fully , he thought he was writing the opening paragraph of a children 's story in which a little boy lay on his stomach drinking water from a stream . Suddenlyhis eyes encountered two others , hooded , sparkling with some horrible intelligence . They belonged to a monstrouscaddis worm which advanced through the water as he withdrew.  |p125He  woke violently . He clasped his hands to his forehead and in the darkness softly moaned . " I must control myself . I must not perish here . " Late in May , Milenka disappeared . Dr. Pakheiser was disturbed but not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . On the fifth morning he diffidently asked Mrs. Horvath if she had seen the cat , and he detected something doubtful , something covert in her reply . She was not arrogant and her eyes seemed unable to focus on his face . She said  --  uncomfortably , it seemed to him  --  " No , Doctor . I see him Sunday . My husband see him Sunday . He come back , do n't you worry . " Then she looked directly at him and smiled , " He know where his sardine is , I tell you . " The doctor was smoking and as he went to the table to drop a long ash into the tray there , his hand abruptly shook and the ashes fell to the carpet . He and the woman both briefly looked at them , dispersed fanwise on the green border . And he knew then that she was hiding something , for she did not reproach him for his clumsiness even though she had just finished using the carpet sweeper . He was so angry that he stumbled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to lean against the jamb a moment before he could see the steps . It was not , at this moment , that he was mourning the loss of Milenka ; it was that he had sensed , despite her near-civility and his own timorousness , as killing a hatred between them as126though they were two jungle beasts , determined to destroyone another . " If she has killed my cat , " he brooded as he drove through the gate , " then I . . . " but he could not finish the sentence . He could devise no penalty high enough for such wickedness , no penance sufficiently humiliating . For two weeks nothing passed between the manageress and her lodger . Nothing , that is , but glances boldly indignanton the doctor 's part , guilty on the woman 's . It seemed to him that the life of the rest of the house had ceased , that all was at an ominous standstill before a final battle to the death . And then , incredibly , the cat came back . When he first heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Pakheiser could not believehis ears . Not until the sound had been repeated two or three times did he open the door . His joy at the reunion was less than his shame for falsely accusing Mrs. Horvath and less than his bewilderment at her shifty-eyed embarrassment . Apparently Milenka had just wandered off somewhere as tom-cats do in the spring . He was thin and mangy and his coat was matted with cockleburs and beggar's-lice . His purr had a bronchial rasp and the doctor made a note on his memorandum pad to bring home a worm pill the next night . Nor had he any appetite for the bit of herring which was all that the doctor had to offer him , and after less than half an hour , he asked to be let out . But this strangeness , under good care , would pass . That night the doctor slept well . " Good morning , " he cried heartily as he met Mrs.p127Horvath in the hall the following day . " Have you seen my friend , Mrs. Horvath ? He came back for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes opened from their sleepiness , her lips parted in disbelief , and she said , " Back ? That cat back ? " Dr. Pakheiser assured her that what he said was true and at that moment , to confirm him , Milenka leaped to the window sill from the veranda and sat there in profile , blinking his eyes . Mrs. Horvath stared , " I do not know , " she said . " It is like a dream . " The doctor surmised , then , that the cat had been put into a bag and taken into the country somewhere and been abandoned . It was scarcely believable that he could be so gross as to laugh triumphantly and almost to sob his words : " Yes , Mrs. Horvath , my dearest friend is restored to me ! " She looked away from the window . " But , Doctor , I do not know . My son , he catch birds all while now . His school finish pretty soon . I think he do n't want that cat here . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no longer tyrannized over by her now that he had got his cat back . " And I want him here even if that boy does n't . " It gave him pleasure to say " that boy " just as she and her son spoke of " that cat . " " But , Doctor , the cat kill birds . My boy do n't kill them . He make them into good pet . " " It is the cat 's nature to kill birds . But it is not the nature of man to take prisoners . "  | " No ? " she said . The look of cunning returned to her face . " What we fight war for , then , Doctor ? " " I do n't know , Mrs. Horvath , I am sure . " He was overpowered with disgust that he should be haggling with this obtuse woman over the life of a diseased cat , and that he should be confronted by so irrelevant a questionwhich he could not answer and which , in spite of its fatuous context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not know , like an unprepared schoolboy , his mind was growing dull . And just as he was preparing to bid the manageress good morning and to hurry to his office to plunge himself into work , she threw out a remark more imbecilic than the first but one that utterly confounded him . She said , " My son protect birds from cats just like America protect Jews from Hitler . " For a moment , before he had collected himself , he read an awful symbolic wisdom into this absurdity . Unhamperedby learning , in a country where she could not read the language and could barely speak it , where she could be influenced only by the most basic of national prejudices and loyalties , she was truly a natural enemy . Here was the perfect , the pure hatred ; the real thing was in Mrs. Horvath 's simple heart . He was not so far gone yet as to think that she was bent on getting rid of the cat out of vengeance . Her reasons were more human than that ; she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But at the same time , there was something so sure in her figure of speech that it was as if , from now on ,  |p129she  would implicitly believe it , would even repeat it in later conversations . In reply , Dr. Pakheiser only smiled . On his way out , he gave Milenka a pat on the head and said loudly , " I-yi-yi-yi , bad puss ! " and walked jauntily round the house to his car , whistling . Whistling , as the phrase went , in the dark . All spring , Dr. Pakheiser trod on eggs . Each evening when he came home and parked his car in the back yard where Freddie was at work on his bird traps , his heart constricted with apprehension . This would be the night , he thought , when Milenka would not come . The boy , grinning even as he pounded in the nails , looked up with a dispassionate greeting . " Hi , Doc . This is for me to get me an oriole in , see ? And that there one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I lure ' em  --  I know how they whistle and I whistle and they think I 'm a bird  --  and then they get in this little place here , see , and I pull a string and the door comes down and they ca n't get out . And then I get ' em so tame they 'll eat right out of my hand . " Once or twice the doctor inquired about his school with the intention of keeping things running smoothly between them . He went to the nuns to whom he referred collectively as " Sister . " " Sister flunked me in Latin but she gave me B in Algebra and D plus in English . " But it bored him to talk about the contents of his days ; he would break off suddenly and pointing to the blackbirds in the dead tree would say , " See them ? I do n't want ' em but I could have ' em all if I did . " Andp130the doctor would look up at the crowded branches , objectof his dreamy contemplation every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say as he threw a pebble into the tree and they all disbanded . " They do n't know where they 're at . " Dr. Pakheiser would reply , " I do n't think any birds at all know where they 're at . " They had come to this conventional rite through a mutual understanding : the doctor disliked birds , the boy disliked cats . Neither spoke of his aversion , but under their banter was the serious warning , " Your pet stays where it belongs , or else . " Milenka was soon prospering . His coat came in soft and shining ; his purr cleared and his eyes lost the milkinessthat had clouded them when he first came home . He was full grown now and , obliged to assume the responsibilities of a male animal , sometimes missed a meal and spent the time with a plump old tabby who howled for him on the stone wall . But good friend that Milenka was , if he failed to come one evening , he sneaked through the door early the next morning when someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy these morning visits even more than the evening ones . He would go back to bed after he had poured out the cream and lie there watching ; when the cat had finished , he would jump to the bed , walk carefully up Dr. Pakheiser 's legs to the thigh and there establish himself . But there was one drawback to his coming in the daytime . Ironically , a pair of wrens had built a nest under the eave of the corner window and Milenka , hear/ing them rustle and chirp , would sit up , his whiskers twitching , his sleek little body poised for a leap . And whenever this happened , Dr. Pakheiser felt a thrill of disquiet , afraid the cat would commit a crime during the day while he was at his office and could not intercede for him . Just as Milenka thrived , so did Freddie 's successes multiply and by the first of June , the clumsy home-made cages in the garage were half full of orioles and robins and finches and flickers which , at feeding time , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when school was over for him and the skies were full of birds , Freddie stalked a robin in full view of the doctor 's windows . He crept across the lawn on his hands and knees toward the large unmoving bird . The advance could either have been for the purpose of murderor for ministration to an injured wing . It was beautifulto watch . There was no sudden nervous jerking , no change of pace . When he was within two feet of the bird , his hands left the ground and his lips parted in his earnestness . His posture and his skill made the doctorthink of a praying mantis , one of those miraculously ugly creatures which he had seen on the road under a tulip tree and had taken at first for withering seed pods . Now , a foot away , the hands parted . He was ready for the capture . Dr. Pakheiser found himself holding his breath and could not tell whether he wanted the bird to foil the boy or wished to see it taken . Directly under the certain hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently took the bird . Freddie stroked its head tenderly with his forefinger and when the captive made a movement to escape , he drew it to his chest smilingrapturously . And the doctor might have warmed toward him , seeing the innocent happiness in his face , had he not bawled out , " Hey , Mom ! Got me another one . Boy , oh , boy , am I good ! " Its head high , its tail feathers trailing the ground , the great cock-pheasant moved with dignity out of the shadow of the apple tree into the light where all the glory of its habiliments shone like a sun-struck diamond . Dr. Pakheiser , who had been roused early by an urgent telephone call , paused in his dressing to watch the wonderfulbird . He had never seen one before save in pictureswhich he had not altogether believed . The japanningof its plumage had been masterful : emerald blazed forth beside gold and gold beside scarlet . There was something about it so rich and unusual that he did not think of it as a bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bright grass where now it stopped , surveying the terrain as if this were its own dominion . But the kingly creature was no wiser than its plebeian brothers , and it began to walk rapidly toward one of Freddie 's traps . The doctor immediately flung wide his window , unfastened the screen and leaned out , shouting and waving his arms to scare away the foolish bird . He disturbed the sleeping wrens in the eave and they flewp133wildly against the screen , then sailed off to the apple tree . But the pheasant was deaf to warnings and walked complacently toward his prison . In a frenzy , Dr. Pakheiserreached back to the bedside table and picked up his metal ashtray from Milan . He hurled it at the pheasant . It fell close to the quick feet and instantly the bird turned , running , this time , back over the grass through the shadow of the apple tree and disappeared in the tall weeds that grew about the abandoned boats . Freddie ran out of the cottage . The doctor fastened his screen and stepped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he watched the boy whose face was contortedwith fury and frustration . Tears began as he picked up the ashtray . For a second he stared at it as if he were not sure what to do with it and then , with a bawl , he flung it into the water which was at low tide and , cursing at the top of his voice , went indoors . Dr. Pakheiser finished dressing . He knew that he was not steady enough to shave , but he washed his face and hands slowly and thoroughly , using the nail brush with unaccustomed vigor . He lighted a cigarette and sat down , aware that his delay was selfish . But his patient seemed remote , the illness unimportant . It was not until the cigarette had burned down to nothing that he got up , found his hat and went out . He stole quietly down the stairs and round the house . There was no sign of life in the back yard . From within the cottage came the sound of Mrs. Horvath 's voice ; she spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Hep134gained his car and he was safe . But he knew that the score was not yet settled , for as he drove away , he saw Freddie 's face at the window , the strange Mongolian nose spread out as it pressed against the pane . This , finally , would be the day of reckoning . When he came home at five that afternoon , Dr. Pakheiserfound both Mrs. Horvath and Freddie in the large front bedroom downstairs . Someone had just moved out and they were making it ready for a new tenant . They were turning the mattress , but when they saw the doctor , they stopped , the great thing folded halfway over and held in their strong red hands . Mrs. Horvath said , " Good night , Doctor . I bring you ashtray tomorrow . You lose your blue one ? " He had not anticipated so devious an attack and he was nonplused . Since all three of them knew well enough that the ashtray was lying in the mud , it was absurd to carry on her game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the office . And so he replied ambiguously , " Oh , thank you . If you have an extra one , I will be glad to have it . " He started toward the stairs , but they had not finished with him yet . Mrs. Horvath said , " Was it a good day , Doctor ? " " A busy day , " he said . " But , yes , a good one , I think . " The boy , his chin upon the mound of the mattress , fixed him with the fearless eye of the insulted child and slowly said , " It was n't a good day for me , Doctor . It was a bad day for me , was n't it , Mom ? "  |p135His  mother giggled and winked at Dr. Pakheiser . " His birds ! He think of nothing but his birds . Today he do n't catch one big pheasant and this evening another get out of her house and fly away . " " Oh , I 'm sorry , " said the doctor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem so tame . They eat out of your hand , do n't they ? " " That bird wo n't come back , " said the boy . " I know what happened to him . That cat got him . You get a bird tame and if it gets out anybody can catch it . " The cold , accusing face began to contract in a childish pucker and tears hindered the next words : " That damned cat ate my bird ! " He wrenched the mattress out of his mother 's hands and flung it back onto the springs and flung himself upon it , sobbing maniacally . " And if I catch that cat , I 'll kill it ! I 'll kill it ! I 'll kill it ! " The doctor flushed with embarrassment at this display , unchecked by the mother who merely stood smilingbeside the bed . In time , the tantrum spent itself and Freddie lay shaking , face down on the naked bed . In the quiet , Mrs. Horvath , deceptively matter-of-fact , said , " Doctor , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He say Hitler do n't like women , only men ? You think that true , Doctor ? " He could not chart her course , begun so remotely . He stalled , took off his glasses and put them on again . She went on . " I hate Hitler , Doctor . But I do not believe all what they say . This book I buy in the drugstore for onep136dollar ninety-eight cents . I think a Jew write the book out of madness for what Hitler do to Jews . " If only he could turn his leaden flesh and carry it up the stairs to his own room and lock the door upon these savages ! There rest , there drink his Dubonnet , there be at home ! But a score of weights held him immobile , facingthe barbarous woman and he listened to her : " I hate Hitler , " she repeated . " I like Jews . But if you 're mad you do n't all times tell the truth , is n't it ? So this doctor in this book I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of that , Doctor ? " She went on and on . Unskilledas were her thrusts , they were direct . And when at last she was finished and had dismissed him ( did she , he wondered , in her marvelously malicious mind think that perhaps he was the " doctor of Hitler " ? Or that he did not like women , only men ? ) he felt trampled upon . Actually he ached and when he got to his room , he was sure he was coming down with something . Never in all these three years had his loneliness been so acute . It sprained his whole body , buried his faculties so deeply that sensation , if it came at all , was ambiguous and incomplete . Impassively , he accepted the anonymous voices of machines : radios , motor boats , factory whistles , trains , a random bomber . They came to him thickly insulated so that , shrill or loud as they might really be , they did not penetrate his mind but lay , all of them together , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep-burdened eyes or attached themselves with imbecilic fixity upon one trivial object.  |p137For  a long time he studied a minute fissure in the plaster of the wall beside the window . Later , he meditated intentlyupon the small , dispirited American flag on a pole beside the Sikorsky plant , and when at last he broke from this trance , it was only to become absorbed in the spectacle of a fouled old fish-bucket raffishly perched on a stump at the water 's edge . Once , from some remote region of the house , there came the sound of a music box tinkling over a radio and at least a hundred times he stubbornly reiterated the words he knew it heralded : " PEPSI COLA HITS THE SPOT . " At last , passing his hand over his cool forehead , he closed his eyes . The sounds cohered as in delirium . He could still visualize the blackbirdsand fancied them to be a deathless band of flies which refused to walk upon the glass where they could be swatted . Hearing a train screaming in the station for passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Bismarckgarten waiting for the yellow tram to Mannheim , but all he could see , in his mind 's eye , were the shabby girls at the flowerstall deftly plucking daffodilsfrom the pails of water . Next , he pretended that the train he heard was the express to Munich , and this time the recollections spun out effortlessly . He had gone to Salzburg once for a fortnight at the house of a classmate , a yellow-haired boy named Heine Waffenschmidt . He remembered that in the compartment there had been two soldiers on leave who had played chess the whole journey and had gladly drunk the wine offered to them by a tipsy letter-carrier on his way to **27;6850;TOOLONG to see his tubercular daughter who was dying . The old man 's blue coat glistened with age and the brass buttons on it were so tarnished that when the light fell on them they did not shine . " Danke , Papa , " the soldiers had said . Once , at the end of a game , they stretched and yawned and told the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said one of them , " what do you think ? We have hired a cafe and ordered a keg of Lowenbrau and we 'll have Scotch whisky besides . " Dr. Pakheiser remembered how whenever the train stopped at a station , the pause seemed as clearly defined as a box ; his eyes burned now as if he were looking up at the bright blue ceiling light . It was hard to redeem much of the two weeks in Salzburg . He had been happy , he was quite sure , and dimly he recalled a ski tournamentafter which he and Heine had gone to a rathskeller for Gluhwein . There had been a troop of players on their way to Danzig and one of them , an effeminate young man , had described the jumpers he had seen that afternoon . " Und er ge/at so and so and so ! " he said , gesturing with his hands . " ' Swar unglaublich wunder-bar . " The memory was flat and he rejected it . He tried to think of his patients , but could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always wrong . The electricityunaccountably went off or the water ran rusty or the windows got stuck . Today Miss Johnson had worn an artificial rose in her hair and he had already beenp139so nervous that the sight of it had nearly sent him into a tailspin . He had a glass of brandy which quieted his fidgeting hands . The smoke from the flat Egyptian Prettiest gave off a fragrance like sweet wood , but tonight , it did not bring back Greta . Through the open windows came sharply the sound of Mr. Horvath 's voice warning his son who was clipping the hedge . " Watch out for snakes , Freddie . " The shears clicked steadily ; the boy was a good worker . With his glass in his hand , the doctor went to the window and stood beside it looking out . The appallinggrin had come back to Freddie 's face in which there were no signs of sorrow or even of anger . Once he stood up straight to rest his back from its stooping positionand the big clippers dangled by their handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brandy and even then had not had enough to drink , so he replaced the empty decanter with the one half full of kiimmel . He thought of the supper he soon would eat and he began to wonder what the Horvath family had upon their table . For some reason , he had an idea they were fond of mussels ( which made him ill ) and he was positive they enjoyed the displeasing flavor of celeriac in their soup . They would have chunks of fat meat ; they would especiallylike rutabaga , watermelon , molasses , pancakes and hot tamales . Again , he wondered if they ever bathed . He had frequently seen Mrs. Horvath 's wash hanging on the line in the back yard and had been certain that shep140used neither soap nor hot water in her laundry . He suspected that they did not brush their teeth which were very long and extremely black . He did not , to tell the truth , altogether understand why the United States had given Mr. Horvath citizenship . The sun went down and the helicopters left the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noise in his room and , conscious that he was quite drunk , he allowed his full lips to curl into a smile as he thought of the pleasure Milenka would have if this were a mouse he might catch for his first course . The sound came again , a faint rustling . He thought at first it was in the closet , but then , at its repetition , concluded that it was in the fireplace . Rather slowly , for his hands were awkward , he took away the flowered screen and looked in at the bare , clean hearth . The sound continued , close beside him . He stuck his head in the opening and listened and it came again . There was no doubt about it , something was trapped in the chimney . He returned to his chair in indecision and poured out another glass of kiimmel and considered . He knew that it was Freddie 's lost bird , beatingits wings against the walls . The boy had left the hedge and his shears lay atop the formal leaves . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this very moment , spooning up the repellent sauce that surrounded their mussels ? ) so there was still time in which to choose between an armistice and revenge . For a few minutes the man sat still in his rockingchair , listening tensely to the desperate wings . Butp141presently he could endure the creature 's agony no longer and he left his room , having decided to drive a bargain with the boy . From the top of the stairs , Dr. Pakheiser could see through the window to the left of the front door . Milenka was sitting on the wall , looking archly down at the tabby who crouched in the grass . " I-yi-yi-yi , bad puss , " he thought . His feet were slow on the steps and he clutched the bannister with an unnaturally moist hand . He was halfway down when Mr. Horvath came into his ken . The large man moved soundlessly around the corner of the house and stood at the edge of the lawn under a young elm tree , and in a moment , Freddie joined him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time it took Mr. Horvath to aim and fire and then , in order not to see the body fall off the wall , turned and went back to his room . Late , after the Chance Vought worker had gone to the graveyard shift , Dr. Pakheiser opened the damper of the fireplace and a dead oriole fell to the hearth . He gazed abstractedly at the black and golden feathers and touched the soft body with the fire tongs . A bright apple leaf was caught under one wing . He picked the bird up carefully with a piece of newspaper and put it in a box which he found on the shelf of his closet . He carried the box downstairs and into the back yard and he floated it on the water , blue with the lights from the factory windows . He pondered if it would float to the Sound and if it did , how far it would go then . A mile on the wayp142to Europe ? Halfway ? " Go , Milenka , " he addressed the box which already had drifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head cleared a little and he felt a wonderful exhilaration as if he had been freed of a persistent pain . He ran like a young man back to the house , took the stairs two at a time and when he got to his room , he lay down without undressing and at once was fast asleep.  |p145At  five in the morning in February , it is darker than at midnight . The streets are empty of automobiles ; the latest readers have gone to bed and the earliest risers are only just opening their eyes . The few people abroad are swift and furtive , like creatures who must quit a place before the sun shines forth . At that hour , their business seems mysterious and even shady , although they are not cutthroats or thieves but only watchmen and charwomen and night waitresses on their way home to dine at sunrise . So uncluttered are the streets , so starkly direct is the walk of the people that anyone whose customit is to get up much later , at the normal hour , feels when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but meaningful privacy . And a light , springing on abruptlyto make a staring eye in a blackened building , may stir him with embarrassment and wonder as if this were an alarm or an esoteric signal of hostility . It was cold and the girl was hungry . She paused in the vestibule of the apartment building and half turned to unlock the outer door again and go back to her warm bed . But as she lingered , she observed a bright blue star high over the houses opposite and the sight inexplicablyp146gave her resolution , even though its color was so pure and frigid that it made her all the more conscious of the cold . She drew on her gloves and went out , shocked by a biting gust of wind which passed her by like a big rapid bird . She turned the corner and hurried along Sixth Avenue on her way to the first mass . Although the star , which was now behind her , had had a decisive effect on her , it had not dispelled her apprehensionand her distrust of the unfamiliar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath was erraticand her ears were fanciful , making her think she heard sinister noises behind the blank faces of the buildings . She looked straight ahead , fearful of what she might see in the dark doorways and even in the interiors of delicatessens and bakery shops whose cheerless windowswere dimly silvered by the street-lights . And still , discomforting as it was , she took a certain pleasure in her uneasiness , feeling that even the most accidental castigation was excellent at the beginning of Lent . On the corner of Thirteenth Street , there was a large second-hand shop whose windows she had many times studied with an incredulous amusement , so dreadful and so undesirable were the objects displayed there : funeralwreaths made of human hair , armadillo baskets , back-scratchers that looked like sets of bad teeth , ceramic vessels of an unimaginable function . The antelope with eaten ears and rubbed-off hide , the alabaster boar and the complacent Chinese philosopher made of porcelainp147stared out , looking , even at five in the morning , for someone to adopt them and give them a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunken beggar sprawled like a lumpy rug , his feet in ruptured tennis shoes thrust out onto the sidewalk . He was not asleep . Under a cap set raffishly at an angle on his head , he regarded the girl 's approach with an eye made visible to her by the arc light at the intersection . Paradoxically , her pace slowed down as her terror rose , and the man had risen to his feet before she was abreast of him . The smell of whisky was so strong that it was like a taste in her mouth . He stretched forth his hand and whined , " Lady , I 'm hungry , lady . " She did not carry a purse , but in her pocket were two dimes and a quarter . She intended to put the quarter into the poor box and the dimes in the candle offering , for she wished to light a candle for the repose of her mother 's soul and another for the safe-keeping of two friends , captive in China by the Japanese . Although it was only a fraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an individual emotion attending each revolved through her mind . She saw the poor box in the dim vestibule of the lower church and heard her quarter click upon the other coins . This box was stationedbeside the holy water font , near by the statue of Our Lord between whose palely gleaming feet someone placed fresh flowers each day . Then she saw her mother lying in the limbo of her last hours , unsightly , unconsoled , and heard the sonorous matter-of-factness of herp148Protestant relatives to whom this transformation , so unbearableto her , was neither strange nor dreadful . It was not that they did not grieve their kinswoman , but it was that they had many times before known death and had learned , through its reiteration , that it was no wonder . She , still bedewed with baptism , had knelt and the blue beads of her rosary slipped through her fingers until her mother 's soul abandoned its wrecked flesh . She had been , she remembered , in the middle of the fourth decade when her aunt , vigilant at the bedside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And she remembered how the odor of belladonna had obtruded so in her devotions that part of her mind pronounced the word over and over as if it belonged to a litany . Then she tried to fancy her friends as they might be in prison and could not , could only see them before their fireplace on a winter day of the year before . She had come to tea and had stayed on for sherry . She sat on a maroon sofa ; a little dog slept with his chin on her arm , whimpering once in a dream . There was shortbreadto go with the wine and as she ate a piece she realized that it was the texture rather than the taste that made it her favorite pastry . In an easy silence that came in the conversation , she saw her reflection in the brass bedwarmer that hung beside the fireplace , and this blurred travesty of her face had the power , as the star had done this morning , to make her suddenly purposeful , and she told her friends good-by that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early desolation of this present year , she felt tenderness muffling her like smoke and smaller , general pictures showed themselves to her : a clean room , a forced sprig of bittersweet , her mother 's silver-backed hairbrush , her friends ' passport pictures . No time at all had passed . She saw the beggar 's lips part again . She could not find her voice , and one bold self chided her for her nervousness , for this was no extraordinary occurrence . On the contrary , the rarest day in New York was the one on which one was not asked for money by a fellow like this or by a senile tart or by a belligerent child . She could pass by , or she could say she had no money . But mechanically she had paused  --  she was not yet a craftsman in the selection of experience and her days were often a chain of pauses  --  and the man took advantage of her hesitance saying , with his vague face close to hers , " Lady , was you ever hungry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant anger , for his question was beside the point , unfair , a contemptible trick . She almost spoke her indignation aloud and then her anger burnt itself out ; she controlled herself stiffly like a soldier : on this grave day she should not presume to judge . And into the cold hand , she put the quarter and one of the dimes . The man muttered something but she did not hear what he said and she went on hastily . In the windows of a flower shop , she saw her shadow drift through pots of tall azaleas . When she turned the corner at Sixteenthp150Street , she slowed down , for two nuns walked slowly ahead of her . Her hunger returned with savage force . The entrance to the Jesuits ' church was dark . Its black iron gates were open only a crack . A night-like and velvetyblackness stood solidly between the columns on the porch of the upper church . The stone steps leading downwardseemed colder than the sidewalks , and the holy water was cold . It teemed with the ripples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the touch of it on her forehead was icy . Today , between the wounded feet , were dark roses . One of the sisters touched the feet and then pressed her fingers to her lips . The mass had not begun . The girl said her prayers , but she could not concentrate , for her mind was occupied with what she would do with her last dime . Who was the neediest , she questioned : the poor , the dead , or the oppressed ? Truly , she had to admit that she loved the poor less than her mother and her friends , and yet , for this very reason  --  for a willful sacrifice  --  should she not put the dime into the poor box ? Then she thought , but I have given already to the poor . Lout , wastrel that he was , he was poor and it is not the duty , nor even the right , of the almsgiver to distinguish betweendegrees of poverty . But between her mother and her friends , how should she choose ? Should one pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shortened term in Purgatory ? It occurred to her to offer her mass for her mother and light the candle for the prisoners.  |p151This  seemed like a compromise and did not satisfy her , yet there was no alternative . Four nuns were in the pew ahead of her and , finishingtheir prayers , they sat back and simultaneously opened their missals . On the right hand of one , she saw a wedding ring . She had never before been close enough to a nun to notice this , and she wondered when it was that the badge of their eternal marriage was placed upon them and if they really did feel unity with God at that moment or felt , instead , hushed isolation . The words of the Gospel today were : Lay up to yourselves treasures in heaven : where neither the rust nor the moth doth consume , and where thieves do not break through nor steal . For where thy treasure is , there is thy heart also . The words , now that she had seen the wedding ring , seemed richer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment she was almost idolatrous , worshipful , almost , of the fair-skinned sisters in their tower of ivory and their house of gold . And then she recoiled , for under the coif of one she saw black stubble . The church was full , principally of old people who slept so little that rising for the earliest mass on Ash Wednesday was no great hardship . Most of them were telling their beads and only a few had missals . An aged man behind her said his Aves aloud in a harsh , sibilant voice and his false teeth clicked on one another in a curious counterpoint to the measured whispers of his wooden beads . A bald young seminarian entered the sanctuary to light the candles on the altar . He genu/fleeted gracefully and liquidly like a dancer , and the hand with which he crossed himself was as long and white and shapely as one painted by El Greco . He was incongruously beautiful in his surroundings , for the lower church was ugly and in bad taste . The statues were gaudy , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In all the accouterments of the sanctuary , there was a mixture of modern leanness and Victorian laciness . The seminarian alone seemed a product of inspiration . At last the bell rang and the celebrant with his altar boys entered the sanctuary . The girl prayed that nothing would mar the spirit of penance which she carried like a fragile light within her ; she closed her eyes to the nun 's neck and begged forgiveness for her fault-finding . All through the mass , while she fixed her attention on her mother  --  imagining her face , disembodied , hoveringin a crowd of other faces in Purgatory which she saw as an echoing marble hall  --  she wondered if she had not committed an act of betrayal , both to the beggar to whom she gave unwillingly and to the parish poor , deprived of her offering through her cowardice . Althoughshe knew that her confusion would be understood and unraveled by the counsel of a confessor , she went , half dazed , to the communion rail and received , she felt , with an imperfect heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude : I humbly beseech guidance and my whole heart desires wisdom and stern purpose . Reason reiterated to her thatp153she had properly allocated her good will : money to the poor , a mass for the dead , a candle for the oppressed . Yet she was not assured in her heart and she prayed with a dry compulsion . When she had received the cross of ashes on her forehead , she went directly to the altar of St. Francis Xavier at the back of the church . The cups for the candles were blood-red ; the flames cast a sheen on the closed tabernacle . She knelt down to pray the saint to watch over her friends . As she stood up to take the taper to light her candle , she saw an old woman coming from the vestibule . She pretended not to see , for she recognized the old crone who was always there before the sun and the Jesuits discovered her . At later masses she begged on the sidewalk . The girl had already lighted the taper and was looking for a fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unctuous , crafty , she slithered to her knees . " God bless you , dearie , " she began , her face touching the skirt of the girl 's coat . The dime was in the pocket on that side , and it was as if the woman smelled it with her long nose or heard it with her ear beneath her sour gray hair or felt it on her furrowed cheek . It was impossible to ignore her , and the girl could think of no way to resolve this preposterous dilemma . Her hand still held the taper and her eyes still roved the tiers of candles seeking an unlighted one . It seemed some time before the old woman spoke again . Behind them , people were moving about , un-154 Jean Staffordconcerned with anything but the small devotional tasks they had set themselves . Some were making the stations of the cross , some prayed at the Lady altar , others gazed meditatively at the crucifix . The bald young beadle had come again into the sanctuary and was preparing the altar for the next mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , save for the squalid commerceat St. Francis ' altar . The ceiling seemed oppressivelylow ; she was reminded of a dreary trainshed . When the woman spoke again , her voice was more eager and hopeful . She nodded toward the candles and said , " They 're every one of them lit already and they wo n't bring the new ones round till after the eight o'clock . " How well she knew the habits of this church 's servants ! She had probably studied them for months , huddling in shadows behind the grating that enclosed the baptismal font or in the corner where the statue of St. Ignatius stood . The girl saw that what she said was true and she blew out the taper and replaced it . But she was determined to make the offering and she stepped down to go to another altar . The old woman took hold of her coat and peered straight into her face , shamelessly . She said , " You 're young and pretty , girlie . " The oblique entreaty weakened her , embarrassed her movementlike a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket and took out the dime . Before the clever , metropolitanfingers had enclosed the alms , the girl had gone , running down Sixteenth Street to the corner of Sixthp155Avenue . The streets were lighter now , and the big star had begun to pale . Shop-keepers were putting trash on the sidewalks ; news vendors were cutting the ropes that bound the morning papers ; a melancholy white horse ambled down the street dragging a milk truck after him . When the coffee was nearly ready and her rooms were full of its fragrance , the girl looked at her forehead in the bathroom mirror and saw that the Jesuit had marked her clearly . She washed away the ashes , leaving herself alone possessed of the knowledge of her penance.  |p157Every  morning and on alternate afternoons , Rose Fabrizio , a Mexican girl from the West , worked at a discreet girls ' boarding school as secretary to the headmistress , a Miss Talmadge who had a sweet voice . It was sweet even when she was dictating a warm comeuppance to the laundry about its mistreatment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was explaining the value of physical education to a recalcitrantpupil who declared that she loathed volleyball . Every day when she arrived shortly after Rose had unlockedthe office and uncovered her typewriter , Miss Talmadge cried " Good morning " twice and then she said with a lilt , " How is our Westerner ? Acclimated ? Findingthe charm of New England both within and without ? " She then stepped briskly into her own office and made a great clatter with the files , rudely flung up the window no matter what the thermometer said and set to work like a whirlwind . At first Rose , who was twentyoneand uncommonly sensitive , bridled at this greeting which she believed to be subtly derisive , but now after two months , she knew that there was no feeling behind it at all ; Miss Talmadge inquired , in the same sweetp158rapid way , quite indifferent to the answers , about the parlormaid 's fiance and the French teacher 's needlepointand the riding master 's brother 's greenhouse . But even now , this reminder of her origin ( vague as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she imagined anything at all , she probably imagined cigar-store Indians and clumps of sage ) sometimes brought on a subcutaneousprickle and distracted Rose from her shorthand so that on occasion she had fetched up with sentences that could not possibly he parsed . Except in the vocal presence of Miss Talmadge , she was acclimated and she did find New England charming , although she was not quite sure that she had found it so both within and without , having no idea what the headmistress meant . She rejoiced in the abundance of imposing trees , in the pure style of the houses and the churches , in the venerable graveyards and in the unobtrusiveshops . One was not conscious of any of the working parts of the town , not of the railroad nor of the filling stations nor of the water towers and the lightplants . Her own town , out West , had next to no trees and those were puny and half-bald . The main street there was a row of dirty doorways which led into the dirtier interiors of pool halls , drugstores where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and small restaurants and beer-parlors and hotels whose windows were decoratedsometimes with sweet-potato vines growing out of jam cans painted red , and sometimes with a prospector 's pick-ax and some spurious gold ore , and sometimes withp159nothing more than the concupiscent but pessimistic legend that ladies were invited or that there were booths for them . The people here in this dignified New Englandtown , shabby as they might be , wore hats and gloves at all hours and on all days and they appeared moral , self-controlled , well-bathed , and literate . The population of her own town was largely Mexican and was therefore , by turns , criminally quarrelsome or grossly stupefied so that when they were not beating one another up they stared into dusty space or lounged in various comatose attitudes against the stock propertiesof the main street : the telephone poles and fire hydrantsand hitching posts . They were swarthy and they tended , on the whole , to be fat and to wear bright , juvenilecolors . Repudiating all that , she greatly admired the pallor of the people here and their dun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he had gone to Harvard . In this atmosphere of good breeding and adulthood , Rose was happy half the time and altogether miserable the rest of it , miserable , that is , with envy of the people who had been born here of upright gentlefolk and had been reared in mannerly calm . And Rose , although she was full-grown and had a Bachelor of Arts degree ( to be sure she had not gone to Radcliffe and her education had been a shabby , uninteresting affair ) longed to be adopted by a New Englander . Sometimes this longing coupled with her loneliness  --  it was not to its detriment that the town was unfriendly but quite the contrary  --   |p160fretted  her so that she could neither read nor play Canfieldand she sat idle and unhappy in her bed-sitting room where the wind came down the chimney like a failingvoice and now and then caused the long-handled bedwarmer to stir on its hook , chiming against the bricks . She had selected the very person she wished to becomeher foster-father , a man about sixty whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town library , an incongruously modern building dedicated to the memory of Samuel Sewell . Here Rose read books on psychology in a western room where the sun came amply through the windows ; in this room , besidesherself , there always sat a thoughtful gentleman , wearing a lemon-yellow ascot and a sober dark blue suit . The ascot alone would have set him down as a person of prominence , for no one unimportant , she reasoned , could afford to be so boldly eccentric . She did not know what he read through the scholarly Oxford glasses which perfectly fitted on his stately nose and were anchored to his lapel by a black ribbon ending in a silver button . The books were big , she knew that much , and their bindingswere a usual maroon . He did not take any notes ( as she did voluminously , having been so recently graduated ) and he read quite slowly . He did not move all afternoon save that at half past three he went outside and stood on the steps to smoke a cigarette ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat reading of Pavlov 's submissive dog . Either he stood still , leaning against a half-pillar of the half-Ionicp161facade with his eyes closed and his lips moving a little , or he took a turn around the little triangular yard , holding his hatless white head at a dignified backward angle . Occasionally he paused under a tree and there , ankle deep in fallen leaves from the wine-glass elm , he was lost impressively in speculation . She thought he might be a mathematician or a novelist . Often when he returned , bringing with him a final remnant of the autumn air , he looked over at Rose across the tables and gave her an amiable , perfunctory nod as if he were her busy employer passing through the office of his underlings . Once he said something to her but in so low a voice and with so noncommittal an expression on his face that she did not understand and only smiled . Despite a heritage of headlong impulse and her practice of setting forth before the signal was given , Rose made no move to further her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains never to see him out of his context . She always left the library before he did so that she would neither be tempted to find out what he was reading , since this would give a clue to his profession , nor to discover the direction he took to go home . Earlier in the fall , before she was aware that her library habits coincided with his and before she wanted to be adopted by him , she had enjoyed walking through the woods and over the hills and beside the river . On Sundays she had always gone to the largest and the oldestcemetery and there , upon a crest of rocks which overlookedthe thin , ungarnished headstones , she had thor/oughly read the literary supplement of the New York Times and had absently considered the hedge of barberrythat flourished every which way beside a brook : . She had liked to in them and were about to order tea . But now on Sunday , she stayed in her room , long as the day seemed , for it would in no way serve her purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library-man if he should come some time to pay his respects to someone 's bones , those of his wife , perhaps , or a beloved daughter dead in early womanhood . And before this , she had gone to dinner once or twice a week to an inn a mile out of the town on a byroad . This inn had the mark of Henry Ford upon it and so had the diners who disputed facts involved in the AmericanRevolution and who exclaimed over the hastypudding . The landlord , a lethargic man from Bangor , sat in a chimney corner smoking an authentic pipe and the cook was said to be descended from King Philip on the maternal side . Rose did not think it probable that the man in the yellow ascot would ever come to a place like this since the atmosphere of his own dining room would be , if anything , even more bona fide . But she did not wish to run any risk , for , just as she did not want to know what books he read ( he might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did not want to see him laying flowers upon his daughter 's grave ( for it might not be a daughter at all but only some old auntp163by marriage ) so she did not want to see him eating lest she discover that he followed an idiosyncratic diet and therefore had a constitutional disease . AR this abstention and the restiveness that accompaniedit made her days and evenings monotonous and she became very much aware of the drawbacks of her room which until now she had found  --  at least by comparison with the room at home which she shared with two younger sisters both of whom walked in their sleep and one of whom gnashed her teeth  --  ideal . She lived on the ground floor of a double house that stood on a cornerand was shaped like a wedge so that the front doors were on different streets . Her room , at Number 8 PatriotRoad , was flush with what she thought must be the parlor at Number 6 Faneuil Lane and through the wood and plaster she sometimes heard throttled voices , heavy footsteps , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a sound in Number 8 . She was the only lodger on the first floor , but upstairs there were several meek and apparitional figures whom she met in the mildewed hall as she went to and from the bathroom . The landlady lived across the entry-way from Rose and was visible only on Wednesday evening when she came to collect the rent and present the clean towels . Generallythis transaction was performed as a dumb show and without smiles . The telephone seldom rang and the doorbellnever . Besides this rather sepulchral air , the house was chilly and the lamps in Rose 's room were poor . Her feeling toward the silence of Number 8 and thep164sounds , low and distorted as they were , of Number 6 , passed through several stages between the middle of October and the Thanksgiving holiday . At first the quiet of her own house pleased her because she could read with such concentration and the noises of 6 irritated her when they were loud enough to intrude upon her page , yet not quite loud enough to be properly identified . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence and felt that it was unnatural , while she was grateful for the indications through the wall that there was life just yonder . And , again , she would be strained and unsettled , waiting for the noises and unable to make use of the interstices of silence between them . She never saw the tenants of the other house , but she had an idea what sort they might be , for frequently there was an electric car in front , looking like a large , abandoned toy . The driver of it , she was certain , would be a brisk old lady with no nonsense about her and she came to believe , groundlessly , that there were two such old ladies , sisters , perhaps , or friends since boarding school days at Lausanne . One must be either rather fat or else somewhat lame and wear special shoes , for nothing else could account for the heavy tread Rose sometimes heard . Once , on a Sunday afternoon , out of a clear blue sky she wondered if the man in the yellow ascot ever called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peculiarly awful possibility that he might be there at this very moment . On Thanksgiving Day , she went to the inn outside thep165town for midday dinner . The library-man was there and the moment she saw him , dressed as usual , she knew that she had secretly expected him , for she was not at all surprised . He was sitting at a table near the fireplace engaged in conversation with the landlord and simultaneouslyreading the menu . A bright fire burned in the hearth and his fresh skin shone in the light like a leaf turned golden and it appeared to have a leaf 's smooth texture . He sat very straight in his chair and while he waited for the soup , he closed his eyes and calmly smiled as he listened to the landlord who was apparently tellinga long joke . He looked as if he might be sitting for his portrait and , indeed , he would have been a distinguishedsubject for a painter who did accurate " likenesses " of college presidents and notable physicians , for his face had admirable qualities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was in no hurry . He waited for his dinner with his eyes closed , not having to be occupied with looking round the room at the other diners and at the Currier and Ives prints on the walls and all the antique furniturewhich one might buy if one were able . Rose 's own young and impatient mind immediately pranced away from him and dwelt , in quick succession , upon the brindlecat who was balancing for no earthly reason on the newel post ; upon the lemon tree in the bay window , fed like an animal to produce fruit of a dreadful size ; two quiet brown-eyed children who sat silent at a table with two thin old women , holding their hands between coursesp166in an attitude of prayer . Fleetly it struck her that these two might be her neighbors and at that very moment , as if she had been directed by a voice , she looked out the window at the far driveway and saw the electric car , its square top grizzled with frost . It must be that the children were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be a doubtful pleasure to them all since the four mute mouths bore an illegible expression . Rose did not look at her foster-father save when her eyes fell on him by accident . Once she caught him looking at her over a piled fork and in his surprise , he let some of the stuffing fall off . Every inch of her skin felt roasted and her hands shook so that for a moment she dared not try to lift her water glass although her mouth was dry . And later when his salad came , she looked again and he distinctly winked at her as he tossed the cloves of tomato and the water cress . It was not a plainspokenwink at all and it made her nervous . She hurried through her meal in order that she might leave before he did because , besides the ambiguous gambit of his eye , she was inadmissibly afraid that he , not the old ladies , might enter the electric car . She grappled hard with her suspicions about him and imperatively pointed out to herself that this stately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally given his housekeeper and his cook the day off and because the air was fine and sharp , had liked to walk a mile to his dinner . She could not help feeling that it was strange he had notp167been invited anywhere , for surely a man of his position , whatever it was , would have friends in the town . Perhapshe despised the sentimental fanfare of holidays . Next year , after his adoption of her was a legal fact , she imagined that on Thanksgiving , Christmas , and Easter they would dine alone and afterward would play backgammon . Yet already she was visited with a nettlesome problem : should she play badly so that he would have the pleasure of winning or cleverly so that he would praise her ? She rather hoped that he did not have a violin or any whimsical hobbies like collecting Revolutionaryartifacts or going for bird-walks . Rose did not wait for her dessert and on her way out she glanced quickly at the coats hung on the pegs in the hall . She recognized his immediately ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn , it still was very rich and serviceable . His derby was there too and a tartan muffler . Fearing the road along which , at any moment , the electric car might pass , she struck into the woods and walked home along the pale , thick river . She found a nickel and a fresh-water mussel shell and she came upon a beached canoe , withering in the dry fall . She passed behind the girls ' school and glanced at the windows of the dormitory with their starched dimity curtains . The little girls had all gone home to their fathers for the holiday . She was very lonely here beside the river and she began to walk fast , counting her footsteps to forestall her melancholy , but then she slowed down again as she realized that she would bep168just as lonely in her room . Until now she had been content with seeing the man in the library and had even been a little proud in a queer way that he had a life quite secret , quite independent of the alternate afternoonsin the reading room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimaginable to him . But now beside the woeful river , she was almost frightened to think of him just as she had almost been frightened as a child when everyone had left the church after the last mass and she had wondered what happened then , whether the plaster saints came to life and if God emerged , full-bodied , from the wafers in the ciborium . Rose did not know , until she was actually within her room again , shadowy with dusk and musty with the old upholstery of the buckling wicker chairs , that there had been another reason why she had not liked to come back : now she was face to face with the knowledge that she had seen the driver of the electric car who was , therefore , one of the authors of the noises in the other house . The car had got there before she did . The very moment she stepped across her threshold onto the distempered carpet with its muddy oak leaves , the sounds came , feebly ill-natured , straight to her anticipating ears . There were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , while she was thinking of the man as he sat in his own library ( the Samuel Sewell was closed today ) in one of the white clapboard houses in the side streets of the town , the dulled hubbub went on beyond the wall . At first she paid little heed ; she wasp169thinking of the chintz wing chair he might be sitting in with his feet on a brass fender before a fire . And at first the sounds were unobtrusive . But toward dark , they becamemore insistent and she grew fully conscious of them . Although she could not hear words nor could she tell what sort of movements were being made , she was entirely alert , straining to read this trifling mystery . After a little , she was able to separate some of the noises and she heard a door open and close and a telephone ring and a clock strike and outside , in the street , she heard a boy irrelevantly cry , " Richard ? " and she heard something bump over an uncarpeted floor . But above  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jerky hum  --  the other sounds , there was a voice complaining , directly on the other side of the wall ; it was a venomous and senile whimper which went on and on . It seemed to be uttering short curses with just time for a breath in between the tenth , perhaps , and the eleventh . Presentlythere was another opening and closing of the door and a second voice , a man 's voice , spoke . There was , as well , a rattle of metal and now Rose constructed a picture : someone was ill and someone else was bringing a tray to the sick-bed . But the important fact was that she must revise her general notion of the household : it included a man . Yet why could it not be a doctor , summonedhastily because one of the old ladies had eaten unwisely at the inn ? She regretted that she had not scrutinized her neighbors more closely to see if they bore any marks of frailty in the color of the skin or thep170look about the nose . She sighed and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown dark , and once again the electric car served her , for here it came , a silent , absurd box , round the corner and on its way toward the Mill Dam . " They have gone for the prescription , " she said happily , and she saw a peaked spinster lying in a bed , another peaked one operating the simple machinery of the car . And she assured herself that the driver must , indeed must , he one of the children 's greatauntsfor no man in his right mind would be seen in such a thing in this day and age . When she had pulled the bottle-green blinds and turned on her two lamps , no brighter than candle flames , she was momentarily disgusted with herself for spendingso much time conjecturing on unseen and unknown people . She was as bad as her mother who could search a whole evening through for the inner meanings of a neighbor 's greeting when they had not been on speaking terms for weeks or the impertinence of a salesgirl in the five and ten . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to the man in the yellow ascot but he was suddenly gone altogether and instead of him she could only see her real father , Joseph Fabrizio , who would be having a holiday today like everyone else and who , stupid and cynical , would be shambling about the house out West where even the hopvines at the windows were limp and unclean . Her father wore a black coatsweaterfrom J. C. Penney 's and a spotty gray cap and Army store pants and miner 's shoes studded with cleats that tore up the linoleum and made a brash racket . Thep171putrefied smell of sugar beets clung to him constantly even after a bath which he took only once in a month of Sundays . She did not know one good thing about her father except that when she was very small she had been delighted to hear him sing " Juanita " and " Valencia " in a tenor voice for which he was admired by two or three people in the town ; and one time when he must have been as drunk as a monkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy of Sweetheart Stories when she had the pinkeye . Although as far back as she could remember , she had been driven to get away , far away and never go home again , she was often resentful that he never wrote to her and that he had not been at all sorry when she had gone away . As a matter of fact , he had not even seen her off on the bus and her mother did not know where he was . Her mother said , looking vaguely up and down the street and nodding to several acquaintances , " Well , I 'll tell him good-by for you , " and handed her a lunch in a Honey Kist bread wrapper . The simple and humiliating fact was that he cared so little that he had clean forgotten . The memories of her father , each one of which was uglier than the one before , made her so cross and jumpy that she knew she must quiet herself and she sat down to read Self Reliance which she had always found very soothing because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it even less than usual and the pattern of sounds next door presently was repeated : the telephone , the opening and closing of the door , the sound of china and silver on a tray . She was irritated and whenp172she returned to Emerson , exhorting him to lull her , the voice would give her no peace but went on in its protractedpeeve , hovering like a gnat over every word on the page . Finally she grew really angry and she knocked sharply on the wall . There was an immediate silence and then a most terrible and much louder sound : it was a laugh ! And such a laugh as she had never heard in her life for it was as thin as a needle and unlike the speech , it did not quaver . For a moment she was afraid and she stepped away as if there were real danger , and then she was even angrier than before and her thoughts went quickly down this ladder of unreason , " If my father had not been a low person and if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty and I would not have hated him so much that I had to go away from home to the first job that came along , this mean one that pays so little that I must live in a dark , depressing room where the walls are so thin that the sound of sicknesscomes through and for no reason at all I am laughed at by a cruel person who does not even know me . " And she envisaged her father as he had probably been that day she had boarded the orange bus ; fat and foultonguedhe would have been shooting Cowboy at the pool hall where they had spittoons since most of the patrons , including ( God damn him ) her father , chewed tobacco . It was no longer possible for Rose to stay in her room in the evenings because of the busy personalities so near ,  |p173and  after dinner she went back to the Samuel Sewell . The overhead light was poor and made her eyes smart and she missed not sitting in her wrapper and her slippers . She was impatient with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was not taken to the hospital . Sometimes they went on for years that way , just clinging to the ragged edge of nothing , getting more and more querulous and bothersome . Miss Talmadge noticed that Rose was distraught and when she asked and Rose said that she was dissatisfied with her room , Miss Talmadge objected with vehement sweetness , " But it is a quaint room ! It is a lovely , lovely , lovely room ! " and began instantly to dictate a stunning letter to the parent of a pupil who , in a tantrum over nothing at all , had deliberately broken a hockey stick belonging to the school . One morning just before the Christmas holiday , Miss Talmadge asked , in her pink voice , if Rose would run an errand for her in the afternoon . The girls of the fourth form wished to send a potted plant to someone who was ill , a former matron . Rose was not surprised at all when she heard that the address was Number 6 Fanueil Lane . So important was this illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that there was anotherinvalid in the town and Miss Talmadge , never dreaming that the retired matron was the reason she did not like her room , said , with pointless cheer , " It will be so handy for you . " She accepted the commission with the greatest re/luctance , not only because she wanted the occupants of the other house to remain anonymous but because , as well , she had a horror of being near old people and she remembered a time when the fifth grade had gone to sing Christmas carols at the old people 's home . There had been a smell of senility in the long room with its glaring linoleum and Mission benches where the old people sat fiddling with their neckties or with pieces of holly purloined from the dining room decorations . The last song was " We Three Kings " and by this time Rose was so sick that she only moved her lips , not making any sound . When it was over and they stood for a moment , dumb and immobile , until the teacher came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man rose to his feet and cried , " Damned brats ! Clear them damned brats out p.d.q . " He had bicycle clips on his eleemosynaryplus-fours . She had never actually passed the other house and she was surprised to find that its facade was altogether different from that of Number 8 Patriot Road . The paint was a darker shade of red and instead of two bay windowsit had only one , just to the right of the off-center door . In the windows at Number 8 , the landlady kept ferns and cactuses but there was nothing at all alive in those of Number 6 and there were no curtains . There was only a solitary tuberculosis seal from the year before pasted in the lowest middle pane . Instead of a neat brass letter-slot , there was a raveling raffia basket which hung on a hammock-hookto hold the mail and there was no knockerp175but a bell instead , the kind you rang by turning an embossediron handle . She turned it and heard a tinkle and instantly a voice very near her cried thinly , " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from but she waited in discomfort , feeling that she was being looked at from some vantage point no more than a foot away . Still , no one came . It was snowing and the big soft flakes dissolved in beautiful splashes on the glazed green paper that wrapped the bleeding-heart . She rang again , and again , immediately , the voice encouragingly said , " Just a minute ! " It was a high and genderless voice and was , she thought , the same one that had laughed at her when she had knocked on the wall . She was despondent here in the twilight snowstorm and her fingers clutching the pot were growing numb . The voice broke its promise for the second time ; several minutes passed and nothing happened . She would try once more and if still no one came , she would leave the plant on the doorstep even though it might freeze . Each moment she hated her role more , no matter what its outcome was to be . It would be worse than ever now to hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the interior of the house ( how dreadful if she had to go into the sickroom itself ! ) and it would be almost as bad if the door was never opened and whoever it was that bade her wait a minute saw her leave and enter Number 8 . Her comings and goings would thereafter be observed ; or , even if they were n't , she would think they were andp176now , besides the sounds , she would be rattled by hypotheticaleyes spying upon her . She was about to ring for the last time when out of the corner of her eye , she saw the electric car coming cautiously down the gentle slope of the street . Now there was no escaping . The great-aunt driving the car and the bodiless procrastinator behind the door would catch her there with the bleeding-heart and make her explain herself . " Just a minute ! " The voice , speaking this time of its own accord and not in answer to the bell , startled her and the plant slipped in her hands . The car disappeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distant door opened and closed and Rose firmly rang the bell . This time the voice laughed mockingly up and down an untrue scale and she was in no doubt at all that it was the same one that had sneered at her knock . The mysterious house behind the black door was seized with spasms . Someone screamed , " Tea ! " and a stove was madly shaken down . Heavy footsteps crossed a room and a man 's voice , roared , " What ? What do you say ? " " Tea ! Toast ! " the screamed reply rang clear and the " s " in the toast was prolonged with hatred . " Give a person a chance to turn around , Mother ! " said the man and the laughing voice near Rose chuckled high in its throat and mimicked itself , " Just a minute ! " and then mimicked the deep voice of the man , " Just a minute ! " She would have set the present down and run for dearp177life , but she was too late , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet approached the door . " Well ! " said the man in the yellow ascot with the same comforting smile he gave her in the library when he came in from smoking . He held the door wide open so that she saw a tall spooky staircase and a room to the right where chairs were arranged in a circle as if for a funeral or a clergyman 's tea . Rose took a step forward and held out the bleeding-heart to him , unable to say a word . " Well ! " he said again . " What 's this ? A posy for my poor sick mother ? " He , for his part , was not in the least discomfited by this meeting . It was clear that he recognizedher but he was not surprised ; it was almost as if he had expected her all along . Now that she was up close , she saw that the ascot was made of diapered foulard but she saw , as well , that it was not clean and had the uncleanliness that accumulates over a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a goiter or a birthmark or if it were some sort of fascist insignia and he was cat's-paw to a band of crooks . " Yes , " she said , as bashful as a child . " It is a plant from the school . " From the left came the scream again , beside itself with rage , " Tea ! Toast ! Me ! " The man , as if to himself , said , " Bring my tea and toast to me , " and then smiling and looking directly at Rose with active brown eyes , he explained , " My mother has lost her verbs and adjectives . In fact , she has lost all parts of speech ex/cept her nouns and pronouns , a very interesting phenomenon . Come in , please , " and he put his hand under her elbow with gallant pressure . There was nothing she could do and she stepped inside the vestibule which had a sweet smell like the taste of Neccos . " Where shall I put it ? " Rose asked . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you think ? What kind is it ? A geranium , I hope . " " A bleeding-heart . " " Oh , " he said scowling . " Well , we 'll have to make the best of it . " He tucked her arm in his and bent down toward her . " She likes either geraniums or cut flowers . She has forgotten the names of all the others . " Now that she was so close to him she discovered that it was he who smelled of Neccos and that actually the hall smelled of ordure . There was a rustling like that of stiff silk and the man said , " Excuse me just a minute , " and right beside them but still invisible the voice malevolently aped him . He shut the door and there she saw a parrot in a cage on a marble-topped bureau . It regarded her with wicked eyes like a patient maniac . " I 'll bet Waldo here had you buffaloed , did n't he ? " said the man with a laugh as he opened the cage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a haughty mutter . " He 's a great old bird . " " Hours ! " shrieked the voice of the invalid and the man translated for the smug bird , " You have been gone for hours . " Rose , while she could not claim to be really surprisedp179herself , could not adjust herself to the man 's unhesitatingacceptance of the situation as if they had planned it together some days before . He indicated that she was to precede him down the corridor as if this were the most natural thing in the world , and they went , all three of them , down the slightly veering hall where ghostly pictures hung and on the way the man said , like a guide , " As you see , we live very simply , Mother and I. The room to your right is the parlor which we seldom use in winter . Perhaps you observed the portrait on the far wall of that room ? An illustrious ancestor . Upstairs there are four bedrooms besides yours truly 's . Linen closet , of course , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he said , secretly as if the parrot were eavesdropping , " I have seen you in the library , you know , Rose . " He said her name in a way that the greenestschoolgirl could not have misconstrued and she trembled from head to foot and had to grasp the plant tightly or it would have fallen . His breathing was a little heavy and the parrot , eying Rose in the twilight of the hall , gave forth a glottal giggle full of wisdom . All the low furniture in the invalid woman 's room was painted white except for the narrow bed which was blackish-brown and looked like a catafalque . The bones of the flagging body on it jutted up under a royal purplecounterpane . At first only the head and shoulders of the ancient woman showed , but when the small red eyes , witlessly mean with age , saw the parrot , she drew forthp180a huge piebald hand and her tongue labored on her lip as she said , " Him me . " " Quite like a child , " said her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on her wrist . " The young lady here , Miss Rose , has brought you a plant , Mother . She says it 's from the school . " The old woman 's fingernails were painted a morbid red and one of the fingers stroked the parrot 's stout yellowtalons . Although the woman did not look at her , she said , " Roses . Gratitude . " " No , Mother , not roses . I said this young lady 's name was Miss Rose . She has brought a bleeding-heart . " He added in an exasperated aside , " Not that it matters a hoot in hell what kind of any old thing it is . " The invalid covered Rose with an ambiguous glance and said , " I her . " " I her , " repeated her son . " I do n't know what she means . " He began to take the paper off the plant and growled , " I surely hope she likes it . She surely should . Very thoughtful of the school to my way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old woman in a louder voice and the man flushed . Obviously this could signify anything : " I hate her , " " I want her to go , " or " I have never seen her before . " It was a cul-de-sac that could not very well be ignored because she said it over and over and presently Waldo joined with his one sentence and they chanted antiphonally , " I her , " " Just a minute , " " I her , " " Just a minute . " While these two obscene creatures on the bed were making a spectacle of themselves , the manp181was clumsily trying to get the string off the flower-pot and nudging Rose every now and again although he did not need to . There was an awful odor in the room , both medicinal and decayed , and everything looked soiled and moist . The shape of the room and the situation of the furniture were the same as in Rose 's room as if in a planned parody . The man got the knot untied and slipped the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silence , " and to her son , " I her bell . " " Of course ! " cried the man with relief . " I heard her ring the bell ? " And the woman nodded her head up and down with a delighted smile on the thin crescent of her mouth . He put the bleeding-heart on the low white table beside the bed where a Bible lay , conventional and new , and some sticky bottles of medicine and some revolting gobbets of cotton . The other old hand with veins as thick as pencils came staggering out of the bed to pluck a blossom from the plant which it held out for the parrot . The fingernails were the same color as the little flower which disappeared in Waldo 's greedy bill . " Roses . Waldo . " " Yes , Mother , " said the man soothingly , " Roses for Waldo . " On the wall over the bed hung a sampler thatsaid , " LOOK UPWARD NOT DOWN . " Rose finally found her voice and she said urgently , " I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft pat on her arm . " But you have n't had your tea . You mustp182have tea with Mother . " Mother was plucking the flowers and feeding them to Waldo very rapidly for one of her years and debility . After each gobble , Waldo ducked his head with villainous coquetry . " I 'm sorry , " said Rose , " but I really must go . " He was looking with some consternation at his mother . " I say , you do n't think a bleeding-heart is toxic , do you ? I would n't like anything to happen to Waldo . " " I do n't know , " she said miserably , and to the woman on the bed she said , " Good-by . I am glad to have met you , " although this was a double lie for she was not glad and there had been no proper meeting . " Oh , you must have tea ! " cried the man and he fingeredhis yellow ascot nervously as if he could not bear to have her leave . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have such a pretty guest . " She shivered and buttonedthe top button of her coat . " It will only take a minute , " he wheedled . " It 's on the tray and I just plug in the electric kettle thing and we 're all set . " He gave himself a private smile and said , " All set and rarin ' to go . " She was about to be very firm and cutting if necessary to this tiresome old child by whom she had been so foolishly taken in at the library , but she thought of Miss Talmadge and was afraid if she were discourteous there might be trouble . It could not last long and he could not do anything improper to her in front of his mother and the parrot whose sagacious gaze missed nothing . So she gave in and he drew a rocking chair to the center ofp183the room and beside it he put a bench . " The tray goes here , " he said , " and you can pour . " And then he left the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ten minutes he was gone were for Rose a bizarre and separate experience . The old woman and the parrot clucked at one another over the sinister meal of bleedingheartsand but for this there was silence in the darkeningroom . She was forced to accept the reality of the afternoon , that the man in the yellow ascot lived here and that he drove the electric car and that in no particulardid he resemble her image of her foster-father . And it was quite possible to accept it now , but she was apprehensiveof the evening to come and the next afternoon when she would meet him again in the Samuel Sewell . There were only two flowers left on the plant and for some reason she hoped that tea would be here before they were gone . She glanced toward the bed ; the headboardwas just opposite her desk and she knew that she could never again write there with the picture in her mind of the old woman feeding the evil bird . A good deal in her quiet life would be changed . She doubted if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customaryafternoons , for example . She would be free , it is true , to walk once again in the parts of the town and the country she had enjoyed before but this gain was offset by the knowledge that there was no mystery left : she knew exactly where the man lived and , moreover , to her regret , she knew how he lived.  |p184The  next to the last blossom was gone and then the last was gone and the feeding hand retired under the covers . The old woman looked at Waldo and at Rose and said , " You him . " She pretended neither to hear nor to see but stared at the sampler which had a border of pine-cones . A foot surreptitiously moved under the counterpaneand Waldo walked off his mistress ' hand so that Rose , nauseated , saw that he had not eaten the bleedingheartsat all , but had only mauled them and then had dropped them onto the bed where they lay in a heap like bloody matter . The command was repeated but she heard her host coming back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said , " I think your mother wanted me to take the parrot . " " Oh , did she ? " he asked with interest . " That shows she likes you . Yes , sir , that shows you 've made a big hit with Mother . " " But I do n't like birds , " she said . " Really ? How extraordinary ! I had a very charming Brazilian oriole to whom I was much attached . Waldo killed her , I never was just sure how . " On the tray were a plate of English muffins and a jar of peanut butter and one of marmalade and a storeboughtpound cake and a dish of pickled peaches . There were a can of evaporated milk and a tin of bouillon cubes . This last he picked up , mouthing the words , " This is what she thinks is tea . Is n't allowed tea . A stimulant . " Waldo laughed . It took a long time to prepare the meal . A good dealp185of furniture had to be moved before the kettle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the kitchen for spoons which he had forgotten and then for some plates for the pickled peaches . Then he stopped everything when he saw the mess Waldo had made with the flowers and for a moment Rose thought he was going to lose his temper . " Pest ! " he said sharply and gave Waldo a balefullook . When everything was ready , the old woman said " Radio " so the lamp had to be unplugged and the radio plugged in and candles had to be lit . The kettle made the radio splutter and creak and Waldo , the everlastingMr . Fixit , stared at the box and said patiently , " Just a minute . " But at last everything was ready and Rose began to pour the tea while the man spread peanut butter on the English muffins . The old woman sucked the bouillon and gave a sip to Waldo now and then . " I wish she would n't do that , " said the man , preoccupied with the muffins . " It gives him an intestinal con-dition . " Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Forty-eight , " he said . " Quite a character . He used to say some other things . I think you 're rather foolish , ' was one and Go by-by , Aunt Louisa ' was another , but he 's lost everything but Just a minute . ' " " It is remarkable , " said Rose , referring to the habit in this household of mislaying language . " Yes , " he mused , giving her a muffin in his hand . " Yes , Waldo 's quite a character . He keeps Mother coin/pany . If it were n't for Waldo , I 'd never get to have my little afternoons off at the library . " Because there was something in his voice that was not altogether trustworthy , she said , " What does he eat ? " " A special food for parrots , " he said . " Called Polly 's Perfect Preparation . ' But he likes fruit too . The trouble with fruit , though , is that it gives him that intestinal conditionI alluded to . " Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Time toast . " " Right you are , Mother . Time for toast , " and handed her a muffin with marmalade . Returning , he said sotto voce , " Time for toast and tea for two , what ? Do you often eat at the inn ? " " Oh , no , almost never . Do you ? " " No . Thanksgiving , Christmas , Easter , Patriots ' Day , that 's all . Not that the cuisine is not to my liking . But I am rather tied here to my poor sick mother . That is to say , I generally dine en famille . " A note of woe came into his voice : " En famille with Waldo . " She could not think of any comment to make on this very sad state of affairs and so she said , " What delicious peanut butter . " In point of fact , it was dry and tasteless and the muffin was cold and rubbery . As for the tea , it could not be described . She promised herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole cup of tea and then she would go even if it meant being rude . " Is it delicious peanut butter ? Oh , thank you , " hep187said joyfully and from the bed the old woman clamored , " Gratitude ! " The man asked her how she liked Miss Talmadge and if she were ever homesick for the West and if she did not find her room at Number 8 rather chilly when the wind came off the river . He said he imagined she found the fare at the Minute Man cafe pretty much the same old thing from day to day ; swordfish , canned peas , boiled potatoes . It was a little cold for sitting in the cemetery on Sunday afternoon nowadays , was n't it ? " Lonesome , are n't you , little lady ? " he said and Waldo warned from the footboard of the bed , " Just a minute . " She drank the last of the sour tea and returned the cup to the tray . She drew on her gloves and stood up . " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it was most kind of you . " The old woman beckoned to her and said , " Time . " " Yes , I know . It 's time for me to go . " She tried to smile warmly . " No , no , " cried her son anxiously , " she means there 's plenty of time . " But Rose would not be detained any longer and she moved toward the door . He was immediately beside her , following her down the hall as long and as dark as a tunnel . Halfway down Waldo came bustling after them and walked between them , laughing busily . The man held Rose 's elbow tightly as if by the pressure of his fingers he could communicate the desperate state of hisp188loneliness . " You ca n't imagine how awful it is , " he confidedurgently . " Today you only saw her company manners , but you should hear the things she says to me when we 're alone . " His voice was full of tears . " Rose ! Rose , we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , Rose . Wo n't you come again ? " " I 'll try , " she said without any pity at all . " When ? " " I do n't know . " " Tomorrow ? Oh , no , tomorrow we meet in the library , do n't we ? What do you read there ? " She was remote and academic . " I am doing some researchwork . " " That 's wonderful . I knew you were cultured . I went to Harvard . I dare say you 've heard of that little old college down Cambridge way ? " He was such a terrible mixture of unattractive qualitiesthat she did not know how his face managed to be so aristocratically handsome . They were at the door now and she put her hand out toward the knob , but he was ahead of her . " Permit me , Rose , " he said . " Please greet Miss Talmadge for my mother and me , but do n't tell her what happened to the bleeding-heart . " He grasped her hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her eyes , he whispered , " The Samuel Sewell tomorrow . " She ran down the steps and he called after her , " Rose ! My name is Mr. Benson ! " She heard him close the door and at the corner shep189paused in the snowfall , senseless with misery . She could not sleep another night in that room but she had nowhere to go . Tears for her homeless self went down her cheeks with the snowflakes and she let a little sound escape her , the murmur of an unhappy child . And then , because there was nothing else to do , she opened the front door of Number 8 and went into her room . She turned the radio on very loud and got a program of jazz played on an organ and deafened to any other possiblesound , she began to play solitaire , violently slappingthe cards down on the table . In this futile tantrum with the cards , she bent a corner of the Queen of Hearts and this reminded her of her father 's custom of spendingwhole winter evenings cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he used , as well , to slice off a plug of chewing tobacco , to trim his fingernails and , in the spring , to dig embedded woodticks out of his skin . When she came back from her dinner of swordfish at the Minute Man , she found a note on the rug just inside the door which said : My dear Rose , If you would care to go to the picture show tonight in Acton , I am at your disposal and wish you would telephone me . My name is in the book . I could come to your door or you could come to mine . Mrs. Morton Ripley is coming to call on Mother . I do not know when another opportunity will offer so hope you will not refuse . Awaiting your communication via telephone , I am , Lucius Bensonp190There was no sound from the room beyond the wall but the silence was an uneasy one and she shuddered thinking of what might be going on in there . Waldo and his mistress were capable of any sort of monstrous tableau if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She thought of going to the priest to ask for his advice or to the policeman for his protection . In any case , she could not stay here and after a minute of debate she let herself out quietly and went down the street and into the Mill Dam on her way to the library . But she had only just got to the triangular square of lawn in front of it when the electric car eased up alongside her and Mr. Benson leaned across and opened the door . " Here , here , " he gaily cried . " This is no way to treat your Dutch uncle . Climb in ! Hop right in , Rosie O'Grady , and off we 'll go to the picture show . " " Mr. Benson , " she began , giving his derby a hard look , " I ca n't go to the movies with you tonight . " " Nonsense , " he said . " Stuff and nonsense . Hop in , dear , we 'll be in time for the newsreel . Good gracious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to say that you 're afraid of a harmless old codger , old enough to be your father ? " " No , Mr. Benson , " she said , " I 'm not afraid of you . " And it was true , she was not afraid , she was only displeased . " But I wo n't go to the movies . " " Just think of me as your father , " he said . " Why do n't you call me that as a matter of fact ? I mean , notp191Father ' but one of the more familiar things like Daddy ' ? " It was not at all likely , she thought , that this was taking place . It was much too improbable that she was talkingunder an arc lamp in a snowfall to an elderly roue in an electric car who had invited her to call him Daddy . " If you wo n't come with me , " he said rather testily , " then I will come into the library and read . " She was at the end of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his age , no longer polite for Miss Talmadge 's sake , she burst out , " Oh , go to grass , " and she scuffled up the snowy path . " Let me tell you about my Brazilian oriole , " he called desperately through the quiet storm . " Waldo killed it out of pure spite ! I preferred it to Waldo and Waldo killed it out of spite ! " Rose went on up the path . " Rose ! " She heard him come running after her but she was not afraid , for the library was brightly lighted . She stopped when he was abreast of her and stamped her foot . " Go away , Mr. Benson , " she said . His head fell forward dejectedly and his beaver-lined coat which was not buttoned hung loosely on him as if he had suddenly shriveled . He was a die-hard . " Oh , Rose , " he said , " I assure you I mean no harm . " He touched the yellow ascot with the palm of his hand and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I amp192asking is a little pity . " He began to undo the scarf as she mounted the steps . When she was within the storm doors , she looked back and saw him standing there in the snow with his neck bare and his arms spread out , his palms upward in supplication . He had flung his head back and his derby had fallen to the ground ; he wore the yellow ascot on his left arm like a maniple . Just behind him , the electric car cast an absolutely square shadow on the white ground.  |p195Pansy  Vanneman , injured in an automobile accident , often woke up before dawn when the night noises of the hospital still came , in hushed hurry , through her halfopendoor . By day , when the nurses talked audibly with the interns , laughed without inhibition , and took no pains to soften their footsteps on the resounding compositionfloors , the routine of the hospital seemed as bland and commonplace as that of a bank or a factory . But in the dark hours , the whispering and the quickly stilled clatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wearing off , the soft squeak of a stretcher as it rolled past in its way from the emergencyward  --  these suggested agony and death . Thus , on the first morning , Pansy had faltered to consciousnesslong before daylight and had found herself in a ward from every bed of which , it seemed to her , came the bewildered protest of someone about to die . A caged light burned on the floor beside the bed next to hers . Her neighbor was dying and a priest was administering Extreme Unction . He was stout and elderly and he sufferedfrom asthma so that the struggle of his breathing , so close to her , was the basic pattern and all the otherp196sounds were superimposed upon it . Two middle-aged men in overcoats knelt on the floor beside the high bed . In a foreign tongue , the half-gone woman babbled against the hissing and sighing of the Latin prayers . She played with her rosary as if it were a toy : she tried , and failed , to put it into her mouth . Pansy felt horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so later , when the white ceiling lights were turned on and everything  --  faces , counterpanes , and the hands that groped upon them  --  was transformed into a uniform gray sordor , the woman was wheeled away in her bed to die somewhere else , in privacy . Pansy did not quite take this in , although she stared for a long time at the new , empty bed that had replaced the other . The next morning , when she again woke up before the light , this time in a private room , she recalled the woman with such sorrow that she might have been a friend . Simultaneously , she mourned the driver of the taxicab in which she had been injured , for he had died at about noon the day before . She had been told this as she lay on a stretcher in the corridor , waiting to be taken to the X-ray room ; an interne , passing by , had paused and smiled down at her and had said , " Your cab-driver is dead . You were lucky . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as daylight was showing on the windows as a murky smear . It was a minute or two before she realized why she was so reluctant to be awake , why her uneasiness amounted almost to alarm . Then she remembered thatp197her nose was to be operated on today . She lay straight and motionless under the seersucker counterpane . Her blood-red eyes in her darned face stared through the window and saw a frozen river and leafless elm trees and a grizzled esplanade where dogs danced on the ends of leashes , their bundled-up owners stumbling after them , half blind with sleepiness and cold . Warm as the hospital room was , it did not prevent Pansy from knowing , as keenly as though she were one of the walkers , how very cold it was outside . Each twig of a nearby tree was stark . Cold red brick buildings nudged the low-lying sky which was pale and inert like a punctured sac . In six weeks , the scene had varied little : there was promise in the skies neither of sun nor of snow ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither die nor leaf out again . Pansy could not remember another season in her life so constant , when the very minutes themselves were suffused with the winter pallor as they dropped from the moon-faced clock in the corridor . Likewise , her room accomplished no alterations from day to day . On the glass-topped bureau stood two potted plants telegraphed by faraway well-wishers . They did not fade , and if a leaf turned brown and fell , it soon was replaced ; so did the blossoms renew themselves . The roots , like the skies and like the bare trees , seemed zealously determined to maintain a status quo . The bedsidetable , covered every day with a clean white towel , though the one removed was always immaculate , was furnished sparsely with a water glass , a bent drinkingp198tube , a sweating pitcher , and a stack of paper handkerchiefs . There were a few letters in the drawer , a hairbrush , a pencil , and some postal cards on which , from time to time , she wrote brief messages to relatives and friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( sic ) and Dr. Rivers says the frontal fracture has all but healed and that the occipital is coming along nicely . Dr. Nicholas , the nose doctor , promises to operate as soon as Dr. Rivers gives him the go-ahead sign ( sic ) . " The bed itself was never rumpled . Once fretful and now convalescent , Miss Vanneman might have been expected to toss or to turn the pillows or to unmoor the counterpane ; but hour after hour and day after day she lay at full length and would not even suffer the nurses to raise the head-piece of the adjustable bed . So perfect and stubborn was her body 's immobility that it was as if the room and the landscape , mortified by the ice , were extensions of herself . Her resolute quiescence and her disinclination to talk , the one seeming somehow to proceed from the other , resembled , so the nurses said , a final coma . And they observed , in pitying indignation , that she might as well be dead for all the interest she took in life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moral weakness : an automobile accident , no matter how serious , was not reason enough for anyone to give up the will to live or to be happy . She had not  --  to come down bluntly to the facts  --  had the decency to be grateful that it was the driver of the cab and not she who had died . ( And how dreadfullyp199the man had died ! ) She was twenty-five years old and she came from a distant city . These were really the only facts known about her . Evidently she had not been here long , for she had no visitors , a lack which was at first sadly moving to the nurses but which became to them a source of unreasonable annoyance : had anyone the right to live so one-dimensionally ? It was impossible to laugh at her , for she said nothing absurd ; her demands could not be complained of because they did not exist ; she could not be hated for a sharp tongue nor for a supercilious one ; she could not be admired for bravery or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was believed to be a frightful snob . Pansy , for her part , took a secret and mischievous pleasure in the bewilderment of her attendants and the more they courted her with offers of magazines , crosswordpuzzles , and a radio that she could rent from the hospital , the farther she retired from them into herself and into the world which she had created in her long hours here and which no one could ever penetrate nor imagine . Sometimes she did not even answer the nurses ' questions ; as they rubbed her back with alcohol and steadily discoursed , she was as remote from them as if she were miles away . She did not think that she lived on a higher plane than that of the nurses and the doctorsbut that she lived on a different one and that at this particular time  --  this time of exploration and habituation  --  shehad no extra strength to spend on making herselfknown to them . All she had been before and all thep200memories she might have brought out to disturb the monotony of , say , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future when she would leave the hospital , were of no present consequence to her . Not even in her thoughts did she employ more than a minimum of memory . And when she did remember , it was in flat pictures , rigorously independent of one another : she saw her thin , poetic mother who grew thinner and more poetic in her canvas deck-chair at Saranac reading Lalla Rookh . She saw herself in an inappropriate pink hat drinking iced tea in a garden so oppressive with the smell of phlox that the tea itself tasted of it . She recalledan afternoon in autumn in Vermont when she had heard three dogs ' voices in the north woods and she could tell , by the characteristic minor key struck three times at intervals , like bells from several churches , that they had treed something : the eastern sky was pink and the trees on the horizon looked like some eccentric vascularsystem meticulously drawn on colored paper . What Pansy thought of all the time was her own brain . Not only the brain as the seat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , romantically , now as a jewel , now as a flower , now as a light in a glass , now as an envelope of rosy vellum containing other envelopes , one within the other , diminishinginfinitely . It was always pink and always fragile , always deeply interior and invaluable . She believed that she had reached the innermost chamber of knowledgeand that perhaps her knowledge was the same asThe Interior Castle 201p201the saint 's achievement of pure love . It was only convention , she thought , that made one say " sacred heart " and not " sacred brain . " Often , but never articulately , the color pink troubled her and the picture of herself in the wrong hat hung steadfastly before her mind 's eye . None of the other girls had worn hats and since autumn had come early that year , they were dressed in green and rusty brown and dark yellow . Poor Pansy wore a white eyelet frock with a lacing of black ribbon around the square neck . When she came through the arch , overhung with bittersweet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she almost turned back , but Mr. Oliver was there and she was in love with him . She was in love with him though he was ten years older than she and had never shown any interest in her beyond asking her once , quite fatuouslybut in an intimate voice , if the yodeling of the little boy who peddled clams did not make her wish to visit Switzerland . Actually , there was more to this questionthan met the eye , for some days later Pansy learned that Mr. Oliver , who was immensely rich , kept an apartment in Geneva . In the garden that day , he spoke to her only once . He said , " My dear , you look exactly like something out of Katherine Mansfield , " and immediatelyturned and within her hearing asked Beatrice Sherburneto dine with him that night at the Country Club . Afterward , Pansy went down to the sea and threw the beautiful hat onto the full tide and saw it vanish in the wake of a trawler . Thereafter , when she heard the clamp202boy coming down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stopped and her mother called down from her chaise longue , " Who was it , dearie ? " she replied , " A salesman . " It was only the fact that the hat had been pink that worried her . The rest of the memory was trivial , for she knew that she could never again love anything as ecstatically as she loved the spirit of Pansy Vanneman , enclosed within her head . But her study was not without distraction , and she fought two adversaries : pain and Dr. Nicholas . Against Dr. Nicholas , she defended herself valorously and in fear ; but pain , the pain , that is , that was independent of his instruments , she sometimes forced upon herself adventurouslylike a child scaring himself in a graveyard . Dr. Nicholas greatly admired her crushed and splinterednose which he daily probed and peered at , exclaimingthat he had never seen anything like it . His shapely hands ached for their knives ; he was impatient with the skull-fracture man 's cautious delay . He spoke of " our " nose and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could breathe again . His own nose was magnificent . Not even his own brilliant surgery could have improved upon it nor could a first-rate sculptor have duplicated its direct downward line which permitted only the least curvature inward toward the end ; nor the delicately rounded lateral declivities ; nor the thinwalled , perfectly matched nostrils . Miss Vanneman did not doubt his humaneness norp203his talent  --  he was a celebrated man  --  but she questionedwhether he had imagination . Immediately beyond the prongs of his speculum lay her treasure whose price he , no more than the nurses , could estimate . She believedhe could not destroy it , but she feared that he might maim it : might leave a scratch on one of the brilliantfacets of the jewel , bruise a petal of the flower , smudge the glass where the light burned , blot the envelopes , and that then she would die or would go mad . While she did not question that in either eventuality her brain would after a time redeem its original impeccability , she did not quite yet wish to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain that she could carry with her her knowledge as well as its receptacle . Blunderer that he was , Dr. Nicholas was an honorableenemy , not like the demon , pain , which skulked in a thousand guises within her head , and which often she recklessly willed to attack her and then drove back in terror . After the rout , sweat streamed from her face and soaked the neck of the coarse hospital shirt . To be sure , it came usually of its own accord , running like a wild fire through all the convolutions to fill with flame the small sockets and ravines and then , at last , to withdraw , leaving behind a throbbing and an echo . On these occasions , she was as helpless as a tree in a wind . But at the other times when , by closing her eyes and rolling up the eyeballs in such a way that she fancied she looked directlyon the place where her brain was , the pain woke sluggishly and came toward her at a snail 's pace . Then ,  |p204bit  by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , subsided altogether , and then it rushed like a tidal wave driven by a hurricane , lashing and roaring until she lifted her hands from the counterpane , crushed her broken teeth into her swollen lip , stared in panic at the soothing walls with her ruby eyes , stretched out her legs until she felt their bones must snap . Each cove , each narrow inlet , every living bay was flooded and the frail brain , a little hat-shaped boat , was washed from its mooring and set adrift . The skull was as vast as the world and the brain was as small as a seashell . Then came calm weather and the safe journey home . She kept vigil for a while , though , and did not close her eyes , but gazing pacifically at the trees , conceived of the pain as the guardian of her treasure who would not let her see it ; that was why she was handled so savagely whenever she turned her eyes inward . Once this watch was interrupted : by chance she looked into the corridor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a senile porter . A pair of ancient eyes , as rheumy as an old dog 's , stared uncritically in at her and a toothless mouth formed a brutish word . She was so surprised that she immediately closed her eyes to shut out the shape of the word and the pain dug up the unmapped regions of her head with mattocks , ludicrously huge . It was the familiarpain , but this time , even as she endured it , she observed with detachment that its effect upon her was less than that of its contents , the by-products , for example , of temporal confusion and the bizarre misappli/cation of the style of one sensation to another . At the moment , for example , although her brain reiterated to her that it was being assailed , she was stroking her right wrist with her left hand as though to assuage the ache , long since dispelled , of the sprain in the joint . Some minutes after she had opened her eyes and left off soothingher wrist , she lay rigid experiencing the sequel to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on several occasions , she was overwhelmed with the knowledge that the pain had been consummated in the vessel of her mind and for the moment the vessel was unbeautiful : she thought , quailing , of those plastic folds as palpable as the fingers of locked hands containing in their very cells , their fissures , their repulsive hemispheres , the mind , the soul , the inscrutable intelligence . The porter , then , like the pink hat and like her mother and the hounds ' voices , loitered with her . Dr. Nicholas came at nine o'clock to prepare her for the operation . With him came an entourage of white-frocked acolytes , and one of them wheeled in a wagon on which lay knives and scissors and pincers , cans of swabs and gauze . In the midst of these was a bowl of liquid whose rich purple color made it seem strange like the brew of an alchemist . " All set ? " the surgeon asked her , smiling . " A little nervous , what ? I do n't blame you . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a submucous resection . "  |p206Pansy  thought for a moment he was going to touch his nose . His approach to her was roundabout . He moved through the yellow light shed by the globe in the ceiling which gave his forehead a liquid gloss ; he paused by the bureau and touched a blossom of the cyclamen ; he looked out the window and said , to no one and to all , " I could n't start my car this morning . Came in a cab . " Then he came forward . As he came , he removed a speculum from the pocket of his short-sleeved coat and like a cat , inquiringof the nature of a surface with its paws , he put out his hand toward her and drew it back , gently murmuring , " You must not be afraid , my dear . There is no danger , you know . Do you think for a minute I would operate if there were ? " Dr. Nicholas , young , brilliant , and handsome , was an aristocrat , a husband , a father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a trustee of his preparatory school . Like many of the medical profession , even those whose specialty was centered on the organ of the basest sense , he interested himself in the psychology of his patients : in several instances , for example , he had found that severe attacks of sinusitis were coincident with emotional crises . Miss Vanneman more than ordinarily captured his fancy since her skull had been fractured and her behavior throughout had been so extraordinary that he felt he was observing at first hand some of the results of shock , that incommensurable element , which frequently were too subtle to see . There was , for example , the matterof her complete passivity during a lumbar puncture ,  |p207re|ports  of which were written down in her history and were enlarged upon for him by Dr. Rivers ' interne who had been in charge . Except for a tremor in her throat and a deepening of pallor , there were no signs at all that she was aware of what was happening to her . She made no sound , did not close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several punctures ; her only reaction had been to the very first one , the morning after she had been brought in . When the interne explained to her that he was going to drain off cerebrospinal fluid which was pressing against her brain , she exclaimed , " My God ! " but it was not an exclamation of fear . The young man had been unable to name what it was he had heard in her voice ; he could only say that it had not been fear as he had observed it in other patients . Dr. Nicholas wondered about her . There was no way of guessing whether she had always had a nature of so tolerant and undemanding a complexion . It gave him a melancholy pleasure to think that before her accident she had been high-spirited and loquacious ; he was moved to think that perhaps she had been a beauty and that when she had first seen her face in the looking glass she had lost all joy in herself . It was very difficult to tell what the face had been , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lopsided . The black stitches the length of the nose , across the saddle , across the cheekbone , showed that there would be unsightly scars . He had ventured once to give her the name of a plastic surgeon but she had only replied with a vague , refusingp208smile . He had hoisted a manly shoulder and said , " You 're the doctor . " Much as he pondered , coming to no conclusions , about what went on inside that pitiable skull , he was , of course , far more interested in the nose , deranged so badly that it would require his topmost skill to restore its functions to it . He would be obliged not only to make a submucous resection , a simple run-of-the-mill operation , but to remove the vomer , always a delicate task but further complicated in this case by the proximity of the bone to the frontal fracture line which conceivably was not entirely closed . If it were not and he operated too soon and if a cold germ then found its way into the opening , his patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye . He wondered if she knew in what potential danger she lay ; he desired to assure her that he had brought his craft to its nearest perfection and that she had nothing to fear of him , but feeling that she was perhaps both ignorant and unimaginative and that such consolation would create a fear rather than dispel one , he held his tongue and came nearer to the bed . Watching him , Pansy could already feel the prongs of his pliers opening her nostrils for the insertion of his fine probers . The pain he caused her with his instrumentswas of a different kind from that which she felt unaided : it was a naked , clean , and vivid pain that made her faint and ill and made her wish to die . Once she had fainted as he ruthlessly explored and after she wasp209brought around , he continued until he had finished his investigation . The memory of this outrage had afterwardseveral times made her cry . This morning she looked at him and listened to him with hatred . Fixing her eyes upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined the clutter behind it and she despised its obtuse imperfection . In his bland unawareness , this nobody , this nose-bigot , was about to play with fire and she wished him ill . He said , " I ca n't blame you . No , I expect you 're not looking forward to our little party . But you 'll be glad to be able to breathe again . " He stationed his lieutenants . The interne stood oppositehim on the left side of the bed . The surgical nurse wheeled the wagon within easy reach of his hands and stood beside it . Another nurse stood at the foot of the bed . A third drew the shades at the windows and attacheda blinding light that shone down on the patient hotly , and then she left the room , softly closing the door . Pansy stared at the silver ribbon tied in a great bow round the green crepe paper of one of the flower pots . It made her realize for the first time that one of the days she had lain here had been Christmas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilling fact , for Dr. Nicholas was genially explaining his anesthetic . He would soak packs of gauze in the purple fluid , a cocaine solution , and he would place them then in her nostrils , leaving them there for an hour . He warned her that the packing would be disagreeable ( he did not say " pain/ful " ) but that it would be well worth a few minutes of discomfort not to be in the least sick after the operation . He asked her if she were ready and when she nodded her bead , he adjusted the mirror on his forehead and began . At the first touch of his speculum , Pansy 's fingers mechanicallybent to the palms of her hands and she stiffened . He said , " A pack , Miss Kennedy , " and Pansy closed her eyes . There was a rush of plunging pain as he drove the sodden gobbet of gauze high up into her nose and something bitter burned in her throat so that she retched . The doctor paused a moment and the surgicalnurse wiped Pansy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing it with his bodkin doggedly until it lodged against the first . Stop ! Stop ! cried all her nerves , wailing along the surface of her skin . The coats that covered them were torn off and they shuddered like naked people screaming , Stop ! Stop ! But Dr. Nicholas did not hear . Time and again he came back with a fresh pack and did not pause at all until one nostril was finished . She opened her eyes and saw him wipe the sweat off his forehead and saw the dark interne bending over her , fascinated . Miss Kennedy bathed her temples in ice water and Dr. Nicholas said , " There . It wo n't be much longer . I 'll tell them to send you some coffee , though I 'm afraid you wo n't be able to taste it . Ever drink coffeewith chicory in it ? I have no use for it . " She snatched at his irrelevancy and , though she had never tasted chicory , she said severely , " I love it . "  |p211Dr  . Nicholas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Kennedy . " The second nostril was harder to pack since the other side was now distended and this passage was anyhow much narrower , as narrow , he had once remarked , as that in the nose of an infant . In such pain as passed all language and even the farthest fetched analogies , she turned her eyes inward thinking that under the obscuringcloak of the surgeon 's pain , she could see her brain without the knowledge of its keeper . But Dr. Nicholas and his aides would give her no peace . They surrounded her with their murmuring and their foot-shuffling and the rustling of their starched uniforms , and her eyelids continually flew back in embarrassment and mistrust . She was claimed entirely by this present , meaningless pain and suddenly and sharply she forgot what she had meant to do . She was aware of nothing but her ascent to the summit of something ; what it was she did not know , whether it was a tower or a peak or Jacob 's ladder . Now she was an abstract word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a kite flying , a top spinning , a prism flashing , a kaleidoscope turning . But none of the others in the room could see inside when the surgeon was finished , the nurse at the foot of the bed said , " Now you must take a look in the mirror . It 's simply too comical . " And they all laughed intimatelylike old , fast friends . She smiled politely and looked at her reflection : over the gruesomely fattened snout , her scarlet eyes stared in fixed reproach upon herp212upturned lips , gray with bruises . But even in its smile of betrayal , the mouth itself was puzzled : it reminded her that something had been left behind , but she could not recall what it was . She was hollowed out and was as dry as a white bone . They strapped her ankles to the operating table and put leather nooses round her wrists . Over her head was a mirror with a thousand facets in which she saw a thousandtravesties of her face . At her right side was the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the many knives , thrusting out fitful rays of light . All the cloth was frosty ; everything was white or silver and as cold as snow . Dr. Nicholas , a tall snowman with silver eyes and silver fingernails , came into the room soundlessly for he walked on layers and layers of snow that deadened his footsteps ; behind him came the interne , a smaller snowman , less impressively proportioned . At the foot of the table , a snow figure put her frozen hands upon Pansy 's helpless feet . The doctor plucked the packs from the cold , numb nose . His laugh was like a cry on a bitter , still night : " I will show you now , " he called across the expanse of snow , " that you can feel nothing . " The pincers bit at nothing , snapped at the air and cracked a nerveless icicle . Pansy called back and heard her own voice echo : " I feel nothing . " Here the walls were gray , not tan . Suddenly the face of the nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it was in grief . But it was a smile and she said , " Did you enjoy your coffee ? " Down the gray corridors of the maze , the words rippled , ran like mice , birds , broken beads : Did you enjoy your coffee ? your coffee ? your coffee ? Similarly once in another room that also had gray walls , the same voice had said , " Shall I give her some whisky ? " She was overcome with gratitude that this young woman ( how pretty she was with her white hair and her white face and her china-blue eyes ! ) had been with her that first night and was with her now . In the great stillness of the winter , the operation began . The knives carved snow . Pansy was happy . She had been given a hypnotic just before they came to fetch her and she would have gone to sleep had she not enjoyed so much this trickery of Dr. Nicholas ' whom now she tenderly loved . There was a clock in the operating room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour passed . The snowman'sface was melting ; drops of water hung from his fine nose , but his silver eyes were as bright as ever . Her love was returned , she knew : he loved her nose exactly as she loved his knives . She looked at her face in the domed mirror and saw how the blood had streaked her lily-white cheeks and had stained her shroud . She returned to the private song : Did you enjoy your coffee ? your coffee ? At the half-hour , a murmur , anguine and slumbrous , came to her and only when she had repeated the wordsp214twice did they engrave their meaning upon her . Dr. Nicholas said , " Stand back now , nurse . I 'm at this girl 's brain and I do n't want my elbow jogged . " Instantly Pansy was alive . Her strapped ankles arched angrily ; her wrists strained against their bracelets . She jerked her head and she felt the pain flare ; she had made the knife slip . " Be still ! " cried the surgeon . " Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was she had lost when he had rammed his gauze into her nose : she bustledlike a housewife to shut the door . She thought , I must hurry before the robbers come . It would be like the time Mother left the cellar door open and the robber came and took , of all things , the terrarium . Dr. Nicholas was whispering to her . He said , in the voice of a lover , " If you can stand it five minutes more , I can perform the second operation now and you wo n't have to go through this again . What do you say ? " She did not reply . It took her several seconds to rememberwhy it was her mother had set such store by the terrarium and then it came to her that the bishop 's widow had brought her an herb from Palestine to put in it . The interne said , " You do n't want to have your nose packed again , do you ? " The surgical nurse said , " She 's a good patient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better , " replied Dr. Nicholas . " Butp215do n't call me sir . ' You must be a Canadian to call me sir . ' " The nurse at the foot of the bed said , " I 'll order some more coffee for you . " " How about it , Miss Vanneman ? " said the doctor . " Shall I go ahead ? " She debated . Once she had finally fled the hospital and fled Dr. Nicholas , nothing could compel her to come back . Still , she knew that the time would come when she could no longer live in seclusion , she must go into the world again and must be equipped to live in it ; she banally acknowledged that she must be able to breathe . And finally , though the world to which she would return remained unreal , she gave the surgeon her permission . He had now to penetrate regions that were not anesthetizedand this he told her frankly , but he said that there was no danger at all . He apologized for the slip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had not been near her brain , it was only a figure of speech . He began . The knives ground and carved and curried and scoured the wounds they made ; the scissors clipped hard gristle and the scalpels chipped off bone . It was as if a tangle of tiny nerves were being cut dexterously , one by one ; the pain writhed spirally and came to her who was a pink bird and sat on the top of a cone . The pain was a pyramid made of a diamond ; it was an intense light ; it was the hottest fire , the coldest chill , the highest peak , the fastest force , the furthest reach , the newestp216time . It possessed nothing of her but its one infinitesimal scene : beyond the screen as thin as gossamer , the brain trembled for its life , hearing the knives hunting like wolves outside , sniffing and snapping . Mercy ! Mercy ! cried the scalped nerves . At last , miraculously , she turned her eyes inward tranquilly . Dr. Nicholas had said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on the floor of your nose , " and at his signal she closed her eyes and this time and this time alone , she saw her brain lying in a shell-pink satin case . It was a pink pearl , no bigger than a needle 's eye , but it was so beautiful and so pure that its smallness made no difference . Anyhow , as she watched , it grew . It grew larger and larger until it was an enormous bubblethat contained the surgeon and the whole room within its rosy luster . In a long ago summer , she had often been absorbed by the spectacle of flocks of yellow birds that visited a cedar tree and she remembered that everythingthat summer had been some shade of yellow . One year of childhood , her mother had frequently taken her to have tea with an aged schoolmistress upon whose mantelpiece there was a herd of ivory elephants ; that had been the white year . There was a green spring when early in April she had seen a grass snake on a boulder , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's garden . She saw a swatch of blue tulle lying in a raffia basket on the front porch of Uncle Marion 's brown house . Never before had the world been pink , whatever else it had been . Or had it been ,  |p217one  other time ? She could not be sure and she did not care . Of one thing she was certain : never had the world enclosed her before and never had the quiet been so smooth . For only a moment the busybodies left her to her ecstasy and then , impatient and gossiping , they forced their way inside , slashed at her resisting trance with questions and congratulations , with statements of fact and jokes . " Later , " she said to them dumbly . " Later on , perhaps . I am busy now . " But their voices would not go away . They touched her , too , washing her face with cloths so cold they stung , stroking her wrists with firm , antiseptic fingers . The surgeon , squeezing her arm with avuncular pride , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a bright dog that had retrieved a bone . Her silent mind abused him : " You are a thief , " it said , " you are heartlessand you should be put to death . " But he was leaving , adjusting his coat with an air of vainglory , and the interne , abject with admiration , followed him from the operating room smiling like a silly boy . Shortly after they took her back to her room , the weather changed , not for the better . Momentarily the sun emerged from its concealing murk , but in a few minutes the snow came with a wind that promised a blizzard . There was great pain , but since it could not serve her , she rejected it and she lay as if in a hammockin a pause of bitterness . She closed her eyes , shuttingherself up within her treasureless head.  |p219The  celebrated trade winds of the Caribbean had , unseasonably , ceased to blow , and over the island a horrid stillness tarried . The ships in the glassy harbor appeared becalmed , and nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scuttering through the purple bougainvillaea , whose burdened branches touched the borders of the patio . The puny cats that ate the lizards slept stupefied under the hibiscus hedges . Once , a man-o ' - war bird sailed across the yellow sky ; once , a bushy burro strayed up the hill through the tall , hissing guinea grass and , pausing , gazed aloft with an expression of babyish melancholy ; now and then , the wood doves sang sadly in the turpentine trees behind Captain Sundstrom 's house . The Captain 's guests , who had been swimming and sunning all morning at his beach below and then had eaten his protracted Danish lunch of multitudinous hors d'oeuvres and an aspic of fish and a ragout of kid and salads and pancakes , now sat on the gallery drinking gin-and-Schweppes . Their conversation dealt largely with the extraordinary weather , and the residents of the island were at pains to assure the visitors that this un/wholesome , breathless pause did not presage a hurricane , for it was far too early in the year . Their host predictedthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fill the cisterns to the brim . At times , the tone of the talk was chauvinistic ; the islanders asked the outlanders to agree with them that , unpleasant as this might be , it was nothing like the villainous summer heat of Washingtonor New York . Here , at any rate , one dressed in sensibledecolletage  --  the Captain 's eyes browsed over the bare shoulders of his ladies  --  and did not shorten one 's life by keeping up the winter 's fidgets in the summertime . Why people who were not obliged to live in the North did , he could not understand . It was a form of masochism , was it not , frankly , to condemn oneself needlessly to the tantrums of a capricious climate ? TemperateZone , indeed ! There was no temperance north of Key West . The visitors civilly granted that their lives were not ideal , they were politely envious of the calm and leisure here , and some of them committed themselves to the extent of asking about the prices of real estate . If the talk digressed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the municipal politics , which were forever a bear garden ; to the dear or the damnable peccadilloes of absent friends ; to servant-robbers from the States ; to the revenue the merchants and restaurateurshad acquired in their shops and bars when the last cruise ship was in , full to her gunwhales of spendthrift boobs . And they talked of the divorcees-to-be who lit/tered the terraces and lounges of the hotels , idling through their six weeks ' quarantine , with nothing in the world to do but bathe in the sun and the sea , and drink , and haunt the shops for tax-free bargains in French perfume . They were spoken of as invalids ; they were said to be here for " the cure . " Some of them did look ill and shocked , as if , at times , they could not remember why they had come . It was made plain that the divorcees who were among the gathering today were different from the rest ; they were not bores about the husbands they were chucking ; they did not flirt with married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy with the natives ( a noteworthy woman from Utica , some months before , had brought a station wagon with her and daily could be seen driving along the country roads with a high-school boy as black as your hat beside her ) ; and they fitted so well into the life of the island that the islanders would like to have them settle here or , at least , come back to pay a visit . Mrs. Baumgartner , a delicious blonde whose husband had beaten her with a ski pole in the railroad station at Boise , Idaho ( she told the story very amusingly but it was evident that the man had been a beast ) , and who meant to marry again the moment she legally could , announced that she intended to return here for her honeymoon . Captain Sundstrom reasonably proposed that she not go back to the States at all but wait here until the proper time had passed and then send for her new husband . It would be droll if the same judge who had setp222her free performed the ceremony . Crowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest until that time . A lumbering fourth-generation Dane , and now an American citizen , he had a face like a boar ; the nares of his snout were as broad as a native 's and his lips were as thick and as smooth . By his own profession to every woman he met , he was a gourmet and a sybarite . He liked the flavor of colonial argot and would tell her , " My bed and board are first-chop , " as he slowly winked a humid blue eye . He had never married , because he had known that his would be the experience of his charming guests ; it was a nuisance , was n't it , to assign six weeks of one 's life to the correction of a damn-fool mistake ? Who could fail to agree that his was the perfectlife , here on a hillside out of the town , with so magnificenta view that it was no trouble at all to lure the beauties to enjoy his hospitality . Mufti for the Captain today consisted solely of linen trunks with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his furred flesh wrapped his mammoth bones in coils . At the beach that morning , he had endlessly regretted that there were no French bathing suits , and privily he had told Sophie Otis that he hoped that before she left , he would have the opportunity of seeing her in high-heeled shoes and black stockings . To Mrs. Otis , who had left the rest of the party and was sitting just below the gallery on a stone bench in the garden in front of the house , this two-dimensional and too pellucid world seemed all the world ; it was notp223possible to envisage another landscape , even when she closed her eyes and called to mind the sober countryside of Massachusetts under snow , for the tropics trespassed , overran , and spoiled the image with their heavy , heady smells and their wanton colors . She could not gain the decorous smell of pine forests when the smell of nightbloomingcereus was so arrogant in her memory ; it had clung and cloyed since the evening before , like a mouthful of bad candy . Nor was it possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as if the clocks , like the winds , had been arrested , and all endeavourwere ended and all passion were a fait accompli , for nothing could strive or love in a torpor so insentient . She found it hard to understand Mrs. Baumgartner'senergy , which could perpetrate a plan so involvingof the heart . She herself was nearly at the end of her exile and in another week would go , but while she had counted the days like a child before Christmas , now she could not project herself beyond the present anesthesiaand felt that the exile had only just begun and that she was doomed forever to remain within the immobileupheaval of this hot , lonesome Sunday sleep , with the voices of strangers thrumming behind her and no other living thing visible or audible in the expanse of arid hills and in the reach of bright-blue sea . It was fitting , she concluded , that one come to such a place as this to repudiate struggle and to resume the earlier , easier indolence of lovelessness . On the ground beside her lay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its pedestal by a storm that had passed here long ago . A bay leaf was impaled on one of the horns and part of the randy , sinful grin was visible , but the eyes addressed the ground and the scatteredblue blossoms from the lignum vitae tree above . Prurient and impotent , immortalized in its romantically promiscuous corruption , the shard was like the signatureof the garden 's owner , who now , sprawled in a long planter 's chair , was telling those who had not heard of it the grisly little contretemps that had taken place the night before aboard the Danish freighter that still lay in the harbor . Twelve hours before she entered , a member of her crew , a Liberian , had fallen from the mast he was painting and had died at once , of a fractured skull . Although it was the custom of the island to bury the dead , untreated , within twenty-four hours , the health authorities , under pressure from the ship 's captain , agreed , at last , to embalm the body , to be shipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found , " said Captain Sundstrom , " that the nigger 's head was such a mess that the embalmingfluid would n't stay in , so they had to plant the bugger , after all . We have n't got enough of our own coons , we have to take care of this stray jigaboo from Liberia , what ? " He appealed to little Mrs. Fairweather , a high-principled girl in her middle twenties , who had fanatically learned tolerance in college , and who now rose to his bait , as she could always be counted on to do ,  |p225and  all but screamed her protest at his use of the words " nigger " and " coon " and " jigaboo . " " Now , now , " said the Captain , taking her small ringlesshand , " you 're much too pretty to preachify . " She snatched away her hand and glared at him with hatred and misery ; she was the most unhappy of all the divorcees , because it had been her husband 's idea , and not hers , that she come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socks for him , in spite of everything , the tears falling among the network of bobbins . She took the current pair out of her straw beach bag now , and her needles began to set up a quiet , desperate racket . Half pitying , half amused , the company glanced at her a moment and then began their talk again , going on to other cases of emergency burials and other cases of violent death on these high seas . Mrs. Otis had brought the Captain 's binoculars to the garden with her , and she turned away from the people on the porch to survey the hills , where nothing grew but bush and , here and there , a grove of the gray , leafless trees they called cedars , whose pink blossoms were shaped like horns and smelled like nutmeg ; they did what they could , the cedar flowers , to animate the terrain , but it was little enough , although sometimes , from a distance , they looked beautifully like a shower of apple blossoms . She peered beyond the termination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic , crouching like cats on the unnatural sea . Theyp226were intractably dry , and yet there was a sense everywhereof lives gathering fleshily and quietly , of an incessant , somnolent feeding , of a brutish instinct cleverer than any human thought . Some weeks before , from a high elevation on another island , through another pair of glasses , she had found the great mound of the island of Jost Van Dykes and had just made out its two settlementsand its long , thin beaches , and she had found , as well , a separate house , halfway up the island 's steep ascent , set in a waste as sheer as a rain catchment , where only one tree grew . And the tree was as neat and simple as a child 's drawing . She had quickly put the glasses down , feeling almost faint at the thought of the terrible and absolute simplicity with which a life would have to be led in a place so wanting in shadow and in hiding places , fixed so nakedly to the old , juiceless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to the evidences on the gallery of the prudent tricks and the solacing subterfuges of civilization ; even here , as in the cities of their former days , the expatriates had managed to escape the aged , wickedly sagacious earth . See how , with optimism , gin , jokes , and lechery , they could deny even this satanic calm and heat ! Mr. Robertson , the liquor merchant , was explaining the activities of the peacetime Army here to a CocaColasalesman who had stopped off for a few days on the island en route from Haiti to the Argentine . Robertson , a former rumrunner and Captain Sundstrom 's best friend , was as skinny as one of the island cats , and hisp227skeleton was crooked and his flesh was cold . His eyes , through inappropriate pince-nez , mirrored no intellect at all but only a nasty appetite . He was a heliophobe and could never let the sun touch him anywhere , and so , in this country of brown skins and black ones , he always looked like a newcomer from the North and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left his hospital bed too soon . On the beach that morning , he had worn a hat with a visor and had sat under an enormousumbrella and had further fended off the sun by holding before his face a partially eviscerated copy of Esquire . In spite of his looks , he was a spark as ardent as the Captain , and lately , while his wife had been ailing , he had cut rather a wide swath , he claimed ; all day he had giggled gratefully at his friends ' charges that he had been stalking the native Negro women and the pert little French tarts from Cha Cha Town . Rumor had it , he told the salesman , that a laboratory was presently to be set up on an outlying cay for the investigation of the possible values of biological warfare . The noxious vapors would be carried out to sea . ( To kill the fancy , flashy fish weaving through the coral reefs , wondered Mrs. Otis , half listening . ) Captain Sundstrom , who was connected with the project , turned again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sally with a long chuckle , he said , " We 're hunting for a virus that will kill off all the niggers but wo n't hurt anybody else . We call it coon bane . ' " One of the kitchen boys had just come out onto the gallery with a fresh bucket ofp228ice , but there was no expression at all on his long , incuriousface , not even when Mrs. Fairweather , actually crying now , sobbed , " Hush ! " The Coca-Cola man , in violent embarrassment , began at once to tell the companythe story of an encounter he had had in Port-auPrincewith an octoroon midget from North Carolina named Sells Floto , but his heart was not in it , and it was clear that his garrulity was tolerated only out of good manners . Mrs. Otis picked up the binoculars again and found the beach . For some time , she watched a pair of pelicans that sat on the tideless water , preposterously permanent , like buoys , until their greed came on them and they rose heavily , flapped seaward for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inexpert splash , and came up with a fish to fling into their ridiculous beaks . The wide-leaved sea grapes along the ivory shingle were turning brown and yellow , a note of impossible autumn beside that bay , where the shimmer of summer was everlasting . Mrs. Otis shifted her focus to the grove of coconutpalms that grew to the north of the curve of the ocean , and almost at once , as if they had been waiting for her , there appeared , at the debouchment of one of the avenues , a parade of five naked Negro children leading a little horse exactly the color of themselves . The smallest child walked at the head of the line and the tallest held the bridle . But a middle-sized one was in command , and when they had gained the beach , he broke the orderly procession and himself took the bridlep229and led the horse right up to Captain Sundstrom 's blue cabana . If her ears had not been aided by her eyes , Mrs. Otis thought she would not have heard the distant cries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly and softly across the stunted trees . The children reconnoiteredfor a while , looking this way and that , now stepping off the distance between the cabana and the water , now running like sandpipers toward the coconut grove and back again . Then the smallest and the tallest , helped by the others , mounted the horse ; it was a lengthy process , because the helpers had to spin and prance about to relieve their excitement , and sometimes they forgot themselves altogether for an absent-minded minute and ran to peer through the cracks of the closed-up cabana ; then they returned to the business at hand with refreshed attention . When the riders were seated , one of the smaller children ran back to the grove and returned with a switch , which he handed up to the tall child . The horse , at the touch of the goad , lifted his head and whinnied and then charged into the water , spilling his cargo , only to be caught promptly and mounted by two others who had run out in his wake . They , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tried and failed to ride him more than a few yards , until , at last , the middle-sized ruler managed to stick and to ride out all the way to the reef and back again . The cheers were like the cries of sea birds . The champion rested , lying flat on the sand before the cabana , and for a whilep230the others lay around him like the spokes of a wheel , while the horse shuddered and stomped . On the gallery , the Captain had noticed the children . " Cheeky little beggars , muckering around on my beach , but I 'll let them have it . I 'm a freethinker , what ? " he said ; then , turning to Mrs. Fairweather , " I 'm going to give you a fat little blackamoor to take back with you , to remind you of our island paradise , what ? " Mr. Robertson said , " Do n't let him rile you , honey . For all his big talk , he 's softer about them than you are . " He leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Get me ? " he cried . The Captain laughed and slapped his leg . " The whole thing 's a lie , that 's what it is , you outlaw ! " " It 's a lie if the gospel truth 's a lie , " said Robertson . Mrs. Fairweather did not look up from her knitting , even though he was as close to her as if he meant to bite or kiss her . " Listen , kiddo , when I first knew him , he used to be all the time saying what he wanted most of all in the world to do was eat broiled pickaninny . All the time thinking of his stomach . So one day I said to him , All right , damn it , you damned well will one of these fine days ! ' " Mrs. Baumgartner gasped , and one of the other women said , " Oh , really , Rob , you 're such a fool . Everyoneknows that our slogan here is Live and let live . ' " But Robertson wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Well , sir , a little while after I made that historic declaration , there was a fire in Polly/berg , just below my house , and I moseyed down to have a look-see . " " Let 's not talk about fires ! " cried Mrs. Baumgartner . " I was in a most frightful one in Albany and had to go down a ladder in my nightie . " Captain Sundstrom whistled and blew her a noisy kiss . " They had got it under control by the time I got there , and everyone had left , " pursued the liquor merchant . " I took a look in the front door and I smelled the best goddamned smell I ever smelled in my life , just possibly barring the smell of roasting duck . Here 's Sundstrom 's dinner , ' I said to myself , and , sure enough , I poked around a little and found a perfectly cooked baby  --  around ten and a half pounds , I 'd say . " The Coca-Cola salesman , who , all along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Robertson'spause for breath and announced that he knew a man who had his shoes made of alligator wallets from Rio . Robertson glanced at him coldly , ignored the interruption , and went on speaking directly to Mrs. Fairweather . " It was charred on the outside , naturally , but I knew it was bound to be sweet and tender inside . So I took him home and called up this soldier of fortune here and told him to come along for dinner . I heated the toddler up and put him on a platter and garnished him with parsley and one thing or another , and you never saw a tastier dish in your life . "  |p232The  Coca-Cola man , turning pale , stood up and said , " What 's the matter with you people here ? You ought to shoot yourself for telling a story like that . " But Robertson said to Mrs. Fairweather , " And what do you think he did after all the trouble I 'd gone to ? Refused to eat any of it , the sentimentalist ! And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay back in their chairs and laughed until they coughed , but there was not a sound from anyone else and the islanders looked uneasilyfrom one visitor to another ; when their reproachfuleyes fell on their host or on his friend , their look said , " There are limits . " Suddenly , Mrs. Fairweather threw a glass on the stone floor and it exploded like a shot . Somewhere in the house , a dog let out a howl of terror at the sound , and the kitchen boy came running . He ran , cringing , sidewise like a land crab , and the Captain , seeing him , hollered , " Now , damn you , what do you want ? Have you been eavesdropping ? " " No , mon , " said the boy , flinching . There was no way of knowing by his illegible face whether he told the truth or not . He ran back faster than he had come , as if he were pursued . The Captain stood up to make a new drink for Mrs. Fairweather , to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat staring at the fragments of glass glinting at her feet , as if she had reached the climax of some terrible pain.  | " Oh , this heat ! " said Mrs. Baumgartner , and fanned herself gracefully with her straw hat . Something had alarmed the children on the beach below , and Mrs. Otis , turning to look at them again , saw them abruptly immobilized ; then , as silently and as swiftly as sharks , they led the horse away and disappeared into the palm grove , leaving no traces of themselvesbehind . Until she saw them go , she had not been aware that the skies were darkening , and she wondered how long ago the transformation had begun . Now , from miles away , there rolled up a thunderclap , and , as always in the tropics , the rain came abruptly , battling the trees and lashing the vines , beheading the flowers , crashingonto the tin roofs , and belaboring the jalousies of Captain Sundstrom 's pretty house . Blue blossoms showeredthe head of Pan . Wrapping the field glasses in her sash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gallery , and when the boy brought out a towel to her  --  for in those few minutes she had got soaked to the skin  --  she observed that he wore a miraculous medal under his open shirt . She looked into his eyes and thought , Angels and ministers of grace defend you . The gaze she met humbled her , for its sagacious patience showed that he knew his amulet protected him against an improbable world . His was all the sufferance and suffering of little children . In his ambiguous tribulation , he sympathized with her , and with great dignity he received the towel , heavy with - rain , when she had dried herself.  | " See ? " said Captain Sundstrom to his guests , with a gesture toward the storm . " We told you this heat was only an interlude . " And feeling that the long drinks were beginning to pall , he set about making a shaker of Martinis.  |p237Through  the wide doorway between two of the painting galleries , Emma saw Alfred Eisenburg standing before " The Three Miracles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sorrowing , his gaunt frame looking undernourished , and dressed in a way that showed he was poorer this year than he had been last . Emma herself had been hunting for the Botticelli all afternoon , sidetracked first by a Mantegna she had forgotten , and then by a follower of Hieronymus Bosch , and distracted , in an English room as she was passing through , by the hot invective of two ladies who were lodged ( so they bitterly reminded one another ) in an outrageous and expensive mare's-nest at a hotel on Madison . Emma liked Alfred , and once , at a party in some other year , she had flirted with him slightly for seven or eight minutes . It had been spring , and even into that modern apartment , wherever it had been , while the cunning guests , on their guard and highly civilized , learnedly disputed on aesthetic and political subjects , the feeling of spring had boldly invaded , adding its nameless , sentimentalsensations to all the others of the buffeted heart ; one did not know and never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a feeling of tension or of solution  --  whether one flew or drowned . In another year , she would have been pleased to run into Alfred here in the Metropolitan on a cold Sunday , when the galleries were thronged with out-of-towners and with people who dutifully did something self-educatingon the day of rest . But this year she was hiding from just such people as Alfred Eisenburg , and she turned quickly to go back the way she had come , past the Constables and Raeburns . As she turned , she came face to face with Salvador Dali , whose sudden countenance , with its unlikely mustache and its histrionic eyes , familiar from the photographs in public places , momentarily stopped her dead , for she did not immediatelyrecognize him and , still surprised by seeing Eisenburg , took him also to be someone she knew . She shudderedand then realized that he was merely famous , and she penetrated the heart of a guided tour and proceeded safely through the rooms until she came to the balcony that overlooks the medieval armor , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joints of an equestrian 's shell . She paused because she could not decide what to look at now that she had been denied the Botticelli . She wondered , rather crossly , why Alfred Eisenburg was looking at it and why , indeed , he was here at all . She feared that her afternoon , begun in such a burst of courage , would not be what it might have been ; for this second 's glimpse of him  --  who had no bearing on her life  --  mightp239very well divert her from the pictures , not only because she was reminded of her ignorance of painting by the presence of someone who was ( she assumed ) versed in it but because her eyesight was now bound to be impairedby memory and conjecture , by the irrelevant mind-portraits of innumerable people who belonged to Eisenburg 's milieu . And almost at once , as she had predicted , the air separating her from the schoolboys below was populated with the images of composers , of painters , of writers who pronounced judgments , in their individualargot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rubens , Baudelaire , on Stalin and Freud and Kierkegaard , on Toynbee , Frazer , Thoreau , Franco , Salazar , Roosevelt , Maimonides , Racine , Wallace , Picasso , Henry Luce , Monsignor Sheen , the Atomic Energy Commission , and the movie industry . And she saw herselfmoving , shaky with apprehensions and Martinis , and with the belligerence of a child who feels himself laughed at , through the apartments of Alfred Eisenburg'sfriends , where the shelves were filled with everyonefrom Aristophanes to Ring Lardner , where the walls were hung with reproductions of Seurat , Titian , Vermeer , and Klee , and where the record cabinets began with Palestrina and ended with Copland . These cocktail parties were a modus vivendi in themselves for which a new philosophy , a new ethic , and a new etiquette had had to be devised . They were neither work nor play , and yet they were not at all beside the point but were , on the contrary , quite indispensable top240the spiritual life of the artists who went to them . It was possible for Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abstention from them , but it was still not possible to understand them , for they were so special a case , and so unlike any parties she had known at home . The gossip was different , for one thing , because it was stylized , creative ( integrating the whole of the garrotted , absent friend ) , and all its details were precise and all its conceits were Jamesian , and all its practitioners sorrowfully saw themselves in the role of Pontius Pilate , that hero of the untoward circumstance . ( It has to be done , though we do n't want to do it ; ' t is a pity she 's a whore , when no one writes more intelligent verse than she . ) There was , too , the matter of the drinks , which were much worse than those served by anyone else , and much more plentiful . They dispensed with the fripperiesof olives in Martinis and cherries in Manhattans ( God forbid ! They had no sweet teeth ) , and half the time there was no ice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be suspect shavings got from a bed for shad at the corner fish store . Other species , so one heard , went off to dinner after cocktail parties certainly no later than half past eight , but no one ever left a party given by an Olympian until ten , at the earliest , and then groups went out together , stalling and squabbling at the door , angrily unable to come to a decision about where to eat , although they seldom ate once they got there but , with the greatest formality imaginable , orderedseveral rounds of cocktails , as if they had not hadp241a drink in a month of Sundays . But the most surprising thing of all about these parties was that every now and again , in the middle of the urgent , general conversation , this cream of the enlightened was horribly curdled , and an argument would end , quite literally , in a bloody nose or a black eye . Emma was always astounded when this happened and continued to think that these outbursts did . not arise out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost a reflex , almost something physical . She never quite believed her eyes  --  that is , was never altogether convinced that they were really beating one another up . It seemed , rather , that this was only a deliberate and perfectly honest demonstration of what might have happened often if they had not so diligently dedicated themselves to their intellects . Althoughshe had seen them do it , she did not and could not believe that city people clipped each other 's jaws , for , to Emma , urban equaled urbane , and ichor ran in these Augustans ' veins . As she looked down now from her balcony at the atrocious iron clothes below , it occurred to her that Alfred Eisenburg had been just such a first-generation metropolitan boy as these two who half knelt in lithe and eager attitudes to study the glittering splints of a knight 's skirt . It was a kind of childhood she could not imagine and from the thought of which she turned away in secret , shameful pity . She had been really stunned when she first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met had gluttonously read Dickens , as she had , beginningat the age of ten , and because she was only twenty when she arrived in the city and unacquainted with the varieties of cultural experience , she had acquiredthe idea , which she was never able to shake entirelyloose , that these New York natives had been deprivedof this and many other innocent pleasures because they had lived in apartments and not in two- or three-story houses . ( In the early years in New York , she had known someone who had not heard a cat purr until he was twenty-five and went to a houseparty on Fire Island . ) They had played hide-and-seek dodging behind ash cans instead of lilac bushes and in and out of the entries of apartment houses instead of up alleys densely lined with hollyhocks . But who was she to patronizeand pity them ? Her own childhood , rich as it seemed to her on reflection , had not equipped her to read , or to see , or to listen , as theirs had done ; she enviedthem and despised them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared and admired them . As their attitude implicitly accused her , before she beat her retreat , she never looked for meanings , she never saw the literary-historical symbolism of the cocktail party but went on , despite all testimony to the contrary , believing it to be an occasion for getting drunk . She never listened , their manner delicately explained , and when she talked she was always lamentably off key ; often and often she had been stared at and had been told , " It 's not the same thing at all . "  |p243Emma  shuddered , scrutinizing this nature of hers , which they all had scorned , as if it were some harmless but sickening reptile . Noticing how cold the marble railing was under her hands , she felt that her self-blame was surely justified ; she came to the Metropolitan Museumnot to attend to the masterpieces but to remember cocktail parties where she had drunk too much and had seen Alfred Eisenburg , and to watch schoolboys , and to make experience out of the accidental contact of the palms of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to do ? One thing , anyhow , was clear and that was that today 's excursion into the world had been premature ; her solitude must continue for a while , and perhaps it would never end . If the sight of someone so peripheral , so uninvolving , as Alfred Eisenburg could scare her so badly , what would a cocktail party do ? She almost fainted at the thought of it , she almost fell headlong , and the boys , abandoning the coat of mail , dizzied her by their progress toward an emblazoned tabard . In so many words , she was n't fit to be seen . Althoughshe was no longer mutilated , she was still unkempt ; her pretensions needed brushing ; her ambiguitiesneeded to be cleaned ; her evasions would have to be completely overhauled before she could face again the terrifying learning of someone like Alfred Eisenburg , a learning whose components cohered into a central personality that was called " intellectual . " She imagined that even the boys down there had opinions on everything political and artistic and metaphysical andp244scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her opportunities , as green as grass , she was certain they had got their head start because they had grown up in apartments , where there was nothing else to do but educatethemselves . This being an intellectual was not the same thing as dilettantism ; it was a calling in itself . For example , Emma did not even know whether Eisenburgwas a painter , a writer , a composer , a sculptor , or something entirely different . When , seeing him with the composers , she had thought he was one of them ; when , the next time she met him , at a studio party , she decided he must be a painter ; and when , on subsequent occasions , everything had pointed toward his being a writer , she had relied altogether on circumstantial evidence and not on anything he had said or done . There was no reason to suppose that he had not looked upon her as the same sort of variable and it made their anonymity to one another complete . Without the testimony of an impartial third person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual trade . But his specialty did not matter , for his larger designation was that of " the intellectual , " just as the man who confines his talents to the nose and throat is still a doctor . It was , in the light of this , all the more extraordinary that they had had that lightning-paced flirtation at a party . Extraordinary , because Emma could not look upon herself as an intellectual . Her private antonym of this noun was " rube , " and to her regret  --  the regret that had caused her finally to disappear from Alfred 's group  --   |p245she  was not even a bona-fide rube . In her store clothes , so to speak , she was often taken for an intellectual , for she had , poor girl , gone to college and had never been quite the same since . She would not dare , for instance , go up to Eisenburg now and say that what she most liked in the Botticelli were the human and compassionate eyes of the centurions ' horses , which reminded her of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adored as a child . Nor would she admit that she was delighted with a Crivelli Madonna because the peaches in the background looked exactly like marzipan , or that Goya 's little red boy inspired in her only the pressing desire to go out immediately in search of a plump cat to stroke . While she knew that feelings like these were not really punishable , she had not perfected the art of tossing them off ; she was no flirt . She was a bounty jumper in the war between Great-Uncle Graham 's farm and New York City , and liable to court-martial on one side and death on the other . Neither staunchly primitive nor confidently au courant , she rarely knew where she was at . And this was her Achilles ' heel : her identity was always mistaken , and she was thought to be an intellectualwho , however , had not made the grade . It was no use now to cry that she was not , that she was a simonpurerube ; not a soul would believe her . She knew , deeply and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was possible to be highly successful as a rube among the Olympians , and she had seen it done . Some/one calling himself Nahum Mothersill had done it brilliantly , but she often wondered whether his name had not helped him , and , in fact , she had sometimes wondered whether that had been his real name . If she had been called , let us say , Hyacinth Derryberry , she believedshe might have been able , as Mothersill had been , to ask who Ezra Pound was . ( This struck her suddenly as a very important point ; it was endearing , really , not to know who Pound was , but it was only embarrassing to know who he was but not to have read the " Cantos . " ) How different it would have been if education had not meddled with her rustic nature ! Her education had never dissuaded her from her convictions , but certainly it had ruined the looks of her mind  --  painted the poor thing up until it looked like a mean , hypocritical , promiscuousmalcontent , a craven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe ( but never to confess ) that the apple Eve had eaten tasted exactly like those she had eaten when she was a child visiting on her Great-Uncle Graham 's farm , and that Newton 's observationwas no news in spite of all the hue and cry . Half the apples she had eaten had fallen out of the tree , whose branches she had shaken for this very purpose , and the Apple Experience included both the descentof the fruit and the consumption of it , and Eve and Newton and Emma understood one another perfectlyin this particular of reality . Emma started . The Metropolitan boys , who , however bright they were , would be boys , now caused some steelyp247article of dress to clank , and she instantly quit the balcony , as if this unseemly noise would attract the crowd 's attention and bring everyone , including Eisenburg , to see what had happened . She stuttered like a quarry through the sightseers until she found an empty seat in front of Rembrandt 's famous frump , " The Noble Slav "  --  it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rembrandt , that made life in New York such hell for Emma  --  and there , upon the plum velours , she realized with surprise that Alfred Eisenburg 's had been the last familiar face she had seen before she had closed the door of her tomb . In September , it had been her custom to spend several hours of each day walking in a straight line , stopping only for traffic lights and outlaw taxicabs , in the hope that she would be tired enough to sleep at night . At five o'clock  --  and gradually it became more often four o'clock and then half past three  --  she would go into a bar , where , while she drank , she seemed to be reading the information offered by the Sun on " Where to Dine . " Actually she had ceased to dine long since ; every few days , with effort , she inserted thin wafers of food into her repelled mouth , flushing the frightful stuff down with enormous drafts of magical , purifying , fulfilling applejack diluted with tepid water from the tap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withheld the rain , as if to punish the whole city , she had started out from Ninetieth Street and had kept going down Madison and was thinking , as she passed the chancery of St. Patrick 's , that it must be nearly time and that she needed only top248turn east on Fiftieth Street to the New Weston , where the bar was cool , and dark to an almost absurd degree . And then she was hailed . She turned quickly , looking in all directions until she saw Eisenburg approaching , removing a gray pellet of gum from his mouth as he came . They were both remarkably shy and , at the time , she had thought they were so because this was the first time they had met since their brief and blameless flirtation . ( How curious it was that she could scrape off the accretions of the months that had followed and could remember how she had felt on that spring night  --  as trembling , as expectant , as altogether young as if they had sat together underneath a blooming apple tree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from something else , she thought that perhaps his had , too , and she connected his awkwardness on that Septemberday with a report she had had , embedded in a bulletin on everyone , from her sole communicant , since her retreat , with the Olympian world . This informant had run into Alfred at a party and had said that he was having a very bad time of it with a divorce , with poverty , with a tempest that had carried off his job , and , at last , with a psychoanalyst , whose fees he could not possibly afford . Perhaps the nightmare had been well under way when they had met beside the chancery . Without alcohol and without the company of other people , they had had to be shy or their suffering would have shown in all its humiliating dishabille . Would it be true still if they should inescapably meet this afternoon in an Early Flemish room ?  |p249Suddenly  , on this common level , in this state of socialdisplacement , Emma wished to hunt for Alfred and urgently tell him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it had been for her . But naturally she was not so naive , and she got up and went purposefully to look at two Holbeins . They pleased her , as Holbeins always did . The damage , though , was done , and she did not really see the pictures ; Eisenburg 's hypothetical suffering and her own real suffering blurred the clean lines and muddied the lucid colors . Between herself and the canvases swam the months of spreading , cancerous distrust , of anger that made her seasick , of grief that shook her like an influenza chill , of the physical afflictionsby which the poor victimized spirit sought vainly to wreck the arrogantly healthy flesh . Even that one glance at his face , seen from a distance through the lowing crowd , told her , now that she had repeated it to her mind 's eye , that his cheeks were drawn and his skin was gray ( no soap and water can ever clean away the grimy look of the sick at heart ) and his stance was tired . She wanted them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another in the most maudlin fashion over a lengthy succession of powerful drinks of whisky , to compare their illnesses , to marry their invalid souls for these few hours of painful communion , and to babble with rapture that they were at last , for a little while , no longer alone . Only thus , as sick people , could they marry . In any other terms , it would be a mesalliance , doomed to divorce from the start , for rubes and intel/lectuals must stick to their own class . If only it could take place  --  this honeymoon of the cripples , this nuptialconsummation of the abandoned  --  while drinking the delicious amber whisky in a joint with a juke box , a stout barkeep , and a handful of tottering derelicts ; if it could take place , would it be possible to prevent him from marring it all by talking of secondary matters ? That is , of art and neurosis , art and politics , art and science , art and religion ? Could he lay oil the fashions of the day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is , see the apple fall and not run madly to break the news to Newton and ask him what on earth it was all about ? Could he , for her sake ( for the sake of this pathetic rube all but weeping for her own pathos in the Metropolitan Museum ) , forget the whole dispute and , believing his eyes for a change , admit that the earth was flat ? It was useless for her now to try to see the paintings . She went , full of intentions , to the Van Eyck diptych and looked for a long time at the souls in Hell , kept there by the implacable , impartial , and genderless angel who stood upon its closing mouth . She looked , in renewed astonishment , at Jo Davidson 's pink , wrinkled , embalmedhead of Jules Bache , which sat , a trinket on a fluted pedestal , before a Flemish tapestry . But she was really conscious of nothing but her desire to leave the museum in the company of Alfred Eisenburg , her cousingermanin the territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hours before the **27;6879;TOOLONG next day was cooler , ruffled by a faint wind from the east . Miss Todd woke up at daybreak , feeling fresh and invigorated . The rest were still sleeping . She straightened her shawl and got up , sniffing the cool , tart spice in the air , the lingering smell of decaying shellfish . She strolled past the beach to the edge of the promontory . Down beyond the fringe of the cliffs the island spread into desert , but a desert which once , centuries ago , must have been fertile , and eons before that , presumably , had lain buried in the sea . Fossils lay scattered about : veins of coral , fine as lace ; ancient shellfish transformed into feathers of stone . There was an aroma of timelessness , a stillness richer than mere solitude . Tiny ponds shone in the sunrise , filled with rust-colored water . Not a bird was stirring , not even an insect . Suddenly she felt , without warning , a bit unwell  --  a fit of nausea welling up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dull , bleak weariness . She walked on . The ground was rising . The sand darkened to a dappled slate color . There was something ugly , amorphous , about these bulging ripples rising out of the desert ; they suggested an unimaginable past , the ravenous idiocy of the dinosaurs . She turned and started back . Suddenly the ground gave under her feet . She lost her balance and fell headlongon the hard , rolling gravel . She lay still for a minute , wondering what had happened . The smell of the earth , vaguely sulphurous , enclosed her like a vapor . She brushed the dust from her dress and looked around . Had someone called ? Was someone watching ? No . Nothing but emptiness.  |p25A  grim , mineral vacancy . She rose clumsily , clutching at the wisps of dry grass , and hurried back to the yellow beach . Salah was boiling his pot of rice when she returned . She mentioned nothing of her little excursion . Two of the men began their morning qasida , spreading their arms grandiloquently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mizmar  --  a fragile instrument , semi-transparent , made of an eagle 's feathers . Hassan started to sing . His muscles shone like an athlete 's , bright with the effort of song . Idris was wearing his skullcap , which was embroidered with tinsel and sequins . His cheeks ballooned as he piped away cheerfully . But Hassan 's face as he sang was distorted with anguish ; his great chest heaved with the weight of the qasida . " Is this a love song ? " said Miss Todd , leaning closer toward Ahmed . " No , no , " said Ahmed disparagingly . " It is only a light , wispy song from Ispahan . The songs from Egypt are sad . And the songs from Java are even sadder . These Persian songs are nothing at all  --  just little snippets about birds and flowers . " A green snake crept out of Ahmed 's shirt as he listened to the mizmar . " Good heavens , " cried Miss Todd . " Ahmed ! A snake ! " " It is my personal snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Of course it 's poisonous , " boasted Ahmed . " Wo n't it bite you ? " " It has bitten me three times , " said Ahmed proudly . " The first time I was very sick  --  so sick that I almost died . The second time I was quite sick . I lay in bed for two days . The third time I was a little upset for an hour or two . And now , of course , I am not afraid . " " How odd , " murmured Miss Todd . " I should think you 'd dislike the animal . " Ahmed grinned . " We are great friends ! We have forgivenp26each other . Iuslim , look at me ! " The snake peered at Ahmed with a blurred , drooping look . Ahmed plucked it out of his lap and kissed it affectionately on the snout . That afternoon a large sailing boat passed the island . The two Somalis rolled their eyes and sniffed the air , stirred by some fleeting intuition . Toward sunset they noticed two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent Hassan to climb the cliff and scan the shore on the other side . It was dusk when Hassan returned , creeping swiftly over the sand . His brown body moved like a lizard , almost invisible against the coppery beach . He explained . The sister ship had apparently been seized and now was anchored beyond the cape two miles away , three cable-lengths from the marauding vessel . Akbar and Salah made their plans , gesticulatingfiercely . Night shot down ; they all slipped back into their little houris and went skimming over the calm black water . The Gulelfa was only a blot , a hint of deeper shadow , until her masts rose sharply against the stars , the lateen yard triced close . Three silent figures stood on the deck as Miss Todd peered wearily from the houri ; she was lifted out , the pirogues were raised , the glint of danger shone in the darkness . They trimmed the sails and carefully hauled out the length of the cables . They heard two shots fired in the distance  --  from the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly . A ripple flew over the moonlit sea ; a land breeze was rising . " Allah be praised , " growled Ahmed . The sails were freed and billowed out , and the boat flowed silently from her anchorage . The distant land faded . The ocean began to surge . A rash and reckless thing to do , groaned Ahmed  --  setting off in the darkness , with the reefs abounding ! But the land breeze kept bearing them along in fine trim ; luck was with them , and they sped through the pungency of the night.  |p27Miss  Todd was sitting by Dr. Moss . " Look , " she whispered . " How happy they are ! " " They are savages , after all , Miss Todd , " moaned Dr. Moss . The wind began to growl . They were heading directly for Arabia . Toward midnight a great luxury liner crossed their bow . Every detail was clear and festive  --  the first-class passengersin their evening dress were strolling along the decks and stretched on their chairs . The strains of the dance-music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moss glanced at his watch . He turned to Miss Todd rather petulantly . " Do you have the time , Miss Todd , by any chance ? " Miss Todd smiled quizzically . " Does time exist here ? " " Precisely as everywhere else , " snapped Dr. Moss . " Time is ubiquitous , I 'm afraid . " Miss Todd peered toward Arabia . " I dare say . I dare say . " She added gently , " I can hardly believe it , though . It must be a different kind of time , do n't you think ? " The liner faded into the night . The Guleifa was alone again . A bit later , an hour after midnight it might have been , Miss Todd woke up again . The water hissed under the stern , the rigging squealed softly . The African boys lay naked beside her , curled up like wolfhounds . She detected the musk of their salty bodies  --  male and pungent , like raw hickory . Ahmed and Idris were sleeping too , side by side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the tiller sat old Akbar , his vulture face drenched in moonlight , looking like some terrible old patriarch steering his lonely vessel through the gulf . Her forehead burned . She opened her bag and reached for the aspirin . The ship gave a jolt ; the little jewel-case went spilling across the deck . She crawled forward on her knees , snatching clumsily at the scattered ornaments.  |p28Old  Akbar sat without moving , eyes closed like a blind man 's . Idris stirred softly , tightening his fist in his sleep . Miss Todd sat quite still , breathless with incredulity . Could this be real ? Was she really here ? She felt she was shawled in some antique secrecy , like an unborn child , crouching in this hot , expectant , impenetrable gloom . She lay down again . Now she saw only the sea and the stars . The wake pointed east , white and clear as a chain of beads. a ap29Dr . Moss woke up at sunrise , feeling weak and rheumatic . There was an ominous sense of oncoming heat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea , and the sea itself was calm , smooth as a sheet of lead , stirred here and there by a sudden ripple  --  a school of minnows , a drifting cat 's paw . The sails hung limp from the yard , the loosened sheet flapped listlessly . The rays grew fiery , the sea grew dazzling . The heat shot down like a shower of embers . Then everything changed . The east wind approached , and the sea was transformed into a glorious , foam-dappled blue . The sails billowed , and the boat cut swiftly through the leap of the waves . They passed a group of tall rocks  --  crags of bronze striped with maroon , with a tuft of snow-white beach at the base . Two skinny boys were fishing in a small black boat , the only sign of life in all this sun-stunned serenity . The far-off islandsfloated like fans over the water . On they sailed . The wind subsided . The Guleifa grew languid . Something in this reef-infested region suddenly startled Dr. Moss , some air of singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . History had passed this regionby , where masses of sea-fowl shrieked over the rocks , which rose like domes in the rosy light  --  some conelike , some thimble-shaped , some blunt and jagged . The clangor of seabirdsfilled the air , but it seemed to Dr. Moss not quite real , not wholly audible ; it seemed to hover just beyond the range of the ear . Clouds passed . The tints in the archipelago shifted fromp30blue to a sickly lavender . But the water itself hung clear as glass in the eerie calm . He could see the shrubs of coral passingunder the boat , precise and opulent . These were colors , this was a brilliance , he had never seen before . The whole scene suddenly commanded him : Look ! This is light , this is color ! This is the reality of air and water , this is the texture of the visible world ! Look again , look quickly , before it 's too late ! A thrill of expectancy passed through him . His uneasiness vanished . He borrowed a tattered jerd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They worked their way carefully through the treachery of the archipelago and presently rounded a spur-shaped peninsula . " No . Not here ! " called Akbar . The gloomy Egyptian steered the Gulei fa toward a barren island , which quivered in the heat waves like a great bronze helmet . They passed a group of sambouks , the little sailboats of the pearl-divers . Dr. Moss felt troubled . On every side the young divers , brown and naked as Adam , stood enthusiasticallywaving their futahs at them . Two little zarougs slid past  --  light , arrowing vessels , free of ballast . Inside them sat a group of Arabs , holding their guns . They passed the Guleifa , eying it truculently . " From Mocha , " said Akbar with a dejected air . The subtle-eyed Idris came up and squatted by Dr. Moss . " Are you thirsty , honorable sir ? " He held out a cup of water . " Thank you , " said Dr. Moss , drawing back an inch or two . Idris 's sloe eyes passed casually over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How many years do you have , sir ? " Dr. Moss hesitated . " What would you guess ? " " Ah ! " Idris grinned . " Thirty years , honorable sir . "  | " I am forty-four , " said the doctor crisply . Idris smiled gallantly . " Still very young ! Young enough to make love , Your Excellence . " He leaned closer , confidentially . " The elderly madame  --  is she your mother ? " The doctor blushed . " Not at all . I scarcely know her , as it happens . " " The two young ones  --  do you know them ? " " Hardly at all , " snapped Dr. Moss . Idris looked at him shrewdly . " You are alone ? No friends at all ? " " I have acquaintances , " said Dr. Moss . " Whom you love ? " " Whom I respect . " " But whom do you love ? " Dr. Moss glared at the Arab . Idris 's face shone with sweat . His eyes dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have my work , " said the doctor , scowling . " I have no time for the usual nonsense . " " Work ? " purred Idris . " I study the past . I am an archaeologist , " said the doctor sternly . Idris looked puzzled . " When we come to Kumra , " he whispered , " I will find you a lovely girl . Or a hairless boy , if you prefer . I am too old for you , I suppose ? " Dr. Moss got up and walked rapidly across the deck . His black , wrinkled coat flapped behind him in the rising wind . A heavy swell came up from the gulf . The monsoon was blowing , and a powerful current bore the Guleifa westward . They spent all afternoon tacking in the rough angry waters . Countless isles hovered like beetles on the darkening horizon . The wind grew stronger ; the men started to lower the mainsail . Hassan squealed . The half-lowered sail suddenly slid and trailed in the water as he slipped and fell on hisp32knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violent twist , smashed the lateen yard . The ship rolled and tossed . Akbar groaned , flinging his arms . There was nothing to do but run before the wind and hope for the best . The boat trembled as she sped into the uneasy twilight . The men were alert with a tension half joyous , half fearful . The water throbbed under them like a giant motor . Stars twinkled , the moon crept out . They slid through the arms of the night . Plumes of foam leaped through the air like flying fish . The Gulel fa flew along on firm swift wings , and Dr. Moss began to feel a new agitation in his blood  --  the thrill of the rising sea , tremendous and delicate . With the night came a heightened air of suspense . The fear of the hidden rocks began to creep over them . An hour passed . Hassan was keeping a close lookout at the masthead ; he was watching for the dangerous line of the reef . The tensiongrew curiously gripping . " Aya ! " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like an ancient threat , sendingback the muffled sound of their voices . The Gule'ifa rushed past , quick and light as a gull . There was a hint of enormous depth and intensity in the echoing waters . " Do you see anything , Hassan ? " " No . Nothing at all . " They were drifting with the currents . The swell increased and passed darkly over the far-off reefs without breaking . " Hassan ! Any sign of the reefs ? " " Not yet , Akbar . " Now it seemed they must drift helplessly over one hidden reef after another until they finally met the one shallow enough to destroy them . Salah and Idris were leaning over the water with boat-hooks , waiting for the vessel to strike a rock . Time passed . They drifted on . Now the tide was running against the wind , stirring up a choppy , irritable sea . Once there was a jar in the boat , a quick sharp shudder , and somewherethe sound of a brittle vibration . They got ready to jump into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , " sangp33Akbar . They floated on . The minutes passed in a black suspense . Now and then Dr. Moss imagined he could see a clump of coral protruding , writhing among the waves like a giant hydra . Suddenly they caught sight of the snow-white breakers rollingin the distance . The Egyptian was at the helm . Hassan cried , " Quick ! Quick ! " A wave broke directly under the stern . The Egyptian swung the helm sharply over . The ship lurched . The reef was fifty-odd yards away . Hassan 's eyes were burning as he lay in the bow , staring at the sea . The rest of the men were watching him feverishly . Then he cried , " Djoch ! Djoch ! " The helm was pulled over , and the sheet grew taut instantly . The Guleifa sped into an opening between two arcs of foam and entered the mild , protected waters . The men sank back with relief . Hassan 's teeth shone in a giant smile . " Well done ! " cried old Akbar . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatted lightheartedly as they dropped the anchor off the beach . " This is the place , " said Akbar solemnly . He pointed . " There lies Sabaya ! " The moon dimmed . All was still . The water lay glossy as tar . The Arabs were curling up in their djellabas , ready for sleep . " Good night , " cried young Idris , spreading his jerd for Dr. Moss . " And may Allah bless you in your sleep , honorable sir ! " Dr. Moss felt remarkably well . A sentiment of kinship welled up in him , a wave of esprit de corps , almost exuberance , such as he had never experienced . He got up noiselessly and strolled down the beach , scenting the fragrance of the night , feeling the cool soft sand give under his feet . He stripped off his tie and tucked it in his pocket ; then he knelt and pulled off his shoes and socks . The sand oozed through his toes . Ap34twinge of pleasure shot through him . He leaped in the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He squealed with pain and sank to the ground . A splinter of flint had pierced his skin ; he could see a dark bead of blood . He limped back to the crumbling fire , feeling lonely , dispirited . But as he lay near the fire , watching the embers die away and the sleeping bodies fade into the reef-stilled darkness , a new sensation came over him . The strange tension in his body gave way to a feeling of numbness . He felt as though he were being rubbed with camphor : his skin gently evaporating , his outer self drifting into the night . His heart froze . Something stirred by the water 's edge : a shaggy , half-human silhouette , like a gorilla 's . It crouched on the glossy sand , jaw thrust forward , eyes burning . The whole body was poised in a kind of horrible expectancy . The doctor 's eyes began to water ; a twinge of hysteria dug at his spine . But , as he stared , the shape dissolved . It faded like steam into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was nothing but sand , sky , and water.  |p35The  lateen yard was repaired the following morning , and they sailed through the mist down the jagged coast toward Sabaya . They slid through a narrow isthmus between two towering islands . Great rocks caught the waves like a giant 's fists ; the spume unfurled , the stone was alive with a coruscating silver . The mist thinned , the veil parted , and then quite suddenly , like some illumination from the pit of the world , an explosion of sunlight flooded the coast . The rocks grew marbled . A torrent of colors flowed over the sea . Dr. Moss caught his breath , stunned by all this magnificence . Then the light grew hard , and the splendor died into bleakness . At noon they passed a group of pearl-divers ' boats . Ahmed explained . These vessels would anchor off the pearl banks for months at a time , fed by diminutive supply ships from the mainland . In the heat of summer , when the sharks had drifted to deeper waters , the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosening the shells and round containers to carry them up . Each of the divers had a stone-weighted rope tied to his toe : this would help draw him down , and when he tugged at the end after a minute or so would rapidly draw him up again . The shells were opened on deck ; a nauseating stench spread from the boats . One shell in a hundred , said Ahmed , bore a tiny white pearl . Sabaya loomed at the end of a long still bay . They stole up and dropped the anchor in an uneasy swell . Forty yards ofp36cable were laid out before the anchor touched bottom . The heat was appalling . Akbar whistled . " A bad town ! " He sent the houri with Hassan and Ahmed to buy food and consult with the local authorities . They waited two hours ; no sign of the houri . Dusk fell , and Dr. Moss sat on deck , nursinghis foot . Here and there a yellow light was beginning to twinkle , furtive , inimical among the iron-gray walls . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly ? The anniversaryof a local saint ? The town spilled its odor across the bay  --  an odor of ailing humanity , breathed out of hot , crowded cellars . Salah served dinner . A boiled fish was set before Dr. Moss , pink as a lobster , with eyes protruding like china beads . " I caught it myself , Your Excellence ! " said Idris , sidling up with a fig in his mouth . Dr. Moss caught the scent of the Arab 's body , fresh with the salt of the sea . " Do you eat fish in America ? " inquired Idris . Dr. Moss nodded . " Occasionally . " " You eat pork ? " said Idris , suspicious . " Not very often , " said the doctor curtly . " Dates and honey , perhaps ? " " Just a bit . Now and then . " " Almond tarts ? Maize biscuits ? " " From time to time . " The doctor sighed . Idris ran his fingers across his nipples . " What do you feed your camels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I dare say , " said the doctor , drawing a bone from his mouth . Idris looked piqued . He cocked his head toward the early stars . " You are making fun of me . " He pouted . " You are treatingme like a woman ! " He rose and walked sulkily off into the darkness . Ahmed and Hassan returned in the morning and rowed the party ashore . Sabaya lay blazing in the ruddy light , thep37red cliffs behind it and the tapering little forts , white as tusks against the harrowing blue . The harbor was alive with wooden houris and sambouks . Bales of sugar , rice , sesame lay piled on the shore . The boats and bales , even the fishing nets , had an old Phoenician look about them , cast at random along the crescent of sand . Dr. Moss stepped ashore and entered the beehive of Sabaya . Everything radiated a kind of seething fertility . The gourds and limes shone like illuminated bulbs . The copper pans and platters vibrated with light , like cymbals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smells of camels , dates , donkeys , human flesh , and perfume , and the leathery scent of excrement down in the shadows . There was an air of luminous proliferation , as though in the very aridity of the land the sun had created its own abandon . Arches and latticework cast shadows sharp and delicate as an etching . The facial shadows were so black that Idris 's eyes lay hidden in a mask , and his mouth and nostrils seemed painted with kohl . They walked past the mosque and came to an open field where a great black stone lay on the edge of the wadi . Idris , who had been in Sabaya before , explained that the stone was sacred , venerated by the natives . It looked like a meteorite which must have fallen centuries ago , for it was pock-marked by the sands and polished by an infinite number of human hands . Life even here , it seemed to say , bears a human patina . Dr. Moss caught sight of an inscription near the base of the rock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decipherable . He took out his notebook and scrupulously copied the words . They spoke of an invasion by the Ethiopians , who had sacked the town and killed the king , and then ten years later had been driven back into the sea . In the very slant of the lettering , the sinuous pattern of curves and dashes , still lingered the glint of ancient hatreds . Idris was sitting beside him with dusty eyelashes . " The Ethiopians have an evil , many-faced god , " he said bitterly  | " Every god appears wicked to other people , " observed the doctor . " You too have a god ? " " All men have a god , Idris . " " A clever god ? " said Idris , squinting . " Our God is gentle and forgiving , " said Dr. Moss somewhatthinly . " A god must be hard and cruel , I think , " cried Idris in his limpid way . The doctor narrowed his eyes . " Our God is  --  Love . " " Love ! " Idris 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion , sir ! " " Not sexual love , " hinted the doctor . " Love for mankind , my boy . " " I have loved men sometimes , " confessed Idris , blushing faintly and spreading his fingers . " But it is a weakness , honorablesir ! " He crouched by the rock , closed his eyes , and told the doctorabout Mohammed : how he was painlessly borne by his mother Amina , already neatly circumcised , with little rings of kohl painted around his eyes . . . . " He was a great man . A holy man , " breathed Idris , torn by emotion . Pearls of sweat were rolling over the doctor 's eyes . The scene grew blurred . He leaned back , faint and breathless with the heat . His foot was throbbing ; a twinge of fever rose in his temples . He drew out his handkerchief and spread it across his skull . Then he drew off his sun-glasses , wiped them carefully , and put them on again . As he brushed his cheeks he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somethingsickening in the sandy texture , as though the skin were turning into a hide . And suddenly everything within him seemed on the point of disintegrating . The mosque , the marketplace , the meteorite , the Ethiopian invasion , the birth of Mohammed  --  a vicious , demoniac quality permeated them all . His sun-glasses fell from his nose and slid to the sand . Forp39the first time in his life he experienced doubt on the scale of terror . He glanced at Idris , who was staring at him with speculative eyes . " Come , " he gasped , and clutched at the rock , which burned his palm like coal . Idris helped him to his feet , and they walked in silence back to the harbor.  |p40Above  the harbor lay a grove of tamarisks , where some beduin had pitched their tents . The young ones were drawing water out of a well while the elders sat in the shade for a pull at their hookahs . A goat was grazing nearby , her udders huge and laden , ears dangling with silver talismans ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew of the Guleifa settled down for the evening . Salah was getting ready to cook a feast ; Hassan had shot a gazelle up in the hills . Ahmed cast his djellaba on the ground , and Sylvia sat down beside Miss Todd . Dusk was settling ; a pastoral calm floated by . A bell was tinkling on the nannygoat , and the air was full of a heathery scent . Sylvia closed her eyes . It might have been an evening in Devonshire , almost . " All this , my dear "  --  Miss Todd sighed  --  " will seem very unreal to you back in England . " Sylvia watched Idris holding a tiny mirror and carefully painting his eyes , flicking his long blue fingers like a ballerina . Hassan was squatting beside the fire , biting his nails . Ahmed leaned over intently , plucking lice from the seams of a blanket . The water was bubbling lazily in the pot . One of the nomads came up and started to sing . Everyone listened , breathless . Idris held his fingers poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old man 's voice was blurred and eerie , vaguely like an oboe . The song drifted into the boughs , joining the great blue spaciousness . The old bedu turned and gazed at Sylvia with withered eyes . His face was pitted and wrinkled , so yellow it seemed hep41must be dead . Even the whites of his eyes and his teeth were a saffron yellow . The hair on his chest waved softly , like thistledown . He was ugly and hard as flint . But a magical youthfulnessstill clung to him . He looked at Sylvia with a cold deep glare , pitiless as a cobra 's , seeing everything , feeling nothing  --  atleast nothing for which there was a word . " Sing , Idris ! " cried Hassan . Idris started to sing . The bedu 's song had been of the land , of the deserts crossed by the caravans . It had told , explained Miss Todd , of the evanescence of things , of the pangs of love , of the merciless slaughter of rival tribes . But Idris 's song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It told of blossomingflowers and the stirring of distant boughs , of silence and starlight , of remote , unappeasable gods . Wonderful scents were rising from Salah 's gazelle . Mr. Maxwelland Dr. Moss had joined Miss Todd under the tamarisk . They spoke in low , casual voices . It was like a holiday picnic . Sylvia lapsed into a momentary daydream . The scene grew transformed ; Miss Todd loomed like some antique queen over the tattered landscape , weaving the air of vagrancy into a stern , controllable pattern . Dr. Moss crouched mysteriouslyover his notes , like an alchemist , scrawling busily with his pencil . Mr. Maxwell , still wet from his swim , was drawing patterns in the dust with a broken twig ; he looked like some Scandinavian voyager , sketching a crude , primitive map . The old bedu returned , bearing a bowl of coffee mixed with ginger . He bowed to Miss Todd with extreme ornateness and gave a flowery little speech . Miss Todd bowed in return , rather stiffly . " What did he say , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual kind of thing . That he is the descendant of the saint Sa'id bin Isa Amudi , who is buried near Hajarain , and to whose grave the pilgrims pay a visit for a four-day feast in the month of Rajab , and so on . " Miss Todd seemed out ofp42sorts , thought Sylvia . Her face was flushed ; was she feeling ill ? The day was narrowing into a bank of sulphurous blue , and on the other side of the hill it was already turning to a bat-wing gray . Hassan kept tossing thorny twigs on the blaze . The gazelle turned slowly on the spit , a sizzling bronze . Salah was pouring a sauce over the rice . Sylvia felt drowsy , strangely lulled . All this soft , calm activity ; all this patient , wordless preoccupation  --  it made her feel that she had been here for years instead of hours . It was a feeling of huge , unbreakable peace , so intense that all thought of the outer world grew unconvincing . Waves of warm , heavy indifference lapped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I am Sylvia Howard . " She added tensely , " I have come from Bombay . I am on my way to London . " But the words remained meaningless . Sylvia Howard . . . Bombay . . . London . . . They floated away like gusts of smoke . " I am here ! " she whispered . " I am in Arabia ! " The words crackled and broke , like flying embers . Miss Todd 's voice entered her consciousness . " There , my dear . Wake up . You must eat . " Salah came and set his gazelle in front of them . It was stuffed with dates and honey , wreathed in garlands of steam . The roasted skin , crisp and burnished , cast a delicious fragranceinto the firelit air . Sylvia took a bite . The meat was tender but vaguely disgusting like stale mackerel , a little . But the Arabs belched greedily ; their eyes grew glassy . Their lips shone with grease , and they sank back happily on the warm blue dust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees , still and drowsy . There was a cry from the distant rocks . " Listen , " hissed Idris . " A hyena ! " " Are there hyenas here ? " said Sylvia anxiously . " This is a ghost hyena , " said Idris , with mysterious eyes . Sylvia grew pensive . " I see . Are there many ghosts in Arabia ? " " Certainly , " said Idris cuttingly . " Why should n't there be ? "  | " I just wondered , " said Sylvia . " Have you never seen an Arabian ghost , mademoiselle ? " " Not yet , I 'm afraid . " Sylvia sighed . Idris flicked a mosquito from his eyelashes . " Someday I 'll show you a ghost . " His gaze grew playful , indulgent . " What kind of ghost would you like to see ? " " Oh , just a harmless little ghost , " pleaded Sylvia . " A rabbit ghost , perhaps ? Or a moon ghost ? " " What is a moon ghost , Idris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are sun ghosts and star ghosts and moon ghosts , " explained Idris , crooking his forefinger didactically . " And sea ghosts and wind ghosts . Also mountain ghosts and sand ghosts . Mountain ghosts are evil and bloodthirsty . Sand ghosts are lonely and sad . Wind ghosts are playful , naughty . Sea ghosts are nervous , irritable . Sun ghosts are very rare ; they appear only to the dying . Moon phantoms are sweet and gentle . Sometimes they sing , like Persian nightingales . Some night , mademoiselle , we will look for a moon ghost ! " Sylvia was troubled by dreams in the middle of the night . The feast lay heavy within her ; strange visions frolicked across her brain . She found herself floating in a canoe on a palmedgedcanal , moving slowly toward a passage between two cliffs . A procession of white-robed men stood along the shore , watching her intently . The wind caught her clothes and carriedthem off ; she suddenly realized that she was naked . A stab of horror shot through her . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long black arm reached out of the sky  --  the sleeve like a minister 's , the hand like a gorilla 's . She forced herself awake with sudden desperation . Everythinglooked still and dead around her . She rose and tiptoed past the sleeping Arabs down to the beach . The moon shone on the ruddy sand , the waves were white and pearly.  |p44She  forced herself , in this strange new fear , to think of England . But England seemed infinitely remote , quaint and brittle as a painted fan . She closed her eyes as she sat on the sand and tried to conjure up the landscapes of Devon  --  the rolling moors , the parks with their streams and the red deer grazing , the badminton court behind the willows , the scones and strawberriesserved for tea , the click of the croquet ball on Miss Weatherill 's mallet . Girls passed over the lawn in their pale blue dresses ; elderly aunts with enormous hats sat stiff under their parasols . . . . It was a vignette from a long-lost album , musty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the floating corpses , the crouching saddhus . These seemed real enough to her ; but they loomed in a world of trivialities , a succession of tinkling little ceremonies . She opened her eyes and stared at the gulf . The moon , sickle-thin , hung like an emblem over the harbor . A man was squatting on the beach some fifty yards away . He crouched by the edge of the water , washing his arms and legs with sand , then his ears and face and mouth with salt water . He was black and shiny , muscular as a serpent . He rose slowly and stood facing her for a moment , his face upraised , his arms outspread . His white futah lay on the ground beside him . He wore nothing at all , and as he stood there silhouetted against the gleam of the rippled sea he looked to Sylvia like something ancient and terrifying  --  like Man emergingfrom the primordial emptiness , with the indescribable majestyof manhood about him . He flung the sand from his arms and legs with a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first hint of light was already lurking , and stole silently back through the trees and vanished from sight.  |p45The  sailors sat in a ring around the fire , passing the hashish pipe . The moon was low . The night belonged to the Arabs . Akbar 's eyes were glittering . " What do you see in the stars , Idris ? " ' Idris grinned . " Danger ! Bloodshed ! " Salah chortled . " Idris is hiding something . Tell us the truth now , Idris . " " I see two men on a camel , " chanted Idris . " Carrying basketsof incense down toward the harbor . " " Beduin or Unbelievers ? " " Pale men with golden hair . They are bearing shields marked with a cross . " " No , no , Idris . Control your fancy . What do you see ? " said Akbar , scowling . Idris gazed thoughtfully at the Big Dipper . " Nothing , " he said in a strange thin voice . A listless silence fell over the men . Old Akbar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I feel a sadness in my blood , " said Idris , petulant . " Come , " said Hassan . " Let 's go . " He seized Idris 's hand . The two young men rose and wandered through the heatdown to the shore . They cast their robes on the sand andstepped into the shallow water . Idris felt the wind ripplingacross his body as he waded along the edge of the sea . A greatemptiness gnawed at his heart . The world of the flesh ceasedto matter . Hassan took him by the forefinger and drew him into thep46water . They lay floating , arm in arm , gazing up at the stars . " What is the matter , Idris ? " Idris said nothing . " Idris ! Tell me ! Did you see something evil in the stars ? " Still Idris said nothing . Hassan sneered . " Are you afraid , Idris ? " " These are evil waters , Hassan ! " " You are afraid , " growled Hassan contemptuously and tugged at Idris 's arm , drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a handful of water shot into his windpipe . He gurgled , gripping Hassan fiercely by the throat . There was a quick little struggle . Hassan swung with his fist ; Idris bit him savagely in the forearm . Hassan lifted him out of the water and hurled him through the air . Idris fell and struck his temple against a rock . For a moment he lay senseless , half floating in the tide . Hassan rushed up to him . " Idris ! Are you dead ? " Idris saw the world moving through ring after ring of darkness , then entering a sphere of blinding light , zigzagged with veins of fiery red . He opened his eyes and began to cough . Hassan was murmuring , " Forgive me , Idris . " He clasped Idris in his arms and carried him tenderly up onto the sand . There he laid him down gently , stroking his forehead . " Are you well now , Idris ? " " Yes , " said Idris hoarsely , and a clutching happiness seized him as he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid eyes filled with tears.  --  Idris , forgive me ! " " I forgive you , Hassan . " Idris woke up an hour later . The fire among the tamarisks had crumbled . All the men were asleep ; only Hassan , beside him , was still awake , tugging persistently at Idris 's arms . " Wake up , Idris ! " " What has happened ? "  | " Nothing has happened . It is late ! " A powerful silence filled the night , stripping it of humancontent . Even the sound of the little waves had a flat , lifelesstone . Idris felt a twinge of pain in the side of his head . " Remember your promise , " murmured Hassan . " What promise ? " " The bracelet ! " Idris shook his head wearily . " Abdullillah says it is worth  --  " " Abdullillah is a viper . " " A thousand rupees ! " " Abdullillah is a toad . " There was a moment 's silence . " It was a promise , " growled Hassan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look . They 're sleeping ! " " Oh , Hassan . " " You 're a coward ! A kumarra  --  " " Be careful , Hassan . " " You 're a woman . With a woman 's timidity ! " Idris listened to the sound of the waves . His heart rapped unevenly . He glanced at Hassan , whose hair clung , wild and curly , to his forehead , like a bullock 's . Idris felt himself seized by something beyond his control . He rose and crept across the beach without a word , watching his shadow as it kept ( lodging beyond the reach of the crisp white moonlight . He climbed over the rocks and stood for a moment under the tamarisks . He had cut his toe on a shell ; the blood oozed forth , warm and painless . Even the pain in his temple had died away . His body felt numb , caught in a surge of inescapable terror . An eerie lightness carried him on . He felt himself moving among the sleepers , noiseless as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by the throat . He saw the girl asleep in the snow-white djellaba , and beside her the old woman , long and dark as a fallen branch . Her bag lay beside her , the buckle gleaming . The two men lay to the left of them , half lost in shadow . Idris crawled on all fours , feeling the softp48warm dust under his palms . He drew close to the sleepers ; a thread of nausea passed through him  --  not guilt , not fear , merely a sickening sense of compulsion . A slant of moonlight hung over the blond man 's face ; it looked beautiful , heroic , inscrutable to Idris . Something stirred behind a tree trunk . An animal wailed in the distance  --  the ghost hyena , could it be ? Idris paused , fixing his eyes on the circle of slumbering Arabs . He crept closer . Now he was crouching beside the bald littleman in black , the one whom Hassan suspected of being an ogre . Idris was sweating with suspense . A ring of dryness tingledin his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wormed his way past the little man , clinging to the patches of shadow . Now he was kneeling two feet from the old woman 's head . He hesitated ; a bitter taste , like dirty brass , clung to the roof of his mouth . His fist tightened . Was she stirring ? Or was it the bald little man ? His lips were moving . Was he awake ? No . He was snoring peacefully . Idris reached down gingerly ; his fingers crawled over the dust until they were three inches from the shining buckle . But then something happened to Idris . He sat paralyzed . His hand was frozen . One tiny gesture and the precious jewelswould be his . But he could not do it . His heart was seething like a beehive . He waited helplessly , hoping that the bracelet might leap out of the bag into his palm . But nothing happened . It was no use . The elderly sir had bewitched him . Or perhaps some benevolent sprite was protectingthe elderly madame . He crept back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , panting violently . The leaves overhead , scarcely stirring , were silhouetted against the sky , which hung unnaturallyradiant , intense . He sensed a new hostility in the gaze of the stars . One leaf was shaped like a glove . Another looked like a crab  --  or perhaps it was several leaves . The foliagewas infested with a kind of crawling malignance . He could hear the waves licking away at the beach below him . He rose and hurried back to the shore.  |p49Hassan  was lying on the sand . He smiled at Idris . " Did you do it ? " Idris blushed . " The elderly sir was awake . " " Did he see you ? " " Yes ! " Hassan 's teeth flashed angrily . " Did you speak to him , Idris ? " " No . " " Did you touch him ? " " No ! " " Why not ? " " He is ugly , Hassan . I am frightened of him ! " Hassan seized the boy 's wrist . " He will pay you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . Then we divide it . " Hassan kept staring tensely into Idris 's eyes . " Not now , " pleaded Idris . " Tomorrow ! I promise ! " Hassan 's eyes were bright with hashish . His chest heavedwith excitement . He brushed Idris 's cheek impatiently  --  halfa caress , half a slap . " Yes ! Now ! Hurry up ! " Idris turned away miserably . A dark weight pressed on his brain . He could not rid himself of the subtle , accumulating malaise which obsessed him  --  something which tugged at his senses , drawing him toward a hidden act of violence . " No , no , " he kept pleading . " Be patient , Hassan . " Hassan shrugged his great shoulders and lay down on his back , trailing his fingers listlessly in the sand . He closed his eyes and started to snore . Idris leaned over and kissed him on the eyelids , then stole back to the heap of ashes and lay down noiselessly beside Ahmed.  |p50Morning  came ; the four travelers were still asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoulder . Some townsmen had come to be cured by " the scholarly madame from the sea . " He set a cup of black tea on the ground beside her . A crystal exhilaration filled the air . The wavelike clang of the bells rose from the town below . Miss Todd peered through the trees . Sabaya lay barren in the sun , white as a heap of sun-bleached bones washed by the sea . Tiny houses clustered along the slope beyond the shore , each built on the edge of the one below ; each roof serving as a terrace and a poultry-yard for the house above ; so that the village looked like an enormous scramble of stairs , littered with chickens and cats and punctuated by the salmon-pink needle of the minaret . Beyond Sabaya rose the hills . On the edge of the hills rose the castle . Beyond the castle there was nothing but a succession of ridges , rust-colored and empty , vibrating in the sunlight . The sick and deformed had gathered in the tamarisk grove . There were twenty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the narrow path from the harbor . Miss Todd sat down on a rock with her leather kit , Ahmed beside her . One by one the lame and the blind and the ulcerous wandered up , humbly but shamelessly displayingtheir ailments . Strange wounds , unidentifiable diseases , not to be found in the medical books : one had a serpent in his brain , one had a stone lodged in his backbone . Ants inp51the kneecap , water in the toes , a tiny fish trapped in the testes . One child , a beautiful girl with silver anklets , showed a torso covered with great blue stains . Miss Todd applied antiphlogistine , eye lotion , iodine . She cut a bubo or two , administered quinine and penicillin . The procession grew , gathering pathos and resonance . There was little , almost nothing to be done for most of them . They lay sweltering in the dust , ranged in the fringe of shadow under the trees , shifting their ravaged bodies as the sun moved westward . One man had a terrible wound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One woman was legless and armless , borne in the arms of her sons . Another was close to death with elephantiasis . Some looked like skeletons , hollow-eyed grandmothers and children . They all gazed at Miss Todd with reverent , imploring eyes . Finally the ointments gave out . By noon she was close to exhaustion . Salah brought her a plate of rice and chicken livers , sprinkledwith raisins . She sat under an umbrella on the beach , cooled by a breeze from the gulf , and watched Idris dive into the waves with his spear . Ahmed was kneeling on the ground in front of her , massaging her feet and ankles . " Your bones are weary , venerable madame ! " " I am old , Ahmed . Too old for Arabia . " " No ! " cried Ahmed , solicitous . " Arabia will give you back your youth ! " Miss Todd felt disconcerted , loaded with some ill-defined regret . " You really think so , Ahmed ? " Ahmed looked at her sweetly . His strong brown fingers rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? So far and lonely ? " " I am never homesick , " said Miss Todd , folding her hands . " You carry your home with you , perhaps , " said Ahmed decorously . She looked at him with a new curiosity . It was the most intense , the most expressive face she had ever seen . But an expressiveness , an intensity veiled by a cool , impersonal grav/ity . He felt her gaze and lowered his eyes . He was murmuring to himself . " Someday I shall visit England , madame . " " You wo n't be happy there , Ahmed . " Ahmed looked troubled . " Will they put me in jail ? " " No , it is n't that , Ahmed . " " Will they scorn me ? " His eyes flashed . " You belong to Arabia , " said Miss Todd . Idris came darting out of the waves , his curls flecked with foam . He thrust his spear into the sand and squatted beside Miss Todd , panting merrily . " What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old fish , " said Idris , rolling his eyes . " Will you sell them ? " Idris simpered , tilting his head . " No one buys fish in Sa-baya ! " " Will you give them away ? " " No one eats fish in Sabaya , madame . They all hate fish . " " Will you eat them yourself then , Idris ? " " No , no , " said Idris . " I kill them for pleasure . I stab them "  --  he made a vicious thrust with his fist  --  " and send their spirits to join the clouds ! " She felt a strange lambent quality in Idris , warm yet remote . A thread of water was trickling over his cheek and down his shoulder . The full young lips and long lashes cast slate-blue shadows across his skin . He looked gentle as a dove , but a glint of wickedness played in his eyes . He was always gay , always smiling , hoping for fresh calamities . " You are always happy , are n't you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Because the Messenger of God has smiled on me . He has given me beauty and strength , madame . " He jumped up gleefully and skipped away , disappearing behind the rocks . Ahmed shook his head and murmured , " He is a squirrelish fellow , I 'm afraid . " He leaned forward and whispered , " When we reach Mukalla will you leave us , madame ? "  | " You can come to Aden if you wish , I suppose . " " Idris and I ? " Ahmed smiled wistfully . " Yes . We will followyou to Aden . You will protect us , madame ? " " Ahmed ! How on earth can I protect you ? " " You have power , venerable madame . You can conquer the demons ! " That evening , outside the tamarisk grove , the men of Sabayastarted singing . It was a song of gratitude , of beatification . Miss Todd had become a deity . Her gifts were saintly , beneficent . Akbar looked solemn as he sat listening behind a bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A small child brought a pot filled with wilted flowers . Two donkeyswere led through the grove , loaded with baskets of dates . Someone set a bowl of wild mountain honey before Miss Todd . She dipped a spoon , a bit hesitantly , in the glassy gold ; it had a flavor of legend  --  opaque and biblical , incrediblysweet . Finally the ceremonial singers and donkeys departed . The lamps of Sabaya gleamed in the dusk . A group of elders came strolling up the path . There was something ominous , Miss Todd observed , in their tread and demeanor . They strode in silence up to Akbar , and their spokesman started murmuring , raising his fingers and castinga low , hard glance toward Miss Todd . " What do they want , Ahmed ? " " They are suspicious , madame . " Ahmed frowned . " They think you are trying to plant an evil cult among the people . " " What nonsense , Ahmed ! " Ahmed looked miserable . " They think you are a witch , I think , madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drooping tamarisks . The harangues began . First one sidep54spoke and then another . A tall man in a red kufiya got up and raised his hand . " What have we to gain by disturbing them ? " he argued in sonorous tones . " If their cures are sound , let us be grateful . If their cures are false , let us be tolerant . " A stout little man with a sharp , vituperative mouth cried out , " When has tolerance become a virtue , Ali al-Baissa ? What have we to gain by helping our enemies ? " " How do we know they are our enemies ? " said the man in the red kufiya . " Can we be sure they are not ? " snapped the pudgy one . " Is it wise to take chances , Ali al-Baissa ? Better kill fifty friends than spare one enemy and then be destroyed by him ! " " This town , " pleaded the tall thin man , " has never been inhospitable to helpless voyagers . " " These are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " We live in a changing world , " said the tall man halfheartedly . " The curse of Allah be on them ! " cried the stout one , shaking his fist . The conference continued . The elders sat in a darkening semicircle , ugly men with huge mouths and black , crafty , close-set eyes . They were obviously enjoying themselves . Their hookahs made an agreeable bubbling noise . A feeling of in. finite leisure , interminable patience , hung about them . Miss Todd called Ahmed over . " What do they want , exactly ? Would a bit of bakshish help , do you suppose ? " Ahmed tried to look casual . " Two of the men think you are spies . Three of the men think you are ogres . One is n't sure . One does n't care . Only one has faith in your goodness , venerable madame . " An elder approached Ahmed with a goblet of yellowish tea and whispered in his ear , peering sidelong at Miss Todd . Ahmed looked mortified . He beckoned and spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . " The sayyidhas decided on a test . You and the elderly sir will oblig/ingly drink this tea , madame . If you are spies or djinns , your skin will turn black . " He stroked his beard and added affably , " If you are not djinns you will stay white , naturally . " " You 're sure it is tea ? " inquired Miss Todd . " Oh , more or less . " Salah coughed absently . " Please tell the sayyid , Salah , that we will drink his wretched tea if he sips it first . After all , how can we know that it is n't poison ? " Salah bowed . " Very sensible , madame . " He waddled over to the sayyid . There was a whispered , slightly uncomfortable consultation . The sayyid raised the goblet , wrinkled his nose and squinted , and took a gingerly sip of the amber liquid . He put it down and glared at Miss Todd with an embittered air . Salah returned with the glass and passed it first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grimly . Miss Todd experienced a fleeting doubt regarding the nature of the beverage . She swallowed it quickly and beamed with determinationat the assembled elders . The stout little man stared at her hopefully , waiting for her face to change color . Another of the elders , a spry old dandy in a lilac turban , flung up his hands . He expostulated with the meek , hesitant sayyid . He was gradually working himself into a frenzy of xenophobia . Suddenly he rose and strode over and spat in the doctor 's face . Dr. Moss leaped back , stiff with panic . Ahmed jumped between them and waved his hands . The man in the red kufiya raised his eyes apologetically . The sayyid stepped forward , spreading his arms , as though to demonstrate his authority . Miss Todd sensed a curious unreality in all this turmoil . Ahmed strode up with a downcast air and relayed the final decision of the village elders . " They are still suspicious , worthy madame . They wo n't listen to reason , I 'm afraid . They want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We can not afford large sums , " said Miss Todd crisply . " And the idea of a hostage is outrageous . "  | " Just one little hostage , " hinted Ahmed . Miss Todd pursed her lips . " For example ? " " The elderly sir , perhaps , do you think ? " Miss Todd bridled . " Preposterous , Ahmed . " " He looks like a snake-djinn to the sayyid , " quavered Ahmedunhappily . Miss Todd suddenly felt quite weak . The landscape began to tremble ; words , faces , trees , Sabaya , the whole labyrinth of mutual suspicions , all went spinning around in a whirlpool . She hardly noticed the coming of dusk , the dying of the heat , the departure of the elders . Their voices faded away like waves on a cliff . She sank to the ground under the tamariskand sipped at the tea which Salah brought her . The pointed leaves above her stirred in a slow , feathery pattern . From the distance came the voice of a nightingale.  |p57At  nightfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sayyid . The elders had arrived at a decision : the four faranchiswere to spend the night in the castle . They rode up the hill with the nacouda in front , and behind them two bowlegged soldiers in yellow kaftans . The castle rose from the top of the hill , blunt , medieval . Four broken turrets clung to the four uneven corners , and a moon oozed out of the roof like a great silver bubble . Black goats were wandering across the white-graveled slopes . They turned and grinned at the procession with their sly green eyes . Three men came riding through the gate on ivory-haired donkeys . The nacouda introduced them as the lord of the fortress and his nephews  --  little square-set aborigines with brutish , embryonic faces , quite unlike the long regular features of the typical Arab . They peered blankly at Miss Todd . Ahmed stepped forward and explained ; they had come to spend the night , he said politely . They needed food  --  dates and eggs , a bit of rice , perhaps  --  and a place to sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lord of the fortress listened craftily . Then he muttered something in a crude outlandish accent which escaped Miss Todd . She realized bleakly that they were half guests , half prisoners . They were led into the courtyard and through a series of passages and up a cinder-strewn stairway to their rooms . One of the nephews , sullen-eyed , led her through a tangle of corridors and flung open a door . Night had fallen . A tiny hag in a plum-blue barracan dipped through a cur/tain , set a lamp on the floor , whispered tremulously , " Marhaba ! " and vanished . Miss Todd lay down on her bed , faint with an ominous fatigue . The room was gaunt and dingy , but there was a spectral dignity about it , as though for centuries no thoughts had penetratedthere except the thoughts of the dead . She watched the nervous arabesque of the lamplight on the wall . The flame died all of a sudden , as though someone had blown it out . But the pattern of light kept stirring gently , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of obliteration , began to creep through Miss Todd . She lay on the bed and stared through the window , plucking the familiar stars out of the night . She carefully recited their names in Latin , one after the other , struggling to cling to the banks of her Western habits of thought . But the drift tugged irresistibly ; her nerves grew supine and passive ; she felt herself carried away on a stream of feeling more reckless , more elusive . New apprehensions , ambiguous reveries crept over her as she lay there . She grew aware of some sly , unsuspected pattern in the flow of events . One more episode , one further crisis , and the shape of the pattern would lie apparent . She gazed at the past , phase upon phase of it , with a wistful detachment . Surrey , Cheltenham , Girton ; ivied walls , drizzling hockey fields . Cyprus , Singapore , Calcutta  --  harbors drenched with humanity . But through it all , untouched , unmodified , moved the obstinate entity of her own routine  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from passion . She buried her face in the cashmere coverlet ; her eyes grew blinded with pain . But peace returned . Distant footsteps echoed across the crumbling terrace . There was a spice in the room , fresh and pungent , like rosemary . The light stirred on the uneven textureof the wall . There was a heightening in the atmosphere . Yes . The room was haunted . She felt sure of it now . But by whom ? Not by anything alien , not by a Moslem presence , but by something fragile and intimate and pleading.  |p59She  rose and tiptoed out onto the terrace , into the world of the planets . There was a whisper just behind her . " Are we prisoners , do you suppose , Miss Todd ? " It was Dr. Moss . He stood in the shade of the turret , almost invisible . " Not in any disagreeable way , I should n't think , " said Miss Todd with a sigh . She sat down on the broken battlement , faintly dizzy . Dr. Moss stood close beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you trust these people , Miss Todd ? " Miss Todd felt rather devious . " There is no occasion to trust anyone really , at this point , is there ? " Dr. Moss looked at her acidly , detecting a slur . " I must tell you quite frankly , Miss Todd , " he said curtly , clearing his throat , " I have a peculiar feeling about these people . A distinctlyunpleasant intuition . " " Yes ? " She placed two fingers on her chin . " Do n't you feel something rather odd in the air ? " She smiled thoughtfully . " Are you afraid ? " Dr. Moss gazed at her wildly . " Good heavens ! Are n't you ? " " Not in the least , my dear Doctor . " His eyes clung to her like a child 's . " Ah . Well , no doubt you are right , " he muttered dejectedly . She felt maternal quite suddenly toward the little professor  --  abit worried , a bit bored , but almost affectionate . The light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a trembling in his jaw , as though he were bursting into tears . " These people are good , worthy people , " said Miss Todd rather indifferently . " But their values are different from ours , please remember , Doctor Moss . " " What are their values , may I inquire ? "  | " Valor . Piety . Honor . " " Not love ? " whispered the doctor . " Not humanity , Miss Todd ? " " Not our kind of humanity , " she said whimsically . " Not our kind of love , I 'm afraid . " " They are irresponsible , " snapped Dr. Moss , gathering courage . " They all border on criminality . " " Criminality , Doctor Moss ? " " You know what I mean , I think , Miss Todd . " " Forgive me , " said Miss Todd . She felt her cheeks tingling with a rush of fever . The stars grew blurred ; the night swam . " I do n't believe I do , quite . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep back her temper . There was something she needed to say . " We must try  --  we must try to  --  " Dr. Moss gazed at her through his tight little pupils ; his spectacles gleamed . " Yes ? What must we try ? " " We must try to love them , " she said lamely after a moment . She felt that all she had suddenly learned was now eludingher again , drifting away like the fumes from a brazier . She wandered off , following the narrow black terrace around the roof . The land below stretched into a wind-scarred anarchy . " Madame ! What are you doing here ? " A pale figure leaped out of the shadows . It was Ahmed , coiled in his jerd . He had lain asleep in the cooling breeze . " Nothing , Ahmed . I 've been strolling . " " You should not stroll here alone ! " " Why not , Ahmed ? " Ahmed glanced at the stars and said nothing . " Allah will protect me , " said Miss Todd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , madame ! " Ahmed 's eyes welled with love and surprise.  | " Nothing evil will ever come to you , madame , " he whispered . He sat down beside her on the coal-black mortar . For several minutes they said nothing . She felt his tenderness close beside her ; his virile faith , his hard simplicity . " The elderly sir is frightened , " said Ahmed tentatively , guessing her thoughts . " Yes . A bit , I imagine . " " The Makhfi has crept into him ! " " Mercy , Ahmed ! What is the Makhfi ? " Ahmed 's eyes were aglow . " The Hidden One , madame . May Allah preserve us ! He is worse than all the djinns and all the sikins . He is the worst of the spirits . He makes men shrivel and turn purple . And then they die . I tell you , the elderly sir will bring sickness , madame ! " " Perhaps you exaggerate , Ahmed ? " The breeze brushed her cheeks . And for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear Ahmed , " she cried , " we 're all full of djinns and naughty sikins ! " " No , no , " whispered Ahmed passionately . " Do n't mock me , venerable madame . They all believe it . The terrible Makhfi has crept into the elderly sir , I assure you ! " Nothing mattered to Miss Todd at this particular moment . She murmured faintly , " Perhaps it is the will of Allah ? " But Ahmed was n't listening . He was staring at her beads of carved agate . " May I see ? " he said , smiling , and opened his palm . She slipped the chain over her head . " Are they magic , dear madame ? " She smiled . " A little , maybe . " " Do they keep off the djinns ? " " Who knows ? They are yours , Ahmed . " The old listlessness was returning , nibbling away at her failing strength . Ahmed grinned and pressed the beads to his sun-scarred cheek . " Do you long for England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think not , " said Miss Todd.  | " Will you be sent back there ? When you are dead ? " Miss Todd paused and lowered her head . She felt no horror , no surprise , not even anger . " No , " she said gently . " I do n't suppose so , Ahmed . " Ahmed gazed at her with a trembling look . He took her hand and raised it toward his heart . " May Allah shower blessingson you ! " he said softly  |p63Soon  after dawn Ahmed came and woke them up , one by one . The air was crisp and transparent as they stole through the cloistered courtyard . The little guards still lay snoring on their narrow stone benches , smelling of sleep in their musty , sweat-clinging jubbas . The party hurried down ; the light grew brighter . A voice bleated , " To prayers , to prayers ! " And then from the rooftops came the reedy call of the muezzin . The new day began , flushed with expectancy . One more hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perfunctory , a day of lounging and loafing and coffee-drinking . Ahmed guided them toward the swamps , where the fishermenwould be waiting to take them around the cape . There , the following evening , said Ahmed , a larger vessel would pick them up . The Guleifa had already sailed without them . But he and Idris would stay with them . " As far as Aden , " whispered Ahmed . Idris met them at the gate with a sack of rice and a slaughteredkid , and the six of them  --  two sprightly Arabs and four uneasy Anglo-Saxons  --  made their way down the slope toward the stagnant marshes . Ahmed led them through a maze of turtle-brown hummocks . Their feet sank into the quagmire ; an ugly smell oozed from the ground . Large black crabs crept out of the crevices - repulsive beasts with claws spread out , covered with a beardlike growth of moss . They fled in battalions , clacking their claws as they scampered seaward . Finally the party came to the beach , which was gray and muddy and desolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White herons were flying high overhead , etched like a cry against the mute indifference of the sky . Three fishermen were waiting at the edge of the sand with their sambouk  --  dark young men from Eritrea , or Sudanese perhaps . They rose in front of the strangers and bowed with an elegant solemnity . Miss Todd gazed at them , first startled , then a little preoccupied . They were naked except for their sky-blue loincloths , which brought out the deep , luminous brown of their bodies . They were the most magnificent men she had ever seen . The sunlight shed little scimitars across their muscles , which were shining with oil and dark with indigo . Their hair was like wire ; their bellies flickered with light . One of them knelt to sharpen a stick with his knife . Then he rose in a single movement , smooth as a snake 's , and slipped the knife under his wrinkled loincloth . They stepped into the sambouk without a word . Mr. Maxwell was sitting beside Miss Todd in the boat . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salmon sea . Sabaya lay far behind them , bright as a coronet . Ahmed glanced nervously toward the harbor . The air was listless ; they were moving slowly . " Were you in India long , Mr. Maxwell ? " " Three years , Miss Todd . " " In Bombay ? " " Bombay , New Delhi . " " And now ? " " I 'll be in Athens for a year or two . " He smiled slyly . She looked into his eyes , disconcerted . His lips were parted , his teeth shone . So simple , so childlike on the surface ; so elusive underneath . A typical American ? Not quite . Or had she misjudged him ? There was irony in his smile . Drops of sweat shone on his handsome face , which was flushed and drawn with the Arabian sunlight . A beautiful man , thought Miss Todd  --  but somehow cold ,  |p65incom|plete  . His hair , just graying at the temples , clung to his head like a helmet . His face was still youthful but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melodious but oddly restrained , shy , tentative . " Tell me , Mr. Maxwell , have we changed , do you think ? Out here in the wilderness ? " A veil passed over his face . " Do people ever really change , Miss Todd ? " " Perhaps not . " Miss Todd folded her hands serenely . " Not at heart , at any rate . Outwardly perhaps . But after all , is n't it better for wickedness to come out into the open ? As it does in Arabia ? " David shot a cool , startled look at Miss Todd . " Really , I think  --  " he began . Idris waved his arm and shouted , " Look , Ahmed ! " There was the sound of a gun . The spray shot up where abullet skimmed over the water , a hundred yards or so to theleft . The fishermen cursed . Ahmed bellowed , " Treachery ! " Another bullet entered the sea . A moment later there werethree more shots . The passengers lay flat on their bellies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They waited ten minutes . The fishermen raised their heads and peered toward the shore . There was a cloud of dust where the horsemen were galloping back toward Sabaya . They waited ten minutes more . Silence hung in the air like a bubble . Slowly they rounded the cape . Sabaya was lost from sight . They landed in a tiny natural harbor surrounded by barren hillocks . Here , said Ahmed , they would have to spend the night , unfortunately . Perhaps the following night as well . The passengers stepped across the sand , which was hot and sharp as a bowl of cinders . Miss Todd felt herself weakening as she limped toward the shade . Something new was in the air  --  something invisiblyp66but fatefully wrong . Or no  --  not quite . Something subtly but appallingly right . Things were falling into their neat , appointedpattern . She groped her way through the rocks . The vision was upon her . A black thread started to vibrate in front of her eyes . Everything around her  --  the silent fishermen , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing in a single , sinister direction . The great thing was about to happen . Some final reconciliation perhaps ? No , not yet . Somethinghovered just beyond her reach  --  an aura , an emanation . She called , " Mr. Maxwell ! " The American knelt beside her . " I have a favor to ask you , Mr. Maxwell . " She opened her bag and took out a pigskin case . " Here . Please . These are safer in your hands , I 'm sure , than in mine . " She opened the case . A string of pearls , a diamond brooch , a sapphire bracelet . " They might be useful , do n't you think ? " She smiled wearily at the horizon . " One other thing , Mr. Maxwell . " " Yes , Miss Todd ? " " About Sylvia . She is only a child , you know . And then , you see  --  " She looked swiftly at the American , trying to appraisehim . Was she wrong ? Was he not quite so perceptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , please , Mr. Max-well ! " The American stared at her , horrified . He started to speak , but said nothing . Miss Todd looked away . Idris was crouching among the rocks . Ahmed was building a fire for the midday meal . Sylvia was dipping her feet in the water , and Dr. Moss was wiping his sun-glasses . The fishermen below were bailing out the sambouk . Miss Todd lay back and closed her eyes , suddenly dizzy with pain.  |p67A  line of flamingos passed over the shore toward sunset . They floated above the dunes , with their great claws trailing . Then they were gone ; the sky grew hollow and lifeless . Miss Todd turned her head away from the sun . A twinge of pain dug at her neck . Her head shot forward as she gasped for breath . The pain was like a burning wire slowly tightening around her larynx . The air thinned , and a last mirage went dancing over the plain  --  a patch of oil which lay squirming like fat in a frying pan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sandy hills were flooded with gold , which scattered its brightness like a field of corn rippling in the wind . Then all grew subdued . Light , color , shape , shadow , all withdrew , leaving only a haze of equivocal , dove-gray masses . These too lost substance a moment later , and only stillness remained , the yawning vacancy of the Arabian dusk . She closed her eyes . Her hold on reality was shriveling away . All was emptiness  --  a gaping , repellent void . Her senses kept struggling , trying to grasp a human residue . There was none  --  no passion , no communication . She lay stiff with hor -- ror . Nothing was real or identifiable . She felt herself yieldingto a force grander , more ruthless than she had ever ex -- perienced . The pain grew blurred as it swept through her body . It was like a giant wave sweeping her up . A minute later it vanished . She felt a surge of relief . Her nerves lay passive , subdued . She let herself flow on a current of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patternp68like the chips of glass in a kaleidoscope . A familiar landscape emerged , as though by sheer accident . A small stream flowed through a copse of beech trees and went winding past a meadow . Buttercups danced in the wind , their petals glossy as satin . In the distance rose the moss-gloved walls of the ruined abbey . Swallows dipped through the windows . The air was windless , the grass unruffled . The beeches stood motionless on the hillside , glowing like freshly poured bronze . A distant figure , a young woman 's , was waving from the arch of the gate . A bird called . The world seemed caught under a bell of glass . She sank back into the Hadhramaut . The light was slippingfrom the edge of the water . A perpetual dusk seemed about to enclose the world . There was no sign of life except for a black-shelled crab which crossed the sand and slid into the oily waves . Sylvia came up and knelt beside her . Miss Todd felt her nearness without opening her eyes . " Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's been a difficult day . " " Dear Miss Todd ! Are you better ? " " Of course . Why should n't I be ? " She patted Sylvia on the head . " Go and have a nap before dinner , my dear . " Sylvia took her hand and pressed it to her lips . Suddenly she burst into tears . " Miss Todd , Miss Todd ! " " Good heavens ! What 's wrong , dear ? " " I 'm frightened , Miss Todd ! " " Perfect nonsense , " snapped Miss Todd . She looked more closely at Sylvia . What was it that disturbed her ? " My dear Sylvia , " she said softly , " there is nothing to be afraid of ! " " Miss Todd  --  " " There . Be quiet , dear . " Sylvia knelt silently beside her . Dusk lapsed into night , and a marshy breeze rose from Ash Shihr.  |p69A  little later she woke up again . A white-hot needle shot through her , stabbing her chest and clawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit her palm in a fierce , half-crazed determination not to scream . The pain passed again , leaving her utterly limp . The wind from the gulf played lightly over her face . The air was full of a spicy , mintlike freshness . The sea blazed under the starlight , bright and tremulous , intensely near . She felt she could touch it with her fingertips  --  like the scales of a trout . She glanced at the stars , suddenly startled . She realized abruptly that she was dying . Ahmed crept up beside her . " Look , Ahmed . The stars . . . " He cocked his head . " Yes , my madame . The stars are on fire . " " See  --  that one ! Almost green ! " " Ah , " breathed Ahmed . " It is the star of Courage . " Miss Todd touched his cheek with her fingertips , stirred bya deep , quaint tenderness . " Ahmed , Ahmed  --  I wonder  --  " " Madame ! Lie back ! You are weak ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face melted in a look of compassion . " Madame , " he said in a trembling voice , " 1 truly love you . If I could give away ten years of my life "  --  he plucked at his thick brown chest  --  " I would give them all to you , illustrious madame ! " Miss Todd smiled . " You are a generous man , darling Ahmed . " She added abruptly , " How is your snake today ? " Ahmed squeezed his hands gratefully . " Oh , just the same as yesterday . A little bit hungry and bored , I think . " He tucked his hand into his futah and pulled out the snake by the tail . The poor reptile looked disconsolate , with bloodshot eyes and a sagging chin . It curled up in Ahmed 's lap , burying its snout under its tail . Ahmed started to charm it , waving his forefinger and humming . " Look ! He hears thep70snake-angels ! " The old snake swayed halfheartedly . Then it lay down again with a crushed , dyspeptic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bad , lazy Ius-lim ! " Iuslim blinked guiltily and crawled back under the sash . Everything grew black ; Miss Todd 's head suddenly fell forward . She lapsed into a deep and dreamless slumber . She woke up at sunrise , feeling surprisingly well . She turned her eyes and looked toward the sea . A cool , green haze veiled the distant sambouks and the tiny fishermen . Life was straining at the leash , waiting to burst into color . She stared at the sea , feeling the heightening suspense in the air . The light came closer , unfolded . But then something went wrong . Instead of a burst of splendor there was only an air of pause , of indecision . The light shot forth , but a moment later it defeated itself as the brilliance dissolved in a barren overdose of illumination . Several of the men were down by the water , saying their morning prayers . The surf looked windless , serene . No hint as yet of that globe of heat which lurked in the tawny hills , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishermen . The fisherman called back . Mr. Maxwell was wading through the shallows , taking his morning dip . Miss Todd was aware that she had something urgent to say to Sylvia , and was about to call . She felt a twinge of discomfort ; she decided to wait . She rose cautiously and crept toward the hidden space between two rocks . There she crouched for a minute or two , aware of a dull , gathering vertigo . She got up and started back . But the world suddenly lurched ; the sea shot up at a dizzy slope . She gripped the rock for support and leaned over it helplessly , waiting for the spasm to pass.  |p71And  then she grew conscious of a rapid change in her body . She felt her skin growing brittle , like the shell of an egg  --  under the shell a new awareness was developing , a fabric frail and sensitive as cobweb . The eggshell began to crackle ; it was falling away , chip by chip . The light grew feverishly real , as though it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were reaching forward and backward into time . She murmuredhastily to herself , " Yes . Yes . At last . " Her mind flounderedaimlessly , caught in a great white web . " Now , " she whispered . " Now , now  --  " The last of her questionswas about to be answered . The sky sang , " One more minute ! " " Wait ! Wait ! " cried the sea.  |p75They  crept quietly down to the shore at twilight . The air hung thin , gray , secretive . Gulls were wheeling above the rocks . The rites had been performed in their own cursory fashion . Ahmed had wept , Idris had prayed . Miss Todd had been buried in a corner of the inlet , where a fan of rock overhung the sand , leaving it in continual shadow . A decorous silence covered the shore ; the men squatted among the stones , waiting . The new vessel finally arrived , older and shabbier than the Guleifa . The crew came ashore in the little youyou , headed by the captain , Mohammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mohammed gruffly . " Or the islanderswill find us . " They boarded the Fatima at nightfall and slid quietly out to sea . She was a dhow from Oman , perhaps eighty feet long , with a little deck at the stern above the hollow thwarts . The compass was framed in a small brass temple with a lamp inside . There was something in the smallness and dilapidation of the boat which was somehow impressive , antique , heroic . " How old is she ? " asked David . " Oh , the age of Abdullillah over there , " said Said merrily . Abdullillah and Mohammed were the old ones , wise and bitter with the sea , faces hacked like driftwood . They looked like figures out of the Arabian nights with their woolly beards and tattered robes and silver knives thrust in their belts . Nasir and Said were the young ones . Said was thickset and garrulous , with a pock-marked face and eyes like a deer 's . Nasir was a dark-skinned Apollo , aloof and impenetrable.  |p76They  hoisted the sails to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their futahs , their long thin muscles gleaminglike iron . Night fell . The little dhow kept humming as she sped along on the brink of the waves . The hours passed silently . The men lay down and dozed among the bales . David watched the sails move slowly across the stars . Mohammedbin Aissa sang the same little tune over and over , his voice so low that it seemed to rise out of the waves . David slept and woke up again . Sylvia lay wrapped in Ahmed 's djellaba , no larger than a child , her cheeks bright as satin under the starlight . Dr. Moss lay curled up on the opposite side of the deck . The sea rose around them into a wrinkled plateau , while the distances beyond sank into great yawning hollows . The echoing gulf , low , tender , welled all around them . The rich proximity of the sea was like the presence of a slumbering herd . On they sailed , cutting the black , white-bubbled turmoil . Morning came , thin and pearly , and they passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semicircular white beaches . There was a derelict squalor about this landlockedwater . Shallow lagoons lay filled with idly floating jetsam . The tide was low ; the coral reefs were ripe with stench . Waterlogged canoes were drifting through the spreadinglight . In the deeper transparency the Fatima 's passengers could see the shapes of giant rays . Along the mirage-studded shore rose great shining steeples which suddenly dwindled , as the boat approached , into drab little fishermen 's huts . Some Somali boys were harpooning the rock-dwelling fish with their harbas . An old man sat on a rock , smoking his water-pipe . Suddenly they saw a large boutre emerge from the shelter of one of the cliffs and pass slowly southward over the dead brown sea . She was an odd-looking vessel , squat and somehow surreptitious  --  not quite a fishing boat , not quite a coaster . She passed several cable-lengths to the leeward of the Fatima . Mohammed bin Aissa drew his hand over his chin . Nasir stood by the wheel , pale and expressionless . The breeze grew gusty . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pattern of racing clouds . A heavy swell foreboded the violence of the oncoming wind . They passed a new group of rocks , a wild , tortuous archipelago . Then they saw several sails emerging from the silhouetted cliffs behind them , running before the gathering storm . " Look , " said Abdullillah , folding his arms around his bony chest . His fierce little face stood out like a hatchet , the beard cocked impudently at the hidden sun . The men glanced darkly at the mysterious vessel , which now appeared to be following the Fatima . She loomed high and narrow , end on , directly astern of them , a snow-white pillar rising from the sea . The Fatima 's wake pointed toward her like a broken reflection . She was moving swiftly . The Fatima took heart and gathered speed unexpectedly , flicking lightly at the burst of foam as she passed . Now and again a flash of spray flew up at David 's face . Sylvia was crouching on the deck , peering like a dwarf through the hood of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being followed ; that was obvious . Was the vessel gaining on them ? Ever so slightly , perhaps . The thrill of the race seized their spirits . Now the wind came in great rollicking gusts , and once a spear of sunlight pierced the rolling clouds . They saw the tall white sail flash in the momentary brightness , swaying in their wake like a mighty blade . Then it faded again in the murky shade of the clouds . David stood behind Ahmed . " Will she catch us , Ahmed ? " Ahmed smiled in his cool , grave way and gazed absently at Mohammed , who seemed lost in the gloom of some private enigma . " We 'll keep our distance till dusk , " growled Ahmed . " Then we 'll haul off to seaward . " The coast emerged and receded as the squalls of rain passed between them . Abdullillah sat on the stern deck near the rudder head , his profile like a gargoyle'sagainst the banners of cloud . " She 's in chase , " he croaked . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who we are ? " said David . " Know ? " snarled Abdullillah . " Of course they know ! "  | " Who told them ? " Abdullillah squeezed his lips shut and tightened the cape around his neck . Now the vessel was gaining on them unmistakably  --  more and more swiftly , it seemed . They shaved the cape . For an instantthe sails hung idle to the masts as the wind failed suddenly in the shelter of the promontory . Then the gust returnedand filled them again , and the dhow sped along on the smoother water . The Fatima seemed suddenly liberated , sweeping along exultantly as the clouds fell apart . " A bad ship , " remarked Ahmed , squatting beside David . " Who are they , Ahmed ? " " Who knows ? Pirates from Ethiopia , maybe . " " What are they after ? " " Ah ! Plunder . Gold . Diamonds . Sapphires . " David grew thoughtful . " Tell me , Ahmed . Do you trust these men ? " Ahmed glanced silently across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was growing darker . Again the larger vessel was gaining on them . She looked like a ghost ship to David as she swayed in the Fatima 's wake , no longer white but a drab , elephant gray . Night crept toward them . The squall had died . The coast disappeared . The Fatima sprang into the sudden darkness like an arrow . The pursuer vanished from sight , but David sensed , under the air of relief , some lingering flavor of treachery . Mohammed bin Aissa leaned toward Said and whispered in his ear ; then he beckoned to Nasir and swung his jerd over the bottom of his face . Nasir walked slowly back and took hold of the tiller . His fine , tense eyes were frozen and clouded . Suddenly Said cried out , " Broken water ahead ! " At that same moment there was a noise under the Fatima'sp79keel  --  the scrunching of coral . A quiet shudder passed through the ship . Said screamed from the bows , " The ship is aground ! " Mohammed bin Aissa ran forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keel tightening slowly . And then a small , crisp crash as the ship settled hopelessly . The hiss of the water had died . There was a sinister stillness , broken only by the silky whine of the wind . A moment later David heard the sound of a gradual , gentle gurgling  --  a rush of water and then a quick tense lapping against the inner walls of the ship . The Fatima was sinking . Said was throwing the deck cargo overboard . The ship swayed , leaned over heavily . She shook with a brittle , splintering sound each time a new wave seized her and vainly tried to shake her loose . A sharp wail rose , almost human ; some new wound had been inflicted . David could see the fish of prey already gathering , darting about in streaks of phosphorescence . A long deep creaking issued from the heart of the ship , and a moment later the mast came crashing as the poop-deck split and leaped in the air . But the men were already climbing into the youyou , laden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvia into the dinghy , and that same moment he caught sight of two dark arms gripping Nasir from the back . There was a bark like a mastiff 's as both men shot overboard . The other men , grunting with fear , were all in a cluster , hauling desperately at the little youyou . Said was scramblingon all fours . Dr. Moss leaped clumsily . Sylvia called to David , " Quick ! " David reached out and felt himself gently , irresistibly tugged from behind ; and then something , perhaps the swinging tiller , knocked him over senseless . He came to in the youyou . It was moving through the shelterof a cove . Said and Abdullillah were keeping her straight with their oars . They made for the strip of sand which shone in the moonlight , and presently landed . Ahmed picked upp80Sylvia in his arms and waded through the shallow water . Dr. Moss climbed on Idris 's back and was dropped on the sand as decorously as possible . But David was hardly aware of them . The pain in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bruise with a small wet cloth as David lay by the fire . " Feeling better ? " said the doctor presently , settling himself beside David . " It 's nothing , " said David , closing his eyes . " Just a nasty little bump . " " Scoundrels , " said the doctor . " Absolute scoundrels . " David turned away listlessly . A dark speck swam on the edge of his consciousness . It was like the missing piece in a puzzle . He rehearsed the days ' events in his mind , trying to bring them into order . But something kept eluding him . Some crucial fact kept sliding out of his grip . He tried to visualizein turn the plane , the ship , the island , the castle , the harbor , searching for some pungent , revelatory detail ; but as soon as an image crystallized in his mind a tiny stain emerged from one corner , spreading a blur across his vision . The pain in his head grew less . He listened to the embers crackling . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideways and caught sight of Dr. Moss staring into his eyes with a strange , nervous intensity . He shifted his position so that only the sweep of the sea was visible , and fell into a heavy , oppressive slumber . It was dawn when he woke up again . A scarlet sun was rising , gilding the frail , pitiful wreck which still trembled in the distance . Said brought them their tea , and the Moslems said their prayers . Then they climbed back into the youyou and followed the coast.  |p81They  reached Bir Barnut at noon . Said bargained for two hours with the local nacouda for the men and donkeys to take them to Kumra . No large vessels touched Bir Barnut ; it would be best to reach Kumra by land  --  especially , hinted Ahmed , since the seas were " unfriendly . " Abdullillah and Said , the cook , would go along , as well as Idris and Ahmed . At Kumra , explained Ahmed , they would take a camel caravanwhich would head toward Mukalla . Presently the carriersappeared , their torsos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied to their necks  --  to " cure wounds , " as Ahmed explained , with a touch of envy . " Greedy tribes ! " said Abdullillah disapprovingly , gesturing toward the soukh . " What do they want ? " inquired David . " Ten rupees for each donkey , " said Said . " And five rupees for the food , and five for each carrier . " " Quite a lot , do n't you think ? " Said belched . " A very big lot ! " " What is the food , do you suppose ? " " Rice . Dates . Tea . Limes . " " Any meat ? " Said pointed noncommittally at two glassy-eyed cockerels which hung jangling against a kettle . " Three rupees apiece , " he said wryly . " Rather skinny , are n't they ? " " Oh , not very . For three rupees they are sufficiently fat . " Presently the donkeys appeared , and the final preparations were made . David bought a new djellaba for Sylvia , whosep82dress was in tatters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow braid . David felt extremely well ; the pain in his head had gone completely ; there was only a tiny plaster to mark the bruise . The misgivings , the disorientation of the previous night were gone . Everything seemed , in this crystal air , unusually neat , clear , solid . He reached instinctively toward his pocket . Yes , the little jewelcasewas still there . He took Sylvia by the hand , and they strolled through the little soukh , pawing the stray bits of leather and brass and pottery . The heat of noon died away , and the little caravan started off , heading for the labyrinth of hills which shielded Bir Barnut from the west . Zebra-striped lizards two feet long ran scuttling in front of the donkeys ' hoofs . A line of corrugated cliffs rose suddenly to a barren plateau , beneath which yawned the gullies filled with slow , reddish waters . The ancientcamel paths went zigzagging past onion-shaped mounds , and as the light grew dusty with evening the contours of the land grew spidery , the rough sprawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men in the distance , pilgrims to Mecca maybe  --  naked men with shaved heads , each carrying a black parasol . They moved through the clouds of dust with glazed , vacuous expressions , as though they were floating on little clouds . The air up in the foothills was pure , pellucid . The sea vanished in the south . They entered the heart of Arabia . A young boy named Mustafa walked beside David 's donkey . He started off in high spirits , but toward dusk he was wincing with pain ; his feet were swollen and bleeding . David swung from his donkey and placed the boy in the saddle . Mustafa smiled , rather uncomfortably . Five minutes later he climbed off again . " Now I am well , " he explained gallantly.  | " Look ! Your heel is all swollen ! " " No , it is fine , " pleaded Mustafa . His spaniel eyes beamed softly at David as he stroked the donkey 's mane . The donkey was a delightful , intelligent creature , listening to every word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were full of a liquid , quizzical surmise ; his body was as trim as a ballerina 's . The staccato of his hoofs was crisp and cheerful , like a spoon in a teacup . " What is his name ? " said David . Mustafa blushed and said nothing . " Even a donkey should have a name , Mustafa . " " We call him Queen Victoria , sir . " " But Queen Victoria was a lady ! " " Ah , " said Mustafa . " She was a queen ! " He grinned delightedly . " The donkey also is a fine , elegant queen ! " They entered the valley , and the hard gray dirt changed to a sucking , slithering sand . A small town clung like a bird 's nest to the crest of the hill . " In three weeks , " said Mustafa proudly , " we will have a war with that town . " " Really ? Why ? " " The truce expires , " said Mustafa , placing his finger against his nose . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all excited about the war . " " Must there be a war , Mustafa ? " Mustafa looked puzzled . " It will be a fine war , I think , sir . Sieges . Shooting . Revenge . Everyone is pleased about the war coming . " Dr. Moss was following close behind them . Mustafa turned uneasily . His face grew clouded . " Tell me , Mustafa  --  " " Sh ! Sir  --  " " What is wrong ? " " He is listening ! " whispered Mustafa , glancing at Dr. Moss , and scampered ahead on his bleeding feet to walk beside Idris.  |p84They  settled for the night at the wall of Qubaida . At sunsetthe view had spread on every side for many miles , but when night fell the hills closed in like a curtain . A goat was roasting on a spit in the fire Said had lit , and the men lolled lazily in the lap of a dune . The flames were licking at the meat with little blue tongues . They were all in a sulky mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Moss was scribbling away in his notebook , and Sylvia sat silently with her chin on her hands , dark and windburned under the hood of the white djellaba . The meat crackled and was done . Said cried , " To the feast , gentlemans ! " One by one the men got up and walked to the fire , cut off a chunk of meat , and lumbered back to the circle , munching . One or two of them prowled off with their bones , like dogs , to chew them alone in the darkness . The fire grew low . The men were dozing . The real world receded . Dr. Moss crept off into the dunes with his rug . Sylvia sat staring into the embers . " What are you dreaming about ? " said David . Sylvia started . " About Miss Todd ! " " Miss Todd ? " said David . The name echoed faintly , like a pebble dropped into a well . " I almost feel she 's still here , " said Sylvia , glancing behind her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very much , I think . " He was watching Sylvia with a new curiosity , as though he were trapping a butterfly . Some subtlety in her nature seemed on the brink of revelation . She drew her fingers along her cheek . The light from the coals played on her face ; she looked wild , Polynesian , peering through her long black lashes . " You are a very brave girl , " said David softly . She glanced at him quickly . " No , " she whispered . " I 'm not brave . I was terribly frightened once or twice ! " She leanedp85forward and peered at him anxiously . " Tell me , Mr. Maxwell . Are they following us ? " " Do n't worry . We 'll be in Kumra tomorrow . " " Do you think , Mr. Maxwell  --  " " Call me David , wo n't you ? " " Something is wrong . What is it , David ? " " We 're Unbelievers , remember . They 've been taught to hate us . " She glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a blanket . " It 's  --  he , is n't it ? " David paused . " What makes you think so ? " " The way they look at him . Have n't you noticed ? " " I ca n't say I have . " " And then  --  " " Yes ? " " There is something a wee bit odd about him ! " " Poor little man . So out of place . " " They 're afraid of him , are n't they , David ? " " Go to sleep , my dear . You 're imagining things . " She lay down on her side with a sigh , staring at the ashfurredembers . David watched her fall asleep . Her arm twitched faintly , like a sleeping animal 's . He lay back , slightly drugged by the heaviness of the eveningmeal . One hand lay stretched out on the sand ; the other lay cupped over his pocket . Little by little his consciousness ebbed from the tips of his body ; his fingers and toes , then his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into sleep . His senses nodded ; his eyes and his ears and even his nostrils dozed off . Finally only a small , clear knot in the tip of his brain still hung awake  --  a tiny bulb of awareness , afloat on a sea of slumber like a cork bobbing among the waves . It was a moment of isolated , accentuated susceptibility . Even as he lay there he was obscurely aware of its power ; just enough to say to himself , Something is wrong , something is going to happen . . . . But then , as far as the visible world was concerned , noth/ing did happen . The Arabs slept without stirring , the fire gradually died , and the desert grew black as pitch , until at last , very stealthily , like a ferret stalking its prey , a wispy , lemon-bright moon rose out of the dune to the right of the well-house.  |p87The  next day dawned bright as a crystal , and they started across the jol . In the early sun the blunt red mounds cast arrowy shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limestone . Three hours later they rode downhill again toward the river-bed . Lean white goats strolled through tufts of Salvadora persica , and a tiny shepherdess lurked in the distance , wearing a conical black hat . The sunlight flashed on her hatchet as she chopped the twigs from the fuzzy saplings . Sylvia waved to her as they passed . The shepherdess gaped at her bashfully and went galloping lightly over the bushes . They went on riding along the wadi-bed , keeping to the sides of the wadi , under the fringe of shadow cast by the steep corroded shore . A boy was loitering in the distance with a kite on a string . Idris called to him teasingly , " Qabunum tayib ! " " What is he saying ? " asked Sylvia . David was n't quite sure . He asked Idris , but Idris merely grinned and made an obscene gesture . An old woman in a purple hood passed by , making her way across the wadi-bed with a watering pot on her shoulders . She stood and watched them , half covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " cried Idris , exuberant . " Oh , just the throw of a stick , " squealed the woman , placingtwo fingers on her forehead . A dark figure came riding across the plain . He drew closer through the dust , which swirled about him like a cape , and soon the glittering black mare came prancing alongside thep90Mukalladead man 's swollen body . He must have been dead a week or more . Said gave a thrust . The corpse rolled over ; the face was seething with maggots . " Do n't , " cried Ahmed . " Do n't touch him ! " The men recoiled . Idris seized Sylvia by the hand and drew her back . Abdullillah flung his jerd over his cheeks so that only his foxy little eyes shone forth , shrill and agitated . " The blue sickness , " he kept whispering . " The terrible Makhfi ! " Ahmed cast three handfuls of sand over the body and drew a pattern on the nearby earth , diamond-shaped . In the center of the diamond he placed three little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To frighten the Makhfi , " breathed Idris . " Come , little madame . Bad , bad ! " They rode on toward Kumra and entered a narrow valley , where they met a pious-faced procession . Dark peasants swayed lazily past the trees on their small white donkeys , with maybe a sheep flung over the saddle , or a bag of rice . Two Negro soldiers followed the peasants , wearing only their cartridgebelts . Then came a column of women with enormous baskets on their heads , sky-blue trains billowing along on the sand behind them . " Where are they going ? " said Sylvia discreetly . " To the feast , " said Ahmed , squinting . " What sort of feast ? " " Oh , just a feast . It has no name . " He smiled indulgently at Sylvia . " Many things have no name in our land , little madame ! " The old patriarchs filed past them , clad in snow-white , and then a row of dark-hooded folk who kept whispering and chanting . Only their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bony hands , black with the sun , clutching the sacred phials.  |p91They  rode down the slope and entered a deep ravine . The hardening light of the afternoon drew tiger stripes across the opposite ridge . Sylvia 's bones were aching with the jolts of the donkeyride . Her skin was burning . The powerful light refracted from the gravel seemed to pierce even the folds of her cape . " Kumra ! " cried Idris . A line of cliffs shot out of the east , and suddenly Sylvia caught sight of the city perched between two crags  --  a giant structure of limestone and mud , dented by columns of blacksilledwindows . " A holy city , " observed Idris . " Bad for the Unbeliever . " " No matter , " said Ahmed quickly . " We stay only a night . Two nights at the most . " Three men came riding over a hillock . One of them shook a stick and hailed them briskly . " Are you friends , over there ? " " Friends ! Certainly ! All of us ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Friends of the Sayyid of Masna'a ! " " Peace be with you ! " " You too ! " The men rode on . The path turned , and they saw the cliff looming in front of them like a great ant-hill , with a fringe of lights twinkling in the dusk . The city gradually lost its impressiveness as they drew closer . The proportions seemed to shrink ; the houses looked grim and squalid . As they rode alongside the walls the scent of sewage welled up at them . They entered the gate . Ap92swarm of ragamuffins came gamboling through the dust , cryinghoarsely . Abdullillah jabbed his umbrella at them ; they flew , twittering , into the crannies , like a flock of sparrows . Ahmed led the way down a winding street and came to a halt by a bronze door . An old man came shuffling up to them , waving his arms and chattering wildly . " Peace be with you ! A thousand welcomes ! " " Yes , you too ! God has been merciful . " The light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color . The carbide lamps began to glisten . Pale figures tiptoedthrough the alleys . It was the world of Sindbad and Ali Baba . One touch of the wand , thought Sylvia , and it would vanish like a soapbubble . " This way , this way ! " cried the old man , with his blue sash fluttering . They followed him down the street , surrounded by clamor on every side . Long-haired boys in tattered skullcaps kept scurrying around them , clapping their hands . They passed a row of tiny shops no bigger than caves , with the oil lamps glowing on aisles of pottery and burnished kettles , and here and there stray , inexplicable fragments of the West  --  a hubcap , a bicycle tire , an empty whisky bottle . A thickset patriarchwith a face like a walnut and a web of beard reaching down to his belly was tucking his tray of sweets under the carpet . He turned and fluttered his arms . " Faranchi " he cried . " Wicked faranchi ! " The inn was at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The donkeys followed drowsily , blinking their eyes . Abdullillah led them , one by one , into the hay-scented courtyard . The innkeeper sprang out of the darkness , a birdlike creaturewith a withered arm . He started whispering to Ahmed , glancing significantly at Sylvia . " They have only three rooms , " said Ahmed apologetically . " That 's all we need , " said Dr. Moss . " Three humble rooms , " chirped the innkeeper.  | " Can you serve us dinner ? " " A humble dinner , sir . " " Do you have fresh water ? " " Ah ! Miraculous water ! " " And what do we pay ? " The innkeeper coughed . " Oh , an insignificant sum , sir . Whatever you wish . One tiny American dollar , perhaps ? " The oil lamp stood on a small carved table with a top no larger than a platter . Small white moths covered the ceiling like a fold of lace , and outside the bats were dipping in and out of the eaves . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hostility . Sylvia sat by the window and looked into the night . The valley below had changed its texture ; it looked peaceful and pastoral . The sleeping animals in the distance looked like sheep in a moonlit meadow . She walked to the opposite window , which looked down on the city . A covert excitement was in the air . The streets were garlanded with flowers , and the flames from the oil lamps danced on the mosque . Three boys were playing in the courtyard , beating one another with twigs . Indigo cloths were cast over the wall to dry . A flute started playing . The boys shot through an arch and vanished . The court was empty ; nothing stirred ; but a moment later two shapes in yellow kaftans stepped through the gate , arm in arm . They paused and whispered , glanced around , and lay down in the darkness . It was a world of males . The women sat hidden in nearby rooms ; Sylvia could hear them chattering in their crisp little voices , ticking away like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A large man stepped through a door and paused directly under Sylvia 's window . A ray of light fell on his face . He was a man in his middle forties , with a knife in his belt and a belligerent , tribal look on his face . He called up to her in his soft wild voice and tossed something through the window . It lit on thep94floor  --  a paper flower , smelling of sandalwood , with a tiny inscriptionon each petal . She placed it on the table beside the lamp . She undressed and lay down in the bed , which sagged beneath her like a hammock . Her heart was beating violently . Was it excitement ? Or exhaustion ? No , neither ; it was something else , some frail , unfamiliar kind of elation . She tried to sleep , but her eyes stayed open , following the patterns in the sky through the open window , discovering a new , seethingbrilliance in the arc of stars outside . She raised her fingers to her cheeks . They were hot and feverish . Someone knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Dr. Moss , carrying a tall white candle in his hand . Something tightened in her throat ; suddenly she was on the brink of tears . " Are you quite all right , Miss Howard ? " " Oh , quite , Doctor Moss ! " " Is your bed clean and comfortable ? " " Yes . At least , I think so . " He stood beside her and leaned down . " I 'm in the room across the hall . If there 's anything you need , do n't hesitate , please  --  " She lay still as a feather . " You 're tired , my dear . " " Well , a little , I suppose . " He placed his hand on hers . She quailed ; something in the touch of his skin revolted her . " It 's a quaint little spot , " he remarked . " Rarely visited . Rather forbidding . Even the Arabs prefer to avoid it . In preIslamictimes it appears to have been a quite considerable metropolis . " The feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In a way , of course , " observed the doctor , taking off his glasses , " it 's rather unfortunate that we were forced to stop in Kumra . A notoriously inhospitable town . Distinctly xeno/phobe . But it 's an experience , my dear . You will never regret it , I 'm sure . You will have a glimpse into one of the most unfrequentedlocalities of the Middle East , a town of unusual cultural traditions  --  " " Doctor Moss  --  " " Yes ? What is it , Miss Howard ? " " I 'm dreadfully sleepy , Doctor Moss . " " Dear , dear . How rude of me . I 've been boring you to death . There , go to sleep , my dear . Good night . " The door closed ; she could hear another door opening and then closing across the hall . She kept listening uneasily , not quite sure what she was afraid of . And then the lamp flickered and died . She fell asleep . But a little later she woke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not remember where she was . She felt trapped in a prison . But then she knew . She rose and tiptoedto the narrow window . Yes , there he was , waiting  --  the man with the knife . His thick , brutal face shone in the light from a window . He was singing to her in a catlike whine . The smooth fold of his turban exaggerated his dark , bitten features . His white teeth glistened between his thick , unscrupulouslips . She stood and watched him for a minute or two , strangely excited . Then she leaned out and smiled and drew back instantly , bewildered , not understanding what was happening to her , or why it was happening , or how it would end.  |p96Dr  . Moss stepped through the door of the serai into the blindingsunlight . The whole street was a cascade of feverish , improbable colors . A torrent of merchandise flowed out of the shops , which crouched together under a tottering arcade , all shrouded in a vapor of dust that coiled lazily over the silks and sweetmeats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the grill : some little boys , thin as grasshoppers , were reciting the Koran . Two beduin girls were filling their goatskins at the fountainbeneath the mosque . They turned and smiled at him brazenly , then shawled their faces and moved away , with the bags bulging over their shoulders and their carmine skirts swirling around their ankles . Two young beduin came up alongside him , with tufts of wool tied under their knees ; one with a basket on a wooden yoke flung over his shoulder , the other with two roosters dangling from his wrist . They peered down at him with their bright insolent eyes . " Can we take you anywhere ? " said the older one . " Up to the fortress , for example ? " said the younger . " Or to the cafe ? " said the other , on whose chin a silky beardwas beginning to sprout . " Yes , thank you . The cafe , " said the doctor affably , and they led him up the hill toward the mosque , a neglected place full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market , where the sellers sat in rows with great baskets in their laps , weighing chunks of cooked meat in brightly painted scales.  | " Faranchi ! Faranchi ! " the little boys kept crying . " The fat haji will soon be at the cafe , " said the young man with the cocks . Dr. Moss nodded indifferently . " Oh . Really ? " He added something in his painstaking Arabic , but the boys looked at him vacuously and relapsed into their guttural Aden accent . " He is an Ingliz , " said the bearded youth . " English ? Really ? " said Dr. Moss . " He is as clever as a djinn . He knows everything . He even knows how to make gold ! " Dr. Moss kept nodding briskly as the beduin took him by the hand and led him toward a low gray building in the shade of the minaret . The entrance was low and narrow . They had to duck as they passed through the curtain . The room was so dark that at first Dr. Moss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man fanning coals in a brazier . There was a smell of charcoal and goat-cheese . A row of cushions lay along a wall , and beside them were two low , oval-shaped tables ; on each table stood a copper teapot and two tulip-shaped cups . The two beduin placed their loads on the floor and sat down silently at one of the tables and motioned gracefully to Dr. Moss . The younger one poured him a cup of tea with a festive air . Dr. Moss sank back on the cushion , feeling pleasantlyat ease . He watched the glow hovering over the coals , and the soft red light on the old man 's face . No one spoke . The curtain swayed in the heat . The curtain jangled , and a fat little man appeared in the doorway , pausing a moment on the threshold . Only the silhouettewas visible . He was hardly five feet tall . Then he stepped into the room . It was like a fish rising to the surface  --  the face , the hands slowly emerged . He waddled toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . He might have been a half-breed . There was something ambiguouslyp98Western about him . He wore a cashmere shawl over his shoulders , and underneath a silk beige gown . He was hideous ; a great blue scar crossed his cheek , sleek and swollen . His puckeredeyes flashed with a fawning , merciless glitter . He kept panting with asthma ; his breasts kept heaving . The bulging nipples and long black hairs clung to the wet , transparent silk . He poured himself a cup of tea and spread his fingers on the table . " You 're passing toward Aden ? " he said in a high , cultivated voice . His eyes kept traveling around the doctor 's body , never meeting Dr. Moss 's eyes ; astute and watchful . The doctor nodded . " Yes . As it happens . " The fat man smiled appreciatively , as though he were relishinga witticism . " You live here ? " said Dr. Moss . " More or less ! " The fat man smiled , showing a broken tooth . " May I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Hirsch . I 've been living in the Hadhramaut for thirty years . I know these people rather thoroughly , I may say . I love them , what is more . And at the same time I hate them . I simultaneously respect and despise them . I have taught them to fear me ; it 's the only way to get along here ! " His English was curt and fluent . He might have been Swiss or Viennese . Dr. Moss leaned forward and whispered , " Do n't you miss the  --  civilized world ? " " The civilized world ! " Hirsch pursed his lips . His eyes grew whimsical , pearly . " My dear sir , one year in Arabia is enough to strip one of illusions ! Civilization ! What do you mean by it ? Mozart ? Botticelli ? Ah yes , I too used to haunt the museums and concert halls of Europe . I spent my youth in Prague and Budapest . The delicacies of the intellect , the caviar of the spirit  --  I knew them all ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revolutionary movement . I believed in prog-ress , liberty , freedom . But Arabia , my friend , is like an X ray . It reveals the skeleton of humanity . Man is still a savage ani/mal . And savage he will remain , my dear sir , for another millionyears ! " " You are happy here ? " said the doctor tensely . " Yes . Sufficiently . In my own way ! " " You intend to  --  " " To die here ? Certainly ! " The fat man cackled faintly . " I am a legend here , you see  --  half demon , half demigod . I have been to Mecca . I am a haji . One must not desecrate a legend . " He lowered his eyelids discreetly . " Might I be of helpto you , by any chance , Mr.  --  ? " " Doctor Moss . Edwin Moss . " " Moss . Precisely . You are a doctor of medicine ? " " I am an archaeologist , " said Dr. Moss . " Ah . Most interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause , a subtle probing , like the stirring of antennae . " There are three of us here in Kumra , " said Dr. Moss . " Our plane was wrecked in the islands . " Hirsch kept nodding . " Yes . We heard about it . Three deaths , I believe . A great pity . We were deeply concerned . And now , naturally , you wish to arrange your passage to Aden . What , may I inquire , are your resources ? " His eyes took on a sloping look . Dr. Moss stared at the ceiling , then sipped thoughtfully at his tea . Finally he reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet . The banknotes rippled across the table . Hirsch 's eyes grew dull and expressionless . He gazed emptily toward the brazier and poured himself another cup of tea . Then he plucked the bundle of notes from the table , glanced at it casually , and dropped it again . " This will be more than sufficient , I think , to take care of your passage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moss . " He rose ponderously , gathering his shawl about him ; he heaved a sigh of apology . " I must leave you , unfortunately . We shall meet again , I have no doubt . I shall inquire about the caravans . And do be careful , my dear Doctor . It would bep100such a pity if anything went wrong here . " He shrugged his shoulders and shot a playful little smile past the doctor . He waddled back to the door , the curtain tinkled , and he melted into the blaze of sunlight . The two young men watched the doctor as he tucked the money back into his wallet . For several minutes they sat silently ; the brazier crackled . A sense of confidence and wellbeingspread slowly through Dr. Moss . Finally the older of the two young men , the more powerfullybuilt , leaned over the table and said politely , " Do you like my friend ? " Dr. Moss blinked his eyes . " I beg your pardon ? " " My friend is very beautiful ! " Dr. Moss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . The older one , the one with the beard , was broad-faced , rather oxlike . His friend was frail and slender , finely boned , with a girlish skin and eyebrows carefully defined . " You do n't care for him ? " said the one with the beard , narrowing his eyes as though he were looking through a telescope . His voice grew harsh and covetous . " Do you like me better ? I am very strong ! I will protect you ! I will kill your enemies ! I will guide you through the desert . " Dr. Moss wiped his brow . " My name is Qasim , " said the bedu , rising . " I will guide you through the desert tonight . " Dr. Moss felt a thrust of panic . " What did you say ? " The bedu kept jabbing the air with his thumb . " We will visit the desert . It will be very interesting ! Very fine ! Very lonely ! " Dr. Moss maintained a masklike expression . " I will come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor 's shoulder with his hand . " Soon after sunset . At the serai . Until then , much good fortune ! "  |p101The  two beduin picked up their birds and baskets and crossed the room . The one with the beard glanced back and nodded . Then they stepped through the tasseled curtain . The sloping light turned the street into a rich hard copper . Fine shadows fell over the walls , sharp as latticework . Dr. Moss threaded his way across the soukh . A hooded man , all in black , was hovering over a heap of beads . A goat-faced boy was buying some coffee husks and chunks of molasses . He dropped them in his shawl , glanced at the doctor , and fled . A shriveled woman jumped up from a pile of baskets and shook her arms in the air , rattling her bracelets . She snatched at the doctor 's shirt and cried , " Adaryayan ! Adaryayan ! " Dr. Moss tore himself loose and hurried down past the mosque . He felt dizzy ; an unfamiliar chill shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be ? He felt in his pocket for the quinine tablets , paused by the well , and slipped a capsule swiftly between his lips.  |p102David  lay drowsily on a heap of cushions in the serai garden , listening to the voices outside the wall . Beside him stood a low black table with a small brass teapot , finely designed in the shape of a dragon 's head , with the snout jutting out like a tongue . There was a rustle of footsteps down in the street . A bird shrieked overhead . He had slept for three hours and felt refreshed and at ease . A new feeling was alive in him ; his natural leaning toward melancholy had given way to a speculative optimism . Kumra was having a remarkably soothing effect on his nerves . The anxiety of the previous night was completely gone . He had spoken to Ahmed that morning . Everything was running along smoothly . He still had sufficient funds to take care of the passageto Mukalla , which Ahmed had encountered no difficulties in arranging . Lunch had been adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsided . Sylvia was well ; Dr. Moss had appeared in unusually amiable spirits . The past six days receded into a remote , improbable haze . They would be in Aden in three more days . Adventures like this , he decided , had an invigorating effect in the long run . Someone coughed . He turned his head . A withered man in a sea-green sash was mincing noiselessly toward him . He paused by the pool of goldfish and bowed ceremoniously . " The sayyid wishes to extend his gracious hospitality ! " He glanced furtively over his shoulder . " You are invited for dinner , Your Excellence . " " Oh  --  very kind . For tonight ? " " Yes , Your Excellence . You and the lady . "  | " I see . How shall we  --  " " I will fetch you , Your Excellence . In an hour . Will that be adequate ? " " Yes . Of course . " The servant vanished . A distant animation hung in the air . There was a far-off sound of footsteps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a hum of voices  --  but all of it tranquil , preoccupied , like the buzzing of bees in an orchard . A butterfly lit on David 's wrist , its wings stirring lazily and then opening out to gather the last drop of light . David cupped his hand over the insect and held it between his fingers . The wings were of a watered azure . He ran his thumb over them lightly ; it was powdered with iridescent dust . Dreamily , one by one , he plucked the wings from the body . The butterfly fell to the ground , wriggling helplessly , like a golden worm . The man in the sash led them through the darkening alleystoward the edge of the city . A lamp hung dangling from his waist ; the light danced around them . A trumpet sounded . The " great feast " was beginning that very night , muttered the servant . The houses were glowing with hundreds of oil lamps , which dotted the dusk like a swarm of fireflies . Childrenwere scampering along hurriedly , eyes aglitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate , beating their tambourines . Little by little a soft-footed crowd began to accumulate , following David and Sylvia toward the palace  --  gay and friendly , most of them , but here and there a querulous murmur , a hand crooked meaningly . They could see the banners fluttering on the sayyid 's palace , above the gate . A row of white-robed elders marched past them , thin , austere in their little skullcaps ; and then came a chirruping flock of girls , bright as butterflies in their magenta trousers , bells tinkling on their tiny ankles.  |p104Someone  threw a stone suddenly . It went scuttering down the alley , hit a small black boy . Someone else cried out fiercely . There was a pause , a tense expectancy . A voice in the background started shouting . The servant raised his lantern and called out , " Guests ! Guests of the sayyid ! " The crowd vanished like magic , and they walked on undisturbed . Finally they reached the palace and climbed the steps . The facade was veined with cracks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall over the entrance . There was an enormous door of carved wood , with hexagonal studs of polished brass . It opened with a groan ; a skirted Sudanesestood before them , with a holstered automatic thrust in his belt . His face was covered with great blue scars  --  from tribal skirmishings , possibly . They entered a passage . There was a smell of balsam . The hall widened , and they could see tiers of brass utensils lining the wall , and a row of carved mahogany chests . An American alarm clock was ticking noisily in the corner . The old sayyid sat in a large dark room hung with carpets . He was snoring daintily . The servant coughed and hung his oil lamp in the doorway . The sayyid twitched his head , closed his mouth , opened his eyes  --  small piercing eyes with a humorous , Zeus-like twinkle . He looked sly , wicked , kindly , with his pendulous lips and pouchy eyes . His fingers danced in the air . " Ahem . Good evening . " He got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider yourselvesofficially welcome to Kumra , my dears . " He spoke in a crisp Oxford accent , choosing his words with a lordly hesitation . " Sit down , please . On the couch . Would you like a cup of tea , little lady ? " " Thank you , Your Highness , " said Sylvia , wide-eyed . " India or China ? " said the sayyid wistfully . " Oh ! You have both ? " said Sylvia , brightening . " No , alas . " The sayyid sighed . " I have neither , I 'm afraid . But it is polite to inquire , do n't you think ? Here . Have ap105crumpet . " The servant raised the lid from an enormous pan . Two little biscuits lay on tarnished silver , dark and weathered as prunes . Sylvia plucked and bit at one of them ; it was hard as a walnut . " Sit down , " said the sayyid , rubbing his eyes demurely . " Forgiveme . I sleep rather badly . " He blinked at Sylvia . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home is in England , " said Sylvia faintly . " Ah , " cooed the sayyid . " England , England ! I spent two years in England , long ago . I studied poetry at Balliol . Shakespeare , Tennyson , Austin Dobson . You have beautiful poetry in England , I quite agree . Beautiful castles , beautiful forests . But "  --  he grinned cunningly  --  " it is a cold , cruel land ! " " Cruel ? " said Sylvia . " Ah ! " said the sayyid , squeezing his hands together . " Everythingin England looks soft and quiet . Soft grass , soft clouds , soft eyes and voices . But within you have souls like icicles ! And hearts like scissors ! Yes , my dear little lady , I felt rather miserablein England , to be quite frank about it . " A cymbal clashed in a distant corridor . A curtain parted . Two little footmen appeared , bearing copper bowls filled with rosewater . The sayyid dipped his fingers and rose majestically . " Forgive me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have been most ill-mannered , chatting away like this . Come , my dears . Dinner is ready . " They walked down a colonnade which opened on a cloisterlikegarden . Arched doorways , hung with heavy white draperies , opened at the end , and overhead spread a row of semicircularbalconies . Pigeons sat in the cornices , above , ruffling their feathers . In a corner sat a group of girls , sewing away at a rug . Their faces were hidden ; they looked like bats in their long gray shawls . One of them kept singing softly , and the others followed the rhythm with their needles . An Arabian cat , blue and fuzzy , went strolling across the tiles.  |p106The  city was flooded with an oblique torrent of light and then , five seconds later , sank into dusk . Dr. Moss stepped through the door . Twilight had muted the sounds as well as the colors , but the odors hung accentuated  --  the scent of smoke , oil , indigo , tinged with centuries of masonry and human refuse . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone tapped him on the shoulder . It was the bearded young bedu . In his woolly gray djellaba he looked quite different  --  moreshifty , more dandified . He flicked his thumb toward the southern gate . " Are you ready ? " he whispered . He shot a look behind him and took the doctor by the hand . They walked side by side . The doctor 's brief attack of dizziness had gone . Instead he felt a keen , slightly alarming exhilaration . He was wearing his little skullcap ; he felt , for some odd reason , unusually dapper , almost rakish . The mountain air , possibly . And , of course , a certain sense of triumph . He would be able to squeeze at least three scholarly articles out of Kumra , which was virgin territory , so to speak , from a strictly erudite point of view . The Journal of Archaeology would be only too grateful  --  " Kumra 's Pre-Islamic Remains " ; " The Himyaritic Inscriptions of Kumra " ; " Some Notes on the Architecture of Kumra . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of luck , to yield some interesting marginal observations . The alley curved . A tomcat was wailing behind a wall . They passed under an archway and crossed an irregularly shapedp107piazza . Two old men sat in a corner under a strip of burlap , smoking their hookahs . A charcoal brazier was burning beside them ; there was a smell of burnt almonds . The street narrowed until it was a black sewage-strewn corridor . The bedu 's grip tightened . He was walking more quickly . Dr. Moss heard the hiss of his undergarments as they brushed his limbs . " Where are we going , by the way ? " The bedu grinned . " Into the desert . Where it is lonely . " His face shot closer . His eyes seemed to dig into the doctor 's with a mingling of hate and calculation . " I will guide you . Do not be afraid , " he said hoarsely , flashing his teeth in a knifelikesmile . The street ended in a heap of rubble . A stench of garbage rose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the offal . Beyond shone the desert , bright as ice under the starlight . The bedu gripped the doctor 's wrist feverishly and with his other hand rapped him softly on the back . " Here . This is the place , " he muttered . Dr. Moss came to a halt . Sweat was trickling on his spectacles . A certain recurrent dream had been disturbing him these past few months : he found himself walking through a dark littered alley and arriving at the mouth of a cave , or it might have been the door of a small black hut . A stench of rotting meat came seeping through the door . He knew that something peculiarly horrible was lurking inside , but some irresistible magnetism sucked him through the door into the interior . At this point , unable to face the full bestiality of the revelation , he was seized by a kind of deliberate blindness , and he hurled himself into a pit , or it might have been a well , which yawned beside him . An instant later he invariably woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream seemed about to materialize . The bedu 's fingernails were digging into the palm of his hand . He paused , breathless with panic , as though a revolver were pointing at his heart.  |p108And  his head suddenly cleared . The night spread out with a burning vividness . He gave a cry and wrenched his hand away from the bedu 's . The bedu snatched at his shoulder , his eyes sparkling with an almost hysterical cunning . He growled something that sounded like " Garra ! Hamadurra ! " But then his voice disintegrated into a low , harsh gurgle . Dr. Moss tore himself loose , ducked swiftly as the bedu wheeled about , and dove past the wall . He gave a sharp , high scream as the Arab swung his fist , which glanced crisply off the doctor 's head . He started to run , clumsily at first and then faster and faster , with surprising agility . He reached the piazza , where the two old men were still sitting in precisely the same attitude , smokingtheir water-pipes in the glow of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes slightly . He muttered to his companion , who lowered his head and said nothing . There was a sound of hurrying footsteps . A voice sang behind the wall . Dr. Moss darted up a tiny dark street . A moment later he realized that he had taken the wrong turning . The walls rose high above him , drenched in a fine pale dust , which in the feeble light from the moon looked like a blanket of snow . The footsteps echoed behind him . He shot through an open doorway and found himself in a small rectangular garden . He sat down on the bottom step of a stairway , panting heavily . He was aware of his body in a new , oppressive way . It seemed hollow and frail , intensely sensitive at every pore . Thick dark flowers hung from a bush , exuding a raw , seminal odor . He closed his eyes , trying to put his mind in order . But a passionateundercurrent churned through his veins , destroying his powers of orientation . A spider crawled over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same moment a voice behind him murmured lackadaisically , " Come in . " Dr. Moss turned his head , too distraught to be startled . A door had opened , dropping a bar of light over the tiles . A slendershape in a long blue barracan stood silhouetted in the doorway.  |p109She  said again , more impatiently , " Come in , if you please . " Dr. Moss rose dreamily and climbed the stairs . He found himself in a small dimly lit room . Cushions of spotted brown leather lay scattered along the walls . A copper lamp dangled over a low , rather unsavorylookingcouch . " Here . Lie down . You are tired , " said the woman , straighteningthe camel's-hair coverlet . Dr. Moss sat down on the bed , feeling quite composed all of a sudden . The woman stepped toward the lamp and trimmed the wick . The room grew brighter . The folds of cloth on the bed , the intricate coils of the latticework  --  everything looked as though seen through a stereopticon , bright and frozen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not at all , thanks , " said the doctor . The woman stood beside the bed with her hands cupped over her breasts . She was gazing emptily at the wall . " Come . Lie down . Here . Like this . " She put a small green pillow under his head . Dr. Moss closed his eyes ; it seemed impossible to keep them open . Sleep came welling toward him in a huge gray wave . Or rather , not quite sleep , but a rich , heaving coma in which a mass of shadows writhed unrecognizably , like giant ferns at the bottom of the sea . He opened his eyes again with a violent effort . The lids kept trying to close , like magnets . Dimly he saw the woman kneel by the bed , reach across a low black table , and dip her hands in a little bowl . His eyelids shut irresistibly . But he was aware of something happening , something obscurely directed toward himself , and with a panicky thrust of the will he forced his eyes open again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils narrowed into small red pinpoints . A broad necklace of silver clung to her throat , each link heavily molded and setp110with an egg-shaped amber bead . She might have been forty . Her skin was faintly leathery , but in spite of her age she was unusually beautiful , with a long narrow face and a large but sensitive mouth , and great eyes which Dr. Moss found oddly disturbing  --  sad yet exultant . " Please excuse me , " he said faintly . " Dropping in on you like this . " " It does n't matter , " said the woman indifferently . " You are a nasrani , I can see . There was a young nasrani here eleven years ago . An Ingliz . But not like you . The Ingliz was tall and beautiful . You are small and ugly . " She spoke with complete detachment , in a deep resonant voice . " Why have you come ? To make love ? It 's rather late to make love . " " Please , " said Dr. Moss frozenly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panting , " said the woman , placing her finger on his pulse . " I  --  I suppose  --  " " You are frightened , " said the woman , leaning closer . " Have you killed someone ? " " No ! " cried Dr. Moss , appalled . But the question seemed curiously apposite , and for a moment he thought it might even be true . " No , no , " he muttered . " I lost my way . That 's all . " But the woman was n't listening . She kept running her finger along his wrist . He felt himself succumbing to a new , furry drowsiness . " Whenever an Ingliz comes to this city , " she said wearily , " there is trouble . Seven years ago there was the drought . Eleven years ago there was a plague of locusts . Why do you come to Kumra ? Why do n't you leave us alone ? " Dr. Moss was beginning to feel relatively calm again . He smiled apologetically . " We are on our way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day . We sha n't cause you any trouble , I can assure you , madam . " " Ah ! " said the woman , her eyes brightening . " I come from the hills , where the real Hadhrumi live . I have the power ofp111the Hadhrumi , which my mother taught me and also my grandmother . Also my aunt . That was in Shibwa , twelve years ago . I tell you , Ingliz , if you bring any trouble I will change you into a bird ! " The doctor gazed at her with concern . " Yes ! A tiny bird ! No bigger than this ! " She stretched out her middle finger and thrust it in front of the doctor 's nose . Then she rose and stepped behind a curtain , which seemed to cover the entrance into a smaller room , or an alcove . There was a sound of whispering ; a man 's voice and another woman 's  --  drowsy , faraway voices that spoke in a melodious rhythm , like a chant . The Arab woman returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said impassively . " I will make love to you for a little while . Then you must go home right away . It is late . I wish to sleep . " She leaned over Dr. Moss and pressed her lips to his bald , hot forehead . Then she reached down and began to caress him gently , unbuttoning his clothes and skimming his thighs with fingers light and adroit as a pianist 's . The touch of her hand , far from seeming crude or lascivious , gave the impression of a casual , serene spirituality . Dr. Moss closed his eyes again . He had never felt like this before . It was as though some stubborn , oppressive knot in his nervous system had been cut , and relief poured through him in a great cool rush . He felt the touch of the woman 's lips , and a marvelous lightness seized him and carried him up like a pair of wings . He lay afloat on a soft white cloud . As he wandered up the alley he was aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt in touch with humanity as never before  --  through his nerves and bloodstream , so to speak , rather than through the intellect . He felt lighter , more resilient in body than he had for years ; andp112at the same time aware of some continuous undercurrent of terror . It was the terror of a man standing at the edge of a pit , aware of some powerful tug drawing him toward the abyss . " I must go home , " he muttered , in a daze . He walked slowly toward the inn and knocked at the door.  |p113A  Negro slave appeared and led the sayyid and his guests through a labyrinth of passages to a long low room , dimly lit by the usual long-snouted oil lamps . A basin was set before David and Sylvia . They washed their hands silently . Then , imitating the sayyid , they crouched crosslegged around a large brass tray . Delicious odors began to filter through the air . " I must apologize , " said the sayyid wryly . " It will be a triflinglittle meal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must warn you , is rather simple . " Two elderly servants in white robes crept up silently , bearingthe dishes . The black boy lifted the lids . There were a bowl of hot milk and a symmetrical array of little wafers fried in oil . The sayyid kept glancing playfully at his guests . His presence dominated the room , tranquil and ponderous , with a subtle charm playing about him like the light of a candle . " Please , my dears , " he kept whispering . " Do n't expect Parisiancooking ! " Bowls of sweetmeats were brought , and a puree of dates and figs , and then an enormous kous-kous sprinkled with lamb and raisins , and presently a great dish of rice decorated with slices of sheep 's liver . Finally some peppered coffee appeared , and three types of tea . " Neither India nor China , " pleaded the sayyid , running his thumb around the cup . " A tea from Oman , a tea from Java , a tea from Iraq . Quite unimportant little teas , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangings coveredp114the walls except for the space over the doors , which was inscribedwith legends in Arabic . " Texts from the Koran , " said the sayyid , catching his eye . " And here and there a bit of poetry . I live on poetry . I am old , you see . Old and decrepit . So I meditate . I read . I memorize . You love poetry too , my friend ? " David smiled hesitantly . " A little . " " Ah . I see . " The sayyid leered . " You are young . You have more impetuous tastes . When you are old you will turn to poetry . Poetry , my friend , is like rain . It cools and strengthens and makes things grow . It softens the glare of reality . It draws us back into solitude . There are many kinds of poetry , of course . Poetry about flowers , about clouds . I prefer poetry about birds , as it happens . Especially nightingales . " A shadow passed over the sayyid 's smiling face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we need nowadays ! " He plucked at his ear impatiently . " Look around you , my friends . What do you see ? Nothing but people ! Everywhere , people . On the hills , in the valleys , thousands of people . Along the rivers and the sea , more and more people . There are far too many people ! Far too many cities in this world ! " His voice grew mellow again . " There are not enough legends for all these cities , you see . Each city must have its own little legend , its bird . Rome has an eagle . Cairo has an owl . London has a sparrow . Venice has a pigeon . Port Said , as you can imagine , has a horrid black vulture . " " And Kumra ? " said David tactfully . " Has Kumra a bird ? " The sayyid 's face grew wrinkled with pleasure . " Just a dull , clumsy bird ! " " What bird , Your Highness ? " The sayyid cackled with pride . " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You think I am most old-fashioned , I 'm afraid . Alas , it is true . When I was young I believed that the world was changing , that things were growingbetter and better . But now I have returned to the life of my ancestors . " He raised his long withered fingers . " You in the West ! Incurable optimists ! You think you can enter Arabia . You send scientists , explorers . You dig oil , you lay roads . But you have not entered Arabia , sir ! You will never enter the heart of Arabia ! You will cross our deserts like thieves and creep into our forbidden cities . But you will never find our secret ! " A look of fury was smoldering in the old man 's eyes . His lips tightened ; his chin began to quiver . His glance fell on Sylvia . His face melted again . His eyes twinkled . " And where , my dear lady , do you go from here ? " " To Aden , Your Highness . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be lucky , little lady , if you ever reach Aden ! " He leaned over confidentially . " The tribes are at war this week , unfortunately . They will remain at war for a whole season . They will shoot at you . They will rob you . They will massacre you . Do n't go to Aden , my dear lady . " Sylvia grew pale with alarm . " But we must get to Aden , Your Highness ! " The old man lowered his head . His eyes turned inward discreetly . " Must ! Must ! My dear mademoiselle , there is no such word as must ' in Arabia . " He clapped his hands ; the curtain parted . A servant appeared , a young dandy with henna-dyed hair and mincing gestures . He placed a parcel in Sylvia 's lap and another in David 's . " Open them now , please , " said the sayyid with a foxy look . They drew apart the orange paper . There was a silver stilettofor David , razor-edged , with a handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver necklace studded with turquoise . " These will protect you , perhaps . " The sayyid sighed . " Let us hope for the best . Will you be so kind as to visit the harim , my dear lady ? " The servant waited beside the door . Sylvia rose politely , fondling her necklace . She glanced at David with a flicker of apprehension . Then she followed the henna-haired dandy into the corridor.  |p116The  sayyid led the way into the adjoining room , a kind of loggia looking over the hills . It was a surprisingly modern room , with low divans and English sporting prints and shelves of leather-bound books . David glanced at the titles : Aurora Leigh , The Sorrows of Satan , Lady Ashville 's Revenge . " Sit down , " murmured the sayyid . " Would you like a cigar , my dear sir ? " David sank back on the divan and drew a cigar from the box . It gave out a dry , cinnamon-like odor . He glanced at the band  --  a golden ostrich engraved on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially for me ! Shipped from Bond Street ! " He smiled proudly , rolling an enormous bloodstone in the palm of his hand . " An English lord once told me one should always have cigarsfor a guest . I keep waiting and waiting for a guest who will smoke a cigar . Pray smoke ! " His fingers fluttered with joy . " You are the first guest in seven years , my dear sir , who smokes a cigar ! " He lapsed back , suddenly mournful . " Ah , here we sit , chatting . We chat of poetry and birds , we smoke cigars , we become friends , but alas ! we will never understand each other , I 'm afraid . " He sighed profoundly . " You come from a new world . I come from a lonely little old world . " The sweat was graduallywashing the kohl from his eyes . A large black pearl flowed down his cheek . " Sometimes , frankly , I feel full of miseryabout Arabia . Everything goes down the hill . The incense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squabble but do not fight . Valor declines . Wisdom declines . Only Islam still holds , but even Islam makes concessions , and I see nothing but muddle , muddle , muddle . " " There are worse things than muddle , perhaps ? " suggested David . " No . Nothing is worse than muddle , " snapped the sayyid.  |p117The  palace had sunk into stillness . Clouds of mosquitoes welled in through the lattices . A baby bat swooped into the room , darted about in a panic , and then shot out again . Somewherein the distance a child began to cry . The sayyid kept murmuring in low , monotonous tones . David 's mind strayed helplessly ; the old man 's sentences slid through the air and fell noiselessly to the floor , like withered leaves . Certain phrases recurred : " The soul of Arabia , " " the life of our ancestors " ; but their import grew more and more nebulous . The sayyid 's head sank forward . He had fallen asleep . David rose and looked through the window . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby cliffs , white as salt in the moonlight , and the moon itself , no more than a shred of light swathed in mist ; it seemed to be evaporating . There were dark hollows among the cliffs  --  the old caves where the shepherdsdwelt . A patch of firelight shone on the slopes . David stepped back from the window and tiptoed across the room . The sayyid was snoring . The cigar smoke was spiraling toward the ceiling . A long knife lay tucked into a bright red book . David glanced at the title  --  The Mysteries of Paris . He picked up a small jade elephant from the coffee table , held it against the light , and put it down again . Something , he knew , was going to happen . It might be an earthquake . Or merely a gnat biting his cheek . Or perhaps it would happen without his ever realizing it . But it would happen . Of that he was sure . A breath of wind stirred the shutters . A pink feather fell from the table , hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes opened hazily . He began to smile . The curtain billowed in the breeze as a door opened behind him . The servant came shuffling forth with a lantern . " Do n't be nervous , my dear young American , " said the sayyidimpenetrably . " Do n't be afraid in Kumra . You 're quite safe , I assure you . The young lady is waiting . Hamadullah will lead you home . Good night , my friend ! "  |p118A  boy servant in a green kufiya led Sylvia toward the harim . They passed through a little courtyard filled with birds in cages  --  parrots and parakeets , lovebirds , tiny birds no larger than dates , drowsy birds and frantic birds , dainty birds , dilapidatedbirds . One of them started clawing at the wires with a strangled look , crying , " Marhaba ! Marhaba ! " The passage turned abruptly ; they climbed a blue-tiled stairway . The boy raised a percale curtain , and they entered a large cool room . Bowls of light burned in the corners , casting a confidential glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ femininity . The ladies swam about like goldfish in the flamelit gloom , sparkling with brocade and anklets , three earrings dangling from each ear , and lime-green handkerchiefs tied over their heads . They gathered about Sylvia , whimpering faintly with surprise , spreading their painted fingertips with pleasure . Their monotonous black eyes shone like large , inquisitive beads . Some were beautiful as camellias , some were coarse and pock-marked , but all were somehow formalized into a crystallineprototype . They radiated the pure , impregnable essence of Woman . The heat was suffocating ; the floating odor was that of a beehive . Sylvia caught that wavering whiff of female power , so much older , more majestic , more intimidating than that of mere man . A middle-aged lady , powerfully built and matriarchal , emerged from the columns like an Assyrian priestess , wearing a red silk barracan and amber bracelets that clicked like castanets . " My name is Zubayda , " she announced in formidable tones.  |p119She  took Sylvia by the arm and led her to one of the cushions . Her long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small green fig into her mouth . She leaned closer , snapped her fingers , and poured out a cup of bitter coffee . " I am a poetess , " she declared . " The sayyid , you see , is rather drowsy . He needs to be soothed , invigorated . I recite three poems for the sayyid every day ! " " How very interesting , " said Sylvia . " He is a highly spiritual person . He prefers poems about death , " said the poetess with a piercing look . " Oh , really ? " said Sylvia anxiously . " Shall I recite a poem for you ? " demanded the poetess . " Please , " said Sylvia , lowering her eyes . The poetess leered at Sylvia . " A poem about love ? " she inquiredrather grimly . Sylvia blushed and nodded her head . " I shall recite you a poem by the great Yazid ibn Maqsam Assafadi . " The poetess groaned , lifting her chin , and her voice subsided into a wavelike rhythm . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dainty triangles . The poem rose and fell , the words wandering about like flotsamon the massive undulations of her voice . Her exquisite Renaissance face was pale , strong , elongated ; the damp curls falling over her forehead made her look more like a man than a woman . There was a tense , slightly intimidated silence when the poem ended . The room had darkened . Sylvia felt the eyes of the assembled ladies fixed upon her , the lamplight hovering in their great black pupils . A touch of panic seized her as she felt the touch of these probing eyes , nibbling away at her personlike a school of fish . " Very beautiful , " she said faintly . The poetess nodded . " But very sad . It concerns the cessation of love and the blowing of winds and the departure of birds and the coming of winter . You are going to Aden , mademoi-selle ? "  | " Yes , " said Sylvia . " I hope so ! " " Tsk , tsk , " said the poetess , stroking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Sylvia 's hand and gazed at her palm . Her brow grew furrowed . " You read the future ? " said Sylvia thinly . The poetess nodded , crooking her forefinger . " What do you see ? " " A bad , black journey , " said the poetess , tapping her chin . She leaned toward Sylvia , leveling her gaze . " Stay with us , mademoiselle ! " " I should like to , " said Sylvia uneasily . " I will teach you the poems of Nasr ibn Sayyar ! " " How very kind of you , " said Sylvia , quailing . " You will stay ? " cried the poetess , rattling her beads . " I must go to Aden , " pleaded Sylvia . The poetess reached out and touched Sylvia lightly on the arm ; her hard , hawklike eyes were swimming in tears . Outside there was the sound of footsteps clattering across the courtyard . A plate fell and crashed . A boy servant cried softly , and suddenly the birds started screaming , first the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green birds , all chirrupingin a panic of vituperation . The poetess glanced across the room , drew Sylvia suddenly closer , and in a swift beaklike motion pressed her lips to Sylvia 's cheek . " Good-by , my dear mademoiselle . " " Good-by , " said Sylvia . " Thank you for the poem ! " " It was nothing . Nothing at all , " said the poetess rigidly . " Good-by , good-by , " squealed the little ladies , gatheringabout in a flurry . Their voices tinkled along the corridor as Sylvia hurried back to the garden , where Hamadullah was waiting with his long blue lantern.  |p121The  following afternoon Dr. Moss visited the fortress . A selfappointedguide , a scrawny boy in a tattered fez , led him down the slope toward the western quarters . Here everything was squalor . An open sewer ran down the middle of the street . Thousands of cats prowled through the arches , dozed in the windows , leaped into the cellars  --  skeletal beasts , pink and yellow , with a sly , jaded air ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Egyptian tombs . " Here ! This way , Your Venerableness , " cried the boy in the fez . They crept over a bridge which crossed a moat , and scrambledup a flint-littered slope toward the fortress . Here the boy came to a halt , pointing proudly . There was a Himyaritic inscription on the wall , cut in massive strokes on the pockmarkedstone . It had to do , so it seemed , with a ceremonial visit by the Governor of Cana . Dr. Moss knelt down scrupulouslyand started copying it in his notebook . The sun shifted . Sweat was pouring down the doctor 's cheeks . He wiped his glasses , then drew his fingers over the stone . It felt curiously smooth and alive , like the hide of a beast . A ripple of gooseflesh ran down his back . Some fleeting innuendo from the past ? Something more eloquent than the tale of the governor 's visit ? There was a hint , in that Himyariticscrawl , of the impenetrability of the human mind ; and at the same time of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past centuries were still stirring under the hot wild sunlight.  |p122Dr  . Moss grew aware of a certain restlessness in the air . The boy in the fez tapped him on the shoulder . A crowd had gathered on the slope . An old cripple crept up and peered into the doctor 's eyes , muttering under his breath . Dr. Moss finished his transcription calmly . Then he tucked his notebook in his pocket and strolled back to the bridge . Someone came running up behind him and tugged at his coattails . It was the boy in the fez . " Your Venerableness ! The white haji wishes to see you ! " He took the doctor by the hand and led him in a roundaboutway , through a series of kasbah-like tunnels and up circuitousstairs , toward the crowded part of the town . Dr. Moss followed meekly . He felt listless and weary , depressed by a certain hostility in the atmosphere of Kumra . They came to a small cafe , similar to the one he had visited before . Was it the same one perhaps ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance parted , and they entered the leather-scented darkness . A group of bearded , hilarious elders were drinking coffee . There was a passageway on the left where a row of men lay sleeping on thick rush mats . He took off his sun-glasses and peered across the room . No one seemed to be looking at him , but he felt , rather uncomfortably , that he was being scrutinized . " Sit down , my dear Doctor . " A pudgy shape loomed over the table . Dr. Moss sank down on a cushion not far from the entrance . " I have asked you to come without delay . Please excuse me , " murmured Hirsch . His mouth played about in his sagging face like a fish caught in a net . His tiny pupils grew piercing . " It is a rather urgent matter , Doctor Moss . " Dr. Moss stared at his fingernails . " Yes ? What is it , Mr. Hirsch ? " " It has come to my attention  --  regrettable as it may seem , and even preposterous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are certain rumors current in Kumra . Well , not top123make too fine a point of it  --  " He pressed his thumbs together ; his gaze grew indulgent . " Certain rumors ? " said Dr. Moss , frowning slightly . " You must try to understand , my dear Doctor . These people are not accustomed to foreigners . You are the first in seven years to penetrate the walls of Kumra . There was the eminent Swedish archaeologist , Doctor Svensson , who unfortunately died of cholera here in Kumra . And several years before that Sir Basil Kennedy , the explorer , disappeared mysteriously in the outskirts . There is a suspicion among these people that foreigners bring misfortune to Kumra . Pure superstition , needlessto say . But traditions are powerful in this part of the world , Doctor Moss . " Dr. Moss tapped his knee impatiently . " Wo n't you come to the point , please , Mr. Hirsch ? " " Alas ! " Hirsch sighed . His eyelids flickered unhappily . " I wish there were a point . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that in Arabia . There is no black , there is no white . There is only a muddled , wearisome gray . " " You asked me to come , " snapped Dr. Moss . " Was it for a discourse on philosophy ? " Hirsch ran his tongue over his lips . A gleam of amusement lurked in his eyes . " Not quite , my dear Doctor . You must cultivate the art of patience , if I may make a suggestion . " He sank down on the cushion beside the doctor and ran his palm along the edge of the table . " A serious occasion like the present one deserves a certain flavor of decorum . The crises in life must not be handled too brusquely . One must not simplify ! As your own profession has undoubtedly taught you , Doctor Moss . " Dr. Moss sank back in his cushion . His attention was beginning to wander . The coffee drinkers were engrossed in a game of dice . The curtain tinkled ; a serving-boy appeared with a copper tray . A thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , almost ecstatic . He knelt down and poured the tea into the cup . Dr. Moss felt an esoteric un/dercurrent in the air , as though the men in the cafe were all members of a cult , engaged in some intricate ritual . " What are these ? " he inquired sulkily , pointing to a tray of pastries . " Maize biscuits . " Hirsch sighed . " And honeyed dates . Local delicacies . Please , please . " Dr. Moss sipped at his tea . The serving-boy tightened his tea-stained sash and stretched out his arm as he lifted the plate . A golden bracelet sparkled on his thin brown elbow . Under the bracelet Dr. Moss detecteda row of small pink abrasions , slightly swollen , like the bites of an insect . Hirsch folded his arms and leaned forward . His face looked suddenly venomous . " Doctor Moss , I feel I must inform you that you are in mortal danger . The people of Kumra do not like you . They are afraid of you . They have been watching you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are  --  how shall I put it ?  --  an evil spirit . A man possessed . A demon , in short . They are waiting for an omen  --  a sick goat , for example , or a case of epilepsy . When that omen occurs , Doctor Moss , they will in all probability  --  " He shrugged his shoulders and sighed compassionately . Dr. Moss felt strangely indolent . " They will do what , Mr. Hirsch ? " " They will kill you , " murmured Hirsch . " I see , " said Dr. Moss . " You are a man of character , Doctor Moss . I realize that the threat of death does not unduly disturb you . But I should add that these people occasionally seize on rather eccentric methods of capital punishment . There was the case of a young adulteress a year ago , for example  --  Well , I sha n't distressyou with the details . Doctor Moss , do me a personal favor ! " Dr. Moss raised his eyes to the ceiling . " What kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear man . How much cash do you have with you ? "  | " Two hundred and fifty American dollars , approximately , " said Dr. Moss . " Any jewels ? Or gold ? " " Nothing of consequence , " said the doctor crisply . " You 're quite sure ? " Dr. Moss pinched the tip of his nose rather thoughtfully . " A bit of jewelry would be very useful , " hinted Hirsch , lowering his voice . " Sapphires , for example . " " I have no sapphires , " said the doctor limply . " Well , think it over , Doctor Moss . Please bear in mind the importance of the occasion . My boy will accompany you back to the inn . I will expect you here at five . Bring me the dollars and the sapphires , and I shall arrange your immediate departure . I have no ulterior motives  --  not even charity , I 'm afraid . Merely a wish to avoid unpleasantness . " His lips curved in a cherubic smile . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think too badly of Kumra , my dear sir . They are fine people in their way . It is merely that they have certain deplorable prejudices ! " He rose and extended his wet pink hand . " Au revoir , DoctorMoss . I have , in my own way , thoroughly enjoyed our brief acquaintance . I regret that we have n't found time to converse on mellower topics ! " He waddled back to the corner where he had been sitting before . The game of dice continued . There was a clinking of coffee cups . A dry little man sat crouched in a corner with his jerd covering his chin . Dr. Moss gave a start . Those glittering foxy eyes : could it possibly be . . . The man turned quickly , whisking the jerd across his cheeks . The curtain over the doorway parted . The boy in the fez stood silhouetted against the light . He was beckoning gently to Dr. Moss.  |p126Sylvia  stepped through the raffia curtain into the garden of the serai . The fireflies were dancing their evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea-green air . All uneasinessvanished ; a gentle longing came over Sylvia , a nostalgiafocused neither on the past nor on the future but on some indeterminate point outside of time . A small owl started hooting in the direction of the mosque  --  some sort of sad , Arabianowl , with a sharp brassy voice . She tiptoed across the tiles . Idris was leaning over the edge of the pool , watching the goldfish . " Look , " he whispered , drawing Sylvia toward the pool with his long warm hand . " Do you see that little fish ? " " There ? Under the fern ? " Idris nodded . " That is a ghost fish , madame . Reach into the water and he vanishes ! " Sylvia dipped her fingers into the pool . The fish flicked his tail and was gone . Idris gazed at her teasingly . " You are a mischievous little madame ! " He leaned over and plunged his face in the water , then rose again , streaming . His teeth were flashing . " Tonight is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scooping the drops from his forehead . " She is the greatest ghost in Arabia . All other ghosts are afraid of her . Tonight is the night that she crosses over the deserts of the Hadhramaut , from Maida all the way to Ras Fartak and Salala . She walks backward , like every ghost , but faster than any ghost in Arabia , so fast that you see her for only a moment  --  first her back as shep127hurries toward you , and then her face as she hurries away again . All the other ghosts watch her from their secret hidingplaces . That is why the ghost fish is so nervous . He is frightened to death of the Queen of Yemen ! " " Do you really believe in ghosts , Idris ? " Idris looked shocked . " Believe in ghosts ? Certainly not , my dear madame . I believe in Allah , and in Mohammed his prophet ! " His voice sank to a whisper . " But ghosts exist all the same . It ca n't be helped . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised his hand and held it against the moon , which was shedding its silver scales on the far-off minaret . " We are all only ghosts , just helpless , worried ghosts . We were ghosts before we were born and were sprayed into our mothers ' wombs , and we are ghosts again after we die , frightened of the powerful phantoms . " He thrust his face close to Sylvia 's ; she caught the scent of his breath , sweet as milk . " You think you are looking at Idris , madame . But no . You do not see the real Idris . The real Idris is a ghost ; perhaps he is wandering over the sands of the Rub ' al Khali , perhaps he is floating in Qamr Bay . Who knows  --  perhaps he is up in the moon , or even in London ! Idris is far , far away . What you see is only a bit of skin and a lock of hair wrapped around a bone . The real Idris will visit you someday in your dreams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brows . " Would you like to see the Queen of Yemen ? " Sylvia nodded , tingling with pleasure . " Come with me , " said Idris . Crickets were singing down by the date palms at the bottom of the hill . Three lonely houses lay on the outskirts of the town , just beyond the fortress . Idris pointed . " Every house in Kumra has its own private ghost , " he said solemnly . " We Beduinknow all about them . Do you see that yellow house withp128the ibis horns ? It belongs to the widow of a former sayyid . It has a very distinguished ghost  --  a shriveled lady in a silver tobh , who sits in the kitchen with a harp . And that little house over there on the right has a fox who creeps into the beds  --  a very bothersome ghost , I think . And the lonely house with the blue windows  --  look at it carefully , little madame !  --  has the best ghost in Kumra  --  a sad young Ingliz who creeps about with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jol , cold and desolate , like a sea of salt . They came to a well-house at the edge of the desert . " You must sit here to see the ghost , " said Idris stealthily . The door of the well-house opened , and a wrinkled man with a cane stepped forth . Long gray locks fell to his shoulders ; wisps of hair grew from his nostrils . He was leading a nannygoat with a bell around her neck . He stepped back with alarm when he caught sight of Sylvia . Idris spoke to him soothingly . " Do n't be nervous , Salim . This is n't a ghost . It 's only a lady from the land of the Ingliz . She wo n't harm you . Do n't be frightened . " " Are you waiting to see the queen , by any chance ? " said Salim . " It could be , " fenced Idris . " Well , she passed an hour ago , " snapped Salim . " You 're quite sure ? " said Idris . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was early this year , I 'm afraid , " said Salim , sniffing . " Stay if you wish . Do n't let me discourage you . But I saw her whizzing by just an hour ago , as it happens . " Idris looked piqued . " What a pity . Good night , Salim ! " " Peace be with you , " cackled Salim and shuffled away through the sand . Sylvia sat on the step of the well-house and listened . The night was bubbling with little noises . Something  --  a lizard perhaps  --  was rustling in the jujube bush . Night-birds flitted about , small and velvety as bats . Some beduin had camped onp129the edge of the jol ; they lay scattered across the sand like eggshapedboulders . Was this a dream ? Squatting in the Arabian wilderness , waiting for ghosts ? Lost in a world of lizards and bats and superstitious beduin ? A rush of amazement passed through Sylvia , fanned out on the desert air . The whole world seemed suddenly quite fantastic ; not merely this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the whole universe , from the distant , half-remembered shores down to the crickets chirping among the palms . Idris plucked at her thumb . " There ! Look , little madame ! " A haze of light shone over the wadi . It swam indecisively , like a thread of yellow ribbon . It might have been smoke from a hidden fire or the glow from a swinging lantern . It passed behind the fortress and disappeared . " You saw her ? " Idris gasped . Sylvia stared wistfully at the distant walls . " It was the queen ! The murdered queen ! " Sylvia felt a pang of disenchantment . " Now you have seen an Arabian ghost ! " said Idris , triumphant . Sylvia gazed at him thoughtfully . " Thank you , Idris . It was a lovely ghost ! " They wandered silently into town . She followed Idris through the narrowing alleys , which now were completely unlit , unrecognizable . All of Kumra had gone to sleep . Even the cats had vanished . The iron stakes in the marketplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two empty jugs stood beside a sleeping donkey , and behind the donkey lay a sleeping child . It looked very thin and sickly . Sylvia knelt down and touched its cheek . She called , " Idris ! " No sign of Idris.  |p130Her  voice echoed across the marketplace , thin and bizarre , like the voice of a cricket . She drew a ring off her ring-finger and slid it into the palm of the sleeping child . Then she sauntered dreamily toward the serai.  |p131David  strolled over the tiles . A flurry of cloth lay tossed by the goldfish pool . He recognized Ahmed 's djellaba and a moment later he saw Ahmed himself , knee deep in the pool , splashing water up at his thighs . He called softly to David . " Sir ! Come ! I am bathing . " David knelt at the edge of the pool and sank his arms inthe cool black water . Ahmed grinned , covering his groin withone hand and splashing his belly with the other . " I could not sleep . " He sighed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sleep , a bit ? " " No ! It is late ! " said Ahmed darkly . " It is the night of the ghosts . All men should be asleep in their beds when the ghosts come flying ! " David sensed a new intimacy in Ahmed 's voice . A touch of playfulness ? Or anxiety , perhaps ? Ahmed stepped out of the pool , tossed his feet to shake off the drops , and flung his djellabaabout him . He squatted beside David , sniffing at the air . " Do you smell them ? " " The flowers ? " " No ! The ghosts ! " The spice of the vines hung heavy  --  and a more elusive fragrance , like wild cranberries . " The night is full of them , " confided Ahmed . He pointed toward the moon . " Even the moon is a ghost tonight . The soul of the Great Warrior has slipped into the moon . Let me tellp132you about the moon , sir , when it looks like this , shaped like a tusk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Women turn into witches . Men grow violent and murder other men . And do you know why ? Because the djinns have built their home up in the moon . " Ahmed leaned closer . " Even kind , gentle folk turn into traitors by moonlight . Even the beduin . Even the wise and experienced elderly beduin . " David glanced toward the west , where the top of the mosque gleamed over the innyard wall . The dome hung floating under the rain of stars like a phosphorescent umbrella . " Whom do you mean , Ahmed ? " said David quietly . Ahmed smiled . " When things are delicate , sir , we do not like to use names in Arabia . " He folded his arms and peered quizzically at David . " Are you waiting for the little madame ? " " Is she asleep , Ahmed ? " Ahmed smiled knowingly . " Have you seen her ? " Ahmed grinned . " Ah . You love the young madame ! " " I hardly know the young madame . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the elderly madame willed it before she died . She willed that you should marry the Ingliz lady . Is n't it true ? " " Of course not , Ahmed . " " Then you do not love her ? " " She is only a child  --  please , Ahmed . " " You are a strange man , Sir Daid , " said Ahmed , folding his arms around his belly . His eyes twinkled ironically . " You are a strong , beautiful man . You look like a warrior . You are frightened of nothing . But  --  forgive me , Sir Daid !  --  there is a ghost troubling your blood . You hide your soul behind a smile . Is that how it is in your country ? You smile to hide your loneliness ? " " You are a clever man , Ahmed . " " No , not clever . I am a bedu . I have traveled . " His eyesp133grew subtle . " Tell me , Sir Daid . Why is it that you are afraid of love ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? " " Love , " said Ahmed , " is everything ! Nothing else matters to the man who loves . The rest of the world does not matter , and only the kiss of the beloved matters . When you are in love , my beautiful sir , you would chop off your arm , you would walk through fire , or swim through the Gulf of Aden . All this you would do to win a kiss from your beloved . " " Have you ever felt like that , Ahmed ? " " Twice , sir . " Ahmed 's eyes flashed ; his lips were shining . " Once with a man and once with a woman . " He paused , waiting for David to ask a question . " Were you happy , Ahmed ? " " Ah , my admirable sir ! We must never look for happiness ; only for peace . Let me tell you exactly how it was with me . My love for the man was a hard , violent love , full of terror and jealousy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death very often . My love for the woman was a peaceful love , bringingstrength and self-forgetfulness . Love for a woman is like a flower . Love for a man is like a knife . " They sat silently for several minutes , looking at the slowrisingmoon . " Where is she ? " said David suddenly . " Ah ! With Idris , I think . " " Where , Ahmed ? Do you know ? " " By the well-house , maybe , " said Ahmed placidly . He grew pensive and added , " Or perhaps she has lost her way . Idris is such a careless , frivoling fellow ! " " Ahmed ! " " Sir ? " " Did you allow this ? " " It is nothing naughty , sir ! You misunderstand ! They are only waiting for the ghosts to pass . " David sprang across the garden and flung open the gate into the street.  |p134He  hurried through the marketplace , past the row of little shops , which were blind and bolted for the night . The whole town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alleys , groping her way through the filth and decay of Kumra . A light shone at the corner where the alley joined the walls of the town . An old man with a cane was hobbling up through the gate , leading a goat . David strode up and seized him by the arm . " Have you seen a young Ingliz lady ? " The goatherd stared at him with an empty gaze and shrieked , " Nasrani ! " David shot past him toward the gate . There was a grottolikecavity in the massive wall . A lamp shone dimly through a curtain of old burlap sacking which hung over the entrance . There was a bubbling of voices . David drew aside the curtain . Three young beduin sat crouched over a teapot which was gurgling softly above a brazier . " Has an Ingliz lady passed by here ? " The men turned and gaped at him . A glitter of alarm crept into their eyes . Their fingers slid slowly down toward their sashes . David dropped the burlap curtain and hurried around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was silhouettedon the brow of the hill . He called , " Sylvia ! Sylvia ! " His voice echoed back . He started to run . An iron lamp hung over a door ; under the lamp a boy was squatting . David touched him on the shoulder . He was pantingwith worry and exhaustion . " Did you see a lady pass by here ? An Ingliz lady ? "  |p135The  boy peered at him cunningly . He pointed to the door . " In there . She is waiting for you . " David found himself in a low-ceilinged passageway . There was a smell of slime-covered mortar . He heard the splashing of water directly below him . A winding stairway , completely dark except for a tiny flame tucked in a bowl of glass , led down into a rambling , soap-scented catacomb . A fat , female-breasted Negro knelt in front of a fire , fanning the coals . Steam was rising from a black octagonal basin . David felt the sweat beginning to run down his chest . The Negro waddled up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David 's garments , which he hung fastidiously on a rod in the wall . A row of futahs , jubbas , and kaftans hung from the other rods . Silver ornaments , bracelets , and talismans lay glistening on a stool beside the fire . David stood naked in the middle of the room . The stench of steam laden with sweat and camphor filled him with a suddenlanguor . He forgot why he had come here ; he forgot the whole outside world . He felt mesmerized almost , with fumes of steam circling around him . The Negro cast a towel over David 's shoulders and led him into the neighboring room.  |p136Sylvia  wandered on dreamily . The street took a familiar turn , and she looked for the brass-studded gate of the serai . But there was no gate , no serai  --  only a long black wall . She had lost her way , she now realized . Here the houses were of a drab dark mud , monotone , unlightened by whitewash . The city dissolved in a honeycomb of tunnels . She ran quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding along the base of a tower . Every house looked alike . Every window was black . Everywhere lurked that insistent odor of Kumra  --  half cinnamon , half excrement . A furious itching crept over her body , as though she 'd been lying in a bed of nettles . Arms , ankles , the base of her spine  --  what was wrong ? Had some insects slipped into her under-garments ? She glanced up . A light shone behind a battered curtain . Was someone beckoning ? She climbed the steps and entered a courtyard , hoping it might lead to the serai . A medieval lamp hung in a niche , under a pair of horns . She crossed the court toward a gate at the opposite end . Through the grillwork she could see the pattern of shadows : a ring of tiles , a tiny pool . She sighed with relief . It was the garden of the serai . She tugged at the gate , which squealed softly and swung open . The familiar fragrance fell about her  --  the mossy pool , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool and drew off the top of her dress . Carefully she cupped her hands in the water and let it trickle over her breast . The coolness brought relief . She dipped her face in the pool , feeling the clean fresh touch of the moss on her cheeks . When she looked up again the walls of the house seemed somehow blurred , unfamiliar . She crossed the garden . A small red lamp hung over a door , and above the door hung a little balcony . A shadow was stirring behind the latticework . Suddenly she realized she had made a blunder . This was not the serai after all ; and the very fact that the scene was so similarwas curiously unnerving to her . A slim young man in a pale gray cloak stepped out of the shadows and walked noiselessly past her , bowing gracefully . The light falling through the grill of the balcony cast a shadow over his cheeks . He had a scar over his eye , which gave him a frowning , piratical air . Black hair hung in wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen perhaps  --  but with an old , metallic glint . His face was leathery , almost black with the years of the desert . Had she seen him before ? In one of the shops ? Or maybe  --  ? He came to a halt and raised two fingers , about to speak . One of the shutters squeaked up on the balcony . He turned his head quickly and ducked it so that he was entirely in shadow . He was panting with excitement . " Why are you here ? " he said in a nasal tone , which might have been threatening or conciliatory . " I lost my way , " said Sylvia . " I thought  --  " " Where are you going ? " " I was looking for the serail " " You are alone ? " " Yes  --  well , no . I just happened to  --  " He looked at her furiously . " Go away now ! Quickly ! " He reached forward , about to touch her ; his long dark hand hung over her arm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His eyes were abnormally brilliant , piercing . She had never seen eyes so intensely black , so passionately alive . He mutteredsomething which she did not understand and hurried soundlessly through the pointed archway . Sylvia stood motionlessby the gate , touched by an inexplicable sense of loss ,  |p138of  something perilous and fiery floating out of her life . Should she call him back ? She might never see him again . She raised her arm . No . Too late . The garden was empty and still . He was gone forever . She hastened back to the gate . It had fallen shut . She tugged ; it would n't budge . Was it locked ? Who had locked it ? She called softly . No one answered . The house seemed deserted . Carefully she placed her feet in a coil of iron and started climbing over the gate . The gate shook under her weight and trapped her thumb in the hinge . She cried with pain ; a trickle of blood ran down her palm . Tears sprang to her eyes , but an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abandon . She crossed the garden and slid through the narrow black archway under the balcony . It was black , still , spicy with a mintlike fragrance in the corridor . It curved to the right and then divided , one branch leading into the dark , the other toward an open patio . She tiptoed along a colonnade of spiraling pillars , bright with mosaics under the filtered starlight . She halted , breathless . A paw of darkness slid over the walls of the loggia , then vanished . There was a tap-a-tap behind her , a stealthy tread , like an animal 's . She stepped into a nook of shadow and pressed her back against the wall . There was a stirring among the pillars ; the shape drew closer . She recognized him by instinct before she even saw his face  --  something in the grace of the walk , the flow of the pale gray garment . He walked past without seeing her ; she could have touched him as he passed . He ducked through a door at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recklessness which was more than curiosity , which was stronger than fear . She glanced behind , then stepped noiselessly through the columns and crossed the patio . She paused outside the door.  |p139Her  hand rested on the thick bronze doorknob ; it squirmed under her palm like a snail . She pressed softly . The door swung open . The room was dappled with the light of the moon , which fell through the latticework . Nothing moved ; it seemed empty except for some cushions which lay strewn on the floor . Then she caught sight of him , lying motionless in the dark . He 'd thrown off his djellaba , which lay crumpled on the tiles . One arm was flung out on the flagstones , the hand grasping a flake of moonlight . The rest of his bare body lay blurred by the mottled shadows . A curtain parted . Someone else stepped into the dark  --  a slender shape in a dark robe . A woman , could it be ? There was a low harsh muttering . The air grew alive , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaped to his feet . His shoulders shone in the light from the window ; his belly was sprinkled with flecks of brightness . A flash of panic shot through Sylvia . This was something she had sensed , had dreamed , had been told about but never dared to visualize  --  the phallic rush of the male . He looked slightly grotesque as he stood there , almost deformed . The dark barracanfell from the woman 's shoulders ; only a gauzelike sheath still clung to her . She looked luminescent and fragile beside the hard black bulk of the man . They stood for a moment face to face , without quite touching . Then he hurled his arms around her , and they sank to the floor . Sylvia pressed on the knob ; the door gave behind her . She stood in the doorway for one last moment , feverishly watchingthe lovers . There they lay , ensnarled in a monstrous little mazurka . She ran down the moonlit colonnade , through one door after another , and suddenly found herself in the narrow , illsmellingstreet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the soukh . Someone tapped her on the shoulder gently.  | " Idris ! Oh , Lord ! " He smiled dolefully . " Little madame ! " " Where have you been , Idris ? " " All over Kumral Looking for you ! " Sylvia 's lips began to quiver . " I lost my way , " she said hoarsely . " Madame , I was frightened ! The Queen of Yemen might have  --  " Two great tears rolled from her eyelashes . " Do n't be sad , little madame ! Now you are safe . Come home quickly . " She took his hand and nodded disconsolately . The alley dipped and then rose again . Idris kept gazing at her with his doelike eyes as they climbed the filth-littered flagstones.  |p141It  took a minute or two for David to grow used to the darkness of the hammam . Dark-skinned Arabs were sitting around the edge of the pool , lazily soaping their thighs , dangling their feet in the tepid water . The atmosphere was thick with steam . Nothing was distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the dark-skinned bodies  --  all were veiled , limbolike . A lamp hung dripping from the ceiling , lost in the clouds of steam . Everything was cracked and crumbling . Flakes of plaster hung from the wall . Great cockroaches went scurrying over the tiles . David sat down at the edge of the pool . The men around him seemed hardly aware of his presence , in spite of the fact that he was conspicuously blond in this assembly of blackhairednudities . The man next to him belched apologetically ; his paunch hung drooping like an enormous sack . The rest of the bathers  --  beige , bronze , chocolate , ecru , coffeecolored , most of them hideously fat or frighteningly thin , two or three of them superb as statues  --  all seemed lost in daydreams , lolling their heads , murmuring aimlessly . David began to see more clearly . A group of men lay sleeping on mattings laid out in an L-shaped alcove . Nearby , on a marble slab , some men were being massaged . Now and then someone emerged from behind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a groan into the milky water . A bowlegged boy ran up to David and began rubbing his back with a brush . He tugged at David 's arm . " Here ! This way , please ! " David followed him through the curtain into a room stillp142hotter , still more aromatic . A feeling of well-being was seepingthrough David , and at the same time a wave of repugnancethat bordered on nausea . Steam was rising in the center of the room from a little hole about the size of a saucer . An old man crouched on a ledge , pouring water over the bathers . David stepped closer . An enormous bowl was emptied over his head . He cried out ; it was cold as ice . His skin quivered with the shock . " Sir ! Over here , please ! " He dropped on the marble slab . A great jellyfish of a man poured amber oil over his body and started kneading his chest . He closed his eyes . He heard nothing but the rhythmicalpatter of flesh . The masseur 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balls . David 's nerves were meltingaway in a trickling stupor . His body lay spread like a harmonica into separate layers of sensation  --  arms , legs , shoulders , and hips , all lay floating in a sea of oil . The masseurturned him over and started slapping his buttocks . Waves of pain shot up his spine , spreading into a cool , bright relief . He felt his neck being ground , his thighs pinched and pounded . Finally he rose in a daze and groped his way through the alcove . " Here ! Lie down , sir . " He found himself in a kind of tunnel filled with couches . A row of small pear-shaped lanterns shone on the disarray of cushions , towels , and hashish pipes . The sea-blue light made the place seem vast and uncanny , blurring the contours , bringing a vibrancy to the motionless bodies . Most of the men were fast asleep ; some stared vacantly at the ceiling . In a nook at the farther end of the room could be seen , through a haze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . David listened : gasps of pain , sobs of hashish-ridden pleasure . A hand moved slowly up his back . He recoiled , terror-stricken . A man was kneeling on the bed beside him , a bird-faced man with a little beard and intelligent , glittering eyes  --  an Arab from the desert , wiry and lean-waisted , with thick gray feet , all callused , like an elephant 's . He flung his arms around David's waist with a grip of steel . David struck out in a rush of panic . The man shrank back , muttering , " Aya ! " Another man raised his head and started waving his arms . A thin little voice cried , " Faranchi ! Faranchi ! " David ran through the hammam , past the pool into the dressing-room . The Negro was squatting beside the fire , lazily fanning the embers . He stared blankly at David , then rose with a groan and whisked David 's clothes from the rod in the wall . Taurus and the Pleiades hung shining above the minaret . A haze of oyster-gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the distance , through the city gate , the thorn trees were already silhouetted against the east , but on the opposite side , where a caravan lay sleeping in a hay-strewn courtyard , all was black except for a row of water-bags , white and fleecy as sheep . Idris was waiting at the serai entrance , grave and sleepyeyed . " In the garden , sir  --  the little madame  --  " " Is she back ? " Idris nodded . She was sitting beside the pool , talking placidly to Ahmed . Ahmed glanced up as David approached , and dipped tactfullybehind the trees . " Sylvia ! Good God ! " She smiled innocently . " Where on earth have you been ? " " Looking at ghosts , my dear ! " He sank on the tiles beside her . She raised her finger , as though listening . What was it  --  a distant bell ? No , it was more like a faraway drum . Was the caravan gathering , per-haps ? Her forefinger fell on his wrist . " There . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Idris told me about it . The ghosts are hurrying back to their homes ! "  |p144He  took her hand . " Really , Sylvia  --  " " You think I am silly , do n't you , David ? " She pinched the air with her fingers as though she were squeezing a butterfly . A bird called  --  a wavering , plangent sound like a clarinet . She cocked her head , straining to catch the sound of the little night-bird . In this cool , swimming light she looked almost beautiful . Her cheeks were aglow . Her eyes were luminous , ecstatic . " Do you realize that you 've been extremely naughty , Syl-via ? " " Oh , David ! I 'm not a child any more . " " Sylvia , listen to me . " But she was n't listening . Her eyes shone with a secret triumph . " Kiss me , David ! " He leaned over and kissed her on the forehead , verylightly . She drew back and rose , drawing her fingertips over herforehead . " Sylvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my darling ! " She went floating across the garden with sly , glittering eyes.  |p145Clouds  of smoke filled the cafe . No lamps had been lit , and the only light was the haze seeping in from the soukh . " The haji is waiting , " said the boy with the teapot , lowering his blue eyelids and filling the cup for Dr. Moss . The rest of the drinkers , squatting on the cushions along the wall , turned their heads . Their eyes watched the newcomer with a sly , coppery glitter . A moment later Hirsch appeared , suave and ingratiating , wiping his brow . He loomed over the table like a Hindu idol , many-breasted , exuding a whiff of cloves . He smiled wistfullyas he counted the money , bill by bill , and tucked it into his shirt . " And the sapphires ? " he asked patiently . Dr. Moss placed a folded white handkerchief on the table . Hirsch opened the handkerchief , peered at the bracelet , and sighed augustly . " Thank you , my dear Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The caravan will conduct you to Raida . In Raida arrangements will be made for your trip to Mukalla . The ship calls at Mukalla in eight or nine days . Bon voyage ! " He stood in the doorway for a moment , gazing benevolently at Dr. Moss . His shirt clung to his chest , translucent with sweat . He waddled into the street and entered the soukh , where he soon was lost in the crowd of white-robed figures . Dr. Moss sat alone , staring dejectedly at the coffee drinkers . The glitter of eyes , bemused , narcoticized , shone like beads through the veil of smoke.  |p146Little  by little , as he sipped at his cup , he noticed a change coming over his senses . He could see everything in the room with abnormal exactitude . His brain worked with a strange new insight and clarity . He drained the cup and rose wearily . The eyes of the coffee-drinkers were fixed on him , watching his movements with a kind of mesmerized curiosity . He stepped through the door . Even the twilit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance , still faintly discernible through the scalloped roofs , hung poised in front of his eyes with a microscopic precision . He noticed a tiny ilb tree on a mound in the distance , just to the right of the fortress ; the web of branches was etched against the sky , sharp , minute as the blood vessels in an eyeball . The copper utensils spread out in the little stalls caught the light . The bolts of indigo cloth shone with a deep , rich stillness . Everything looked supple , lustrous , as though he had just set foot on a bright new planet . He felt a clutching expectancy , a deep inner animation . But outwardly , as he groped his way past the stalls , he seemed numb and helpless , almost robot-like . The scrawny boy in the fez came running behind him . " Here ! Here ! " He gestured fiercely . " This way , nasrani ! " Dr. Moss followed him down the alley . They crossed the market square toward the gate : first the boy , loping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walking rapidly , eyes glazed , head thrust forward . Some peasants were trotting along on their donkeys . The smell of ripening maize filled the arcade . Dr. Moss and his guide wandered down toward the caravan road , where the hoofmarks drew a pattern into the far-off sands , fine and clean as the pattern of birds ' feet . They walked into the hills and entered a rock-littered valleyand presently came to a crossroad . The boy in the fez pointed to the left  --  " To Ash Shihr ! " Then to the right  --  " To Raida . Here you wait for the caravan . " He paused , his eyes growing brittle , attentive . Finally he muttered , " Bakshish ! " Dr. Moss leaned closer . " What did you say ? " " One dollar , " said the boy . His voice grew rasping and ugly . Dr. Moss stared at him bitterly . " Go away , please . I have no more money . " The boy leered brazenly at the golden wristwatch . " Go away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand , faint with heat . His forehead was throbbing miserably . He reached toward his pocket for the aspirin , but even as his hand touched his pocket a great indifference came over him ; the presence or absence of pain seemed a matter of no consequence ; all that mattered was this great heaving brilliance which surrounded him , this acceleration of the senses which made the air seem electrical , which gave such a rainbowcoloredsplendor to the curving horizon , which gave to the desertstillness the grandeur and immanence of a symphony . He cocked his head and gazed at the sky . Three stars started twinkling . A sound of bleating rose from the shrubs on the other side of the valley . " Is it true what they say ? " said the boy , squatting in the sand , arms akimbo , making water in the Arab manner . " What do they say ? " " That you can change a man into a turtle . " " Sheer nonsense , " snapped the doctor . " Can you make gold ? Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I could ! " The boy stood up and tugged at the doctor 's sleeve . His eyes grew vicious with cunning . " You are a djinn , " he whispered . Dr. Moss shrugged his shoulders . " No . I am not . " " They all think so . Everyone in Kumra thinks you are a djinn ! "  | " They are mistaken . " " The men in the caravan will think you are a djinn , " said the boy . He opened his hand and stretched it meaningly toward the doctor . " No matter , " said the doctor casually . " They will not take you if you are a djinn . " " I am not a djinn ! " screamed Dr. Moss , flinging his arms in the air . The boy stared at him with sudden terror . He cried , " Sarra , sarra ! " and started running down the path , heading for the cliffs of Kumra . Dr. Moss watched him gravely  --  scamperingover the sands like a baby ostrich , growing smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark . The gravel along the edge of the jol changed its color . It looked blue and transparent , streaked with a furrowing white like a glacier . The lights of Kumra had vanished . The only light now was the gleam of the early stars and the soft , translucent afterglow of the desert . An air of sealike loneliness was cast over the dunes . There was no wind , no sound ; only a faint smell of sheep and the clean dead smell of the sun-baked gravel . Dr. Moss crept toward the jol . He moved as in a dream , lulled by the spaciousness and stillness . The glowing hues of the Arabian nightfall shone forth for a moment or two : the glowing violet of the eastern cliffs , the fierce maroon of the western plains , and over all the diaphanous half-light of the darkening sky . All around , east , west , the world of people sank into darkness . The smell of humanity died . Only the jol remained . Dr. Moss felt like a last survivor . A great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was everythinglost ? He stretched out his hand , clutching at a fistful of dry blue air . A sickening dizziness seized him ; he almost screamed . Something took him by the throat and sent him staggering across the gravel , lurching blindly , like a drunkard.  |p140But  then gradually he grew calm again . His mind was drained of confusion , as though a great clot had been washed through a funnel . He walked on carefully , making his way along the edge of the jol . Something in the sand suddenly caught his eye  --  a black splinter , like a chip of obsidian . He knelt and plucked it out of the sand . Curiously heavy , hard as a diamond  --  it looked like an arrowhead , whittled to a razor-like sharpness . It bore the unmistakable imprint of man . He pressed it to his lips , feeling the sharpness dig into his flesh . A tiny drop of blood trickled along his chin . He tucked the stone into his pocket and started strolling down the caravan road . An odd effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirrored some previous effect down to the last detail  --  rocks , hillocks , even the arc of the camels ' hoofprints . Several knolls rose in the south , pale , drab , thimbleshaped . A flurry of dry shrubbery dimmed the long plateau in the north . A stab of pain stung suddenly at the hollow between his ribs , as though someone had struck him in the solar plexus . He sank to the ground , gasping for breath . His eyes grew watery . For several minutes he lay quite still , waiting for the spasm to subside . It went as suddenly as it had come . He lay panting with relief . Then he got up again , bleary-eyed , and looked around for the road . Night had fallen . The edge of the Hadhramaut lay black , indistinguishable . He sauntered along aimlessly , looking for a familiar landmark . There was none . Even the cliffs of Kumra had slipped from the horizon . He decided to turn back and look for his footprints . Not a trace . They had died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he murmured . The moon was rising . A chilly light fell over the desert . He caught sight of two egg-shaped domes on the brink of a hill and started walking toward them . They were qubbas , holy tombs . He scanned the whitewashed walls , instinctively searching for the usual inscriptions . The place looked utterly neglected . Rocks and rubble were strewn around . Strips ofp150elaborate carving and scrollwork surrounded the windows ; but from close up they looked coarse and shabby . He entered the tomb on the right . Two small coffins white with dust lay side by side under a cobwebbed niche . Local saints , probably . He ran his hand along the top of a coffin . Relatively recent , he decided  --  a hundred years ; possibly less . He groped his way out through the open doorway and entered the smaller tomb , the one on the left.  |p151Sylvia  crossed the soukh , feeling the sunlight whip at her arms . She passed a stall in which some rice-cakes were sizzling away in a pan of grease . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the perpetual tang of urine and the sweeter , mellower aura of camel dung . She felt herself floating in an olfactory world . A dog came sniffing at her heels . She bent down to stroke its ears . But then she saw with disgust that its snout was seethingwith vermin . Two young women hurried past her , faces hidden under their veils , only their eyes black and sharp with antagonism . The seller of beads shrank back as she leaned over the stall . He started crying something that sounded like " Murra , murra ! " What was wrong ? Beneath the timelessness of Kumra somethingunusual was stirring . A pock-marked boy was fanning an old man who lay panting beside his corn bowls . Two small children were carrying a bucket of filth down the street . At that moment someone started to scream from the recesses of an alley . Sylvia stood motionless , fixing her eyes on the end of the street , where a tower stood perched on the city walls . A woman was standing motionless in front of the tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dress was long and black . A silver chain hung over her forehead . Her arms were rigid at her sides . There was an odd , somewhat sinister majestyin all that blackness and stillness . Suddenly she flung out one arm . Something flutteredp152under her robe . Was she beckoning ? Sylvia looked back uneasily . The woman in black kept on staring  --  neither at Sylvianor at the street nor at the walls ; not even into space . It was a stare without meaning in destination . The woman began to lumber toward the soukh , carrying a basket under her barracan . She started to pant uncontrollablyas she staggered up the alley . Once again she came to a halt , fingering the wall for support . Was she blind , perhaps ? She suddenly dropped her basket , and a bevy of figs went ripplingacross the pavement . Her mouth fell open in a noiselessshriek ; a rope of blood shot forth , streamed down over her breast . She keeled over and lay flat on the pavement , arms flung out , quaking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soukh seemed mysteriously deserted . No one appeared . Sylvia ran toward the dying woman . A voice behind her called , " Wait , madame ! Do n't touch her . " Idris came darting through a cafe doorway . He flung his scarf over his chin . A fig came rolling across the dust . " Here ! Quickly ! Come ! " He tugged at her arm and led her swiftly through the empty streets . The bell on the minaret kept ringing . On it rang , on and on , while the evening veiled the jol and the light on the faroffranges grew dusty . They were sitting on the roof of the inn , breathing the cool dry air  --  Sylvia and David and Idris , who was fingering his talisman . " There ! Do you see them ? " said Idris , pointing . A straggling procession was passing through the gate . The exodus had already begun . People were rushing to leave the city before the sayyid ordered the gates locked and the city quarantined . Hand in hand they wandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their shoulders , leading their children and donkeys . On the opposite side of the town , down by the fortress , they were chanting their prayers . A fire was burning in the little valley where the first of the corpsesp153were being burned . One by one the black bundles were dragged on ropes through the dust and then dropped over a ledge into the flames . The women prayed rhythmically , raisingand lowering their arms . The sound of their prayers was hoarse and monotonous , broken occasionally by a cry or a lamentation . A door opened behind them , and a tall pale figure stepped onto the roof . It was a moment before Sylvia recognized him ; he wore a jerd around the lower part of his face , covering his mouth and nostrils . " It is all arranged . The guards have been paid . We leave tonight , " said Ahmed . His voice was unusually solemn . David looked at him sternly . " Do they think we brought the plague to Kumra ? " " No , no , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell us the truth , please , Ahmed . " " We are quite safe , " pleaded Ahmed . " And the elderly sir ? " " He has fled . " " Fled ! " " He has gone on the caravan road to Raida , sir . He will join us in Mukalla . " He glanced at Idris uncomfortably . " He paid the haji . It is all arranged . " There was a troubled little silence . " Tell me , Ahmed , " said David carefully . " Who brought the plague to Kumra ? Do you know ? " " No one knows , " said Ahmed , blushing . " It might have come on the gibli from Africa , " hinted Idris . " It might have come in the sacks of incense shipped from the mountains , " suggested Ahmed . " In any case , " said Idris , " it is the will of God . " Ahmed nodded . " It is the fate of Kumra . " " How long will it last , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " When do we leave ? " " Two hours after sunset . " Ahmed 's face grew suddenlyp154cheerful . His hands danced busily . " Before the moon is high . Idris will fetch you . We meet the caravan by the southern gate . " " The caravan to Raida ? " Ahmed looked furtive . " No , the caravan to Raida left three hours ago . This is the caravan to Ash Shihr , which joins another caravan to Mukalla . There are many nice , dependablecaravans these days , " he added thoughtfully . He beckoned to Idris ; they stepped through the door , and three minutes later Sylvia saw them hurrying through the garden , laden with bundles . It was nearly dark . Sylvia sank back on the cushion and stared at the sky . A host of blackbirds went fluttering overhead , spreading and circling as they reached the fortress . They sank down and settled among the crannies and grew still . Five minutes later , when the gloom of the dusk had swallowed Kumra , the bats came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down over the roof , almost brushing Sylvia 's hair , casting quick little stains on the starlit tiles . " Are you worried ? " murmured Sylvia . " Not really , " said David , expressionless . " What will we do about Doctor Moss ? " " Poor old doctor , " said David dourly . " David , do you think  --  " " Let 's not think ! Let 's hope for the best . " " He 's such a helpless creature , David . " " Not so helpless as all that , my dear . I might as well tell you that he slipped Miss Todd 's sapphire bracelet out of my coat this afternoon while I was asleep . Ahmed saw him enteringmy room . " " Mercy ! How odd . But maybe Ahmed  --  " " I trust Ahmed completely . " " Well , I should n't have thought  --  "  | " He had his reasons , I 'm sure . Only I ca n't help wondering whether he 's been very far-sighted . But in any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? " He took her hand and pressed it to his cheeks . " How warm your hand is ! " He kissed it gently and gave it back to her . " Dear little Sylvia . We all become very wicked in Arabia , do n't we ? "  |p156Two  men lay in the qubba , fast asleep  --  an old man and a young man . Dr. Moss crept closer . The old one lay on his back , snoring . The young one lay with his face buried under his elbow , like a dog . Both had their djellabas spread out under them , the edges rolled into pillows . He could smell their flesh , furtive and musty  --  men from the wilderness . Should he wake them up ? Better not . He thought of lying down beside them . No ; no telling who they were  --  pious pilgrimsor dangerous brigands . Or maybe just beduin on their way to Raida . A spirit of cunning came over the doctor . He thought of searching their garments for a knife or a gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small black beard bobbed up and down , ruffled faintly by the sleeper 's breath . Dr. Moss felt soothed by a momentary sense of power . One slight gesture , one clutch of the thumbs on the gullet  --  He reached for his arrowhead  --  one sharp little jab at the jugular . A flash of lucidity came over him . He had cast off his past , he suddenly realized , like a worn-out garment ; and with it his habits , his values , his scruples . Through the low round door he could see the moon rising , the icy light touching the outspread fingers of the sleeping bedu . The old man 's eyelids began to flutter . He let out a groan , twisted his head , gaped at the doctor , and cried , " Mah-moud ! " The young man turned over on his back and sighed . The old man jabbed at his ribs . " Mahmoud ! Wake up ! "  | " I beg your pardon , " breathed Dr. Moss . " I hope I am not intruding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . He peered at Dr. Moss with a mingling of fear and calculation . Mahmoud belched drowsily . Suddenly he sensed the air of panic ; his hand shot to the knife in his belt , and he snarled at the doctor . " Who are you ? " " An innocent wayfarer , " pleaded the doctor . " You tried to kill us ! " squealed the man with the beard . " Not at all , " said the doctor primly . " I am waiting for the caravan to Raida , that 's all . " The men stared at him , incredulous . The old one whispered in the young one 's ear . The young one , a powerful thickset fellow , rose and groped his way through the tomb , lunged into the night , and disappeared . " Where did you send him ? " asked Dr. Moss . " To signal the caravan , " said the bedu . His manner had grown obsequious , fawning . For several minutes neither spoke . Dr. Moss felt calmer . The flush of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a dignity , a spirituality in the old man 's face . Or was he really so old ? The desert had withered and worn him ; he might really have been no more than the doctor 's own age . The moon sprayed its brightness through the door of the little qubba , and a feeling of subtle kinship crept over Dr. Moss , as though this bedu had something profoundly in common with himself  --  something elusive but fundamental , which only a difference of circumstances had veiled . The bedu leaned closer and tapped him on the shoulder . " Are you hungry ? " " Not much . " Dr. Moss sighed . Then he realized his lack of manners . " Certainly , " he said . " Thank you kindly . " The bedu pulled at his futah and drew out a slice of coalblackmeat . The whole tomb stank with the sickening smell of dried shark . " Here , " said the bedu , breaking the slice inp158half . Dr. Moss felt nauseated as he raised the fish to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flavor of decay flooded his tongue like an acid . He almost vomited as he forced the salty flakes down his throat . The bedu looked appeased . He stroked his beard . " Did you like it ? " " Delicious , " said the doctor , quailing . The bedu smiled noncommittally . " You look like a scholar , " he observed , watching the doctor from the corners of his eyes . " I can see it in your nose . All scholars have thin , thoughtful noses . I too am a scholar . Let us talk , " he purred , " about the glory of learning . " " Learning is an excellent thing , " said Dr. Moss wanly . " There are three kinds of learning , " declared the bedu with a ghost of a smile . " Yes ? What are they ? " asked the doctor , brightening . " Medicine , religion , and astronomy . The study of Men , of God , of the Stars . That is all . All other knowledge is vulgarand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glasses . There was something in the old man 's face that thrilled and fascinated him  --  as though the bedu had passed through every conceivable type of experience , as though his body and instinctsknew infinitely more than a man could know with his brains . The teeth shone brilliant . The small black eyes gleamed like a rattlesnake 's . Dr. Moss leaned forward , pressing his hands together tensely . " And there are three kinds of men , " continued the bedu , picking at his teeth . " What are they ? " said the doctor . " Men of fire , of water , of air . " The bedu sat back and grinned playfully at the doctor . " Men of fire are quarrelsome and brave  --  kings and heroes , for example . Men of water are astute and practical  --  merchants and the like . Men of air are spiritual , meditative  --  like you and me , shall we say . Mahmoud , unfortunately "  --  he sighed significantly  --  " is a man of fire . He is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Moss lay down on his back , limp with fatigue . He lay very still , feeling the pungency of the bedu 's nearness , sly and shifty and yet at the same time peaceful , harmonious . The stillness of the earth expanded beneath him , a stillness so intense that it seemed to palpitate  --  the panting of the globe , it might have been , slowly revolving on its axis . A strange excitement grew in him . He opened his eyes again ; the desert stars were shining into the qubba . All the enormity of the world seemed to lie concentrated like an essence in the little tomb . There was something familiar , reminiscent about the scene , as though he had caught a glimpse of it long ago , in early childhood . For the first time in his life he sensed the unraveling of destiny , the gradual fulfillment of a drama already plotted out to the last detail . The black sky , the white qubba , the darkness of the Arab 's face and the whiteness of his robe  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical.  | " This way , " said Idris , bright-eyed with excitement . He led David and Sylvia through a maze of alleys toward the southerngate , where Ahmed had promised to wait for them . The bells stopped ringing . The city was steeped in an evil hush . A smell of ammonia came seeping through the half-closed doors . There was a twitter of night-birds from an unlit garden ; a dog snarled , tugging viciously at a small wet parcel which lay festering in the gutter . " Let 's hope that we can pass through the gate ! " said Idris . They hurried across the empty soukh . A scrawny silhouette emerged from the shadow of the mosque and walked rapidly toward them . " Abdullillah ! " whispered Idris . He drew the other two quickly into the shade of a doorway . Abdullillah hurried past them , his parrot-like profile jutting forward , and darted into the alley which led toward the serai . " The scoundrel , " growled Idris . " Why ? What 's the matter ? " said David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Was it Abdullillah who  --  " " Ssh ! " said Idris . " Quick ! Before he runs to the sayyid ! " They waited for Abdullillah 's footsteps to die away , then hurried , almost running , toward the two blunt towers that rose on their left . They turned the corner toward the city gate . Two soldiers in turbans stepped from a barred enclosure . " The gate is closed ! " Idris paused . " A friend is waiting at the gate , " he said in a dull , tense voice . The soldier stared expressionlessly . " There is no one at the gate . "  |p161Idris  tried to brush past , but the soldier seized him by the arm and shook him gruffly . " Let me pass ! " snarled Idris . " I have a permit . " " No one passes except the dead . The city is locked . " " The sayyid has spoken for us , " said Idris , panting . He snatched a slip of green paper out from his sash and flashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little card , muttering uneasily . At that moment Ahmed came hurrying from the shadow of the gate . " Marhaba ! " he said firmly , rushing up to the guards . The soldiers glowered at him with sullen eyes . " Marhaba , " said the older one , stroking his chin suspiciously . Ahmed squeezed four little coins into the soldier 's hand . The soldier looked puzzled and wrinkled his nose . Ahmed signaled toward the walls , and the fugitives hurried through the gate , which creaked on its hinges as it opened through some invisible agency and then closed behind them again , bolting the rest of the world from the plague-stricken city . The caravan was waiting down by the edge of the wadi . Everything was rustling in a fever of preparation ; ropes were bound , bags were laden , bottles and kettles were tied to the camels ' tails . Ahmed had chosen the mounts with care  --  sturdy beduin camels , inured to thirst and ceaseless marching , as Ahmed explained , with cheeks aglimmer ; rather than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Ahmed , grew fussy and petulant in a crisis . A spare camel was brought along for the reserves of food and water . Disguises were produced for the fugitives : a pair of voluminouswhite pantaloons for David , covered by a long white shirt and girded with a dagger and a cartridge-belt . A white kufiya was wrapped around his head . " You must go barefoot , " insisted Ahmed . " No one must see that you are a faranchi. "  |p162For  Sylvia a pair of pale tight trousers was unfolded , and than a kufiya was cast over her shoulders , flapping loose over her head . A black handkerchief was tied over her hair , and a thick red scarf , a woolen hazaam , was wound tightly around her waist . " Where are we going ? " whispered Sylvia . " To Bir Ali , " said Ahmed . He added patiently , " And then to Suqa . And finally Mukalla . " " How long will it take , Ahmed ? " " Not long . " He smiled prankishly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clays to Suqa . Two more days to Mukalla . Nine days , mademoiselle . " " Nine more days ! But , Ahmed  --  " " Maybe less , " purred Ahmed . " Or maybe a trifle more . Still , it always seems to take nine days to Mukalla , no matter where we start from . " Now they were introduced to the caravan leaders , Hussein el-Hamri and Yusuf Qamish . " Bless you , " chirped Hussein el-Hamri , a plump little man with birdlike eyes . He mounted his camel , gasping nervously , and finally sat perched on a yellow box , pointing his rifle , his face half covered in the folds of his jerd . Two black Sudanese , gorilla-like men with sweet low voices , raised Sylvia and David gently aloft . The camels rose one by one . The caravan uncoiled . The six laden camels followed Hussein el-Hamri 's . There was a shuffling and tinkling as the camels stretched their legs . " Alura ! " cried Yusuf Qamish . Hussein waved . They started off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camels . Sylvia sat huddled under her cape , stirred by some supple exhilaration , breathingthe medley of spices that fluttered about her like gauze . Behind them rose Kumra , clifflike , intense . The limestone seemed alive in the brightening moonlight . Smoke was rising from an unseen hollow . A row of figures was passing along the edge of the wall . A quick stench assailed them as a gust of wind ran down from the fortress  --  burning flesh , burningp163bones . The bells were ringing again . A strange regret gnawed at Sylvia . It seemed cruel and sad , all of a sudden , to be leaving this godforsaken place , this city filled to the brink with decay . Finally Kumra was lost in the hills . The caravan turned westward , and they entered the sea-blue indifference of the jol.  |p164A  shadow blocked the door of the qubba . Dr. Moss turned his head . It was Mahmoud , the sturdy youlv bedu . His eyes were sparkling like glowworms in the darkness . " Are you ready ? " he whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look in Mahmoud 's eyes . " Come , " said Mahmoud quietly . Something in his tone made the doctor rise and step out into the open , where Mahmoudstood beckoning . " The men of the caravan are waiting , " he said , cocking his head toward the wadi , where the distant glow of a campfire was shining behind some rocks . They started down the slope , which was blocked halfway down by a row of boulders . Mahmoud slid rapidly across them , supple as a snake , but when the doctor tried to climb them he slipped and fell to the ground . A sharp pain struck at his instep . " Here , here , " growled Mahmoud . Dr. Moss limped after him , grinning with pain . The air in the wadi was heavy and stagnant . They stepped down over a ledge and walked along the dry basin , which crumpled under their feet into a fine black powder . In the distance he heard a high , flutelike sound . Once he thought he heard a man shouting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to wonder where Mahmoud was leading him . In some odd way the sensation of danger seemed to collide with and melt into the yearning for rest , for oblivion . They plowed through the dust of the wadi-bed , which welled about them in clouds , andp165climbed down a stairway of rocks which at rainy periods must have been a waterfall . A thicket of camel-thorn enclosed them . The air grew tight , laden . A hint of moisture rose from the depths of the waterfall . Mahmoud plucked at the doctor 's hand . They made their way along the side of the cliff and finally reached the bottom . Here the air was like an oven . Clouds of mosquitoes churned about . Dr. Moss felt his cheeks suddenly itching beyondendurance ; he tore at the flesh with his fingernails , snarlingwith impatience . They stepped through the tangle of withered shrubs and saw the firelight flashing among the rocks directly in front of them . Mahmoud halted and placed his hand on the doctor 's wrist . " Now , " he said , panting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten of them  --  had gathered around the fire . He could see them leaning closer , passing the hashish pipe . Three of the men rose up and began to dance  --  a primeval sort of jig , more African than Arabian . Himyaritic , perhaps , thought Dr. Moss , aglow with curiosity . He stepped closer . The dancers were almost naked , with bracelets flashing as they moved . Talismans jangled about their necks . Their eyes were glazed with narcotics . They might have been men , it occurred to the doctor , of the notoriousBa Qutmi tribe . One of the men began an incantation , swaying his hands like an orchestra conductor . Dr. Moss listened carefully ; it was a dialect that eluded him . All he grasped was the word " Ingliz " steadily recurring , and once or twice the word " nas-rani . " " Is this the caravan ? " said the doctor bleakly . Mahmoud nodded . " They are waiting for you . " " It does n't look like a caravan , " said the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulgently . " Come , " he said , tugging briskly at the doctor 's arm . The older tribesmen sat in a circle around the fire , shriveledas lizards , little fluffs of white hair shining around theirp166nipples . The three young dancers jerked their way back and forth in front of the flames , eyes burning under their lashes , torsos shimmering with oil . Dr. Moss , crouching behind a rock , began to tremble as he watched them . The old men were swaying , raising thin , rootlike fingers . They looked like old hags , dry-breasted and wispy-haired . A dreadful suspicion crept through the doctor 's brain . " Come , " said Mahmoud . " It is time . " Dr. Moss whispered , " No ! No ! " He tried feebly to break away . But Mahmoud 's grip was like iron . He forced the doctordown to the ground , twisting his elbow around his back until he cackled with pain . " Wait , wait ! " the doctor kept panting . " I have something to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow look . " Be my friend ! I will help you ! " " I am your friend , " said Mahmoud , expressionless . " Take me away . Take me back to Kumra ! " " They will tear you to pieces in Kumra . " Dr. Moss rose to his knees and clutched at Mahmoud 's arms . Tears welled from his eyes . " Please ! Help me ! " He pointed to his wristwatch . " I will give you this ! And many other things ! Pearls , diamonds ! Take me away ! " Mahmoud 's eyes were twinkling with amusement . " Are you afraid ? " Dr. Moss stared intently at Mahmoud 's dark , sensual face . He felt almost hypnotized by the animal beauty of the eyes . " No , " he said . " I am not afraid . " Merely saying it seemedto calm him . " They will kill you , " said Mahmoud gently . " You brought the Makhfi , and now they must kill you . " Dr. Moss looked emptily up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate you , " continued Mahmoud almostbeseechingly . " It is not hate that they feel . " He placed his hands on Dr. Moss 's wrist and cocked his head sideways . " You must forgive us , sir . We do this only to gratify the djinns. "  |p167Dr  . Moss whispered hoarsely , " Is it the will of Allah ? " Mahmoud lowered his eyes uneasily . " There is no God but Allah ! " said the doctor tensely . " Ah , that is true , " said Mahmoud , with guilty eyes . " But there are other spirits too , wicked sand djinns and water djinns . " " And you fear them ? " said the doctor . " Do n't be angry with us , " pleaded Mahmoud . " If we kill you it is not because we hate you . We do it to destroy the bad turtle-djinn who has crept inside you and spreads the sick-ness ! " Mahmoud 's face grew tense , agitated . Beads of sweat hung on his brow . He leaned over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rasping whisper . " Come  --  come . " Dr. Moss glanced around . He was barely conscious of Mahmoud'spresence . The air was rapidly cooling . Brilliant moonlightcovered the slopes in the west , which seemed coated with snow . The men by the fire were still dancing . The rhythm had quickened . The three youths were writhing about spasmodically . Suddenly one of them fell to the ground , foaming at the mouth . " Come ! " snarled Mahmoud . He jerked violently at the doctor'sarm , drawing him 1'p . Dr. Moss felt a surge of power run through his muscles , as though the hidden forces of a lifetime were suddenly being poured through a funnel . He tore his arm loose and sent two fingers spearing into Mahmoud 's eyes . The enormous Arab swayed , blubbered ; his arms struck wildly at the doctor 's face . The doctor ducked like a squirrel and jabbed his knee into the Arab 's groin . Mahmoud sank to the ground , doubled up , snapping for breath . Dr. Moss reached swiftly into his pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dug his fingernails into Mahmoud 's cheeks . An uncontrollable frenzy shook him . The stars shook , the desert quivered . He snarled with excitement as he hacked at Mahmoud'sneck with the arrowhead . Mahmoud squealed like ap168rat ; his teeth started chattering . He snatched at the air with both hands , then flung his head back with a muffled roar . Dr. Moss thrust one fist into the Arab 's mouth and , with the arrowhead in the other , slit the veins in his throat . Blood came bursting like a fountain . There was a hot , mossy odor . A great spasm shook Mahmoud ; his knees shot toward his chin and froze tight . His eyeballs rolled white as his breath gave out and his heart stopped beating . Then everything went limp . His young face , pale as a mask above its collar of blood , gazed at the sky with a look of cowlike indifference . Dr. Moss started running along the edge of the wadi.  |p169He  ran on and on . His brain was empty of thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon . The gravel rattled ; the wind went whining and stutteringamong the boulders . A small avalanche of sand went rolling down into the river-bed , sending a spray of snowy dust behind it . The ground gave way under his feet ; he leaped like a cat . Mosquitoes swept after him , cloud upon cloud . He climbed over a mound and stumbled on a broken twig , scrapinghis knee . " Oh , Lord , " he whispered . He glanced back , tense with an awareness of ambush , of hidden enemies lurkingamong the rocks . The moon winked through a cloud like an idiot 's eye . He rose and staggered across the hillock . Just below him was an ancient well-house , a derelict siqaya , half hidden by a growth of thorn trees . He half crawled , half rolled down the sandy slope and lurched into the shelter of the little hut . Everything was black here , water-scented . The coolness was wonderfully assuaging . He knelt by the well , which loomed below him , black and bottomless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He dipped his face in the well and lapped at the sweet thick water , which had a faint tang of coffee . He reached up and snatched the tube of aspirin from his pocket . The tablets crumbled between his fingers as he plucked them out . He scooped up the powderwith trembling hands and sprinkled it on his tongue , then leaned down and gulped greedily at the ink-black water . Finally he sank back and muttered , " There . At last . There 's nothing to worry about . " He was drenched in sweat . He tore off his coat and shirtp170and splashed his bony chest with water . The drops rolled heavily down his skin , cool as marbles . He began to shiver uncontrollably . " Am I sick ? " he wondered mechanically . " Malaria , could it be ? " And then abruptly he slid to the ground and fell asleep . Even before he opened his eyes he felt the presence of crisis . The smell , maybe ? Or the hush of : footfall , almost inaudible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that went arrowing through the dark and punctured the stillness of his slumber . He opened his eyes . For a moment he thought he was still in the qubba . Then he recognized the smell of the stale water in the siqaya . All was black . Only a thin slab of silver hung by the door . A crack of moonlight , it might have been . But it was n't ; he felt sure of it . He smelled the odor of blood-lust , thick and sullen , like the smell of iodine . The gleam of the knife crept closer , slow , patient as a snail . He caught the scent of a man 's breath . There was the stink of shark-meat . Now he knew who it was . He lay still as a stone . He closed his eyes for a moment , but then the terror was even greater . It was like falling into a snake-pit . He stared at the door , trying to see some trace of a silhouette . But the moon had gone again ; the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patch of shadow crouching in the deeper black of the hut , hardly stirring , yet intensely alive , hot , imminent . The old bedu crept closer . The doctor 's eyes grew blurred . The knife hung poised over his belly , scarcely three feet away . His brain shot into the air , piercing the sky like a hawk , until the earth seemed to glow beneath him , infinitely far away , small as an ember . On he swept , higher and higher , his great wing-beats bearing him on through the aisles of time . The knife fell . Dr. Moss gave a little cry . His body leaped and then sank again on the still cool sand.  |p173When  morning came they were crossing the hills that shielded the wadi from the south . Everything was drawn by the morninglight into a kind of hard , dead stillness . No life was left in the earth . On the mouse-gray rises lay scattered the shells of empty houses ; down in the hollows lay the mounds of long-deserted wells . Only a few miserable peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes like mummies , naked and dusty . Then the sun exploded . Everything shot into flames . The frozen stillness began to seethe . The sand seemed to flow in great cascades . Then that too died , and the desolation of total light fell over the scene . After the hills had been crossed the scenery grew baroque  --  no longer that smooth , clear deadness . There was a look of lawlessness , delinquency  --  ridges bitten by wind and sandstorm , crazy lumps of coagulated earth . Wandering shepherdessespeeked at the caravan through wisps of brushwood . " Look ! " cried Idris . " There it is ! " They had come to a siqaya . The little dome shone through the rocks like a thumb of snow . They halted . One by one they reached through the mud-wrought latticework and drank from the dipper , which was tied to the wall with an iron chain . It was the sweetest , coolest water that David had ever drunk  --  as though the crystal freshness of the night still lay concentrated in each drop . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads . They squealed with delight as the cold green beads ran down their spines . Character , habit , even the land/scape lay mirrored in their bodies . Ahmed 's body was tense and wiry , already a bit corroded by the desert . The older men were bowlegged , lean-shanked , sway-backed with the life of the caravans . Only Idris was straight and symmetrical , with hard thick breasts and arrowing belly curving toward the flat , smiling groin . They were all circumcised in the Moslem fashion , and most of them were almost hairless , but Yusuf Qamish was shaggy as an ox , speckled with tufts of blue-black hair . They lay and slept for several hours to break the heat of the day . Strips of burlap were soaked in water and draped like a marquee to shelter the sleepers . The land grew dented and craggy as they wandered westwardthrough the afternoon . The air grew cooler ; flowers shone among the blood-red gorges . There were tufts of fuzzy pink , like rhododendron , and sweet-smelling clusters of white , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arabs called batata : dragonflies went zooming from blossomto blossom on wings of lapis lazuli . " What is this flower ? " said David , pointing to a flower which looked like a blue nasturtium . " Tsk , tsk ! " cried Idris . " Do n't touch it ! It 's a wicked flower , Sir Daid . " " Is it poisonous ? " " It 's haunted ! " " Haunted by what , Idris ? " But Idris was n't listening . He had disappeared among the bushes , chasing a gold-spangled butterfly . " Ya bayya ! " called Ahmed . " Idris ! Come back ! " He turned to David confidentially . " Idris is a butterfly-brain , sir . Do not listen to his silliness . That flower is a nice , respectable flower . Even the camels eat it . " They halted in the shade of a gorge , and the beduin made a fire of dry camel-thorn . They set up their tent of goats ' hide and hung a blanket to cut off the wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sang to the sound of Yusuf Qamish 's little viol , which he called a rababa . And the Arabs , so incredibly patient on the road , so calm and tena- cious in hardship , now in the hours of leisure grew wanton and volatile . Ahmed started reciting ballads . Idris did a Javanesedance . One by one the men grew drowsy and disappeared behind the stones for a nap . And all the time David felt a curious stillness inside him . He spread out his fingers and watched the glow of the fire shine through the skin . " How strange it is ! " said Ahmed , his powerful eyes aglow with the firelight . " Yesterday we were in Kumra , surrounded by people . Today we are in the hills , surrounded by stones . Life is a wandering thing , is n't it ? " " You love wandering , do n't you , Ahmed ? " " Ah , yes , only wandering is real , " said the bedu . " To stay in one place becomes unreal . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Daid ! The stones and the wind and the flies , and this piece of broken rope , and my left arm itching  --  all that is real . But those hills beyond the jol are real too , only I do not see them . And Qamr Bay is real , though I do not see it . And Persia and Russia are real . Even London is real , I suppose . I must always keep on wandering or I forget that other places are real . The world is not real except for the man with a wandering heart . Just think ! Men are sittingthis very moment around a fire somewhere in Russia , or even London , listening to a rababa and watching the camels sleeping . " " You are happy to be a bedu ? " " Happy beyond all happiness ! " Ahmed looked at David absently and took David 's hand in his own . " We desert beduin possess the world . The desert is mine ! These cliffs are mine ! Even the stars are mine ! Our lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the city men  --  no shames , no worries . Why do men in the cities hide their lives , sir ? And pretend to be other than what they are ? Does it bring them happiness to hide ? I am a bedu and I do not think so . All we ask of a manp176in the desert is that he fight bravely against his enemies , be generous and loyal , abide by Islam , and love fine horses . All else is trivial . Let him make love as he wishes . Let him dress as he wishes and kill as he wishes . A man is a man . All men are forgiven , except he who is frightened of his own true self . Such a man is empty and false . Little by little he turns into a ghost ! " There was silence for several minutes . Ahmed gazed into the coals . He had never spoken as much as this . David felt touched , vaguely honored . The firelight accentuated the bedu 's expression  --  the fervor , the poise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahmed turned to David . " Why did you come to Arabia , sir ? " " You know why I came , Ahmed . A plane fell out of the sky , and I was in it ! " " Yes , yes , " said Ahmed , frowning impatiently . " But there was a reason behind it . It was destined that you come to Arabia . The falling plane was just an excuse . There was some reason in your soul that made you come to Arabia ! " " You think that everything in our lives is destined , Ahmed ? " " Mm . " Ahmed smiled . " Every hair on our heads . " " Then we are helpless ? " " Oh ! Utterly ! " " Then why do we struggle ? " " We are destined to struggle ! Always and forever , Sir Daid . It is the will of Allah . " The last of the flames were dancing in the boughs of camelthorn . Sylvia climbed over the stones and curled up next to David . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wrist with her forefinger . " What do you see there , darling ? " David stared . " I see horses galloping over the sand . "  | " I see a humming-bird fluttering , I think . " " And now I see a fox crawling under a fence . " " Look . There 's a snake climbing a tree . " David tossed a pebble into the fire . " We 're turning into children , are n't we ? " " No , no , " said Sylvia , looking mischievous . " We 're turning into Arabs ! " She glanced at her toes , which were red and swollen with the long day 's journey . " Tell me , darling , " she murmured . " Do you think you 'll ever fall in love ? " " I try to love everyone a little , " said David . " That 's more sensible , do n't you think ? " " Is it ? " Sylvia sighed . " Do you really think so ? " She poked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David with great , beseeching eyes . " Am I very ugly , David ? " " You are very pretty , Sylvia . You have beautiful eyes . " Sylvia shook her head miserably . " No , no . I know better . I 'm dreadfully plain . Look . My mouth is too big . I 'm bony and scrawny . My hair is all in a tangle . No one will ever fall in love with me . " " Do n't be impatient . You 're still very young , my dear . " " I 'm not a child , David . I 'm a woman ! Listen , I already  --  " She blushed ; then she whispered , " David , tell me . Do youthink you 'd ever want to sleep with me ? " David looked at her quickly . " Someday maybe ? When I 'm less homely ? " " What would you like me to say ? " She tossed her head . " I do n't care ! " " Then why do you ask ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her eyes flashed . " I know what you think . You think I 'm a virgin ! " " You 're not a virgin ? " " Certainly not ! " A creeping tenderness rose up in David . " Listen , Sylvia . I have something to tell you , " he began . But at that moment Yusuf Qamish came rushing up to them , waving a blanket.  | " What 's wrong , Yusuf Qamish ? " Yusuf Qamish looked agitated . " Bandits , sir ! From Raida . " " Where ? " Yusuf waved toward the north . " Who saw them ? " " Ismael ! " Ismael was the cook of the caravan , a leathery old man with eyes like a salamander 's , which he closed by raising the bottomlids . The camels were growing restless ; they sensed the alarm in the air . " Come , " cried Ismael , scurrying about to gather the pots and kettles . " Kill the fire and let 's leave . One more hour and we 'll be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off through the dawn for Bir Ali.  |p179In  Bir Ali the vines were already in flower . Blossoms clung to the foliage like great azure butterflies . Under the boughs seethed the honey-bees in a golden cloud . Off in the east the old shepherds sat crouched on the rocks , gnawing away at strips of bark , small gray beards fluttering wispily . Naked boys were playing leap-frog under the date palms . The caravan passed an old cemetery . Small pink tombstones , cracked by centuries , were sprinkled at random behind a well  --  medieval warriors , said Yusuf , who had been buried as they fell in battle . They arrived at the inn , which was surprisingly pleasant and hospitable . They entered the gate , and the camels were led to the camel court . The guests were ushered into the shady wing of the serai . Carpets and cushions had already been put out for the unknown visitors . It was late , almost dusk , but the cook went scampering down to the kitchen , and soon the delicious odor of barbecue welled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a little room hung with curtains . A hooknosedservant brought an oil lamp , trimmed the wick with her fingers . A tongue of light shot from the snout ; suddenly the night closed in . " I am Jamila , " said the maid , rolling her ostrich-like eyes . She flung open a door into a hexagonal patio . Sylvia caught the hard , brisk scent of Arabian vegetation . Jamila came up beside Sylvia and carefully drew off her clothes , and Sylvia stepped into the pool , which was tiled in black , no larger than a bathtub . A glow of well-being passed through herp180nerves . The water slid over her skin ; the ache and the wearinesswere gone . A cymbal sounded  --  dinnertime . The servant led her back through the patio , and she entered a long cool room covered with rugs and cushions . David was waiting for her , freshly bathed and barbered . Hussein and Yusuf Qamish bowed solemnly ; they were wearing clean white kufiyas . They dipped their fingers in a copper basin and moved toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood on a bowlegged table  --  a giant kous-kous seasoned with sugar , almonds , figs , and raisins . They ate with quick , gingeiy gestures , dipping their fingers in the kous-kous and rolling the grains into yellowballs , grunting and belching politely . A curtain parted . An impressive personage walked slowly into the room  --  some sort of sayyid , perhaps , or a village dignitary . To Sylvia he looked magnificent and terrifying , with his shaggy beard and flashing amulets and wild , libidinous eyes . A whole sheep , freshly roasted , was ushered into the room and laid on a circular mat among bowls of rice . Platters of dates dipped in butter were passed around , and a succulent silence fell on the guests . The smoke from the oil lamps grew thicker . Sylvia felt vaguely drugged . Footsteps rustled outside the window  --  the townsmen were gathering for a dance , apparently . " A war dance , " said the local dignitary . " Bir Ali is famous for its warriors ! " A copper ewer of tea was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . Yusuf Qamish praised the figs . The local dignitary spoke in favor of aristocracy . Hus sein el-Hamri condemned the Turks , the French , and the Jews . Then Yusuf Qamish praised poetry . The dignitary spoke in favor of nightingales . Hussein el-Hamri condemned tobacco , homosexuality , and communism . The dignitary dis-agreed , dipping an almond cake in his teacup . Communism was deplorable , tobacco was unclean , but sodomy was a blessingto women , who would otherwise be in a perpetual state of pregnancy . Yusuf Qamish replied with a discourse onp181imsak  --  imsak being the Arab technique of contraception , the retention of semen by the male during the orgasm . The dignitary spoke airily in favor of chastity and decorum . Husseinel-Hamri ended by roundly denouncing the Egyptians , the Lebanese , and the Abyssinians  --  the first for their venality , the second for their ugliness , the third for their lack of personal hygiene . Sylvia sat listening , wide-eyed . She hardly understood what the men were saying . Their low , unscrupulous voices were like an incantation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footsteps , the glittering eyes of the bearded dignitary  --  she felt trapped in a shaggy , carnivorous world of males . A musket went off . Shouts rose from the village soukh . The dance finally began to the sound of chanting and strumming . Fireworks flashed over the date palms , and the scent of gunpowderseeped through the latticework , mingling with the cozy fumes of roast mutton and incense . Sylvia returned to her room , feeling slightly dizzy . A curtain had been drawn aside in the alcove , revealing an old brass bedstead of equivocal European origin , draped with disintegrating tulle and a spray of artificial rosebuds . Jamila smiled with a dainty pride as she drew off the coverlets . A Venetian mirror , cracked through the middle , hung in a small green niche . Jamila vanished . Sylvia gazed intently at the mirror . She was shocked by the change . Her face was dark with the sun , like an Arab boy 's . Her cheeks were bolder , her mouth firmer , her eyes deeper and more alert . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nipples . A sting of yearning shot through her , spreading puckers of goosefleshacross her back . She was passing through a menstrual period ; a depressing indolence took hold of her suddenly ; she sank onto the bed and buried her face in the pillow . Something brushed her thighs lightly , like a silken thread . She glanced down . A small object had lit on her belly , bluep182and furry , like a cornflower . It stirred , leaped suddenly  --  an enormous spider . She jumped up and seized the cushion . She saw that the bed was alive with spiders ; they were lurking in every fold ; they came popping like corks from the satin coverlet . She screamed . " Jamila ! " The lamp swayed , the shadows shifted , and she saw that the walls were seething with vermin , spiders and centipedes hanging in garlands from the crumbling plaster . She shook with panic . " Jamila ! Jamila ! " Jamila ran in from the patio , hands fluttering . Sylvia was staring at the walls , speechless with horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shawl over Sylvia 's shoulders . " Do n't be upset , madame . They wo n't bite you . " She picked up a spider and looked at it tenderly . " They bring luck ! They protectyou ! They are the souls of earlier wanderers who have stayed in the inn . " She led Sylvia to another room , which gave out on an oval courtyard . A brand-new room , explained Jamila . No wanderershad ever slept here . She sighed reproachfully . " No souls to protect you ! Sleep peacefully , madame . " Outside Sylvia 's window , the click-click of the dominoplayerskept her awake . Somewhere in a distant part of the inn there was the scraping of records on a worn-out phonograph . Outside the window the vines looked white and thin , bending in the wind . A bearded man stood under the tree , making water against the wall . She lay down in the bed , filled with terror  --  not of spiders this time , but of something mightier , more immanent . The room revolved like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange rigidity possessed her . She longed to cry , but the sound clung to her throat . Nausea rose up in her in gradual , peristaltic waves . She jumped out of her bed , raced into the courtyard , and vomited . She knelt in a corner of the patio , feeble and bleary-eyed . The world had splintered into triangles like a broken mirror.  |p183Nothing  made sense . The frame had crumbled . The future and past were nothing but fog , through which the present loomed indistinctly , like a fluttering scarecrow . She cried softly , " David ! " A bat came dipping out of the roof . She fell asleep without warning , sprawled out on the urine-scented flagstones . Once she woke up for a moment or two . The air had cooled ; leaves were rustling . A boy in a futah leaned over her , touching her forehead lightly . " Mallalah , " he whispered , and ran his fingers over her belly . Then he whispered something else , which sounded like , " Sadra ! Sadra ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following morning she woke up in the arms of Ahmed , who was carrying her back into her room . Her malaise had gone ; she felt cool and refreshed . Through her latticed window she could see the village soukh , already crowded with the bustle of caravans . Bearded men with the appraising , wistfullook of far horizons stood about in solemn groups . Laden camels were barking from the camel courts , eager to be off . In the middle of the soukh sat a juggler in a green kimono , tossing knives . An old snake-charmer was unraveling the snakes from his basket and plunging their heads into his mouth like a row of cigars . Cocks were crowing , dogs were yelping , a flurry of blackbirds swung over the cornfields . Sunlight fell on the dome of the mosque . The muezzin called . The Arabian day had begun with a shrill , clownish cheerfulness . Jamila came to take Sylvia for a visit to the harim . It was a modest little harim , much smaller than the one inp184Kumra . The ladies sat by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor were cheerful and opulentlydressed , tinkling with necklaces of silver , trailing feathersof perfume ; those out of favor had lapsed into a kind of slovenly dejection . An elderly sherifa , an aunt of the sayyid 's , opened a large straw trunk and drew out a cataract of dry , wrinkled satins . " Have you brought us gifts ? " cooed the sherifa . Sylvia blushed . " No . Forgive me . " " Little bottles ? Full of smells ? " " I 'm dreadfully sorry , " pleaded Sylvia . She drew off her silver bracelet and dropped it into the sherifa 's palm . There was a hum of appreciation . The sherifa reached into the trunk and chose a gift in return  --  a long purplecape with gold-braided sleeves . A young woman with beady eyes sidled up casually and ran her fingers along Sylvia'sarms , patted her buttocks , pinched her nipples . She shook her head disapprovingly . " Hard ! Thin ! Like a boy ! " The shriveled sherifa flung the cape over Sylvia 's shoulders . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tiny fingers . She plucked at a row of multi-colored beads along the collar . " Green , " she chirped . " Green is for courage . Yellow for joy . White for innocence . Black for patience . Red for desire . And gold for pride . You will need all of them , my child . All of them ! " " Thank you , madame , " said Sylvia , bashful . The sherifa gazed at Sylvia searchingly , cocking her head . " You are unwell , mademoiselle , " she whispered . Sylvia looked away quickly . " It 's been a difficult journey , I 'm afraid . " " You have been too much with men , " said the sherifa , pursingher lips . " You have lost your delicacy . Your beauty . " " I was never beautiful , " said Sylvia , sad-eyed . The sherifa ruffled her shawl . " My dear child , " she began . Her eyes were hard and greedy , like a magpie 's . A bell tinkled ; Jamila ran up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The camels were strolling through the archway . " Farewell ! " cried Sylvia , raising the thick white curtain from the doorway . The sherifa stared at her with melting eyes and nodded swiftly , three times.  | " This way , " said Yusuf Qamish , " takes six days to Mukalla . We go down the wadi south of the hills . It is not long . The land is peaceful . " " And the other way ? " said David . " Five days only . But the land is troubled . " " Bandits ? " " No . Not exactly . " " Hostile tribes ? " Yusuf leered . " Go the peaceful way , sir , and pay the men for an extra day . " " How much do we pay for five days ? " " Thirty thalers . Three for each man and ten for the food . " " We will pay them in Mukalla , I suppose ? " " They are nervous . They want it now . " " I have no thalers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go . " There was only one thing to do . " I have some pearls , Yusuf Qamish . Will you buy them from me ? " " Let me see the pearls , " said Yusuf Qamish . David opened the pigskin case . There were forty-four pearls on the chain . He broke the chain and drew off one , two , three little pearls . Yusuf Qamish smiled disparagingly . " I am sorry , sir . Three pearls are nothing . A pearl is worth three thalers in this part of the world . Not a penny more . " David drew off seven more pearls . " Thirty thalers , " he said . " And how do we go ? The peaceful way ? " said Yusuf Qamish.  | " Come . We are leaving , " said David angrily , beckoning to Ahmed . " Go the troubled way if you wish . We want to get to Mukalla . " The gazelles down in the wadi were almost tame , gazing limpidly at the passing caravan . A flock of sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveyingthe roving flocks . They called out merrily to the travelersand began to play on their pipes . Long after they had vanished the sound of their pipes still hung in the air , lonely and unanswerable , like a cry of longing . A deep gully ran through the foothills , and in it a thread of water moved lazily , pausing in cherry-red pools , gurgling and trickling into the shadows . A wooden bridge bound with rope spanned the gully . First Ahmed crossed , stepping gingerlyover the planks . Then came the first camel . It paused at the edge with an insulted air , then crossed , raising its hoofs like a ballet dancer . Then the rest of the camels crossed , never more than one at a time . One of them stumbled  --  aweary old naga . A water-bag broke from its halter and fell into the gully . The planks swayed and creaked ; the ropes crackled ominously . Finally David and Sylvia crossed with Idris on foot , and the empty bridge rocked behind them in a haze of dust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Oman . The older , wealthier men were jogging along on donkeys . The young ones walked barefooted , tugging at their umbrellas in the fitful wind . A group of Negroes followed the procession , husky fellows who had crossed from Massawa on sailing boats , brisk and smiling in contrast to the grim , fanaticalArabs . " Keif halak , " they muttered as they passed , nodding their enormous heads . Some carried heavy-handled swords of the type carried by the Crusaders ; others wore little daggers strapped to theirp288biceps . More and more of the pilgrims gathered , hundreds and hundreds , and finally they came to a halt at the edge of the gully . They trod their way over the sandstone , which blazed in the sun , bright as topaz . A sacrificial feast was preparedin the shade of the cliffs , and soon the rocks were spatteredwith the blood of the goats . Hearths were hastily built , rings of stone filled with charcoal , and over the embers stones were laid on which the meat began to sizzle . Columns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosariesand chewing bitter myrrh , to prepare their stomachs for the heavy feast . They sat on cushions of sheepskin , while the naked butchers skipped about , brandishing their knives , their bellies dappled with sprays of blood . The prayers began to rise . " Allah ilia Allahi . . . " Three silver planes passed overhead through the glare of blue . Strangely powerful they looked , more real and yet at the same time more dreamlike than the land below and the praying Mohammedans . One shaggy-browed man shook his fist toward the sky . " What is he saying ? " inquired David . " Some sort of curse , " said Ahmed casually . " Floods . Hurricanes . Explosions . The usual sort of thing . " " Against us all ? " " No , no . " Ahmed grinned . " Only against the land of the evil bird-men ! " Two hours later an ugly wind was creeping up from the south . Slowly they felt it drawing closer , its power still hidden , its fury muted . The sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust sprayed over the dunes . Then they heard it  --  a delicate whine , which broadened into a dull , hoarse rumble . The air grew stale and nerveless ; the heat smelled like potassium . A wall of dust enclosed them , and the men flung shawls over their faces . The path dipped ,  |p189and  they entered a valley , and the wind went galloping off to the north . A young Arab rode over the dunes , a black filly loping behind him . " Keif halak ! " cried the caravan . " Taiyib , Taiyib , " replied the rider and halted his horse beside Hussein , who kept glancing nervously at Yusuf Qamish . It was a lovely Arabian mare with bloodshot eyes , flanks matted with sweat and nostrils distended . The little filly kept prancing about with sudden , uncertain curvets . A falcon sat on the rider 's wrist , feathers shabby and frayed , with a bloodthirstylook in its wild , hacking eyes . It rocked gently as it sat there , head thrust forward , beak clenched , but something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rider and his bird . " What is its name ? " said Ahmed . " Zurayda , " whispered the rider , his face lit up by a huge , sweet smile . He looked like a dandy as he sat there in his high-pommeledsaddle , which was decorated with tassels and tanned with mimosa ; the one black rein hung loose from his outspreadfingers . He wore a camel 's hair cloak over his cool silken dress ; his eyelids were painted dark blue , and a heavy scent spread from his body . A rifle swung negligently over his chest . He frowned and whispered to Ahmed . " He wants us to follow , " said Ahmed dourly . There was an uneasy consultation between Hussein and Yusuf Qamish . Then Hussein nodded , and the caravan curved to the north , following the rider . The tribesmen sat in a circle , smoking their tribal pipes . Ismael came up and placed a basin of camel 's milk besidep190them , and then a bowl of barley and a kettle of tea . The tribesmen began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whom did you meet on the way ? " said one . " What is the news from Ash Shihr ? " said another . A third said , " What is the price of dates in Mukalla ? And of silk in Mocha ? Do you happen to know ? " Two bedu girls sat plaiting the young men 's hair , which hung down to their nipples , bright and powerful . It was beingwashed in camel 's urine and oiled with sheep butter and then spiced with mercury , to kill the lice . They were incrediblyvain , these young men , sprinkling their bodies with incense and rubbing powdered antimony over their eyes . It was the girls who were fresh and stalwart , the men who were puffed up like turkey-cocks . Finally the bargaining began . The tribesmen wanted gold . They had no gold , said Hussein obsequiously . Silver , then , insisted the tribesmen . Ninety thalers , and they could continue . Hussein quivered with humility . Ninety thalers ! What did they imagine ? This was a poor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver , not even silks or incense . What did they have ? inquired the tribesmen darkly . The price must be paid ; if the price was not paid they would have to take over the camels . Hussein winced . A few pearls , that 's all they had , he said miserably , wrinkling his crafty little eyes . Finally the price was established and paid . Twenty pearls were slid from the chain and dropped into the palm of the oldest tribesman , who rolled them about greedily , peered at them , sniffed at them , and finally tasted them with the tip of his tongue . Ismael came waddling up with new trays of food . The tribesmen were all in high spirits by now , clapping their hands and jingling their talismans . Idris brought out his mizmar , and one of the girls leaped up to dance . The excitement kept rising , fanned by the fumes of the hashish pipe . The old men clapped their hands in an accelerating rhythm . Idris 's wrist danced like a bird along the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet started to quiver . The bedu girl swayed to the music , supple as a stoat . She was unveiled ; in the oasis all the women had been veiled . A strange unease filled the air . One of the boys sprang toward the firelight . " Look , look ! " he cried , swelling his biceps and breaking a knife between his fists . " Look ! " cried another , lifting a huge , smoldering log out of the fire . " Look at me ! " cried a third , ripping his loincloth from his body . Others rose one by one and joined the onanistic dancer . A rhythmic chant began : " Oom-oom . . . Oom-oom . . . " Eyes were glittering with drugs ; bellies and thighs shone with sweat . The scent of sex , pungent and peppery , joined the odor of woodsmoke . Idris was swept into a maelstrom of naked bodies , and the last that David saw , as he stole with Sylvia back to their tent , was the bedu girl flung through the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flurry of long brown arms.  |p192The  following day brought the " phantom lands , " as Ahmed called them . The air at dawn was still chilly . The men were shivering under their sheepskins as the sun rose in a yellow mist . Gusts of acrid brown smoke were wafted from the camel-dung fire , and finally Ismael brought them the tea which drove away weariness . Then they rose and rode into the harsh morning freshness . Paleolithic flints lay strewn on the ground , flashing in the sun . A shattered , derelict land , as though a hammer out of the sky had sent it splintering into fragments . Slowly , impalpably , like time itself , the shadows of clouds flowed over the tufa . " No faranchi has ever passed those hills , " observed Hussein . " These tribes hate the faranchis . They think whiteness means treachery . The white faranchi , they think , has brought turmoil into the land . " David looked quizzical . " Maybe it 's true ? " " Ah , who knows ? " Hussein belched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even the white faranchi , with all his cleverness , can do nothing against the will of God . " He tugged meaningly at David 's sleeve . " Yesterday 's tribe allowed us to continue . That was the Ram Taqid tribe . But tomorrow 's tribe , the Ruquda tribe , is far more pious and dangerous ! " The clouds died . A new onslaught of light began . Even his muslin clothes grew oppressive to David . Instinctively the camels moved toward the patches of shade , but even in the shade the heat was suffocating . His eyes stung under the sweat , and a headache hammered at his skull . The ground burned at his feet through the thick-soled sandals . The grains of sand sprayed up by the hoofs burned his skin like flying embers . Tiny circles of white-hot thread kept spinning in front of his eyes . They grew larger and larger ; they turned into fiery turbines churning in a sleek , swollen void . He listened : it was like the roar of a great Niagara . Through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will happen . . . somethingwill happen . . . A tiny cloud shaped like a razor floated across the sun . Never mind , he thought , forcing his nerves into calm . Nothing will happen . At noon the sun blazed over a lifeless world . The real desertwas beginning , the periphery of the Rub al Khali  --  no shrubs , no watering places , not even a hill as far as the eye could wander or the mind imagine . There was an air of terrificnewness about the earth , of light and space freshly cast in a white-hot mint . " Hamdullillah ! " cried Hussein and slid off his camel for the noonday prayers . Ismael huddled under his pea-green parasol and opened a tin of sardines . " Where are we exactly ? " said David . " Nowhere exactly . " Yusuf sighed . " This place has no name . It is too empty even to have a name . " Ismael glared from the corners of his eyes . " Tamr lies to the north . " " There is water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Tamr , perhaps ? " said David . Yusuf rested his bearded chin on the knob of his cane . " We should . " He nodded . David waited . Something had been left unsaid . " Is it too far ? " suggested David . " Perhaps , " said Yusuf enigmatically.  |p194The  gravel flamed under the light . A vivid mirage danced on the brink of the plain . A flood of green water was flowing over the empty sands . The backs of the camels bounced like dolphins among the heat-waves , and the dunes were a foamingblaze of surf . They mounted imperceptibly . The intensity of heat declined , and they entered a tableland with ripples of slate running westward . An hour passed . The tinted earth gave way to a blinding white limestone . Another hour went by . It was time for their evening prayers . " Haya alla sala ! Haya alla fellah ! " Their voices broke through the air , bleak and plaintive . They spread out for a nap , planning to continue by starlight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ droned out verses from the Koran , a lulling monotonous sound which sent David to sleep . When he opened his eyes again the stars were on fire.  |p196They  rode on through the night . Their footsteps died in the snow-soft sand . Sylvia looked at the stars , those burning asters with Arabic names , which shone over the land as though they had grown out of Arabia : the Scorpion , Aqrab , Deneb the Tail , Altair the Flyer , and Aldebaran , who was the Follower . Distant volcanoes appeared in the north , drawing smooth black outlines across the horizon . The paraffin lamps swayed noiselessly , the voices of the camel-men were crooning , the saucepans tinkled against the shanks of the camels , and Ahmedkept humming the ninety-nine names of God , to keep awake . The strange pain in the bottom of her throat had gone . The throbbing behind her eyeballs had gone too . But something else had come instead  --  a feeling that everything was unreal , that these camels and men prowling across the sand were just dolls dangling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even moving ; everything she saw was a mirage , and the only reality was this strange dark fever welling around her . It was a fever that sang like the sea ; it moaned and echoed like a great surf breaking . " No , no , " she kept whispering . " Do n't listen to it . Do n't listen to it . " Once they paused for a nap . They ate their last remaining rations of roasted meat , and the renewal of strength brought a renewal of pain and discomfort . Sylvia lay on a sheepskin , Ahmed beside her , and they stared at the stars while the rest of the beduin lay sleeping . Soon the brilliance of the nightp196diminished ; morning was drawing near . The stars shone down on them with a dove-gray coolness . She laid her head on Ahmed 's arm . " We 're friends now , Ahmed , are n't we ? " " Friends of iron , my little madame . " " Ahmed . " She looked at him tensely . " Tell me something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did not ask what she wanted to ask . Insteadshe said , " Tell me , Ahmed . Will we ever get to Aden ? " Ahmed 's eyes grew stern and distant . He knew she wasthinking of something else . " We live on hope , " he whispered . She pressed her face into Ahmed 's powerful , bristling neck and began to sob . " Yes . I know , " said Ahmed tenderly , stroking the hair back from her forehead . " You love him . And he is cold . Be patient , dear little madame . " Idris tapped her on the shoulder and woke her up before dawn . His teeth were flashing in a catlike smile . " Is it time to go ? " " Almost ! " He took her hand and held it against his breast . " Do you feel my heart beating ? " She nodded . " Never has my heart beaten so strongly ! " " Are you in love , Idris ? " " Ssh , madame ! " He placed his finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak of love ! " She drew her hand away , troubled . " Love does n't exist in the desert ? " " Not a love that has a name . Nothing in the desert has a name . One must speak of nothing in the desert that can not be seen with the eyes or touched with the fingers ! " " Idris , listen . Sometimes I see things that ca n't be seen with the eyes . Sometimes I 'm afraid of things I do n't understand , Idris . "  | " Do n't be afraid , " purred Idris . " All will be well . No Arab will ever hurt you . Not even a bad bedu ! " His voice grew courteous , circumspect . " To the bedu you are not beautiful . Unusual , yes . Mysterious , yes . But not at all lovely . Look . Your hair is straight as the wind . Your eyes are like a boy 's . Your mouth is a boy 's . Your hips are slender , your buttocks are small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not for the bedu . Unless , of course  --  " He smiled at her mischievously . " Unless what , Idris ? " " Get up , madame ! It is almost light . Look , there goes Ismaelwith his teapot . " Tamr lay just over the hill , but it was " an angry , Godlovingtown , " said Yusuf . So Ahmed was sent discreetly on foot through the early dawn , to fetch food . He took Ismael 's basketand parasol and disappeared over the dunes while the rest of the men started packing their goatskins . Then they sat in the shade of the tent , waiting for Ahmed to return . He crept through the mouse-gray dunes , vanishing and reappearing , a tiny black spot in that limbo-like emptiness . They waited two hours ; Idris grew nervous . Yusuf told for the seventh time the tale of the thief from Medina , and Ismael recited for the third time the ballad about the ogres from Mocha . They kept straining their eyes . No sign of Ahmed . Idris climbed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , Idris ? " " No . Not yet . Soon , I think . " And then : " Anything in sight , Idris ? " " Not yet . " And finally : " Look again , Idris ! " " The sun is blinding . I see nothing at all . " Idris grew sulky and melancholy . He spoke of Ahmed with a sorrowing reverence , as of a long-lost parent . " He has whatp198only the greatest of men still have , my friends . He has both irdh and murnah ! " He explained to David . Irdh , or honor , meant power and nobility of character . Murnah , or manliness , meant loyalty , courage , and generosity . The stillness of the hills was a waiting stillness . The air had the glaze of a telescope . Iqbal , who was a cousin of Yusuf Qamish and the youngest one in the caravan , started tying the last of the bags together . They were considering a fourhourdetour to Tamr to fetch Ahmed , leaving Sylvia and David behind with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bright green beetle came crawling over the dunes  --  Ahmed and his parasol . He was weary and irritable when he finally joined the caravan , carrying a baby lamb and a jug of honey . The camels rose , and they started off toward the west , with their shadows wandering lazily in front of them.  | " Tariq ! " cried the camel-boy . The camels rose , grunting petulantly . Slowly they entered the zone of the volcanoes . They passed into a huge , rocky amphitheater . In the distancelay the scallops of a range , rolling like waves in the foaming light . Men and beasts , with their goatskins dangling , looked curiously bright and biblical . The camels paused to nibble some frail volcanic flowers which clung to the rocks . " Tariq ! Tariq ! " cried the camel-boy . The camels obedientlyproceeded . On they rode , gradually entering a new kind of dreariness  --  hard gray hummocks , on which the hoofs left only faint little marks , like commas , and a wadi below them which had been parched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert dryness , with cracks dividing the earth into great octagonal tiles . Above them shone the irregular crests of rock  --  chunks of obsidian , smooth as glass , radiating a whole spectrumof colors . The camels moved along , supercilious as dowagers . There was something grand about these patient , dour , arrogant creatures . Man 's link with the desert : the drabness as well as the pride , the indignation of the desert . Young Iqbal loved his camel with a deep , unuttered love . He walked close beside it , stroking its belly now and then . Once three shadows appeared , moving in single file along the ridge . They looked like men from the Ruquda tribe , remarkedHussein  --  brightly decked , dressed in black . They paused for a minute or two on the ridge and disappeared on the other side of the hill.  | " They are devils , " said Yusuf . " Those men from the Ruquda tribe . " " Devils ? " said David . " All in black ! With souls like midnight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . The angels are all in white . " Yusuf grinned . " Look , " said David . " Idris is wearing a white futah . Is Idris an angel ? " " Today , yes , " said Yusuf philosophically . " Tomorrow , who knows ? Idris is too nervous to be an angel for long . " As the heat grew worse the camels grew sullen and unpredictable . Their eyelids grew droopy , cadaverous-looking ; the old naga was panting like a motor . When David touched her belly it felt hot as an oven . In this extremity of the desert David felt his senses changingtheir hues , like a film exposed to the light . Into this barrenworld now crept a strange variety of sensuous effects  --  of color and temperature , of scent and sound . Everything changed its consistency . Everything partook of the opposite . The sun looked black ; the stillness grew clamorous . The wind seemed solid , steady as a wall , and the rocks grew tenuous and vibrant , like the wind . The heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At ten o'clock the sand blazed and billowed like lava . At eleven the eyes of the camel-men were sunken and purple . At noon the world was aflame , and they crawled into the darkness of their tents , gasping for breath . " Two more days like this will be the end of us , " said Yusuf miserably . " Such heat has never existed . Bad luck with the water , bad luck with the weather . Now , who knows , there 'll be bad luck with the Ruqudas ! " " An evil spirit is pursuing us , " hummed Idris , tapping David 's arm.  | " Yes ? What spirit ? " " The elderly sir ! " " You think he has turned into a spirit ? " " He is dead ! And his ghost is following us ! " " What nonsense , Idris ! " " Only an angry ghost could bring such heat ! " His voice grew wistful . " Once , Sir Daid , we had a good spirit . " " What spirit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us from our enemies . Now she neglects us . She prefers Sabaya , where it is cool . " " Who knows ? " said David halfheartedly . " Maybe she stillprotects us , Idris . " Idris snuggled his head on David 's lap , like a kitten . " I have a sadness , Sir Daid . " " What is your sadness ? " Idris sighed . " I do not belong with my people . " " Why not ? " " Look ! " He pointed to his eyes . " There is blue in my eyes . I am not a pure bedu . My father was a stranger . Perhaps from London . " " Where were you born , Idris ? " " In Mukalla . In a brothel , sir . " " You 're very dark . I do n't think your father was an Englishman , Idris . " Idris pouted . " I have the soul of an Ingliz . Sensitive and elegant . Do n't mock me , Daid ! " He plucked at David 's wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will be your slave . I will follow you everywhere . If you ask me to chop off my arm , I will do it ! " " That would be rash , would n't it , Idris ? " " Ah , perhaps . But all beduin are rash , " growled Idris . They entered the night again . The paraffin lamps were lit , and the camels , unable to see any shrubs to distract theirp202attention , began to move more swiftly and placidly . The men sang in unison . " Shey latif ! Ma salaam ! " David took hold of Sylvia 's hand as they paused in the dunes for their nightly tea . " You look sleepy ! " " No , " she whispered , snatching her hand away . " I 'm wide awake . " " You need a rest , " he said . " You need sleep . Be patient , my dear . Four more days , and we 'll be in Mukalla . " She looked at him gravely , listening , with her huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he whispered , " Sylvia ! Make a wish ! " " I made it long ago , " said Sylvia in a trembling voice . " Make another then . Quickly ! " " It wo n't come true . I know it wo n't . " " If you wish it hard enough it will come true , perhaps . " She looked solemnly at her fingertips . " Can one wish for happiness , do you think ? " Suddenly she twisted her head around and cried , " Why are these people so happy ? In this awful land ? " " Who knows ? They love life , even when life is rather un-pleasant . " A moment later she whispered , " What has happened to Doctor Moss , do you suppose ? " " Nothing , probably . We 'll meet him in Mukalla , " said David uncomfortably . She shook her head . " No , we wo n't . You think what I think . What they all think . " And suddenly she cried , " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've turned into sav-ages ! " As he lay there , half asleep , the past unrolled like a great map . His mind reached back through the convolutions of India , the shadowy gullies of Japan . It crossed the Pacific and rambled over the great Wyoming hills ; it wandered eastwardp203and finally came to rest on the shore of a river , where the birches shone through the clear cool glow of a summer evening . Black-eyed susans speckled the fields ; sumac flowed over the hills . A dusty path led up past the cornfield , which swayed lazily in the ruddy air , rosy tassels dangling like manes through the crisp , fluted ears . There was a barbed-wire fence along the edge of the orchard . Hornets buzzed over the rottingcrab apples ; grasses stirred over a passing snake . Dragonfliesbright as mica went zooming down to the banks , where the cattails bristled in the soft gray mud . A family of turtles lay dozing on a trunk that floated by . Not a sound , except for the humming of insects , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air grew filmy . And suddenly from the western hills rose the whistle of the freight train on its way to Prairie du Chien . Then stillness again ; the sweet , harsh stillness of the inarticulate . Leaves came drifting down from the birches , bright as goldenrod , and tufts of thistledownlay floating in the windless air . This was the past which had shaped him ; this was the intensity which lay buried in him . As his mind reached into the darkness , trying to grasp the nature of his loneliness , to touch the roots of that shapeless anxiety which never left him , what he saw was the vast , haunting savagery of an entire land  --  a land where desirehung like an aura in the very smell of the woods , where it fell and withered like the little crab apples in the grass . Was this the specter which haunted him ? This perpetual yearning of a land that had grown too fast and had flung the mantle of power over a raw , barbarous body ? The shore darkened . The river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raspberry bushes , and down by the Devil 's Nose a kingfisherdove  --  one quick splash , a flurry of blue , then lost in the peace of the autumn night.  |p204Now  the land grew undulating , with giant waves rippling toward the west . The gravel had turned to a coral red , soft as heather to the nostrils but sharp as a chisel to the feet and the eyes . They paused before noon , and Iqbal built a zariba out of matting to protect them against the wind . There they lingered in the troubled shade , drinking tea out of rusty tins . Old Ismael sat close by David , his pale blue turban stained with sweat . David could smell the sagelike scent of his wise , wilted body . " Tonight , " said Ismael , with a stormy look in his joined black eyebrows , " we pass the Ruquda tribe . We of the Ruashidhave a blood feud , as it happens , with the Ruqudas . Sometimes the authorities come and try to put an end to the feud . But hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace . " He paused , drawing his fingers over his nostrils . " Once a young man of the Ruashid , a distant cousin of mine , was passing through this region with three merchants from Shibwa . It was late in the day , and they saw two horsemenriding out of the west . The men followed in the distance but never drew close . Night came ; the strangers vanished . But when my cousin woke in the morning he saw two of the merchantslying in the sand with their throats cut wide open . " " And the third merchant ? " " Vanished ! And the money too ! " " He killed the other two , I suppose , and ran off with the money ? " " Possibly . But we prefer to think otherwise . We prefer top205think , contrary to the evidence , that it was the men of the Ruquda tribe who did it . After all , vengeance is sweeter than compromise . " " And so you of the Ruashid started a feud with the Ruqu-das ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lowered his lids discreetly . " I bore you , I 'm afraid , with all my chitter-chatter . " They started again at dusk . The climate was changing . The extremes were more violent , the winds were more brutal . And the mental climate changed too , grew suspicious and irritable . The light of the moon was a light without gentleness . And as the hours moved past them the passage of time grew equated with the passage of landscape , and David felt a sense of the numinous rising around him . Here at last it seemed absurd to think of time as measurable . Space was vast , darknessinfinite , but above all it was time that took on grandeur in this ocean of sand . The churning of turbines had gone ; the sound of the cataract had died ; all that existed was a gulf of emptiness , like a bowl carved into the sea . The night passed in a daze . When day broke they were lame and weary . He felt his knees swollen with pain and a whittling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed down and rolled up in their dirty camel rugs and lay among tufts of grass which warded off the whip of the wind . Dawn rose with a pink flush . The Moslems turned wearily toward Mecca , bad-temperedwith rheumatism , and washed their faces in the sand , muttering huskily , " Allahu Akbar ! " Sylvia was still asleep when he woke up . He knelt beside her and looked at her face . Sun and sicknesshad left a fine , swollen web around her eyes . He remem/bered how she had looked the first time he saw her , when they stepped on the plane at Bombay  --  shy and prim , with her smooth black hair tied neatly behind her head , her cheeks plump and rosy , her eyes alert as a setter 's . Now she looked like a gypsy , dark and tousled and weather-beaten . Even as she slept he could see the change : her girlhood had gone . A hot glow shone under her skin , like a flame shining through a sheet of parchment . He laid his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at him with a touch of fear , which instantly died . " Is it time to go ? " she whispered . " Not yet . " " Why did you look at me ? " " I watched you dreaming . " " Could you guess what I was dreaming ? " " About bandits , maybe ? " She shook her head . " About England , possibly ? " " I 've already forgotten . Tell me , David . Have I changed very much ? " " We 've all changed , I think . " " Am I older ? " " Yes . A little . " She smiled wanly . " Someday I 'll be old enough for you to love me ! " It was well after noon , and the air was hot and breathless . Half-naked figures were hauling water out of the well for the camels . This was the last well , said Ismael , for a long , long stretch . They filled the water-bags with the ill-smelling fluid , and Idris started to boil the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , milk tablets , chocolate , sardines . As the afternoon deepened the light created new images . All things seemed laden with significance  --  a ring of stones , the skull of a camel . Petrified trunks of trees suggested a remoteantiquity . And the men , masked with dirt , bearded andp207brittle-haired and sullen , looked like neolithic wanderers as they lay in the shade of the camels . " It is dangerous to start early , " said Ismael dourly . " The Ruquda people are watching us . They will shoot as we pass their hills . " " It is dangerous to start , in any case , " said Yusuf , scowling , " but it is more dangerous to wait . These are nasty lands . " So they started off again while the sun still hung over the horizon . One by one the camels rose , and the caravan uncoiled . That evening David caught sight of an unusually brilliantmirage . A great scimitar cut through the air , like a distant mountain . As they drew closer , just at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rivers and palm groves unfurled , and a beautiful vista of deep blue pools . Everything began to quiver . The leading camel lost its outlines ; it turned into a tower and then a great umbrella ; then it narrowed into an obelisk and for a moment vanished . Finallythey reached the defile . The sun sank . The mirage faded . A sultry blue covered the land , and the hills drew back into shadow . A voice called from the hills . They turned and looked and saw no one . Ismael called back angrily and wanted to halt . But Hussein ordered the men on , and they continued , sore and dust-ridden and quarrelsome . A shot echoed in the distance . Their lethargy left them like magic . Their eyes sparkled . Ahmed drew out his gun , and Idris shook his arms delightedly . They led the camels behind the dune . Then Ahmed started firing . Two guns replied . Idris got out the old Berdane rifle and cocked it gleefully . The firingfrom the hills stopped . The camels yawned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lungs , " Cowards ! Idiots ! Pigs ! Centipedes ! " But only an echo replied to his quavering old voice . A fit of recklessness came over Idris ; his eyes flashed with joy , and he started running up the slope , brandishing his rifle.  | " Come back , Idrisl " cried Ahmed . " Do n't be a fool , Idris , " called David . But a wild young daring was alive in Idris . He shouted defiantly at the hills . The men conferred ; Ismael was arguing stubbornly with Ahmed . And then another shot rang out and Idris gave a sharp little cry . He sank to the ground , wailing bitterly ; a bullet had entered his thigh . An hour later they were under way again . Night had fallen . The stars were blazing.  |p209The  chilling night was followed by a hot blinding day . Light flooded the landscape like a boiling wave . The wadi-bed was strewn with clusters of shriveled grass and stunted camelthorn . Here and there shone dark green hollows , where water had lain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of stone which lay spread on a plateau . Chips of flint lay scattered about , split by some ancient cataclysm into the blood-red spatulas . Then they crept down again . The gullies shimmered with heat . A carpet of dust was wandering over the dunes , which were patterned like a tiger-skin . Finally they reached a smooth , canary-bright plain  --  no plants , no birds or insects ; not even stones . Only a gulf of gravel . The world lay transformed into a burning disk , ceaselessly quivering . Once the mirage of water grew so convincing that their hearts rose in hope . But then the mirage rippled away again , revealing a sand-worn skeleton . " Where are we ? " whispered the young boy , Iqbal . " Do you know where we are , Yusuf ? " Yusuf nodded . " There , to the north , lies Aq Medla . And an hour later Iqbal cried , " We are lost , Yusuf ! " But Yusuf pointed to the south and said , " There lies JebelMullah . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing . Danger wandered beside them like a shadow . So much depended on so little . So little was enough to destroy . A broken water-skin , an ailing camel , a moment of uncertainty in Yusuf 's bearings  --  any of these might be fatal , so slim was the margin of security . Notp210an inessential ounce of luggage , not an extra footstep could be afforded . Most of them were walking . Only the wounded Idris and Sylvia were riding ; and now and then , for a rest , old Ismael , the cook . Yusuf insisted on doing eleven hours a day  --  thirty-five miles or so , at the rate they were going . And now the desert brought out the intrinsic flavor in each character . Triviality and pretense fell away . Laziness , lechery , all fell away . Iqbal turned into a grown-up man , full of a strong , fervent dignity . Ismael turned into a youth again , wayward , resilient . Yusuf was touched with a kind of fatalisticpride . Ahmed showed a loving , confident calm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But even so , dangerous tensions were developing under the surface . The wind turned around and blew southward from Shibam . Comets of sand shot from the hoofs of the camels . On they trudged in a brainless rhythm , borne by nothing but a sheer blind passion for survival . " Three more days , " Hussein kept chanting . " Three days , and we 'll be there . " " With luck , maybe , " growled Ibrahim , the black one . " With or without , " sang Hussein with a parrot-like glare . " Courage , " moaned Yusuf . " In Suqa we 'll find water andfruit . And in Mukalla we 'll find riches and fleshly consola-tion ! " Sylvia rode on the small she-camel . David poured ointment on her blistered feet . The diet of dates had given her a splittingtoothache ; he kept giving her aspirin in spite of the heat . Ismael came up beside her and glanced up in his sweet old way . " Women are weak ! " he said whimsically . Sylvia gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , " said Ismael , " they are very weak . The rest of the time they are somewhat weak . " He looked deepp211into her eyes ; his wrinkled face grew solicitous . " Do you have your monthly sickness now , madame ? " Sylvia blushed and glanced toward the hills . " Not quite , " she said . " It is over now . " Ismael nodded understandingly . " One must be careful . " He sighed . " It is wearisome to be a woman , dear madame , is n't it ? " Once they saw some small red flowers nestling beside a rock . But when David reached down to touch them they turned out to be lifeless , petrified . The men now looked like a band of ruffians , ragged and surly . The camels had grown very thin , and the strength and sweetness of their souls now emerged in the hours of hardship . They wandered on , waiting for the coolness of night to gather them , the merciful night , which was like a river on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dipped ; a whiff of freshness shot toward them . An edge of sand was tufted with coarse gray brush . Lizards went stuttering into their holes . " There was a well here three years ago , " said Yusuf thoughtfully . They halted , turning the camels to graze in that inhospitablegrowth ; the two boys spread their scarlet rugs in the dying sunlight . Then the men said their prayers . Ismael set the water to boil for tea and started cooking their last bit of rice on a brushwood fire . Iqbal and the black , silent Ibrahim begandigging for water . " Is it moist yet , Ibrahim ? " Ismael kept calling . " No . Not yet , " growled Ibrahim . Idris lay down beside David and drew off his loincloth , inch by inch . A slate-blue spot shone in his thigh . David washed it lightly with disinfectant . But the bullet-hole looked ugly . There wasp212a sleekness around it , like a stain of oil running across the groin . " Here it hurts badly , " whispered Idris , pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , pointing to the heart of the wound . " You will save me , Daid , wo n't you ? " he cried softly and buried his head in David 's arms . Ismael woke up Sylvia presently and poured her tea from the battered kettle . Ibrahim had finally discovered a few drops of brownish water . The pain in her eyes had gone down . Her toothache had gone as well . All she felt at this moment was a kind of gropingamazement . She felt herself hanging in midair , suspended on a fine silky thread . The earth below her looked like the bottom of a chasm . She looked up and tried to follow the thread into the sky . It went up and up , soaring into the empty blueness , but , as she watched , it started to tremble , about to break . She raised the cup and held it to her lips ; her hand shook against the rim . Night fell . She saw Ahmed sitting motionless in the starlight , staring at the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white turban . " Look ! " he said to her , pointing . A shooting star flashed over the desert  --  a rosy arc , quick as a humming-bird , then lost in the dark . " To us , " said Ahmed , " it means an omen . " " To us it means a wish will come true . " " Make a wish ! " said Ahmed , touching her hand . She made a wish  --  the same as before , with one slight difference . " What was your wish ? " " I ca n't tell you , Ahmed . Or it wo n't come true . "  | " I think I know your wish , " said Ahmed . He added quietly , " When a star shoots in the north it means a camel will die . " " But this one shot in the south , did n't it , Ahmed ? " " That means  --  " But he did n't finish his sentence . He gazedpatiently at the ground and whispered , " My brave littlemadame ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
