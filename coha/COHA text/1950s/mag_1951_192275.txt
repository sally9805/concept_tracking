Pert , brunette Evelyn Caldwell , 42 , who writes the " Penny Wise " shopping column for the Vancouver Sun ( circ. 161,603 ) , got a chance two months ago at a free air trip to Australia . When she asked Sun Publisher Don Cromie 's permission to go , Cromie meditatively twirled the globe on his desk . " You know , " he said , " Korea is only about four inches from Australia . You 'd better drop in there and see how our boys are making out . " <P> For the past six weeks , Sun readers have been following Penny Wise 's gushy , column-long dispatches from the Korea front . Their emphasis was on how Penny herself , not the boys , was faring . One of her first discoveries was the shortage of ladies ' powder rooms along the 38th parallel . Near the front line , she " prayed fervently for a set of bulletproof undies . " At Pusan , she tried on a Korean woman 's costume , including an infant slung on her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've always believed that when in Rome you should visit La Scala . " She also took a jet plane ride arranged by U.S.A.F. Colonel H. A. Schmid , who , gurgled Penny , was " the smartest and the best-looking and the youngest colonel I 've ever met . " <P> Putting her own interpretation on the boss 's orders is an old trademark of Veteran Newshen Caldwell . In 1937 , while on the staff of the city 's News-Herald , she went to England to cover the coronation . She passed up the ceremony to attend a Punch &; Judy show ( " I could n't stand all the fuss " ) , filed a long coronation story to her paper the next day with a footnote confessing she had seen it all in the newsreels . <P> Once , when her boss insisted she cover a livestock show , Penny fulfilled his order for " unusual pictures . " Said she : " I took the north end of all the animals looking south . " The managing editor , furious at first , finally ran the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of her Korea series in the Sun last week , it looked as though Reporter Caldwell 's new approach to war had also caught the readers ' fancy . Her nighty dispatches regularly outpulled the factual war correspondence . Back at her desk , Penny was busy answering a heavy rush of readers ' mail and preparing a schedule of speaking dates . Penny herself summed up her role in a sentence : " I was a damn nuisance and I knew it . "
