txt  |  his friends were wrong the mere fact of his candidacy dashed Webster 's chances . Millard Fillmore , an obscure ex-Congressman from New York State , had been nominated for the vice-presidency in 1848 as a concession to the friends of Henry Clay , who were in a vengeful mood when General Taylor was given the first place on the ticket . Since hardly anyone had heard of Fillmore it was assumed that he would not lose the party many votes . He was a large man with a big , smooth , kindly face and impressive manners . He looked like a President and much to his surprise he had become one , and he did not see why he should give way to Webster . Fillmore was not gifted with political insight . After the election of 1848 , when the country was torn with the most intense strife it had known , he said : " I regard this election as putting an end to all ideas of disunion . It raises up a national party , occupying a middle ground , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the hope of destroying the fair fabric of our Constitution . " Later , as we have seen , he did his best to make these cheerful words come true by giving to the great Compromise the full support of his Administration , and he thought the party should therefore help him to a second term . The convention thought otherwise . For fifty-two ballots Fillmore and Webster divided the moderate pro-Compromise vote . Neither could win and neither could hand his following to the other . So in the end the Seward Whigs ( the " Conscience Whigs , " who were soon to become Republicans ) were allowed to nominate Winfield Scott , the general who had led American troops to Mexico City. * Fillmore was to make one last eccentric appearance on the national stage in 1856 , and was then to retire into innocuous philanthropy in western New York . Perhaps his most striking and unusual act came in 1855 , when he refused the degree of D.C.L. from Oxford University on the ground that he had no literary or scientific attainments . The South distrusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as politics and opinions were concerned he seemed as colorless as a man may be . It was for this that the convention accepted him , and this was the sum of the Whig hopes : that nobody would discover whether Scott stood for anything at all , and that the people might be content to vote for him because of his war record . But the Whig Party was dying , along with the two men who had made it great . Clay , who might have put spirit into the slack campaign , died on June 29 . Webster , who had repudiated Scott 's nomination and prophesied his party 's doom , died on October footnote * On the first ballot Fillmore received 133 votes , Scott 131 , and Webster 29 . The vote remained much the same until the break on the fifty-third ballot . There were 396 delegates , and since the Whigs nominated by a simple majority 149 votes were needed for a choice . If Fillmore and Webster could have come together , either could have been nominated .  | 24 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the nation there was no such wave of tenderness and respect as had been roused by the death of Clay . Webster had left instructions for a simple funeral . " My heart swelled , " wrote one of his friends , " when I saw the eminent men all passed by , and six plain men of Marshfield called out to be pallbearers . Was not that beautiful ? " It would have been well for Webster 's career if he had made the gesture while he was still alive . Truly , he might have claimed to be a friend of the plain men of Marshfield most of his days , for he had long defended the Union , which was the hope of democracy ; but while breath was in his body Webster could not pass by the eminent men . The new leaders of industry , the factory-rich , were his clients , and the masses may be forgiven for thinking that where his fees lay , there lay his heart . Yet even the masses , who had judged him coldly , may have felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Webster had gone with Calhoun to the grave . These were the men who had given strength and continuity and many a touch of grandeur to the politics of the country ever since the far-off days of the second war with England ? ever since America grew up and cut loose from Europe and set out in isolation on westward-walking paths to follow her strange new destiny . " Eastward I go only by force , " said Thoreau ; " but westward I go free . . . . I must walk toward Oregon and not toward Europe . " Yet the Oregon Trail could be lonely ? lonelier than ever when the old leaders had departed . Fillmore and Pierce and Scott were no substitute , nor Seward with his " higher law , " nor the rising star of Illinois : Stephen A. Douglas . In the nation 's life it was one of the hours of low vitality , during the midnight watch , when man is shaken with fears he does not own . Even before election day of 1852 the Whig Party was crumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in his acceptance letter about the Compromise of 1850 ? although the platform had promised that the entire Compromise , including the Fugitive Slave Law , would be accepted and maintained . At once an important group of Southern Whig Congressmen , led by Robert Toombs and Alexander H. Stephens of Georgia , rejected Scott and seceded from the party . This was an act of decisive importance because of the character of the two leaders . Toombs and Stephens between them had been the symbols of Union sentiment in the Deep South . They were moderate Whigs who could work loyally with Webster of Massachusetts . They were opposed to expansion at the expense of Mexico ; but when the war had been fought and won , and an attempt  | was then made by means of the Wilmot Proviso to prevent the spread of slavery into any part of the new land , both men insisted that such an act must lead to secession . They were serving in the House of Representatives , and they warned the Northern members . " Appropriate this common property to yourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , not mine . Then I am its enemy , and I will then , if I can , bring my children and my constituents to the altar of liberty , and like Hamilcar I would swear them to eternal hostility to your foul domination . " And Stephens said that if the Proviso passed , the result would be " desolation , carnage and blood . " The two Georgians worked for the Compromise measures of 1850 , and when these were passed they joined with the moderate Democrat , Howell Cobb , to beg their state to accept this triumph for the Union . A convention had been summoned with power to take any action it chose , including secession ; but because of the work of Toombs , Stephens , and Cobb the convention had a great majority of Union delegates . It accepted the Compromise , reserving the right to secede later in case Congress or the Northern states sought to weaken or to reinterpret the document . While winning this victory the three friends formed a new state organization , the Constitutional Union Party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereafter collapsed . Both Toombs and Stephens returned to their former allegiance until the nomination of General Scott . When these two Union patriots joined Cobb in the Democratic Party . Calhoun 's plan had at last triumphed . Most of the leading cotton-state Whigs had finally become Democrats , giving to the South the intellectual and political control of the party for so long as she could hold the numerous Northern voters in line . This was not long . Within less than a decade of their break with the Whigs , Toombs was the Confederate Secretary of State and Stephens the Confederate Vice-President . While the South was deserting the Whig Party on the ground that General Scott had free-soil tendencies , a number of Northerners were deserting it on the ground that he was a tool of the slave power . They joined a new group , under the leadership of Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts and Senator Salmon P. Chase of Ohio , which called itself the Free Democratic Party . In their 1852 platform they stated : That the Free Democratic party is not organized to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slave Compromise party of the nation , but to defeat them both ... ; That slavery is a sin against God and a crime against man . . . ; and that Christianity , humanity , and patriotism , alike demand its abolition . That the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 is repugnant to the Constitution , to the principles of the common law , to the spirit of Christianity , and to the sentiments of the civilized world . We therefore deny its binding force upon the American People , and demand its immediate and total repeal . "  | In the election the Democrats carried twenty-seven states for Franklin Pierce and the Whigs four for General Scott : Massachusetts , Vermont , Kentucky , d Tennessee . The popular vote was not so one-sided , for the Whigs were less than 300,000 behind in a total vote of about three million . Yet it was clear that the Whigs were perishing as a national party . In order to hold such Northern members as Seward and Thurlow Weed and Horace Greeley of the New York Tribune , who refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slave Law , they had rejected " honest , commonplace Fillmore , " and had thereby lost their best friends in the South . But the Whigs were the parents of the Compromise and they could not disown it . They could not make a deal with men who would rather break the Union than return one Negro to captivity ? any more than with fire-eating Southerners who preferred secession to agreeing that there were limits to the slave empire . No national party in America has room for men who hold one sacred belief to which all else must bow . When the issue arises ( as it may always and honorably arise ) on which men feel too deeply to compromise , they are obliged to put their own will first and the Union second . The " Conscience Whigs " preferred their conscience to the Whig unity , which was surely their privilege , but which consigned them to membership in a sectional group . They belonged where they were going ? with Sumner and Chase and the Free Democrats into a new party which was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbending , not from self-righteousness , but because they felt they had made the last concession which their faith in man permitted . The Whig Party asked its Northern members to accept the ugly sight of fugitives chained and returned to slavery . As more and more Northerners found they could not do it , they were forced to abandon the party . And as the party leaders sought by worldly shifts and evasions to persuade them that they need not leave , that perhaps the Fugitive Slave Act did not mean quite what it said , the Southerners also became outraged and began to desert . The more the party strained for a formula which would satisfy both groups , the more it hastened its demise . By the time of President Pierce 's inauguration in March , 1853 , he and his Democratic Party were the one remaining hope of the Union . The hope seemed by no means desperate . During the election even the fierce Southern-rights Democrats of Mississippi and South Carolina had quietly accepted the Compromise , the nomination of Pierce , and the party 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Free Democrats , meanwhile , had polled only 150,000 votes , and a secessionist candidate in the South only 3500 . The country longed for harmony . In the midst of a gold boom and of a vast railway revolution , the country wanted to build and to grow rich , not to quarrel . A majority was in favor of en-  | forcing the Compromise and saying no more about it . That act of assuagement had killed the Whigs because large numbers in the Northern and Western wings of the party resented it . They felt they had been overwhelmed by the august names of Clay and Webster . Some Democrats felt the same but not the Democratic majority . They and the remaining faithful Whigs were grateful for the Compromise and would abide by it so long as no man dared reopen the fighting subject . But it is to keep them asleep . The task was beyond the powers of poor vacillating Pierce , who not only woke them up but gave them insomnia . Perhaps it was in any case too late . Perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid . " For it must needs be that offenses come , but woe to the man by whom the offense cometh . " Perhaps , as John Quincy Adams had written in 1820 , " the seeds of the Declaration of Independence are yet maturing . The harvest will be what West , the painter , calls the terrible sublime . " Yet the student of politics may reasonably ask whether a wiser and stronger President might have saved the day . The slave issue could not break the Union until it had broken the Democratic Party . If Pierce and his successor had been true leaders , they might have made such use of party loyalty as to preserve the peace . Loyalty to an irrational party which lives by barter and by ignoring both logic and principles may be derided . Yet when men belong to an organization which has lasted a long time , to which they have given their hopes and their work , and from which they have won the gift of comradeship , of being members of one another , a sense of faithfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel . Party loyalty is a refuge not only from the hurtful confusion of life but from the self-interest which turns man 's hand against his friend . Within the magic circle of fealty men will compound their differences , or if that is impossible they will do their best to forget them . Loyalty may win concessions which would not be granted to logic . If a nation had to fight a civil war each time it faced an issue that could not be solved , the life of man would be more perilous than the jungle . The parties in a free country depend for their health on those who understand the machine and use it with some detachment ; but they depend for their lives on those who will vote as their fathers voted so long as the trust is not too grossly strained . Without the floating vote free politics would become corrupt ; without the loyal vote free politics would dissolve in chaos. * footnote * In 1938 , after thirty-five years in Washington and forty-five years in elective office , Vice-President John Nance Garner remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " who will never scratch the party ticket and they serve a great purpose of stability . You have another fifteen million who swing often or occasionally , or go fishing or stay at home on election day , and these fifteen million serve a great purpose , too . " ( Cp . Garner of Texas , by Bascom Timmons , p. 236 . ) All the party combinations , all the desperate search for ideas which will please as many interests as possible and for candidates who will make as few enemies as possible , are directed toward these last fifteen million . Mr. Garner put the percentage of floating voters higher than many observers ; but since he has hardly ever been wrong in predicting an election , his opinion has authority .  | The American Union was an abstraction to many of the simpler citizens in 1852 and 1856 , especially to the small farmers of the South and to the newest immigrants . But the Democratic Party was not an abstraction . In the big towns of the North , on the frontier , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , worked in it , triumphed and failed in it . To be sure , the party used different arguments in different states , but the name was honored everywhere , and the heroic ( if unexamined ) past of Jefferson and Jackson . For the sake of party unity and party victory these millions might have been persuaded to give the Compromise of 1850 a fair chance . But party loyalty was not invoked . Neither Pierce nor Buchanan could conjure that mighty spell . As we shall see in a later chapter , when the break came in 1860 Democratic " loyalty " was to the state or section ? not to the national party which had won power in 1800 and which , under many forms and disguises , with many philosophies and systems , had ruled the nation during most of the intervening years .  | " OF ALL PRESIDENTS , I suppose none was more insignificant than Mr. Pierce , who was occupying the White House at the time of our visit . " Such was the judgment of Laurence Oliphant , ' who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a treaty of reciprocity between the United States and Canada . The insignificance which the Englishman noted had been shown on the first day of the new President 's Administration , when he made his undistinguished Inaugural Address and announced his distinguished but incompatible Cabinet . The election of 1852 had shown that although the big majority was eager to give the Compromise a trial , strong-willed and bitter minorities did not intend that it should last . The best-loved leaders of New England thought the Fugitive Slave Act was immoral and that no good citizen should accept it . Ralph Waldo Emerson , for example , called it a law " which no man can obey or abet the obeying , without loss of self-respect and forfeiture of the name of a gentleman . " And in the South the extremists were waiting for the first sign that Emerson 's advice was to be followed , for the moderates would then be discredited . In the autumn of 1852 the governor of South Carolina told his legislature that recent Northern politeness to the South would not last .

Two months before this disturbing message , Howell Cobb ( the Union Democrat who had done so much to bring the state of Georgia to accept the Compromise ) received a letter of foreboding from a friend : You well know that it has been my conviction for the last two or three years that nothing we could do , short of general emancipation , would satisfy the North . Your idea was that the measures of the Compromise would substantially effect that object , and you went for them for that reason chiefly , I think . Should it turn out that I am right and you are wrong it will not be long before it must be known . And it is , therefore , now time for you to be making up your mind for the new " crisis .

The writer makes a forecast which is remarkable for its pessimistic accuracy : The Democratic party there in the North , in conjunction with pretty much the whole South , may be able to make one fight , say in 1856 ? a grand Union rally ? but then the thing will be out . Is it not so ? You must have thought of all this . Have you made up your mind as to what is to be done ? Presumably Howell Cobb had faced these chances , and had decided exactly what to do , for a few years later he was a major general in the Confederate armies . With the country in such a mood , restless with such fears , the hope for the Compromise lay in strong leadership . The President should have said that the health of the nation depended on the great settlement , that it must be treated as irrevocable , that arguments about slavery must now cease since every acre of land under the American flag had been awarded either to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore give office to no man who did not promise to make the Compromise work . The Free-Soil Democrats in the North and the fire-eaters in the South would have protested ; but the people had dismissed both groups in the election , and if no new hate-provoking deeds had been permitted the Union might have found time to heal its wounds , to diminish its rancors , and to seek an evolutionary cure for the race problem . The naming of Pierce 's Cabinet put an end to such hopes . Instead of insisting on men who upheld the Union and the election promises , Pierce put into his Cabinet able and forceful representatives of every diverse opinion . So his Administration was doomed to become a minor civil war within itself . And if one side conquered in the family quarrel , it would impose fresh disturbances at a time when the country craved and deserved a rest. * Perhaps the wisest man in the new Administration was the Secretary of State , William L.

He belonged to the wing of the footnote * Pierce had followed normal practice in seeking to appease all party dissidents by his cabinet appointments . But Pierce was so weak that he could not control his own servants and the country was so shaken that it could not endure another uproar . So normal practice proved a disaster .  | party from which the whole of the Cabinet should have been chosen . He could have worked creatively with the Union Democrats who had defeated the secessionists in Georgia , Mississippi , and South Carolina . But he was not a ruthless fighter , and when Jefferson Davis was made Secretary of War , Marcy could neither collaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domineering Southerner . He was a good Secretary of State , but he could not perform the President 's proper task of bringing unity into the government . Neither could he stand against Caleb Cushing of Massachusetts , who allied himself with Davis to win the battle of the Cabinet and to destroy all hopes of appeasement . Jefferson Davis was born in Kentucky in 1808 , not far from where Lincoln was born a year later . His father had been an officer in the Revolutionary Army , his grandfather a Welsh immigrant . He was the tenth child in a very poor family and his prospects were small ; but when he was still an infant the family moved to Mississippi and the eldest son began to prosper . Jefferson was given a good education at Transylvania University and at West Point , where he was a contemporary of Robert E. Lee . He then served for years as an officer at tiny Western posts , until his unhappy romance with the daughter of Colonel Zachary Taylor , which led him to resign from the army and return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 45 ) he was a planter . With the help of his brother Joseph and of a small inheritance from his father , he bought and cleared new land and became one of the founders and leaders of a new state . He developed an intense local patriotism and a love for the easy life and patriarchal ways of the well-to-do in the Deep South . He worked hard during these years , both in the fields and in the library . His plantation prospered and he became learned in history and politics . His slaves were cared for with affection . They were lazy because of the climate , inefficient because of the slave system , and moderately content because Davis was a just man . If he and his beloved Mississippi and his regressive social system had been let alone , he might have become a mild and scholarly country gentleman ; but he was stubborn as well as just , egotistical as well as affectionate , and when the abolitionists began to abuse the planters and their social system incontinently , Jefferson Davis responded with an equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous beauty and a daughter of the ruling aristocracy ) and the same year he began his political career in the House of Representatives . If Mississippi and her planters were to be attacked and traduced , Davis meant to see that the defense was not lacking . When the Mexican War broke out he resigned from Congress to command a regiment of volunteers from his own state . He became a minor national hero at the battle of Buena Vista and was sent back to Washington as Senator . In 1851 he left the Senate to seek the governorship of Mississippi . His opponent was a Compromise-man , whereas Davis was a  | Southern " nationalist " ; that is , he was opposed to the fire-eaters who were ready to secede when only two or three states would move , but he was prepared if tension grew worse to try to unite the entire South and take it out of the Union in a single coup d'etat . Defeated by less than a thousand votes , Davis returned to his plantation until Pierce called him to Washington in 1853 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in view of his longing to strengthen the South . At once he pushed for a Pacific railway along the Mexican border , tying the Gulf states to the coast of California and opening the trade of Asia to the slave society . To make the railway feasible he induced Pierce and Marcy to buy a tract of land from Mexico , known as the G d - Purchase . The treaty had a rough time in the Senate which objected to paying ten million dollars for a territory on which , according to Thomas Hart Benton , not even a Wolf could find a living. * But Davis and his Southern imperialistic friends were able to force ratification . The other strong man of the Cabinet and defender of the Southern cause was the enigmatic Caleb Cushing of Essex County , Massachusetts ? the county which had produced so many leaders of the once great Federalist Party . Secession was perhaps not a frightening word in that county , for in the days of Timothy Pickering the " Essex Junto " had toyed with taking New England out of the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made many enemies and was accused of many faults , but never of cowardice . He had a gift for finding and defending unpopular causes , and he seldom failed to bring them luster . He was born in 1800 , was graduated from Harvard with high distinction in 1817 , was admitted to the bar in 1821 , and a few years later became a state senator . He supported John Quincy Adams against Jackson ? the first and not the worst of his lost causes . In 1834 he went to Washington as a Whig member of the House of Representatives . Although he joined with Adams in defending the right of his constituents to petition Congress against slavery , he also joined with Webster and the " Cotton Whigs " in decrying all efforts to interfere with Southern rights and customs ? thus insuring the maximum of unpopularity from all sides . As a protege of Webster , however , he had a secure political future , and for a time he was the heir apparent . But when President Harrison died and President Tyler fought the Whigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero , Henry Clay ) , Cushing became a member of the hated " Corporal 's Guard " and moved with Tyler toward the Democratic Party .

He arranged for the opening of five Chinese ports to the Americans and for the rights of " extra-territoriality " ? whereby American citizens in China became subject solely to American laws and officials . Needless to say , with the coming of the Mexican War Cushing was one of the few important New Englanders to support President Polk . He raised a regiment and led it to the Rio Grande .

In 1852 Cushing was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention and worked for the nomination of Pierce . He became Attorney General in the new Cabinet , an ally of Jefferson Davis in defense of Southern interests , a strong unshakable supporter of the act which was soon to destroy the Compromise of 1850 . Until the day of South Carolina 's secession he worked with the extreme wing of the Southern Democrats . He then returned to Essex County , joined the Republican Party , and asked permission to fight . When compared with the benign Marcy and with these two powerful and stubborn men , the rest of the Cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that it was disunited , and that the men who stood by the Union were no match for the men who stood by the South . Benton said that the subsequent four years should not be known as the Pierce Administration , since Pierce could never control his own followers . It was " an Administration in which he was inoperative , and in which nullifiers , disunionists , and renegades used his name and his power for their own audacious and criminal purposes . " Into this precarious situation , already threatened by obstinate ambitious men , a President who confused charm with statesmanship , and a Senator who confused bravery with strength , dropped the most unsettling problem  | which had yet bedeviled the republic . We have seen that Jefferson Davis meant to build his Pacific railway through Texas to El Paso , and then along the southern border of New Mexico and the valley of the Gila River to California . The chief advantage to the route was that it lay through country which was already organized under territorial government , whereas the rival routes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had few white settlers and no government . It was widely believed that only one transcontinental railway would be built , so the Senators and Congressmen from the Middle West fought to keep the South from becoming the favored section . Not only were regional jealousies involved , but also the greed of land speculators , for it seemed likely that the city chosen for the eastern terminal of the railway would become a metropolis . Beginning in 1850 bill after bill was introduced to create a territory of Nebraska . The Southern members of Congress blocked each attempt , both because they wished to save the railway for their own section and because the proposed territory lay north of the Missouri Compromise line and must one day increase the number of free states . The chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories was Stephen A. Douglas , the Democratic hope of Illinois , a bouncing , forceful Midwesterner ? as stubborn as Jefferson Davis and even harder to pin down than Caleb Cushing . Douglas did not intend to see his section lose the golden railway prize . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill . He was willing to pay a high price ; but even Douglas would have flinched if he had known the price which destiny was to exact . On January 4 , 1854 , Douglas reported a Nebraska bill which by implication repealed the Missouri Compromise , abolishing Henry Clay 's greatest triumph , the nationally accepted trans-Mississippi frontier between freedom and slavery . The bill was based on the idea of " popular sovereignty " ? or " squatter sovereignty " ? whereby the people of the new territory were to settle the slavery question for themselves . Lewis Cass had suggested such a plan in 1847 ; and in the course of the Compromise measures of 1850 the territories of Utah and New Mexico were organized without the prohibition or the protection of slavery . In due time they were to be admitted as states , with or without slaves , according to the will of their citizens . This was the answer of Clay and Webster to the Wilmot Proviso , which would have excluded slavery from all the spoils of Mexico . Northerners were persuaded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery could not live in arid lands . But much of the proposed Nebraska territory lay east of the fateful ninety-eighth meridian , where the dry country begins . East of 98 ? , the rainfall is above twenty inches and slave agriculture might prosper . Douglas made a mistake when he thought the North would permit the introduction of slaves ? or even  | the threat of such introduction ? next door to Missouri or across the river from Iowa . It was a typical mistake , for it was grounded in moral obtuseness. * Stephen Arnold Douglas was born in 1813 in Vermont . His father , a doctor , died when Douglas was an infant , and the boy was later apprenticed to a cabinetmaker . When his mother remarried he followed her to western New York , where he began to study law . At the age of twenty he went further west : to Ohio , Missouri , and finally Illinois . He was admitted to the bar before he was twenty-one and became a judge of the state supreme court at twenty-seven . Politics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere convenience for forwarding that career . In his youth he had seen politics at its height of organized efficiency in the New York state machine of Van Buren and Marcy . He grew up with the Democratic machine of Illinois , and he was one of the first to urge the creation of county and state conventions . He was soon a member of the state legislature and at the age of thirty he went to the House of Representatives at Washington . He was an odd figure : five feet tall , with weak little legs , a big round head , a bull neck , and the chest and shoulders of a wrestler . He had a voice that beat upon the air like the deep notes of a tuba . He was known as " the Little Giant . " Douglas distinguished himself in the House as an expansionist and a defender of the Mexican War . In 1847 the legislature of Illinois transferred him to the Senate , where he was at once made chairman of the Committee on Territories . The following year , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to property in North Carolina and Mississippi and to a hundred and fifty slaves . Douglas was accused of Southern sympathies as a result of the inheritance ; but his willingness to tempt the South with the repeal of the Missouri Compromise came not from sympathy but from rivalry . In 1847 Douglas moved north to the little village of Chicago which had been founded fourteen years before at the portage between the St. Lawrence ? Great Lakes waterway and the vast system of the Mississippi River . Jolliet and Marquette , exploring the wilderness for the King of France , had used this portage in 1673 and had urged the building of a canal . Their plan was accomplished in 1848 , the year after Douglas moved to Chicago . It seemed clear to the ambitious Senator that if the village which presided over this superb water connection were also to become the terminus of the Pacific railway , the future would be secure and affluent . So he invested in Chicago real estate and bribed the South to support his Nebraska bill . The South , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The idea of " popular sovereignty , " with its sugges- footnote * For the true dividing line between more and less than twenty inches of rain , sec the map on page 272.  | tion of democratic control , was displeasing to the fire-eaters and they would only accept it if combined with an explicit statement that the law of 1820 was dead . They could then make their final demand : that the federal government must protect slave property in the territories whether the inhabitants liked it or not . On January 22 , 1854 , a conference of Democratic leaders at the White House altered the bill to provide for open repeal and also to divide the land into two territories : one west of Missouri to be called Kansas and the other west of Iowa to be called Nebraska . Under pressure from Jefferson Davis and his friends President Pierce put the force of the Administration behind the Kansas-Nebraska Act . By so doing he assumed responsibility for the woe which followed . The Southerners who took part in this conference did not care what trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would be glad of the excuse to secede . But it is strange that none of the Northerners knew they were stirring the ugliest forces in American life : deep hates and fears which the most careful statesmanship had coaxed into a fitful sleep but which were now never to rest until the nation had been torn apart and rebuilt by the sword . Pierce may have been too dull to understand , and Marcy may have been disregarded , and Cushing was on the side of the Southern cause ; but how could Stephen A. Douglas have been fooled ? He knew politics the way a skilled mechanic knows the engine in his charge . He could take the machine to pieces , and put it together , and he loved each smooth well-fitting part ; but he did not sense that a political machine may have morals , and a soul , and even a heart . What remains mysterious , in even the most sympathetic view of his motives writes Professor Nevins , is his attitude toward free soil opinion ; an attitude curiously blind and callous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years the Missouri Compromise had truly been enshrined in Northern hearts . Did he not realize that any sudden attempt to overthrow it would raise the greatest storm of the generation ? . . . It was impossible for such a man to comprehend the fervent emotion with which millions of freedom-loving Northerners regarded the possibility that half the great West might become a land of slaves ? for devote Kansas to slavery , and Colorado , New Mexico , and Arizona ( to use present-day names ) might all conceivably follow . When indignation welled up like the ocean lashed by a hurricane he was amazed . The fact that the irresistible tidal forces in history are moral forces always escapes a man of dim moral perceptions . ' The New England men of letters who molded and expressed the conscience of their region doubtless seemed silly to the proud Senator who knew all there was to know about handling Congress and bullying weak Presidents . Lowell and Melville and Whittier , Emerson and Thoreau ? it was easy to dismiss them as sentimentalists when it came to framing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men spoke for more than half the country , and that their moralizings were backed in Congress by some of the most relentless fighters ever to perturb those contentious halls . Even before the Kansas-Nebraska Bill was presented to the Senate , six members of Congress issued an attack which , for timeliness , for bitterness , and for scornful insolence , has not been surpassed . This " Appeal of the Independent Democrats in Congress to the People of the United States " was chiefly the work of Senator Salmon P. Chase of Ohio ? soon to become a member of Lincoln 's Cabinet ; but it was also signed by Senator Sumner of Massachusetts and by four members of the lower House . The " Appeal " was exaggerated in its wrath , unfair in its ascription of motives , and an ugly forecast of the wild words and wilder deeds to come . Yet Professor Binkley calls it " the most successful single piece of propaganda in American party history , " and Senator Beveridge wrote that " its inflammable sentences fell like sprays of oil upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every northern community . " 4 Douglas was burnt in effigy throughout the Northern and Northwestern states , and every day the village churches and the town halls were filled with anxious men and women forming anti-Nebraska groups under a variety of names . They were all soon to coalesce in the Republican Party . Douglas had known , of course , that he would be attacked by the abolitionists ; but he did not foresee that his Kansas-Nebraska Act would make abolitionism respectable . The men who signed the " Appeal " were extremists who had little hold on the nation until Douglas made them popular . Their document was reprinted in every important newspaper throughout the North . Clergymen read the " Appeal " from their pulpits . Men who had thought that the doctrines of abolition were almost treason began to wonder whether slavery was indeed a system which must grow and grow , corrupting the continent , if it were permitted to live at all . So instead of sweeping from his path a few wild and well-tried enemies whom he despised , and at whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which wondered whether it had laughed unwisely . The extravagance of the " Appeal , " however , and the inaccuracy of many of its statements , and the answering bitterness which it roused in Southerners who might not otherwise have come to Douglas 's support , gave the Administration its chance to carry Congress . This was to prove a bitter and contaminated victory ; but at the time Douglas only saw that Chase had called him a liar , a man who sold his honor for the hope of the presidency , so he leaped gladly into battle . All through the month of February , 1854 , he defended his bill with superb address . If the moral issues and the resulting emotions were ignored , he had a strong case . His opponents had put themselves in the wrong and he hammered them with-  | out pity . Before he was through he had extracted an apology from Chase , and half an apology from Seward . Even Sumner was reduced to silence , the only form of politeness which he knew . And Douglas 's power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress to forget the storms that were rising through the country . The Senate passed the bill on March 3 , and the House on May 22 by 113 votes to 100 . The President meekly signed . " Douglas , " wrote Salmon P. Chase at the beginning of the struggle , " . . . has out-southernized the South ; and has dragged the timid and irresolute administration along with him . " 5 In the course of defending his Act before the people of Illinois , Douglas had his first disquieting encounter with Abraham Lincoln . On October 4 in Springfield , and on October 16 in Peoria , Lincoln took the Douglas arguments to pieces and exposed them as callously unmoral . When a politician appeals to morals the public expects intolerance and overstatement , and perhaps a harsh demand for some reform which would involve setting the world on its head . So the public tends to be suspicious . As Big Tim Sullivan of Tammany Hall said in his gentle way , " God and the people hate a chesty man . " But no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less intolerant , or more cautiously conservative . He could use moral arguments humbly and simply ( he could even use them unfairly at times ) , and because his soul was not swollen the people would listen . I think I have no prejudice against the southern people said Lincoln in his reply to the well-polished defenses of Douglas . They are just what we would be in their situation . If slavery did not now exist among them , they would not introduce it . If it did now exist among us , we should not instantly give it up . . . . If all earthly power were given me , I should not know what to do , as to the existing institution . . . . But all this , to my judgment , furnishes no more excuse for permitting slavery to go into our free territory , than it would for reviving the African slave trade by law . The law which forbids the bringing of slaves from Africa ; and that which has so long forbid the taking of them to Nebraska , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the repeal of the former could find as plausible excuses as that of the latter . . . . But Nebraska is urged as a great Union-saving measure . Well , I too , go for saving the Union . Much as I hate slavery , I would consent to the extension of it rather than see the Union dissolved , just as I would consent to any great evil , to avoid a greater one . But when I go to Union saving , I must believe , at least , that the means I employ have some adaptation to the end . To my mind , Nebraska has no such adaptation .  | " It hath no relish of salvation in it . " It is an aggravation , rather , of the only one thing which ever endangers the Union . When it came upon us , all was peace and quiet . . . . In the whole range of possibility , there scarcely appears to me to have been any thing , out of which the slavery agitation could have been revived , except the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Repeal the Missouri Compromise ? repeal all compromises ? repeal the Declaration of Independence ? repeal all past history , you still can not repeal human nature . It still will be the abundance of man 's heart , that slavery extension is wrong ; and out of the abundance of his heart , his mouth will continue to speak . . . . In our greedy chase to make profit of the Negro , let us beware lest we " cancel and tear to pieces " even the white man 's charter of freedom . . . . Let us turn slavery from its claim of " moral right " back upon its existing legal rights , and its arguments of necessity . Let us return it to the position our fathers gave it , and there let it rest in peace . . . . Iee his Senator Douglas 's view , the question of whether a new country shall be slave or free is a matter of as utter indifference as it is whether his neighbor shall plant his farm with tobacco or stock it with horned cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is certain that the great mass of mankind take a totally different view . They consider slavery a great moral wrong ; and their feeling against it is not evanescent , but eternal . It lies at the very foundation of their sense of justice : and it can not be trifled with . It was to " the great mass of mankind " that Lincoln spoke . He seemed to muse aloud , arguing with himself , seeking firm ground in a slippery world . Yet he was a deadly opponent , for while putting the worst possible construction on the pro-Nebraska arguments , he tested them by the principles of the American Revolution , by the faith in natural law on which the nation rested . More than six years later , on his way to his first inauguration , after the Deep South had seceded and formed the Confederate States of America , Lincoln spoke at Independence Hall in Philadelphia . All the political sentiments I entertain he said have been drawn , so r far as I have been able to draw them , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world from this hall . I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from . . . the Declaration of Independence . . . . It was that which gave promise that in due time the weight would be lifted from the shoulders of all men . . . . I would rather be assassinated on the spot than surrender it . ' Here , indeed , was a new note , a relief from the logic-chopping about states ' rights and property rights . Here was the combination of moral fervor and conservatism that Lincoln was to make his own . Slayerywae wrong because the Declaration of Independence was right . Nothing , therefore , could justify a permission for slavery to extend . Yet slavery ex-  | isted , and no man knew how to end it wisely , so nothing could justify the hate-provoking rant of the abolitionists . In the Peoria speech Lincoln said : Some men , mostly Whigs , who condemn the repeal of the Missouri Compromise , nevertheless hesitate to go for its restoration , lest they be thrown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old Whig to tell them good humoredly that I think this is very silly ? Stand with anybody that stands RIGHT . Stand with him while he is right and part with him when he goes wrong . Stand WITH the abolitionist in restoring the Missouri Compromise ; and stand AGAINST him when he attempts the repeal of the fugitive slave law . . . . In both cases you are right . . . . In both you stand on middle ground and hold the ship level and steady . In both you are national and nothing less than national . If the Presidents of the United States had taken this stand strongly , from 1853 onwards , the federal system might not have collapsed . But instead of morals and firm conservatism the Presidents tried expediency tempered by sudden deeds of rashness . The first fruit of this policy was " Bleeding Kansas . " As soon as Douglas 's ill-fated bill became law the sectional struggle for the territory of Kansas began . Slaveholders from Missouri ( and to a small extent from the whole South ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar institution , " while free settlers poured in from the old Northwest . In New England emigrant-aid societies were formed to finance the anti-slavery migration ? which for the most part went to the Kansas Valley , while the Missourians and other Southerners took their land along the Missouri River. * In November , 1854 , there was an election for a territorial delegate to Congress , and the following spring for a territorial legislature . Much illegal voting took place on both sides ; but the Missourians had the advantage of living next door , so the pro-slavery group won both elections . The results were not accepted by public opinion . " Squatter sovereignty " could not fraudulently settle a problem on which the passions of the nation were aroused . Later , when the anti-slavery Northerners had attained a clear majority , they sought admission to the Union as a free state . This was blocked by Southern members of Congress , and the bitter feeling in that body led to Sumner 's speech , " The Crime Against Kansas . " Charles Sumner of Massachusetts had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a learned man , footnote * See map , page 212.  | handsome and cold and bitter . He was the hero of the abolitionists in New England , and his life was a picture of the wrong way to bring morals into politics . He was the opposite of Lincoln : intolerant , cocksure , humorless , and hate-ridden . High principles , for Sumner , were not an incentive to understand and pity his neighbor , but an excuse for calling those who disagreed with him bad names . In the Kansas speech he outdid himself . The Slave Power was accused of all the crimes which Sumner could remember from his classical and historical reading . This the Senators expected , and received with a minimum of resentment . But in his long rhetorical peroration he turned from the abuse of regions and institutions to the abuse of men ? especially Douglas , and the much-loved Senator Butler of South Carolina , whom he accused of being a liar and a fool . Three days later Senator Butler 's nephew , Preston Brooks , a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his desk , striking him many times on the head with a cane . Sumner was badly hurt and was unable to attend the Senate for several years . In his absence the Massachusetts legislature re-elected him , and the empty desk at Washington did more harm to the Southern cause than the loud selfsatisfied words had ever done . Yet Brooks became a hero throughout the South . A Richmond newspaper referred to this " elegant and effectual caning , " while in the North mass meetings described the deed as barbarism . The two regions could no longer comprehend each other . Meanwhile , matters in Kansas grew rapidly worse . Douglas blamed the fraud and the fighting ( the breakdown of his hopes for popular sovereignty ) on the organizations in distant states which sought by promoting immigration to control the destiny of Kansas . He might have blamed his own folly for not knowing that when national passions were aroused the decision would never be left to temporary local majorities . For a short time the Missourians might flood across the border and falsify every election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made years before by the population figures , and the North did not intend to see that decision challenged . In Nebraska , where there was no hope of Southern control , popular sovereignty worked smoothly , and , as Douglas pointed out , " the stream of immigration was permitted to flow in its usual and natural channels . " But the unhappy first settlers in Kansas lived at the center of stresses which were nation-wide and which they could not hope to control . Proslavery men might burn and riot , and the mad John Brown might seek to promote God 's vengeance by murdering five Southerners ; but the decisions had been made elsewhere and were enforced by a majority which could not be slain . The battle for Kansas was really won in 1787 when the men who formed the Ohio Company petitioned the Congress of the Confederation for an ordinance which would forever forbid slavery in the old Northwest . As a result of that brave beginning there were too many free-  | soil states by 1855 , and too many willing free-soil pioneers , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the battle for Kansas , and a decisive factor in the Civil War which that battle foreshadowed , was the development of the east-west railway lines . In 1852 the United States had less than 11,000 miles of railway ; in 1860 it had more than 30,000 . And most of the new lines were tying the Northwest and the Middle West to the East , contradicting the river system which had long tied the West to the South . By 1855 the eastern seaport towns of New York , Philadelphia , and Baltimore had built railways across the mountain barrier of the Alleghenies into the great central valley . These lines ran north of the Ohio River , and as soon as they had pierced the mountains they began reaching farther into the Middle West , the Northwest ? and always at the end of the rainbow lay the Pacific . On Washington 's Birthday in 1854 , there was celebrated at Rock Island , Illinois , the opening of through traffic from the Mississippi River to the Atlantic Ocean . Here was a railroad to take Free-Soil settlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South . The burst of railway-building which changed the habits of the nation during the eighteen-fifties was made possible by federal land grants and by abundant immigrant labor . In 1850 Senator Douglas and his Illinois delegation in Congress passed a law setting aside tracts of public land for the encouragement of railway expansion . The Illinois Central Railroad was given two and a half million acres , and within four years it had built a line from Chicago in the north of the state to Cairo at the junction of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers . There was no bridge across the broad Ohio at that point , so the new line did not tie southern Illinois to Kentucky but to the fabulous city of Chicago . In 1850 Chicago was not on the railway at all ; in 1855 it was the terminus of 2200 miles of new roads and had become one of the largest grain-exporting towns in the world . By 1856 five lines ran from Chicago to the Mississippi River , diverting the traffic of Iowa , Minnesota , Wisconsin , Missouri , Central Illinois ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the new west-east route of the railways . Situated at the southern tip of Lake Michigan , which bounds the prairies like a wall three hundred miles long , Chicago with her railways became a natural center for lake traffic as well . " The parallels , " writes Allan Nevins , " had conquered the meridian lines of commerce . Had the South developed its manufactures , had New Orleans pushed its railroads to the northward energetically , had St. Louis flung a line into Iowa , the story might have been different . As it was , by 1860 the Northwest and Northeast marched aim in arm : " The South had not been pushed aside without a struggle . By 1858 Memphis on the Mississippi had been joined to Charleston on the Atlantic , and also to Richmond . And as early as the eighteen-thirties a heroic effort  | had been made to build a road from Charleston to Louisville and to Cincinnati , thus tying the Deep South to the Middle West and eventually to the Northwest . But the panic of 1837 with the accompanying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was one of the chief promoters , frustrated the plan . This was a disaster for the Southeast . Hayne 's Louisville , Cincinnati and Charleston Railway Company might have prevented the isolation of that section and kept alive its strong nationalist tradition . But the attempt was made before the era of federal land grants ; Northern capital was not interested and Southern capital was not available in the needed quantities . The slave system was failing economically as well as in the moral sphere. * An unforeseen result of the Kansas-Nebraska Act was the welding together of all who opposed the spread of slavery into a new Republican Party ? a party " sectional in membership , national in politics , " as Senator Beveridge called it , " a combination of moral and economic forces , of ancient partisanship and racial prejudice , of industrial philosophy and religious exaltation . " We have already seen that the Whig Party was dying and that effective leadership in the Democratic Party had passed to the pro-Southern group-either real Southerners like Davis , or " northern men with southern principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caleb Cushing and President Pierce . The materials were at hand for a new alliance of interests and ambitions ; but before the Republicans could seize the chance there arose from the general shifting and disintegrating of allegiances a brief but sinister party known as Native Americans , or KnowNothings . The immense increase in immigration which came in the forties and fifties led naturally to " nativist " movements . Most of the new immigrants were Germans or Irish , and most of the Germans and Irish were Catholics . To the fear of the foreigner was added the fear of a strange religion . The Irish , who were adroit politicians , settled mostly in the large footnote * The era of federal land grants , which began with Douglas 's coup in 1850 , continued until long after the Civil War and produced some of the thorniest problems in American history .

Between 1851 and 1858 the federal government gave twenty-one million acres of land to railway corporations in the Mississippi Valley . This , as we shall see , was but a small beginning . The proposed Louisville , Cincinnati and Charleston Railway route is shown on the map on page 372 . The route is now used by the Southern Railroad .  | Eastern cities where the Democratic Party had long been the party of the poor ; their political abilities thus became an affront to the Whigs , predisposing that moribund coalition to join with the nativists . The laxness with which immigration laws were administered in the seaport towns added sensible grievances to those of mere jealousy and meanness . New Orleans was even worse than New York in encouraging Europe , not only to Give me your tired , your poor , Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free , but quite literally to send " the wretched refuse of your teeming shore " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * So the first successful Native American Party started in Louisiana in 1841 . The movement spread north under a variety of names ? " Sons of ' 76 , " " Druids , " " Foresters , " and the like ? electing a mayor in New York and a Congressman in Philadelphia in 1844 . In 1852 and 1853 these quaintly named and pernicious bands came together into a national party , calling itself the Native Americans or the Order of the Star-Spangled Banner . The rest of the country called it the Know-Nothing Party , because it was said to be a secret order whose members were sworn to answer all questions with the words , " I know nothing about it . " Know-Nothings were pledged to vote only for " natives , " to demand that immigrants should spend twenty-one years in the country before they could become naturalized , and to work against the influence of the Catholic Church . For a few years it seemed as if they might draw a national majority into their strange and novel net . Prohibitionists had a tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big cities , and the German Catholics who were filtering into the Middle West , regarded prohibition as a form of insanity . Anti-slavery men in the North had a weakness for KnowNothings because the newest immigrants , being the poorest of the poor , could usually be stirred to oppose emancipation . The immigrants who moved West to the land became staunchly anti-slavery ; but those who stayed in the slums of the big Eastern cities preferred to have some class of Americans whose lot w7 clearly inferior to their own . And the rich conservative Whigs , the class-conscious followers of Webster , the Lords of the Loom who had long been in alliance with the Lords of the Lash , and footnote * On the base of the Statue of Liberty in New York Harr are the following lines by Emma Lazarus : " Keep , ancient lands , your storied pomp !

"  | in general all " sound " men of property , had a tendency to look with alarm at the unkempt foreigners who were flooding the land. * Among their other shortcomings , many immigrants were suspected of " radical " ideas derived from the revolutionary fervor of Europe 's 1848 . So a temporary alliance was formed out of the anti-drink , anti-slave , antiradical , and anti-immigrant enthusiasms . It was not a true basis for an American political party , because none of the groups had anything to offer in the way of bargains or concessions . Each wanted its own peculiar way , with the result that the party was far too rigid . As soon as this was proved in action , the Know-Nothings disintegrated ; but meanwhile they astonished the nation with their success . In 1854 they won control of Massachusetts and Delaware , and in alliance with the Whigs carried Pennsylvania . About seventy-five Congressmen elected that year had Know-Nothing affiliations . In 1855 the Know-Nothings elected nine governors. ** But the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the question of slavery and the Nebraska Act . Southern delegates insisted on endorsing the Act , with the result that twelve Northern states seceded and demanded the restoration of the Missouri Compromise , thus moving toward the program of the infant Republican Party . In 1856 poor harmless Millard Fillmore became the presidential candidate of the Southern Know-Nothings . He received 875,000 votes and carried only the state of Maryland . Thus ended the party of intolerance , the party described by one indignant Southern believer in freedom of religion as a " stupendous and far-reaching leprosy . " The year 1856 also saw the end of the Whigs , whose dejected remnant had held a convention in Baltimore in September and had endorsed Fillmore as the candidate least likely to disturb the peace of the nation .

The Republicans could make no place for the nativist or the pro-slavery e*ments of that abortive coalition ; but they found room for all the others . Professor Binkley describes the party in its youth as " an aggregation of Free-Soilers , Independent Democrats , Conscience Whigs , footnote * Some of this latter group would soon be encouraging immigration in order to keep down the price of labor . ** They won the states of Rhode Island , New Hampshire , Massachusetts , Connecticut , New York , Pennsylvania , Maryland , Kentucky , California .  | Know-Nothings , Barnburners , abolitionists , teetotalers. " 8 We have seen each of these groups in action independently ; we must now trace how they came together for victory , what bargains they made with one another , and what prizes they offered to the professional leaders without whom a lasting party is impossible . In February , 1854 , several months before the Kansas-Nebraska Bill was passed ( but a month after it had been reported to the Senate ) , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met at Ripon , Wisconsin , and resolved if this measure was pushed through the Congress " to throw old party organizations to the winds and organize a new party on the sole basis of the non-extension of slavery . " They claimed to be the true descendants of Jefferson , who had backed the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 whereby slavery was banished from the land north of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi . So they took the name of Jefferson 's party and called themselves Republicans . Five months later , after the hated bill had become law , an anti-Nebraska state convention at Jackson , Michigan , chose the same name for the same reasons . And on July 13 , the sixtyeighth anniversary of the Northwest Ordinance , state conventions in Indiana , Ohio , Vermont , and Wisconsin accepted the new name and demanded a party pledged to prevent the extension of slavery . Thus far the movement was merely one branch of the widespread agitation against the Nebraska Bill . Few would have predicted the birth of a new major party . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KnowNothings would take their place . One of the first to sense the true drift was Thurlow Weed of New York , the old political master . After the defeat of the Democrats in the midterm election of 1854 , Weed guessed that in the victorious coalition the infant Republican Party would outlast the Know-Nothings , the Conscience Whigs , and the other anti-Nebraska groups . He began to maneuver his New York Whig machine toward the camp of the future conquerors . This was clever of Weed , for at the time it still seemed to most observers that the Republicans must fail for lack of a national leader . Salmon P. Chase of Ohio , whose " Appeal of the Independent Democrats " had lighted the raging anti-Nebraska fires , was not acceptable to Whig converts , for he had attacked them too often and too bitterly . Sumner of Massachusetts was so steeped in moral superiority at he could never head a popular movement . Seward of New York vas disliked by the Know-Nothing converts , because under the expert gu ante of Weed he had befriended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from the Democratic Party . And Abraham Lincoln had not yet even joined the Republicans . His deep conservatism , and his distaste for the abolitionists , kept him among the dwindling Whig forces until 1856.  | Another handicap for the Republicans was their taint of eccentricity and " reform . " In this they were most unlike their predecessors , the worldly Whigs , who were never connected with anything socially odd . At first the more conservative Whigs turned their backs on these curious people who consorted with prohibitionists , and even abolitionists . Furthermore , with lie help of Horace Greeley and his New York Tribune ( whose European cirespondent was Karl Marx ) , Northern labor began to join the Republican camp . And as the Democrats under Southern leadership became more conservative , the Republicans won converts from the radical wing of that party : the Locofocos , and the Barnburners , and the so-called " heirs of Jackson " under the leadership of Jackson 's friend and party editor , Francis P. Blair . Blair was the permanent chairman of the first Republican National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a member of the first Republican National Committee . All this was not enough to make a victorious party , as the election of 1856 showed . The Republicans , so far , were scarcely more than a reshuffle of the Know-Nothing coalition , with labor taking the place of the fanatical " nativists . " Since this was a Northern-and-Western sectional party , which could count on the united hostility of the South , it could not afford to lose the populous states in its own region . Yet it had nothing in its program or its membership to appeal to the business interests of New York , Pennsylvania , and Massachusetts ( who were certain to be suspicious of the appeals to labor ) , and nothing to win the farmers in the southern fringe of Middlewestern states , along the Ohio Valley , many of whom were Southern by blood and most of whom traded with the slave society . By 1860 , a combination of good luck and superb political leadership had repaired this weakness ; but in 1856 it seemed as if the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Democratic National Convention met at Cincinnati in June , 1856 . The candidates for the nomination were President Pierce , James Buchanan , Lewis Cass , and Stephen A. Douglas . The two-thirds rule was maintained . Although at the end of his first term the President in office can normally control the convention , Pierce failed completely . He began with almost as many votes as Buchanan , but after a few ballots his Southern friends began to desert him for Douglas . The Kansas-Nebraska Bill which had brought such woe to the country had been intended to flatter i the South , and the South now sought to repay its author . But Northern hostility to Douglas was too great . The North stood steadily for Buchanan , and since he was known to be another " doughface , " another Northern  | man with Southern principles , the South was happy to take him as a compromise . Like Pierce , he was pliable ; but unlike Pierce he was prudent , and it was thought he could be counted on to do nothing , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy desired by the South and by the Northern conservative converts to the Democratic Party . James Buchanan was a Pennsylvanian , born in 1791 of Scotch-Irish stock . He went to a local school and to a small college , and like most politicians in America he studied law . After serving an apprenticeship in local politics he was sent to Congress by the Federalists in 1820 ? one of the last victories of that once-formidable party . A few years later he joined the Jackson men , retaining his place in Congress and helping to elect Andrew Jackson in 1828 . Thereafter he served as Minister to Russia , as United States Senator , and as Secretary of State to the dynamic James K. Polk during the years of expansion and of Manifest Destiny . When the Democrats returned to power in 1853 , Buchanan ( who had expected the presidency ) was sent as Minister to England . There he showed himself a disciple of the imperialist Polk by joining with the American Ministers at Madrid and Paris in signing the " Ostend Manifesto " of 1854 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a confidential report to the Department of State , in which Buchanan and his fellow ministers argued that if Spain refused to sell Cuba ( for which the Pierce Administration was willing to offer $130,000,000 ) , the United States would be justified in " wresting " the island from its owners . When the " Manifesto " became public the Administration was embarrassed ; but the South , which had long coveted Cuba , was pleased to find in Buchanan another amiable " doughface " who might be counted on to take orders from the Southern Demo " " c ats " at least as humbly as Pierce and perhaps more efficiently . The feelings of Spain were ignored . These were the great days of the pax Britannica . Secure behind the British fleet , American politicians could forget politeness , convention , and all the normal usages of foreign relations , abusing or flattering the sovereign states or the revolutionary factions of Europe with no thought beyond the next election . Later , in a less safe world , the habit of a hundred years proved hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in June . There was no " logical candidate , " for the party had no national leader .

Since they were a sectional party , the Republicans were not forcec t , snake the usual concessions to unity . Their chief problem was to keep t e abolitionists from spoiling the party 's chances , even in the North . There was a tone to the meeting that the more professional and nationally representative conventions lacked . The Philadelphia scene had a pristine freshness , a bright hopefulness , an evangelistic verve which made it wonderfully refreshing . Its debates throbbed with feeling ? its speeches struck fire .

' " This did not sound like a broad enough base for a national coalition . The Republicans still looked like the typical " third party , " with one main excellent idea . They might have remained a third party , and have faded as such parties fade , except that the demise of the Whigs had left many experienced professionals without a job , organizers in search of something to organize . Before long they had shown the Republicans how to spread a wider net , and how to avoid losing old converts while gaining new and contradictory ones .

The first half of his life was mostly romance and success , the last half a long and sometimes sordid anticlimax . And 1856 was the dividing line . Fremont was the illegitimate son of a Frenchman who taught school in Richmond , Virginia , and a Mrs. Pryor of that city . Brave , good-looking , and energetic , Fremont was an adventurer who followed his destiny into adventure 's natural home : the unexplored West . A lieutenant in the United States topographical corps , he married Jessie Benton , who was almost as Byronic as himself . His powerful father-in-law , the Senator who had long wanted to seize the entire West , put him in charge of two exploring expeditions . Fremont 's reports , written with his wife 's masterly help , brought the Oregon Trail and the western mountains into splendid life for stay-at-home readers ? and incidentally they made Fremont a national hero . He played a dubious but popular part in the conquest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth ten million , dollars  | and a court-martial which in January , 1848 , found him guilty of " mutiny , disobedience , and conduct prejudicial to order . " The public was on his side ( the public and Thomas Hart Benton ) , so he resigned from the Army without discredit and devoted himself to further explorations , to European travel , to his adoring Jessie , and to a brief term in the United States Senate . When the Kansas fight began , he declared himself a Free-Soiler and an enemy of the Fugitive Slave Law . Since these were his only known views on politics he was a good candidate for the new party . " When the Republicans had made their choice , the Northerners who had left the Know-Nothings when the South insisted on a pro-slavery resolution met in convention , called themselves the North American Party , and endorsed Fremont . So there were three important candidates in 1856 : Buchanan and the Democrats ; Fremont and the Republican ? North Americans ; Fillmore and the Know-Nothings plus the remaining Whigs . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Buchanan carried nineteen states with 174 electoral votes , Fremont eleven states with 114 electoral votes . Buchanan received 1,838,169 popular votes , Fremont 1,341,364. * New England and New York and the northern Middle West had gone to the Republicans ; but Pennsylvania , New Jersey and the southern counties of Indiana , and Illinois had stayed with Buchanan , and of course the entire South ? and California , which had its own reasons for disliking Fremont and which Buchanan had wooed with the impossible promise of a Pacific railway at once . The victory was for conservatism , for dodging trouble , for the Union and for peace , even if peace meant appeasement . The prediction made to Howell Cobb by his farsighted friend had come true : one more rally of all the forces of conservatism and compromise had produced one more victory for the Democrats . What would they do with this , their last chance ? footnote * So Buchanan had 59 per cent of the vote in the electoral college but only 45 per cent of the popular vote . Fremont had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent .  | ACCORDING TO THE STANDARDS of the twentieth century Buchanan 's campaign was a simple affair ; but at the time it seemed elaborate , costly , and perhaps corrupt . The candidate stayed at home in Lancaster , Pennsylvania , seeing visitors and answering letters . The Democratic National Committee appointed a sub-committee to raise money and a so-called " resident committee " in Washington to write pamphlets and send out speakers ? and if necessary indulge in modest bribery . The Republicans , meanwhile , broke the painfully learned rules of federal politics by taking a positive stand . There were no compromises in their program , no vague words , no attempts to occupy several contradictory positions at the same time . The Republicans could be brave because they were a sectional party ? and because they were young . The Democrats , who were neither , felt that such tactics were unfair . Also , the Democrats were fighting themselves . Their party had repudiated a first-term President . On the good and sensible grounds that he was incompetent , the machine had turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony between the friends of Buchanan and the friends of Pierce . And it did not promise peace within the state organizations when the new Administration came to distributing jobs . In fact , the fierce quarrels which ensued consumed much of the attention and energy which might have been given to the problem of preserving the Union Buchanan saw himself inaccurately , as a politician of rich experience and wisdom ; He had been in public service for almost forty-two years and he mistakenly believed that he had been learning a that time . He was distressed at the planless discord of the Pierce Administration . He felt that as soon as his own trained hand took the helm there would be no more yawing and jibing . Added to this confidence in his political powers was a deeper and truer self-distrust which plagued Buchanan all his life . He never married and he never had an intimate friend of either sex . He took refuge from personal relations in a dignity which seemed put on , like a suit of armor , instead of being an expression of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , a high collar and broad white neckcloth , he was pompous rather than impressive , stubborn rather than resolute . And underneath the layers of rotection he was timid . When hard-pressed his refuge was irresolution. t is a pity that at the age of sixty-six , after ten years of ill health , at a troublesome time in his country 's history , he should have insisted upon pushing himself into the president . Buchanan did not know it was a bad time . He thought a little sound management would bring peace and quiet ? an opinion which alone was enough to convict him of overconfidence , obsolescence , and thorough misreading of the country 's mood , North or South . As a first step toward sound management he sought to build a Cabinet which would have none of the faults of Pierce 's mismated team . He wanted all the regions of the country represented , but not all the quarreling groups within the party . He rightly interpreted the election as a victory for conservatism , and he planned a strong conservative Administration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know many strong conservatives . For Secretary of State Buchanan took the aging Lewis Cass of Michigan , who was about to leave the Senate . We have seen Cass as an extreme American imperialist and a hater of England . Buchanan did not like him or trust him ; indeed , he made it a condition of the appointment that Cass should suppress his anti-British feelings and accept an assistant whom the President would name and who was to do all the work . Presumably , Cass took the appointment on such terms because he was too old to care for anything except employment . " At seventy-four , " writes Professor Nichols , " senility was creeping up on the obese , indolent Lewis Cass . . . . He was a constant trial as an adviser , because he could not make up his mind and was glad to be made the mouthpiece of others . " 1 The Postmaster General , who controlled most of the patronage , was a Southerner with little national experience but a good knowledge of what the South wanted . The Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful never to disagree with Buchanan and who did no noticeable harm . The Secretary of War was ex-Governor Floyd of Virginia , a bigoted states ' - rights man of good family . " He was not particularly intelligent , energetic , efficient , or interested . . . " says Professor Nichols ; " Careless ' is the word that describes him . Buchanan was to have many anxious moments because of Floyd 's unfitness for his position . " 2 The Secretary of the Interior was a narrow-minded self-made Mississippian who had forced his way to success during the early unregulated youth of the state . The Attorney General was a Scotch-Irish Pennsylvanian ? the one effective man in the Cabinet who was neither a Southerner nor a " doughface . " And the Secretary of the Treasury was the charming Howell Cobb of Georgia , the baby of the Cabinet , only forty-one years old . He had many virtues and talents , but a knowledge of finance was not among  | them . A Union man from Georgia , a conservative who believed in the true spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administration ; but Buchanan was perhaps wrong to give him the Treasury . Next to the Post Office , that was the department most concerned with patronage ? and here Cobb must be a liability in his own region , for the fire-eaters hated him and whatever he did they would claim they were betrayed . and large , the Cabinet was a faithful mirror of the President . Most of it was old and unaware of the perilous mood of the country . None of it , with the exception of Cobb , was notably able . None of it co ld provide leadership at Cabinet meetings . If Buchanan went wrong there was no one to help . If he tried to evade decisions there was no one to compel action . It is pathetic to think of this tired , sick man , with his too dignified deportment masking the self-distrust which kept him from delegating power , working till late hours night after night in the White House , poring over a multitude of papers which he insisted on reading but which he failed to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the verge of long period of internal peace . Everything was working out well . There was no longer any reason for a sectional party , such as the Republicans . He intended to allay , sectional strife and to make the Union secure forever . He also recommended economy , the payment of the public debt , and an increase in the Navy . On military grounds he recommended building a " road " to California ( presumably the railroad of his campaign promise to that state ) , so that soldiers and supplies could move easily ; but he gave no hint as to how to break the deadlock in Congress between the friends of Jefferson Davis 's southern route and the friends of Douglas 's Nebraska route . In general , the address proved Buchanan a strict-constructionist who refused to assume leadership even in such a vital political question as the tariff . " ' In foreign affairs , though he talked of peace and friendship , he managed to suggest that he still favored Southern expansion ? presumably toward the Caribbean ? from which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Inaugural Address dealt with footnote * Buchanan went further than any President since Monroe in praise of strict construction and a weak government . In a letter written in 1852 he said that the " ancient principles of 1798 " in Virginia could alone save the country from wasteful extravagance and from a loose interpretation of the central powers . This is Jefferson before he came to office ; this is John Randolph and the " old Republicans . " This is nostalgia for the innocent youth of the nation ? charming , but inadequate for a chief executive during the fateful fifties .  | Kansas , slavery , and the territories . The whole explosive question , said the President , was now " happily a matter of but little practical importance , " because the Supreme Court would soon " speedily and finally " settle it . " T eir decision , in common with all good citizens , I shall cheerfully submit . " This was an odd statement from a follower of Andrew Jackson , who had denied the power of the Court to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from anyone who had watched the dire effects of the Kansas-Nebraska Act , the rise of the Republican Party , and the clear repeated proof that the North would accept no decision , by President , Congress , or Court , which allowed slavery to spread beyond the Missouri Compromise line . On this issue Buchanan was s morally insensitive as Douglas ? and as politically blind ? if he thought a group of judges could calm the storm . And his statement was odd for still another reason . He said he would " cheerfully submit " to the decision of the Court , and he exhorted all good citizens " to do the same . The implication was clear that he would obey the Court whatever it might rule in the pending Dred Scott case . e did not add that he had been told what the ruling would be . Dred Scott was a Negro slave in Missouri who sued for his freedom on the ground that with the consent of his master he had lived for years in Illinois and in the unorganized territory across the Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compromise or by the Northwest Ordinance . This was a familiar type of case . Between 1822 and 1837 eight similar cases had been decided in favor of slaves ; but Dred Scott 's suit for freedom began in 1846 when the approaching Mexican War had already sharpened and made bitter all questions touching slavery . The case was heard and appealed and re-appealed , with judgment sometimes in Scott 's favor and sometimes against him , until at the end of six years it was carried to the federal courts . In 1854 the United States Circuit Court of Missouri ruled that since Scott was a Negro he was not a citizen of Missouri and not entitled to sue in federal courts . The case was then appealed to the United States Supreme Court . Six of the seven justices who formed the majority wrote individual opinions , coming on the whole to similar conclusions by a variety of routes . The opinion of Chief Justice Taney ? the most outrageous of all from the Northern point of view is commonly known as " the Dred Scott decision . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after the inauguration . Taney 's argument may be summarized under three headings : Fact , no Negro could be a citizen , since citizenship derived from the federal government , and at the time when the Constitution was adopted  | Negroes were regarded " as beings of an inferior order and altogether unfit to associate with the white race , either in social or political relations . " At that time , he added , Negroes " had no rights or privileges but such as those who held the power and the government might choose to grant them . " S rid , even if one dismissed the question as to whether a Negro could ever be a citizen , it was obvious that a slave could not be a citizen . Dred Scott was a slave . He had not become free by residence in territory covered by the Missouri Compromise , since the Missouri Compromise had been unconstitutional from the beginning . Congress had no power , while governing a territory , to interfere with the property of a slaveowner , any more than it could interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigs . " An act of Congress , " wrote Taney , " which deprives a citizen of the United States of his liberty or property , merely because he came himself or brought his property into a particular territory of the United States , and who had committed no offense against the laws , could hardly be dignified with the name of due process of law . " Therefore , since Dred Scott was still a slave he was not a citizen , and could not sue in the federal courts . The interesting part of this argument was that it not only made the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional but the Republican Party as well ? since that party was founded for the main purpose of preventing the spread of slavery into further territories . Third , even if one dismissed the question as to whether the Missouri Compromise could make Dred Scott free while he lived in territory north of 36 ? 30 ' , the fact remained that he had voluntarily returned to Missouri where his status was determined by Missouri law . The courts of Missouri had held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a citizen and could not sue in a federal court . The Northern press ? abolitionist and moderate Republican ? fell upon the Dred Scott decision with a howl of fury . The New York Tribune called it " this wicked and false judgment " made by " five slave-holders and two doughfaces , " and added that the decision was " entitled to just as footnote * In 1856 the Republican platform had anticipated Taney in his appeal to the " due process " clause of the Fifth Amendment . But Taney emphasized the property which should not be taken from the master , whereas the Republicans emphasized the liberty which should not be taken from the man . " As our Republican fathers . . . " said the platform , " ordained that no person shall be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law , it becomes our duty to maintain this provision of the Constitution against all attempts to violate it for the purpose of establishing slavery in the territories of the United States . " As we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is one of the most ambiguous phrases in American history . When Professor Edward Corwin was a student he asked his teacher ( the famous Andrew McLaughlin ) what Taney meant by " due process " in the Dred Scott decision . " I do n't know , " said McLaughlin , and the young Corwin reflected that in that case nobody knew . He decided to try to find out . The results of his work appeared almost fifty years later in a fascinating book , Liberty Against Government : The Rise , Flowering and Decline of a Famous Juridical Concept .  | much moral weight as would be the judgment of a majority of those congregated in any Washington Barroom . " Taney was vilified throughout the North , and the six justices who agreed with him . It was accepted that they had made the Supreme Court an agent of Southern expansionism . No decision has ever done the Court more harm , or shown a more dangerous judicial ignorance of the mood of the day . Buchanan and the politically naive judges were disappointed in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a court decision . The Union was not saved but greatly endangered , for the rancorous discussion which followed made war more likely . Perhaps the only man who was clearly helped by the Dred Scott fiasco was Abraham Lincoln , whose combination of caution and simple inflexible morality was what the North wanted to hear . And the rough , insensitive Douglas soon gave Lincoln the ideal foil for his best qualities . Senator Douglas was asked by his constituents what had become of popular sovereignty , in the light of Dred Scott . He replied that popular sovereignty was untouched . Of course a citizen had a right to take his slaves to a territory ; but that was " a barren and worthless right unless sustained , protected , and enforced by appropriate police regulations and local legislation , prescribing adequate remedies for its violation. " * Unwisely ? perhaps lured by the pleasure of insisting that his Republican enemies were unconstitutional ? Douglas went on to praise the decision and to insist that what the Court said must be accepted . " Whoever resists the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " aims a deadly blow at our whole republican system of government . " This was the type of bombast that Lincoln enjoyed destroying . He quoted Andrew Jackson 's message disregarding the Supreme Court 's decision on the Bank , adding , " again and again have I heard Judge Douglas denounce that bank decision and applaud General Jackson for disregarding it . " He pointed out that the Supreme Court had often overruled its own decisions , and said the Republicans would do what they could to have it overrule this . Then he turned to his favorite problem : how to reconcile slavery and the Declaration of Independence . There had been a time when the Declaration was sacred . " But now , to aid in making the bondage of the Negro universal and eternal , it is assailed and sneered at and construed , and hawked at and torn , till , if its framers could rise from their graves , they could not at all recognize it . " What did the authors of the Declaration mean when they said all men were created equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 , 1857.  | They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society , which could be familiar to all , and revered by all . . . . The assertion that " all men are created equal " was of no practical use in effecting our separation from Great Britain ; and it was placed in the Declaration , not for that , but for future use . Its authors meant it to be , thank God , it is now proving itself , a stumbling block to those who in after times might seek to turn a free people back into the hateful paths of despotism . They knew the proneness of prosperity to breed tyrants , and they meant when such should reappear in this fair land and commence their vocation they should find left for them at least one hard nut to crack . The whole of this speech was printed in the New York Times . Lincoln was becoming a national figure . It was just a year since he had cautiously and with misgivings joined the Republican Party ? pushed by William Herndon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Illinois was to meet at Bloomington in May , 1856 . In April Herndon and a few friends called a county convention in Springfield to select local delegates . Although Lincoln was away attending court , Herndon signed his name to the call . Thus there came into the party the man who was to give it not only the most careful and expert political guidance , but also a soul . Buchanan 's luckless Administration , which had begun with the Dred Scott decision challenging Stephen A. Douglas on his favorite ground of popular sovereignty , soon found itself wholly at odds with that powerful and contentious Demo rat . In the autumn of 1857 a convention at Lecompton , Kansas , * attended solely by the pro-slavery minority in the territory , framed a constitution for a state government , to be submitted to the voters in a so-called referendum . The constitution contained an article declaring slave property inviolable . The voters might take the constitution with or without that article ; but they could not reject the constitution as a whole , and even if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property already in Kansas , and no amendment before 1865 . The free-state men in Kansas declined to vote , and on December 21 the constitution was approved , with slavery . In January , 1858 , the legislature ? in control of the Free Soil Party ? arranged for a referendum on the whole constitution . This time the pro-slavery men refused to vote and the constitution was rejected . After this fraud and confusion , and in spite of the clear will of the majority in Kansas , Buchanan recommended to Congress that it accept the Lecompton Constitution and admit Kansas as a slave state . Douglas had stated in December that he thought the Lecompton Constitution a travesty on popular  | sovereignty . When the Administration backed it , Douglas turned against Buchanan with all his implacable force . The President ? who had once expected to heal the party breaches made by the amateurish Pierce ? fought back . Douglas 's friends were turned out of office . Douglas himself was denied all further patronage . The party press attacked him with vicious abuse ? the Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic leader in the North had broken with the dominant pro-slavery faction , and the party seemed to lie in ruins . The Democratic state convention in Illinois stood firmly behind Douglas , who had built a local machine so strong that the President could not break it . Buchanan forced the Senate to accept the Lecompton Constitution ; but Douglas ( with the help of the Republicans and a few Know-Nothings ) contrived its defeat in the House . The torn , unhappy territory of Kansas did not become a state until January 1861 . In the midst of this warfare Douglas sought re-election to the Senate . Eastern Republicans wished to widen the split in the Democratic Party by endorsing Douglas ; but Illinois Republicans said it was " asking too much for human nature to bear , to now surrender to Judge Douglas . . . to quietly let him step foremost in our ranks and make us all take back seats . " 3 So they put forward their own party candidate : Abraham Lincoln of Springfield . Douglas was in Washington when he heard the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strong man of his party ? full of wit , facts , dates ? and the best stump speaker , with his droll ways and dry jokes , in the West . " Magnanimously , since , Lincoln could command no such audiences as the " Little Giant , " Douglas accepted a challenge to debate in seven Congressional districts . As a result , Lincoln became a major national figure and a candidate for the presidency . In the debate at Freeport , Douglas was forced to restate his belief that in spite of the Dred Scott decision slavery could be kept out of the territories by police regulations . This set the Southern fire-eaters against him and led in 1860 to the break in the Democratic Party . For the rest , the debates are disappointing . They show the ability of both speakers to set traps and to avoid them . And they show that there was little difference between the candidates in regard to slavery . Both put the preservation of the Union above all other causes . Douglas believed that popular sovereignty would ensure freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln believed that popular sovereignty might never be given an honest chance and that the deep perturbation of the people could only be met by a prohibition against new slave lands . Before the debates began , Kansas had been saved from slavery by Douglas 's valiant fight against the Lecompton Constitution . Later , when the nation had broken , Douglas defended Lincoln in the  | Senate and stood strongly behind him in upholding the Union . The chief difference between them was whether the opposition to slave-expansion should be put on moral or on legal grounds . Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the debates was the number of problems which were ignored . The nation had just suffered a severe economic depression . Yet , as J. G. Randall points out , there was not a word about unemployment , the condition of factory workers , the tariff , immigration , railroads and federal land grants , homesteads and the protection of public lands against greedy plunder , agriculture , or banking , or any of the agrarian grievances which were soon to rend the nation . Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to hold the Illinois Republican Party together until other issues could be agreed upon , and until the loyalties arising from repeated campaigns could make themselves felt . He had to satisfy ( and to keep in a loose precarious alliance ) conservative Whigs like himself , abolitionists whom he regarded as a radical nuisance , Middlewestern Germans who distrusted Know-Nothings , and Know-Nothings who distrusted all immigrants . He divined that freedom in the territories was common ground , and from that he would not budge . Douglas was trapped and dared not introduce new issues , since Lincoln had already accused him of dodging and of inferior moral sense . In the election , Lincoln 's tactics almost succeeded . The Republicans won a majority of the votes , but only a minority of seats in the next state legislature . So in January , 1859 , when the two houses met in joint session , Douglas was elected Senator by fifty-four votes to forty-six . ' He returned to Washington to find himself an outcast in his own party , which was now wholly in the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Committee on Territories . Under pressure from Jefferson Davis ( who had returned to the Senate after the demise of the Pierce Administration ) he was soon forced to meet the Southern attack and to declare himself opposed to any federal protection for slave property in the territories . The split in the party was complete . It only needed to be ratified by the next national convention . 6 While Lincoln had been talking cautiously in Illinois , seeking a position which might keep Whigs and abolitionists united , and which might satisfy the North 's anxieties without provoking fear or rage among moderate Southerners , the Pennsylvanians had been making party policy with less footnote * The Senators , of course , were still chosen by the state legislatures under Article I , Section 3 of the Constitution . Lincoln and Douglas were canvassing for party , not personal , votes .  | restraint . They were concerned with business and the depression , not with the Declaration of Independence . The iron industry of Pennsylvania had been heavily hit . Manufacturers blamed the " doughface " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cobb to recommend and secure the passage of the Tariff of 1857 , which came close to making America a free-trade nation . The ironmakers won some support in Massachusetts , and from Greeley 's Tribune ; but Republicans on the whole still dodged protection as an election issue . So the hightariff men in Pennsylvania gave money and leadership to a local " People 's Party " ? a coalition of Republicans and anti-Buchanan Democrats . Refreshed by the rain of cash , the People 's Party , in 1858 , elected eighteen of the state 's twenty-five Congressmen . The Republicans were forced to pay heed , for they could not win in 1860 without Pennsylvania , and it was clear that they could not have Pennsylvania without protection . Reluctantly , they passed a tariff bill through the House of Representatives . It was defeated in the Senate ; but the new party now had a new cause. * And when , in the following year , President Buchanan vetoed a homestead bill on constitutional grounds , the long reluctance of Eastern busing , was overcome by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for free land . " Vote yourself a farm , " and " Vote yourself a tariff , " were campaign cries in 1860 . Lincoln , meanwhile , was trying to dissuade other party leaders from taking stands which might disrupt the Republicans before they had built a true national machine . His job , he said to a friend , was " to hedge against divisions in the Republican ranks generally and particularly for the contest of 1860 . " There were many such divisions which Lincoln , with his hard political sense , deplored . His worries during 1859 and 186c are an index to the problems of party-building in America . KnowNothing Republicans in one state , abolitionist Republicans in another , were an equal bother . Massachusetts Republicans wrote Lincoln should have looked beyond their noses , and then they could not have failed to see that tilting against foreigners would ruin us in the whole Northwest . New Hampshire and Ohio should forbear tilting against the Fugitive Slave law in such a way as to utterly overwhelm us in Illinois with the charges of enmity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she can be saved to freedom on " squatter sovereignty , " ought not to forget that to prevent the spread and nationalism of slavery is a national concern and must be attended to by the nation.4 footnote * The Republicans in this back-handed fashion were committed to one of the few policies which in the period after the Civil War distinguished them sharply from the Democrats . Until the days of Franklin Roosevelt , for reasons which will become clear , the Democrats on the whole wished lower tariffs than the Republicans ? although from 1865 onwards they were never again a free-trade party . p 391 While Lincoln was struggling to prevent the destruction of the Republican Party from within , America 's leading fanatic very nearly destroyed it from without . In the middle of October , 1859 , the furious John Brown declared private war on the institution of slavery and invaded the South with a tiny army of liberation . He intended a series of raids along the line of the Allegheny Mountains , liberating slaves and endowing the conquered territory with a government which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harper 's Ferry in Virginia ( now West Virginia ) was selected for the first attack . It was the site of an armory and arsenal , and it was a gateway to the South . Brown 's " army " consisted of seventeen white men and five Negroes . They may have hoped to stir a slave rebellion ; but nobody lifted a helping hand . The raiders were driven into a fire-engine house and there killed or captured by United States Marines under the command of Colonel Robert E. Lee and Lieutenant " Jeb " Stuart . John Brown and six other survivers were hanged at the near-by county seat. * The storm raised by this not very menacing foray was a sign of the tension under which the country lived . John Brown 's chief crime was that he killed a most promising movement for conciliation and the union which had developed during 1858 and 1859 in the border states , led by such men as Crittenden of Kentucky and Rives of Virginia . After the raid their work was discredited . The South , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurrection , enjoyed a shivering horror in recalling the bloody deeds of San Domingo . Northerners living in the South found themselves watched like enemy aliens . And in the North all the forces of conservatism threatened to turn against the Republican Party , which had reluctantly made room for the more conciliatory abolitionists , and some of whose national spokesmen ( such as Seward and Greeley ) might be blamed for inflaming the unbalanced mind of Brown . Many Northern writers and preachers were in favor of the raid ; but the politicians drew back , sensing that praise of John Brown meant the loss of the next election . And if the Republican candidate in 1860 did less well than Fremont in 1856 , the party would follow the Know-Nothings into oblivion . footnote * In his last speech John Brown denied that he had intended to incite slaves to murder . He said he only meant to set them free and take them away from Virginia . And , he added : " This court acknowledges , as I suppose , the validity of the law of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the Bible , or at least the New Testament . That teaches me that all things whatsoever I would that men should do to me , I should do even so to them . It teaches me , further , to remember them that are in bonds , as bound with them . ' I endeavored to act up to that instruction . . I am yet too young to understand that God is any respecter of persons . I believe that to have interfered as I have done ? as I have always freely admitted I have done ? in behalf of His despised poor , was not wrong , but right . . . . I feel no consciousness of guilt . "  | Ralph Waldo Emerson called Brown " a new saint awaiting his martyrdom , and who , if he shall suffer , will make the gallows glorious like the cross . " Thoreau called him " an angel of light , " and Wendell Phillips declared that he carried " letters of marque from God . " The politicians were less lyrical . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other in condemning the raid . They knew that John Brown had brought war closer , and that the people of America , though half-agreeing with the New England authors , did not choose to bleed in the cause of the Negro . Even Seward , whose " irrepressible conflict " and " higher law " had seemed to ask for violence , made a conciliatory speech in the Senate and for once refrained from denouncing slavery . And in February , 1860 , Lincoln visited New York City and talked so conservatively at the Cooper Institute that he himself said the people of the West were disappointed and he did not blame them . But an enthusiastic young Republican from Wall Street wrote to Lincoln : " You and your western friends , I think , underrate this speech . It has produced a greater effect here than any other single speech . It is the real platform in the eastern states , and must carry the conservative element in New York , New Jersey , and Pennsylvania . " 5 The speech concentrated once more on the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion that the Republicans had been  | so worldly as to consider a tariff for manufacturers , or the gift of free land to the settlers . And the control of slavery was discussed reassuringly , with an obvioas lack of rashness or of radical bias . The audience must have felt that a man with such sound common sense would of course agree with themselves on all unmentioned matters . The capacity to remove anxieties and at the same time to flatter the conscience was one of Lincoln 's leading assets . So far from being an angry and turbulent party , he said , friendly to disastrous follies such as John Brown 's raid , the Republicans asked only that the people of America return to the attitude toward slavery which was expressed by the fathers of the Constitution in the eighteenth century : As those fathers marked it , so let it again be marked , as an evil not to to be extended , but to be tolerated and protected only because of and so far as its actual presence among us makes that toleration and protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , be , not grudgingly , but fully and fairly , maintained . For this Republicans contend , and with this , so far as I know or believe , they will be content . Discussing the fears of the Southern people , he tried to be soothing and conciliatory . You say we Republicans have made the slavery question more prominent than it formerly was . We deny it . We admit that it is more prominent , but we deny that we made it so . It was not we , but you , who discarded the old policy of the fathers . We resisted , and still resist , your innovation ; and thence comes the greater prominence of the question . Would you have that question reduced to its former proportions ? Go back to that old policy . What has been will be again , under the same conditions . If you would have the peace of the old times , readopt the precepts and policy of the old times . Finally , he made a strong plea for the Union ? which to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business relations between North and South . A few words now to Republicans said Lincoln . It is exceedingly desirable that all parts of this great Confederacy shall be at peace , and in harmony , one with another . Let us Republicans do our part to have it so . Even though much provoked , let us do nothing through passion and ill temper . Even though the southern people will not so much as listen to us , let us calmly consider their demands , and yield to them if , in our deliberate view of our duty , we possibly can . . . . Wrong as we think slavery is , we can yet afford to let it alone where it is , because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual presence in the nation .  | These calming words were believed by the audience because Lincoln had always opposed the abolitionists , defended the Fugitive Slave Law , and put the preservation of the Union ahead of any plans for dealing with slavery . He had made no inflammatory statements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South , had been at the Republican State Convention of Illinois in 1858 , when he quoted A house divided against itself can not stand , and went on to say : Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it , and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction ; or its advocates will push it forward , till it shall become alike lawful in all the States , old as well as new ? North as well as South . Many Southerners interpreted this to mean that Lincoln was in favor of extinguishing slavery by force . All his deeds as well as all his words prove them wrong ; yet the important fact is not that they were wrong but that they distrusted Lincoln . The wisest , most patient , most tolerant man in the North could no longer persuade them of his good faith . But he could persuade the conservatives in his own section , when Seward and Sumner and Chase and the other candidates could not , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward his own cause . Once more his luck had held . In the midst of trouble he alone grew taller . Even Old John Brown had done Lincoln good . When the Republican National Convention met at Chicago in May , 1860 , the feud between Stephen A. Douglas and the Buchanan Administration had already led to a split in the Democratic Party . It seemed clear that there would be several candidates in the field , and the chief Democratic hope was that no one would get a majority in the electoral college . The House of Representatives would then choose the next President , and although the Republicans had a majority in the House they did not control a majority of the state delegations . The Constitution provides that when the election is thrown into the House " the votes shall be taken by states , the representatives from each state having one vote . " 6 So the divided Democrats might still win , and there was an intense feeling at Chicago that nothing should be done which could alienate a single vote . The platform was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform ever devised . " Here was that political maturity , " writes Professor Craven , " which blends ideals and materialism without conscious effort . " 7 It begins by asserting that the Republican Party is permanent .  | The nation needs it , and the party will not dissolve like the evanescent Know-Nothings . The platform then quotes the " unalienable rights " from the Declaration of Independence , and pledges the party to maintain these principles , to defend the Union , to prevent the spread of slavery , to admit Kansas as a free state , and to treat the Dred Scott decision as " a dangerous political heresy . . . revolutionary in its tendency , and subversive of the peace and harmony of the country . " Then the party turned to more practical matters : to luring the old " American Plan " Whigs , the westward expansionists , the rural settlers among the immigrants , the new manufacturers , while losing none of the free-soil enthusiasts and as few as possible of the abolitionists . No gentler words have ever been found for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adjustment of . . . imports , " said the platform , and a " . . . policy of national exchanges , which secures to the workingmen liberal wages , to agriculture remunerative prices , to mechanics and manufacturers an adequate reward for their skill , labor , and enterprise , and to the nation commercial prosperity and independence . " Who would guess that the happy dwellers in this Garden of Eden had ever heard of an iron manufacturer ? ... - , Finally , the platform asks for a homestead act , easy naturalization laws , river and harbor improvements at federal expense , and " immediate and efficient aid " by the federal government in the building of a railway to the Pacific ? in other words , enormous land grants . The South , by ruling itself out of Republican consideration , made possible this masterpiece of concessions and compliments between the Northeast , the Northwest , and the Middle West . Nobody was forgotten , and none of the plums conferred upon one group was likely to irritate another group unduly . Party managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another such platform . It had Hamilton 's appeal to intelligent selfishness and good sense , combined with Jefferson 's optimism and abstract moral excitement . Lincoln was nominated for the presidency on the third ballot , for the reasons we have already seen . He was the only Republican who could win votes in the southern counties of Indiana and Illinois ( where the settlers were mostly of Southern blood and still felt kindly toward their neighbors across the Ohio ) , thus ensuring victory in these two vital states . And he was the only Republican who might hope to win not only the old Jacksonian Democrats in the Northeast ( who were disgusted at the " doughface " Administration ) , but also a number of the old conservative Whigs , especially in rural areas . There was nothing about him to frighten a Pennsylvania manufacturer , or a New England factory hand , or an Indiana farmer whose grandfather came from the South . As for the abolitionists who disapproved of Lincoln 's caution , they had to vote for him anyway , or stay at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | known did him as much good as harm , for the politicians knew that if he had made more fame and friends he must also have made more enemies . They knew that Lincoln was canny , and careful , and unlikely to put a foot wrong in the campaign ; there is no sign that they knew he was wise , long-suffering , and illustrious in spirit. * Neither Eastern conservatives writes Professor Hesseltine , giving lip-service to homesteads and humanitarianism , nor Western radicals with their tongue-in-cheek endorsements of a protective tariff dominated the party . It was a situation in which each faction could claim a share of the victor 's spoils and each could assume a mandate for its principles . Few of those who planned to claim the victory considered that Abraham Lincoln might have a mind of his own.8 When the Democratic Convention met at Charleston on April 23 , the delegates knew that Stephen A. Douglas was their logical candidate and that if they nominated him they would win . They knew that if the Republicans were beaten again in 1860 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalties . And in any case , with another Democratic Administration at Washington , no Southern state except fiery South Carolina would consider secession . So Douglas meant the salvation of the Union . Yet the stubborn , vindictive Buchanan Administration used all its strength against him ? not for the sake of the President , who had said he did not want a second term , but in order to " punish " Douglas for opposing the Lecompton Constitution and for asserting that the Dred Scott decision did not make slavery safe in a territory if the inhabitants refused to support it with police power . The fire-eaters and the " doughface " leaders did not choose to notice that in punishing Douglas they were punishing if not destroying the party and the nation . Buchanan and his advisers had at last been trapped by the extreme Southerners , who were glad to break the Democratic Party as a step toward breaking the Union , and who felt they had been duped by Douglas into accepting popular sovereignty and then duped again when Douglas insisted that the sovereign people had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " doughfaces , " Northern Democrats were as strong for rewarding Douglas as the Southerners were for punishing him .

"  | thought in terms of an election , not of a revolution , and they felt it would he agreeable to win . They were a majority in the convention and they rejected the Southern demand for federal protection of slavery in every territory . Such a platform , they knew , meant handing the whole North to the Republicans . The spokesman for the South was William Lowndes Yancey of Alabama .

" he cried , " you would have triumphed , and anti-slavery would now be dead in your midst . " Thus Yancey justified Lincoln 's remark in the Cooper Institute speech that every argument must in the end come back to the ethics of slavery : " Their thinking it right , and our thinking it wrong , is the precise fact upon which depends the whole controversy . Thinking it right , as they do , they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition , as being right ; but thinking it wrong , as we do , can we yield to them ? Can we cast our votes with their view , and against our own ? In view of our moral , social , and political responsibilities can we do this ? " At the Charleston Convention , Senator Pugh of Ohio gave Yancey the answer that Lincoln would have given . " Gentlemen of the South , " he said , " you mistake us ? you mistake us ? we will not do it . " And the majority did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the protection of slavery in the territories , whereupon Yancey and the cotton-state delegates walked out . A few days later the convention adjourned with nothing done . " The great Democratic Party , one of the last truly national institutions in a dividing nation , had split . A sectional party for the South , comparable to the Republican Party at the North , was now possible . " ' " We are for principles , " said a Mississippi delegate to a conciliatory Northerner ; " damn the party . " What he meant was , " damn the federal Union . " The convention adjourned to Baltimore , where on June 23 , the Northern delegates made Douglas the official nominee of the Democratic Party with a platform promising that the party would stand by the Dred Scott decision or any future Supreme Court decision concerning the rights of property in the states and territories. * This was the typical noncommittal evasive plank upon which party promises must rest .

Johnson of Georgia .  | Meanwhile , on May 8 , a last sad remnant of conservative Whigs and of Know-Nothings met at Baltimore and took the name of the Constitutional Union Party ? the short-lived Georgian Party which had been founded by Stephens , Toombs , and Cobb in support of the great Compromise . The new Constitutional Unionists nominated John Bell of Tennessee for President and Edward Everett of Massachusetts for VicePresident . They stood on the vague platform : " The Constitution of the Country , the Union of the states , and the enforcement of the laws .

And the old order upheld by a few old and dying Whigs . Stephen A. Douglas might be insensitive , but he was everlastingly brave . Against the custom of the day he campaigned actively , especially in the South , where he met every challenge boldly . He told the Southerners that if he were President he would put down secession by force , and he begged them to remember that the whole Northwest felt the same . In North Carolina he put the case bluntly : " Do you think that a citizen of Illinois will ever consent to pay duties at the custom house when he ships his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never on Earth ! We shall say to the custom house gate keeper that we furnish the water that makes the great river , and that we will follow it throughout its whole course to the ocean , no matter who or what may stand before us. " 10 His hearers may have remembered Henry Clay 's somber warning , during the great debates of 1850 , that the upper Mississippi Valley could never allow the lower valley to pass to foreign hands . Yet Douglas received a light vote in the South . He was respected for his courage ; but the real contest was between Breckinridge and Bell : between the fire-eaters and the conservatives who still believed in Union . These long-time foes did not stop to notice that while fighting each other ( and distributing the Democratic vote among three men ) they were helping Lincoln . " Not until the last few weeks of the campaign , " writes  | Professor Craven , " did it dawn upon them that , regardless of which group triumphed in the South , the Republican Party would triumph in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division in the interests of Lincoln 's election and the opportunity to secure secession thereby . " 11 Last-minute efforts to agree on one of the candidates ? so that the South and the Northern conservatives might again defeat the Republicans ? were a failure . The South walked stubbornly to her doom , lulled by boasts about the need of France and England for her cotton and the willingness of these Powers to bid for a Southern alliance. * Lincoln took small part in the campaign . Even when rallies were held in his home town of Springfield , he usually did not attend . The Republican Party workers went back to the methods of the Harrison-Tyler campaign of 1840 . They relied on bands and songs and torchlight parades by the young " Wide-Awakes , " rather than discussions which might bring out the divisions within the party . For the party had as yet no true national organization , and no true national identity . Even more than is usual , the election depended on state campaigns . No political party had ever before been so largely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory in November could not be attributed to the national committee : it was weak , impoverished , and ineffective . Nor could it be credited to Abraham Lincoln : he was acceptable , but inarticulate ? bound by tradition to hide his political skill and bide his days in almost monastic seclusion . . .. In the end the governors won their state campaigns , and their combined successes put Abraham Lincoln in the White House.12 Ironically , it seems that while the South ignored the coming Republican victory , Lincoln himself ignored the danger of secession . A politician from Ohio who visited Lincoln shortly after the election was disturbed by this seeming blindness . I soon discovered he wrote that this strange and strangely gifted man , while not at all cynical , was a skeptic . His view of human nature was low , but good-natured .

" 13 The map of the voting in 1860 is a portrait of a nation breaking in two . The whole tier of Northern states ( including Oregon and California ) voted for Lincoln ; the whole tier of cotton states voted for Breckinridge ; Douglas had the southern counties of the Middlewestern states and a few spots in the Far North and the Far South ; Bell had the planters along the Mississippi , the tobacco-growers of Kentucky and Tennessee , the mountaineers in western Virginia and North Carolina , and the state of Maryland ? all the Southerners who still preferred the Union . Lincoln had over 1,800,000 votes ; Douglas almost 1,400,000 ; Breckinridge more than 800,000 ; and Bell a little less than 600,000 . The three anti-Republican candidates combined received a million more votes than Lincoln , yet Lincoln would still have been elected if all those votes had gone to one man ! Lincoln received 180 electoral votes ; Douglas , 12 ; Breckinridge , 72 ; and Bell , 39 . This is a sign of the electoral-college strength of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majorities , while his opponents received all the Southern votes . In ten Southern states not a single man voted for Lincoln. * In his speech at the Cooper Institute early in 1860 , Lincoln had said to the South : There is a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation , which cast at least a million and a half votes . You can not destroy that judgment and feeling ? that sentiment ? by breaking up the political organization which rallies around it . You can scarcely scatter and disperse an army which has been formed into order in the face of your heaviest fire ; but if you could , how much would you gain by forcing the sentiment which created it out of the peaceful channel of the ballotbox , into some other channel ? The answer must have seemed obvious to Lincoln , which may be why he could not believe in secession . But Lincoln , as his friend from Ohio said , " while not at all cynical , was a skeptic .

Lincoln could have told them , before they seceded , that life was not so gay and unaccountable , that war was a dreary , deadly balancing of accounts , and that the balance was against the South . It was against her physically , because she had kept her capital in slaves and cotton and so did not have the industrial plant or the railways for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had abandoned the Jeffersonian view that slavery was an evil which must be brought to the earliest possible end , and had embraced the heresy that slavery was a good which must be everywhere protected . The moral weakness would discourage France and England from intervening to save the Confederacy and balk the power of the United States . The physical weakness would prevent the South 's impetuous valor from triumphing over valor that was more calculating . There was of course a chance that the North might defeat herself , if Lincoln failed to heal the deep divisions in his party , or if he behaved carefully and constitutionally when faced with a mortal threat . But if he could bring unity to his strange alliance of protectionists , abolitionists , homesteaders , railroad barons , and simple folk who knew that the Union was the guardian of democracy , and if he could seize power boldly and illegally in order to save a government which denied itself such power , then no amount of Southern suffering or bravery or military brains would suffice . Lincoln could save the Confederacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been lost long before , when the decisions were taken which made the factories in the South so few , and slavery a growing rather than a waning system. * footnote *In 1860 the South turned out about eight per cent of the manufactured produce of the United States .  | The months between the election in November and Lincoln 's inauguration in March were a time of fear and anticlimax . Decisions had been made , yet the results were in abeyance while Buchanan lingered in the White House , fumbling and inconclusive . His temperament and his political opinions would not let him accept secession , or prevent it , or prepare to meet it after it had taken place . General Scott warned him in October that the election would be followed by an attempt to destroy the Union , and that he should strengthen the garrisons in Southern ports . Buchanan did nothing and in his paradoxical message to Congress on December 1 , he continued to do nothing , denying the right of secession and denying that the government could do anything about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the laws so that the nation might save its life . But Congress preferred to leave the thorny trouble to the Executive . Since the last great federal compromise had been sacrificed by two soft Presidents , even Henry Clay might have had trouble in inventing a new one . " The Buchanan administration , " writes Professor Swisher , " expired while engaged in futile speculation as to its own powers . " It very nearly expired before its time , for members of the Cabinet began resigning within a few weeks of the election . Howell Cobb ? for so long the faithful Unionist ? went on December 2 because the President had denied the right of secession . The Secretary of State , Lewis Cass , resigned on December 12 because the President did not reinforce the forts in Charleston Harbor . Floyd of Virginia , the incompetent Secretary of War , resigned on December 29 , ostensibly because his delicate spirit could no longer bear association with a dishonored regime , but really because he was about to be charged with fraud and treason ? neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he permitted . Professor Nichols 's description of the Secretary three days before his resignation suggests the murky atmosphere of the time : When Floyd presented himself at the White House . . . he had just been exposed as a careless , if not dishonest , administrator who was about to be indicted by the District grand jury for conspiracy to defraud and for malfeasance in office . He was to be accused of treason because of his  | foolhardy gesture in trying to ship heavy guns into the South . The night before , Senator Wigfall and others had urged him to join a plot to kidnap Buchanan and make Breckenridge President ; this he had refused to do . Also he had become suspicious of a large order for converted muskets which he had approved ostensibly for the Sardinian government ; that order he would countermand . ' These were no days for the decrepit , like Cass , or the trivial , like Floyd and Buchanan . And Washington was no longer the place for Southern patriots like Cobb . A new cast was about to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their proud masters were done , On December 20 , 1860 , a convention in South Carolina voted to secede . Within six weeks Mississippi , Florida , Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana , and Texas had followed . In all these states , with the possible exception of South Carolina , there was a strong Unionist minority ? perhaps in some rases even a majority . This group urged that Lincoln 's Administration be given a fair trial , asking what would be gained by breaking the Union until the North proved that it meant to attack and oppress the South . But there were many secessionists who had long felt the Union a burden ? an economic threat as well as a moral reproach ? and this time they did not mean to be balked . With stormy talk of " Black Republicans , " of slave insurrections , and with many reminders of the insults abolitionists had thrown against the South , they stirred the people until Alexander Stephens admitted that " they are run mad . " " They are wild with passion and frenzy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. " The pity was that to the minds of many middle-of-the-road Southerners the fire-eaters now seemed justified . In 1860 the country was back again to the arguments of 1850 , or of the Wilmot Proviso ; but during the intervening years the great Compromise had been tried and had failed . The extremists who had said it must fail were therefore strengthened . In 1850 they had been silenced by the moderates ; in 1860 , at least in the cotton South , they were in control . Men like Cobb and Stephens and Toombs could no longer restrain them . These brave defenders of the Union were captured by the forces they had long fought , but which their local patriotism now bade them serve . On February 3 , 1861 , delegates from the seven seceded states met at Montgomery , Alabama . Five days later they formed the Confederate States of America , electing Jefferson Davis provisional President and Alexander Stephens Vice-President . Toombs , as we have footnote * Professor J. G. Randall believes a minority forced secession upon the South .  | seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Confederacy. * The arguments put forward by the seven state conventions to justify secession were arguments in defense of slavery and in denunciation of the North for acts inimical to the institution : " enticing " slaves , ignoring the Fugitive Slave Law , excluding slavery from the territories , plotting slave insurrections . South Carolina complained , candidly and simply , that the North had " denounced as sinful the institution of slavery . . . and united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery . " The long and bitter wrangle , in other words , had so frayed the nerves of the South Carolinians that they would no longer associate with men who thought slavery wrong . None of the conventions mentioned economic oppression as a cause for disunion . There was doubtless fear of such oppression , now that a Northern sectional party was about to take power ; yet the South still had a tariff after her own heart , and she rnight long have continued to frustrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union . There was of course no question in the minds of Southern leaders about the " right " to secede . That " right , " first proclaimed by John Taylor of Caroline County , later developed by the Federalists of New England , later still perfected in all its legal subtleties by John Caldwell Calhoun , had been accepted both as truth and as treason by each section of the country in turn , depending on whether its interests were temporarily served by affirming or by denying the sovereignty of the central government . History can not compose the quarrel ; but it can note that the binding test of sovereignty is power . If Buchanan had been President after 1861 , the " right " to secede would doubtless have been established . Since Lincoln was President , and since enough people followed his lead in fighting for the Union , the " right " proved nonexistent . The question was too intricate for the lawyers ; only soldiers could decide . Meanwhile , federal property in the South was seized , with no finger lifted in defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December . Georgia took Fort Pulaski at Savannah on January 3 , and Alabama took Fort Morgan at Mobile on January 4 . At Pensacola , in Florida , the Union held Fort Pickens ; but the federal navy yard and Fort Barrancas were seized by Southern troops . Louisiana confiscated the mint footnote * Davis was inaugurated as provisional President on February 18 .

He was then inaugurated ( or re-inaugurated ) on February 22 , 1862.  | at New Orleans , and throughout the cotton states federal cutters , federal post offices and custom houses , were passing into rebel hands ? thus creating the problem of Fort Sumter for Lincoln . By the time of the inauguration , Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor was the most important post still held by the Union in the Deep South . Buchanan had agreed not to reinforce Fort Pickens at Pensacola so long as it was not attacked ; but in a nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ahd failed , because the Union ship , the Star of the West , had been fired on by the South Carolina batteries . SO the nation , North and South , could not help but judge the intentions of the new Administration by what was done about Sumter . Although Lincoln had said little during the campaign or after , anyone n touch with him must have known what he would recommend . But the decision to use or to abandon force was not truly his ; it lay with the people of the North . No president could compel them to war with their fellow Americans , although a bolder , kinder man than Buchanan might have helped them face the tragic choice more rapidly . Leaderless , they groped for months through the mist , while Lincoln watched impotently , waiting to do what proved possible . At first the Republican radicals ( who cared nothing for economic or patriotic ties with the South ) were confident the new Administration would be a Free-Soil , Barnburning , Old Jacksonian , secession-defying triumph . They formed a committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests , led by Pennsylvania and by Thurlow Weed of New York , thought the Republicans were merely the appeasing Whigs revived . On the eve of the election Andrew Gregg Curtin , the new Republican governor of Pennsylvania , spoke in Boston without mentioning slavery . For him the tariff was the issue , and he told his audience that to be good Republicans they must vote for men with sound Whig records . Victory at the polls merely made sharper the conflict between the Republicans who would abolish slavery and the Republicans who would ignore it . Neither group gave heed to Lincoln 's cautious and increasingly popular view that the task was to keep slavery from spreading and to save the Union ; but both sent leaders to Springfield to tell the President-elect what he should think and do . Lincoln listened and said nothing . In December the last-ditch compromisers tried to force the issue . Thurlow Weed called a meeting of the state governors to form a conciliatory policy and to impress it on the Congress and on Lincoln . And in the Senate Crittenden of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clay . He proposed several amendments to the Constitution ; for example , a restored but weakened Missouri Compromise , whereby latitude 36 ? 30 ' should divide freedom from slavery in all the territories , and whereby a territory on assuming statehood might decide for itself on  | slavery ; and a guarantee of slavery where it already existed for so long as the people of each state might desire it . Lincoln roused himself to send word to the governors and the Congress that he disapproved of extending the Missouri line for the territories and that he would reject any form of squatter sovereignty which might permit another slave state . " On that point hold firm , " he said , " as with a chain of steel . " * For the rest , he would commit himself to nothing except Jackson 's old toast : " Our Federal Union , it must be preserved . " The wisdom of Lincoln 's caution , of his refusal to push the people faster than they had yet prepared themselves to go , was shown by the situation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South and in New England textile industries . New Yorkers were also annoyed with the government at Albany for interfering in their local administration and for raising too much of the state 's revenue at the expense of their flourishing town . So in a message to the common council on January 7 , 1861 , the Democratic mayor of New York , Fernando Wood , calmly recommended that in case of Southern secession New York City should also leave the Union , setting itself up as a free port and a taxless Paradise . With our aggrieved brethren of the slave states he said we have friendly relations and a common sympathy . We have not participated in the warfare upon their constitutional rights or their domestic institutions . . . . New York has a right to expect , and should endeavour to preserve , a continuance of uninterrupted intercourse with every section . . . . Why should not New York City , instead of supporting by her contributions two-thirds of the expenses of the United States , become also equally independent ? As a free city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be supported without taxation upon her people . . . . When Disunion has become a fixed and certain fact , why may not New York disrupt the bands which bind her to a venal and corrupt master ? to a people and a party that have plundered her revenues , attempted to ruin her commerce , taken away the power of self-government , and destroyed the Confederacy of which she was the proud Empire City ? Mayor Wood admitted that he did not see precisely how this was to be done ; but the fact that a vote-loving politician thought the message worth delivering is a sign of the magnitude of Lincoln 's task . While waiting for the months to pass , helpless to intervene , Lincoln began to build his Cabinet and thus to bind some factions of the restive party to his own will , and to his support when a decision might at last be made . He had early decided to offer the secretaryship of state to footnote * The words quoted were said on December 13 , five days before the Crittenden Resolutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on every compromise  | Seward , and he was half-bound by the promises of his managers at the nominating convention to make the conservative Caleb Smith of Indiana Secretary of the Interior , and the angry unscrupulous Senator Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania Secretary of War . He allowed the Vice-President-elect ( Hannibal Hamlin of Maine ) to choose a New Englander for Secretary of the Navy . Hamlin named Gideon Welles of Connecticut , famous for his enormous beard . Welles was a Democrat who broke with his party over slavery . He knew nothing of the sea , and has been described as " venerably insignificant . " Yet he proved a good administrator and a vindictive diarist . The old-fashioned Whigs were awarded Edward Bates of Missouri as Attorney General , and the Jacksonian converts were given Montgomery Blair of Maryland , son of Francis Preston Blair of the " Kitchen Cabinet , " as Postmaster General . The Free-Soilers won Salmon P. Chase of Ohio as Secretary of the Treasury . The manysidedness and incongruity of the new party was mirrored in this group . The members did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them did not respect Lincoln . Each of them had bitter enemies among rival factions within his own state ? which proved a help to Lincoln , for it enforced a semblance of loyalty , at least while the patronage was being distributed . These were the first federal plums ever awarded by a Republican President , and Lincoln strained to use them to build the nucleus of a national party . Boldly , he ordered that all applicants must be endorsed by their Congressmen ? not by their governors or local leaders ? thus helping the infant federal machine at the expense of the states . The appointment of the tough unprincipled Cameron ( which Lincoln regretted but could not evade ) brought no peace to Pennsylvania . Cameron and the new governor Curtin had detested each other for years . Neither could control the state alone , yet either one might spoil the party 's chances at the next election .

On February 11 , when Lincoln set out on his long , roundabout trip to Washington , it was already probable that if he stood firm the citizens would back him in saving the Union . Yet he was still unwilling to declare a policy . " My friends . . . " he said to his neighbors from the rear platform of the train at Springfield , " to this place , and the kindness of these people , I owe everything .... I now leave , not knowing when or whether ever I may return , with a task before me greater than that which rested upon Washington . Without the assistance of that Divine Being who ever attended him , I can not succeed . With that assistance , I can not fail . . . . " That was a charming good-bye ; but it did not answer the anxious politicians who were waiting to hear what Lincoln intended . And on the trip ? although he spoke at more than a dozen cities , and to the legislatures of Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indiana ? he was no more informative . At his first stop , at Indianapolis , he told the people , " It is your business to rise up and preserve the Union and liberty for yourselves , and not for me . " At every stop he said the same , in one form or another . He was seeking to learn from the people , not yet to guide them ; but he seems to have been reassured by what he found . Ten days before the inauguration he met at Washington with the socalled Peace Conference ? delegates from twenty-one states who had gathered in a last hope to restore unity without resort to force . The Vermont delegate reports that William Dodge of New York told Lincoln , " It is for you , sir , to say whether the whole nation shall be plunged into bankruptcy ; whether the grass shall grow in the streets of our commercial cities . " The report continues : A sad but stern expression swept over Mr. Lincoln 's face . " I do not know that I understand your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising his voice , " nor do I know what my acts or my opinions may be in the future , beyond this. - If I shall ever come to the great office of President of the United States , I shall take an oath .

It is not the Constitution as I would like to have it , but as it is , that is to be defended . The Constitution will not be preserved and defended unless it is enforced and obeyed in every part of every one of the United States . It must be so respected , obeyed , enforced , and defended , let the grass grow where it may . "  | The Washington in which Lincoln was inaugurated on March 4 was slightly improved over the distressing sea of mud to which poor John Adams had been forced to move in 1800 ; but it was still a wretched place . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio Congressman wrote that it was as unattractive , straggling , sodden a town , wandering up and down the left bank of the yellow Potomac , as the fancy can sketch . Pennsylvania Avenue . . . stretched drearily over the mile between the unfinished Capitol and the unfinished Treasury building on Fifteenth Street . . . where it turned north for a square and took its melancholy way to Georgetown . . . . It was the only paved street in the town ... . As may be supposed the Capital of the Republic had more malodors than the poet Coleridge ascribed to ancient Cologne . There was then the open canal , a branch of the Chesapeake and Ohio , from Rock Creek to Anacosta , breeding malaria , tadpoles , and mosquitoes ... . Politically , the city ? the fixed population ? was intensely Southern , as much so as Richmond or Baltimore . Very few men of culture , and none below that grade , were Republicans at the advent of " Lincoln and his Northern myrmidons , " as they were called in 1860-1861.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the union is perpetual , " since it is older than the Constitution , older than the states , older even than the Declaration of Independence . " It was formed , " he claimed , " by the Articles of Association in 1774 . " This is dubious history , and in any case unimportant , since the problem of the permanence of the Union would be settled by the strength and the will of the North , not by research . Yet Lincoln 's exegesis is interesting , for it is a tribute to the deep need of English-speaking peoples to feel that the law is on their side . The fathers of the Republic claimed they were defending the true British Constitution in their revolt ; and when Parliament denied this , they appealed to natural law against a seemingly unnatural king . Similarly , both Jefferson Davis and Lincoln , taught respectively by Calhoun and John Marshall , were convinced that in making war upon one another they were backed by the Constitution of the United States and the obvious facts of history. * The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the states where it existed , and argued against the " right " of footnote * Davis , in truth , seems to have had the best of the barren argument in his message to the Confederate Congress of April 29 , 1861.  | secession . Toward the end of the address he rose to the serene simplicity which he alone could attain . Physically speaking , we can not separate . We can not remove our respective sections from each other , nor build an impassable wall between them . A husband and wife may be divorced , and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other ; but the different parts of our country can not do this . They can not but remain face to face , and intercourse , either amicable or hostile , must continue between them . Is it possible , then , to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before ? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws ? .. . This country , with its institutions , belongs to the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existing government , they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it , or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it . . . . Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people ? Is there any better or equal hope in the world ? Jefferson Davis would have answered that he and his people were merely seeking to exercise " their revolutionary right to dismember " the United States . Lincoln must have denied that right to a sectional majority , although he affirmed it for a national majority . The Inaugural Address then asks for patience from the South , on the characteristically American ground that the government did not have sufficient power to do much harm : By the frame of government under which we live , this same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief ; and have , with equal wisdom , provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals . While the people retain their virtue and vigilance , no administration , by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government in the short space of four years . The South would have answered that Lincoln 's constituents had lost " their virtue and vigilance , " and that nothing could now restrain the government from doing what it chose . Ironically , although the Southerners were wrong about the people of the North , they were right about the government , as Lincoln was about to prove . All the shoots of presidential power , large or small , which had been planted and nurtured by his predecessors , Lincoln was to bring to full growth . When he died the presidency was supreme above the states . " A new nation , " writes Professor Hesseltine , " had been erected on the ruins of the old federal union . " 4 So far did the change go that the people became uneasy , and the party system was called upon after the war to undo some of the centralization , and to  | rebuild some of the obstructive strength of sectional minorities ? until a new crisis caused another President to revive the immense powers uncovered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden of choice upon the Southerners . " In your hands , my dissatisfied fellow countrymen , and not in mine , is the momentous issue of civil war . The government will not assail you . You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors . You have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government , while I shall have the most solemn one to preserve , protect , and defend ' it . " In the course of preserving , protecting , and defending the Union , Lincoln decided that he must defend Fort Sumter . He has been accused of taking the offensive by this act ; but it seems that he was trying to preserve the status quo as nearly as possible . ' The purpose of the relief expedition under Captain Fox was to supply food to the garrison . Reinforcements were not to be landed unless the ships or the fort were attacked . There was no attempt at surprise . Notice of the expedition and a promise of its pacific purpose were sent to the governor of South Carolina . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understood in the southern states and under these circumstances the decision to relieve Sumter was one of the most far-reaching and fateful acts in American history . " ** At four-thirty on the morning of April 12 , 1861 , by authority of Brigadier General Beauregard of the Confederate Army , the batteries in Charleston Harbor opened fire on Fort Sumter . On April 14 Major Anderson of the Union Army surrendered the fort . The next day Lincoln issued a proclamation calling out 75,000 militia to suppress the rebellion , the North responding with an enthusiasm which showed he could have had many times the number . Stephen A. Douglas made a strong statement in support of the President , and shortly afterward offered to tour Illinois , where the southern counties were still disaffected , and sound the call of the Union . Lincoln accepted gratefully , and Douglas set out on his last footnote * The question of how much power a government needs and how that power can be reconciled with freedom ? and the allied question , also posed in the Inaugural Address , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? bothered Lincoln steadily . In his message to the special session of Congress on July 4 , 1861 , he said that the war " presents the question whether discontented individuals , too few in number to control the administration according to organic laws in any case , can always , upon the pretences made in this case , or any other pretences . . . break up their government . . . . It forces us to ask : Is there in all republics this inherent and fatal weakness ? Must a government , of necessity , be too strong for the liberties of its own people , or too weak to maintain its own existence ? " ** It was made by Lincoln himself , against the advice of his Secretary of State who wished to hold Fort Pickens but to surrender Sumter . But the Secretary of State , as we shall see , was at this time in a whirl of crazy plans , including the interesting notion of bringing the South back to the Union by declaring war on France , Spain , and possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ en route and on April 25 at Springfield , Illinois , he made a speech which has been called his greatest . A few days later he broke down . He was said to have rheumatism , and developed a high fever , and on June 3 he died . He was forty-eight years old . He left the Democratic Party without a national leader , and with only fourteen members in the Senate ( including Andrew Johnson of eastern Tennessee who refused to secede with his state ) and forty-four in the House . Two days after Lincoln 's call for troops , Virginia seceded , followed quickly by North Carolina , Arkansas , and Tennessee . Delaware and Maryland , Kentucky and Missouri , were split into bitter factions at home ; but none of these border states officially left the Union . If Kentucky had gone , the war might have been lost before it started , for the frontier would then have been the broad and turbulent Ohio all the way from Cincinnati to the Mississippi River . Even as it was , with Virginia and Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On May 15 , 1861 , a Virginian who had tried to help avoid the war wrote to a friend : " My maxim has always been to choose among the evils around me and do the best I can . I think the annals of the world furnish no instance of so groundless a war ? but as our nation will have it ? if no peace can be made ? let us fight like men for our own firesides . " ' So groundless a war ? Perhaps wiser guidance during the ten previous years might have made it groundless indeed ; perhaps the Compromise of 1850 might have been enforced ; but by the time Lincoln became President the leaders of the Deep South were set to leave the Union . He had no choice but to let them go in peace , to attack them as traitors , or to attempt a policy of evasion and delay which might allow the conservatives to regain control and reverse the decision to secede . The latter seems to have been Lincoln 's purpose ; but if he abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage rebellion . And if he held the forts he would give the Southern extremists a chance to provoke war . He decided to hold the forts , and his intentions were misconstrued , and the war began . As all the world knows , the President to whom this calamity came had been born and raised in the utmost poverty . We have seen that his Kentucky birthplace was a few miles from that of Jefferson Davis , whose more prosperous family went south to Mississippi while the Lincolns , who were destitute , moved across the Ohio River into Indiana . Lincoln 's father ( whose people had come to Massachusetts from Norfolk in 1637 ) was a  | typical shiftless frontier failure . He left Kentucky in 1816 , when the boy was seven . And he left Indiana for Illinois in the year Lincoln came of age . He was not the man to urge a child toward self-improvement . " I suppose Abe is still fooling hisself with eddication , " he said years later when Abe had left home to make his own way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got that fool idea in his head , and it ca n't be got out . " Perhaps the " fool idea " came from his mother , Nancy Hanks , the illegitimate daughter of a Virginian . Little is known about Nancy ( not even the name of her father ) except that she was illiterate , that she had two children ( Abraham and Sarah ) and that she died in 1818 when the boy was nine years old . The father soon married again , and his second wife seems to have been in every way his better . Lincoln was fond of his stepmother , who backed him in his strange addiction to books . Although he had less than twelve months of schooling , his little , typical frontier library was a good basis for straight thinking and a clear prose style : The Bible , Pilgrim 's Progress , Robinson Crusoe , Aesop 's Fables , and Parson Weems 's Life of Washington . The hard work of farming ? and of clearing fresh land , fencing it , building new cabins ? turned Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height and with a strength that became legendary even in the rough West . But he never lost his desire to learn . He would walk miles to borrow a book ? and what was far more unusual , having borrowed it , and read it , he would actually think about it . He was one of the very few people who could go on thinking after he had stopped reading or talking . He never learned to turn his back , except briefly , on the great defeating questions of life and death and destiny . This may be why he was unhappy , and why he was great . He was oppressed by the mystery but never frightened ; so in his long days alone ? as a boy on the frontier or on a river-boat , as a man driving his buggy across the empty prairies from one county courthouse to another ? he did not close or distract his mind or his spirit . He continued his rapt , sometimes morbid , search for understanding ? and one day ( although he never knew it ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer described Lincoln in court when he was lost in thinking : " He seemed to be pursuing in his mind some specific painful subject , regularly and systematically through various sinuosities ; and his sad face would assume , at times , deeper phases of grief . No relief came till he was roused by the adjournment of court , when he emerged from his cage of gloom , like one awakened from sleep . " During such hours of abstraction , which came upon him from the time he was a child , Lincoln was not pursuing a mystic trance : he was trying to think . This is perhaps the most difficult of undertakings , and the rarest . Lincoln 's addiction to it may explain why all his life he grew in mercy and in understanding . At forty he was a leading Western lawyer  | and an unsuccessful Congressman ; at fifty he was not only a national figure , but in his own section he was an important moral force ; at fiftysix , when he was murdered , he was one of the masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia by men who knew nothing about him , or about America , except that someone good had gone from the earth . The accidents of politics may make a man world-famous ; but only richness of spirit can make him world-respected . In Lincoln the richness came from thought , from his painful prolonged brooding , " wrapped in abstraction and gloom . " He had no clear religious faith . He believed in God , but seemingly in an unconsoling God . He said it was his destiny to live in twilight , feeling and reasoning his way through life . He said he was like the man in St. Mark : " Lord , I believe ; help Thou mine unbelief . " If Lincoln 's " feeling and reasoning " made him wise , pious , and subtle , it also made him irreverent , bawdy , impudent , ribald , and cruelly funny . He was the best storyteller in the West and the best mimic . He found it seductively easy to make an opponent look absurd ; but he seldom used this power in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his political foes . His broad and racy laughter was probably his salvation . " Lincoln 's humour , " wrote Francis Grierson , " was the balance-pole of his genius that enabled him to cross the most giddy heights without losing his head . " * Flatboatman on the long trip to New Orleans ; clerk in a country store , and later joint owner of a store that failed and left him burdened ; captain of a local band in the Black Hawk Indian War ; unsuccessful Whig candidate for the state legislature , and then successful candidate for four terms on end ? Lincoln tried all these jobs . In 1836 , in the middle of his term in the state legislature , he began the practice of law . Here was work suited to his tastes and talents . He rose to the front rank in the Illinois bar ? yet his true love was politics . Although surrounded by fierce Jacksonian Democrats , Lincoln remained a Whig ? perhaps because his political passions were first fired by Henry Clay , or perhaps because of his cautious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could honor the leveling doctrines of the Declaration of Independence and still be a conservative ; an enemy of all sudden or extreme change . This was becoming difficult , if not impossible , among the Eastern banks and factories . The Republican Party might have been riven to its foundations if Lincoln had lived to fight for his Western brand of conservatism after the war . In 1859 , for example , when he was unable to speak at a festival in Boston , he sent a letter in which he put his egalitarian faith briefly : " The principles of Jefferson are the definitions and axioms of a free society . footnote * The Valley of Shadows , 1948 ed. , p. 196 . Grierson 's long-ignored classic , consisting of " recollections of scenes and episodes of my early life in Illinois and Missouri , " was published in 1909 . It gives far the best picture of the Western men to whom Lincoln first became a hero . p 416 And yet they are denied and evaded with no small show of success . One dashingly calls them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ; and still others insidiously argue that they apply only to superior races . ' . . . We must repulse them , or they will subjugate us . " This was carrying the fight home to his friends , for the man who had called the Declaration of Independence " glittering generalities " was Rufus Choate , the famous Whig lawyer of Boston . In 1842 Lincoln married Mary Todd of Kentucky . Much dubious legend surrounds the marriage . It is true that Mrs. Lincoln 's temperament was difficult ; and so was her husband 's ; but there is small ground for believing that life in the Lincoln home was as unhappy or as odd as it has been pictured . There were four sons , only one of whom grew to maturity . Between 1847 and 1849 Lincoln served a term in Congress , where he was the only Whig from Illinois . A loyal party worker , he opposed the Mexican War . On January 12 , 1848 , he made an anti-war speech which could well have been revived by any Southerner to justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " being inclined and having the power , have the right to rise up and shake off the existing government , and form a new one that suits them better . This is a most valuable , a most sacred right . . . . Nor is this right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing government may choose to exercise it . Any portion of such people that can , may revolutionize . " This is strong doctrine , though natural for a child of 1776 . It seems that the young Lincoln , like Jefferson and Jackson and most Americans , approved resistance to the state when the state was " wrong " ? that is , when it was opposed to his views . Or perhaps he was simply toeing the Whig Party line . In any case , his opposition to the Mexican War was so unpopular at home that he was accused of pleading the enemy 's cause and denied re-election . He returned to his successful law practice at Springfield , and for five years was inactive in politics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and puzzling the entangled problems of slavery and Union . There was nothing impractical or softly emotional about Lincoln 's distaste for slavery . He was not so foolish as to think that because a course was good it was therefore possible . He was never moved to ignore or deny the dangers in the path of emancipation ? so he was not an abolitionist , and in no hurry to free any of the existing slaves . For this he was abused and called heartless ; but in fact he was one of the few Northerners to think honestly about the plight of the Negro . He knew that a huge effort and a huge sum of money were needed if the Negro was to be freed without imposing upon him another miserable lot . The black man had been the victim of greed , and Lincoln did not choose to cure that wrong by making him the victim of sentimentality . Hence his statement in 1854 : " When southern people tell us they are  | no more responsible for the origin of slavery than we are , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution exists , and that it is very difficult to get rid of it in any satisfactory way , I can understand and appreciate the saying . I surely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to do myself . " While in Congress he introduced an unsuccessful bill for gradual emancipation in the District of Columbia ? the only slave territory which the federal government controlled . Children born of slave mothers after 1850 were to be free , although during their minority they were to be apprenticed to their mothers ' owners . And owners who might wish to emancipate their slaves were to receive " full value " from the United States Treasury . The act was to be submitted to the free white citizens of the District in a referendum . As Professor Randall says , this was typical of Lincoln 's " conservatism , his patience in letting a process work itself out over the years , his lack of antagonism toward the South , his regard for the rights of slaveholders , his attention to legal details , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But for all his caution and his patience , there was one step Lincoln could never permit : the infection of new lands with the curse which was so hard to cure . On this he was confident and unrelenting . The more clearly he saw the problems of emancipation , the more bluntly he must oppose the planting of such problems on the territories . " We must give them a clean bed , " he said , " with no snakes in it . " On one other point Lincoln was positive : whatever he might have said or written about man 's " right " to revolution , he knew that no such right existed unless it could be enforced . The only sanction of a revolution , as of a legitimate government , is power . And Lincoln had slowly , painfully , made up his mind that the North ought to use power , if necessary , to save the Union . In this he was a true son of the West ? like Henry Clay , like Stephen A. Douglas , like Vinton of Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolina might , for all I know , find a dividing line that would be mutually satisfactory to them , but , sir , they can find no such line to which the western country can assent . " This was not only because the West refused to give the mouth of its great river into foreign hands ; but also because the whole vast region was the Valley of Democracy , almost the only place on earth where the new creed was lived as well as talked . If the Union fell , democracy might be discredited , and for the West that was a deplorable thought . When the Missouri Compromise was repealed , therefore , and the resulting uproar led to new demands for secession , every political belief on which Lincoln had built his life was challenged . When he returned to politics after his five years in the wilderness he became the perfect spokesman of his region . When he joined the new party in 1856 he gave it strength and sanity . In his hands it would never be weakened by radical-  | ism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of preventing slavery in the territories . We have seen how he pinned Douglas to this issue , forcing him to discuss it in lieu of all else during the famous debates of 1858 . Grierson gives us a first-hand picture of Lincoln in the last of these de-bates : And now Abraham Lincoln , the man who in 1830 undertook to split for Mrs. Nancy Miller four hundred rails for every yard of brown jean dyed with walnut bark that would be required to make him a pair of trousers , the flatboatman , local stump-speaker and country lawyer , rose from his seat , stretched his long bony limbs upward as if to get them into working order , and stood like some solitary pine on a lonely summit , very tall , very dark , very gaunt , and very rugged , his swarthy features stamped with a sad serenity . . . . Every movement of his long , muscular frame denoted inflexible earnestness , and a something issued forth , elemental and mystical , that told what the man had been , what he was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Douglas had been theatrical and scholarly , but this tall , homely man was creating by his very looks what the brilliant lawyer and experienced Senator had failed to make people see and feel.8  | THE ROAR of the batteries beside Charleston Harbor . . . writes Professor Ralph Henry Gabriel announced the defeat of American political democracy . If political democracy be defined as government by consent of the governed , the shells over Sumter made clear that a large minority among the American people had withdrawn their consent from the existing federal institutions . If the definition be that democracy is government by discussion among free men , the arguments of statesmen were silenced by those of the cannon . If democracy is merely government by the majority , the American majority in 1861 was seeking to enforce , at the point of the bayonet , its will upon a recalcitrant and determined minority . By any definition , political democracy had , for the time being , lapsed . " 1 In 1860 , the federal government which was to preside over this temporary lapse was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its problems were similar to those of Washington 's day , although the nation which it served had grown enormously . The population had increased from about 4,000,000 to about 31,000,000 , * the area from 820,000 square miles to 3,000,000 , and the states from 13 to 33 . As a result , the Senate had 66 members in 1860 and the House 237 ; yet this inflated Congress still dealt almost exclusively with the problems which had harassed it from the beginning : the tariff , slavery , the disposition of public lands , and internal improvements at federal expense . Although on these perennial subjects the negative policies long favored by the South were about to be abandoned , the government was still innocent of plans for social or economic legislation , and its tax program suggested the Arcadian youth of the world rather than harsh modernity . Jackson and Polk had long since shown the latent powers of the Executive and Lincoln was about to transform the office wholly ; but before 1861 no President had in the modern sense imposed strong leadership upon Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be adequate to staff a modern bank . The Department of State , for example , consisted of the Secretary of State with a salary of $8000 , an assistant secretary with a salary of $3000 , a chief clerk with footnote * Nine million in what was to become the Confederate South , 22,000,000 in the North .  | a salary of $2200 , and two minor aids with salaries of $2000 . The War Department had no Assistant Secretary ; but it had one aid with a salary of $2200 and eight other employees who received $1800 apiece . The Post Office Department was more regal . It had three Assistant Postmasters General who received $3000 each , and three other officers whose salaries averaged $2500 . Today , as Professor Swisher points out , " the annual expenditure on the New York Police Department alone approaches the amount of the entire annual expenditure on the government of the United States in 1860 . " The most arresting sign of simplicity in the federal government of Civil War days was the absence of the so-called " fourth branch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a Judiciary , as originally planned . There was as yet no federal regulation of private enterprise , so there were no independent regulatory commissions , no ambiguous agencies with part-administrative , part-legislative , and partjudicial powers . The American people had not yet lost their fight to maintain a government with strictly limited powers . They were about to dismember their country because to a large minority even the small powers which existed had come to seem oppressive ; but in their worst nightmares they could not yet imagine the national state which the Industrial Revolution and the Civil War were to bring to birth . Lincoln , who began by pointing out that the public servants had " but little power for mischief , " was soon compelled to extend that power ? for good or evil ? until the old America could scarcely recognize the new . For a third time in a hundred years writes Professor Dunning the conviction " of a fact beat down the obstacles of established forms . The revolution of 1776 secured liberty ; that of 1789 secured federal union ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case traditional principles were felt to be incompatible with existing facts , and the old gave way to the new . The question presented to the administration by the commencement of hostilities was : Has this government the power to preserve its authority over all its territory ? The answer of the old school of constitutional lawyers was : " Yes , so far as it is conferred by the constitution and the laws " ; but the answer we derive from the actual conduct of the war is " Yes " without qualification . ' Here lay the difference between Lincoln and Buchanan . Following correctly the precedents of seventy years , Buchanan decided that a state had no right to secede and that the federal government had no right to keep it from seceding . The relative strength of federal and state sovereignty had been left vague in the Constitution ? wisely , for it could only be defined by force . In 1832 , during the nullification crisis , Calhoun raised the question in all its perilous logic ; but Henry Clay sidestepped it so  | skillfully that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been agreed . The nation returned to its healthy habit of evasion. , The only constitutional course writes Dunning in case of a conflict of the " sovereignties " was to deny that such a thing was possible , eulogize the constitution as the greatest extant production of the human intellect , point out the dreadful consequences that would follow the recognition of supremacy in either claimant , and end by compromising the difficulty in such a way as to furnish precedents for both sides in the future . It would be erroneous to maintain that this method of action was as unprofitable as it was illogical . On the contrary , it was probably the only course that could have brought the United States intact through to the year eighteen hundred and sixty . But more than one of the nation 's true statesmen foresaw that it was only a question of time when " dodging the issue " would cease to give satisfaction as a principle of constitutional construction . ' When that time came , Buchanan clung to the old ambiguities even though they threatened the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conviction of a fact beat down the obstacles of established forms . " When the people of the North had made clear that they would follow him , he announced that the federal overnment was sovereign and that the states were not . " What is ov ? ereignty ' in the poT Cat sense - oi erm. ' he asked in his message to the special session of Congress on July 4 , 1861 . " Would it be far wrong to define it as a political community without a political superior ' ? " Since the Union was sovereign in this sense , the states could not be sovereign . By seceding they had forced a final clarification . When they lost the war they lost the ancient argument . Thenceforth they would have certain powers conferred upon them by the Constitution ; but the federal government would be supreme . The American political democracy whose temporary defeat was announced by the shells over Fort Sumter would one day be restored ? but never in the form which it had known for the previous seventy years . A precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's insistence that the North was fighting to save the Union , and thus to save the world 's faith in democracy , did not please the radicals in his own party. * They were fighting to destroy slavery ? some of them footnote * During the war and the Reconstruction , the so-called " radicals " were those who wished to uproot the historic South and plant in its place something nearer to their own desires .

" Their motives were various and their political abilities noteworthy .  | because they saw it as the greatest of evils , and others because they saw it as the keystone of the Southern economy . Good men who only wished to help the Negro worked closely with men who only wished to break the South financially , so as to break her politically and ensure a long rule for the Republicans . Both the selfless and the selfish radicals found Lincoln a steady and a wily foe ? which was fortunate for their own cause , because if they had imposed their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been lost . Few Northern states would have voted for an abolitionist war , and the whole Border would have joined the Confederacy if such a war had been proclaimed . Yet there were many who sought to proclaim it . In July , 1861 , John C. Fremont was appointed to command in Missouri . Fremont 's great days were done , but his ambitions were as pushing as ever , and his jealousy of Lincoln ( who had replaced him at the head of the Republican Party ) was cruel . When Fremont 's shady friends were charged with corruption , and the powerful Blair family pressed for his removal , he tried to win favor with the radicals by declaring that all slaves of Southern sympathizers in Missouri were free . Lincoln , with his eye on the border states , asked Fremont to recall his order . Fremont refused , so Lincoln recalled the order and the general at the same time . The radicals now had an abolitionist hero , a victim of Lincoln 's conservatism . Thenceforth , the more foolish of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next election . In December , 1861 , the radicals in Congress set up a joint Committee on the Conduct of the War , ostensibly to inquire into the management of hostilities , but really to harry generals who were not sufficiently proNegro , to give leadership to the drive for abolition , and to prepare men 's minds for a ruthless post-war policy toward the South . Although the radicals were still a small minority , in a few years they were to inherit the fruits of Lincoln 's caution . They could not have won the war ; but they proved competent to stain the peace . Had radicals like John Andrew* writes Professor Hesseltine taken the pains to analyze the political situation in 1861 , they would have discovered that , outside New England , only the Iowa Republicans had proved strong enough to win without Democratic support . Such an analysis might have indicated that Lincoln 's cautious policy , his conciliation of border-state unionists , and his support of War Democrats met the approval of the Northern voters . But cautious analysis was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination to crush slavery and subjugate the South . The party , the army , and the national government were but tools for their purpose , and Lincoln 's moderate program only an obstacle before their goal . ' footnote * The governor of Massachusetts .  | Yet the situation in Kentucky alone should have been enough to make them pause . Lincoln had truly said that " to lose Kentucky is nearly . . . to lose the whole game . Kentucky gone , we can not hold Missouri , nor , as I think , Maryland . These all against us , and the job on our hands is too large for us . We would as well consent to separation at once , including the surrender of this capital . " Heedless of these facts , the radicals would have driven Kentucky into the Confederacy . The governor 's sympathies were with the South , the legislature 's with the North . The people were sharply divided , except on two points : they did not wish to see their slaves confiscated , and they did not wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation . So long as the war was for the Union , and not for abolition or the subjugation of the South , and so long as Lincoln promised to send no troops through Kentucky , that state would remain " neutral " ; that is , she would not leave the Union , and she would compel her Confederate sympathizers to do their fighting elsewhere . This would suffice to ensure a Northern victory ; but this the radicals would have prevented . In May , 1862 , in spite of Lincoln 's treatment of Fremont the previous year , General David Hunter , commanding the Department of the South , issued an order freeing all the slaves in South Carolina , Georgia , and Florida . Lincoln again declared that the general had exceeded his authority and that the order was void ; and the abolitionists again attacked the President for moral cowardice . In the following month the New England governors met at Providence , Rhode Island , to devise means for forcing the President 's hand . They wanted a change of generals , a change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward slavery . The war had been going badly and discontent was inevitable . Lincoln would have to yield somewhere . He had already gladly rid himself of the undesirable Cameron , sending him as Minister to Russia . Edwin McMasters Stanton of Ohio became Secretary of War ? a lifelong Democrat who was approved by the radicals . Stanton had served as Attorney General during Buchanan 's last months , and was one of the ablest lawyers in the country . He had a rough harsh manner and a parade of efficiency . Unhappily , he was as bad an administrator as Cameron , and far more self-satisfied ; but at least he was honest , so one source of scandal was eliminated. * The Providence meeting was followed in September by a meeting of the Union governors at Altoona , Pennsylvania . Under pressure from the radical New Englanders there might have come a demand for far- footnote * Even as temperate a critic as Hamilton Fish , who agreed with Lincoln 's war aims and his mild policy of Reconstruction , felt the Administration was lax in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thievery , speculation and special privilege , corroding the nation 's character . " Some people are making lots of money , " he wrote disgustedly , " and they are some other people 's friends . "  | reaching changes in war aims . There might even have come a demand for putting Fremont in charge of the Northern armies ? a ready and easy device for losing the war . ' But Lincoln outmaneuvered the governors . The day before the Altoona meeting , the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation was announced in the press . This conceded very little , yet it deprived the radicals of their most useful complaint . Lincoln had done all in his power to avoid emancipation by federal fiat . He had labored , as his latest biographer7 says , with " pathetic earnestness " to have the slaves set free by state action , with federal compensation to their owners . But when the war dragged on miserably and unsuccessfully , foreign opinion alone required that something be done to prove that Northern victory meant the end of the disgrace of human bondage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the loss of English workingclass support , for at least until 1863 the rulers of England were playing with the thought of announcing that Jefferson Davis had built a nation . Such recognition would have broken the Northern blockade , and would either have lost or dismally prolonged the war . In July , 1862 , therefore , Lincoln decided that after the next victory in the field he would declare freedom for the slaves of all who persisted in rebellion . He could not do more , for he had no power over private property in the loyal slave states. * And he could scarcely do less , for his proclamation had no effect in the states where it was alleged to apply . Yet it seized men 's minds , and to this day the world thinks of Lincoln , not as the savior of the United States , but as the Great Emancipator . On September 17 , 1862 , the battle of Antietam ( which nobody won ) was followed by General Lee 's withdrawal from Maryland . This seemed the best Lincoln could expect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so while the dissatisfied governors were assembling in Pennsylvania the President bewildered them by announcing that " persons held as slaves " within areas " in rebellion against the United States " would be free on and after January 1 , 1863 . He repeated that Union was the sole war aim , and that he still hoped and wished for compensated emancipation . He dodged the constitutional problem by treating his Proclamation as a war measure , a penalty for rebellion which anyone could avoid by ceasing to rebel during the hundred days between September and January . The document was wholly in keeping with his famous letter to Horace Greeley of August , 1862 , in which Lincoln wrote : My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union , and is not either to save or destroy slavery . If I could save the Union without freeing any slave , I would do it ; and if I could save it by freeing all the footnote * Delaware , Maryland , Kentucky , Missouri ? and West Virginia after June , 1863 , when the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | slaves , I would do it ; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone , I would also do that . What I do about slavery , and the coloured race , I do because I believe it helps to save the Union ; and what I forbear , I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union . I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause , and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause . If , as seems clear , Lincoln believed that to help the cause he must keep the impetuous governors quiet and keep the workingmen of England friendly , his preliminary Proclamation ( which was followed by the final deed on January 1 ) succeeded . The governors , instead of blasting his Administration and his generals , sent him a humble message of thanks and of " most loyal and cordial support . " And the workingmen of Manchester , assembled at the Free-Trade Hall , sent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endured because of the blockade on Southern cotton , and only implored Lincoln , for your own honor and welfare , not to faint in your providential mission . While your enthusiasm is aflame , and the tide of events runs high , let the work be finished effectually . . . . Our interests . . . are identified with yours . We are truly one people , though locally separate . And if you have any ill-wishers here , be assured they are chiefly those who oppose liberty at home , and that they will be powerless to stir up quarrels between us , from the very day in which your country becomes , undeniably and without exception , the home of the free . Lincoln in his answer said he knew the South had counted on a demand from Manchester that the blockade be broken in order that the textile mills should reopen . I know and deeply deplore he wrote the sufferings which the working-men at Manchester , and in all Europe , are called to endure in this crisis . . . Under the circumstances I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an instance of sublime Christian heroism which has not been surpassed in any age or in any country . The Proclamation , though timely and useful , roused bitter feeling at home . Northern Democrats who had supported the war felt betrayed . They would fight for the Union , they said angrily , but not for the destruction of other men 's property . The legislature of Lincoln 's own state resolved that the Proclamation was a gigantic usurpation , at once converting the war , professedly commenced by the administration for the vindication of the authority of the Constitution , into a crusade for the sudden , unconditional and violent liberation of 3,000,000 Negro slaves ; a result which would not only be a total subversion of the federal Union but a revolution in the social or-  | ganization of the southern states , the immediate and remote , the present and far-reaching consequences of which to both races can not be contemplated without the most dismal foreboding of horror and dismay . The wide acceptance of this conservative view , and thus the folly of the radicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mid-term elections of 1862 . The Emancipation Proclamation ( in spite of its mildness ) , war weariness and the continued Northern defeats , difficulties in raising troops and the knowledge that the Administration would soon adopt the hated draft ? all this made for Republican weakness . Ohio and Indiana and Pennsylvania held Congressional elections in October . The Democrats won heavily in the first two states , and in the last they elected half the new Congressmen . In November , therefore , troops were sent home from the field to vote Republican in the critical states ; but still the Democrats won Illinois and Wisconsin . They might have won control of Congress , they might even have compelled a negotiated peace , had not the border states , soothed by Lincoln and patrolled by troops , and diligently combed of anti-war voters under Lincoln 's suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act , returned enough Republicans to ensure a small majority . " The lesson was clear enough , " writes Professor Hesseltine . " The governors had lost the power to control their states ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the polls . Only the President could preserve the party ? and he could save it only through the methods that had been tested in Missouri , Kentucky , Maryland and Delaware . " 8 Since those methods combined the maximum of concession and of emphasis on the Union with the maximum of repression against those who could not be wooed or wheedled , and since the Republicans barely succeeded even so , it is plain why Lincoln grew impatient when the radicals insisted upon a different and an impossible war . The elections of 1864 were an even clearer proof of the wisdom of the middle-of-the-road policy , and of the fact that no one but Lincoln could hold together the confused , war-weary North . Before the end of 1863 the long tide of military defeat had turned , with the result that the weakness and quarrels within the Administration , which had been based upon failure , were replaced by larger weakness and bitterer quarrels based upon the expectation of success . The radicals became far more intractable when they felt victory in the air . So in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew would be a stern struggle for control when the conventions and the campaign drew near , Lincoln announced his post-war program for the Reconstruction and readmission of the rebel states . The program  | fitted the temper of the war which Lincoln had fought and defended . But it did not fit the war of Charles Sumner , who was prepared to postpone the rebuilding of the Union until the Negro was everywhere acknowledged as the social and legal equal of the white man . And it did not fit the war of Thaddeus Stevens , the lame , vindictive invalid from Pennsylvania , who was ready to poison the future rather than permit the Democratic Party to rise again to power . Stevens was one of the most forceful men ever to sit in Congress . James A. Blaine called him " the natural leader , who assumed his place by common consent . " " Yet as he grew older he grew steadily more bitter , and by the eighteen-sixties he could only harm whatever he touched . His wish to help the Negro brought fresh woe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1782 , of very poor parents . He was educated at Dartmouth College and then moved to Pennsylvania where he became a lawyer and a partner in an iron business . He was first a Federalist , then an Anti-Mason , then a Whig ? being drawn to protection and the National Bank by his business interests . Always he fought with bitterness and wrath for the unprivileged , and in his youth his tongue was not yet so noxious as to undo his good intentions . In 1834 and 1835 , for instance , he helped to win a free-school system for Pennsylvania . In 1848 he went to Congress , where his true passion for the oppressed led him into the anti-slavery fight . He was so skillfully offensive that every time he spoke he brought war nearer . Later , he helped found the Republican Party in Pennsylvania . He hoped for Cameron 's post in Lincoln 's Cabinet , but had to be content with the chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee in the House , where he was useful in pushing the wartime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he helped the Administration , for his views on the war were the reverse of Lincoln 's . He wanted to arm the slaves , expropriate the whites , reduce the South to " hopeless feebleness , " desolate the region , exterminate the rebels , erase the state lines , and recolonize the entire district.10 Stevens had no compassion , no understanding of man 's divided heart . He could only hate , and persecute , and use his wide learning as a quarry for unrivaled abuse . He hated the sinner more than the sin , the slaveowner more than slavery , and his hate extended to all Southerners and thence to all Democrats . Inevitably , he stirred a resistance more implacable than his own dark soul . " Yes , " wrote a Georgian to Stevens in 1866 , " I am disloyal to any damned Government ruled by such men as you , and glory that I still live to hate you . ' " The Negro was , and is , the chief sufferer from the curse that Thaddeus Stevens laid upon the South . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plan for Reconstruction was whether the states which had seceded were still states under the original compact , or whether ( as Sumner was to contend ) they  | had committed suicide and were to be considered territories , subject to the rule of Congress . Lincoln 's answer was clear . In his Inaugural Address he had said that the Union could not be broken by a pretended act of secession . In a proclamation of August , 1861 , he had said that the people of the Confederacy were in rebellion , not the states of the Confederation . In all his deeds and speeches , Lincoln held to this view . The rebellion* was blamed upon groups of conspirators , not upon states ? with the result that Southerners who would rebuild the Union could be treated , not as members of a hostile nation , but as so many steadfast Abdiels , loyal in spite of the wiles of Lucifer : Among the faithless , faithful only he ; Among innumerable false , unmoved , Unshaken , unseduced , unterrified . This was gratifying for Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who merely wished to improve them , it would not do at all . Sumner knew that the Abdiels of the South did not mean to make the freedmen members of their clubs . So he did not admit a distinction between those Southerners who would be loyal to the Union and those who hated it . " He would shed tears , " writes Professor Dunning , " at the bare thought of refusing to freedmen rights of which they had no comprehension , but would filibuster to the end of the session to prevent the restoration to the southern whites of rights which were essential to their whole concept of life . " 12 Yet Sumner was something of a humanitarian and something of a gentleman . Thaddeus Stevens , who was neither , had still less thought of admitting that the South contained even a single " flaming Seraph , fearless though alone . " On December 8 , 1863 , when Lincoln issued his proclamation , he assumed that certain state governments had been subverted by persons in rebellion and that some of these persons now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So he announced that with the exception of important civil and military officers of the Confederacy anyone would be granted an amnesty who took an oath of allegiance to the United States . And when ten per cent of the people of any state had taken the oath , they might hold elections and establish a state government . The radicals , of course , deplored this act , for such a prompt amnesty meant the restoration of confiscated property ( other than slaves ) , and it meant that there could be no vengeance . If the states had committed suicide , as Sumner believed , or if they were conquered provinces , as Stevens contended , the Congress could do as it pleased both with Southern property and Southern people . But if the states were still alive , with their local footnote * The words " rebel " and " rebellion " are used throughout , not invidiously , but because the South lost the war . The difference between a rebel and a father of his people is a matter of success .  | powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands off the Southerners who returned to an honest loyalty , and off their goods , and would even have to allow them the dangerous right of voting for the Democratic Party if they so chose . The extreme radicals were not yet in charge of Congress ; but they were able to pass a bill which made the conditions of pardon far more stringent , and which declared that Congress , not the Executive , must decide the time and the manner of Reconstruction . This was the Wade-Davis Bill , named after the coarse , noisy Senator Benjamin Franklin Wade of Ohio and the polished but hate-ridden Representative Henry Winter Davis of Maryland . Davis was the author of the bill . Like Thaddeus Stevens , he was a disappointed candidate for the Cabinet . He also hated Lincoln for seizing so much power and for brushing aside the Constitution on the plea of necessity ? as in the suspension of habeas corpus and the imprisoning of thousands without trial . Congress adjourned within ten days of passing the Wade-Davis Bill , so under the Constitution the President could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . And when he issued another proclamation renewing his promise of recognition to seceding states if loyal citizens would quickly reform their governments , the helpless radicals raged. * Even before the " pocket veto " some of them had been looking for a candidate to replace Lincoln in the campaign . Their choice had been the Secretary of the Treasury , Salmon P. Chase of Ohio ; but Lincoln had eliminated this rival with little trouble . At the Baltimore Convention in June , where the party had been careful to conceal the name " Republican " and to refer to itself only as the Union Party , the delegates had renominated Lincoln without discussion and had obeyed his wish to drop Vice-President Hamlin and to substitute Andrew Johnson of Tennessee ? thus making the party seem less sectional , and paying tribute to Southern friends of the Union . A few weeks later Chase had been removed from the Cabinet and Senator William P. Fessenden of Maine took his place. ** Foreseeing the defeat of Chase , another group of radicals had combined with Western war Democrats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to get rid of Fremont . He made a bargain of some sort with the radicals ? perhaps promising to remove the ultra-conservative Montgomery Blair from the Cabinet in return for Fremont 's retirement . This was the end of the " Pathfinder , " who on September 22 withdrew ungracefully into a private life which was thence- footnote * Characteristically , Lincoln also declared that the Wade-Davis plan was a " proper " one , and that he would welcome back any states which wished to return to the Union by that plan . He must have been trying , as usual , to soften antagonisms ; but in this case his enemies would not be softened . ** In October , when Roger Taney died , Lincoln made Chase Chief Justice of the United States .  | forth only redeemed by the affection and support of the ever-faithful , evercompetent , and ever-romantic Jessie. * A third effort to rid themselves of Lincoln was made by the radicals in August , 1864 . Although the election was hard upon them , and defeat more than possible , Wade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die without even the dignity of a veto message that they issued a manifesto attacking the President 's " executive usurpation , " which they said was " a studied outrage on the legislative authority . " With the support of Horace Greeley , whose political judgment was the worst available , they suggested to the Republican politicians that a new convention be held to reconsider Lincoln 's candidacy . This final revolt against the President 's conservative leadership broke against the hard unwelcome truth that the very men who led the revolt might lose their jobs unless Lincoln led the ticket . So with ill grace , but with sufficient energy to save their party standing , the radicals ( including Wade and Davis ) at last accepted Lincoln and closed ranks for victory . Victory seemed far from certain in the late summer of 1864 . In spite of his hold over the army ( where the men in the ranks knew him for a natural democrat ) , in spite of Sherman 's capture of Atlanta on September 1 ( and the seeming certainty of Northern victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receivers of patronage and all the beneficiaries of the Republican tariff , the Republican Homestead Act , and the new Republican National Bank , Lincoln still felt in danger . And indeed without the soldier vote he might have lost.14 Certainly , if the party had been so foolish as to repudiate Lincoln , it would have been ruined . In 1860 , as Professor Hesseltine points out , the governors and the state organizations elected Lincoln ; but in 1864 Lincoln elected them . The Democrats had met at Chicago in August and nominated General George B. McClellan for the presidency . McClellan was certainly the most learned , and was in many ways the most expert , of the Union commanders with whom Lincoln struggled and suffered until he found Grant . Robert E. Lee thought McClellan the best of the Northern generals . Yet he seemed temperamentally averse to action . The question which shadowed his reputation at the time , and which has not been answered yet , was put to him by Lincoln in October , 1863 : " Are you not overcautious when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly doing ? " After many heartbreaking delays , demotions , and reinstatements , Lincoln retired him for good in November , 1863 . The troops liked McClellan , and footnote * The radical Senator Zachariah Chandler of Michigan , in his letters to his wife , claimed to have arranged the Blair-Fremont bargain . Burton J. Hendrick ( Lincoln 's War Cabinet , pp. 457 ? 59 ) is inclined to dispute the claim , and to explain Blair 's resignation on the ground that it had been requested by the Union National Convention . In any case , Fremont did give up his candidacy the day before Blair gave up his Cabinet post .  | he gave a high tone and competence to his army ; yet Lincoln may be excused for wondering whether , by McClellan 's methods , the war could ever end . The Democratic Party which nominated McClellan in 1864 was held together by nothing but hope for office . It had lost most of its trained political brains when the Southern states seceded , and the rest of them when Stephen A. Douglas died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1861 , the Democrats did not even hold a caucus and name a candidate for Speaker . They joined with the Republicans to form a new party of the Union , and there they might have remained throughout the war except that Lincoln did not have enough important jobs to go round . Before long , therefore , some of the Democratic leaders reminded themselves that it is the duty of an Opposition to oppose . Yet Lincoln held many of the " War Democrats " to the end . Some of them stayed with the Republican Party in the post-war period , after it emerged from its Union phase . Others drifted back to the Democrats during the fight over Reconstruction . And a fair number left Lincoln while the war was in progress , and joined the " Peace Democrats " in opposing the unconstitutional acts of the President . Thus the party of Andrew Jackson found itself attacking an Old Whig for his use of dictatorial powers ! The eac . ecrats ? known as " Copperheads , " and sometimes as " Butternuts " ? did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abolitionists , whom they blamed for all the ' woe : " T'Mybelieved that the South could never be conquered , which was a possibility . And they believed that the Union could be restored by negotiation , which was absurd . A partial explanation for this faith may be found in the economic interests of the Copperheads . Fernando Wood of New York , for example , was mayor of a city whose merchants were owed a hundred and sixty-nine million dollars by Southern customers . It would not be reasonable to expect him to join with Thaddeus Stevens in demanding the ruin of the South . Similarly , the most famous of the Copperheads , Clement L. Vallandigham of Ohio , represented a section which would be equally hurt by secession or by armed opposition to secession . In Vallandigham 's words , they wanted " the Constitution as it is and the Union as it was " ? and they wanted it so badly that they persuaded themselves they could have it , if only Lincoln would stop fighting . We have seen many times that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote in sympathy with the South . The early settlers had been of Southern stock , with Southern prejudices about slavery ; but more important , the district was tied to the South by trade . Wheat , flour , beef , pork , lard , whisky , and manufactured products writes Professor Binkley , particularly from Cincinnati , the Wabash and  | Illinois valleys , had passed down the Mississippi River and were , in no small degree , paid for by the counter traffic in molasses , sugar , and cotton . The loss of their bacon market alone in the South because of the war was estimated at $6,000,000 . Only a few days before Lincoln 's inauguration the Cincinnati Enquirer was insisting that the prosperity of the entire lower West depended on the Southern trade and the continued culture of cotton in the South through slave labour.15 These were Vallandigham 's people , to whom he was a true and fearless friend . No wonder he had a large following . And since , in addition to being fearless , he was wholly without judgment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he landed in jail , exile , and conspiracy . When the Democrats nominated McClellan they did not choose to attack the Republican ( or Union ) tariff , although by the time the war ended the average rates were forty-seven per cent ? more than double the average for 1857 . And they did not choose to attack the Republican ( or Union ) banking system set up by the Acts of 1863 and 1864 , although the party of Andrew Jackson might have found something to say about the concentration of money in the Eastern cities , especially in New York . And they did not choose to attack the Homestead Act , * or even the Acts of 1862 and 1864 which donated more than thirty million acres of public lands to the Western railroads . In all this they were wise . The war was the issue , not yet the domestic economy . The Democrats must stand or fall by what they said about the war . It is instructive to study what they did say , and astonishing to remember that until the last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked the Administration for the suspension of habeas corpus and for all the other violations of civil liberties , for the use of troops to police and influence border-state elections , and for the vast increase of federal powers ( especially of Executive powers ) which Lincoln had brought to pass in the name of the emergency . These were true grievances against the war . The platform then stated , in all its pathetic absurdity , the Vallandigham peace policy : Resolved , That this convention does explicitly declare . . . that after four years of failure to restore the Union by the experiment of war , during which , under the pretense of a military necessity of war- footnote * Signed by Lincoln on May 20 , 1862 .

Yet the politicians were merely following their normal course . They needed the votes of the people who thought the war was a failure , so the platform called it a failure . They needed the votes of the people who thought the war was a sacred cause , so the candidate was a leading Union general . And above all they needed the votes of the people who were tired and lazy and who wanted the fruits of victory ? a " federal Union of the states " ? with no further strain ; so they announced that the Union could be restored simply by stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought this was carrying cynicism too far . Yet the Democrats received 1,802,000 votes . Lincoln received 2,213,000 votes . In the electoral college Lincoln had 212 votes and McClellan 21 . The figures sound overwhelming ; yet , as late as September the Republicans feared that if the army were not sent home to vote where needed , and if fraud were not practiced where all else failed , McClellan might win . In retrospect , we can see that the frauds and intimidations practiced by the Union Party in 1864 were unnecessary . Lincoln would have won anyway , even if no " steps " had been taken . Yet it is interesting that Lincoln slid not choose to run the risk . He allowed the small frauds , as he had allowed the steady unconstitutional pressure on the border states throughout the war , not because he felt superior to the people , but because he felt he knew their needs and must safeguard their future . This is a perilous decision for the head of a free state . Lincoln made it in silence and on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war : to reinforce Sumter ; to suspend habeas corpus and pay no heed to the protests of the Chief Justice ; to ask for troops without authority ; to start the fighting before he called Congress in 1861 , so that he could present that body with a war which was already under way and which must be won ; to  | build for the first time in American history a national army serving the national state , instead of depending on local forces which had long been thought the safeguard of republican freedom . President Madison very nearly lost the War of 1812 rather than override the prejudice against a draft and a national army . He would have lost if the British had been more alert ? and the Union would then have perished , if the Hartford Convention had its way . But when Lincoln decided to fight he decided to win . As Alexander Stephens , his admiring enemy , said : " The Union with him , in sentiment , rose to the sublimity of religious mysticism . " Yet the Union might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college . This was more than Lincoln would permit . New York ? one of the six crucial states ? allowed its soldiers to vote in the field . Each party sent three commissioners to supervise the voting ; but the Democratic commissioners were put in jail in Washington , and McClellan votes were switched when necessary . Lincoln won New York by 368,000 votes to 362,000 . In Connecticut , where Lincoln won by 2400 votes , and in Maryland where he won by 7000 , there seems little doubt that fraud and the army helped to carry the day . In Ohio ? whose soldiers also voted in the field and might have voted for Ohio 's General McClellan , the methods used to insure acceptable results remind one of the twentieth century.16 Assuming that they were necessary for victory , were these thefts wrong ? Assuming that Lincoln had lost all the states where frauds were permitted , he would then have lost the electoral college , and thus the election ; but he would still have had a majority of the votes . His own followers plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the war would still have been lost . The Democrats were pledged to a peace conference , and once the war stopped no one could start it again . Hundreds of thousands of young men had died , in the armies which Lincoln had assembled , for the cause which Lincoln had defined . They had almost won their war . Should Lincoln now give it away for an eighteenth-century plan of choosing presidents ? a plan which had been abandoned in spirit before that century was out ? How could he do the least harm ? by cheating , or by allowing accidental circumstances to cheat ? All these questions ? like that of the morality of seizing " unconstitutional " powers ? are implicit in the very idea of civil war . We have no record of what Lincoln thought , only of what he did . He built a temporary dictatorship , brushing the Constitution aside when he thought necessary , and custom and legality as well . He changed the balance of powers within the government . Thenceforth , on a plea of emergency , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dared to dream . And the world was presently to move into a phase of  | almost laermanent emergency . Before those days came , Lincoln had given his country - not only a renewed Union but a federal government which was admittedly supreme over the states , and a presidency which had been made ( and could again be made ) supreme over the Congress . We do not know whether he approved the latter change , or whether , like doctoring the soldiers ' votes from New York , he merely did it to win . In April , 1865 , the Confederate Government was at last driven from Richmond . Within a week General Lee had surrendered to General Grant at Appomattox , and on April 26 General Johnston surrendered the last important Southern army to General Sherman. * The war was over . It had accomplished its purpose ; but like all wars it had raised more questions than it settled . The Union was saved ; but it was not the federal Union of old . It was a national state wherein the central government alone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means reconciled to such a change , and were soon found devising methods for creating unofficially the system of concurrent majorities which Calhoun had wished to write into the Constitution . And slavery was abolished ; but what of the freedmen ? And what of the broken South ? What of the balance of power at Washington , where the agrarian statesmen had long held aggressive capitalism at bay ? Since the agrarian leaders were dead or banished , was the simplicity and idealism of the young republic to be swamped in millionaires ? And above all , what of the strife between the men who wanted punishment and plunder , and the men who followed Lincoln in seeking justice ? Was America to go forward , as Lincoln asked in the second Inaugural Address , " with malice toward none , with charity for all . . . to bind up the nation 's wounds " ? Or was she to be subjected for a time to an alliance of moral prigs , vindictive politicians , and greedy businessmen ? The problem was exacerbated by John Wilkes Booth , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at Ford 's Theater in Washington . Booth was an actor who had played Brutus once too often . Born and raised in Maryland , he saw the war neatly and simply as a strife between the wicked North and the chivalrous South . He and some friends had planned to kidnap Lincoln and deliver him to Jefferson Davis at Richmond ; but their footnote * Jefferson Davis , hoping to escape to the Southwest and carry on the war by sheer will power , was captured on May 10 . The last Confederate force surrendered on May 26 . Davis was sent to prison at Fortress Monroe , and released after two years on the grounds that the federal lawyers had failed to find a charge on which they thought it safe to try him . He lived for another twenty-two years ? farming , writing The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government , and refusing to ask for the federal pardon which would have allowed his state to send him back to Washington as Senator .  | first attempt fell through and the war ended before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President , the Vice-President , and the Secretary of State all on the same evening . Booth did his work tragically well , but his assistants bungled theirs . The radicals of course claimed that the mad crime was a plot by the South , promoted by Jefferson Davis . They staged , a " trial " that will forever disgrace them , wherein the defense was bullied and the prosecution suppressed Booth 's diary because it proved that the charges against Davis and the South were monstrous nonsense . They did their best to stir the North to the most barren and hurtful of passions : revenge . They did their best to make Lincoln 's life vain and his death dishonored . At his last Cabinet meeting , on the day he died , Lincoln showed that he knew the dangers which came with long-desired peace , and that he hoped to surmount some of them . According to the Secretary of the Navy , who was present , Lincoln said that " he thought it providential that this great rebellion was crushed just as Congress had adjourned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that body to hinder and embarrass us . If we were wise and discreet , we should reanimate the States and get their governments in successful operation , with order prevailing and the Union reestablished , before Congress came together in December . " These were strange words from the defender of American democracy . " So long as the people 's representatives are absent , " he seemed to be saying , " there is reasonable hope of doing what is right . If we work quickly and present Congress with a peace that can not be poisoned ? just as we presented it , in 1861 , with a war that could not be stopped ? all may yet be well . " Had Lincoln been so long accustomed to a dictator 's power that he feared returning to the slow process of persuasion ? Or was it merely the " disturbing elements of that body " which he had in mind when he spoke of Congress ? the malignant , the mean of spirit and black of heart ? He had fought and mastered those elements when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could no longer control them now that they sought only to destroy the peace ? We do not know ; but at the same Cabinet meeting he said he hoped there would be no persecution , no bloody work after the war was over . Such hopes died with Lincoln , and footnote * Gideon Welles , " Lincoln and Johnson , " in The Galaxy , April , 1872 , p. 526 . In his Diary for April 14 , 1865 , Welles also noted that Lincoln " was glad Congress was not in session . " ( Vol . II , p. 281 . ) And Nicolay and Hay describe the last Cabinet meeting in language similar to that of Welles in his Galaxy article . ( Vol . X , p. 283 . ) There seems no doubt that Welles gave an accurate description of Lincoln 's remarks .  | so did the hopes for an honorable solution to the racial problem , whereby the Negro could quickly become a first-class citizen . Lincoln was gone but Thaddeus Stevens lived . It was an enigmatic spirit which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . Lincoln never sought to explain or excuse himself , only to make lucid the cause for which he lived . Grierson describes a pioneer woman of Illinois , a contemporary of Lincoln 's , in these words : Moulded and subdued by the lonely days , the monotonous weeks , the haunting hush of the silent nights , and the same thoughts and images returning again and again , she appeared as one who had conquered the world of silence . . . . Hers was a freedom which was not attained in a single battle ? the conflict was begun by her ancestors when they landed at Plymouth Rock . In the tribulations that followed the successive generations were stripped of the superfluities of life . One by one vanities and illusions fell from the fighters like shattered muskets and tattered garments . Each generation , stripped of the tinsel , became acquainted with the folly of plaints and the futility of protests . Little by little the pioneers began to understand , and in the last generation of all there resulted a knowledge too deep for discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Lincoln belonged to this " last generation of all " ; he too " had conquered the world of silence . " He knew that he must stand alone , decide alone , suffer and be blamed alone . He was gentle , unyielding , devious . Free from vanities and illusions , he had time to think . He saw so many levels deep into the motives and meanings of life that only his broad humor kept him from cynicism or despair . He knew far too much for comfort . He was a melancholy skeptic who seems to have understood that the world can not be saved on its own terms and that to resist one wrong in the realm of politics , by the use of force , is but to substitute another . " Each looked for an easier triumph , " he said , referring to the North and South in his second Inaugural Address , " and a result less fundamental and astounding . . . The prayers of both could not be answered . That of neither has been answered fully . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted that political parties must be organized , elections won , malefactors opposed , and sometimes wars fought , not because the results would be what anybody wanted or intended , but because man was not created to bow before iniquity . He must resist , although in the end he will be conquered ? if not by the evil he is fighting , then by the evil which rises from the fight itself . Jefferson , in spite of his magician 's power in politics , was too bland , too enlightened , too thoroughly eighteenth-century , for such stormy truth to reach the surface of his mind . Jefferson lived contentedly with the most worldly myth that has ever lulled man 's intelligence , hiding the disappoint-  | ment of the next step , of any next step on the material plane : the myth of humanism , of culture without religion , morality without a moral sanction , peace based on reason and freedom on utility . Lincoln lived in the world which had taken that particular step . He knew the glad tidings of the Deists were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched and his heart shared the troubles of man adrift , generous and selfish , magnanimous and V venal , but adrift , with no compass , a forgotten port , and a strong cold wind . He saw so much so quietly , accepting it without complaint or pretense , and still relishing the strife of the presidency . Like all the important Presidents he expanded the office ; but he expanded himself still more . Most men rattle about inside the job ; but Lincoln transcended it . Sometimes he seemed about to break its earthly bonds and seize the truth toward which he was groping . But he could not . He knew the vanity of this world . He knew that every secular victory must be soiled . So he could not fulfill himself in politics . And he could find nothing beyond . This is the burden of modern man at his wisest , which may explain why Lincoln was sorrowful .  | Congress versus the President WHEN THE WAR ENDED , the South was ruined physically but by no means deprived of hope . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies , out of a white population of about six million.l A quarter of the white men of productive age were either dead or incapacitated . The long blockade , the fact that most of the fighting was on Southern soil , the careful destruction of towns , roads , bridges , and railways by the Northern armies , the loss of almost two thirds of the livestock and of slave property worth $2,000,000,000 , the repudiation ( imposed by the North ) of the entire Confederate debt ? all this meant an equality of poverty and a return to the simplest survival-standard of life . Yet the land was still there , and the rivers , and the sun and rain ? and the Negro , although he had lost his cash value . The South was mostly a rural economy which could not be scared or starved by a breakdown of industry or of communications . If Northern politicians had kept their hands off , the South might have recovered quickly and with little bitterness . Indeed , her worst non-political disasters made for a renewed sense of kinship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the towns , Northern charity was quick with relief , and also when a yellow-fever epidemic began in the lower Mississippi Valley . The two chief Northern generals , Grant and Sherman , had been chivalrous in their terms of surrender ? in fact , the terms that the latter arranged had been repudiated by Congress on the ground that they were overfriendly . The South , during the war , had been too concerned with her own problems to notice the changes in the Northern government . She did not understand that the Union to which Lincoln invited her to return differed sharply from the Union she had deserted . Power , which had been concentrating in Washington , remained widely diffused in the South . The preamble to the Confederate Constitution proclaimed the sovereignty of the states . The " Old Republicans " of 1798 would have signed it joyfully , whereas ever since Jefferson and Hamilton first disputed with each other in Washington 's Cabinet , the preamble to the Federal Constitution had been a source of discord . " We the people of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form a more perfect union . . . do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America . " Did this mean that all  | the people joined together in one political body to form a nation ? Or did it mean that the people , meeting in their several sovereign states , and acting through the representatives of their states , ordained the new government ? Nobody knew . Possibly , nobody was intended to know . The fathers of the Constitution were not so foolish as to make clear troublesome statements when they might remain soothingly obscure . There was no obscurity , however , in the Confederate document . " We , the people of the Confederate states , " it says , " each state acting in its sovereign and independent character , in order to form a permanent federal government . . . do ordain and establish this Constitution . . . . " The South was handicapped throughout the war by her decentralized government ; but she accepted the handicap rather than permit that concentration of power against which Southern leaders had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , to discover that while her back was turned the old federal Union had abandoned even the polite fiction of divided sovereignty and had made the states little more than administrative units , possessed of many important powers of government but clearly subject to the nation . An administrative unit can not set its will against the central power and say that the Constitution has been misinterpreted by that power and that it will therefore disobey the law . In the future , regional and economic interests wishing to obstruct a distant majority would be forced to find subtler means than nullification. ** The South did not at first know this ; but her ignorance need have been no bar to Reconstruction . She would have accepted ( soon instead of slowly ) the war-born changes in the living Constitution , and she would have set herself ( at once , instead of after barren resentful years ) to devise new methods for warding off outside interference with her daily life , even if her economic fate must now be subject to faraway control . But the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods should prevail . And so far as the South knew , during the first footnote * Robert E. Lee , for example , was not appointed General-in-Chief of the Confederate armies until February , 1865 . Up to that time the governors insisted on having final word as to the use of troops raised in their states . And the central government at Richmond did not get authority to control the railroads for military purposes until February , 1865. ** Aside from making explicit the sovereignty of the states , the Confederate Constitution closely follows the Constitution of the United States . Three features of the Southern document , however , were intended as improvements based on the experience of seventy years ; first , the President was allowed to veto individual items in an appropriation bill , instead of having to accept or to reject the entire lump ; second , each bill passed by Congress was to deal with only one subject , and the subject was to be clearly defined in the title ; third , Congress was authorized to permit by statute the heads of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discussion of measures affecting their work . As we have seen , this was Alexander Hamilton 's view of the proper relation between the executive departments and the legislature . Unfortunately , the Confederate Congress never passed the authorizing act .  | strange hushed weeks after surrender , the spirit of Lincoln survived . Returning to Washington after Appomattox , and finding the city gay with celebration , Lincoln had made his last public speech . It was a simple , urgent plea that men begin to think at once and magnanimously about Reconstruction . He begged his hearers not to bother their minds with theories as to whether the seceding states had committed suicide or had merely been absent for a time . The point was to get them back into the Union comfortably and quickly . " Finding themselves safely at home , " he said , " it would be utterly immaterial whether they had ever been abroad . Let us all join in doing the acts necessary to restoring the proper practical relations between these states and the Union ; and each forever after innocently indulge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he brought the states from without into the Union , or only gave them proper assistance , they never having been out of it . " We need not speculate whether the nation would have followed such leadership , since it was not given the chance . But the South chose to believe as long as possible that what Lincoln said would prevail , and during those hopeful deluded days she showed that her own internal divisions had survived the war and that if she were allowed to return to the Union without bitterness she would return with a two-party system . The first postwar elections in the South showed the revived strength of the Whigs who had opposed secession , but had supported the war out of patriotism . The Republicans were wrong in assuming that the South would vote solidly Democratic . The South as a whole felt no debt to the Democratic Party of the North . Southern Whigs would have joined a moderate Union Party , such as Lincoln desired , and the region would have been saved from the seventy-year-long curse of a one-party system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic Party by identifying Republicanism with a policy that only the outcasts of the white world could support ? only the deserters , and the disaffected " poor whites , " and carpetbaggers , and those who thought to better themselves by betraying their neighbors . ' Unquestionably , among those evil-doing radicals were men of rigid principle , like Sumner , who thought that whatever the cost in hatred or in pain their methods were right because they would help the Negro . Only a subtle and humble mind can combine rigid principle with politics . The self-satisfied , the priggish , the morally superior , are more dangerous than the men who treat politics simply as a livelihood . The latter at least understand that politics is the pursuit of the possible , not of the ideal . They at least refrain from doing needless harm in the name of perfection . But the Sumners , the credulous , high-minded Sumners , are not only the victims of political vandals like Thaddeus Stevens , but of pride , the first of the deadly sins . The greater the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves as members of a dwindling band that " sticks to principles . " If the South had been revived with its old two-party system , normal political rivalry and search for votes might have enfranchised the Negro within a decade . Sumner preferred to enfranchise him at once ? which meant depriving him of his vote for two generations and debauching Southern politics by preventing the growth of an Opposition . When the war ended , the North was tired and overprosperous ? hence morally slack . Her losses had been heavy ? about three hundred and sixty thousand dead , out of a white population three and a half times that of the South . But the war had proved an economic stimulus . Government contracts and the high tariff were more than a substitute in most cases for the loss of Southern trade . Meat-packers of the Middle West and the shoe manufacturers of New England could not keep pace with army orders ; and although cotton textiles declined because of the shortage of raw materials , the manufacture of woolens increased inordinately . The infant oil industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the new national banking system promised to end the paper-money fantasies of the state banks . Farmers were helped both by the insatiable hunger of the armies and by several years of bad wheat crops in Europe . There was of course another side to the picture . The federal debt was more than $2,600,000,000 . Labor had shared little in the new prosperity , suffering from high prices , high taxes , military service ( since the poor could not take advantage of the clause in the draft law which allowed a man to be released on payment of $300 ) , and after 1864 from the system of " contract labor . " By an act of that year , alien labor contracts were made enforceable in the courts . This meant that American employers could hire foreigners abroad for next to nothing , bring them to America , and make them work for the derisory terms which they had accepted . The American workman was threatened by cheap foreign competition , whereas the American manufacturer was protected more thoroughly each year . This was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise " less benign than it sounded in the textbooks. * Also , the new banking system was scarcely a boon to the people in the back-country . " Though it had some merit , " writes Professor J. G. Randall , " it created an inelastic currency , tended toward the concentration of bank resources in New York and opened the way for serious abuses in the footnote * The law was repealed in 1868 ; but the practice continued until forbidden by the new law of 1885 . It was not wholly abandoned until 1907.  | speculative exploitation of bank funds . . . . " 3 Yet the system was a blessing compared to that which preceded it . From the days when Jackson and Van Buren destroyed the National Bank , but failed to find a substitute , the country had been at the mercy of state banks . Sometimes the state was the sole owner , sometimes a part owner ; but more often the banks were chartered by states and privately owned . In South Carolina , Missouri , and Indiana the system worked admirably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with fair success . But for the most part the state-chartered private banks were not supervised at all and were a danger to the economic and political stability of the country . The worst of them , mostly in the West , were known as " wildcat banks , " because in order to make the presentation of their notes for redemption as hard as possible they settled in the most inaccessible spots ? out among the wildcats . With little specie , with capital based on promissory notes , with loans based on land speculation , they nevertheless issued " money , " and many people were so unfortunate as to have their wages or their bills paid in such " money . " In 1863 and 1864 , under pressure from the exasperated business community , Congress passed acts " to provide a national currency , secured by a pledge of United States stocks , and to provide for the circulation and redemption thereof . " Banks which were organized under the safeguards of these acts were subject to federal supervision . They might issue notes secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last the nation would have a circulating medium with some stability . In 1865 , Congress imposed a tax of ten per cent on the circulation of state bank notes , thus driving the majority of sound banks to take national charters and subject themselves to federal control . By 1913 , when the Federal Reserve Act superseded the Act of 1864 , 7509 national banks carried on most of America 's commercial banking business . The national banking system , however , had one serious flaw which remained uncorrected ? perhaps because the new masters at Washington profited thereby . The system was supposed to distribute bank-note circulation with reference to need ; yet a few years after the war Woonsocket , Rhode Island , had more national circulation than North and South Carolina , Mississippi and Arkansas ; Waterville , Maine , had nearly as much as Alabama . . The per capita figures are just as astonishing . Rhode Island had $77.16 for each inhabitant , Arkansas had 13 cents . . . . Not a single southern state had obtained , by October , 1869 , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apportioned according to existing banking capital , wealth , and resources . Louisiana was entitled to $7,200,000 on this basis , and received $1,094 , - 589 ; Georgia was entitled to $4,470,000 and received $1,234,100 ; South Carolina was entitled to $4,185,000 and received $192,500.4  | These figures are a forecast of the chief domestic issue in America from the Civil War to the time of Franklin Roosevelt : the issue of economic colonialism . How can the provinces ? especially the South and West ? save themselves from what is popularly known as " Wall Street " ? Reconstruction is but a phase of this issue ; Populism springs from it , and Bryanism , and the trust-busting talk of Theodore Roosevelt , and such distortions of the American dream as Huey Long and Senator Bilbo , and such applications of it as the New Freedom of Woodrow Wilson . The problem was stated clearly by John Taylor of Caroline in the eighteenth century ; but it did not develop its full potential danger until the Civil War had left the capitalists unchallenged at Washington . Yet in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits both among the classes and the sections , the wealth and productive power of the North had increased immensely . The Industrial Revolution had been somewhat delayed in America , partly by lack of capital , partly by the nation 's preoccupation with the troubles that led to war ; but now it was to come with a rush . Ten years after the surrender at Appomattox the North was a great industrial power and the old America of small-scale production was gone forever . The growth of the Northern munitions industry during the war had been a presage of what was about to happen . When the fighting began there were two national armories , one at Harper 's Ferry , Virginia , the other at Springfield , Massachusetts . The armory in Virginia was quickly destroyed to prevent its capture by Confederate troops ; so the Union began the war with a single armory , able to turn out about eight hundred muskets a month . During the first year , therefore , most of the Northern munitions were bought in Europe . For a time the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the War Department persuaded the state purchasing commissions to withdraw . By August , 1861 , every munitions factory in Birmingham and London , with one exception , was working to fill orders from Ohio , Massachusetts , and Connecticut . Yet by the end of that year American production had been so expanded that it could meet all the needs of the Union armies . Small-arms production at Springfield had increased from 800 a month to 10,000 , and during the second year of the war the armory produced 200,000 muskets while private contractors produced half a million . Most of this production was in the Northeast ? for example , Colt 's Armory and Sharps ' Rifle Works were at Hartford , Connecticut ; Remington was at Ilion , New York , and the Burnside Factory was at Providence , Rhode Island . At Bridesburg , Pennsylvania , the Alfred Jenks Company converted a plant for making textile machinery to the manufacture of rifles . After the first year there was never a problem of quantity in armaments ; but quality was another matter . The superiority of breechloading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to give up the old muzzleloading muskets . Not until the war was in its final stages did the North begin to make breechloaders , and then only in small numbers . The war was chiefly a battle between infantrymen . More than four million muskets were issued to the Union armies , and only 7892 cannon . The largest supplier of heavy ordnance was the Fort Pitt Foundry at Pittsburgh . Inevitably the production of iron was greatly increased , Cleveland and Buffalo being the chief manufacturing centers . And while the North was discovering its industrial strength and learning to produce on a giant scale , the South had to depend largely on captured arms and on foreign purchases run through the blockade . The Confederacy began the war with one foundry that could cast cannon and one small powder mill , and although it built new arsenals and mills it was never able to come measurably close to supplying its own needs . At the end of the war its small industrial plant was in ruins , whereas the North was getting ready to challenge England as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended , the ancient rivalry between the Congress and the Executive was acute . For four years the President had gone his own way , appealing to Congress from time to time to validate his acts . Reluctantly , and often very slowly , the Congress had done what it was told . In the case of the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus , the President or the officials acting under his order might have been subject to heavy damage suits if the courts had ultimately decided that the suspension was illegal . Yet it was March , 1863 , before Congress could bring itself to agree on a bill which protected the Executive and gave him permission to continue what he had so long been doing. * Lincoln , as we have seen , was glad that the Confederacy collapsed at a time when Congress was in recess ; but his pleasure was not shared by the Congressmen . They felt they had been unimportant long enough . To be sure , the Committee on the Conduct of the War had been able by enormous effort to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good generals , and to upset a few useful plans . But for the rest Congress had been powerless to make policy during four years . It had no intention of remaining powerless . Furthermore , the discordant groups which composed footnote * Lincoln derived what he called his " war power " from two clauses in the Constitution : that which made him Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces , and that which declared it was his duty " to take care that the laws be faithfully executed . " ( Cp . Article II , Sections 2 and 3 . ) Putting these two clauses together , it seemed to him he had the power to do whatever was necessary to win a civil war .
