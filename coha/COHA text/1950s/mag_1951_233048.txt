According to legend , the Navajo Indians learned art from their gods . The gods painted lasting pictures on buckskin , but they told the Navajos to make sand-paintings and destroy them as soon as they were used . Art is magic , the gods explained , and magic for mortals is a sometime thing . <P> The sand-painting on this page is one of scores that Navajo medicine men know by heart and create ( and destroy ) within a day . It is an integral part of the Navajo Night Chant , a nine-day rite which takes place soon after autumn 's first frost . Its purpose is to heal the very ill . <P> The medicine man makes the painting by trickling powdered sandstone and charcoal from his fist on to a smooth bed of sand . He works entirely by tradition , not inspiration , painting the gods precisely as they are supposed to have pictured themselves to his ancestors . <P> In this Night Chant painting , a protective rainbow encloses the picture on the North , West and South . The East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good influences come from that direction . In the center of the painting is a sacred cornstalk , growing from what the Navajos call a " Shapen Cloud . " Four benevolent Humpback deities stand at the outer edges , carrying staffs and black clouds filled with the fruits of the earth . Grouped around the cornstalk are eight gods and goddesses gathering healing pollen . On the north are the roundheaded earth gods , black and red , with white-coated , oblong-headed goddesses . On the south are blue and yellow water gods , with goddesses . Each god is laced with zigzag lightning , haloed with plumes of the red-tailed woodpecker , and armed with a bow and rattle . <P> To transfer the healing power of the gods to his patients , the medicine man must first awaken each god in his picture separately . He does it by chanting : <P> He stirs , he stirs , he stirs , he stirs . Among the lands of dawning , he stirs , he stirs ; The pollen of dawning , he stirs , he stirs . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patients sit among them for a while , absorbing their peace and power . Afterwards , a plumed wand is used to destroy the painting , starting at the center where the medicine man began it .
