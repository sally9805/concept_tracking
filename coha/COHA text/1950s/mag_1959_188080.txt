Ever since " quiz " became television 's own four-letter word , networks have sought the fix-free format-a jackpot show that could convince audiences of its incorruptibility . The trick lay in finding contestants whose honesty could not be doubted . CBS decided to try the nation 's scrub-faced youth , began a sprightly Sunday half-hour intellectual basketball game called College Bowl . <P> The game-adapted from a 1953-55 radio show-pairs two colleges , each with four-student teams . Quizmaster Allen Ludden , 41 , a sometime writer on teenage manners and morals ( Plain Talk for Men Under 21 , Plain Talk for Women Under 21 ) , fires out a " tossup " question . The team that answers first and correctly wins ten points , plus a shot at a bonus question worth 20 to 40 points . Samples : Who was the German philosopher whose name rhymed with a doughnut-shaped roll ? ( Answer : Hegel , rhymes with bagel . ) If a hostess invited the named sons of Adam and Eve and the wives of Henry VIII to a party , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives and three sons : Cain , Abel , Seth . ) <P> This week the women again outnumbered the men . A four-girl Barnard College team , led by Heritage ( " Cherry " ) White , 21 , and Phyllis Hurwitz , 17 , creamed the University of Southern California ( three males , one female ) 195 to 65 . By winning its second straight victory ( fortnight ago the girls beat Notre Dame 230 to 110 ) , Barnard nailed a spot on the next program , on April 12 ( v. the University of Minnesota ) , will stay on until defeated . The only cash prizes : $1,500 for the Barnard scholarship fund , $500 for Loser U.S.C.-both from Sponsor General Electric . Participants get no money at all . No cash , no fix . <P> What College Bowl suffers from is a sophomoric strain on the basketball analogy . A referee 's shrill whistle signals half time and the commercial . A student audience is encouraged to cheer each correct answer . After Northwestern was defeated by Georgetown a few weeks back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dean of Students James Currie McLeod . Mused McLeod : " Who knows-I may wind up like Terry Brennan . "
