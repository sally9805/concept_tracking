When the smoke cleared away after the first clash in the Senate 's civil rights battle last week , the Southerners had won a surprising victory , and the stunned civil-righters were in tactical retreat . The battle was far from over ; it was still almost certain that , after weeks of oratory and cloakroom maneuvering , the Senate would pass some kind of civil rights bill . But the Southerners were cockily confident that the bill would say much less than the Administration measures passed by the House in June . <P> Strategist and hero of the Southerners ' victory of the week was their chosen general , Georgia 's courtly bachelor , Richard <P> Brevard Russell . Before the fighting broke out , Dick Russell made up his mind to avoid , or at least postpone , the old-fashioned Southern filibuster . Instead , he set out to drain some of the blood from the bill with amendments-keeping the filibuster in reserve as a last resort . <P> Meat or Poison . Looking for weak spots , Lawyer Russell studied the four-part Administration bill with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights commission with merely investigative powers , looks comparatively harmless to Southern eyes . So does Part II , authorizing an additional Assistant Attorney General in the Justice Department . The meat ( or poison ) of the bill is in Parts III and IV , empowering the Attorney General to seek federal court injunctions to prevent interference with civil rights . While Part IV deals solely with voting rights , Part III covers voting and a lot more besides , including " equal privileges and immunities under the laws . " The scope of Part III is set forth not in the text of the bill itself but in a dusty old law that the bill refers to-a measure passed in 1871 to curb Ku Klux Klan efforts to keep Negroes from voting , serving on juries , holding public office , etc . <P> When California 's Minority Leader William Fife Knowland moved last week to bring the civil rights bill before the Senate ( a formality that usually takes only a few minutes ) , Russell &; Co. launched a heavy-artillery attack on Part III . Taking advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as primarily a right-to-vote measure , the Southerners charged that the Justice Department was trying to sneak Part III past the Congress as a sinister stowaway aboard an innocent-looking vessel . Part III , they thundered , echoing Dick Russell 's speech of a fortnight ago ( TIME , July 15 ) , was drafted by " crafty and designing " lawyers with the secret purpose of enabling Attorney General Herbert Brownell to destroy the South 's social order through enforced integration-and racial intermarriage , too , chimed in Mississippi 's James Oliver Eastland . After a while , many a conscientious Senator could no longer see the facts for the smoke .
