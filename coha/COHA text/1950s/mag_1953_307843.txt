A North American F-86D Sabre jet " broke 700 " last week : i.e. , established a new official speed record of 715.7 m.p.h. * The previous official record , also held by a Sabre jet , was 699.9 m.p.h . To turn the trick , Lieut . Colonel William Barnes , 32 , flew his Sabre jet at the most favorable spot : the hot desert that surrounds the Salton Sea in Southern California . A Sabre jet is built to fly at mach .91 , i.e. , 91% of the speed of sound . Above this speed , it runs into a sharp increase of air resistance that is called " compressibility drag rise . " Since sound moves faster at high temperature , the best place to try for speed is a hot desert . <P> The Salton Sea has another advantage : it is 236 ft. below sea level . Its air is denser , which slows an airplane a little , but this disadvantage is more than made up for by the increased thrust that a jet engine develops in denser air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes in each direction ( to average out the wind ) over a three-kilometer course marked with smoke generators . He flew with his afterburner roaring ( for maximum thrust ) at an altitude of 90 ft. ( to fly in the hottest air ) . The rules required him to fly level so that he could gain no speed out of diving , and his Sabre jet carried a simulated military load , representing rockets , radar , etc . During the tests , shortly after noon , the temperature near the ground reached 104 . In air as hot as this , the speed of sound is 797 m.p.h. ( it is 764 at 60 ) , so that theoretically the Sabre jet could have done 725.3 m.p.h . Barnes 's record ( 715.7 m.p.h. ) is only 9.6 m.p.h. less than that theoretical maximum . Said he after the flight : " It seemed about fast enough . " <P> <P> * The fastest manned aircraft are rocket planes like the Bell X-1 and the Douglas Skyrocket ( 1,238 m.p.h. ) , but these experimental jobs fly under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the oxygen-breathing engines of operational planes . Their flights do not count as official records , which must be made over a measured course close to the ground .
