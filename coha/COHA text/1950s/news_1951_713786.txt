txt President Truman castigated Republican opponents on American foreign policy tonight as men without a program of their own who sought to confuse the American people in the hopo of winning the next election . In an address before 5,301 ) Democrats attending the capital 's Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner and by radio to the rest of the nation , Mr. Truman called upon members of his : own party " to put patriotism above politics . " Largely devoted to foreign policy , including a spirited defense of the gains already achieved by our resort to arms in Korea. , the President 's speech replied sharply to many of the recent speeches and congressional votes of the Republican leadership . He was applauded thirty-one times during the talk . There were sentences which applied to former President Herbert Hoover , Senators Robert A. Taft of Ohio , and Kenneth S. Wherry of Nebraska , and House Minority Leader Joseph W. Martin Jr . of Massachusetts , although the President did not name any of them . Sees Effort at Confusion Declaring that Republican leaders had fed the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign policy at a time when they could not agree on a program of their own , Mr. Truman said they were trying to confuse the voters in order to win the next election . " They say they want a powerful defense system , second to none ? but they are against universal military training , " the President declared . " They say they want other free nations to resist aggression  --  but they do n't want us to send any troops to help . " They want us to get out of Korea  --  but they urge us to wage an aggressive war against China . " They say it will provoke Russia to attack if we send troops to Europe  --  but they are sure Russia wo n't come in if we carry the war to China . . " They say they want to crush communism  --  and yet they want us to draw back into our shell and Let the rest of the world be overrun by the Reds . " They say they are worried bemuse the Russians outnumber us  --  but they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was no mention in the iddress of the President 's spectac ? liar decision in mid-week to reieve General of the Army Douglas of all ' his Far Eastern : ommands and the uproar it proluced . Mr. Truman departed from his prepared text , however , to interpolate indirect criticism of General . " It has been categorically stated , " he declared , " that Russia will not come in if we bomb Manchuria . That statement was made to me about the Chinese not coming into Korea . And it was made on good authority , too , and I believed it . " This reference was to what General told him at their conference on Wake Island in the Pacific last year . While General was n't named , Mr. Truman had high praise for " a great American , " General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower , for his leadership of the North Atlantic armed forces . The President spoke before a partisan audience which had to make a $100-a-plate contribution in order to get a. ticket to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their gifts thus added approximately $400,000 to the Democratic national campaign fund for future electoral efforts . The President interpolated a new introduction to his speech . It made him feel good , he said , to hear such statements as had been made by earlier speakers about the responsibilities which had been placed upon him . His only wish , he said , was that he should prove worthy of such a trust . The Democrats heard from the President little about domestic policy except the assertion that their party had pioneered in the measures that provided a better life for ell of the people . As the Democratic party 's leader he reaffirmed its pledge of a " Fair Deal " for the American people , but in terms of today 's stern realities , he defined that phrase to mean that : " We all share - and share alike - the responsibilities and sacrifices of our defense program . " Repeating and expanding upon much that he had said in Wednesday night 's foreign policy speech to the nation after General had been removed , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist aggression and struck at those who criticized initial American aid to that country or who now argue that the United States should get out in order to stop the fighting . " If we got out of Korea , the Communist leaders would strike somewhere else , " the President declared . " They would strike at Japan , or the Middle East , or in Europe . And sooner or later they would go on to strike at South America , and at our own country . " The United States standin Korea , the President contended , already has had three measurable " profound effects , " including these:1 1 . . It has upset and delayed the Communist timetable of aggression against other nations . 2 . It has given the free world warning and time to rebuild its defenses. 3 . It has placed a great strain on the whole system of dictatorships , which can not survive continued reverses , with the result that " cracks are already beginning to appear in the structure of international communism . " He compared the Russians with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson was President , and he said that " now , as then , there is no room for piracy in a free world . " The Soviet leaders , he said , have abandoned any serious attempt to improve the lives of the people they control , but are using them and the resources of their countries to build " a mighty machine for war and conquest . " It is the Russian hope , he said , that they can divide the democratic nations and overthrow them one by one  --  and it is to meet this threat , that the bipartisan foreign policy built on solid alliances with other free nations and aimed at securing peace for all the world has been established and practiced . Because the United States faces a powerful and ruthless enemy , Mr. Truman declared that " the only way we can prevail * * * is for every man and woman in this country to put national interest above personal interest . " Only the President 's speech was broadcast and televised to the nation , but Vice President Alben W. Barkley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Washington dinner . Other speakers included William M. Boyle Jr. , Democratic national chairman ; Mrs. India Edwards , vice-chairman and director of the women 's division , and the two cochairmen of the dinner , John L. Sullivan , former Secretary of the Navy , and Mrs. Charles Brannan , wife of the Secretary of Agriculture . All the Cabinet members were introduced , but only one received's. standing ovation . That was Dean Adheson , the Secretary of State , ' who has been criticized most by . Republicans . His removal has been demanded formally in resolutions passed by Republican conferences of the House and Senate . - Mrs. Edwards made a reference to the removal of General . She was applauded wildly when she , said that the President would not allow any military commander to take action that might extend the war . The Vice President 's speech came close to public criticism of Mr. Truman for some of the hasty letters . he has written and things he has said under strain of world crisis , but he reaffirmed his confidence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Boyle emphasized the same theme as the President  --  the need for national unity in a time of world danger  --  but he accused " some members " of the Republican party of resorting to " abuse , slander , smears and lies . in order to further their own selfish purposes . " Mr. Truman , he ? said , like Andrew Jackson , Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt before him , " has had to endure the attacks of the powerful interests who ? use devious and underhanded means designed to mislead and confuse the American public . "
