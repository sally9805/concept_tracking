grt F r years it was an open question in the athletic world whether Bob Kiphuth could swim . Since the Yale team he coached was accumulating the longest string of victories in the history of swimming , the question got more provocative every year . Everyone knew Kiphuth could teach others to swim like startled trout , but no one could be sure whether he himself could even tread water . A few years ago , at the spectacular annual Swimming Carnival at Yale , Kiphuth at last took the plunge . In sight of several thousand spectators , he entered the pool and set off across it in a strange but workable version of the Australian crawl , emerging safely on the other side . None of his pupils would have been surprised if he had sunk like a stone . Moving through the water is almost an afterthought in Kiphuth 's conception of swimming . Most of his basic coaching is done on dry land , ' before his swimmers touch the water . You feel during this period of training that the aim is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America candidate . Later , of course , when he leads you to the pool and tells you to swim a half mile with your ankles tied together , you know you 're supposed to be a swimmer . I swam for Kiphuth during my first two years at Yale , just after World War II , as a respectable , middling member of this squad of stars . Records were being broken all around mc , and shortly before I retired from swimming I broke one myself  --  a world record at that . Of course , it was an unimportant record , the one-mile free-style relay , and there were seventeen others who broke it with inc . But I did break it . This athletic career began a few days after I enrolled , when Kiphuth summoned me to his office . 1 found him sitting amid confusion and Currier and Ives sporting prints , wearing a pair of shorts . With him was Alan Ford , the great Yale free-styler who had just broken Johnny Weissmuller 's world record for the 100-yard dash . I said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kiphuth immediately launched into a discussion of " body building , " which seemed off the point to mc . " Throw medicine balls ! " he shouted . This baffled me , but finally , slowly , it became clear that a long time would pass before I reached the pool . Kiphuth led Ford and me down stairways and along corridors , told us to undress and took us into the steam room . I gave up any attempt to speak and concentrated on trying to breathe . ' Put a towel over your mouth , " ordered Kiphuth . Filtering the steam solved the problem of breathing , but with my mouth full of Turkish towel I could n't say a word . That did n't matter . Kiphuth talked , his short , tough-muscled body hunched on a bench , his big head floating in clouds of steam . Finally I took the towel out of my mouth for a moment and asked , " Do you think ssvinitners are born or made , Mr. Kiphuth ? " ( The " Mr. Kiphuth " was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) He looked at inc with his level gaze for a while and then turned to Ford . " Stand up , Alan , " he said . Ford stood up . " Would you say he was born or made ? " Kiphuth asked . I pulled the towel out , murmured " Both " and thrust it hastily back in . Ford looked as close to being a human fish as anyone I had ever seen . His legs tapered down from powerful thighs to " overextended " knees  --  knees which bend a little in the opposite direction from the joint ? then past strong calves to ankles which had plenty of play . Legs like these ? undulating pistons of prover  --  gave him a tremendous thrust in the water . Kiphuth agreed chat the legs were good . So were the arms , But it was the trunk which made the difference . " The real strength , " he said , " the great mover in all physical exertion , is in the big trunk muscles . Alan 's got his long back muscles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what really counts . " He looked at my not-so-big trunk muscles and exclaimed , " Body building ! " Of course , most of all you 've got to have the will to be a great swimmer , " he went on . " I 've seen a lot of big boys with all the muscles but they did n't get far because they did n't have the will power . " I felt that he was sizing up my own will power , and frowned determinedly over the top of the towel . The steam had been thickening all this time , and for me , who had never been in a steam bath before , the heat was now unbelievable . Kiphuth and Ford chatted affably , as though they found 200 degrees or whatever it was  --  a comfortable temperature . Rather than stagger for the door , I opened my mouth , gasped in a searing jet of steam and whispered hoarsely that it got pretty hot in steam baths , did n't it ? " Get into the steam-bath habit , " Kiphuth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like them ; just people with no guts . " 1 sank back and prepared myself for incineration . But nothing really escapes Kiphuth 's notice about his boys , so a few searing minutes later he grunted , " This might be enough for your first time . Go out and lie down , " I made my way groggily to the door and managed to reach a cooler anteroom . There was a kind of mortuary slab , and I laid myself out on it . A faucet let cool drops of water fall on me . After a while , Kiphuth and Ford came out and we went to get dressed . I expected that Kiphuth , as a coach , would wear clothes which looked beat-up from having ben thrown into lockers and yanked out several times a day . Instead , he attired himself like a Wall Street banker . His suit was a discreetly patterned gray , the shirt looked custom-made , the tie had a courtly design . Later I found that he sometimes dressed like an Ivy League student , with bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flannel slacks . But he never dressed like a coach . A few days later body building began . We gathered in a white-walled basketball court halfway up one of the major towers of the Yale campus , the Payne Whitney Gymnasium . Ford and a few other stars were on exhibit at the front of the room , and the group dwindled back through well-known returning men to us unknowns at the back . Kiphuth strode among us , calling out the exercises in his deep voice and keeping time by banging a long pole on the floor . Sometimes he reached out with the pole to crack someone on the rump who was holding it too high during push-ups . Sometimes he threw a huge medicine ball at a would-be swimmer , who had to catch it . high over his head . Another boy sat across the catcher 's knees to keep him from going over like a tenpin . Staying upright while you catch a Kiphuththrown medicine ball gives the big trunk muscles the workout of all time . " How do you feel ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session was breaking up . " Tight as a drum , " I said . " You 'll get over that . There may be some tightness at first , but some of the other exercises will loosen you up . You have to be loose to swim , of course . Strong but loose . A swimmer 's training is different from some other sports . " I said that I was beginning to realize that , and wondered if being in good condition for swimming would n't be a drawback in playing other sports . Tennis , for instance . " Tennis ! " It was as though I had suggested rolling hoops . " What the devil can tennis do for you ? " I thought of the different things tennis could do for me , but before I could mention them , Kiphuth went on . He did n't have anything definite against tennis , I gathered , but the point was that " it could n't basically do anything for you . " Baseball and golf were ticked off in the same way . Polo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sneer . No , it was swimming which was the " real sport , " despite its lack of headlines , glamour and fans . Most other recreation did little for the trunk muscles , and it was when they were weak that people developed paunches and sagging shoulders . " You can play all the tennis you want , " he said , " and it wo n't overcome the way gravity pulls on your posture , stretching and sagging the stomach muscles , hollowing the lower back , hunching the upper back and flattening the chest . There 's only one way to keep from looking like a sack . Build up the trunk muscles by direct attack . " Then he doubled up his formidable fist and delivered a direct attack on my stomach , with a loud laugh . " Like that ! You wo n't even feel that in a few weeks . " Stomach muscles fascinated Kiphuth . He always expressed his pleasure with them in this way  --  a blow with his fist . This meant more approval , I found out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many punches later , we at last went into the water . The first day we waited Kiphuth 's Ten Rules for Keeping Fit In his book , How To Be Fit , Yale swimming coach Bob Kiphuth recommends the following key exercises , to be repeated ten to twenty times each morning , John Fleming , a member of Kiphuth 's present team , shows how to do them . for Kiphuth in the office of the Exhibition Pool , those of us who had n't swum under him wondering what kind of ordeal this was going to be . The top swimmers stood around in relaxed postures. looking as hard and muscular as Michelangelo statues . Then one of them would shake himself in a way swimmers do , executing a kind of wiggle from wrists to ankles to make sure that everything was loose . Kiphuth came in , chuckled , peered at us over the tops of thick-lensed spectacles and said resonantly . " All right , let 's go . " We were divided into groups of six , and then we began to swim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding oblong wooden dotter-boards in front of us . Our ankles were bound together , and we pulled more lengths using only our arms , and , of course . the big trunk muscles . We swam more lengths breathing every third stroke instead of every second , which is like requiring a right-handed golfer to make every other swing left-handed . Rubber kick-fins were put on our feet , which made us shoot through the water very fast . Kiphuth , stripped to a pair of shorts , marched around the pool , ready to poke us with his pole as we swam by if he sawsomething to correct , driving relentlessly for top conditioning . After the first couple of weeks he was no longer tolerant with laggards . One day a swimmer caught a cramp in his calf . He began to wallow around painfully . struggling to reach the " shallow " end of the pool . Water there was seven feet deep . A few people on the sides started forward to help him , but not Kiphuth . I le glared at this writhing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he growled . - There you 've got what happens to people who do n't train . A cramp ! " The swimmer finally grasped the wall and pulled himself out . He got no sympathy from Kiphuth , no pat on the shoulder , not even a punch in the stomach . Ile got a leg massage , and that was all . A short time later he dropped out of swimming , unable to hold the pace . Kiphuth has ncscr cut anyone from his squads ; this is the way they go . When the winter season arrived and meets began , another side of Kiphuth emerged  --  the public one . At meets lie was calm , even retiring . He chose carefully the swimmers he was entering , sent them in without pep talks and awaited the outcome . Nothing upset him . Our Yale team 's hardest meet that year was against ( Continued from Pagr 891 West Paint . We were paced toward it , and Kiphuth was bent on winning . When we began to trail he never turned a hair . Except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been taken for a bystander . The decision went to the final event , the 400-yard free-style relay . Kiphuth entered his four best sprinters , with Alan Ford swimming last . The first Army man got a slight lead . The second increased it a little . The third increased it a little more . By the time Ford was free to spring into the race , the Army man had a lead of ten yards . The rest of us stood behind the finish line and roared . Kiphuth seemed to have disappeared . Then , as Ford shot toward the finish , steadily closing the gap , Kiphuth , who had been lurking quietly in the background , charged past me . He had held himself under tight control until that last crucial instant , but now he wanted to see the finish . Although Ford unofficially swam 100 yards faster than anyone else ever had , he lost the race by inches . It was the first Yale swimming defeat in five years . No one who knew Kiphuth 's will to win could doubt his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion at all . In fact , there was only one thing to indicate how he felt . In the bus going back to Nev . Haven he lit a cigarette . The rest of us stared in awe . Kiphuth neither smokes nor drinks . But he lit this cigarette and puffed amateurishly on it for a while , without inhaling . Up in its smoke went this loss to West Point . And lie has n't had another defeat  --  and almost certainly not another cigarette  --  from then to this writing . Kiphuth is famous for this lack of enthusiasm for losing . When he took over Yale swimming in 1918 , the team had had a respectable but spotty record . It immediately launched into a six-year winning streak . The streak was finally broken in 1924. but a more glittering one began which did n't end until 1937 , when Harvard stunned the Yale campus , and the Harvard campus , by winning . Then followed three dank seasons in which , out of forty meets , Yale lost five , recovering in 1940 to proceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to West Point . Is it true that Kiphuth schedules only easy teams to preserve this fabulous record ? Along with other Yale teams , the swimming team schedules its thirteen or fourteen dual meets almost entirely with Eastern colleges . As it happens , these teams are n't usually very good . so that Yale goes on winning . It 's not so much discretion as distance which keeps Kiphuth from scheduling powerful squads like Ohio State or Michigan . But he meets them in the national tournaments , and frequently has to surrender the national championship to one or the other . In 1938 , he gave in to publicized demands by coach Malty Mann , of the University of Michigan , for a dual meet and lost by a hairbreadth . Michigan licked Yale again in 1939 and 1940 . These defeats were avenged at a return meet in 1942 , when the Yale swimmers went out to Ann Arbor and obliterated Michigan . taking every first place to win , 59 to 16 . This squad went on to collect the Eastern , National and A.A.U. championships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yale 's is the greatest swimming team that has ever been gathered together , and much stronger than any of our previous Olympic learns . " But that was in 1942 ; Kiphuth has had better teams since . For someone who was going to revolutionize competitive swimming , Kiphuth showed little promise in his early life . When he was born and christened Robert John Herman Kiphuth in Tonawanda , New York , in 1890. none of his family was notable in sports . He came to Yale in 1914 , equipped with only a high-school diploma and some summer courses in physical education . For the first three years he instructed obscurely in physical education . Then , one day in 1917 , the swimmingcaptain approached him . Could Mr. Kiphuth suggest anything to improve the team 's form ? The answer was hesitant at first , since Kiphuth had had little training and less experience with swimming . He thought the boys should do some calisthenics . Swimmers never did calisthenics , since it might tighten them up , but Kiphuth thought they should try . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it definitely helped ; soon everybody on the team was doing it , and the great winning streak was launched . The equipment for Yale swimming improved as dramatically as its record under Kiphuth . During his first years . the pool and other sports facilities were centered in the Carnegie Gymnasium . This place would look like a tool shed beside the present Payne Whitney Gymnasium , which has been called the finest gym in the world . It 's all in Bob Kiphuth 's charge . There is equipment for every kind of college sport  --  a rowing tank , a rifle range , a golf room , and furnishings for two Kiphuth preoccupations ; body building and posture . Besides a fifty-five-yard practice pool , there is a splendid exhibition pool , which scats 2000 spectators-3000 in a pinch . Smoking by anyone is forbidden . From this great Gothic gym Kiphuth 's influence has radiated around the world . The United States Olympic Committee brought him into international sports by naming him coach of the women 's Olympic swimming team in 1928 , and of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so securely that muttering arose among other American coaches . " Why do n't they ever choose someone else , like me ? " one coach asked in print after Kiphuth had been named for the third time . One answer is that no coach 's success matched Kiphuth 's , Another reason may be that Kiphuth is a cultured man . At the Olympics , a swimming coach who could chat about English first editions or Japanese theater did no harm to American prestige . He drove his Olympic learns , and himself , very hard . During tryouts in Providence , Rhode Island , for the 1936 games , he developed a high reser , but refused to pause for treatment . On board the ship to Europe , seized with severe pains , he went on supervising practice in the ship 's pool , Despite his illness , he carried full responsibility for the learn , which won two of the six first places . Only after returning to New Haven did he accept the fact that he had a case of sireptococseic fever severe enough It , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postwar revival of the Olympics in London in 1948 , Kiphuth engineered his greatest success . The United States swept the men 's swimming events , the first time any nation had accomplished this in the history of the modern games . It was his last appearance as Olympic coach . He remains a great supporter of the Olympics as " the best force for international understanding we have , " and he emphatically favors the participation of the Russians . The Olympics arc for amateurs only . Although Soviet athletes have a status that looks rather professional , Kiphuth feels this can not be held against them now . " We knew when the Russians were admitted to the Olympics what form of economic structure they had , " he said recently . " The Russians have n't changed . After inviting them in , are we going to kick them in the teeth ? They could quote chapter and verse to us on the way some of our athletes are subsidized  --  on athletic scholarships , for example . " On home ground he is outspokenly in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional profit out of their skill , but line swimmers are drawn there because they want to swim under Kiphuth , even if they live in Panama , as Alan Ford did , or in Australia , the home of the great distance swimmer , John Marshall . Others come unknown to Yale , and have all their development under Kip'loth . Allan Stack was nothing special when he entered Yale in 1945 , just another backstrokcr . His first year made no headlines . In the second year his time for ISO yards improved by eighteen seconds , and he won the Outdoor A.A.U. title . The third year he shot to the top by winning the national collegiate championship . and then in London capturing the Olympic gold medal for the United States . In 1946 Kiphuth was named athletic director of Yule . He accepted on condi tion that he could continue to coach swimming . But in 1949 , during a handball game , he had a heart attack . One of his jobs had to go . Of course , he stuck to swimming and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his only child , Dc Laney Kiphuth , Yale ' 41 . Since the death of his wife in 1941 , Kiphuth has moved into a suite in one of the residential colleges at Yale , filling the rooms with his extensive collection of rare first editions . At sixty-five , he appears as tough-muscled and resilient as ever . His sn'runoNv EverriNo POST hair is thin and nearly white , but still worn in a belligerent crew cut . Kiphuth 's highest loyalty is to Yale , where he is one of the best-known figures on the campus . A department was set up three years ago , under Kiphuth , to train physical-education teachers . The aim is to produce men in athletics who have intellectual breadth and a wide understanding of the world beyond sports . It is an interesting experiment ; if the course prospers , it might one day manage to produce another Bob Kiphuth.
