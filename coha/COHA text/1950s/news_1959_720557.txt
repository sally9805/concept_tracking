txt At the end of my long trip through the Soviet Union , covering about 17,000 miles , I have had two extensive discussions with Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev . He revealed with un- ' mistakable clarity his complete confidence that the Soviet Union can within relatively few years gain supremacy over the United States . " We will demonstrate the advantages of our system and set an example to other countries which they will follow , " he said to me . Basis of Confidence Cited The grounds far Mr. Khrushchev 's confidence , he made clear to me , are threefold . First , he has supreme faith in Marxism . Communism , he believes , is a higher form of human organization and eventually capitalism must cede to it . Second , he is certain that the Soviet economy will makes long strides in catching up with us , especially in heavy industry , during the current Seven-Year Plan . Third , he is deeply ignorant of the facts of American life and its potentialities . Stalin , he acknowledged , laid the foundations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , not until his death was it possible to take the initiative and release the energies essential to that progress . " In Stalin 's later days , " Khrushchev told me , " he became overbearing and distrustful of his colleagues . He would not let us do the work he was no longer capable of . He did not always use his great authority for proper purposes . It was very ' difficult for us . " I suggested that we had had similar difficulties with Stalin in foreign affairs and Khrushchev readily agreed . In fact , in international affairs , Khrushchev said repeatedly , " Stalin was not blameless . " I went on to point out that Khrushchev , had recently stated publicly that I had made a number of anti-Soviet speeches and I suggested that he had made even more anti-American ones . To this he also agreed . I asked whom Stalin had chosen to succeed him . Khrushchev replied a little sourly : " He never selected anyone . He thought he would live forever . " Then he revealed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of Stalin 's last days . " One Saturday in March of 1953 we all went as usual to Stalin 's dacha tvilla for dinner , " he said . " He was in fine spirits and we had a good time . Then we went home . Next day we waited for the telephone call Stalin usually put through to us on Sundays , but it never came . On Monday evening the head of his bodyguard called us to say Stalin was unwell . " Berta , Bulganin , Malenkov and myself hurried out to his dacha and found him unconcious . A blood clot had paralyzed an arm , a leg and his tongue . We stayed with him for three days , but he remained unconscious . Then for a moment he came out of his coma and tried to joke with us . Pointing to a painting over his bed of a baby lamb being fed with a spoon by a little girl , he indicated by gestures that now he was as helpless as the lamb . " A few minutes later he died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , we were all hisl pupils and deeply indebted to him . Like Peter the Great he fought barbarism with barbarism , but he was a great man . " Premier the Driving Force Khrushchev left no doubt in my mind that he is the driving power behind both the industrial and agricultural expansion which is taking place wherever I have been in the Soviet Union . At the end of the war , Stalin had told me of his plans for industrial expansion including 60,000,000 tons of steel a year . Then Soviet production had been reduced to 12,000,000 tons and I thought this goal could not be reached for many decades . But already , only fourteen years later , it is 55,000,000 tons and in Karaganda ' alone I had seen another 3,200,000-ton plant coming into operation . In northern Kazakhstan I had watched Soviet engineers uncovering iron mines with a total annual capacity of 80,000,000 tons . But , Khrushchev told me the Soviet Union is presently exploiting only half its potential . I asked whether he had the manpower to carry out his ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he - replied , adding , however , that much of it is at present tied down by unproductive practices in agriculture . " Some of our collective farms are using two and even three times more workers than they should , " he acknowledged , " We shall take them away when we need them to work in industry . " I had no doubt that he had the power to do so . Earlier he had admitted to me that his word is law in the Soviet Union . He was equally confident that the Soviet food problem was being solved . I had myself seen the virgin lands which he is plowing up and sowing to grain . I pointed out that even some Soviet scientists were afraid that plowing up the steppe would create another dust bowl . " Despite two severe droughts , " he replied , " the project has already paid for itself and we have made a profit of nearly $2,000,000,000 . " Besides , he continued , the area is producing the cheapest grain in the entire country . " The skeptics are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Output Stressed Nor is the power to electrify the farms and drive his industry worrying him . From the Volga River to deep in Siberia I had seen huge hydroelectric plants rising . New coal and gas deposits , he told me , had opened the possibility of much cheaper thermal power stations , which he now proposes to build . " By 1970 , " he said , " we shall be within 70 per cent of America 's 1957 power output . " With his great plans to " catch up with America , " I asked him if he was not underestimating the United States ' capacity to expand . His economists had told me , they calculated American economic growth at only 2 per cent , which is hardly more than its population increase . If this was the best information he was getting , I suggested he fire his economists and hire someone who knew the American economy better and could report more accurately what was taking place there free of dogmatic prejudices . Far froffi the stagnation which his economists predicted , I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . " Anastas I. ** First Deputy Premier , had now joined the discussion and together he and Khrushchev stubbornly supported their economists ' findings . Though the American democratic system was still far from its end , Mr. Khrushchev said , it was inevitably heading in that direction . He charged that American prosperity was due largely to profits made during both World Wars . But when I explained the absurdity of such statements , it seemed to make little impression on him . " You have become so rich that until now you have been able to bribe or buy off your workers with high pay and living standards , " he said . But , he added , " one day they , too , will overthrow your capitalist system . " As he described the inevitable triumph of communism , Mr. Khrushchev talked forcefully , leaning forward and wagging his forefinger under my chin . His small , piercing eyes peered intently at me and his round cheeks were flushed with - emotion . As he grew more intense , he spoke with a marked Ukrainian accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In five to seven years , we will be stronger than you , " he said . " We developed the hydrogen bomb before you . We have intercontinental missiles and our rockets carry warheads many times larger than yours . " I interrupted to tell him that this sort of talk hardly allayed American fears of Soviet aggressive intentions . He replied that Americans had misunderstood Communist doctrine on the possibility of war. , Earlier doctrine , he explained , had defined imperialistic war as inevitable . However , he continued , the twentieth Soviet Communist Party Congress had revised the dogma and declared such wars to be avoidable , though not impossible . Furthermore , he added , the twenty-first Party Congress had confirmed this view . Thus war is no longer necessary . He seemed to think that we should accept without question the decrees of party congresses as predetermining our future history . Toward the end of our long discussions , Khrushchev brought up the Berlin problem and reiterated in the most forceful language the Soviet position as stated at Geneva . I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties were solidly behind the President in his stand to protect the freedom of the 2,000,000 people living in West Berlin . Nevertheless , he appears to be so confident of his strength that he is determined to force a solution of the problem . Furthermore , in the long run , he is firmly convinced , the Communist system will prevail throughout the world and that we are on the way out . This is the challenge we face .
