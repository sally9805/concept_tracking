txt An uproar over questions about Dr. Samuel H. Sheppard 's extra-marital romances , particularly with his former laboratory technician , Susan Hayes , ' climaxed today 's jury selection efforts at his trial for the murder of his pregnant wife . " we 're ' not trying anyone for any sex offense here , " Judge Edward Blythin interjected at the height of the argument . " 0 , yes , we are , " roared Chief Defense Counsel William J. Corrigan . The prosecution has indicat ? ed it will attempt to prove that the motive in the July 4 blud ? geoning of Mrs. Sheppard was the desire of her handsome and athletic young husband for freedom from his marital vows of faithfulness . May Take a Week Two jurors were tentatively seated in this second day of the task both sides have estimated may take a week to 10 days . One was tentatively accepted yesterday .

He asked Mrs. Borke if she knew or ever had heard of Susan Hayes and , wheh she replied no , he continued : ' " It may develop during this trial that testimony in this case may divulge that Sam Sheppard may have had affairs with other women besides his wife . " Fails to Upset Baling The state o b j e c t e d , and Judge Blythin sustained the objection , when Garmone started to ask Mrs. Borne if such evidence would prejudice her against the defendant . The attorney unsuccessfully tried to change the judge 's mind . Similar questioning was renewed during interrogation of the day 's second accepted juror , Edmund L. Verlinger , 29 , a hardware store manager . Corrigan asked him if he had heard of Susan and , when he said he had , the attorney asked if he would be prejudiced by evidence that the defendant had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sustained . The chief defense attorney turned angrily toward the judge and exclaimed : " I know the state 's main case is to bring In the testimony of Susan Hayes concerning extra-marital relations of Dr. Sheppard . " " State 's Star Witness " ? " What if the state does n't bring it in ? " asked ? Judge 13-Whin . " Susan Hayes is their star witness , " Corrigan replied . " Am I going to be forced to accept a person on this jury whose ideas on sex are strong ? Such a person would be prejudiced against the defendant . This subject to some people is very strong . Some people consider sex affairs or deviations worse than murder . " ? Turning toward the crowd of news representatives who filled almost all of the seats in the little courtroom , Corrigan demanded : " What do you suppose all these reporters are here for ?

" Prosecutors leaped to their feet with objections and said the defense attorney might prejudice the jurors already accepted . Corrigan told them , " Let 's not get excited . " Called " Heart " of Case When Judge Blythin asserted that the trial was not for a sex offense , Corrigan insisted that it was and added : " You clearly are , shutting me off from a very important matter in this case . " He called Miss Hayes ' testimony the " heart " of the case . " Let 's get back to basic principles , " Judge Blythin said . " Did Sam Sheppard murder Marilyn Sheppard ? That 's the main question . Let 's keep our eye on the bull 's eye . " Altho Corrigan continued arguing for some time , the judge stood firm against questioning veniremen about their attitude toward Dr. Sheppard 's romances . He told the defense attorney : " The court is satisfied it is not a proper line of inquiry here at this time . " Defendant Fidgets Dr. Sheppard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation Ins evoked repeated comments , fidgeted during the heated argument over his affairs with other women . But he appeared somewhat bored by the routine questioning of prospective jurors . He spent much of his time reading a paper backed booklet given him by his mother .

" Defense counsel , who has contended Dr. Sheppard ca n't get a fair trial in this area because of prejudice built tip against him , delved in great detail into the backgrounds of each venireman . But the prolonged questioning has thus far failed to divulge the overwhelming prejudice the defense has claimed . A defense motion to move the trial elsewhere on the ground that an impartial jury can not be obtained here is held in abeyance by the judge who ordered counsel to go ahead and see if they could get a fair jury . Corrigan renewed that motion today but the judge turned it aside as he had yesterday .                    @
