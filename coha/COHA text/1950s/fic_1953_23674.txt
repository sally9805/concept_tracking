A Christmas Carillon A Story by Hortense-Calisher Drawings by Peter Takel ROUT four weeks before Christmas , Gror-ley , in combined shame and panic , began to angle for an invitation to somewhere , anywhere , for Christmas Day . By this time , after six months of living alone in the little Waverly Place flat to which he had gone as soon as he and his wife had decided to separate , he had become all too well re-acquainted with his own peculiar mechanism in regard to solitude . It was a mechanism that had its roots in the jumbled lack of privacy of an adolescence spent in the dark , tour-room apartment to which his parents had removed themselves and three children after his father 's bankruptcy in ' 29 . Prior to that , Grorley 's childhood had been what was now commonly referred to as Edwardian  --  in a house where servants and food smells kept their distance until needed , and there were no neurotic social concerns about the abundance of either ? a house where there was always plush under the buttocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lace on the pillow , and above all that general expectancy of creature comfort and spiritual order which novelists now relegated to the days before 1914 . That it had lasted considerably later , Grorley knew , since this had been the year of his own birth , but although he had been fifteen when they had moved , it was the substantial years before that had faded to fantasy . Even now , when he read or said the word " reality , " his mind reverted to Sunday mid-days in the apartment house living room , where the smudgy daylight was always diluted by lamps , the cheaply stippled walls menaced the oversized furniture , and hc , his father and brother and sister , each a claustrophobe island of irritation , were a constant menace to one another . Only his mother , struggling alone in the kitchen with the conventions of roast chicken and gravy , had perhaps achieved something of the solitude they all had craved . To Grorley even now , the smell of roasting fowl was the smell of a special kind of Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then too it had been in the Village , not far from where he presently was . After his graduation from City College he had worked a year , to save up for a master 's in journalism , and then , salving his conscience with the thought that he had at least paid board at home for that period , he had left his family forever . The following year , dividing his time between small-time newspaper job and classes , living in his $27 per month place off Morton Street , he had savored all the wonders of the single doorkey opening on the quiet room , of the mulled book and the purring clock , of the smug decision not to answer the phone and let even the most delightful invader in . Now that he looked back on it , of course , he recalled that the room had rung pretty steadily with the voices of many such who had been admitted , but half the pleasure had been because it had been at his own behest . That had been a happy time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bachelor-style on the edge of society , dipping inward when he chose . Of all the habitations he had had since , that had been the one whose conformations he remembered best , down to the last , worn dimple of brick . When he had house-hunted , last June , lie had returned instinctively to the neighborhood of that time . Only a practicality born of superstition had kept him from hunting up the very street , the very house . H E HAD had over two years of his free- dom , although the last third of it had been rather obscured by his courtship of Eunice . Among the girl students of the Village there had been quite a few who , although they dressed like ballerinas and prattled of art like painters ' mistresses , drew both their incomes and their morality from good , solid middle-class families back home . Eunice had been the prettiest and most sought after of these , and part of her attraction for some , and certainly for Grorley , had been that she seemed to be , quite honestly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomarry and settle down . Grorley had been so entranced at finding like feelings in a girl  --  and in such a beautiful one  --  that he had quite forgotten that in coaxing her out of her " freedom " he was persuading himself out of his own . He had not realized this with any force until the children came , two within the first four years of the marriage . Before that , in the first fusion of love , it had seemed to Grorley that two could indeed live more delightfully alone than one , and added to this had been that wonderful release from jealousy which requited love brings  --  half the great comfort of the loved one 's presence being that , ipso facto , she is with no one else . During this period of happy , though enlarged privacy , Grorley confided to Eunice some , though not all , of his feelings about family life and solitude . He was , lie told her , the kind of person who needed to be alone a great deal  --  although this of course excepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holidays frowsting in the house like the rest of the world , sitting there stuffed and droning , with murder in their hearts . They must always have plans laid well in advance , plans which would keep the two of them emotionally limber , so to speak , and en Mein air . Since these plans were always pleasant  --  tickets to the Philharmonic , with after-theater suppers , hikes along the Palisades , fishing expeditions to little-known ponds back of the Westchester parkways , whose intricacies Grorley , out of a history of Sunday afternoons , knew as well as certain guides knew Boca Raton  --  Eunice was quite willing to accede . In time she grew very tactful , almost smug , over Grorley 's little idiosyncrasy , and he sometimes heard her on the phone , fending people off . " Not Sunday . Gordon and I have a thing about holidays , you know . " By this time , too , they had both decided that , although Grorley would keep his now very respectable desk job at the paper , his real destiny was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected " imagination " as only the unimaginative can , Grorley 's foible was the very proper defect of a noble intelligence . But with the corning of the children , it was brought home to Grorlcy that he was face to face with one of those major rearrangements of existence for which mere tact would not suffice . Eunice , during her first pregnancy , was as natural and unassuming about it as a man could wish ; she went on their Sunday sorties to the very last , and maintained their gallant privacy right up to the door of the delivery room . But the child of so natural a mother was bound to be natural too . It contracted odd fevers whenever it wished , and Frequently on Sundays became passionately endeared to their most expensive sitter , or would have none at all , and in general permeated their lives as only the most powerfully frail of responsibilities can . And when the second one arrived , it did so , it seemed to Grorley , only to egg the other one on . There came a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Grorley , sitting in the odor of baked meat , first admitted that his hydra-headed privacy was no longer a privacy at all . He had created , he saw , his own monster ; sex and the devil had had their sport with him , and he was , in a sense that no mere woman would understand , all too heavily " in the family way . " Looking at Eunice , still neat , still very pretty , but with her lovely mouth pursed with maternity , her gaze sharp enough for Kinder and Kiiche , but abstract apparently for him , he saw that she had gone over to the enemy and was no longer his . Eunice had become ? " the family " too . I T WAS as a direct consequence of this that Grorley wrote the book which was his making . Right after that fatal morning , he had engaged a room in a cheap downtown hotel ( he and Eunice . were living out in Astoria at the time ) , with the intention , as he explained to Eunice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coming home weekends . Ile had also warned her that , because of the abrasive effects of family life , it would probably be quite some time before " the springs of reverie -- a phrase he had lifted from Ellen Glasgow  --  would start churning . His real intention was , of course , to prowl , and for some weeks thereafter he joined the company of those men who could be found , night after night , in places where they could enjoy the freedom of not having gone home where they belonged . To his surprise , he found , all too quickly , that though his intentions were of the worst , he had somehow lost the moral force to pursue them . He had never been much for continuous strong drink , and that crude savoirfaire which was needed for the preliminaries to lechery seemed to have grown creaky with the years . He took to spending odd hours in the newspaper morgue , correlating , in a halfhearted way , certain current affairs that interested him . After some months , he suddenly realized that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publisher almost immediately . Since he was much more a child of his period than he knew , he had hit upon exactly that note between disaffection and hope which met response in the breasts of those who regarded themselves as permanent political independents . His book was an instant success with those who thought of themselves as thinking for themselves ( if they had only had time for it ) . Quick to capitalize upon this , Grorley 's paper gave him a biweekly column , and he developed a considerable talent for telling men of good will . over Wednesday breakfast , the very thing they had been saying to one another at Tuesday night dinner . Grorley spent the war years doing this , always careful to keep his column , like his readers , one step behind events . With certain minor changes , he kept , too , that scheme of life which had started him writing , changing only , with affluence , to a more comfortable hotel . ' in time also , that savoir-faire whose loss he had mourned returned to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might otherwise have had  --  a wider experience , he told himself , being not only necessary to a man of his trade , but almost unavoidable in the practice of it . He often congratulated himself at having achieved , in a country which had almost completely domesticated the male , the perfect pattern for a man of temperament , and at times he became almost insufferable to some of his married men friends , when he dilated on the contrast between his " continental " way of life and their own . For by then , Grorley had reversed himself  --  it was his weekends and holidays that were now spent cozily en famille . It was pleasant , coming back to the house in Tarrytown on Friday evenings , coming back from the crusades , to find Eunice and the whole household decked out literally , and psychologically , for his return . One grew sentimentally fond of children whom one saw only under such conditions  --  Grorley 's Saturdays were now spent , as he himself boasted , " on all fours , " in the rejuvenating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods , and the zoos . Sundays and holidays he and Eunice often entertained their relatives , and if , as the turkey browned , he had a momentary twinge of his old mat de famine , he had but to remember that his hat was , after all , only hung in the hall . I T wAs only some years after the war that Eunice began to give trouble . Before that , their double menage had not been particularly unusual  --  almost all the households of couples their age had been upset in one way or another , and theirs had been more stable than many . During the war years Eunice had had plenty of company for her mid-week evenings , for all over America women had been managing bravely behind the scenes . But now that families hail long since paired off again , Eunice showed a disquieting tendency to want to be out in front . " No , you 'll have to come home for good , " she said to Grorley , at the end of their now frequent battles . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trouble with you , " said Grorley , " is that you 've never adjusted to postwar conditions . " " That was your 1946 column , " said Eunice . " If you must quote yourself , pick one a little more up-to-date . " Removing a jewel-encrusted slipper-toe from the fender , she made a feverish circle of the room , the velvet panniers of her housegown swinging dramatically behind her . She was one of those women who used their charge accounts for retaliation . With each crisis in their deteriorating relationship , Grorley noted gloomily , Eunice 's wardrobe had improved . " Now that the children are getting on , " he said , " you ought to have another interest . A hobby . " Eunice made a hissing sound . " 1947 ! " she said . In the weeks after , she made her position clear . Men , she told him , might have provided the interest lie suggested , but when a woman had made a vocation of one , it was not easy to start making a hobby of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds of Tabu at seven , if one had to be back to feel Georgic 's forehead at eleven . Besides , at their age , the only odd men out were likely to be hypochondriacs , or bachelors stilldreaming of mother , or very odd men indeed . " Ali the others , " she said nastily , " are already on somebody else 's hearth rug . Or out making the rounds with you . " Worst of all , she seemed to have lost her former reverence for Grorley 's work . If he had been a novelist or a poet , she said ( she even made use of the sticky word " creative " ) , there would have been more excuse for his need to go off into the silence . As it was , she saw no reason for his having to be so broody over analyzing the day 's proceedings at the UN . If he wanted an office , that should take care of things very adequately . But if he did not wish to live with her , then he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " you 're still in the Village . Maybe you better go back there . " Things were at this pass when Grorley 's paper sent him to London , on an assignment that kept him there for several months . He was put up for membership in several exclusively masculine clubs , and in their leonine atmosphere his outraged vanity ? ( " creative " indeed ! ) ? swelled anew . Finally , regrettably near the end of his stay , he met up with a redheaded young woman named Vida , who worked for a junior magazine by day , wrote poetry by night , and had once been in America for three weeks . She and Grorley held hands over the mutual hazards of the " creative " life , and on her lips the word was like a caress . For a woman , too , she was remarkably perceptive about the possessiveness of other women . " Yes , quite , " she had said . " Yes , quite . " When she and Grorley had made their final adieu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for just a minute , at arms ' length . " I shall be thinking of you over there , in one of those ghastly , what do you call them , living rooms , of yours . Everybody matted together , and the floor all over children  --  like beetles . Poor dear . I should think those living rooms must be the curse of the American family . Poor , poor dear . " Oil his return home in June , Grorley and Eunice agreed on a six-months trial separation prior to a divorce . Eunice showed a rather unfeeling calm in the lawyer 's office , immediately afterward popped the children in camp , and went off to the Gaspe with friends . Grorley took a sublet on the apartment in Waverly Place . It was furnished in a monastic modern admirably suited to the novel he intended to write , that he had promised Vida to write . H E HAD always liked summers in town , when the real aficionados of the city took over , and now this summer seemed to him intoxicating , flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daytime his freedom slouched unshaven ; in the evenings the streets echoed and banged with life , and the moon made a hot harlequinade of every alley . He revisited the San Remo , Julius ' , Chumley 's , Jack Delaney 's , and all the little Italian bars with backyard restaurants , his full heart and wallet carrying him quickly into the cameraderie of each . Occasionally he invited home some of the remarkables he mei on his rounds  --  a young Italian bookie , a huge St. Bernard of a woman who drove a taxi and had once lived on a barge on the East River , an attenuated young couple from Chapel Hill , who were honeymooning at the New School . " Mentally , " she said , " you 're still in the Village . Maybe you better go back there . " Now and then a few of his men friends from uptown joined him in a night out . A few of these , in turn , invited him home for the weekend , but although he kept sensibly silent on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospitality of their wives . By October , Grorley was having a certain difficulty with his weekends . His list of bids to the country was momentarily exhausted , and his own ideas had begun to flag . The children , home from camp , had aged suddenly into the gang phase ; they tore out to Movies and jamborees of their own , were weanable from these only by what Grorley could scrape up in the way of rodeos and football games , and assumed , once the afternoon 's treat was over , a faraway look of sufferance . Once or twice , when he took them home , he caught himself hoping that Eunice would ask him in for a drink , a chat that might conceivably lead to dinner , but she was always out , and Mrs. Lederer , the housekeeper , always pulled the children in as if they were packages whose delivery had been delayed , gave him a nasty nod , and shut the door . For a few weekends he held himself to his desk , trying to work up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt that it was going badly . Its best juice had been unwisely expended in long , analytic letters to Vida , and now , - in her air-mail replies , which bounced steadily and enthusiastically over the Atlantic , it began to seem more her novel than this . The Sunday before Thankscrivino. he made himself embark on a ski-train to Pittsfield , working up . a comforting sense of urgency over the early rising , the impedimenta to be checked . The crowd on the train was divided between a band of Swiss and German perfectionists who had no conversation , and a horde of young couples , rolling on the slopes like puppies , who had too much . Between them , Grorley 's privacy was respected to the point of insult . When he returned that night , he tossed his gear into a corner , where it wilted damply on his landlord 's blond rug , made himself a hot toddy  --  with a spasm of self-pity over his ability to do for himself  --  and sat down to face his fright . For years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewed coffee bean that renewed the wine-taster 's palate . He had lost the background from which to rebel . A CHRISTMAS CARILLON Thanksgiving day was the worst . The day dawned oyster-pale and stayed that way . Grorley slept as late as he could , then went out for ' a walk . The streets were slack , without the twitch of crowds , and the houses had a tight look of inner concentration . He turned toward the streets which held only shops , and walked uptown as far as Rockefeller Center . The rink was open , with its usual cast of characters  --  ricocheting children , a satiny , professional twirler from the Ice Show , and several solemn old men who skated upright in some Euclidian absorption of their own . Except for a few couples strolling along in the twin featurelessness of love , the crowd around the rink was type-cast . too . Here , it told itself , it participated in life ; here in this flying spectacle of flag and stone it could not possibly he alone . With set , shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its shoulders to the wind , turned up its collar , and leaned closer to the musical bonfire of the square . Grorley straightened up , turned on his heel , smoothed down his collar , and walked rapidly toward Sixth Avenue . He filled himself full of ham and eggs in one of the quick-order places that had no season , taxied home , downed a drink , swallowed two Seconal tablets , and went to bed . The next morning , seated at his desk , he took a relieved look at the street . People were hard at their normal grind again ; for a while the vacuum was past . But Christmas was not going to catch him alone . With set teeth , 0 picked up the phone . At the end of the day he was quite heartened . Although he had not yet turned up an invitation for Christmas Day , he had netted himself a cocktail party , which might easily go on to dinner , for two days before , a bid to an egg-nog party on New Year 's Day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of people did things impromptu . A phone call now and then would fix him up somehow . ? But by Christmas week he was haggard . He had visualized himself as bidden to share , in a pleasantly avuncular capacity , some close friend 's family gathering ; he had seen himself as indolently and safely centered , but not anchored , in the bright poinsettia of their day . Apparently their vision of him was cast in a harsher mold ; they returned his innuendoes with little more than a pointed sympathy . Only two propositions had turned up , onefrom a group of men , alone like himself for one reason or another , who were forming a party at an inn in the Poconos , and one from a waif-like spinster ? " Last Christmas was my last one with dear mother  --  who offered to cook dinner for him in her apartment . Shuddering , he turned down both of these . The last thing he wanted to do on that day was to ally himself with waifs of any description ; on that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family cocoon , looking out at them . v WALLY , the day before Christmas , he thought of the Mecchers . Ted was that blue-ribbon bore , the successful account executive who believed in his slogans , and his wife , a former social worker , matched him in her own field . Out of Ted 's sense of what was due his position in the agency , and Sybil 's sense of duty to the world , they had created a model home in Chappaqua , equipped with four children , two Bedlingtons , a games room , and a part-time pony . Despite this , they were often hard up for guests , since most people could seldom be compelled twice to their table , where a guest was the focus of a constant stream of self-congratulation from either end . Moreover , Ted had wormed his way into more than one stag party at Grorley 's , and could hardly refuse a touch . And their Christmas , whatever its other drawbacks , would be a four-color job , on the best stock . But Ted 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary . turned reedy and doubtful when he heard Grorley 's inquiry . " Uh-oh ! ' Fraid that puts me on the spot , fella . Yeah . Kind of got it in the neck from Sybil , last time I came home from your place . Yeah . Had a real old-fashioned hassel . Guess I better not risk reminding her just yet . But , say ! How about coming up here right now , for the office party ? " Grorley declined , and hung up . Off-campus boy this time of year , that 's what I am , he thought . He looked at his mantelpiece crowded with its reminders  --  greetings from Grace and Bill , Jane and Tom , Peg and jack , Etcetera and Mrs. Etcetera . On top of the pile was another air-mail from Vida , received that morning , picture enclosed . Sans the red in the hair , without the thrush tones of the assenting voice , she looked a little long in the teeth . Her hands and feet , he remembered , were always cold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not think that central heating would improve them . " The living room is the curse , " she had said . That 's it , he thought ; that 's it . And this , Vida , is the season of the living room . He looked down into the street . The Village was all right for the summer , lie thought . But now the periphery of the season had changed . In summer , the year spins on a youth-charged axis , and a man 's muscles have a spurious oil . But this is the end toward which it spins . Only three hundred days to , Christmas . Only a month  --  a week . And then , every year , the damned day itself , catching him with its holly claws , sounding its platitudes like carillons . Down at the corner , carols bugled steamily from a mission soup-kitchen . There 's no escape from it , he thought . Turn on the radio , and its alleluia licks you with tremolo tongue . In every store window flameth housegown , nuzzleth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The season has shifted inward , Grorley , and you 're on the outside , looking in . He moved toward the phone , grabbed it , and dialed the number before he remembered that you had to get the operator for Tarrytown . He replaced the receiver . Whatever . he had to say , and he was n't quite sure what , or how , it was n't for the ears of the kids or the Lederer woman . He jammed on his hat . Better get there first , get inside the door . DING up to Grand Central in the cab , he pressed his face against the glass . Everything had been taken care of weeks ago  --  the kids had been sent their two-wheelers , and he had mailed Eunice an extra-large check  --  one he had n't sent through the lawyer . But at five o'clock Fifth Avenue still shone like an enormous blue sugar-plum revolving in a tutti-frutti rain of light . Here was the season in all its questionable glory ? the hallmarked joy of giving , the good will dinmink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinted faces , walked with levitated step . In the train , he avoided the smoker , and chose an uncrowded car up front . At his sta-tion , he waited until all the gleaming car muzzles pointed at the train had picked up their loads and gone , then walked through the main street which led to his part of town . All was lit up here too , with a more intimate , household shine . He passed the pink clamp of a butcher 's , the bright fuzz of Woolworth 's , " Sold out ! " said a woman , emerging . " ' S try the A &; P. " lie walked on , invisible , his face pressed to the shop window of the world . At Schlumbohn 's Credit Jewelery Corner he paused , feeling for the wallet filled with cash yesterday for the still not impossible yes over the phone . This was the sort of store that he and Eunice , people like them , never thought of entering . It sold watches pinned to cards , zircons , musical powder-boxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Truelove blue-white diamonds . Something for Everybody , it said . He opened the door . Inside a magnetic salesgirl nipped him toward her like a pin . He had barely stuttered his wants before he acquired an Add-a-Pearl necklace for Sally , two Genuine Pinseal handbags for his mother-in-law and Mrs. Lederer , and a Stag-horn knife with three blades , a nail-file , and a corkscrew , for young George . He had left Eunice until last , but with each purchase , a shabby , telephoning day had dropped from him . Dizzy with participation , lie surveyed the mottoed store . " Something . .. something for the wife , " he said . " Our ? lovely Lifetime Watch , perhaps ? Or Something in Silver , for the House ? " The clerk tapped her teeth , gauging him . He leaned closer , understanding suddenly why housewives , encysted in lonely houses , burbled confidences to the grocer , made an audience of the milkman . " We 've had a  --  Little Tiff . " " Aw-w , " said the clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me see . . . . " She kindled suddenly , raised a sibylline finger , beckoned him further down the counter , and drew , out a tray of gold charms . Rummaging among them with a long , opalescent nail , she passed over minute cocktail shakers , bird cages , tennis rackets , a tiny scroll bearing the words , " If you can see this , you 're too darn close , " and seized a trinket she held up for view . A large gold shamrock , hung on a chain by a swivel through its middle , it bore the letter I on its upper leaf , on its nether one the letter U. She reversed it . L.O.V.E . was engraved across the diameter of the other side . The clerk spun it with her accomplished nail . " See ? " she said . The season has shifted inward , Grorley , and you 're on the outside , looking in . " Spin it Spin it and it says I. L.O.V.E . U ! " " Hmmm. . , " said Grorley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess you ca n't fob some women off with just a diamond bracelet . " She tittered dutifully . But , as she handed it to him with his other packages , and closed the glass door behind him , he saw her shrug something , laughing , to another clerk : She had seen that he was not Schlumbohn 's usual , after all . As he walked up his own street he felt that he was , after all , hardly anybody 's usual , tonight . It was a pretty street , of no particular architectural striving . Not a competitive street , except sometimes , in summer , on the subject of gardens . And , of course , now . In every house the tree was up and lit , in the window nearest the passer-by . Here was his own , with the same blue lights that had lasted , with some tinkering on his part , year after year . Eunice must have had a man in to fix them . He stopped on the path . A man in . She was pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable . Ile had taken for granted that his family , in his absence , would have remained reasonably static . They always had . He 'd been thinking of himself . Silently , he peeled off another layer of self-knowledge . He still was . He walked up the steps wondering what kind of man might rise to be introduced , perhaps from his own armchair . One of her faded , footballish resurrections ? from Ohio State U. , perhaps : Gordon , this is Jim Jerk , from home . Or would she hand it to him atonce ? Would it be : Dear , this is Gordon . The door was unlocked . He closed it softly behind him , and stood listening . This was the unmistakable quiet of an empty house  --  as if the secret respiration of all objects in it had just stopped at his entrance . The only light downstairs was the glowing tree . He went up the stairs . 1 N THE bedroom , the curtains were drawn , the night light on . The bed was piled with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He dropped the presents on the bed , tossed his hat after them , let his coat slip down on the familiar chair , and parted the curtains . It had a good view of the river , his house . He stood there , savoring it . He was still there wh 2u a car door slammed and the family came up the path . The Christmas Eve pantomime , of course , held every year at the village hall . Georgie had on one of those white burno : - ) ses they always draped the boys in. and Sally , in long dress and coned hat , seemed to be a medieval lady . He saw that this year she had the waist for it . Eunice and Mrs. Lederer walked behind them . He tapped on the glass . They raised their faces in tableau . The children waved , cat-called , and disappeared through the downstairs door . Mrs. Lederer followed them . Below , Eunice stared upward , in the shine from the tree-window . Behind him , he heard that sound made only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staircase . As they swarmed in on him , she disappeared . " You shoulda been to the hall , " said Georgie , seizing him . " Christmas at King Arthur 's court . I was a knight . " " Was it corny ! " said Sally , from a distance . She caught sight of herself in a pier glass . " I was Guinevere . " " Had to do some last-minute shopping , " said Grorley . " I saw my bike ! " said Georgie . " It 's in the cellar . " " Oh . . Georgie ! " said Sally . " Well , I could n't help seeing it . " " Over there are some Christmas Eve presents , " said Grorley . " Open now ? " they said . He nodded . They fell upon them . " Gee , " said Georgic , looking down at the knife . " Is that neat ! " From his tone it was clear that lie , at least , was Schlumbohn 's usual . " Oh , Dad ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised her arms artistically above her head , in the fifth position , minced forward , and placed their slender wreath around Grotley 's neck . As she hung on him , sacklike , he felt that she saw them both , a tender picture , in some lurking pier glass of her mind . The door opened , and Eunice came in . She shut . it behind her with a " not before the servants " air , and stood looking at him . He face was blurred at the edges ; she had not decked herself out for anybody . She looked the way a tired , pretty woman , of a certain age and responsibilities , might look at the hour before dinner , at the moment when age and prettiness tussle for her face , and age momentarily has won . " Look what I got ! " Georgie brandished the knife . " And mine ! " Sally undulated herself . " Mutns ! Does n't it just go ! " She stopped , looking from father to mother , her face hesitant , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Later , " said Eunice . " Right now I think Mrs. Lederer wants you both to help with the chestnuts . " " No fair , no fair , " said Georgie . " You saw ours . " " Do what your mother says , " said Grorley . The paternal phrase , how it steadied him , was almost a hearthstone under his feet . " Oh , well , " said Eunice , wilting toward the children , as she invariably did when he was stern with them . Opening the package he indicated , she drew out the bauble . Georgie rushed to look at it , awarded it a quick , classifying disinterest , and returned to his knife . " Oo  --  I know how to work those ! Margie 's sister has one , " said Sally . She worked it . " If that is n't corny ! " she gurgled . Eunice 's head was bent over the gift . Sally straightened up , gave her and Grorley a swift , amending glance . " But cute ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the lightning changes that were the bane of her thirteen years , she began to cry . " Honestly , it 's sweet ! " she said . Grorley looped an arm around her , gave her a squeeze and a kiss . " Now , shoo , " he said . " Both of you . " When he turned back to the room , Eunice was looking out the window , chin up , her face not quite averted . Recognizing the posture , he quailed . It was the stance of the possessor of the stellar role  --  of the nightingale with her heart against the thorn . It was the stance of the woman who demands her scene . He sighed , rat-tatted his fingers on the table top . " Well , " he said . " Guess this is the season the corn grows tall . " A small movement of her shoulder . The back of her head to him . Now protocol demanded that he talk , into her silence , dredging his self-abasement until he hit upon some remark that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , to show it up for the heartless , illogical , tawdry remark that it was . He could repeat a list of the game birds of North America , or a passage from the Congressional Record . The effect would be the same . " Go on , " he said , " get it over with . I deserve it . I just want you to know ... mentally , I 'm out of the Village . " She turned , head up , nostrils dilated . Her mouth opened . " Get it ov ? ! " Breath failed her . But not for long . M UCH later , they linked arms in front of the same window . Supper had been eaten , the turkey had been trussed , the children at last persuaded into their beds . That was the consolatory side of family life , Grorley thought  --  the long , Olympian codas of the emotions were cut short by the niggling detail . Women thought otherwise , of course . In the past , he had himself . Eunice began clearing off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father 's and Mother 's ? " " Oh Lord . I forgot Father . " " Never mind . I 'll look in the white elephant box . " The household phrase  --  how comfortably it rang . She looked up . " What 's in these then ? " " For Mother and Mrs. Lederer . Those leather satchel-things . Pinseal . " " Both the same , I 'll bet . " , He nodded . Eunice began to laugh . " Oh , Lord . How they 'll hate it . " She continued to laugh , fondly , until Grorley sharked response . This , too , was familiar . Masculine gifts : the inappropriateness thereof . But Eunice continued to laugh , steadily , hysterically , clutching her stomach , collapsing into a chair . " It 's that hat , " she said . " It 's that s-specimen of a hat ! " Grorley 's hat lay on the bed , where he had flung it . Brazenly dirty , limp denizen of bars , it reared sideways on a crest of tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown . " L-like something out of Hogarth , " she said . " The R-rounder 's Return . " Grorley forced a smile . " You can buy me another . " " Mmmm . . . for Christmas . " She stopped laughing . " You know . . . I think that 's what convinced me  --  your coming back tonight . Knowing you  --  that complex of yours . Suppose 1 felt if you meant to stand us through the holidays , you meant to stand us for good . " Grorley coughed , bent to stuff some paper into the wastebasket . In fancy , lie was stuffing in a picture too , portrait of Vida , woman of imagination , outdistanced forever by the value of a woman who had none . Eunice yawned . " Oh . . . I forgot to turn out the tree . " " I 'll go down . " " Here , take this . along . " She piled his arms with crushed paper . In grinning afterthought , she clapped the hat on his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bin . The kitchen was in chaos , the cookery methods of alt Wien demanding that each meal rise like a phoenix , from a flaming muddle belowstairs . Tomorrow , as Mrs. Lederer mellowed with wine , they would hear once again of her grandfather 's house , where the coffee was not even roasted until the guests ' carriages appeared in the driveway . In the dining room , the table was set in state , from damask to silver nut dishes . Father would sit there . He was teetotal , but anecdotalism signs no pledge . His jousts as purchasing agent for the city of his birth now left both narrator and listener with the impression that lie had built it as well . They would hear from Mother too . It was unfortunate that her bit of glory  --  her father had once attended Grover Cleveland  --  should have crystallized itself in that one sentence so shifty for false teeth ? " Yes , my father was a physician , you know . " Grorley signed , and walked into the living room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river . There to the south , somewhere in that jittering corona of yellow lights , was the apartment . He shuddered pleasurably , thinking of all the waifs in the world tonight . His own safety was too new for altruism ; it was only by a paring of luck as thin as this pane of glass that he was safely here  --  on the inside , looking out . Behind him , the tree shone  --  that trompel'oeil triumphant  --  yearly symbol of how eternally people had to use the spurious to catch at the real . If there was an angel at the top , then this was the devil at its base  --  that , at this season , anybody who opened his eyes and ears too wide caught the poor fools , caught himself , hard at it . Home is where the heart .. the best things in life are . . spin it and it says I.L.O.V.E.U. Grorley reached up absently , and took off his hat . This is middle age , he thought . Stand still and hear the sound of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the platitudes , sternly coming true . He looked down at the hat in his hand . It was an able hat ; not every hat could cock a snook like that one . From now on , he 'd need every ally he could muster . Holding it , he bent down , and switched off the tree . He was out of the living room and halfway up the stairs , still holding it , before he turned back . Now the house was entirely dark , but he needed no light other than the last red sputter of rebellion in his heart . He crept down , felt along the wall , clasped a remembered hook . Firmly , he hung his hat in the hall . Then he turned , and went back up the stairs .
