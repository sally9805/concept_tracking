At the rate of 50 a minute , 120,000 people swarmed into Manhattan 's Waldorf-Astoria last week to inspect General Motors ' annual road show , the Motorama for 1955 . On display were more than 100 exhibits , and , as usual , the stars were G.M. 's cars of the future . But this time there was a difference . In past years the dream cars were almost all flashy sports models ; this year they looked as if they might be next year 's production models . Pontiac , for instance , featured the Strato-Star , a six-passenger hardtop ; Oldsmobile showed off its Delta , a four-passenger hardtop . Flashiest of the fleet was the LaSalle II sports roadster , a low-slung ( 42.8-in. - high ) model with a reinforced glass-fiber body and an experimental 150-h.p. , V-6 engine that G.M. engineers hope will enable them to cut down on engine space in the future . <P> For hot-rodders ' wives , G.M. 's Frigidaire division showed off a " kitchen of tomorrow . " At the touch of a button , chopping boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed to the cook . Cooking surfaces fold back into the wall when not in use , hard-to-reach shelves glide down to shoulder level at the touch of a hand , refrigerators automatically serve cold water , ice cubes or crushed ice . On one side of the kitchen there is a " home-planner 's desk " with a TV set that can be tuned so the housewife can peer into the living room and nursery or see who is at the front door . <P> The telephone has an amplifying unit so that the cook can carry on a conversation from anywhere in the kitchen without touching the phone . Heavy roasts can be moved by nudging a traveling tray that hangs from the ceiling ; food can be carried outdoors on a serving cart powered by a battery . With dual-control ovens , a meal can be started in the kitchen and finished from an adjoining patio . For barbecues in the house there is a special gadget that passes charcoal or hickory smoke through the oven .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
