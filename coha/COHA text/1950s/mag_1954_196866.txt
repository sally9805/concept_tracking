Sidney Franklin is brave with a cold , serene and intelligent " valor . . . No history of bullfighting that is ever written can be complete unless it gives him the space he is entitled to . <P> - Ernest Hemingway , <P> Death in the Afternoon ( 1932 ) <P> Brooklyn-born Torero Franklin , now 50 and scarred by repeated gorings , has hung up his matador 's suit , but he is still deep in his old sport . Nowadays Franklin is content to be the impresario of the bull ring at the small ( pop . 18,000 ) Andalusian city of Alcal de Guadaira , where he can teach the youngsters , and drink manzanilla with the oldtimers in the quiet evenings at the town casino . Last week Senor Franklino , as he is known at Alcal , outraged the aficionados . <P> It all started when Don Plcido , owner of the mule team that drags the bulls out of the ring after the kill , decided that he was not getting enough pay . Moreover , Don Plcido felt he deserved twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Don Plcido made his demands last week , and Franklin gave him a firm no . <P> " In that case , " said Don Plcido , convinced that Franklin would give in because there is no other muletero in town , " no mules this afternoon . " Franklin shrugged : " O.K. , have it your own way . " <P> After the first kill , the spectators waited for the caparisoned mule team to enter the ring . Instead , when the gate opened , in drove Franklin , a broad grin on his tanned face , at the wheel of his Chrysler station wagon . The crowd watched in stunned silence as Franklin roped the bull 's horns and tied the rope to the rear bumper . Back at the wheel , he towed the bull around the arena amidst an uproar of catcalls , hoots and laughter . Then he drove out . Three times that afternoon , Franklin drove into the ring and hauled away the carcass . <P> That night there was a deathly stillness when Franklin turned up at the casino . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correo Andaluz and started reading . One Alcal cattle dealer , braver than his fellows , crossed the smoky room , cleared his throat and said : " Listen Senor Franklino . If Plcido fails to show up another time , just let me know . I 'll bring down my team of working mules from the farm . Please never do that again . It 's bad for the fiesta . " Franklin rose , bowed gravely and replied : " Thank you , senor . I 'll do that . I 'm sorry , but I could not accept a bullying from Plcido . Not even for the fiesta . " <P> The atmosphere cleared up . Once again Alcal de Guadaira was proud of its one and only norteamericano . Over the manzanilla , Alcal relaxed .
