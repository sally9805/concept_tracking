Roberto Rossellini 's The Miracle , filmed in 1948 and now current as part of a two-hour , three-layer omnibus titled Ways of Love ( TIME , Dec. 18 ) , is second-rate Rossellini despite a virtuoso performance by Anna Magnani . Performing a minor acting miracle herself , she makes almost credible her role as an insane peasant woman who believes she is to bear a holy child fathered by Saint Joseph . <P> Last week The Miracle made headlines by offending Edward T. McCaffrey , $15,000-a-year license commissioner of New York City and onetime national commander of the Catholic War Veterans . McCaffrey , a holdover from the O'Dwyer administration , has power to grant , suspend and revoke the licenses of the city 's movie theaters ( as well as of legitimate theaters , laundries , bowling alleys , etc . ) . After Ways of Love had been running for more than a week , McCaffrey sent the Paris Theater an order to stop showing The Miracle or face suspension-and possibly revocation-of its license . The movie , he said , was " blasphemous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegrams of protest . Critics who had panned the movie spoke up for anybody 's right to see it . Joseph Burstyn , distributor of Ways of Love , pointed out that after The Miracle was shown in Italy , the Vatican approved Rossellini 's plan to do a movie about Saint Francis of Assisi . If the Vatican was not offended by The Miracle , Burstyn implied , who was a mere license commissioner to object ? Furthermore , although the film had been " condemned " by the Catholic Legion of Decency as " sacrilegious and blasphemous , " it had been passed by the New York state censors , National Board of Review and Customs Bureau . <P> <P> The commissioner stuck stubbornly to his edict and Burstyn 's lawyers went to court . At week 's end , State Supreme Court Justice Henry Clay Greenberg threatened a temporary injunction against the edict . " I am concerned , " he said , " with whether the commissioner has a right to set himself up as a dictator . " At that point , McCaffrey weakened . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ban . That evening , any New Yorker with the price of a ticket ( $1.50 ) could see The Miracle and judge for himself whether it was worth all the todo .
