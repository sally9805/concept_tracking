The musical news in Berlin last week was a ballet-opera , Columbus . Written by a 50-year-old German composer named Werner Egk , it deals with Columbus ' journeys to America and has some mildly metaphysical ideas built into the libretto . But Berlin was less interested in the story than in the style . Composer Egk ( rhymes with peck ) has his principal singers stand inconspicuously beside the orchestra while ballet dancers enact the story . The chorus is posted behind gauze curtains . <P> The story picks up Columbus at the court of Ferdinand and Isabella , follows him to America and on his triumphant return to Spain . But another voyage brings disillusionment ; his crewmen abuse the confidence of the Indians and quarrel over their loot . Columbus himself is finally brought back to Spain in chains-to die with the belated realization that justice and reason are more precious than silver and gold . Best things in Egk 's score : a clear song line , dramatic choruses and an effective handling of Spanish and Indian folk tunes . <P> Berlin 's critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best news Bavarian-born Egk has had in a long time . He got his start in 1926 when lie showed some pieces to Composer Kurt Weill , who recommended him for a job composing bits for a radio station . Nine years later Egk wrote an opera , The Magic Violin , which has become part of the regular repertory in German opera houses . Impressed , the Berlin State Opera hired him as a conductor . Under the Nazis , Egk 's career throve pleasantly enough , although he got a stiff reprimand in 1938 for " working along the lines of ' Kulturbolschewist ' Kurt Weill . " He had a brief wartime success with a ballet , Joan of Zarissa , which was produced in occupied Paris . After the war , Egk went through the denazification wringer and was finally cleared . <P> Egk is now considered one of the hopes of postwar German music . Says respected Critic H. H. Stuckenschmidt : " He belongs to the school of moderately modern music . . . not very modern , but played with most modern means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says he : " Opera must again become a real show , like French baroque opera , meant for eye &; ear .
