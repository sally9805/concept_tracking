Britain 's biggest ( 96 players ) and best-known orchestra , the BBC Symphony , last week got its first new conductor in 20 years . The new man , who will replace retiring Sir Adrian Boult this summer : handsome , popular Sir Malcolm Sargent , 55 , until 1948 founder-conductor of the Liverpool Philharmonic . <P> The directors of the government-subsidized BBC had searched for more than a year for a conductor who would take the job . They had dangled the 10,000 salary before Sir John Barbirolli , but he preferred to stick with his beloved Halle Orchestra in Manchester for less money . Brilliant young Czech Conductor Rafael Kubelik was tempted , but he turned it down to take over the Chicago Symphony ( TIME , Jan. 9 ) . After six months of negotiation , Sir Malcolm had accepted on condition that he could spend half his time free-lancing at home &; abroad and conducting the roof-raising choral concerts which are his specialty ( he has recorded both Handel 's Messiah and Mendelssohn 's Elijah for Columbia ) . <P> Conductor Sargent 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BBC orchestra . He has frequently guest-conducted it , and declared himself well pleased . Most English critics rank it as one of Britain 's top three ( the other two : Sir Thomas Beecham 's Royal Philharmonic , Barbirolli 's Hall ) . If it has not won the prestige in Britain that Arturo Toscanini 's NBC Symphony has achieved in the U.S. , that is mainly because , as one British critic put it , " the BBC has not had a Toscanini . " But in 20 years the BBC has become a solid box-office attraction both in London , where it divides its time between the studio and the concert hall , and on provincial tours . One reason : the BBC has always offered its listeners palatable programs , heavy on the classics , with a good spicing of moderns and popular gems . <P> Sir Malcolm has no intention of changing any of that . Says he : " At a concert performance one can perform a new work and be reasonably sure that the people have come to hear it . But on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority of 10 million people want to hear what you are playing . " <P> One change he is determined to make . So far , the BBC has played its broadcast performances in a huge , empty studio in suburban Maida Vale . If Sir Malcolm has his way , he will open the doors to an invited public as Toscanini and the NBC orchestra do . Says he : " One misses the presence of people listening . "
