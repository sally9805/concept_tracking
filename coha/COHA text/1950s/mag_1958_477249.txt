for Dixie ( Norton , $3.50 ) has considerable topical interest because the author is editor of the Little Rock newspaper , the Arkansas Gazelle , but it is one of the many virtues of the hook that it rises above and looks beyond the events of the moment in an attempt to see where the South as a whole is headed . Ashrnore 's general conclusion is indicated clearly enough by his title : he believes that the form of Southern society that has prevailed in the eighty years since Reconstruction , a society based on sharecropping , one-party politics , and segregation , is clone for . The forces that favor segregation in his opinion do not really expect to win ; their battle cry is not " on to victory " but only " not in this generation " ; behind the seemingly solid facade of the white South he believes that there is much real diversity of opinion and uneasiness about the status quo . Although Ashmore never puts the case this way , he seems to see the defender of the post-Reconstruction style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is first the external enemy that can be called by such names as the North or the Supreme Court or the NAACP ; this enemy can be argued with and about , can be encountered in law courts and excoriated in legislature halls , and might even be defeated . But there is another enemy , an internal , unnamed enemy , a kind of Southern fifth column , which is an ineradicable fact of life and can not be legislated or sued or fought out of existence ? that is , the revolution in the Southern economy that makes a caste system obsolete . Sharecropping and one-party politics are on their way out , and segregation will goslowly ? with them . Ashmore pays little attention to the first " enemy " ; most of his book is devoted to changes in the South itself that make segregation an unworkable scheme . He tacitly affirms that segregation is a Southern problem , not on the old grounds that the South knows what is best for the Negro but on the grounds that the Southis going through a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new status for the Negro is only one part ? that her Northern critics will just have to be patient for a while longer . One of Ashmore 's most valuable gifts is his ability to say just as little for the comfort of his Northern reader as for his Southern neighbor . He does not bother to disguise his contempt for those Southern leaders , like the present Governor of Arkansas , who capitalize on the race issue , though he argues convincingly that there has often been ( more in the past than at present ) an element of vaudeville in Southern racial demagoguery that was recognized and appreciated by both the performer and his audience . He looks upon contemporary racist leaders as simply tragically irrelevant to the work in hand , something like those leaders of newly independent nations who still campaign on a platform of anti-colonialism . E T , little as he expects of the leaders of the segregation forces and hopeless as he thinks their cause is , Ashmore does not believe that the changes now taking place in the South will result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees it , will be something like Texas , by which he apparently means that it will retain a certain amount of self-conscious and superficial local color while actually accepting the standards of the rest of the country with a vengeance ? talking states ' rights , for instance , but greedy for federal help and tax privileges . In his recent hook , The Reluctant Empire , George Fuermann observes that the rest of the United States looks upon Texas in much the same way as the rest of the world looks upon the United States ? as a force that is brash and crude but rich and vigorous , without culture but without the restrictions that go with the culture , half threat and half promise . This seems to be fairly close to what Ashmore has in mind when he speaks of Texas as the model ( or the fate ) of the New South . Ashmore is able to specify some of the qualities that he thinks arc being lost in the South today . He thinks that as legal segregation diminishes , a kind of spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the races . He points out that he grew up knowing Negroes in a way that his daughter does not know them ; one of his older relatives once replied to a genealogical inquiry with the observation that he figured the Family was kin to just about everybody in the county , white and black , one way or another ; that sense of kinship , Ashmore thinks , is now being lost . And he sees some loss in the breakup of the one-party South : the Southern Democrats , partly because they were so thoroughly entrenched at home , were often able to act more far-sightedly in national and international politics than their more shallow-rooted Northern colleagues . Nor does Ashmore entirely forget how much that entrenchment cost . Behind An Epitaph for Dixie there is not only extensive observation but also wide reading in the leading modern writers on the South ? V. 0 . Key , the late Howard Odum , C. Vann Woodward , and so on . The two writers whose influence is most marked are William Faulkner and the late W. J. Cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteen years old but happily available as an Anchor Book at 950 and still eminently worth reading ) . An Epitaph for Dixie is essentially an epilogue to Cash 's work , bringing it up to date , and it is enough to say in its praise that it is worthy to stand in that relationship . In general Ashmore is a little distrustful of the contemporary literary image of the South ; he quotes an amusing account by another Southern journalist ( Harry Golden ) of how Tennessee Williams ' Baby Dolt would have to be rewritten to bring it into line with the facts of Southern life : the protagonist becomes a New York manufacturer of foundation garments who moves to the South in search of cheap labor , Baby Doll is a model he has given a share of the business , and the antagonist is an organizer for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union . But in spite of his feeling that some Southern literature is misleading , Ashmore often relies on Faulkner 's massive myth of the South as a frame for his own analysis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the proud Sartorises ( Faulkner 's old established family ) to the poor and ignorant but crafty Snopeses ( Faulkner 's poor whites ) , " When the Charleston News &; Courier issues its call for all good men to come to the aid of the Old South , it is not a Hampton who steps forward , but one of the Snopes boys , mentally calculating the possible profit from the dues of a Citizens Council , " Ashmore writes , and he quotes a " cynical old planter " to the effect that Dixie will have reached the end of the road when a rich Negro leaves a widow with sufficient holdings to justify one of the Snopes boys ' marrying her for her money . " Yet Ashmore does not despair of the Snopeses . He believes that they are shaking off their poverty , educating their children , and in the future will demand both more of the nation 's bounty and better leadership . NO BOUNDARIES A T BOTTOM ' Ashmore sees the South of sharecropping , one-party politics , and segregation as the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its passing American society will be thoroughly homogenized and without local flavor . To this extent his epitaph is a lament . In a passage near the end of the book he tells how he has at last come to feel at peace with New York , because " New York no longer has any boundaries ... it is everywhere that telephones and radio and television can reach ... there is nothing left now to confine it , no physical boundaries and no permanent , distinctive regional attitudes . " Southern writers and intellectuals often exaggerate the homogeneity of Northern society because they know only the large cities of the North : they identify the whole North with New York though they would he reluctant to grant that Birmingham or Atlanta is the " real " South . Yet Ashmore is undoubtedly right in finding geographical differences increasingly unimportant in American life . In contemporary American fiction , for instance , it no longer makes very much . difference where a writer conies from unless he is a Southerner or very much difference in what part of the country his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the novelist 's South , as Ashmore points out , is in clanger of becoming less a place than a literary convention . Some novelists continue to have a loose regional affiliation ? Marquand belongs to New England and O'Hara to Pennsylvania , but readers of James Gould Cozzens ' sensationally successful By Love Possessed have located the town where the action takes place all the way from New Hampshire to Maryland , and there seems to be no way of pinning it down very exactly . To be sure there is still such a thing as a " Western " story , but a Western is by this time usually either a fairy tale or an historical novel . Yet there remains , both in fact and in fiction , a very large part of America that is not New York . It is not so much a matter of geography as of size ; one thing that must strike any reader who follows American novels is the persistence of the small town in fiction , and not just the ersatz small town where the tarnished New York advertising man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the expenTHE NEW BOOKS sive Connecticut suburb play-acting at being a small town ( such a community bears about the same relation to a real small town as Marie Antoinette 's milking hears to dairying ) , but the thing itself . ROBERT TRAVER 'S Anatomy of a Murder ( St. Martin 's Press , $4.50 ) is a case in point . The novel is set in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan , a region that probably strikes most readers as fairly out of the way . Yct except for a few topographical details and one point of law , it might have been set in Maine or Kansas or Oregon ; there is almost nothing in manners or language or style of life that localizes the story . But the one place it could not be set is New York , or any other large city . The atmosphere , the attitudes , and even the style of writing are invincibly small town , though not the small town of any particular region . Traver 's story is told by the attorney for the defense , who until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district attorney . The trial is an opportunity for him to defeat in the courtroom the man who has recently defeated him at the polls , as well as a chance to establish himself as a criminal lawyer and to lay the foundation for a further political career . Traver does not go very deep into human motivation , he uses a certain number of rather stale literary devices , and the murder itself is not a particularly interesting crime , chiefly because neither murderer nor murderee is a very interesting man . But the book is less the story of a murder , in spite of its title , than the story of a trial for murder , and the account of the trial is irresistible , as such accounts usually are . The author writes under a pseudonym ( he is a justice of the Supreme Court of Michigan ) , and for many readers the chief attraction of Anatomy of a Murder will be the insight it provides in the way lawyers go about their work . It is a bit chilling to see the extent to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man being tried seems hardly more than incidental , something like a cow that wanders into a steak-fry . The outcome depends on the manipulation of the concept of Traver characterizes as " primitive and nonsensical , " not without reason on the evidence he provides . The style of the book is corny but inoffensive . ( A Book-of-the-Month Club selection . ) T HE small town that provides the setting for William Humphrey 's Hume from the Hill ( Knopf , $3.95 ) is situated in East Texas , and the place is carefully localized through the use of dialect and other details , though perhaps the most important fact about the setting is that it lies , in a literary though not in a geographical sense , in the Faulkner country . There are three main characters ? the father , a hero of the first world war , a famous hunter , and an equally famous philanderer ; the mother , a woman who has been deeply shocked by her husband 's affairs and determined to rear their only son in sexual purity ; and the son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing anything about his philandering . The central situation develops when the son learns about his father 's sexual career and sees in it an all-too-clear portent of his own nature . Humphrey is so gifted a writer , as he has already demonstrated in a number of fine short stories , that it is ungenerous to suggest that Home from time Hill , his first novel , is less than a complete success . Yet , fine as the writing is , the structure of the book is too schematic . The father philanders on a scale that most middle-aged men would find wearing , and the son is innocent to an extent that seems extremely unlikely in the circumstances . .1'he narrative is trimmed down until it is stark and spare , like a legend or a ballad , but it becomes a little mechanical in its neat disclosure of one terrible consequence after another , until the reader has trouble in avoiding the feeling that fate is being generously assisted by the author in propelling the characters toward their dark destinies . It is a pity that Humphrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which plays over one scene ( the baptism of a child ) with fine macabre results . More humor might have detracted from the tragic effect , good deal more convincing as an image of life . In spite of these reservations , Home from the Hill is a carefully made piece of work by a writer of undeniable talent , and anyone who reads it will look forward to Humphrey 's next book . CATCHALL AMES JONES 'S mammoth TAMES second novel , Some Came Running ( Scribner , $7.50 ) , also takes place in a small town , this time in Central Illinois . The place has considerable individual character : it is one of those Illinois communities where Northern and Southern strains in the population meet ( the Southern strain augmented since the second world war by the immigration of some of Faulkner 's Snopeses ) , and it has a touch of glamor left behind by some high-living , free-spending Pennsylvania oil millionaires who lived there during a brief oil boom earlier in the century . Unfortunately most of what takes place in Jones 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,266 pages of Some Came Running are less a novel than a collection of parts of novels , ideas for novels , comments on the difficulty of writing novels , and disquisitions on whatever happened to come into Jones 's head . There are discussions of hick ( which is said to be located in " a gland in the brain " ) , of how to cook potatoes , of the place of reincarnation in Christian theology ( Christ is said to have taught reincarnation but St. Paul cut it out of the Gospels ) , of the relation between a writer 's sex life and his work , of the state of the highways between Nashville and Chattanooga , of the place of physical affection in the rearing of children , and of endless other subjects of varying degrees of relevance . One would be tempted to say that everything is in the book except the kitchen sink except for the fact that at least three kitchen sinks come in for mention . The narrative excuse for this smorgasbord is rather simple : in 1947 , at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small Illinois town which he had left in haste nineteen years before when he " got a farm girl in trollhis older brother Frank , who was acting as head of the family and was anxious to make it more respectable . Dave comes back with the idea of staying only long enough to embarrass Frank , who is now prosperous and about to become more so . But he decides to settle down and even goes into a business partnership with Frank when he discovers that he is falling in love with Gwen French , a teacher in the local college and the most wildly improbable heroine of the season . Gwen refuses to marry Dave because she is a virgin ( this is all perfectly absurd ) , but she does agree to become his mentor in his attempt to resume the career as a writer that he had started before the war . From here on the book is mostly about Art and Artist . Various characters wander in and out , there are sex sprees and drinking bouts and a fight , but chiefly there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem in Some Came Running that occupied him in From Here to Eternity : the problem of the man of violence in a society that both needs his violence and penalizes him for it . Private Pruitt in From Here to Eternity lives an unresolved paradox : his violence constantly gets him in trouble with his society ( the Army ) , yet it is the very quality that makes him a good soldier . So Jones seems to see the artist : society needs his art , but in order to produce his art he must live a life in conflict with society . Yet From Here to Eternity was a readable hook and Some Came Running is not . One difference between them is that the first novel was written from the author 's feelings , which were chaotic but powerful , and the new book is written from the author 's intellect , which is chaotic but not powerful . Furthermore , the Army provides a framework in which the conflict between the violent man and the powersthat-he can be dramatized , and a small town , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest difference between them lies in the fact that the first book kept its focus on events and consequently had some shape and discipline , while the new book is flabby and self-indulgent . The writ-88 pseudo-words like bourgeoisness , officiality , and sanguinarily ; such action as there is is often absurd and incoherent . At bottom the trouble seems to be that Jones has taken himself in ; he has come to believe in his own myth . Being a writer is not nearly so important a thing as Jones thinks it is . Being a good writer may be , but he has a long way to go before he is a good writer . I N My Face for the World to See ( Harper , $3 ) Alfred Hayes has written a novel in which the setting is also fate ; Hollywood is both where the story takes place and what happens to the characters . There are only two of any importance ? the man who tells the story , a writer from New York who goes out to Hollywood from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who thinks of himself as an uninvolved spectator in the movie colony ; and a beautiful , half-demented girl who has accepted the whole Hollywood dream as a personal promise . The man engages in what he means to be a casual affair with the girl , but the relationship gets out of hand , and in the end he must recognize that he too is involved , that Hollywood has corrupted him in his way just as much as it has corrupted the girl in hers . The novel is very adroitly written , in smooth , seemingly effortless prose , and it attains great force in the passages where the girl describes the terrible hallucinations she has suffered : she has thought that she was being tested in all kinds of cruel and anonymous ways to see if she was really worthy of stardom ; she has passed through periods when she thought that everyone she met was an incognito emissary of " the studio " collie to put her through some trial before she enters into her glory . The ending of the hook is a little disappointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the girl too soon , leaving little to be revealed in the end . But My Face for the World to See is a skillful , disturbing book . T H E short stories in First Love and Other Early Sorrows ( Dial , $3.50 ) , a first collection by a gifted key , fall into two groups or cycles . One group deals with a boy who grows up in St. Louis and goes to Harvard , the other with a girl called Laura , who might conceivably be the wife of the boy from St. Louis after he has grown up . As a writer Brudkey could be hastily described as everything James Jones is not . His prose is cultivated , flexible , totally free of straining for effect , and his most notable characteristic is a kind of pervasive gentleness . He ordinarily deals with a very few characters more or less isolated from a social context , and the kind of situation he usually chooses is a situation that shows the difficulty people have in staying in touch with each other , the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In one way the stories suffer from being collected together ? since each cycle concerns the same person , the stories in it read almost like chapters from an unfinished novel . But they also have an effect as a group that they do not have singly : they are sadder . This does not result from the events in the stories , which are not particularly sad , but from some quality in the writing itself , a tone of elegy or note of resignation . These stories may he too quiet and undramatic to attract a large audience , but they are distinguished fiction , as readers of Brodkey 's " The Sound of Moorish Laughter " in the May 1956 issue of Harper 's will know . T H E authors of Kilometre 95 ( Houghton Mifflin , $3.95 ) are an Israeli husband-and-wife writing team , Herbert Russcol and Margalit Banal , and their novel is set in contemporary Israel , chiefly on a communal farm ( kibbutz ) on the Gaza border and in Tel Aviv . The Russcols portray the internal stresses in Israeli society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or uneasiness be-tween those who fought in the regular army of liberation , the Haganah , and those who fought with the terrorist Stern Gang ; the Jews of European origin find it hard to accept the Middle Eastern Jews as their own people , especially when a question of intermarriage with kibbutz who are daily exposed to Arab raids and working to reclaim the desert doubt that the safe city-dwellers in Tel Aviv are doing their share for the new nation ; and the " kibbutzniks " themselves are divided on the question of whether it is better to take direct action against Arab raiders or to leave such incidents to the United Nations . But the Russcols do not limit themselves to picturing the divisive forces in Israel ; they also convey a sense of its powerful unifying force : the determination to endure . Kilometre 95 is not very impressive as a novel , but it is a fascinating picture of a society that has so far been little portrayed in fiction , at least in Eng-lish , WHERE Kilometre 95 concerns a kind of life that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad ? The Man on the Rock , by the young English novelist Francis King ( Pantheon , $3.5O ) ? is an account of a life that is hopeless . The chief character and narrator in the book is a Greek named Spiro . Orphaned in the Greek civil war that followed the second world war , Spiro has since made his way by his looks and his nerve . He is a parasite in a society that offers him few alternative ways of making a living , and he vents his hatred of his own dependency by destroying anyone who dares to help him . He is successively taken up by an American relief worker , the wife of a rich English businessman , and the daughter of a Greek shipping magnate , all of whom love him after their more or less ambiguous fashions , and each of whom he destroys . The Man on the Rock will strike some readers as just nasty , and no one could pretend that it tells a pretty story . But the Greek background is brilliantly sketched , the characterization is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sibyl , by the Swedish novelist and Nobel Prize winner Par Lagerkvist ( Random House , $3 ) , is a very curious work , almost impossible to describe without making it sound either blasphemous or ridiculous or both . It is really a fable about the nature of God ; the closest thing to it among recent hooks in English that come to mind is C. S. Lewis 's Till We have Faces , and that is not very close . The Sibyl is an account of an encounter between the Wandering Jew and a woman who has served as a sibyl in a Creek temple . The Wandering Jew speaks first , telling how he is condemned to eternal restlessness because he has denied rest to the Son of God . Then the sibyl takes over , telling how she has borne a son who may also be God 's , a son who has grown up to be the idiot who shares her cave . As the man and woman finish their stories they realize that the idiot has disappeared . They follow his tracks up the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has ascended . The manner of The Sibyl is a little portentous ; something seems always about to be disclosed that never appears , and the thought of the hook is hardly complex enough to justify the amount of narrative that is required to convey it . Whatever may be true of the Swedish original , the English translation by Naomi Walford is chaste and elegant .
