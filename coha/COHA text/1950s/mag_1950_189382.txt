THE OUTLANDER ( 290 pp. ) - Germaine Guevremont-Whittlesey House ( $3 ) . <P> Everyone was curious about the Stranger but no one ever found out who he was . He had stopped at the Beauchemin 's farmhouse one autumn evening to ask for food . When he was invited in to dinner , he stayed on for a year . The Stranger was a great yarner and a great toper but he was also a tremendous worker and he more than earned his keep . Before he left Monk 's Inlet , a tiny farm hamlet on the St. Lawrence River in Quebec , he had left his mark on the lives of all who came in contact with him . Old Widower Beauchemin loved him more than he loved his own lazy son , and Neighbor Angelina Desmarais had fallen madly in love with him . <P> For all his effect on the pious , closefisted French Canadian farm folk of Monk 's Inlet , the Stranger is really only a literary device . Canadian Author Germaine Guevremont has used him and his outland ways simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a countryside she describes with affectionate fidelity . The Outlander is a completely unpretentious novel of place , almost entirely without plot , and only incidentally concerned with human characters . Nature broods omnisciently over the story , making even birth and death seem but fragments in a larger design . <P> Published in 1945 , the first half of The Outlander won a Canadian literary award , won another when it was published in France . The Outlander makes no pretense to literary importance . But Madame Guevremont , 53 , mother of four children , writes about her paysans and their river farms with calm . Gallic simplicity . Although her awkwardly woven novel has many literary holes , they let in a great deal of the human light that better craftsmen often block out .
