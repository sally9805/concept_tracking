txt Letters to The Times RAHMAN PAJVAK , A.C. MILLSPAUGRIAN H. MCMURCHIE.E.D . KING.A SAD BUT HOPEFUL NE ... Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I wish , in this letter , to comment on the editorial published in THE NEW YORK TIMES of Oct. 6 , and also on the news dispatches which appeared in your issues of Oct. 5 and 7 , falsely asserting that Afghan troops had invaded Pakistan territory . I am authorized to state officially that this allegation is absolutely without foundation . No Afghan troops have taken part in any action against Pakistan . It is the people of Pakhtunistan who have been driven into taking some measures for their own protection . , The Pakhtuns ( Pathans ) are not " raiding . " They demand only their legitimate right of independence , a claim they have always pressed by peaceful means and which for the last two years has been met by the aggressive policy of the Pakistan Government , subjecting them to bombing and attacks in which men , women and children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " more than a local incident , " a point which was long ago brought to the attention of the peace-loving peoples of the world and which has been continuously and increasingly apparent since Pakistan 's adoption of this aggressive policy against the will of the millions of Pakhtuns desiring only to live freely and at peace in their own fatherland . It is regrettable that the gravity and dangers inherent in the situation were never recognized . Nobody denies the troubled state of the world today , but suggestions like that contained in your editorial do not help toward a solution . The importance of the desire of the people for their independence is at last gaining recognition . In the NorthWest Frontier all ways and means have been tried but this , which is why " it has been for centuries one of the explosive spots of the world . " It only remains for me to assure you positively that the Kabul Government has not been " throwing fuel on the fire , " and has no intention of so doing . On the contrary , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government to preserve peace along its borders the fire would long since have blazed up and spread . As for the attitude of the Bengal Lancers , perhaps you are able to decide how the dead are affected by the actions of the living , but allow me to leave it to your readers to guess their reactions on hearing that the people they oppressed in vain are today fighting against those who shared in this oppression for the preservation of their rights . There is no doubt , in the words of Abdur Rahman which you quote , " every A'fghan prays when he goes to bed that Allah will give him a soldier 's death on the battlefield . " But I assure you that they pray to die fighting only in the cause of peace . RAHMAN PAJTAK , Information Officer , Government of Afghanistan Delegation to the United Nations General Assembly . New York , Oct. 7 , 1950 . Dr. Millspaugh 's Stand Given To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have just noticed in THE TIMES of Sept. 27 a dispatch from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotes the Shah , Mohammed Reza Pahlevi , as making a curious and somewhat amusing reference to myself . The Shah is quoted as saying : " The war completely disrupted our life . One of the worst of our experiences was Dr. Millspaugh , who has tremendous responsibility for our bankruptcy and lack of discipline , created by the occupation of our country . " It is true that I served for two years during the war period as Administrator General of the Finances of Iran . If I figured during that time as one of the worst of the Iranians ' experiences I must have possessed truly superhuman capabilities . The Shah appears to have me confused with the war and the Allied military occupation of Iran , to say nothing of the Russians in Azerbaijan . It is impossible here to go into the particulars of what the Shah rightly calls Iran 's bankruptcy , a bankruptcy , however , that is more moral than financial . Nor is it possible to set forth in this place the intricacies of my wartime relations with the intriguing Iranians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Americans in Persia , " published in 1946 by the Brookings Institution , Washington , D. C. Since this book told the truth about Iran , it may explain in part why the Shah should consider me a peculiarly distressing experience . 4 .. C. MILLSPAUGH . Kalamazoo , Mich. , Oct. 3 , 1950 . Government Asked to Take Steps to Halt Further Deterioration To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The natural preoccupation of the American people with events in Korea and the anxiety with which they view the possibility of a new world war should not prevent them from undertaking a most serious examination of their economic position and prospects at home . The stark fact is that while We are justifiably proud of our imminent victory in Korea , we are suffering an important defeat on the domestic front . I refer to the great increase in prices since the Acrean war started , and the almost irresistible inflationary consequences of our projected defense measures . Already the pinch Is being felt by millions of American families , and other millions face a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be realistic to speak of a 35-cent dollar ( in terms of 1939 ) by the middle of 1951 . It may be that organized labor and important industrial interests technically can keep pace with this decline in the purchasing power of the dollar , but this will not be true of a less-fortunate but very large segment of the American population . I allude especially to the unorganized segment ? of labor , the whitecollar classes generally , elderly dependents on fixed small annuities or family support , agricultural laborers , and widows and their dependents living on small incomes . These classes have no effective spokesmen in Congress and must remain mute in their suffering . As long as these millions of helpless and dependent Americans sink further into penury and hardship we have no re &; son to accept their plight without prom test . And if other groups of Americans who thus far consider themselves more fortunate should recall the massive blows dealt against their counterparts by inflation in other nations they would no longer remain complacent in the face of the hardships they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country is not halted . It is time for America to act in its own defense at home as well as abroad . This means that our Government must at once take the necessary steps to Prevent a further decline in the value of the dollar . E. D. KING . New York , Oct. 2 , 1950 . Pakistan Invasion Denied No Afghan Troops Have Taken Part in Any Action , It Is Said Improved Police Methods Asked To THE EDITOR OF THE NEw YORK TIMES : The letter of Robert B. Goldmann in your issue of Sept. 29 , complaining of the manners of New York police , is very much to the point . The only criticism that can be made of it is to say that Mr. Goldmann understated his case . The writer , who has traveled extensively , believes that the manners and attitude of the " finest " are among the worst in the Englishspeaking world . It is to be hoped that the new Police Commissioner will not overlook another reprehensible *phase of police behavior . I refer to the brutality with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with them . Despite conclusive evidence magistrates presiding over hearings on complaints of this nature apparently can never he convinced that the police have been brutal  --  although every sophisticated citizen of the city knows it goes on all the time . About two years ago when there were several complaints of police brutality7=one of them I recall was made by a newspaper reporter , who alleged that he was beaten when he " argued " with a policeman in a traffic case  --  the then Police Commissioner made a public statement to the effect that he did not want decent people beaten , " hut , " he said , " that does n't go for ' bums ' who hang around the streets insulting women , etc . " One of our newspapers commented editorially that it was too much to expect a policeman to always know the difference between a reporter and a " bum " and called upon the Commissioner to plainly tell his men : " If you see a crime committed by anyone  --  turn ' or decent pergai.6 ? , , arrest him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will be discharged . and punished . " Ridding our Police Department of corruption and brutality is a herculean task  --  it requires a big man to do it . IAN H. MaluRC HIE . New York , Sept. 29 , 1950 . Preventing Dollar Decline For a Cleaner City To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have just returned from a tour of Europe and have been deeply shocked to find that New York , which is possibly the richest city in the world , is by all odds the filthiest . I can not understand the irresponsibility of the city government and of the citizens toward the streets , sidewalks and parks of this city . Even the bombedout cities of Germany are full of flowers , and their streets and sidewalks are well swept . Why ca n't the citizens of New York refrain from throwing their litter in the streets , and why do we not have an adequate street cleaning department ? Also , why does not the Park Department beautify public places with flowers ? The beauty of flowers undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appearance of this city . I hope that before election all the candidates will pledge themselves to make New York City clean and beautiful and that the voters will see to it that they carry out their promises . A SAD BUT HOPEFUL NEW YORKER . New York , Oct. 5 , 1950.
