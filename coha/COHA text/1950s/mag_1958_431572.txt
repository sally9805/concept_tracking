@#  | A delicate creative art @# In current weeks , members of our State Department ationed in many far-flung capitals are wrestling some ticklish problems concerning kings and s . Some must be handled with finesse , but none res diplomacy , for the kings and queens are the far ones to be found in every deck of playing cards . for once the role each monarch is intended to play been carefully prearranged. e occasion is the second annual World-Wide Bridge Tournament sponsored by the Department of State ? . Information Agency Recreation Association . By ns of 16 prepared " par " hands , U.S. Government Personnel from Kalamazoo to Timbuctu will be able to pete among themselves in a little world championwithout traveling from the area where each is oned . Here is a typical deal from last year 's tournament . I eve that it will give you a good idea of the kind of Diems which will be met. dealer - the- South vulnerable The creation of par hands is a delicate art but one at which Geoffrey Mott-Smith , who prepares and scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A par-maker 's plan is often upset by unexpected bidding resulting in an unforeseen contract or making the " wrong " hand declarer and thus altering the effect of the opening lead . In this deal , however , whether South rebids one no trump or two clubs ( in which case North should raise to three clubs ) he should become the no trump declarer . It is on this assumption that the playing problem has been built into the hand . Declarer tries to win the first spade by playing dummy 's queen , but East covers with the king . It does n't much matter whether declarer ducks this trick or wins the ace at once . He can hardly hope to shut out the opponent with the long spades , and if he gives up a trick to the ace of hearts the opponents will run enough spades to beat him . That boils the problem down to the comparatively simple one of finding the best chance to win four tricks each in clubs and diamonds . One menace is the possibility of finding an opponent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this danger only if the length is with West . So the correct play is to cash the ace and queen , retaining dummy 's king and 10 for a possible finesse . But West 's jack drops under the queen , and that worry is eliminated . Now what more does declarer need than to find East with the king of diamonds ? The answer is that he may need to make three diamond leads from dummy . And here is where the careful player is distinguished from the card pusher . When the jack of clubs appears , declarer should overtake his own queen with dummy 's king . Then , when the diamond finesse succeeds , he gets back to dummy by playing the 7 of clubs and overtaking with dummy 's 10 . The diamond finesse is again taken successfully , and now South leads the club 2 and overtakes it with dummy 's 6 . This vital third reentry is the key to the success of the entire play , for it enables South to take a third diamond finesse ? without which he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TRICK If you would like to take a crack at playing the same hands which will decide the 1958 State Department tournament , you can obtain diagrams of all 16 deals , plus a copy of the analysis of how the hands should have been bid and played in order to win the pars , by sending 100 , to Tournament Hands , P.O.
