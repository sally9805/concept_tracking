John Foster Dulles arrived in Tokyo last week to begin discussions on a Japanese peace treaty . He drew a record reception . One hundred fifty Japanese newspapermen jammed the airport to meet him . As photographers were knocked off their stepladders in the rush , flustered colonels from General MacArthur 's staff tried to keep order . One newsman scooped all the others-with a view of the empty office Dulles might use . <P> Premier Shigeru Yoshida and the other Japanese politicians whom Dulles will see were ready for some close negotiating . The anti-Communist Japanese have little doubt about whose side they are on , but it was as plain as the peak of Mount Fuji that , in return for a pro-U.S. policy , Japan 's statesmen intend to squeeze as much U.S. aid as they can out of any peace treaty . <P> In his first statement , Dulles said that he would approach Japan " as a party to be consulted , and not as a vanquished nation to be dictated to by the victors .
