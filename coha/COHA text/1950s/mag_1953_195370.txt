By the time guards threw open the White House gates at 9 a.m .. a crowd of 500 was waiting to get in . President Eisenhower had revived a local tradition , the Easter Monday egg roll on the White House lawn , started in 1877 by Rutherford Hayes and abandoned twelve years ago by Franklin Roosevelt . The Eisenhowers really did n't know what to expect , but the gardeners began a week in advance preparing for the worst , installing storm fences , comfort stations and drinking fountains . <P> . At 9:35 , David and Barbara Anne Eisenhower , carrying Easter baskets , came outdoors to join the fun . David distributed five souvenir eggs to pleading adults .

Finally a flying wedge of Secret Service men led the Eisenhowers out a side gate , back to the White House by way of a side street . Said Ike : " I did n't think the kids would take such a beating . " <P> When it was all over and the last of 30,000 egg rollers had departed in an April drizzle , the gardeners began a cleanup job that may take two weeks . Surveying the mess , Chief Gardener Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " egg shell has a certain amount of lime in it . "
