Back in the ' 20s , soon after Charles ( " Get-Rich-Quick " ) Ponzi went broke Offering Bostonians " double your money " in six months , Moran &; Mack , the " Two Black Crows " of vaudeville and radio , told a story about raising pigs on their farm . The pigs cost $4 apiece and were fattened for the market , but brought only $4 when sold . <P> " Why , you ca n't make money that way , " Moran would say , shocked . <P> " Ya-as , " Mack would sigh , " we found that out . " <P> Last week a Brazilian air force lieutenant named Luiz Felipe Albuquerque Jr. , 30 , also found out . Having lifted some $35 million from Brazilians in a fantastic **29;8643;TOOLONG scheme ( and thereby out-Ponziing Ponzi , whose operations never topped $15 million ) , Albuquerque found that he had gone broke . On the front page of his newspaper Diario do Rio , he printed a shattering notice : " On this date , for unforeseen reasons I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that my business would fail were right . . . I shall not run away . . . My creditors will be paid . . . Remain calm , my friends . . . " <P> To Help Humanity . Albuquerque 's friends and creditors had fallen for a scheme of classic simplicity . Starting two years ago , he offered to buy fellow officers ' cars for 30% more than their value , and pay off in five months . Then he turned the cars into ready cash to invest in any likely venture ( except the liquor and cigarette businesses and outright gambling ; these were taboo , he said , under the Baptist principles he had been converted to while in flight training at Texas ' Randolph Field in 1944 ) . " I want to help humanity , " he said . " Brazil is a country with very little money . With $500 you ca n't do much . But with $5,000 you can do a lot , and with $50,000 almost anything . " <P> All he had to do was keep on borrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As month after month he paid off on his lOUs , air force officers in droves sold their cars for his notes , which were soon known at all air bases as felipetas . When the Air Ministry heard of his dealings and called him in , the lieutenant explained himself so convincingly that the big brass offered to sell him their cars . But he was advised to switch to a reserve commission and give all his time to business . <P> Out of uniform , Albuquerque did even better . He had a four-room suite of offices in Rio , and branches in three other cities ; he bought a newspaper , formed an export-import firm , owned a fleet of 66 taxicabs and four taxi planes , launched a trucking business and bought a partnership in an established car-selling agency . Hourly his 22 messengers dashed out to pay off felipetas . Albuquerque declared that his greatest desire was " to put a copy of the New Testament in the hand and heart of every Brazilian .
