HE capital of the West Indies island of Jamaica is Kingston , a teeming community of more than 225,000 population that lies against one of the most breath-taking tropical backgrounds in the world . Approaching Kingston by sea , the traveler crosses great harbor  --  once the haven of notorious pirates  --  toward rows of stately palm trees and sun-burnished roofs beyond which rugged green mountainsides sweep upward some 7000 feet to hazy blue peaks . Or if he arrives by air , the city is a splash of pale pastels between the hills and the foamy malachite of the Caribbean Sea . It would be nothing leas than miraculous if any city lived up to such surroundings , and it is best to report without delay that Kingston has strong colors and discordant noises , but no architectural miracles to compare with its setting . Nor was the city 's beauty improved when last August 's hurricane swept furiously across the island , although the greatest storm damage was in the farming areas along the south coast . The business district of the largest city in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretches northward in precise geometric lines for a dozen blocks that are crowded with haphazard two-story structures , a dozen modern stores and a scattering THE SATURDAY KINGSTON , JAMAICA ( Continued from Page 32 ) of public buildings . Then the city flows out across the Liguanea Plain to the mountains , where handsome residences and resort hotels cling to steep and breezy slopes above the capital . By day , Kingston is bustling and crowded under a beaming sun that drives the thermometer up into the eighties , but is tempered by low humidity and cooling winds from the ocean . Police in gleaming sun helmets , white jackets and red-striped blue trousers direct traffic with rigid military gestures . Honking automobiles , lumbering donkey carts and restless streams of pedestrians wind through the main streets and the dusty byways . Tourists descend on the city from big cruise ships in the harbor and from a steady flow of airplanes , for Kingston is a busy crossroads of the Caribbean . Down from the hills to the great , clamoring market places come thousands of farm women with produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the backs of donkeys or piled high in trucks . By night , Kingston relapses into silence and inky darkness broken only by clusters of lights around the graceful Myrtle Bank Hotel on the harbor , by the glare of signs on half a dozen motion-picture theaters and night clubs , and by the gleam of candles and small fires where peasant families wrapped in shawls and blankets sleep by the roadside to be ready for opening of the markets at dawn . As the principal port and only large city of Jamaica , Kingston is the gateway to a land once lavishly rich in sugar , bananas , spices and coconuts , but which in recent years has been pushed into dangerous economic shoals by an expanding population that now totals more than 1,250,000 on an island only 144 miles long . It is also a city in the midst of transition  --  a kind of symbol of the current struggle of the British West Indies to emerge from the old colonial era into a sound , modern economic status . This effort , vitally important to the Caribbean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrasts and contradictions in which the raucous liveliness of the urban masses , the steamy atmosphere of political controversy and the first budding of American business techniques are mingled under the long-established overlay of sedate British colonial life . Such a jumble of ideas and attitudes makes for a certain amount of confusion and occasional irritation , which is sometimes aggravated by the growing influx of American tourists . One " Indignant Reader " ? obviously an old-time British colonial resident ? recently protested in a letter to a local newspaper against the " disgraceful practice " of some stores that displayed articles bearing price tags marked not in pounds sterling , but in dollars . If this indication of catering to Yankee tourists was a blow at the foundation of the British Empire , the merchants of Kingston managed to take it in their stride . In the last year , around 75,000 tourists and vacationers got rid of more than $10,000,000 at the island 's resort spots in an outburst of spending that was comparable only to the days when seventeenth-century pirates swarmed into the harbor laden with priceless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingston , although not in the most favored resort area , considered it good business , and local experts , such EVENING POST as Tourist Commissioner F. H. Robertson and Travel Bureau Manager Victor Husband , believe that with a bit more government help tourism would soon outstrip sugar as Jamaica 's leading industry . The casual tourists , on the other hand , are likely to get the impression that Kingston 's principal industry is straw hats and baskets if they make the error of judging merely by the vast numbers of straw articles in all sizes and shapes that they see for sale by the roadside , on the street corners and in the stores . Straw products are among the leading money-makers for handicraft workers , and the local jipijapa straw hats , similar to Panamas , are the finest in the West Indies . The city 's efforts , however , are not entirely concentrated on either tourism or straw weaving . There is a strong backbone of industry allied with the island 's agriculture for the manufacture of such products as rum , copra and cigarettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe factories , tanneries and building-material concerns . There are two alert daily newspapers ? the Gleaner and the Express ? and there are branches of five big British and Canadian banks in addition to the Government Savings Bank . Kingston is the site of a new experiment in higher education , the Univer* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * sity College , as well as of the Jamaica School of Agriculture , the Government Technical School and the Institute of Jamaica , where art and cultural treasures of the island are collected . One of the world 's finest exhibitions of tropical vegetation , particularly orchids and bougainvillaea , is the 200-acre Hope Botanical Gardens , which the government operates in the suburbs of the city . Jamaicans are avid sports fans , and cricket , football and tennis draw big crowds , as does the picturesque Knutsford Park Race Course , only a short distance from the business district . In the business area there is only one first-class hotel and virtually no restaurants worthy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the nearby hills , however , there are such top-notch hotels as the Courtleigh Manor , the mountaintop Bamboo Lodge and Capt . R. C. S. Rutty 's famous Manor House , all of which benefit from the swimming pools , golf links , cooling breezes and gorgeous scenery of the higher altitudes . Such luxuries , however , are merely frosting on Kingston 's cake . The city was settled on the low coastal plain in order to be close to the twenty-one square miles of sheltered harbor , and the long docks and loading platforms stretching along the water front are still its chief commercial asset . The island had been discovered by Columbus on his second voyage , and he made a return visit there in 1503 . At that time he was shipwrecked , had much difficulty putting down a mutiny and almost starved to death for the greater part of a year because his men made enemies of the native Arawak Indians . The Arawaks were a copperFebruary 9 , 1952 colored people , beardless and with straight black hair . They had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remarkably high elevation was given to the backs of their heads , which were said to be so hard that they blunted the blades of Spanish swords . This may well have been true because the Spaniards spared the sword , but worked the Arawaks to death in short order . There is little left of their culture except the English version of their island 's name , which the Spaniards spelled Xaymaca ? meaning isle of many springs or rivers . The Spaniards brought in African slaves to supplant the Indians , and they established the island capital at Villa de la Vega , now known as Spanish Town , thirteen miles from Kingston harbor , in 1534 . They held on to the island for more than a century , but in 1655 it was seized by British forces , and its 3000 inhabitants , mostly slaves , were proclaimed British subjects . By that time the great Caribbean pirate industry was booming and the town of Port Royal , at the end of an eight-mile-long spit of land enclosing what is now Kingston harbor , became their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adventurers from every corner of the world . In the next half century Port Royal was notorious as the richest and wickedest little city on earth . One contemporary writer observed : The place was a gilded Hades . Bearded seamen , bronzed and weather-stained , bedecked with priceless jewellery and the finest silks of the Orient , swaggered along its quays and gambled with heavy gold coins . Drinking shops were filled with cups of gold and silver , embellished with flashing gems torn from half a hundred cathedrals . Common seamen hung their ears with heavy gold rings studded with the costliest gems . Dagger thrusts were common . . and the body of a murdered man would remain in a dancing room until the dance was over . Gold and precious stones were cheap , but life was cheaper . Every man lived beneath the shadow of the gallows . Outstanding among the buccaneers was Henry Morgan , " admiral " of the pirate fleets , scourge of the Spanish and the most fabulous of the outlaws who strode the streets of Port Royal . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Spaniards in the Caribbean area , but there came a time when buccaneering began to get out of hand . At that point , London solved an awkward problem by knighting Morgan and making him governor and captain general of Jamaica . This worked out fine for everybody except Sir Henry 's old pals , the pirates , who were promptly hanged in large batches  --  often twentyfive at a time  --  by the new governor . Such measures might have wiped out the local pirate business and made Port Royal a respectable city in time ? but there was n't time . At noon on June 7 , 1692 , there was a thunderous noise in the brassy sky , the crowded waters of the harbor trembled madly and the finest city in the West Indies all but vanished in an earthquake and tidal wave . Thousands of persons , ships and buildings simply disappeared und er the water . There was a short struggle to rebuild part of the town , blit a few years later a fire completed the destruction , and almost the entire surviving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal continued as a naval base centered around ancient Fort Charles  --  one commander there was a callow youth who became famous as Lord Nelson  --  but in time it dwindled ( 44 THE SATURDAY ( Continued from Page 42 ) to a sleepy suburb of Kingston , visited mainly by sight-seers who still poke through the ruins , peer at huge thirtyfoot sailing-ship anchors buried in the sands , and toss stones at gaily striped zebra fish circling through the crystal waters . After World War II , Port Royal perked up a bit with the opening of a busy little boatyard and establishment of a new fishing-and-boating club , but its luck did n't last long . The 1951 hurricane , which killed about 160 persons and did more than $50,000,000 damage on the island as a whole , almost wiped out Port Royal again . The little community was one of the hardest hit in the storm , which did comparatively little damage to Jamaica 's main tourist areas and caused only a brief interruption in air transportation or other services . Meantime , Kingston grew rapidly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port of entry " of the island , and by the middle of the eighteenth century was clamoring to have the seat of government moved there from Spanish Town . A bill for that purpose was passed by the assembly , but no sooner had the government archives been moved to Kingston than a great public clamor arose against the change and , amid threats of disorder , the decision was reversed . A large body of soldiers was needed to escort the archives safely back to Spanish Town , and it was not until more than a century later that bitter feelings had died down sufficiently to permit the permanent shifting of the government to Kingston in 1872 . From that time on , however , the new capital was the acknowledged center of business , government and social life . A severe earthquake in January of 1907 , followed by fire , destroyed a large part of the city , but it was quickly rebuilt . Although Kingston was a typical British colonial city and the British dominated Jamaica 's commercial and agricultural activities , it was an immigrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first part of this century as the ablest merchant of the community . Isla arrived in Kingston with no more worldly goods than he could carry on his back , a peddler who sold from door to door . But in a period of rapid growth of the city he became a successful dry-goods merchant , branched out into the importing business , bought real estate and became interested in many other enterprises , until eventually E. A. lean &; Bro. seemed to have a finger in almost every pie in Jamaica . The growth of Kingston and of its business monopoly did not , however , mean a corresponding expansion of the economy of the island generally . On the contrary , an expanding population and other problems  --  the bottom fell out of the world sugar market in the 1920 's  --  had started Jamaica on the downgrade long before the depression of the 1930 's took its toll . Matters came to a head in Kingston in 1938 . Unemployment was at unprecedented heights . Slum conditions , always bad , were intensified . Such conditions provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , led to serious street rioting . The results of this period were of far-reaching importance in the political development of the island , which had always been ruled by the tiny white minority . Now the British Government took up the idea of initiating an experiment in colonial selfgovernment at Kingston , and at the same time the people began to find EVENING POST political leaders . One of the leaders was a Negro lawyer , a Rhodes scholar and a socialist , Norman Washington Manley . The other was a tall , stringbean , brown-skinned orator  --  and a cousin of Manley  --  calling himself Alexander Bustamante , a name he had adopted . Bustamante and Manley organized the People 's National Party and the first unions . The tall , angular Bustamante , with an unruly shock of white hair and a voice that was like magic with the crowd , was a hero of the workers because he had been knocked around and jailed by the police during the 1938 riots . Within a short time he was also a demagogic but absolute dictator of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mind and frequently disrupting the city 's commerce with strikes . Eventually , during World War II , he was interned for threatening a water-front strike , but his power with the people kept on growing . Manley was chiefly responsible for the new constitution which was proclaimed in 1944 . It established the right of the people  --  only 6 per cent of them had ever voted before  --  to elect a House of Representatives by universal suffrage . It also set up an Executive Council , on which there were five elected members , but the Colonial Office maintained its control of the government through five appointed members and the governor , who acts as chairman of the council . The constitution was , nevertheless , regarded as a great experimental step toward self-government and provided for further progress when warranted . Manley 's People 's National Party was presumably the greatest political force in the island , but when Bustamante was released prior to the 1944 election , he split away from the PNP , formed the Jamaica Labor Party and waged a melodramatic campaign against his cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whites fell on deaf ears , but at the last moment the whites dropped their own candidates and threw their support to the Labor Party , which won twenty-two of the thirty-two seats in the House . Only one white member was elected to the new legislative body . The two parties and their respective union organizations have been more or less at war ever since , and the division of votes in the 1949 election was extremely close , although Bustamante February 9 , 1952 held his power by winning seventeen seats in the House . This situation has ' provided Kingston with many lively political rumpuses , but has n't done a great deal to advance the purpose of the experiment in self-government .. Most important results for Kingston have been government measures to clean up some of the worst slums  --  a few new ones have since arisen  --  and the construction of several low-incomehousing developments . Handicraft and road-building projects also have helped relieve the unemployment problem , and the government has pushed a movement to get workers onto small farms , mainly by buying large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then selling small parcels to settlers on the installment plan . More than 150 such settlements , accommodating more than 100,000 persons , have been established in this way . Some advance has been made in recent years toward moving colored Jamaicans into many responsible civilservice positions that in the past were monopolized by whites , who total only about 25,000 on the entire island . There is no formal color line in Kingston , but most of the big business concerns are owned by whites , while managerial and supervisory jobs are often held by members of the city 's brown aristocracy . A large percentage of the small storekeepers are drawn from some 60 , - 000 Jamaicans of Oriental descent , while the great mass of the workers and peasant farmers are Negroes . The ordinary Jamaican is an able worker with a great . deal of natural dignity , but a long history of enforced backwardness has put him under serious handicaps that hinder current attempts to deal with the island 's difficult political , educational and economic problems . Kingston is considerably further advanced in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegitimacy , for example , is estimated at 70 per cent , because even where families are firmly established , the parents more often than not just never bothered with a marriage ceremony This national aberration was given public emphasis for the first time only a few years ago when Lady Huggins , wife of the then governor Sir John Huggins and an industrious worker on behalf of the common folk , organized a series of mass weddings for couples who had offspring , but had neglected to make their union official . Many ( ) . 46 scores of couples took advantage of the free ceremonies arranged by Lady Huggins , who gave each woman an inexpensive wedding ring and admonished each couple to remember her slogan : " Every child deserves a father ! " A major obstacle in educational development lies in the fact that the great masses of workers and peasants speak Jamaican English , a strange form of speech that no visitor would easily recognize as having any connection with the English language . Spoken in a slurred , often musical manner , Jamaican English is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Portuguese , French and even Arawak Indian words ; obeah , or witchcraft , terminology ; mispronounced words and just plain local slang . Only those who have grown up with it can understand the jargon when it is spoken rapidly . A less-complicated example is the following verse : But wen worries go fa tek yuh Dem naw come one bi one . Bad luck wuss dan obeahman Dali mark yuh wid him han . The less-literate section of the population also is plagued by the ghost of African witchcraft , or obeah , and a primitive kind of religious cult whose members are known as pocomaniansthose who conjure up " a little madness . " The government and the churches ? there are many sects , ranging from the Church of England to Jehovah 's Witnesses  --  have more or less suppressed obeah except for sporadic secret exploitation of the superstitious . But pocomanian cults flourish in the poorer sections of Kingston . The pocomanian cults differ in various localities , but most of them include a touch of African tribal rites and a touch of the old-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recently described by a Kingston reporter , had a King Shepherd as leader , a Holy Mother in charge of women 's activities , and such other officers as a Waterman , an Axman , a Hunterman , a Wheelerman and a Sword Bearer . Members assemble in an open yard at dusk on Saturday nights for a session that may last all night and through most of Sunday . The King Shepherd , in elaborate robes and headdress , sits on a swivel chair or stool in the center of the yard , and his Wheeler-man turns him from time to time so that he can face various members of the cult . He speaks in " an unknown tongue , " and members of the cult sing , jump up and down to the beat of drums , utter unintelligible words and , if the frenzy is great enough , foam at the mouth , foretell the future and fall to the ground in a kind of cataleptic state that may last for many hours . Such primitive manifestations are far removed from the soft lights and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole life of the capital and the island is strongly colored by the juxtaposition of African , European and American cultures . A good paved highway , for example , runs westward out , of Kingston to Mandeville , a sedate and typically English resort and residential village where tea is served on the dot each afternoon . Yet only a few miles to the north are isolated native villages in the Land of Look-Behind , which can be traversed only by narrow trails through the mountains and which was once so hostile that British soldiers were ordered to ride two on each horse  --  one looking forward and one looking backward ? to lessen the danger of ambush . EVENING POST The Land of Look-Behind in the Cockpit Mountains is uncharted on maps of Jamaica , but it is inhabited by the Maroons , descendants of slaves who long ago escaped and set up their own community . Various attempts by Spanish and British soldiers to conquer the Maroons were repulsed and in 1842 , after abolition of slavery , they were granted self-government and all the rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kingston government , managing their own affairs in every way , except that Maroons accused of murder are turned over to the Jamaica courts for trial . Visitors are seldom welcomed by the Maroons , who have lived for generations in almost complete isolation in their remote mountain towns . Some time ago a professor of anthropology from a famous American college visited the West Indies to study the influence of primitive African customs and , after a long period of negotiation , was granted permission to visit a Maroon * * * * * * * * * * village and witness their dancing . In great excitement he made the trip by horseback and on foot and , notebook in hand , settled himself at dusk in the village square to study the tribal ceremonies . There , at a signal given by the headman , the dancers gathered in the light of a fire and sedately executed an English quadrille that had been the last word in colonial society when their forebears escaped to the hills . In sharp contrast to the isolation of the Maroons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  just fifty miles across the island from Kingston ? enthusiastically welcome visitors to the new Gold Coast of the Caribbean , where the sand is powder fine and silvery white on many beaches . The tourist industry in Jamaica actually began about half a century ago on the northeastern corner of the island , where the United Fruit Company built the Titchfield Hotel on a knoll above Port Antonio and there entertained rich and distinguished guests from New York . The area probably holds some kind of world record of tropical beauty spots per square mile , but , after flourishing briefly , it fell on evil days and has only recently been rediscovered by tourists and deep-sea-fishing enthusiasts . Most famous of the beauty spots is the Blue Lagoon , an inlet which has a depth so great that it has never been measured and a color so intense that it has never been matched by the many February 9 , 1952 artists who have painted it . Hollywood camera experts who have made tests along the coast for the filming of Robinson Crusoe in color describe the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them  --  Charles Rosher ? was so entranced that he has started building a home in a new winter residential area centered around the San San Beach Club . Port Antonio also boasts a unique sport known as " rafting on the Rio Grande . " This is an unusual journey of several hours down the river on long , narrow rafts made of bamboo trees and originally used to transport bananas to the docks . Poled by sinewy natives , the rafts slither over the many rapids and slide around rock-filled bends on a trip that is usually interrupted for a swim and a picnic supper before floating on down to the sea by moonlight . Although Port Antonio was a pioneer resort , the tourist business was an insignificant side line in Jamaica until the 1920 's , when it began to assume aspects of a major industry along the shores of a great turquoise bay on the northwestern corner of the island . In early colonial days , the surrounding countryside abounded in wild hogs , and the little settlement at the water 's edge was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butter Bay , or Lard Bay . The English later corrupted the name to Montego Bay , and today it is often referred to simply as MoBay . The beginning of prosperity in Montego Bay was a hole in the ground , discovered by three local physicians . The hole led into a cave in a cliff beside the beach , and the three doctors used to descend into the cave each morning and swim in the bay . It later became a popular spot , and many persons believed the warm water of the bay benefited their health , possibly because they were swimming at . " the doctors ' cave . " Eventually one of the doctors , J. Alexander McCatty , bought the beach and deeded it to trustees to form a bathing club . Thus Doctor 's Cave Beach Club became the hub of a campaign started in the early 1920 's by Walter Fletcher and other local businessmen to attract tourists . Today the village ? with its own airport and such handsome hotels as the Casa Blanca and Sunset Lodge  --  has grown to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay is now a colorful winter meeting place for London 's Mayfair , New York 's caf ? society , Europe 's international set and a sprinkling of royalty . The surrounding hills are dotted with winter residences of prominent Britons and Americans , and the resort hotels crowded along the beach are so popular that some 3000 persons were turned away last season for lack of accommodations . Strangely enough , Montego Bay enjoyed almost a monopoly of tourist trade on the northern coast for a couple of decades , although the whole shore line is cluttered with handsome beaches and backed by high green hills . Shaw Park , a historic manor house converted to a resort high on a hillside where many waterfalls foam down through terraced gardens , was and still is a popular spot . And the famous Good Hope Ranch , near the town of ' Falmouth , took a limited number of guests each season . Good Hope , settled in 1744 , once had 3500 slaves in its fields and , under management of an American , Howard Thompson , is now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of a dude ranch . But otherwise ( Continued on Page 48 ) ( ( : ont ' et , from Page 46 ) the north coast showed very little interest in tourists until after World War II . Then several things happened . The Kingston government enacted laws designed to encourage construction of resort hotels by authorizing liberal tax exemptions and permitting importation of materials and supplies from the dollar zone . Wealthy Britons , seeking some economic haven from the taxminded London government , suddenly discovered unsuspected virtues  --  and certain financial advantages  --  in the Caribbean colony and began making substantial investments in homes and property . E. A. Issa &; Bro. got into the hotel business . In a way , the latter development was the most important.The Issas had bought the Myrtle Bank Hotel , in Kingston , during the war , when it was a bargain . They knew nothing about hotels , but Issa 's energetic son , Abe , plunged into the business with enthusiasm under the guidance of the Myrtle Bank 's able manager , Sam Levy . What business needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot in the arm , and that 's what Abe and Sam gave it . They organized " Know Jamaica " tours , inviting large groups of American editors and businessmen to the island and filling them with fine food , excellent rum and glowing accounts of the advantages of a vacation in the Caribbean . They were indefatigable hosts who knew all the answers , could play the piano for a barbershop quartet or demonstrate the intricacies of the rumba . They also got results , and the " Yankee dollahs " began flowing into the island at a faster rate during the winter-resort season . Abe Issa picked out a sandy beach near the village of Ocho Rios , on the central north coast , and built a new resort hotel which he called the Tower Isle for no reason in particular . To make the name stick , he also built a tower of undistinguished architectural elegance on a little island off the beach . Most important , however , was the fact that Issa abandoned all the wellestablished British ideas of resort hotels and built the Tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the beach , a terrace for dancing every night , plenty of calypso bands and a week-end night club on the roof . Such blatant appeal to American tourists shook the crusty surface of the island 's resort business , but Issa went still further and instituted lower rates for-the summer months in an unprecedented move to ? keep operating the year round . In the next two years , Tower Isle was admired , resented , imitated and , from time to time , sneered at , but it was also a whale of a success . Hotels began springing up all along the north coast , and speculators asked as much as $7000 for an unimproved acre of sandy beach . In no time at all , there were such establishments as the Silver Sands Beach Club , with a group of handsome villas on the dunes ; the Jamaica Inn , sporting a remarkable shade of blue paint called " plumbago , " after a local flower ; the Silver Seas , where towering palm trees grow up through the lobby roof ; the Sans Souci , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , and Columbus Inn , perched on the hills over a beach where the discoverer of America stepped ashore . All last winter this new Gold Coast buzzed with a record number of tourists , and moat of the hotels joined the Tower Isle in staying open for a cut-rate summer season . Such an influx of tourist ? dollars had an important effect on the economy of Kingston and of Jamaica generally , but it also prompted some people to worry whether the island 's primitive beauty and native charm will soon be spoiled by the onrush of modern civilization . The answer is : not likely . The Jamaican peasant is friendly , but not easily changed or impressed by the mechanical age ? not even by the biggest and most modern transocean air liners that land regularly on the level ground where he used to graze his livestock . Any doubt on this point was resolved at the height of last winter 's season by a revealing advertisement inserted in the newspapers by the exasperated director of civil aviation . " Notice is hereby given , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other such animals found straying in ... the aerodromes will be destroyed and the owners punished . "
