Three generations of Australians have been delighted and appalled by the salty character of a tiny , terrible-tempered politician whose rallying cry , " What the blithering blazes ! " , once tinkled the glass chandeliers of Versailles , made Lloyd George blanch , Woodrow Wilson freeze , and Clemenceau laugh . William Morris ( " Billy " ) Hughes was born a Welshman , but ten years as a knockabout laborer in Australia had made him as indigenous as a kangaroo . When he became Australia 's World War I Prime Minister , the Anzacs draped a big slouch hat around his pint-sized head , dubbed him " Little Digger . " <P> He had been a sheep drover , navvy , gold prospector , ship 's cook , waiter , locksmith , umbrella mender , a seller of fried fish , and a spear-carrier in a touring production of Shakespeare 's Henry V when , some time in the 1880s he decided to " emerge from the murk and chaos and leap up on the stage of human affairs . " His stage was the toughest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborers ' union . Hobo life had given him chronic dyspepsia and affected his hearing , but he discovered a powerful voice , tuneless , yet penetrating enough , as he himself said , " to peel the bark off a gum tree , " or " galvanize ten dead bullocks to a trot . " A gnomelike figure ( 5 ft. tall , under 100 lbs. ) , among the muscular wharf lumpers he was said to be " too deaf to listen to reason , too loud to be ignored , and too small to hit . " He was soon representing the waterfront in the New South Wales Parliament . <P> Fire &; Comprehension . Colonial Australia , aspiring to nationhood , was full of political slogans , such as " One man , one vote . " Billy improved on this : " One bloody man , one bloody vote , " he told his electors . He wrote a pamphlet , The Case for Labor , and rode with the Labor Party into the first Federal Parliament in 1901 . <P> To improve his parliamentary technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played records of the speeches of Britain 's Victorian Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone , was soon throwing such high-caliber cliches at the Opposition as " Sword of Damocles " and " Bed of Procrustes . " On one such occasion the Speaker of the House , a sensitive man , collapsed , crying with his dying breath : " Dreadful , dreadful ! " <P> Billy was national head of three trade unions : the wharf laborers , the transport workers and the seamen . He talked like a radical , but by 1910 he was already demanding that Australia should have its own army &; navy , and making speeches about the menace of Japan . That year , the Labor Party formed its first majority government , a cabinet consisting of two miners , a wharf lumper , a building worker , a hatter , a compositor , an engine driver and , of course , Billy Hughes . The cabinet split over World War I , and Hughes formed a national coalition government , pledged to aid Britain " to the last man and the last shilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
