After his defeat in last fall 's election , Michigan 's Democratic Senator Blair Moody , long the Washington correspondent for Detroit 's News , told friends he would like to start a newspaper " if I had $10 million . " <P> Last week Moody 's wistful hope seemed less of a pipe dream . With a syndicate of well-heeled and well-connected backers of predominantly Democratic leanings , Moody took a 15-year lease on Detroit 's Michigan Rotary Printing Co. , which has been printing a profitable 800,000-copy Shopping News , and several weeklies . Its modern presses could easily print a daily newspaper of either 32 or 48 pages . Reported cost of the lease ( with an option to buy ) : $250,000 . <P> That was a far cry from $10 million . But Moody 's backers included some who could doubtless raise that much or more . Most prominent : Mrs. Paul Hoffman , wife of the ex-ECAdministrator , now back at Studebaker , and Roger Stevens , Michigan real-estate potentate who engineered the $25 million purchase of Manhattan 's Empire State Building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as Bernard Baruch 's secretary , Miss Mary Boyle , and W. Averell Harriman 's protege , Philip Stern , research director of the Democratic National Committee , were possibly stand-ins for bigger money . Detroit , which already has three newspapers ( the locally owned News , Hearst 's Times and Jack Knight 's Free Press ) , buzzed with speculation over whether Moody and his backers would dare to start a new one . Moody had previously made offers to buy the Times and the Free Press , was turned down by both . At week 's end , he was looking over the small-town Michigan dailies .
