The Federal Court in Manhattan 's Foley Square had not been so lively since Estes Kefauver interviewed Frank Costello . A House Judiciary subcommittee , holding hearings on monopolistic practices in the broadcasting industry last week , wound up testimony from leading tunesmiths , lyric writers and librettists . Upstaging Committee Chairman Emanuel Celler were Librettists Alan Jay ( My Fair Lady ) Lerner , Oscar ( South Pacific ) Hammerstein II , Dorothy ( I Ca n't Give You Anything But Love , Baby ) Fields and Otto ( Roberta ) Harbach ; Composer Stanley ( What a Difference a Day Made ) Adams , Occasional Songwriter Billy ( Barney Google ) Rose . Their statements were all designed to show that they and many of their famous colleagues were being put out of business by the organization known as Broadcast Music , Inc . ( BMI ) . <P> The arguments all go back to the fact that air is free and music in the air is fleeting . Composers could almost always collect cash for sheet music and later for recordings , but collecting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past generation the American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers ( ASCAP ) has been handling such collections , the largest share of them in the form of flat annual fees from broadcasting stations , which nowadays amount to as much as $18 million a year . The bite was painful , and in 1939 broadcasters raised the cry of " monopoly " against ASCAP , got together and formed a rival agency , BMI . The two have been scrapping ever since , e.g. , 33 ASCAP composers are now suing BMI for $150 million . <P> Songwriters ' Case . The accusations brought in unsworn testimony by the ASCAPotentates : 1 ) BMI ( which is owned by 600 broadcasters , including all major networks ) owns or subsidizes more than 1,000 music publishers and through them has influence over rising entertainers ; 2 ) broadcasters also have a heavy finger in the record pie through RCA Victor ( related to NBC ) and Columbia ( a CBS subsidiary ) ; 3 ) wherever possible , the stations plug BMI tunes , ignore ASCAP tunes on the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it ) " the public selects its favorites from the music which it hears , and does not miss what it does not hear . " One method , testified Songwriter Adams , was in the form of memos to radio stations , saying : " This is a BMI number-meaning it is your own music . Be careful of the other side of this disk . It is not a BMI tune . " <P> The result , claimed ASCAPers , has been the rapid lowering of public taste in music-and the rise of rock ' n ' roll . Said Veteran Librettist Harbach , 83 : " The greatest melodies of the past would never have had a chance to reach the public if they were written now instead of then . Would Smoke Gets in Your Eyes be allowed by broadcasters to be heard instead of Be-Bop-a-Lula ? Could Indian Love Call penetrate the air waves which are flooded with Houn ' Dog ?
