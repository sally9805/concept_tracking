" Mr. Faubus has baldly drawn the line between defiance of the law and orderly adjustment of our difficulties , " said the Arkansas Gazette two days before the Arkansas Democratic primary last week . " In effect , he is asking the people of Arkansas to endorse armed rebellion against the United States . " <P> Orval Faubus got his endorsement . In a landslide that rattled the nation 's teeth - much as they were rattled when the troops landed in Little Rock last September-Faubus won the primary , thus is slated to be the second man ever to spend three terms in the Arkansas Governor 's chair . In a record turnout he defeated two opponents , won a historic 68% of the vote , carried every one of the 75 counties , from the rich , black Delta , heavily populated with Negroes , to the northwestern mountain counties , where Negroes make up only a tiny minority of the population . <P> As the returns cascaded into his headquarters in Little Rock 's Marion Hotel , Faubus paraded his pleasant smile before the Dixie-singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't leave now . Governor , " cried a hanger-on as Faubus started off to make a victory statement somewhere else . " Ike 's on the phone . " Faubus ' cocky answer brought cackles and rebel yells out of the sultry night . " Tell him to call back later , " he drawled . <P> Yankee Go Home . Orval Faubus ' two opponents had tried first to run against the third-term issue , found that voters had accepted the calculated Faubus definition of the campaign : show the " outsiders , " including President Eisenhower and " the Yankee press , " that Arkansas does not want integrated schools . With the courage to win or lose on horse sense , Chancery Judge Lee Ward of Paragould ( pop . 10,000 ) grimly contrasted his own law-and-order segregationism with the " bullet and bayonet approach " taken by Faubus . " Orval Faubus stands today on the brink of treason , " said he in an election eve TV speech . " Is it war between Arkansas and the United States ? " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the people of Arkansas a happy and prosperous administration " and went back to his bench . <P> Around the South , politicians felt the rumbling landslide , scurried to get with it . Georgia 's Governor Marvin Griffin , who had pushed Faubus toward making a big issue of integration at Central High School last fall , weighed in quickly with an expected telegram on the " splendid victory . " Mississippi Democratic Chairman Bidwell Adams wired : " Northern Democratic leaders should scrape the wax out of their ears . " Louisiana 's Governor Earl Long thought it was " a pity there are not more people like him at the helms of government . " Florida 's LeRoy Collins saw the results as reflecting " overwhelming resentment " against federal troops ; North Carolina 's Luther Hodges said they were a measure of the " intensity of feeling " against Ike 's dispatch of troops . Virginia 's J. Lindsay Almond Jr. , who may soon decide for law or violence in communities ( at least three , one pending ) facing school-integration orders effective next month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
