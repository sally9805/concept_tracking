KRISHNA IN THE LOCATION A Story by Marguerite Pereira Drawing by Edward illaffeo P LEASE ma'am . " Mrs. Golding looked up from the dove-gray letter she was writing to her best friend in England . " Please ma'am , excuse me ma'am . Can the ma'am borrow me one pound and do me another favor also ? " " What is it , Greta ? " Mrs. Golding tried to forget about the letter she was constructing . As she always told her husband and friends , if only you tried to understand the wants of the Natives , it was much less likely that they would want to take advantage of you . " Can the ma'am give me tomorrow off for moving ? " " Moving ? Moving where , Greta ? " she asked in her most reasonable tone of voice as though it were a purely ethnologic-frontier question . A year ago , fresh from home , she had accorded all favors without question , but there had since been so many telegrams , summoning the servants to a dying father or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she now gave herself time to think . Greta wiped her hands on her starched apron though they were already dry . She said in her rich , fruity voice that sounded ready to break into one of those high , rhythmically sustained chants that came through the dining-room window at washing-up time , " Did n't the ma'am read that all the Native 's population has got to clear out of our location tomorrow ? The government 's making white area there . First they clearing the Natives , then later on afterwards , they clearing the Indians and coloreds . " She waited without anxiety . She had learned in ten years of service that it was almost beholden on people who had servants to be unpredictable . People who liked the blacks to be quiet and respectful could accuse you of cheeky , obstinate silence , and although Mrs. Golding liked her to be friendly and explain what she wanted she had once heard her telling her husband that Greta was getting too clever . Mrs. Golding finished the sentence she was writing " . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oxalis are delicately thriving . " " Rut it 's your day off today , Greta . Ca n't you move today ? " She played for time . " I know ma'am , but tomorrow the government is sending trucks to move us . Today I can jes get everything ready . " " Ca n't your husband get a day off from the factory ? " " No ma'am . " Mrs. Golding gazed out of the window past the aquamarine swimming pool and the rows of cannas to the golden privet hedge which shielded them from the garage and the servants ' quarters . Why the girl should need a hovel miles out of Johannesburg when she had a comfortable room and shower and permission for her husband to visit her --  ! It was probably something the Natives had , some tribal thing to retain a foothold among their own people , which was beyond her . " You 'll still be sleeping here every night , Greta ? " " Oh yes , yes of cuss ma'am . " But if the trucks were being sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that there was only one very small shop in the new place . They would get bread and tea as soon as they arrived in Greenacres , but afterwards they must supply themselves . She knew that the interchange was over . No further explanation was needed . " All right , Greta . We 've got visitors tomorrow night , but you 'll have to tell Joseph to ask Peter to help him . " She could not be sure that Greta was not taking unwarranted advantage , but then that was the case even with friends sometimes . Look how Girlie had made her drive six miles out of her way yesterday , and she did not like to discriminate . " I 'll give it to you now before I forget . " Her bag was next to the inkwell , She always carried it with her , for although she hated suspicion it was just as well not to tempt them . She rubbed the note between thumb and third finger like a teller to make sure it was single . Greta received it in cupped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from satisfactory , that the tension was steadily mounting . Whole Native areas were being moved still further out- She did not know quite where and had to finish her sentence at " out . " As her pen formulated the situation in neat , unplastic characters the residue of never being quite sure that they were not up to something drained from her , down her arm and out of the concealed gold nib . A T SIX o'clock Sita , the daughter of the Indian storekeeper at the location , had finished sweeping the Hoot . She opened the green door of the little store and stood half outside so that she had a full view of the street oneither side in case a policeman should appear . On the right at intervals of every five houses stood a truck and all along the red-earth pavement were chairs on top of tables , crates of plates and glasses , and stoves , an occasional Welsh dresser with the scalloped oilcloth or newspaper still tacked to it . Without the iron beds and mattresses it would have seemed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds and some anonymous bundles on top of them to prove that something other than eating and cooking had gone on behind the iron and brick facades . Not really , because there were even three or lour small wardrobes , towering landmarks of prosperity , a few sewing machines , fruits of effort and industry , but the Natives provided by the municipality lifted them onto the trucks with regard only for weight and size . Sita plaited her thick , dark hair loosely . She would do it properly after her bath , before praying . She called to her mother to come and see . Mrs. Ramalal came out from the back room and draped her sari over her head to confront the crowded street . She shook her head . " By tonight not one will be left , just us and the Chinee next door . " She did not count the Mohammedans down the street or the handful of coloreds or the Tamil family . She shook her head slowly and went to stand behind the counter . Sita stood alone , her arms crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chest felt tight as though she wanted to cry . It was not really because the Natives were moving , not exactly because they would be almost alone in an empty street tonight , not only because there would he no more business and they did not know yet where they were going . She told herself that none of these three things was important because God would look after them . Even the Natives , he would look after them . Even the ants . She could trust Bhagwan , not only that he would look after them but that everything that was happening was right . Still she felt heavy . When she saw big Jacob , who always came in drunk and stole a banana when her father was at market , she felt nearer to tears . He was peeling a banana now . He carefully broke off half of it for his little boy , who was naked front the waist down , and he ate the rest himself . She looked down at her black patent shoes . She should he wearing her old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ llhagwan knew . A tear fell on the toe . She wiped her cheek with her sari and glanced sideways into the shop to 60 KRISHNA IN THE LOCATION see if her mother was observing her but Mrs. Ramalal was folding a pan leaf . Sita looked at the Hindu calendar . Her father had marked today with a red penciled ring . Above it Krishna , his body a beautiful bluish color , played with his shepherd 's pipe . His long black hair framed his face gracefully . Bhagwan 's greatest devotees were always most sorely tried . When Krishna came to earth even his beloved Arjun had undergone trials and tribulations and moments of despair . She uncrossed her arms to fetch a Coca-Cola from the fridge for their first customer , a Native taxi-driver . " Drink Coca-Cola in darkest Africa and feel as refreshed and cool as a white bass , " he suggested and carried his bottle out as though it were the torch on the Statue of Liberty . What of the kings who had been deprived of their kingdoms , and the hosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persecuted and still they clung only to God ? What was happening to her was nothing . She unfolded her arms to get a box of Rinso down for her mother who was making up an order . Behind the Rinso was the new Coca-Cola calendar that the delivery man had given them yesterday . She was face to face with the suntanned American god and goddess in bathing costume who were never afflicted by heat or flies or trials or want , yet she was lucky because she had Krishna . She got down from the shelf and dusted her hands against each other . Though even they had their God on the planks of wood to . pray to . Bhagwan manifested himself in as many forms as he was called upon and all those forms were one . She went to stand by the door again . Jacob had just walked past and thrown his banana peel on the steps . You bleddy fool . Someone can slip ! " she shouted in an angry voice . A runny-nosed pickaninny came and held out an empty lime-juice bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one grayish , crusty leg . " Bonsella , " he demanded . " Yes , even last day you do n't forget bonsella . " She gave him not one but two overflowing hands of popcorn so that he left a trail of manna behind him . More and more Natives came in for last-minute provisions for the exodus , and Sita was kept busy between watching at the door and getting things down for her mother . It was a few minutes to seven , official opening time , when they ran out of mealie meal . Mrs. Ramalal went to the back for fresh supplies and Sita came andstood behind the counter . She was so busy with the change and thinking that it would never be like this again that she did not see Greta put her list down on the counter . " Whose this ? " she asked . " No time to read today . " Then she looked up into Greta 's broad face . " Sorry . 1 did n't see . " " All right . I can see you busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . It was a long moment , agreeable and sad . " Last time I 'm buying here . Hau ! it makes me feel too much sad . " Sita always exchanged a few words with this big , cheerful black woman .

A STORY cheeky and kept her house and children cleaner than some of the Indians , but today she felt constrained . She smiled shyly , " But it 's not so bad in Greenacres also . The houses are big . With bathroom I hear . " She felt heavy again . Ram Ram Ram she repeated mentally . " It 's not this . I know the houses is nice . But even we moving into a palace , a person feels homesick . " Sita brought down two quarter-pound packets of green-label tea and laid them on the counter . " Yes , we also feeling funny . " She shook her plait back . Greta suddenly leaned forward in a parting gesture : " Some people trying to be clever . They saying this moving is measures to prevent us buying land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breasts jogged in her spotless blouse with its fall of white lace . " But we too poor to own land any view you take of the matter , so why cry about spilt milk ? " She shook the tea into the bottom of her old shopping bag . " I 'm homesick yes , but it cuts both ways . We can be pleased with what we getting . " " Yes , " agreed Sita , This girl was a lot more sensible than those irreligious Tamils up the road . " Everything that comes is good . " She wrapped up the little pile of groceries in a newspaper and instead of dipping into the bonsella boxes she took a stick of licorice and a sucker from the penny jars . " Here , for your baby . " Greta put the palm of her hand up to her green head-scarf and smiled with broad delight . " Han ? Thank you ma'am . Thank you for your kindness and bless you . " Mrs. Ramalal waddled in and plunked the small bags of mealie meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sucker she asked excitedly in Hindi how they were going to eat tomorrow if Sita started handing the goods out . Sita shrugged her shoulders and went back to the door . The lorries were almost loaded . Nothing was easy here but it did not matter if only one could remember that it was the Lord 's play . At four minutes to seven she decided to go and have her ha ill . S H E took a pail of hot water from the stove and carried it with difficulty to the bathing cubicle in the back yard . When she had finished , she dressed in clean underclothes , underskirt , blouse , and sari and went to the tiny temple which was a corner of the bed-dining-room partitioned off by three heavy velvet curtains . She had hardly sat down before the pictures of Divine Mother , Shiva , and the other deities when she heard the sound of a truck pulling up the road . She wondered if they were leaving already but resisted the temptation of going to the window to see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and barely moving lips she prayed soundlessly . Ram Ram Ram Ram .... She wondered how silent it was going to be tonight , and how much strength she would have if the tsotsi-gangs broke in . At the thought of tsotsis and their malice a shiver ran through her . Ram Ram Ram . The invocation never stopped threading itself through her mind . " Sim ! Seee-ta . . . " Her mother 's call was so high and urgent she hastily joined her hands and sprang up . A white man , an Afrikaner , was standing next to Mrs. Ramalal in the shop . Greta stood in the corner with her face to the wall . She was crying with hunched shoulders . Sita stood dismayed . She asked what had happened , but she knew . The inspector had his little book out and they were going to be fined for selling before seven o'clock . " Is this your mother ? " Ile addressed Sita . " Yes . " She hung her head and lowered her eyes . " Well , she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sell anything to this girl before seven o'clock this morning , but I saw her coming down with her parcel . " He scanned his little book . " She had two quarter-pound packets of tea , three pounds ' mealie meal , two tins tomato paste , six pounds sugar , one stick of licorice , and one sucker . The time was five to seven . She was on her way home . First she said she bought these groceries yesterday . Afterwards she admitted buying them here this morning . " Greta began to hiccough audibly . " Sop open seven o'clock . " Mrs. Ramalal shook her head emphatically . Suddenly Sita jerked her head forward like Arjun engaging in battle . " Yes , she buy . Now what you do ? " " I 'll have to take your name and address . " The little notebook came up again . Inspector Visser caught the pencil which swung from it " Now who owns this business ? Whose name is it registered in ? " Sita thought of her father and how she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . " " Whirr is your father ? " This Dutchman with his sandy hair and freckled hands said everything with the minimum of effort as though he were saving his energy for better things . " He 's gone market , " Sita answered impersonally and stared sullenly at the calendars . She added , without knowing why , " What you think ? 62 KRISHNA IN THE LOCATION You think he 's gone dancing ? He get up at four o'clock to go market . " The young inspector let his arms fall patiently and carefully to his sides . " I 'll give you dancing . Now you 'd better keep a civil tongue in your head if you don want to be in any more trouble than you 're in already . No additional information . " He brought the little book up again . His words had a ponderous disconcern that did not match his youth . Mrs. Ramalal , not daring to interfere , kept on pulling her sari further forward over her head as though to efface her completely . It looked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke out again , " You don want information but I give you for bonsella . " G RETA turned round in alarm . " Please Missus be careful . Just talk nice . They many ways of killing a cat . " " I mus speak . Wait . You see all those people standing there . They all got to move from they house . It 's your people doing this . Since three o'clock this morning they waiting for trucks . Now they must go new place . No shop . You think they must go without food also . You think they not suffering enough we must refuse them food . You think people don get hungry because they got dark skin ? " Mrs. Ramalal asked excitedly what was happening . Hcr eyes were almost hidden from view . Sita ignored her and looked straight into the Hushed face of this Dutchman as she had never looked at an Indian man . " And we tomorrow . What we do ? To who we sell ? Indian can stay but how he eat ? " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And still we must pay twenty-pound fine . " Her voice was neither angry nor loud . It was just that everything was coming to an end today so she might as well put an end to her silence too . " The law 's the law . You broke it . I did n't . So I ca n't help all thatl " There was no doubt in his mind about this . No room had been left for such a thing in his training . It was not even as if he despised the Coolies as much as most . He squinted down at his little book . The three non-European women stood dispersed in the small store watching him numbly when with violent unexpectedness , from the back room , came the blast of Indian music . . . drums pounding , cymbals crashing . Sita 's little sister had chosen this moment to play a spirited devotional song on the gramophone . Mrs. Ramalal lifted the curtain just behind her and stuck her head through the little opening into the bedroom . The child , curled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and threats and the gramophone continued to call ecstatically for Krishna to come and show his face and lotus feet . Young Visser 's brows drew together . The music was weird , like too many of the things he came across in this job . Like the smell of coconut oil from the girl 's hair . Mrs. Ramalal had moved swiftly into the bedroom . Through the opening he watched the mother drag the child from the bed and the blue candlewick bedspread with her . Then she clouted the child 's car . It was exactly the same backhand movement that his wife had used on Piet at breakfast this morning for spitting out his egg . He must tell his wife about it . She might get touchy , if she misunderstood . Absentmindedly he began to take out a cigarette , remembered that he never smoked on the job , put the packet back in his pocket and stroked his throat . " Ag Wat ! " he thought . " I 'm not going to fine these people . They 're in enough trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book and slip it into the inner breast pocket of his suit . The movement brought his bony , freckled wrists right out of their frayed cuffs . " I 'm not reporting you this time but don let it happen again . Don forget this is an exception . " He pronounced it " agsaption . " Ile blinked rapidly in surprise at what he had just done . It was certainly not what he was paid for . He had not yet recovered when Sita saw him standing there , his shoulders framed by the tins of boot polish , his head by the card with the spare parts fur primus stoves . There was a blue light coming from the shelves behind him . For a space nobody trusted him not to take his book out again , then Greta clapped a hand to either thigh , bent her knees like a cheer leader , and opened her mouth . " Han ! Haul Hau ! Thank you Massa for your kindness . " Sita went behind the counter and brought back a Hindu calendar with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkey deity . She rolled it up as though it were a diploma and presented it silently . Visser rubbed his neck . " I ca n't read those numbers . " " Take ! " insisted Sita . " Take , " echoed Mrs. Ramalal . " Picture for God . Hanuman monkey love God too much , " she explained sagely . A STORY BY MARGUERITE PEREIRA 63 For the first time they all smiled together . Mrs. RamaJai let her sari lie on her shoulders where it had slipped during the bedroom scene . She shook with laughter . " My English is broke , " she managed between two gusts . " The only thing that 's broke is the law . " The Inspector hit his palm with the calendar as though punishing himself . Greta began to cackle . They all laughed . They laughed so much that Sita 's little sister put her tear-stained face through the opening to stare at them while the needle lifted from the Last groove and sank to rest . M R S . Golding took the salad bowls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two guests and her husband were waiting found the table . " Really you 're going to get a putrid dinner , " she assured them again . " But , darling , this looks delicious , " Girlie Meyers said . They all sat down as she waved her arms at them and sat down herself . " Well , this I did myself , but I had to leave most of the rest to Joseph . He burnt the risotto . " She grimaced cynically . " 1 ca n't really blame him . He was all alone . " " Greta got the day off to move , " rematled Mr. Golding , taking it up . He raised his eyebrows and passed the rolls . Mrs. Golding unfurled her napkin and looked down at her hands as they rested on the starched , immaculate linen for a moment . " I would also have wanted the day off under the circum-stances . " " It 's unlikely that you should ever be in the position of being herded off to an area miles away from your work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being consulted , " remarked Basil Meyers , buttering his roll and watching his host uncork a bottle of Nedehurg Stein . " What do you say , Bob ? I ca n't help wondering sometimes how those poor bloody wretches feel about it when I read the paper . " " May not be far off from us , that sort of treatment , " grunted Bob Golding as though he were ready for his share of suffering . He decanted a little wine into his own glass and rinsed it rotund his tongue . " Ask Betty what they think . I must admit I can never make out what they 're bloody well thinking myself . The other day I told Creta that she should n't bother with a house at all . I offered to let her have the kids here . She looked at me as though she had a toothache . . .. This stuff 's not bad .
