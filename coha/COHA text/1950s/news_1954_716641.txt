txt WASHINGTON , Nov. ** President was resuming his role as Chief Executive ' of the Government and representative ' of all the people and was marking the end of his activity as leader of one party 's campaign , when he made his moderate and . conciliatory comment this week on the outcome of the Congressional elections . In view of the transfer of control of the legislative machinery from the Republicans to the Democrats by the voting decision of Nov. 2 , the President 's comment was good tactics in several respects . He will remain primarily responsible for the leadership of the Government and the people until Jan. 20 , 1957 , and therefore his move to propose peaceful coexistence with the Democrats in Congress was clear- ' ly in that official interest . The President 's relaxed manner and moderation of speech seem to have made a happy impression on the Democrats as well as on general public opinion , and that was also in the national interest . Finally , his modification of the campaign 's end prophecy that any division of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing public business to a partisan " cold war " for the next two years appears further to have placated the Democrats , and have been generally and admiringly received as another proof that the President is a " big man . " Professionals at a Loss But there was also as tangible an element of caution in President Eisenhower 's discussion of how he would face the uncertain political future . It was matched by ' catitious comments from the leaders , and the reason was the same on both sides . This reason is uncertainty among both the Republican and Democratic professionals over the , fundamental and future meaning of an elect tion in which local and personal considerations played large and diverse parts . The professionals just do n't know where they are at in public estimation , except for the fact that the Democrats will probably organize both the House and Senate , or where the parties will lee in 1856 . And so , from the I resident down , those who will be principals in making the record of the Eighty-fourth Congres 's ? on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choice of the next President are delicately feeling their way into the minds of the people . The record of the Eightyfourth Congress is only a " possibility " as the paramount issue in the next campaiglibecause events ? war or depression as horrid examples  --  could displace it . But as of now the product of this Congress and the circumstances in which it is manufactured compose the prospective basis of the next electoral debate . Democratic Responsibility The party politicians will have this uppermost in mind when the Eighty-fourth Congress meets and the first interparty sparring begins . Whether or not recounts , tnd human casualties leave the Democrats in control of the Senate , the margin will be so small that even a ? solidified party ? which neither major party is ? will have to exchange internal group concessions to retain it . Moreover , marginal control of the Senate by the Democrats in addition to their working majority in . the House will set down the Eighty-fourth officially as a " Democratic Congress , " and by the law of politics they will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads hoped to avoid this problem for the Democrats by the emergence of the Republicans from the election with a Senate majority of one  --  preferably , and in a sense artificially ; contributed by the Vice President in the exercise of his one legislative power under the Constitution  --  and it can develop into an advantage for the President , With that plus the veto , which in a Congress so closely divided can be expected almost always to prevail , the President remains in a strong political situation . President 's Course How can he make the most of it in what he conceives to be the best interest of the country ( an interest which the Republicans naturally hope will prove to be generally not hurtful to their own ) ? The full list of answers to that question will not be available until the Eighty-fourth Congress adjourns . But it already is tentatively indicated that ; ( 1 ) The President for an indefinite period will keep his own party and the Democrats guessing whether he would accept renomination . This leaves him in possession of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence would be greatly damaged if the Republicans knew they could not once more transmute his , popularity into votes , The Democrats would challenge him more boldly . ( 2 ) The President will review both his general and specific proposals on a regular basis with the Democratic as well as with the Republican leaders before submitting them to Congress . This covers the generalities of his State of the Union messages and the specifications of basic bills he will ask Congress to approve . The purpose is to get as much of the substance of legislation as he can by the give-andtake method . It wo n't be long before the President has a practical illustration that this method works only to a point , and that nothing he feels able to give will induce the Democrats  --  and some Repoblicans ? to take the remainder , Without Partisanship ( 3 ) The President plans to avoid any show o ( partisanship , for which on occasion  --  such as when he gives big jobs to Democrats ? the Republicans are sure to experience great grief , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his charge that they are being wholly partisan in their resistance . This avoidance will not be difficult for President Eisenhower , whom partisanship fits awkwardly ( as his campaign activities demonstrated ) . And if the Democratic leaders resist him on projects which express his " middle-of-the-road " political philosophy  --  public power , taxation and farm price supports , as instances ? he can probably count on more Democratic defections than Republican desertions . ( 4 ) The President can he expected to compromise more than ever on details which some will classify as principles . He is an old hand at this bttsiness , having commanded mixed Allied armies in the field and in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , and he thinks he Can perform it as well in the context of politics even with the next Presidency as the stake , He is fully aware of the magic of his personality , which he will turn on the Democrats with augmented force , and lie does not see in the election returns any considerable loss of his popularity . The sum may be a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than most political honeymoons do .
