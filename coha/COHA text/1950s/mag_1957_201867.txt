OFF LIMITS ( 466 pp. ) - Hans Habe-Frederick Fell ( $4.95 ) . <P> This book might have borrowed its title more appropriately from Noel Coward 's World War II ditty , Do n't Let 's Be Beastly to the Germans . Though Novelist Habe ( real name : Jean Bekessy ) is Hungarian-born , he peddles the familiar made-in-Germany apologia that most Germans were as innocent as the children of Hamelin town , and that only the wicked Pied Piper of Berchtesgaden seduced them into evil ways . More surprising . Novelist Habe , who rose to the rank of major in the U.S. Army , was decorated , and served with the occupation forces , argues that the Americans have acted as louts and barbarians preying on a helpless , suffering people . In this false equation , miscarriages of justice such as the imprisonment of non-Nazis or the cavalier requisitioning of German homes are treated as the vicious equivalent of murdering 6,000,000 Jews . <P> In Germany Off Limits is already a bestseller . The crass coating of sex and corn on this propaganda pill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bygones , may make the book almost as successful in the U.S. , although it is rubbish . Off Limits mounts hundreds of unrelated , postage-stamp vignettes of the occupation years 1945 to 1951 side by side . Amid the meandering plots and subplots , readers will meet the following unattractive Americans : an intelligence major who forms a sado-masochistic liaison with the Ile Koch-like widow of a concentration-camp commandant , a Jewish captain who allows a German family to stay on in the home he has improperly requisitioned in order to seduce the daughter of the house , a well-meaning colonel who quits rather than carry out the conflicting orders of Washington politicos who all " have rocks in their heads , " assorted privates and corporals who force the imprisoned wives of erstwhile Nazi bigwigs to lick the paint off Hitler portraits . The Germans , on the other hand , are almost all noble . <P> Author Habe seeks to temper his anti-Americanism with organ-tone laments about history being bigger than both peoples and no nation being fit to judge another . Americans need not fear criticism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. can and does commit . But this book does not really offer such an accounting . Instead , it offers Author Habe 's strange verdict that the U.S. , acting in good faith , has done more harm to Europe than the nation which , twice within a quarter-century , launched total war .
