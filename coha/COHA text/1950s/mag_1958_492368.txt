" Read it now l " I opened the envelope and pulled out a sheet of yellow paper . It was an interoffice memo from Arthur Jacobs to Warren Cowan , both of whom are partners in a Hollywood publicity lirm which was then handling my press rclatibns . I glanced over it , and the words jumped off the paper . Damone is singularly the most uncooperative client on our list .... He will occasionally condescend to give an hour to someone . . . . For some reason he handles himself improperly with the press . 1-k says the wrong things , he is uncontrollable , he complains about the Anny constantly in interviews . He hurts himself and makes himself look small with these comments .... He used to be liked by the press , but that 's not the case any longer .... It 's impossible to work with him . He frequently gives the impression that he is doing US a favor by talking to the press . There were other words even more galling , and I could feel my blood pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Milt said , " because there 's more . Your press agents are dropping you . They do n't want you for a client any more . even at six hundred dollars a month , and if that is n't a switch I never heard of one . Press agent tires star ! " I was sick . " What do I do now ? " I asked . " I do n't know , " Milt said , glumly . " Remember when I said you had everything ? I was wrong . Maybe you 'd better do something about it . " What could I do ? Psychoanalysis , perhaps ? I tried it once , and I was more confused than ever . Ask my friends for advice ? I have n't got a real friend in Hollywood . Quit show business ? I 've considered that , but I 'm not trained for anything else . Take a good look at myself and my messed-up life ? That might do it , and that 's why I 'm telling this story . In my lonely hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you will understand  --  I hear the echoes of the gossip about Vic Damone . Damone is an insecure problem child . . . . Delmont is ungrateful to those who helped him . . .. Damone is fat-headed and selfish . . . . Da-moor is afraid of losing his wife or his life or his career . . . . Damon ( turned down a Mike Wallace interview because he was afraid of what might come out . . . . Damone hairs the press and the . Irmy and his mother-in-law and everybody else , including himself . . . . Damone belongs to the underworld . And so on . Even Milt once said : " Vic could be on top of the world , but everywhere we turn there 's a guy who wants to kill him . " Long ago , when I was eighteen years old and just getting started , one of my counselors said : " Vic , you 're going into a brutal business . While you 're getting fan mail , signing autographs and having people slobber over you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wo n't even know you 're bleeding . " I was naive then , and full of beans . " I can handle guys like that , " I said . " No , you ca n't , " he said . " You 'll take it . and like it , and you 'll learn to keep your mouth shut when they take you apart . " He was right to a degree , and for years I followed his advice . But I can no longer keep still . There are too many things to straighten out , especially with people who think show business is a dream world of excitement and glamour , and who wish they could trade places with me . Tonight , as I sit in my living room and look down on the spangle of lights on the hillsand valleys below our house , I think of an evening in San Francisco , I was in the bar atop the Mark Hopkins Hotel with Ronnie Postal , a young friend who designs some of my stage clothes , and he said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 've gut the best view on the bay , but they might as well be dead . " Here in Beverly Hills I also have an enviable view , but there arc days when I , too , might just as well be behind bars  --  or dead . I purposely picked a house which is the last one on a dead-end street high in the hills . There is a strong steel fence around my property , and on the posts are sensitive amplifiers which will detect the presence of intruders . We have a tough German shepherd roaming the yard . A private policeman patrols the boundaries every hour throughout the night , in case there are snoopers or , worse , kidnapers who might think that a beautiful young movie star with a two-year-old boy would be an easy mark . " All you need now , " a visitor said recently , " is a gun tower and a solitary cell . If you 're lucky you 'll get out on parole someday . " I was n't sure whether he was kidding or whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say anything , but I was thinking : I 've already got a cell . ( Continued on Page 8i ) What a Mess I 've Made of Things ! ( Continued from Page 21 ) In my private prison there are guards who tell me where and what to sing . They advise me when to sleep and what to wear . They install an unlisted phone with a number that is guarded like a Pentagon secret . They filter my telephone calls , visitors and mail.Thcy protect me  --  or so I 'm told  --  against the hazards of hero worship , moochers , greedy relatives and women on the prowl . They watch my weight . They smuggle me in and out of restaurants , airplanes or theaters where I might be trapped by ordinary people . They grab tranquilizing pills for themselves the instant I say the wrong things to the press  --  and unfortunately I 've done that often . They have lawyers , doctors and press agents on tap for me , and they tell me what to do about my mother-in-law . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks with my name on them have to be signed by my business manager . I am allowed 5100 a week spending money , and if I 'm foolish enough to save any extra cash they take it away for taxes or some other expense . My life is insured for $250,000 , and when I get insomnia  --  all too frequently  --  they start losing sleep themselves . Once or twice , when they 've called me for sleeping late , with my phone cut off , I have said bitterly : Why should I get up earlier ? What have I got to get up for ? More headaches Aside from these few little restrictions I just mentioned , I am a free man . At least no one tells me what to think , and they have n't controlled my tongue , and perhapS that 's how the trouble began . It is true . I am sorry to say , that I have had trouble with newspaper and television reporters . Years ago a press agent said : " Vic , when you 're a celebrity there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't play ball with the columnists and the rest , they 'll murder you . " So I did n't play ball , at least by their rules , and they murdered me . And , honestly , this is the kind of dangerous game I do n't understand . A year or two ago , for instance . I was backstage with Dick Haymes at the Cocoanut Grove in Los Angeles , and there I encountered Florabel Muir , of the New York Daily News . I had married Pier Angeli not long before  --  her real name is Anna Maria Picrangeli  --  and t could n't have been happier . " How are you and Anna getting along ? " Florabel asked . " Fine , " I said . " Make you a bet , " she said , " that you do n't last another year with her . " I was stunned , and for a moment I thought she had n't said it . But she repeated the challenge , and before the argument was over I had angrily made a fifty-dollar bet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna and I had a baby , and were shopping for a larger house , I saw Florabel again . " Hey , how 's about my fifty bucks ? " I said . " Tell you what I 'll do , " she said . " I 'll double the bet for another year . " I walked away in a fury , and I have n't seen her since . Anna and I are still together , of course , and I never collected my bet . Looking back on that incident now , I can say to myself : Damone , you were a fool to blow your top . Like some other Hollywood reporters who do n't think much of real-life romance in Hollywood , Florabel loaded the question and took a shot in the dark . I lost my sense of humor , and perhaps word went around that I had a chip on my shoulder . I did n't want to quarrel with the press , but I was gun shy . Hy Gardner , of the New York Herald Tribune , who has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his split-screen television interviews , and I mulTed it again . " Vic , " he said , " do you remember making a statement that the only girl you would marry would be a Hollywood star with blond hair and blue eyes ? " This silly question threw me . I admit I might have said it when I was young and single and foolish . But that night millions of people , including Anna , were watching Hy and me . Anna is brown-eyed and a brunette . Anna is a woman , too , and she can be an explosive little volcano . She is sensitive , and I was sure her feelings would be hurt . I do n't remember what I said to Hy Gardner . I only know that I was steaming . Not long afterward Mike Wallace asked the William Morris Agency if I would sit still for the third degree on his controversial television hot seat . Knowing me , my agents naturally shuddered and said " No ! " I heard later that Mike was miffed , but I have begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably more afraid of myself . Wallace might have ground me up like hamburger , and I have since decided that if there is to be a public confessional I would rather handle it myself . The trouble with gossip  --  and printed gossip is a staple in the American diet  --  is not that it consists of whispers and rumors . In show business you live in a bird cage . There 's no place to hide , so you get used to the stares and the buzz of talk , and pretend you do n't care . Also , the press agents will tell you that if these items do n't kill you outright , they at least keep your name alive . The real trouble with gossip is not what people say  --  it 's what they leave out because they do n't have the facts . Most gossip is only half a truth . I remember one item in a New York column which read : " Vic Damonc has hired an ex-pug as a bodyguard . Mob trouble ? " This little b'ockbuster implied that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or both , and that I had mysterious underworld connections . It was one of those annoying half-truths . The facts about the ex-pug were that Producer Joe Pasternak had signed me to portray a boxer in a movie , and he suggested I ought to learn something about fist fighting . I engaged a professional trainer named Al Silvani , worked hard for six months , and finally asked Pasternak when the picture would start . " Oh , I thought you knew , " he said . " We 're not going to make that one , after all . " I kept Silvani with me for a year or more after that because I learned to like boxing , but he was certainly never a bodyguard . The explanation for those two damaging words " mob trouble " is n't quite so simple . There has been talk for some years that I got my start with gangster money , and that the underworld still owns " a piece " of me . Perhaps I had better go back to the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1928 . My parents , Rocco and Mamie . Farinola , never had much money , but they were n't poor enough to make up any romantic fiction for my biography . My father was an electrician who really had to squeeze his pay check to support me and my four sisters , and there was a time when he hopec would get into the business with him . I started in Alexander Hamilton Vocational High School with that in mind , but my heart ( Continued on Page 90 ) POST ( Cottrinued from l'agr 87 ) was n't in 11 . My mother taught piano and my father strummed a guitar , and with so much music at home they killed any interest I might have had in wires and fuse boxes . They had scraped up enough money so I could start voice lessons when I was about ten , and they recall that the first song I learned was You 're Driving Mc Crazy . There were limes later , I guess , when I did dust : them crazy . I has e often said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawled cut of the woodwork when I began making important money . I really did have a lot of relatives . Some were wonderful to rne , others often referred to me as Farinola 's Folly . " Those darn-fool singing lessons will break the old man yet , " they said . I began skipping climes at school , and I hung around the stage door at the Paramount on Times Square just to get a glimpse of Frankie Sinatra  --  who was headlining there with the Benny Goodman band  --  Bob Eberle , Glenn Miller , Tommy Dorsey and other artists working the stage shows . Eventually I got a part-time job as an usher , and occasionally I tilled in for one of the men who operated the backstage elevator . One evening I was lucky enough to he there when Perry Como stepped into the cage . " Mr. Como , " I said brashly , " I 'm a singer too . " Perry was humming to himself , and he nodded absent-mindedly , " Want to hear me sing ? " I said . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for a turndown . I knew I had him trapped and I rattled the shaft with a song called There Must Be a Way . Perry smiled , and patted me on the back . " You'se got the pipes , kid . " he said . " Stick with it . " A couple of nights later I was driving home with one of my cousins , Lou Capone , when his wife asked if I were still taking voice lessons . I said I was . " Yeah ? " she said . " Sing something . " Lou looked skeptical and his attitude burned me , and I sang one chorus of a song so loudly that people stopped on the sidewalk and gaped at the car . I ca n't remember the name of the song now , but Lou Capone came to our house that evening and told my father he wanted to be my manager . Lou had no experience in show business , and neither did I. But both of us had plenty of nerve , and within a week I was hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was seventeen years old and skinny , and I had a nose , which I have since had repaired . which made me look like the Indian on the buffalo nickel . We drove into Manhattan and , in the middle of the Brooklyn Bridge , Lou said : " We got ta shorten that name Farinola . Too long to fit the headlines . " We kicked names around  --  Vic Noel , Vic Nola , Vic Farin and some others . " I got it , " I said . " We 'll use my mother 's maiden name  --  Damonc . Vic Damone . Sounds good . O.K. ? " " O.K. , " he said . Isang Prisoner of Love on the Godfrey show and got a first-place tie with a comedian named Sid Raymond . Milton Berle heard me , and with his help I was booked into LaMartiniquc in New York . I stayed there eleven weeks and I was on my way . My contract with Lou Capone stated that he was to manage me for seven years , and keep 25 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my income , and I was also to pay 6 per cent interest on any money he loaned me . The contract also specified that my father who was making about ninety dollars a week , would be liable for any debts I could n't pay . Some deal . I 've never been much of a businessman , like a lot of other performers I know , and after three or four years I did n't seem to have a dime in the bank . I was trying to figure out this red-ink situation one day when a smooth-looking man came to my dressing room . " Damonc , " he said , " I 'm your new manager . " " What are you saying ? " I said angrily . " I 've already got a manager . " He gave me one of those George Raft looks . " Listen , " he said . " I 'm your new manager . I bought half your contract from Lou Capone , and I 'm running things now . " I 've been told that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are times when you have to let go . I did n't like being pushed around like something in a stockyard . " Why do n't you guys ask me first ? " I snapped . " If you 're going to cut me up like a piece of beef I want to know about it . " My association with Lou Capone came to a violent end right there . 1 bought back my contract for 545,000 ? it took two years to do that  --  got another manager and never dealt with Capone again . If this is ingratitude  --  as they say  --  then I suppose I am ungrateful . By this time I owed the Federal Government SI 12,000 in back taxes . I was paralyzed with worry , and word got around that I was desperate for cash , as indeed I was . At the height of this trouble  --  I was living in Hollywood by that time  --  I was visited by a man I had known long before in Brooklyn . I knew he was in the rackets , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . He offered to pay up my delinquent taxes and give me additional money provided I would sign a contract giving him 25 per cent of my gross earnings for the next ten years . I turned him down with thanks , and I never saw him again . I have since paid up my tax bill , and I hope the gentleman from the underworld will not be around again . All this  --  going back to that unfortunate column item I mentioned earlier  --  is probably what was meant by " mob trouble . " Somewhere along the line , in my fierce clawing to reach the top , I must have lost my sense of values . Success came too early , too fast , and there was too much . I went from coffee money to $5000 a week before I was twenty , and 1 did n't handle it very well . In Hollywood not long ago , Nick Sevano , who was my manager for a while after Lou Capone , was talking to a mutual acquaintance and he said : " Damone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added that I was selfish , always late for appointments , rude to the press and ungrateful to those who knew me when . This criticism hurt , because even as he was saying these things Nick was fingering a gold money clip I gave him , and he was wearing a gold St. Christopher medal on which I had engraved : " To my Buddy , Nick . " I 've been sitting here trying to analyze his remarks , and wondering whether he was justified . Perhaps he was . It 's easy to develop blind spots when the Broadway lights dazzle your eyes , when money comes in so fast you can hardly spend it , and when the " yes " men are giving you the sweet talk . I never really learned how to give . I do n't mean money or gifts , because I 've poured out thousands when or where I thought it would give someone pleasure . What 1 mean is , I never learned to give of myself . For example , I used to drag six or eight people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cat alone . I needed people to keep telling me I was a great guy . I always picked the check , but there was one thing wrong . t made them cat what I was eating . They never saw a menu . I just ordered for them . So one night one guest shoved back his plate with obvious irritation and said : " Vic , did it ever occur to you that I do n't like lasagne and would rather have steak ? " He got up without another word and walked out . Of course it had n't occurred to me , and I suddenly realized I had been doing this out of sheer selfishness . In effect I was telling them to like what I liked , or else . I have n't ordered for anyone since . This was one small incident , and may not seem important . But there were many others , which I carefully hid away in a mental closet . Looking over these dusty skeletons in the daylight now , they look harmless and I wonder why I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two so-called exposes about me. and I was afraid to show my face in public . One of those stories was true , but I felt at the time that the writer was the real culprit , not I. I could have killed him . I was blue for weeks after Bosley Crowther , of The New York Times , reviewing Kismet , my first big picture , wrote : " Mr. Damone , as the youliscaliph , would make a tine cigar-store Indian . " My contemporaries thought this was very funny and kept telling me : " Vic , I saw your last picture , and I think it 's going to be your last . " It was too . I could n't roll with these punches , and I did n't have the emotional balance to laugh at myself and say : You know something ? ! had the big chance and I muffed it . I 'll do better next time  --  if there is a next time . These fumbles , and there were many , gave me an agonizing fear of failure . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would die suddenly . Life was too good . too exciting , too luxurious , and I could n't believe it would last . There were many times when these fears brought wild panic , and I must have been an aggravatI man to have around . I wrestled a pillow at night , and I jumped like a pogo stick during the day . I took pills to sleep , and pills to stay awake . Someone told me the stars were at fault , t and so I took up astrology . There were I months when I would n't start the day without consulting a horoscope , and I 'm I sure my agents and managers thought I was losing my mind when I would say : " I 'm not going to keep that recording date today . Jupiter is in the wrong spot . " These fixations became so acute eventually that they threatened to wreck my career . I did n't like any of the songs that were offered to me for recording , and I began to doubt my own voice . One evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thirtieth street to record a t song with Percy Faith and his orchestra . I had the strange feeling that Percy did n't like me because he kept turning his back on me while he was conducting . When they cued me for the first take , 1 noticed the engineers were using an overhead microphone . It was out of sight over my head , and it gave me a naked , lost feeling . - " Look , " 1 said , " 1 ca n't sing into that damn thing up there . I want a mike standing right in front of me . " Mitch Miller , who was supervising the session in the control booth , came out , thoughtfully fingering his beard . He smiled mysteriously , spoke to a crew man and said : " O.K. Give him what he wants . " We recorded four or five takes , and the playbacks sounded so third-rate to inc that I wanted to die . Mitch finally got an acceptable tape , and I fled into the night  --  or so they told me later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew . 1 have a shadowy recollection of running uptown on Third Asenue without a hat or coat , finding a tau and rushing to the Copacabana , where I was appearing . Milt Ebbins says he found me locked in my dressing room , sobbing and begging him not to have the recording released . " Wait until tomorrow , " he said gently , " and then you 'll lose this record . It 's going to be big . " And he was right . The song was On Ithe Street Where You Live , and the gold record , signifying a sale of more than 1,000,000 records , is now on the wall of my den . But when I next saw Mitch Miller , who had already helped me win four other gold records , I stuck my foot in it . " I 'm proud about the record , Mitch , " I said , " but you 've got to admit I was right about the standup mike . " " Did n't anyone tell you about that , Vic ? " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He looked at Inc searchingly , and he must have figured I could take it . " That mike , " he said . " was phony . It was dead . " I never questioned his technical judgment again , but this little lesson in psychology was not the final answer . I was still unsure of myself . I tried to understand myself and these conflicting emotions and , because there seemed no altcrnativc , I reluctantly agreed to undergo psychoanalysis . Many of the pig names in Hollywood were visiting " head shrinkcrs " as they are called . Indeed , it was almost a fad , like miniature golf or foreign sports cars . I was scheduled for thrice-weekly sessions with a very distinguished analyst . and I was pretty shaky when I went to his office for my first couch talk . " Damone. " he said almost immediately , " tell me about your love life . " " Lose life ? " I said . " What 's that got to do with making bad records or losing friends or being afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to fight everybody , why I 'm sore at the whole world , why I want to quit show business . " " All these things have the same basic cause , " he said , " and love has a lot to do with it . " I suspect the doctor was on the right track , but I was not ready for him . I was looking fur an easy , ready-made cure for everything , and his approach seemed frivolous . I canceled the remainingappointments and never went back . It has often been said that you do n't need a ( Continued on Page 93 ) ( Continued from Pao 9 ! ) psychoanalyst if you know the nature of your problems . I think I understand many of my conflicts , but I 'm not convinced that I know how to handle them . George Woods , of the William Morris Agency , who has watched over me for years and is almost like a member of the family , recently said : " Vic shifts the blame to others when he makes a mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has a big heart , but he just does n't think when he acts . Ile has n't grown up yet . " George does not know , until he reads this , that these words were repeated to me . But I am sure he is right and I could add this to it : " Vic also did n't know when to keep his mouth shut . " I have reread the scolding memorandum from my former press agents , particularly the line that says : " He complains about the Army in interviews . " I have also been told that I should not talk about my mother-in-law . I used to think that gags about the Army or your mot her-in-law were a standard part of American humor . Every comedian I know has a repertoire of mother-in-law jokes , and the magazines arc full of cartoons on the subject . There was an Army general once . I think , who said : " Show me a G.I. who does n't gripe , and I 'll show you a bad soldier . " Bill Mauldin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame , and others have earned fortunes ribbing the Army . But my press agents said that for singers or other so-called celebrities these G.I. gripes can be the public-relations kiss of death . I hope this is n't true , because I have popped off now and then . like millions of other men . I may have been young and stupid in my gummed-up love affair with the United States Army . but there was never any real rancor in my heart . I was in the soup right from the beginning . I was inducted on May 10 , 1951 , at 44 Whitehall Street in New York . There were news photographers on hand , and there were some unfortunate cracks about an entertainer giving up 55000 a week to work in the Army for seventy dollars a month . I was twenty-two years old , and I certainly was n't making any real sacrifice . I wanted to be a good American , and a good soldier , but I made one mistake after another . During basic training at Fort Dix , in New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive convertible , I officially asked to be sent to Korea . " You want to risk that pretty face and that remodeled nose , and give up that fancy car ? " one officer said . " Now just a minute , sir ? " I interrupted . " You want to be a hero , eh ? " he went on . " Everybody wants to be a hero . Good publicity . Right ? " Well , I had asked for it and I got it , like a left hook to the chin . Maybe he was a rock ' n ' roll man , which I 'm not . I do n't know . In anycase , I never got near Korea . They shipped me to Germany , and I was put to work in a shop stocked with USO costumes in Nuremberg . Naturally 1 griped . Other singers in uniform were entertaining the troops all over the world and I felt I could contribute a little something extra to Uncle Sam in addition to my time and my doubtful usefulness as a costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must have read the reviews on my pictures , and they forgot I was there . Also , they probably had me Pegged as a sorehead , and at the time they were n't far wrong . got into an argument with a superior officer because I bought a foreign car against his orders , and I stubbornly repeated my request to be allowed to sing for the men , I also asked permission to make some recordings on my own leave time , but they turned me down on that too . I guess I was hit by a had case of self-pity , and I told myself that no sound-so of a major or colonel could do this to me . I got a weekend pass , went to Munich and secretly recorded half a dozen songs . The music was pre-recorded in New York and airmailed to Munich by the Mercury Records people , and I dubbed in my voice over it . The Army never did find out how these records were made , and I hope I 'm not inviting a court-martial by confessing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh , for the punishment I got was far worse than anything they could impose . Those smuggled records turned out to be the worst I ever made , and as far as I know they 're still unsold and gathering dust on the music-store shelves around the country . Aside from all this , the Army unwittingly changed the whole course of my life , and for that I am forever grateful . On one of my leaves in Munich , when I was terribly blue and lonely , I heard that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had a unit in town making a picture . I wandered in there , hoping to find a familiar face , and there I met an enchanting but unknown Italian actress named Anna Maria Pierangeli . We went oat together whenever we could steal an hour or two and I courted Anna until the Army transferred me from Germany to Texas . When 1 was discharged about a year later , I was as good as dead in show business . Bookers were saying : Vic Damone ? ; rho needs him ? The public is quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mentioned by:disk jocks or seen up in lights . The few friends I had before I went overseas soon discovered that I was washed up , and this deadly news spread like a plague . Head waiters in my favorite restaurants stuck me off in dark corners , and song pluggers , who once loved me like a brother , passed me on the street without a nod . 1 was blinded and hurt by this total eclipse and for a long time , there being no other convenient scapegoat . I blamed the Army . One man heard me beefing about this recently and said : " Vic , one of these times you 're going to gripe in front of a guy whose son or brother was killed in Korea , and he 's going to bust you wide open . " He made me feel small and ashamed , and I promised I would never mention the subject again . It took me two long years , virtually starting from scratch , to beat that professional blackout and start earning enough money so I could ask Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timothy 's Church in Hollywood on November 24 , 1954 , and we took a small rented house on a hill overlooking Sunset Boulevard . Anna was twenty-two , and I was twenty-six , but I sometimes think neither of us was prepared for the problems we had to face . I do n't know how the average American couple would define a normal married life , but when you 're in show business it 's almost impossible to fit yourself into any of the established formulas . You learn right away that you ca n't have even a friendly argument in public without having Hedda or Louella turn it into a domestic quarrel or a full-blown pfffhtt . You go to a restaurant for a quiet dinner , and you spend half your time signing autographs  --  which I love to do , of course  --  or trying to answer amazingly intimate questions by fans or reporters . Your house is a fishbowl , and tourist buses stop right at the curb while the guide points at your bedroom window and makes his spiel . The columnists know you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obstetrician , and your press agent is busy telling the newspapers that for breakfast you have three eggs boiled in champagne , or that you wear knee-length socks so they wo n't fall down around your ankles when you 're on stage . I remember the splash of distorted publicity before my Army service , for instance , when I had the hump taken out of my nose by a plastic surgeon . While I was rehearsing my TV show in New York recently there was some new gossip about my nose . In its wake Ernie Kovacs burst into my dressing room looking like a man who 's just been sentenced to Siberia . " Got to talk to you , Vic . " he said . " Real urgent . " " Your sponsor drop you or some-thing ? " " Oh , no , no , " he said . " It 's nothing that simple . Listen , Vic , I do n't want to embarrass you  --  but ? Well , I think you 've got the most beautiful teeth I ever saw . Uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who made ' cm ? Gim me the name of your dentist . " " Nobody made them . Ernie , " I said . " They 're mine . " " But I read in the papers ? " " That was my nose . Ernie . Not teeth . " His face fell like an egg souffl ? , and he backed out as though I had hit him with a bad Trendcx . Well , Anna and I could handle these minor mixups , but behind the scenes there were other crises which were not so easily solved . I have been criticized by my business manager , George Mercader  --  and this is a case in point  --  because when I am away from Hollywood I phone Anna nine or ten times a day , and exchange sentimental little telegrams with her . George is a dedicated penny watcher for me , so I did n't pay much attention to the complaints until some of my other associates said : " Really , Vic , what 's with all these sappy phone calls . What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's none of your darts business . But I had never looked at it through other eyes , and suddenly I began to see . I was Vic Damone , a nobody from Brooklyn , married to Pier Angeli , the Roman beauty who had been carefully and almost savagely trained for the stage from the day she was five years old . I had the naive idea that I had won a wife , not a creation . But her widowed mother , Mrs. Ennca Pierangeli. had not raised her daughter to be a man 's woman , or a mother or companion , or anything else but an actress . So this lonely girl was not Mrs. Vic Damone , but Miss Pier Angell , Metro-Goldwyn-Nlayer 's million-dollar star . I would go into a theater and sec her being kissed by handsome leading men . I would hear her whisper to them : " I love you . " just the way she whispered it to me . And , to paraphrase the old joke , I heard myself saying : Hey , that 's no actress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't stand it , and I had to stop seeing her pictures .
