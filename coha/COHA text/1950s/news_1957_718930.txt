txt " While sitting down thanking of you , I thought I would write you a few lines to let you hear from me , " said this letter from a Chicago lady to Gov . Stratton . " I wrote you over six weeks ago , if the governor of Chicago ca n't give me help when I need it ? who else ? I still need an electric appliance , curtains , furs , blankets , clothing , shoes , bags , gloves , hats , furniture , a n d some umbrellas . " Now it is- the duty of the governor 's secretary , Miss Marion P. Keevers , to handle this perplexing mail , and if she did not come from Coal City , and from sturdy stock , like Matt Keevers , it is doubtful she could cope with it . Then , naturally , a gentleman from Rome , N. M. , wrote in on a real pretty red Christmas card , with some music on It , and the following message : " How are the grasshoppers in Albany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piano , and want to be a detective . So please send me a pass on the Southern Pacific . " This , of course , is a matter for Secretary of State Carpentier , who , while he does not speak five languages , has ridden on a train . rr HERE was a plaintive note I ? from out Aurora way , which said : " Is n't there any way to come home to the wife , as I have not seen her for 23 years ? I have been practicing to dance for 23 years , and not a cent made . " Now Miss Keevers would be hard pressed to fish out an answer to this gnarled ask . But why not send it to Paul Prehn , assistant state superintendent of education , and a real good wrestler ? Mr. Prehn might not be able to fetch this troubled terpsichorean home to his spouse . But he is an accomplished dancer , and might go and dance with this fellow a little . Probably cheer him a great deal . " I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago , " and I feel it is my civic duty as a citizen to inform you just what is going on here . First of all , what respect does Mr. ? ? have for his governor , when he lies to the governor ? Did it ever occur to you to check if a marriage license was ever issued to him . Then , in my block , they are renting basement rooms without any ventilation in the bathroom ? With all due respects , this block is a mess . " There is not too much that can be done with a thing like this . - ? - ? rr HEN a Chicagoan took pen I in hand to eke out a mild complaint that some Lithuanians keeP  --  talking quite . loudly in his neighborhood , and this keeps him from getting in his best thinking . Now Miss Keevers has another matter which has furrowed her brow a couple of tucks . A fellow , wrote in to say he 'd thrown a bottle out of his car window , saw a sign saying " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks . " We 'd like to find him , " said Miss Keevers . disconsolately ; " because the Illinois fine is $50 . He saw that sign in Indiana . "
