txt ? After struggling twelve days against the fury of Atlantic winds and waves , Henrik Kurt Carlsen , captain of the American freighter Flying Enterprise , finally left the ship today shortly before she sank in the English Channel . Captain Carlsen , who had remained aboard in an effort to save his stricken ship from the sea , got away safely with Kenneth Dancy , mate of the British salvage tug , Turmoil , who joined him in his gallant battle last Saturday . Tonight they reached Falmouth on the Turmoil which had once taken the Flying Enterprise under tow but lost her when the angry sea lashed out again and broke the towing line . At 4:10 P. M. , forty minutes after Captain Carlsen and Mr. Dancy had leaped into the sea from the ship 's funnel and had been picked up by the Turmoil , the 6,711-ton Flying Enterprise plunged to Ithe lower depths in a final blaze of fire and sound . Flares that had rolled off the ship 's deck became ignited and the vessels standing guard over the shattered hulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miles Away After twelve days of drift and tow and drift again , the American freighter went down less than fifty miles southeast of safety in this port . All last night and this morning Merciless winds , which are normal off England 's south coast at this season , drove twenty-foot swells against the sloping deck of the Enterprise , the portside rail of which was right under the water . Water was entering the cracked hull so that the ship rode lower and lower . The list increased to an estimated 80 degrees before noon . Messages exchanged among the Enterprise , the Turmoil and the United States destroyer Willard Keith reporting every change in the worsening situation were overheard by shortwave listeners along the coast . Captain Carlsen had to abandon his powerful set in the radio room and rely on a weaker set M the cabin higher on the superstructure . At 10 ; 50 A. M. the Willard Keith relayed Captain Carlsen 's message that there was no cause for abandoning ship yet . Comdr . Leslie J. O'Brien of the Willard Keith informed him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the ship . Captain Carlsen replied he was glad to know it was standing by but did not desire it yet . Hoped for Break in Weather Captain Carlsen , whose judgmeat had proved itself equal to his courage all along , obviously was coming to the conclusion that only a break in the weather could save his increasingly waterlogged vessel . Shortly before noon the Willard Keith estimated the Enterprise 's deepest roll as close to 85 degrees . Ninety would be flat over on her side . Captain Carlsen was still hopeful of getting back to the radio room if the wind and waves subsided a little . At noon he and Mr. Dancy were keeping warm as best they could , wrapped in blankets in the cabin . They had attached a rope to the cabin door to prepare an emergency getaway over the ship 's starboard or uphill side . Then there was nothing to do but wait and hope . Shortly after 2 P. M. a pair of landbased R. A. F. helicopters started out seaward with a rig intended to lift the men from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willard Keith . Regretfully , the R. A. F. informed the Willard Keith the gale was too much for the helicopters and that the aircraft had to return . - At this stage another three-cornered wireless conference was called . The captains of the Willard 1Keith and Turmoil impressed on Captain Carlson their view that the situation , was critical . This time he agreed . A plan was arranged for Captain Carlsen and Mr. Dancy to walk out along the broad starboard surface of the Enterprise 's smokestack  --  now almost horizontal  --  to get a good start into the sea away from the ship 's debris . The powerful Land 's End radio issued a " full distress action " warning to other radio transmitters to leave all channels in the vicinity clear for tile Enterprise and the accompanying vessels , including a motor lifeboat from Lizard Point . Men Take Up Positions It was after ' 3 P. M. when the two officers , wearing lifebelts , took up their position out toward the end of the smokestack . The Turmoil blinked signals with her lights . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowels of the ship through the funnel . Picking their moment , the two men leaped into a receding wave ? Captain Carlsen a split second after Mr. Dancy in accordance with the tradition that a captain should be the last to leave . The wave carried them clear of the confusion of the ship 's rigging and , floating debris . They struck out Mrand the Turmoil but did not make much progress . Under Captain Dan Parker 's orders the tic , jockeyed around until she had the two men off her starboard bow . A rope ladder was lowered and lifelines were tossed . Captain Carlsen motioned Mr. Dancy to climb up first . The salvage officer , ten years younger than the thirty-seven-year-old skipper , came aboard by his own efforts . Captain Carlsen , after his fortnight 's ordeal , had to be lifted by the lifeline to which he clung . He actually came over the side before Mr. Dancy . They were in the water less than five minutes . The crew of the Turmoil said both men had enough strength to walk the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . But Captain Carlsen did turn to the crew ? mindful perhaps that their hopes of extra bonuses were disappearing with the mortally wounded Flying Enterprise ? and said : " You 've done a good job , boys . " Then to Mr. Dancy , he said : " I wish I had ten mates like you . " Captain ( arsen and Mr. Dancy , who was barefooted , were led below immediately to change into dry clothing and  --  the Turmoil 's steward said  --  to have a cup of tea . By prearrangement , the Turmoil immediately headed toward Falmouth while the Willard Keith remained on guard over the hulk of the Enterprise , now filling fast . Waves stove in the hatches and ' water was pouring in the smokestack as well . Shortly after 4 P. M. ? scarcely forty minutes after the two men had left her  --  she settled by the stern . Her bows shot fifteen feet into the air and then she slid smoothly to her grave . The surrounding vessels saluted with long blasts on their whistles . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five miles away ' at that time and he was probably spared the sight of his ship going down . The crew of the Turmoil said that during the four-hour run to Falmouth both men got some sleep then some hot food and were last reported as guests of Capt . Dan Parker in his cabin . Captain Carlsen was reported to have taken the opportunity to shave off the two weeks ' beard which he had earlier predicted would take four razors to remove . The Willard Keith dropped anchor in Falmouth harbor tonight . Rough weather denied shore leave to the crew members , who were catching up on their sleep . Falmouth 's Reception Today Although the Turmoil 's crew members were told they could debark as soon as customs formalities in the outer harbor were completed , Captain Carlsen and Mr. , Dancy Were expected to sleep on board and face their reception tomorrow morning . The only visitor permitted aboard the Turmoil this evening was Mr. Dancy 's schoolboy brother , Tony . The crew was disappointed but not - surprised that the cable snapped early yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Channel . One man said : " I did n't think it would hold as long as it did . " There was no let-up in the Channel storm that sealed the fate of the Enterprise . Even the sheltered inner port of Falmouth was covered with whitecaps . Farther out , where the Turmoil awaited customs clearance , a dozen small craft were bobbing about In the darkness illuminated by photo flash bulbs . The crew members of the Turmoil were affable but stood by to repel would-he boarders , under the ' captain 's orders . There was good cheer in the . harbor taverns as sailors and reIporters toasted the international teamwork that had brought the two brave men to skfety even if the ship and cargo were lost . If the . Turmoil had not been there the destroyer Willard Keith I would have done the necessary . , And if no larger vessel had been available the job would have been done by the men who usually do it  --  the ** crews who cover all the coast of England . The Lizard Point lifeboat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been relieved this evening by the Falmouth lifeboat which put out in the midst of the storm early this afternoon . She was only a thirty-foot craft , about the same dimensions as the the old open boats . However , she was motor driven , with twin masts for , radio antenna and a covered deck so that the waves could break right over . Seven men in yellow oilskins , with9 hearty , seagoing faces took her out to ? an ancient West Country . send-off , " Godspeed to . ' ee . " They were well out in the Channel before they learned that C  --  ptain Carlsen and Mr. Dancy had been saved . ? An official welcome to Captain Carlsen and his rescuers will be extended tomorrow morning . A launch from the Willard Keith has been detailed to bring tilem to the Prince of Wales pier in the-heart of town . The .
