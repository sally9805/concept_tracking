The Springfield Rifle was sighted in to minute-of-angle accuracy for this very special hunt . It crashed its bullets to the bull's-eye with power and precision . At the end of 10 rounds the eye , Hogan ( Kid ) Bassey 's , was all but shot away . The Rifle , Featherweight Champion Davey Moore , who hails from Springfield , Ohio , had won another medal for expert marksmanship . Thereby he saved his title . // Moore , who had won the title from Bassey at this same Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles last March , and in much the same way , looked better defending his championship than in winning it . He was far ahead on points when Bassey , right eye closing to a slit , blood spurting from a minor cut near the left eye , body sore from relentless pummeling , slumped onto his stool after the bell ending the 10th round . There Bassey told his handlers , " No more . " In much the same plight on the night he lost the championship , Bassey also quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Some of the crowd booed as the little Nigerian street brawler stayed on his stool when the bell rang for the 11th round  --  thus , by California rules , making it an llth-round knockout . The boos were unfair , the result of a cultural misunderstanding which is very like that which prevails between Richard Nixon and Nikita Khrushchev . Only rarely does an American fighter quit on his stool . Carmen Basilio fought gallantly against Sugar Ray Robinson with one eye closed . Archie Moore , pounded into exhaustion by Rocky Marciano , insisted to the referee that he wanted to be knocked out . But European-trained fighters commonly quit when they see no chance to win , and it is not held to be a disgrace to do so . // Theoretically , if Bassey had continued he might have won . He was three or four rounds behind on most cards , and there were five rounds to go . But he had no chance at all . A rapidly weakening Bassey clearly lacked the steam to land even a lucky punch of any consequence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common defect of European-trained fighters , again a cultural difference . European referees strictly enforce the rules against low blows , accidental or not . The fear of losing points , or even a decision , because of an accidental foul forces most European fighters to concentrate on head-punching . By the same token , they do not expect to be hit much about the body , and so they have neglected to build up adequate defense below the chin . // Bassey was very easily hit to the body and Moore took sound advantage of the situation . Repeatedly , the champion 's spirit-sapping hooks to the rib cage and belly brought down Bassey 's guard . Toward the end Moore was able to fire at the closing right eye almost at will . // It took Moore less time to win the fight than to make the weight . The morning weigh-in dragged on for an hour and 34 minutes while the lean little champion hopped on and off the scales seven times . Between trips to the scales he retired to the dressing room to sweat off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spat a few times and exhaled furiously on the scales , he brought the pointer to a teetery balance at 126 . Bassey came in at 125. // The distinctive training methods of Ingemar Johansson , who scandalized boxing 's traditionalist puritans by dancing in nightclubs and relaxing in the Grossinger sun , have a modest counterpart in Davey Moore 's peculiar approach to physical fitness . Davey spent the first three of his nine weeks ' training mostly in bed , sleeping as many as 18 hours a day . He did no sparring or roadwork at the time , limbering up with a little soft-ball and horseshoe pitching . But mostly he just slept . At the end of the three weeks he began a gradual shift to more ordinary methods . // There was talk afterward that Moore might take on Joe Brown for the lightweight title , but it seemed more likely that his next opponent will be Paul Jorgensen , ranked No. 3 by the National Boxing Association . Whoever the opponent is , he had better practice ducking bullets .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
