txt The House Appropriations Committee recommended a $350,000,000 increase in the military budget today on the advice of Louis Johnson , Secretary of Defense . In a series of rapid developments , the ground was laid for early House approval of the additional outlays in line with the counsel of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower , Allied Supreme Commander in the second World War and now president of Columbia University . Of the extra money , $300,000,000 would be used for aircraft procurement and $50,000,000 for anti-submarine vessels . Of the $300,000,000 figure , the Air Force would get $200,000,000 to assure maintenance of a fully modern establishment of forty-eight groups and $100,000 , - 000 would go to the naval air arm . The additions would raise President Truman 's miltary budget for the 1951 fiscal year , which begins July 1 , to $14,464,460,000 in total cash appropriations and contract authority , not allowing for a reduction of $203,000,000 written into the pending omnibus appropriations bill last month by the House Appropriations Committee . Restoring Earlier Cut Waits The committee did not act today on Secretary Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly entailed proposed savings in administration and equipment purchases , but it unanimously approved his other recommendations . He presented them successively to closed sessions of House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees that handle defense appropriations . The full House committee formally accepted them within fifteen minutes after similar action by its subcommittee . In a statement prepared for the Senate group and made public later , Mr. Johnson said the additional outlays had been approved by President Truman . They were based on a recently completed reappraisal of the defense budget by the Joint Chiefs of Staff , which Secretary Johnson ordered after General Eisenhower testified that several hundred millions of dollars probably should be added to assure a proper balance between the requirements of security and economy . Bipartisan Support Given Representative Carl Vinson , Democrat of Georgia , chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , immediately announced his endorsement . He said he would drop plans to obtain House approval of $583,289,221 in additional funds for the Air Force and naval aviation . Representative Joseph W. Martin Jr . of Massachusetts , the House minority leader , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lagging " economy drive " for reductions in the omnibus appropriations bill . " While we are for economy , " he told reporters , " we have always made an exception for national defense , because you have got to keep the defenses strong , and you have to rely on the Joint Chiefs of Staff knowing what is needed . " Amendments to provide the extra funds will be offered by Representative George H. Mahon , Democrat of Texas , to the omnibus appropriations bill now under consideration on the House floor . Mr. Mahon is chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee in charge of defense requirements . The House is expected to reach the pertinent part of the supply measure within several weeks . Secretary Johnson , in his prepared statement , reported that the Defense Department had been engaged in a re-evaluation of the country 's military requirements since last Sept. 23 , when President Truman announced that there had been an atomic explosion in the Soviet Union . Among the consequences , he said , were the President 's decision to proceed with construction of the hydrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the supplementary military aid program . " We have also appraised recent events which make it entirely possible that appropriations in excess of those which have been requested for the current year will be re- , quired in succeeding years , " the Secretary continued , " not only for our own military forces but also for the military aid program . " The events to which I allude include the Soviet atomic explosion , the fall of China , the serious situations in Southeast Asia , the break in diplomatic relations with Bulgaria and deteriorating relations with other satellite countries , the Soviet assumption of control over the armed forces of Poland , Soviet ' naval expansion , the increased Soviet pressures in Germany , the recent attack on naval aircraft in the Baltic and the recent Soviet 1 demands relative to Trieste . " Eisenhower 's Views Cited Devoting his statement largely to comments on General Eisenhower 's March 29 suggestions for improving defenses , Secretary Johnson said that his decision to ask for more funds was based " in the main on the continuing reevaluations referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joint Chiefs of Staff . General Eisenhower had mentioned garrisons for Alaskan air bases , modernization of aircraft and army equipment , reinforcement of anti-submarine facilities , intelligence and industrial mobilization as areas for high-priority attenton . Mr. Johnson 's recommendation of $200,000,000 more for Air Force procurement was $50,000,000 above General Eisenhower 's suggested figure . The latter did not specify sums for the other items . The President 's original budget allowed $2,000,000,000 for aircraft procurement ? $1.350,000,000 of it for the Air Force and $650,000,000 for the Navy . In addition , Mr. Johnson discic:sed , arrangements have been completed whereby marine aviation during the 1951 fiscal year will include sixteen air combat squadrons instead of the twelve squadrons contemplated when the budget was submitted in January . This will be financed by economies elsewhere in the budget , he said . He reported that the department was also adding to the Army procurement program , out of savings made elsewhere , $24,000,000 " to help speed up the research and development for certain weapons , particularly anti-tank weapons . " Plans for Alaskan Defense AR for Alaskan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorization , on which Congress is soon expected to complete action , the Defense Department would have available a total of $230,000,600 for military public works and housing in the strategic territory . " This , " he commented , " will enable us to launch as large a housing program as the highly seasonal construction picture in Alaska will permit , and is based upon our plans for providing adequate housing for military forces of the size which the Joint Chiefs of Staff intend to maintain in Alaska . " Secretary Johnson declined to discuss military intelligence publicly . On the subject of industrial mobillzn , he said his department 's P71:ns were " already well advanced " and were " adequately provided for by the funds included in the President 's budget . " He stressed that industrial mobilization , in its broader aspect , was the responsibility of the National Security Resources Board , of which W. Stuart Symington , former Secretary of the Air Force , became chairman today . Mr. Johnson said he was sure that Mr. Symington would " leave no stone unturned in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Says Economy Program Stands Secretary Johnson emphasized that his new requests for aircraft and anti-submarine outlays did not mean abandonment of the department 's economy program . He said it would be " carried on with undiminished vigor because we must continue to eliminate overhead in applying our resources to building up combatant forces . " Today 's developments promised on the other hand to have cpnsiderable adverse effect on the already bogged - down " economy drive " in the House , where Republicans had avowed their intention to reduce the pending appropriations bill by at least $1,000,000,000 . The goal was obviously made impossible of achievement , according to members of Congress in close touch with the question . Today 's only test was on an amendment by Representative John Taber , Republican of New York , to cut $1,238,000 from the Federal Security Agency 's allotment . The proposal was rejected by a voice vote . In previous votes , the House had more than wiped out $8,700,000 of reductions by adding $76,000,000 in other chapters of the bill .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
