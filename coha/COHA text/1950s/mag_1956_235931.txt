Certain that he heard the call of " the people , " Texas ' conservative Democratic Senator Price Daniel decided last spring to interrupt his term in Washington to run for governor , lifted himself by the coat collar , threw himself into the saddle and went thataway . Supporting him were a solid array of 1952 " Eisencrats , " a phalanx of the oil-rich , and the more stable elements of the newly eclipsed machine of Governor Allan Shivers ( TIME , May 14 ) . Opposing him : a passel of hombres whose political tendencies are as diverse as the many species of badlands cactus , e.g. , Liberal Democrat Ralph Yarborough , cornhusking , rabble-rousing W. ( for Wilbert ) Lee ( " Pappy " ) O'Daniel , ultraconservative , ultra-segregationalist J. Ev-etts Haley . <P> From the Rio Grande to the Red River , the candidates roamed , some shooting their arguments from the hip , others employing the chuckwagon gambit-from offers of pie-in-the-sky to accusations of fingers-in-pots . Ex-Governor , ex-Senator O'Daniel , who climbed from the valley of a dingdong radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediocrity , gave the crowds a Texas-sized helping of every thing : a twanging hillbilly quintet , prom ises of a 25% state-funded rebate on fed eral income taxes , veterans ' bonuses , old-age pensions , and a vicious harangue about " those nine cowards " in the Su preme Court who " tell us we got to eat with Negroes , play together , sit to gether , sleep together , and do everything together . Pretty soon , there 'll be little parties . . . nature will take its course , they intermarry , and the mongrel race takes over . " Yarborough rode even harder , plying the city folks with warnings about the Shivers regime 's land corruption , greasing the rural populace with his own cowboy band ( three guitars ) , offers of higher pen sions ( " We 'll just let those rich Repub licans pay for it " ) . Though he hedged considerably on the segregation issue , Yar borough could at least proclaim his strict party loyalty . <P> Meanwhile , back on the range , Price Daniel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no bones about his 1952 support of Eisenhower , spoke quietly and sincerely , radiated a comfortable aura of respectability and conservatism . Coolly in favor of segregation ( " separate but equal " ) , he allowed that he would back the Democratic presidential nominee this year " unless that nominee makes it impossible " for him to do so , offered to give the people " simple honesty and moral integrity in government . " <P> When roundup time came in Texas last week , it was plain that Price Daniel had ridden well . He corralled 553,000 votes ; Yarborough limped in with 409,000 , Pappy O'Daniel bit the dust with 310,000 . Next scene : a Daniel-Yarborough runoff on Aug. 25 . The boys in the bunkhouse were predicting an even wider margin of victory for Daniel .
