txt Texas cotton growers were told the nation 's 1951 production goal of 16 million bales " looks as though " it will be reached . This cautious prediction was made by Ralph S. Trigg. administrator of the Production and Marketing Administration and president of the Commodity Credit Corp .. at the annual meeting of the Texas Cotton Association in Dallas . The new goal la up 60% from last year 's 10 million-bale crop , and calls for the planting of 28,500.000 acres of upland cotton , 10 million more than were planted in 1950 . Texas ' shares of the total crop is 11.600.000 bales . or about 72% . In addition to upland cotton production . the Agriculture Department is aiming at the growth of 75,000 bales of extra-long staple American-Egyptian cotton on 135,000 acres . Texas growers have been asked to plant about 44.000 acres of this type . which will be supported by the C.C.C . at prices averaging 31.04 a pound . " We see no need for alarm about the overall situation , " Mr. Trigg said . " There will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Labor Supply a Problem He singled out labor supply as the " number one problem . " and said the department was " doing everything " it could to overcome this . The condition is expected to be eased by the classification of farm labor as " essential " to the defense effort , thereby exempting it from armed forces service , and by importation of foreign labor . " Agriculture production today . " Mr. Trigg asserted , " is very definitely defense production . " The P.M.A. official noted a lesser hurdle to the production goal included adequate fertilizer , pest control materials and farm machinery . He said " tight spots " are bound to appear in fertilizer supply and that some substitution would probably have to be made in the use of pesticides . He added farm machinery production may drop off this year , but claimed a great bulk of the equipment needed for the new crop is already on the farms . Mr. Trigg touched lightly on the price ceiling squabble . He put the responsibility for price control on the Office of Price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply , or continue , any controls which are not essential in meeting over-all objectives , " he said . The Texas group was told domestic consumption from last August through January totaled 5,500.000 bales , compared with 4,500 , - 000 for the like period a year ago . On the basis of the daily rate of consumption for those first six months . Mr. Trigg said " it is expected domestic use may be around 10 , - 500,000 bales this year . " In addition to this amount . he said foreign customers would buy about six million bales of II . S. cotton during the 1950-51 season " if our supplies were adequate . " With regard to export allocations and licensing already in effect , the Government official said 1950-51 reports would be in the neighborhood of four million bales . " We believe that protection of our domestic economy must be a basic objective . " Fight Synthetic Competition Mr. Trigg also warted growers of the need for large production to ' fight growing competition from synthetics , noting the rayon industry exceeded production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year with a total production of 1.250 million pounds , equivalent to 2,250,000 bales of cotton . Mr. Trigg defended the C.C.C . program of price support and stockpiling , asserting total investment in inventory stocks or commodity loans as of March , 1950 , was " a little more than $4 billion . " He said less than 10% of this amount was in perishable goods . " A year ago at this time , " Mr. Trigg said , " the C.C.C . was holding 3.646.000 bales of cotton in inventory . In addition , it had loans outstanding on 2,638.000 bales  --  a total of more than six million bales in inventory and loans . Our cotton inventory on March 5 this year was less than 100,000 bales , and only relatively minor quantities of cotton were under loan . " He- added the last official report showed total C.C.C . investment in inventory and loan holdings for all commodities was down to about $2,750 million . Mr. Trigg said most of the cotton inventory a. year ago was of the 1948 crop . The C.C.C . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pool  --  about 9.000 bales  --  in order to speed up distribution of the pooled proceeds , which will amount to about $66 million " We expect to start mailing checks early in April to the growers who have interest in this cotton , " he annone ? - es ? ? t will take from eight to 10 weeks to complete the distribution . " , BRASS AND BRONZE MOOTS tshipmeats during February totaled 27,168 tons , against 28,416 tons in January and 18,487 tons in Februirry , 1950 , according to the Defense Council of the Ingot Brass and Bronze Tidostry.
