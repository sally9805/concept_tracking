? And then it came to him out of this burning weather of no season , how it had arranged itself , Fate 's tableau , scarcely a month ago , the three of them down by the front gate , Joe Cree , Lucius , and Pete Legrand , the irreducible number until he wandered up to borrow a middlebuster . Lucius had no hat on and under the sun the boy 's head and fair skin and gray eyes gave him the look of something husked by lye water ; and Joe with one hand on the gatepost , regarding Pete Legrand fair enough to burn . Oh , his eye was level and laid like a rule , but it was a bushwhacking eye such as no man turns upon a neighbor . He saw it all now , the clear image of hindsight . Hindsight , God 's little trick to keep us all in our places . Pete erect in his buggy but favoring his middle , flicking the whip at the horsefly buzzing about his nag 's collar , saying as how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pike , he knowing how pressed Joe was to cut over the widow 's timber before the time ran out and Joe replying , In this weather ? You might as well scrape water as dust . And Legrand looking away , saying , He 'd heard Corley Puckett , the mail carrier , meant to have the gates thrown open and that would cut down on the profits . Then Joe  --  It was common knowledge that Corley Puckett had piles and the court must know it by now , but anyway the court had better sense than to throw open the gates for an act of God . Pete flicked his whip and the fly buzzed away , but not far away , and his voice  --  My crops are worked over , the teams and hands idle . Talk thrown out like a screen of scouts to hide the real business of looking , and each time Joe Cree shifted his eyes from Pete to Lucius his sight hazed over as if it had picked up a lacquer , dry and glistening . Nobody spoke or moved after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quieted in the sand where the creek crosses the road , and the boy 's face flat and the sun husking it like lye water . . . and then Joe Cree turned , with no civil word , and walked heavily , shoulders bent slightly as before a high wind , and no wind stirred , nothing but the heat drying the already dry air , towards the house . And then Lucius must have felt the strangeness , not knowing ,  |p101for  he said , I 'll help you find the middlebuster . And he , himself , I 'll get it tomorrow . Come ride home with me . Why then ? Pete had a husked look too , but so had he always looked . Why that time to see what was there to be seen all along ? And then  --  Somebody told Joe Cree about that time , on the hunt , Julia and Pete Legrand got lost together . But who ? After so many years , who could have saved it back so long a time ? Out of what hurt or meanness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , Jack Cropleigh , who knew all things ? Why at the one time it might have been some profit to see , and so have stopped it . And why did Lucius have to be caught up at his coming to manhood ? Lucius stared fixedly upon no point ahead . There 's a grief now . Youth 's sorrow : no past , no future , the one time do n't know itself . Or joy , why not joy ? It 's all the same to a boy , caught up in one blinding whirl of immediacy , the senses short-circuiting themselves . Jack wiped his brow and pulled the hat brim lower . What would become of history if all men died at twenty ? History , the backward-stepping rocks of a dry stream bed , that tells you where you 've been , if you can backtrack yourself . The young ca n't see ; the old looking back to see forward : all bewildered , caught up by feeling or revery . Who 's to show the way ? Joe Cree , dead in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a brief mortality . Lucius will weep , sleep , afterwards wake to eat a hearty breakfast : the drought will break , the rains come , the seasons turn , and you 're left with history . History , the delayed surprise . Ahead Jack saw the break in the trees where the old Indian trace crossed the road . " I was thinking about history , " he said aloud . " Yonder lies its path , between that cedar and that scaly bark it looks to be a cow path . Well , it ai nt , although cows are about all that uses there now . It 's the old war trace , and along it your people and mine come through here , trodding the wander weed , and they stopped off at Black Foxp102cave and said  --  Here we are and it 's all ours to do with . It twists and turns but it 's sweet with shade . I 'm not suggesting it , but if you turned off on it , we would n't have to bother maybe with sunstroke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 'll bring us out in human shape . " He sighed and shifted his weight . The buggy rocked . " Do n't mind me . I 'm just talking to make sure I can still talk . I do n't know at what point the brains cook and free the tongue to babble , making sense and non-sense equal for once . " Lucius made no reply . The sun by now , late morning as it was , could nowhere be seen . The world was the core of its brilliance , the rings of light consuming the rings of heat , the form of each suffusing interchangeably the essence of each . He could no longer look up or out . He was the bird to stick his head under his wing . He pulled the hatbrim entirely over his brow . The sweat dried as it fell , crowning his forehead with the odor of himself . He never smelled so sweet , or had a sweetness do him so little good . But he had his ease at last . The jolting buggy rocked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He felt the heat even abate somewhat . His consciousness spread like a pool , and he rose and sank effortlessly , now upon the gently undulating surface , now downwards where all was a depthlessswoon . He gave himself over to the pervading rhythm of this silence . How coming down from the Peaks had tired him ! You can not outclimb it . Like the poor the dead are always with us . They go unnoticed , but all along they await us in the inner chamber . And always it is a surprise . Oh , the importunate presence .. . The horse was slowing to a walk . He felt the buggy turn sharply , heard the wheel scrape , straighten out , and then roll soundlesslyand evenly over a sod so spongy it could only be moss . Had the boy taken him at his word and turned off onto the trace ? It was hard to believe . He tried to open his eyes but the lids were heavy . No matter . It would only be to meet the burning sky and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scorched , ash fired by the acid sun . He did n't know where he was , nor did he care . He knew enough to be thankful for the shade.  |p103He  could n't tell how long he had been suspended in the timelesslull , when he felt his body resist , lean back against a long descendinggrade . At first it was a slow winding down ; then the turns grew shorter and the way steep . He could feel the animal 's clumsy jogs and jerks but its footing sure . Only a mule , he thought , could step it so . There was only one such descent on the Wilderness trail . Surely he had not come so far . And yet .. . the air rose up from below , heavy and aromatic , drawing the heaviness of his flesh and sopping it up into its invisible but ponderable essence . His face tingled as if he 'd ridden into a web of dew . The cross scents of flowers , blowing and whirling , drenched his burdened lungs ; and , as he spiraled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for breath . And yet for all the density his breath took in , his head felt lighter than a gourd . A sudden wind shook the branches ; and the sunlight ran over the leaves , and the leaves shook themselves in puddles of brightness , fresh-washed , and the light in the April sky like a clean water . But there was no warmth , only the ghost of winter 's sleet to chill the air . Cold drops splashed from leaf to twig . The silence grew immense even as birds and flowers left the woods everywhere unquiet . Clusters of azalea burst from their varnished leaves ; overhung the path to brush the mule 's flanks in colored dew . Wild honeysuckle , the dense laurel set the backward-leaning ridges afire . Through the jasmine roving the steep way , gay in blossom , streaks of color flashed , cut out of the depthless air a continuous silence . Did the birds blossom , the flowers sing ? His senses were all bewildered until , making a turn , he saw down the high columns of trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the pale greenish glade , the dark detached groves and the great bowl of water overflowinginto the cascades of Lost Creek . He could faintly hear but not yet see the waterfall . Now he knew where he was  --  he had come to that region of solitudes , the verge of the deep forest his brothers and sister claimed for their own . But how much longer could they claim it ? Each fall they went on the long hunt which became longer , until the hunt turned intop104hunts overlapping spring , summer and autumn ; and they built a shelter , then another , each begetting its duplicate , each farther from the home place which was too far to come to at last , for rest and curing of the hides and smoking of the hams and salting the meat they had trapped and killed , until they set up house in the Wilderness , on land , claimed by deed and title not theirs but not yet cleared or farmed and on land returned to the state out of tax default , or just abandoned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on the rich land thickets of briar and bush made for varmints and the first trees yet standing . Well , they would just have to come back home for a while . There were ten mule colts to alter , long overdue , and only Duncan could do it neat and clean . He could breed them , break them ; he could n't do everything and besides he got lonesome , and besides it was not up to him to look after all the wild life Julia filled the back lots with . Now that Joe Cree was turning back their land , now they would have to come home ... . the mule stepped down into the bottom at last , into the long sunny funnel , the only opening in the forest pressing close and down and the green air thick and heady , blanched a little where the sun struck the outer density of the funnel 's wall but deep and cool and impenetrable behind . He got down from the mule 's back at the edge of the pool , held the bridle while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped down and sank his mouth and chin into the icy water . He waited for the riffles to smooth out , upon hands and knees , prone like an animal , feeling the sun lay a spot of light on the back of his neck . It sucked at the pool , too , but nowhere did the water 's surface reflectit : which he thought strange as he examined the gelid top , set as lead in a bullet mold , slick in its dull opacity . So , he thought , must the floor of the world have looked on the first day , its patina immaculate in the instancy of creation , that stilled pulsation of the polished film as the instant of time clicked and time began the myriad prick , sprouting . He lowered his gaze ; his eyes sank into marine depths as into ap105translucent jelly , the sun 's radiance suffusing the water 's mass , the water the quiet water distilling out of the fiery penetration light . Above , the heavy green gloom of the mounting forest ; below in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reflection ? He could not tell , for his eyes turned loose in their sockets and fell , dissolving , liquefying the radical verdure from center to circumference , throughout , onewhere and everywhere . And now within the stilled monotony of his clairvoyance he saw the high-branched tree growing upwards from the abyss . As it grew it was grown , but nowhere could he make out where the roots fed , nor could he measure where the topmost branches paused in their growth , except the out-reaching arms , exfoliating , forever fell short of the pool 's ceiling , that thin incandescent transparency between the outer and the inner parts . And then there was a sudden narrowing : the tree diminished ; his vision blurred into a double focus , reflectingthe minute branches of a twelve-point buck . But even as he watched , the horns began to sink within the shadowy substance of two smoky blue orbs . As there they drowned , his sight in reverse action rose to their now unblemished surface . He felt a warm squeeze of recognition : Brother Beverly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up through the murky radiance and seized his own . " Did you bring the salt ? " Beverly 's even self-contained voice shocked him , and he rose trembling . Beverly was standing beside the pool , just across from its narrow part . If he 'd not known where to look , he would have had trouble making him out behind the bush , so well did his hunter 's clothes and the stilled body blend into nature 's growth . " Yes , " he replied . " It 's on the mule 's back . And some black powder . And twenty-five pounds of lead . " As he faced his elder brother , the complaints he had brought fell away , but not from him , rather into the deepest sump of his consciousness , where they sank smaller than the point of a pin but bright as light in a reflecting mirror ; and so , like an essence , impinged upon his senses but did not obtrude . Suddenly he felt his grossness . He had brought with him thep106very smell of stock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaked floor of the barn 's twilit hall , the care of animals , the burden of directing , foreseeing , which is the strain of management . But in his brother 's presence this awareness , even as it tainted him , vanished . As they drew together , he saw fresh scars on one side of Beverly 's face . They had healed but were still raw . The longest had just missed his eye , drooping the lid . He stared at the split features , one part savage as a painted Indian , the other part the brother he loved . " I was calling up a gobbler , " Beverly said . " No gobbler did that . " " Oh , what a love call . I was the very Helen of hens . And I had a perfect blind . Brush washed up behind a down tree . I could hear the noise the beast made , the twigs snapped and I looked up . It sprang into my gaze . " " A cat ? " " A panther . I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too late . " " You killed the bastard ? " " Let him die with all that shame on him ? " He laughed softly . " Lose the witness of my art ? " " Look , Beverly , " he said quickly . " Why do n't you come home ? " " The two of us hunting our meat , and we found each other . The beast slunk away , self-betrayed because he was beast . I came away with knowledge . " " And almost short an eye . " " Almost , " Beverly said . " It 's all there . What 's a little scratch when you know you are king ? " He felt he must speak out , or he would give in to his brother . He said , " Joe Cree is turning back our land . " " At last . " " Somebody 's got to look after it . " " Let Joe Cree keep it . Our cousin loves to lie awake and worry how those who sweat will get their meat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before light , and my meat is always at hand . Is itp107collops of deer ? Quail ? Woodchuck ? Snipe ? The saucy squirrel ? It offers itself . I take what I need . Am I naked ? The summer doe gives me her hide . " All the while Beverly was drawing nearer , until close up he said , " Stay with me , Jack . Duncan and Julia are off on their trails . " His good eye plead their old intimacy ; but then there came a shift and the other eye , drawn and reflectionless , presentedits glazed stare . He shook his head , but slowly . " Sometimes I still need you . " He said , " But it 's our property . Not Joe Cree 's . And you are eldest . " " I know a place , " Beverly said . Resisting , he  --  " It takes money to keep Dickie in medical school . There are taxes . The people must be fed . And Julia . She is thirteen now . Aunt Emm and Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Beverly looked across the pool , towards the waterfall , and the mist from its base seemed to overcloud his sight . " They do n't have to insist . A woman will housebreak anything . The woods even . She 's got pens of quail , pens of turkey ; pet coons , foxes , bred and cross-bred . She 's even got a pen of catamounts . Everything but snakes . She 's put in corn on the commons . " " The commons ? Where ? " " The big meadow . " " That 's no commons . That belongs to that man , Peter Legrand . " Beverly did not hear . " And all around , " he said , " there are nuts and mast and worms and buds . And she pens them up and feeds them . " " You ca n't tell me she 's got Duncan plowing . " " A few of the hands have run to her . " " So that 's where they went . Joe Cree 's been advertising for them . " Beverly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Run from work , you do n't run to a woman . " " Of course she is . I do n't think of our baby sister so . " And then , " What will happen to Duncan ? "  | " It 's already happened . He 's her jailor . That 's what she 's done to the best shot in the family . " " I was thinking of love , " he said softly , but he saw his brother did not hear . He raised his voice . " Our house needs a head . That means you . " Beverly still did n't hear , and he knew he was in the presence of a life such as dreams embody . As in a dream , behind the compulsivebelief in its action , its precarious logic of incorporeal images shifting suddenly but plausibly upon a timeless screen , he followed Beverly into the deep forest , he upon the mule 's back , the first-born walking . The mule was forced to its fastest amble , but his brother kept always the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glide , the glide a flow of silence , so that the trailing mule seemed to sense it and put her quiet hooves more quietly down . At last the flow of their journey , keeping always the same distance , wrapped always in the same stillness , undeviating in its regularity of motion , suspended any sense of motion . In this suspensionthey achieved a singular gravity , enchanted and haunted , so that it seemed to be the forest , not the brothers , which passed , and in passing presented its inmost recesses , the secret abodes of its inhabitants , and he and Beverly with all the privacy of invisible observers , seeing . Gradually this suspension further clarified its meaning , and the meaning passed between them in a cohesion of understanding that needed no speech . They made two halves of a harmonious whole , the more poignant as he recognized in its perfectiona disunity already begun , the chilled stasis of a spasm which will finally sever . His understanding had now surpassed the actual : he was at the mercy of the spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigidity preceding revelation . The trace passing nowhere straight or plain , always sinuous , opening the hidden way while boughs immovably and surreptitiously interlacing , like the petals of a night flower , shut them in from behind . They were trapped but free , as everywhere Beverly untangledthe tortuous maze . He went ahead now like a still hunter , his feet shadowing the ground , turning no leaf , breaking no twig ,  |p109his  spectral cheek gauging a spectral wind . He moved at rapid pace , his dog behind in the old-fashioned way , to be slipped only when the game is wounded . Man and animal avoided the tangled brush , altering no pace to study the ground , knowing where the deer fed and bedded , always seeing before being seen . And never heard . It was not until later , until nightfall when they made camp , if the damp and oppressive green light presaged anything so timely as night , that he , so to speak , caught his breath and in that moment of suspension could withdraw and consider what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done nothing . They had undergone all the stratagems of hunting but no game fell to their hand . What had engaged them was sight . They had seen everythingthe Wilderness had to reveal : the deer in the red pass into the blue ; seen the buck gaunt as if from the strain of carrying the velvet load ; and then the horns sharp and polished , the ground pawed , the haunches fat for rutting . Season melted into season , and each showed its weather . And the weather becoming substance in all that grew in the wilderness , in all that dwelt there . There was the season for treading , another for nesting , another for hovering the young . There was a season for dying . And each came around in its order , and nowhere did the weathers mix . He sensed an urgency in this , but the meaning remained evasive , while about this evasion hovered an expectancy of something which could not be avoided . This induced in him a melancholy heavy with a sense of loss . It was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss he could never recover . Out of the finality of this , its effect upon him , what Beverly had shown was beginning to make its full impact . As they sat facing each other in the obscure light , he could no longer see the scars on his brother 's cheek . His features were whole again with the calm and peace of withdrawal , but a withdrawal into a communion with all things quick and dead . As if to impart this and share it with his brother , Beverly reached to his neck , where around it long thin strips of jerky , running flat to his chest and over the shoulders , made a necklace the color of his clothes , it almostp110seemed his flesh , for the hide he wore fitted his body like an outer skin , as beneath it his muscles , with the slightest ripple , moved in a graft of himself to his animal apparel , himself but transfigured . Ceremonially Beverly took two strips of the dried meat , gave one , kept one . But even as he ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would fail , as it would fail the first-born . He could not accept it , nor its revelation : participation in withdrawal . The meaning at last was clear ; his melancholy and sense of loss were now one . Beverly had chosen a fool 's paradise . The Wilderness had already vanished . There were patches here and there , some delusively big . Already the new man Peter Legrand had gone to fetch his hands to plow up the big meadow . Legrand would spread out ; he was such a man as multiplied . " But there 's Parcher 's Cove , " Beverly said . " It 's a long way away , " he answered . " Shut in by mountains . Only reached from the river . " That smile of the lips , remote , hard , secret , Beverly presented as he shook oh , so slowly , his head . " I go in and out as in my private park . It is close by . Come with me there . The deer have shown me the way in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and he felt himself swaying , as if he were all air , to be sucked into his brother 's will , " even there it will be farmed . " " Not while I am keeper , " the voice whispered . " In time it will be . " " But not my time , " Beverly said as one done with speech . And then he knew that nothing he had heard moved tongue or lip . " The ear , " he thought , " has a metaphysics all its own . " He had now reached a climate he could not interpret . The air made a faint tremor foretelling some distant violence . And then he heard it , as both brothers arose to stand in that dark pulsation which delivers the dawn ; heard the distant hum close by . It was like the faint murmur of insects ; but soon , from some far distantp111ridgetop it drifted clearer ; he was almost sure of it when it lost itself . His body rigid , straining towards the invisible distance , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into . a far expanse . Then it was there , unmistakable now , hounds giving tongue in the chase . The cry was full . By its frenzy he knew the scent to be fresh . But it did n't begin until he smelled it , what brought the cry to the teeth , slobbered the teeth in the cry , the sweet musky promise , the sweet irresistible promising plunge of bone into partingflesh , the scent drowned there in the rich salty turgid flow . It began then , the shaking . His will drew fine as a thread , his body a pile of dust . Somewhere outside he could hear his heart beating . " Be still , " his brother whispered . " It can see the bat of an eye . " Beverly touched him then and from his armpit spread afresh the ravaging scent , immersing them both in the identity-in-essence of the separate-in-form . Like a precious water it restored to him his body . He grew still and waited , but like the tyro he was fixed by the cry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There came a rush of crackling brush , a bounding grace , and the stag was out of the covert , his scut erect , horns thrown back on his shoulders , every branch and tine backward-pointing . With a bound it was in the pool and swimming . The instant it touched water he saw where he was . He had made the circle that had brought him back to the beginning . But what he saw could not be in any season . The stag was in the blue and fat : the antlers thick in velvet . Its hips rose and fell in the water . Its twelve velvet points rocked like the crown of a sapling submerged . At the waterfall it rose towards the persistent roar ; then disappeared beneath the furious foam . Close behind , almost upon it , its nose out of the water at a point , Beverly 's silent hound parted the foam . Then it , too , disappeared . He had heard no shot ; seen no dog slipped . . . he turned in question to his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes met only its emptiness . The trees stood motionless . The pool was empty and unscarred . Only the roar of the waterfall smiting the stone , spattering the mist which rose from itsp112base , only this did he see . Suddenly he knew what it was to be alone and apart in the Wilderness . He opened his lips for comfort , to say he must go to Duncan and Julia , if he could find the way through these treesbut he heard a voice , not his voice , twist his tongueGod , Adam was tricked by sleep . He had no want , to lose the rich horn out of his side . The Garment . He was in the dining room at home . A fire was blazing in the chimney . It was a festive blaze , dry logs mixed with green . They never used the dining room any more , except for special affairs such as the fall hunt . He expected the hunters : yet he knew they had nothing to do with his feeling of expectancy . To perplex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it ought to be April , not November ; that an instant before he had been lost and was trying to find his way out of some strange wood to Duncan and Julia . Or was it Beverly who was lost ? He found himself straining to remember , but all he brought up was a feeling that something had happened ; or that he was waiting for it to happen , not knowing what it could be , only the feeling enlarged out of the swollen condensation of an awaited but delayed parturition . Exactly like butter that wo n't come . In this in-between state he felt himself helplessly poised . But the equilibrium , he knew , would not keep . The becoming becomes . Drop a copper in the churn and , bewitched though it be , it will come . He became aware that his brother Dickie was in the room and that he , too , was waiting . He did not see him ; he felt his presence . He had only to turn to see him , but he had no will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word , a sibilance rather  --  Forbidden . It was like thought hearing , or hearing thought thinking , with no sense to intervene or delay . Or like the pop of burning gas out of the end of a log . He leaned close into the fire , listening . He drew veryp113close , almost into the mouth of the chimney . The flames cast no heat , but he felt no surprise , for the fire grew still as if to give him back the shape of his gazewhich held in its frame the familiar room beyond the flames , Aunt Emm 's sitting room , and she upright in her easy chair , smellingof camphor and knitting . She had on the widow 's cap she always wore . At times the tuft of lace fell upon her forehead like a bridal veil snipped away . The features were filled out , as though she had forgotten time in some close absorption ; but he could see lines and shadows under the chalk she wore . She glanced downwards , and the needles clicked and purled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . He was there , too . This did not seem strange , although he watched from the other side of the flames . " What are you making , Aunt Emm ? " Dickie asked politely . " A shroud , " she said . " But whose ? " Dickie spread his fingers on his knees , carefully lest the cloth bruise them . Startled , Joe Cree looked at his mother and then resumed his pacing . In shining linen , his coat buttoned at the bottom , , he moved with a slow impatience , the well-blacked boots lightly falling upon the carpet . Dickie regarded him gravely , and he Dickie . There was nothing in Dickie 's handsome and placid features that would show the quick and studious mind he had , or his skill in medicine . There was a reticence about him , profound and absolute . " A woman wo n't like it , Dickie , " he said . " It will seem diffidence . " Dickie turned to him and smiled . " I am twenty-three now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped the most , but how unlike Beverly and Duncan for whom they were waiting and who would not come to this house again . " This room seems all doors , " he said . " They save me steps , " Aunt Emm replied . She did not look up from her knitting . " But four ? Do you need so many for this little old room ? "  | " I take so many steps , hunting the servants , " she said . Joe paused and lifted his head . " Mama has put in enough doors for a courthouse . I tell her a high wind , they 'll fly open and the house cave in . " " I can lock , or unlock them . " She was counting her stitches . " I always carry my keys . " Joe glanced towards the hall door . With the air of having waited long enough , he said , " I have turned back your lands . You have the accounts . As you see , I did not do too badly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present for the two brothers absent . There was no way to explain their discourtesy .. . Beverly withdrawn into Parcher 's Cove , never to come out again , giving him , Jack , his share of the estate as a thing of no value , in exchange for powder and lead and salt  --  the first-born refusing the inheritance . How could he make Joe Cree understand , whose life was the care and the increase and the just government of his inheritance ? He regarded Joe , head modestly inclined , listening to Dickie give him thanks , too extravagantly he thought , and felt a renewed respect and affection for Joe Cree , who stood as that strength , that high tower , from which the cross-purposes , the confusionsof life were always brought to hand . That incisive but unharsh voice gave directions so clear and so undoubting that any tangle untangled itself . Or seemed to , for is it not so that any judgment is a snip of the shears : to give is surely to take away . And he saw , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no measure for , that Joe always thought when he cut the knot he was untangling the skein . If he never showed doubt , it was because he had none . This gave belief to others , and so there was order in affairs , if no solution or justice . And it came to him , waiting in that room for something to happen , that if Joe Cree ever doubted , he was damned . " I had hoped , " Joe was saying , " that Beverly would come to his senses . " " The Cropleighs have always been cross-grained , " Aunt Emm said . " Some more . Some less . "  | " But to give away property . Go live with that old half-breed , Parch Corn . He must be touched in the head . " " He takes after Archibald , the Immigrant , " his mother said . " I 've heard pa tell how the old man settled as far from people as he could get , not that such was hard to do in those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they could . The smell of strange sweat was disagreeable to him , he said . The skin is an outdoor kidney , was another saying of his . He never slept in the house . There might have been method in this , for the Indians scalped his wife and children one night . It did n't seem to bother him . He married again right away . " " But he married again , mama . While Beverly . . . if he 's not touched , he 's a fool . Deny your family , you stand alone . Who can do this ? Who but a crazy man or a fool would risk just himself against the world ? Even with superior gifts . A family , even the poorest , is a support for all kinds of frailties and shortcomings . When you go abroad , you carry with you the feeling of something larger than you within you . This is a responsibility . It 's why I say he 's a fool , any man is , to try to stand alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but softly , " He 's just counted himself out , cousin . " " And Duncan "  --  Joe showed no sign he had heard him  --  " he did n't come to fetch Julia . He pretends he ca n't do without her . Of course , he 's scarcely a man yet . " " He 's lining up the hunt with Peter Legrand , " he said . " The Virginian ? " " Yes . He plows the big meadow in the spring . It will be our last hunt there . " " A fine property . An energetic forward-looking man , " Joe said . " I could have bought that meadow at one time , but I did n't have the plows to break it . . . . Yes , a gifted man to do it . " Duncan . What would Joe Cree say if he told him Duncan could not bear to fetch her home ? To see her in another house  --  in any house  --  was to know in all its bitterness her absence . Always Duncanmade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone on ap116hunt ; and always when her visit in town was over , he would come back , and she would be there as if she had never left . It was a deliberate game of self-delusion he played . He said aloud , " Why do the Cropleighs always need explaining ? Being orphans , can we never quite be grown , never having quite been children ? " " Thank goodness , " Aunt Emm said , " you and Dickie show a little of my blood . " " Yes , Jack , " Joe added . " You 've been a father to the rest . " Slowly he shook his head . " Can a brother be a father , when he ca n't even be a brother ? " Joe Cree showed now his impatience . " I have something to ask you both , " he said with easy formality . His voice put a distance between them . " I would like to ask you for Julia 's hand . " In the silence swamping the room they heard Aunt Emm catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined his head , slightly . She looked quickly at her son and away . " Nothing . I 've just dropped a stitch . " Her hands left the needles . She seemed suddenly old . And then they were all rising , waveringly , leaving the room by separate doors . But beyond his door he could not see . It was at that moment he knew it had all happened before . It was like turning back to a page read too fast to get to the end , turning back in the sad surprise to learn there is no end without antecedents . And these you must follow , careful step by step , else the end is a meaningless period . As their shadows withdrew , he leaned forward to see upon what his own door gave ; but met the wavering flames instead , brightening the dining room this November night . And the heat from the fire . He felt it now and drew back . Dickie , his blacked boots spread before him , the neglected toddy in his hand , said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The fire spat and hissed in the dining room . " But is it love ? " he asked . " You mean Joe needs an heir ? " " That too . But I was thinking it 's his way to give Julia what he calls a proper life . We could hardly refuse him . "  | " Why should we ? " " I was thinking of Duncan . " " It 's time to think of Julia . " " Duncan and Julia then . " Dickie took a sip from his tumbler . " Joe is a man of substance . But it 's not that . We could hardly find a better match for our sister . " " Ah , " he said . " Who can tell that ? " He reached for the decanter and poured the liquid into a silver cup . It poured like air . " Once children were spending the day here , boys Duncan 's age . Julia toddled after in their play . It was hard for her to keep up , but Duncan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over places too big , and he scarcely paused in the game , as if she were merely a handicap easy to handle . Once she fell over the horse block and yelled . Never did you see a big brother so tender . He ran and kissed her , brushed her off . In disgust his playmates had to stop the game , and Jesse Bascom jeered  --  Duncan kissed his sis-is-ter ... . Oh , that was the lowest act . The boys were of that age .  --  Yes , I did , Duncan replied , beginning to feel it , the change of attitude .  --  Would you kiss her anywhere ? Jesse asked . Backing a little into the air as into a wall , but holding his ground , his playmates waiting , Duncan said defiantly but feeling his outcast state  --  Yes , I would . He knew , they all knew the next question . I think obscenityis never so surely defined as upon the mouth of a child . It is the ignorant truth of our fallen state , and yet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ass ? Oh , they spitted him there ; they hung him to the tree . He turned his head a little , at bay , but his love was whole and innocent . It was the total presence he loved . He shouted back  --  Yes , I would .... " " But Duncan is a man now , " Dickie said quietly . " Not quite eighteen . " " A man . Brother Jack , you make too much of us as orphans . Who is n't ? You orphan yourself to marry . Or when you leave home . What does it matter , if it came to us a little early , this need to make our lives our own way ? We would have been all rightp118but for Beverly . He thought we could go on playing forever , and what is he ? " " Ah , " he said . " An eccentric . Irresponsible . I like hunting too , but I had sense to train for a profession , with your help of course , " and Dickie smiled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julia 's marriage will make a man of him . " " Does the abandoned hive give up honey ? Is there any bee bread there ? " " Bees swarm . That 's nature . " " I 'm thinking of love . " " So am I. " " .. , and innocence . Of what a jealous godhead could not stand , love and innocence . The timeless estate . Immortality without its burden . Else why multiply sorrow like the sands of the sea . Was not that the promise  --  multiplication , the long division going forwardmaking time ? For must you not divide before you multiply ? Brother and sister you can neither divide nor multiply . " " Speak to the point , " Dickie said wryly . " You know full well there are other needs . " " The body 's needs . " " That 's oversimple . But deny them and you get sickness . The caduceus is two snakes coupling . " " There now . Enter the serpent . Enter mortality . Go love and innocence your separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage . " As if her name evoked his presence , the kitchen door flung open and Duncan was there , framed in the half-dark corner back of the fireplace . He shouted , " A lamp here , " and Isham came running , took a spill from the toothbrush jar next the clock and lighted the big lamp , hanging low to the table . " I wish you 'd come that quick when I call , " he said . " Yessir , but I sees you all the time , " Isham replied and lookedto Duncan . They all looked at Duncan . Dickie slowly drew hislegs back and sat up . He had not seen their youngest brother inp119two years . He was unprepared for the tall slim youth who watched impatiently the flame grow out of its wick . The impatience was all in the slight angle of the head . The long body merely waited , neither erect nor stooped , but lifting out of itself with the supple restraint of a single muscle . Duncan seemed unconscious of having a body at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon . His clothes were old and rusty and stiff with sweat and dew . As the light enveloped him , its milky glow brightened , as if it met a vitality , unspent and virginal , which the hidden flesh exuded . This gave him an added dimension . It could almost be seen , the more since the odor he gave off seemed its odor , rich and clean , the dry damp of the woods , thickened and modified , slowly drawn by the fire to usurp the domestic air of the room . Upon his face , as he watched the lamp , was the total concentration of an animal . The instant the wick grew full he made a soundless movement forward and raised a garment to the light . It was a hunting suit of perfectlycured skins sewed with gut . He regarded it with the surprise of a child who for the first time notices an object apart from himself . His lips worked but he spoke through his eyes . " The skins . Twin summer does . " Dickie got up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother ? " " For Julia . " Duncan confronted his two brothers with a glance , demanding and withdrawn . Dickie , piqued , dropped his hand . Duncan had given no sign of recognition . The image of Julia blocked his sight . He dressed the garment with his eyes . " The traveling cloud , " he said across the table to Dickie . " The burning bush . A limit and direction to the limitless , directionless , the Wilderness in its arid expanse overrolling the horizon , every way . Or that other , the thick wood crowding sight back upon itself . " " Look at yourself , " Dickie said to Duncan . " In the house like this . You 're rude and rough as one of Brother Jack 's jackasses . " And then he knew he must talk , to stop what could not bep120stopped . He said , " Jacks are much misunderstood . A jack may look rough and it be long as your arm , but appearances are deceiving . No maid is shyer . Does he come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bear ? Or crow like the cock , the self-deceiver ? He does not . He 's as dubious before the brute act as if he knew what man and beast had done to love . They 've made it too common , that 's what . You 've seen a slow jack , looking to the right and then to the left , his long ears swinging and his eyes ringed like a clown 's ( although he 's the faery prince bearing the folly of the world in his hide ) and that scent under his nose as thick as honey on the air , making even the flies giddy , and oh , what a sadness at the mounting . " And I know what you think . You think what the world thinks . Well , even if you are my brothers , you ai nt very smart . Let me tell you , though you do n't deserve it , Christ , ca n't you for once take your nose out of your own heart , not to mention lights and livers . Only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's why he 's slow . All jacks . Does that tell you nothing ? The one creature out of all creation that 's slow at it . I do not mention the sloth , God 's one moment of fatigue . You remember that black one , a generation removed from Spain , I paid a thousand dollars for . Oh , how you joked and jeered that I did n't get even a slick dime for my money . And no prince led more carefully to his nuptials . There was no pomp , it 's true , but much circumstance , and just at the beautiful moment a rabbit broke from cover and sped between his hind legs . Down he came and it limp as a bouquet the morning after . Scared by a rabbit ? Overmodest ? These are the plausibilities we fall back on , the overhanging limb we snatch as the flood drags us by . No , it was simply this . He took the only excuse , no matter how frail , to avoid it . " You know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , what of the get of a jack ? Just the mule that does the work of the world , that 's all . And so humbly and with such abuse put on him you 'd think he was an old Christian . Well , he 's older than any Christian . Ask that Queen of Spain who would make no progressp121unless it be behind a span of palomino mules . Trust a Spaniard to know what 's what . Not barbs with pedigrees running back to the flood . But the mule , the divine beast . Noblesse oblige . That 's the mule 's humility . The humbler the person , the lower the bow , and the mule bows to mankind . For it is its sire 's get , and the jackass was the only creature with compassion enough to follow the emigrant out of the garden gates and take upon himself man 's burden . And when those interdicted gates swung to , forever clanging in the common memory , did the jack kick to get back in ? He did not . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard in that bray its folly , for it turned it all to comedy . And not too high at that . Yet all played out in proper diplomatic usage , for the jack undertook the literal burden . With never a complaint . It 's mankind that beats its breast and asks Why . There are no Jobs among jacks , for he 's got an ace in the hole . " And what is that ? " Dickie asked . " It 's the sterility of his get . When the curse bears down , there 's the mule to show the way . Deny the creative act . Stop it : this breeding . Was ever a Divinity so subtly mocked ? And so , my brothers , every time the jack looks slowly to the right and yet slowly to the left , it pales their Essences the Principalities and Dominions and the Angelic Hierarchies , for what is an Essence without its dilution ? Until the Divinity could stand it no longer . Repented . Took upon Itself what It had put upon mankind . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon what did the parents of God flee ? Upon what did He mount His triumph into Jerusalem ? A prancing steed ? A humpbacked camel ? No . The only back equal to His station . That Royal , that shaggy , that divine , that low-to-thegtound , that ass 's back . Ah , what a divine world if all men were jacks . " Dickie looked curiously at his brother . " Is it that bad , brother ? " Duncan , his ears sharpened as if for flight ; but diverted , hiseyes pools of wonder , averted from the garment hanging nowmotionless at his side ,  |p122and  he , lest his plausible tongue , forking the words , slipping , swirling down the ear groove into the eye 's pantomime , should stop , took breath to say more . He was not quick enough . Dickie was already speaking . " We have news for you , Dunk . About Julia . Good news . " " She 's here then , " he breathed . Dickie paused slightly for emphasis . " Joe Cree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least the sounds were made , but sight is sovereign , and Isham had opened the door . " Hyar she , " he said . Julia stood a moment under the lintel , in the fine dress Aunt Emm 's Sewing-Mary had made . Isham , the good servant , had anticipatedhis masters ' wants . He had fetched her to stop the talk , for the servant must have his part too , that vicarious enlargement of the human scene , and the wages high in wonder , if not in pity , where the cost is not his cost . So there she was , and there were the brothers . And they saw her , the child dressed like a woman . But it was not that that took their breath , for even as the instant sped the child was lost in the folds of the garment . Her hair was up , and the upright comb seemed too heavy for the slender , ravishinglypathetic neck . It curved and the shadows lay deep at the fragile nape ; the small hairs too fine for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the faint cleft . She cried , " Bubba , " and in a rushing floating dash flung her arms about Duncan . Then she whirled away , leaving him as inert as a piece of wood , her skirts swelling to fall quietly , surreptitiously , about her ankles , as if they followed some preordained pattern , with the toe of one shoe just showing . And not only Duncan , but all the brothers were transfixed , as she waited in the innocent delight at the knowledge of herself , in the sure sense of it , the intuitive acceptance of the effect she was making , her hands crossed at her small waist , palms opened out , half-cupped , awaiting the bouquet . Oh , innocence , the great ambiguity ! And virginity its paradox . The picture stepped down from the wall into the eyesight , the membrane in shreds , the eye red before the promise , unknown yet known , untouched , yet touching  --  the promise compounded by the familial blood.  |p123She  frowned . " You do n't like my dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dickie said . " But we like you better . " He took her hand and kissed it . Playing the delightful game , she curtsied . " You see , brothers , " Dickie said with smooth gallantry , " what a gift we make our cousin . " With a deft twist of the wrist she was free and before Duncan . " Why do n't you like my dress ? " He did not answer , and she stamped her foot . Duncan 's body gave a convulsive shudder and he stepped back into himself , and out of himself , as if his flesh had that instant both begotten and expelled itself , leaving him trembling in the shock of one born full-grown into his predicament . He made a movement to push her away but grasped her , head half turned , looking before and behind . She gave a short muffled cry of pain , and Dickie shook his arm . " Turn loose , you fool . You 're hurting her . " " Now , now , " he said , coming forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were some light bundle . " Joe Cree 's too close kin . She might as well marry me . " " I 'm not deaf , " Dickie said and his voice was low and soothing , and then he began to talk in his bedside manner , all fresh and new , one almost expected him to show his diploma , saying both medical science and custom saw nothing wrong in first cousins marrying , particularly when the union promised such domestic good to all . He ended upon a lyrical note of deprivation , now they must give up their little sister they loved so well , but that after all by the union proposed , into the family itself , they were really not losing her . He talked on , and Julia , moved by finding such value in herself , said impetuously to Duncan , " Cousin Joe is going to build me a house on his farm . And a room in it for you , Bubba . " Duncan 's voice trembled in sudden despair . " I was going to show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Bubba , " she answered , just aware of his hurt . He deliberately broke the growing strain of sorrow . " Show her , Duncan , what you made for her . " Duncan did not understand . He repeated himself . Slowly Duncan looked down . The garment of skins lay limp and crumpledp124on the floor . He seemed to study it ; then eagerly he picked it up and handed it to Julia , but as she reached to take it , his eyes dulled . And then he was gone by the kitchen door . She ran a little way after him but stopped midways of the room , uncertain what now to do . He gently took the skins and held them under the lamplight . " You can wear it for the hunt tomorrow , " he said . " That will make it up . " Dickie kicked the log and the fire popped and sparked . Duncan stumbled into the moonless night . No wind stirred . The stars were cold bright specks , dripping frost . But the stars streaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so cold up there . And so quick to get there . Out of reach , but sifting the dry frost dust down . In the quiet he could hear it gather at his feet lightly gripping the frozen ruts in the barn lot . How many nights had they been caught out hunting , he and Julia , with a skin below and above , to wake into the glistening iron dawn , their eyelashes rimed over , the fire ash gray , but warm together , the heat of their bodies sealed in by the stiff-biting skins . They could not be felt apart then . It was like sleeping with yourself doubled up , with none of you missing , until the skin opened back , all hard , and the air slid in and you shivered apart , halved but still one . Now they were two , and something between . He stopped all brittle , blinded , Julia swimming before him , the skirts swelling in lighted shade . He widened his eyes , to plunge again into the soot-blue night , to breathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In mild surprise he understood it was the dead weight of his body . He leaned against the barn door , shivering . He had never felt his body before . The night chill , the frosty air , surrounded him , a thin shell enclosing his turbulent flesh . He heard the thump of his pulse , heavy and sullen , and the blood 's breath coil down the spiral of his ear ; but the blood flowing silently gathered into his reins , usurpedp125flesh and bone there . He hit the door with his fists . Let Dickie give her to Joe Cree . She 'll be sorry . He climbed to the loft and , leaning over the dark cleft of the rack , threw hay down , although the peaceful regular crunch of his mare eating rose upon the pleasant sharp smell of the stall . But the odor of the hay was sweeter and he sank back into it , going down into its prickly comfort . Trust Jack to always get his hay in on time . It was the one time everybody had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought how they left this brother so many of the chores and left him alone so long at a stretch . And he felt sorry for him for the first time , for himself too now , who as soon as the mare was done , would ride away deep into the forest where even Beverly had never beenon the edge of the backwater , the trees so high and thick it was like standing among columns , ceiled overhead by branches woven close as a mat . The night he took Julia there he felt small and solemn , and they walked in cautiously as into the place where the secret was . And then from above , so high up he did n't know when it began , or even at first if he was hearing it , the ceiling sighed and groaned ; and the groans hung upside down like bats . He felt Julia pressing close and he put his arms about her . He thought she smelled of fear ; remembered the vinegar they had drunk to keep the mosquitoes off . She stood up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He leaned down to her ear . " It 's the limbs rubbing and touching . " He then put his finger upon her lips , for the turkeys might hear . He knew , he hoped they were clutching their roosts . It was high and they were light sleepers , but he was thinking about how they walked about the Wilderness , keeping all the sounds in place ; and yet their ears were not so sharp as hers . It might be she had surprised the sap working the bark and greening the bud . It was March , and they were in a place no man had set foot before . He had not told her this , only that they were going where the turkeys tnight be less shy . She might have been timid about so private a place . They had set themselves to make the turkey give up all his ways . Of all the creatures he guarded best his nature . A rabbitp126was smart , but he courted in the open and you could bring him out of a hollow log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long the race , always treed . The deer had runs and feeding grounds and beds well marked as a town full of streets . Wild pigeons came in droves to block out the sun , but when they roosted , you could pick them from the trees like apples . But the turkey , now , they had watched the seasons round , and what they knew was a lot , only you could n't count on it . You 'd go to a roost and they would n't be there . Or they would be . He had practiced their calls , and they had come into the round of his rifle pea and died there . Or they would answer the hour long and never show , or hesitate just beyond a safe range . And why was that ? Was it the ear or the eye , or did its beak lip danger out of the air ? And the hermit gobbler , who never yelped nor answered yelp , lonely as God , whom no man had seen fly from his perch , or hen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest , he moved , wrappingits mystery in his cunning . . but now they would have turkey meat , turkey knowledge maybe . It was the beginning of the mating season , when the gobblers are reckless , their wattles bursting with love , their feathers spread for glory , courting bold . At first the hens are cold . Later at his treading ground the hens would come and keep coming long after he is skin and feathers and would be let alone . But the hen fat on love ca n't get enough . He thought on this , as he and Julia waited , the dark swimming around them , the night air vibrating with the stretch of day , this waning of the male and waxing of the female . Not too far off a barred owl screeched  --  the rusty wheel of night was moving away . He stepped in front of Julia and led her towards her blind . They walked carefully  --  there was plenty of time  --  the owls would keep it up alone for a while . He had a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the worst kind of dark , just before it thins itself . He had learned to fix a thing or place well in mind ; then let feel do it . And it never failed . He got her placed and she followed his mute directions , mostly by touch , which wayp127to turn , where to rest her gun . She was loath for him to leave her and he to go , she so small , a little splash of darker dark in this close cave he had brought her to , for so it seemed , except no cave smelled so rich . She put her arms up and brought down his ear . " The owls just started , " she whispered. and so he stayed . He had never known her to mind taking a stand alone . It was n't fear . It must be where they were , deep down and away from everything , shut off , with no inlet nor outlet .. . the spongy cold off the ground made his feet ache ; he was out of season with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood and the earthmold rolled sluggishly , coming up damp but smelling dry . It came to him then that they were standing on all the days of the world , and this day coming swelled fresh out of the rot of all those others . How strange for him to think such a thought . It rattled him a little . Maybe they should n't have come here . Then he felt it , the night leaving his cheek . He 'd better go . He touched his sister to let her know and softly threaded his way to his own blind twenty yards behind . That would give her that much closer range , since he would do the calling . He was none too soon . The wing beats and lonely cries of the ducks lifted off the water beyond the glade . If he and Julia could only stay like this forever , she never go to Aunt Emm 's ; if that Pete Legrand had n't come to the great meadow ; he was all right , he guessed , but he acted as if Julia was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . . . there was the thrasher in the canebrake . . . he must stop his mind from wandering and think what the turkeys would do , now the small birds were chirping . The day was coming fast . He took out his wing bone and licked it . His hearing was all at the mouth of his ear . . . the trees appeared like ghosts of themselves , black ghosts , a gray squirrel chattered briefly . . . the world sucked in its breath and held it . The silence was absolute . Overhead a stream of gobbles , and in its wake sound rushed back . All things grew solid . In the east off where he could not see it , the sun was up . He raised the wing bone to his mouth and gave three quickp128yelps . There , a gobbler answered . Overhead he could hear the puff and scratch of wings . The fool was trying to strut on his perch . Above and around now , unseen , he could feel the gliding silence of the turkeys leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait , there it was over to the right of Julia , the yelp from the ground and the burst of gobbles . He held just the time and answered . The game was on ... he was drawing the bird toward the small glade and the pea of Julia 's rifle . All things held in the secret light ... the watery air was spawning . Kneeling he watched through the knothole of a rotten limb which curved before his blind . His eye detached itself to see ; it drew the serpentine neck up through the tender shrub . The neck swayed erect , pointed its beak and slowly turned that one bright eye . The eye swelled for an instant , filling his own . He froze , his lungs closed ; his sight fused with the liquid glint , sank into the savage pool , the oily glitter of the abyss , depthless , endless : nothing : the all-pervasive waters . At the eye flick the knothole turned empty . Now he plainly saw the beak , the serpent-like head of the turkey turning until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if the air were its sheath , the neck sank among the budding leaves . He released his breath : the bush shuddered with a spray of gobbles , rich , loud , and close . His tingling lips gave again the soft quick tremor three times . Instantly the invisible bird returned an impatient , imperious reply . Promise of love filled the narrow glade , and then out of the cover at last sailed a rush of feathers gliding sideways . Tail spread , putting , wings snapping as they scraped the ground , head sunk back , wattles gorged red and running purple , the bird began to tread its dance . It turned , it stamped , its wings plowed the loose pliant earth . It faced in all its glory the direction of the teasing sound . Its coarse black beard stiffened upon its breast . In a swooping charge it came with a rush , as the rifle cracked once . For an instant the wattles glowed like the wounds of love ; then quietly the bird fell among its collapsing feathers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the ground had burnt it . Its spasms stilled ; it looked now only half its size . But the gobbles still resounded in the glade . Cautiously he leaned over his blind , saw Julia 's half-risen form sink down . He understood  --  another male was on the ground challenging . He gave a quick call as the second bird rushed from cover and bore down upon the stilled form of its rival . Drawing nigh , it changed its posture and began to strut , complaining in impatient demanding liquid tones . It jumped sideways and struck with its feet the lifelessbody . Its song was like water splattering a hollow tube of glass . Then the rigid wings enclosed the downed bird and the feet began to tread . Slowly Duncan looked down the pea of his rifle . He fired at the wing joint . When he reached the spot , Julia was already there . They looked at the two dead males in silence . " What was he doing ? " Julia asked strangely . " Treading , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " They 'll do that , " he said . " And dead , " she said . She looked at her brother soberly . " Maybe to be down . Maybe that 's it , " he said at last . " Maybe it 's the shape only that counts . " They seemed not to know what to do . " And all along it was nothing but a call , " she mused . " Breath and a wingbone , " he said . " Bubba . " She spoke quickly . " I know . The gobbler has n't got any sense . The hen comes to no call . We 've got to find where she hides her nest . Then we 'll know . " As he looked at his sister , her expression eager and excited , he felt it was she , not he , who was now their guide and he felt she had brought them to a boundary he did not know how to run . She was wiping the mosquitoes absent-mindedly off her face . " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birds . " " I would n't care for them now . "  |p130She  looked at him in surprise . " You 're going to leave this meat for varmints ? " He hesitated ; then he leaned over to do her bidding . It seemed to him that already an odor of corrupting bodies ' was tainting the air . The Chase . It had been a long day and a good hunt . The trophies , tied by their heels , hung from tree limbs and the heavier saplings . In the violence of their displacement the deer festooned the camp site like offerings . Their branching heads , stilled at last , prodded the haze of night rapidly advancing off the great meadow . The hunters with quiet impatience breathed in the aroma of venison stew , or they idled at the spring , cleaning themselves . Only Duncan stood off from the others , upon the edge of the bare and rolling meadow . " Wash up , Dunk , " Dickie called to him . " They 'll be in . " Duncan gave no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came and stood beside him . He , too , looked where Duncan looked . He said , " A wounded buck will run far , when pressed by horse and dog . " " Something 's happened to her , " Duncan said . " You could n't lose Julia in the woods . You know that . Besides , Legrand is with her . " " That son of a bitch , " Duncan said , and then more quietly , " Which way they take off ? " " The Big Hopper waterfall . " The twilight was fast fading . Duncan had night eyes , but at this hour no matter how he strained to see , Jack thought , he must feel his sight disperse . Twilight , the chameleon hour , when a man does well to hold his breath . Duncan said , " I thought she would follow me . " He tried to hide his despair.  | " I do n't see why you thought it , " Jack said in careful reproof . " You were mean to your sister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She acted all right . " Duncan spat at the ground . " Like a bitch in heat . " " Hush , now . " A voice called , " Stew 's ready . " After a while Jack said , " We 'd better eat . They do n't come in soon we 'll need a little food . " " You eat . " Duncan 's voice dropped . " She looked naked . The suit was too tight . " The words were so low they seemed a thickeningof the breath . " Well , you made it for her . " " She did n't have to wear it . " " She wanted to please you . " Jack turned for emphasis . " Yes . She tries to please everybody . Joe Cree . Legrand . . . " " Let 's go eat , " Jack said . " You eat . I 'm not hungry . " They were not looking at each other but into the great meadow , its burnt-over highlands rolling in darkness now deeper than the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moist to burn ran their courses like rivers on a map . It was hard to believe that these grassy streams had hidden the deer which had made the chase , ending in the campfire , the comforting pipe after meat , and a sleep proper for man . This sleep , he knew , neither he nor his brothers were likely to get this night . The swathes of grass had bounded with another chase which would lead them far , how far he dared not think . A few stars were showing hard and bright . The moon 's quarter was late and Julia 's eyes were not so good as Duncan 's . Perhaps after all she and Legrand had had to make camp . . . perhapsJack turned away in his kind of haste , nothing abrupt , a longer surer stride . He would eat a bite and prepare Dickie . Duncan would not wait much longer . He walked into the pleasant glow of the campfire , flickering the bare branches , holding the frost andp132darkness at bay . The bright lift of food 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the hunters were quiet . One or two looked speculatively at Jack . Eddie Dunbaugh said , " They ai nt no worry . Blindfold her , she would n't lose . " Pete Legrand 's two servants were bending over with coffee , the hot dark vapor flaring their nostrils , steaming the open-mouthed cups . He blew into his to cool it . Dickie idled up . " What do you think ? " " I think we 'll ride all night . " " We wo n't find them that way . " " I know . " " Joe Cree , now , " Dickie mused . " He should have come . " " Business before pleasure . That 's our cousin , " Jack said carefully . " The trouble is he do n't always know his business . " Dickie thought a moment . " I suppose if your sawmill burns you have to go . " " And look at the ashes to tell you what you already know , that you 've lost money . Meanwhile . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the woods , with your rival . Maybe he do n't think he stands to lose there . " " Rival ? " " You 're spilling my coffee . " " Legrand was merely trying to divert her . He 's a gentleman , and Duncan was cruel , turning her pets loose . " " Maybe he was , and maybe Pete 's a gentleman . But gentility 's got a daylight look . Did you ever see anybody bow in the dark ? Did you ever look for a gentleman at midnight ? In what quarter of the night do you find him ? For that matter , who ever saw more than the natural man at daybreak ? " Dickie interrupted impatiently , " Surely you 're not ... " " There goes Duncan now , " Jack said , " to saddle up . Be sure to bring your medicine bag . " " You think we may need it ? " " Just bring it . "  |p133And  yet he knew when earlier they had ridden in for the hunt and saw the desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skins would bring her back but knowing better , not even hoping but willing it , for when was hope ever purer than in the certainty of loss . And there she was wearing them , but wearing better the light grace of her seat upon the shell of leather , holding the bridle with a refinement of control , as if it were the horse 's mouth that moved her wrists . . . waiting for Duncan to lift her down , his behavior of the evening before forgotten and forgiven . But none of this did Duncan see . He saw the too tight garment shaping too plain the woman in the girl . He whispered in low fury , " It 's too small . " She watched his features flush with shame . " But , Bubba , " she said , her blue eyes dark with hurt . And then Pete Legrand lifted his hat , " Miss Julia , let me show you where I 'll raise my dwelling house . " The night had by now everywhere closed down , and the meadow spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shied . They understood they had to go , had settled down . Duncan leaned slightly forward in his saddle , guiding the brothers . Horses and men seemed no more than moving shadows , but the hooves made a solid sound , the leather creaked . In all the broad meadow these were the only sounds . Once Jack looked back . From afar he could see the small glow of the campfire , flickering in the immensity of the night . Even as he watched , the fire flicked out . " This is your fault , Duncan . You know that , now , " Dickie said , but the falling hooves muffled the words . Perhaps Duncan heard , but his stubborn posture could be felt , only that , his neck and shoulders reaching forward into the edge of invisibility , as if his will and fatality , at last conjoined , traveled there , outside himself , forever balanced upon an invariable distance whose mathematics he alone could decipher . " The anonymous dark . The blind touch , " Jack said . Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking the palings , and through the gaps the frightened pets had sped ,  |p134flurrying  the yard in feathers , parakeets greening the late daylight , turkeys gobbling and trotting , and up whirred the quail , rising upon planes of air ; the mother fox in her false den waiting , the bright eyes of the little ones slyly a-glitter behind , beasts and fowl all mixed until the cat sprang into the eye of the peafowl 's tail , and Julia leaping from her mount to catch Duncan 's arm . He . lowered the axe slowly and together they watched wonderingly the woodchuckrise straight up , into the bare limbs . Then Duncan , moving his stiff lips , What do you want with these now ? You think I 'll feed them , while Joe Cree tumbles you in his arms ? " Had n't we better holla ? " Dickie asked . They rode along . " You do it , " Duncan said . " They could pass , and we not know it . " " Holla , if you want to . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and into the pure thin brittle November night rose that cry , the high long wail abruptly cut off , urgent , melancholy , that single vestigial call of beast turning human , crying to its kind in the primodial wastes . A horse stamped its foot restlessly . Dickie called again , and listened . " Well , you ai nt forgot how , " Jack said . They rode on until they met a wall of thicker dark . Along this Duncan took them until he found an opening among the trees . They entered in single file , Duncan before and Jack behind . He noticed almost at once the difference in the air . Riding athwart the meadow , although there was no wind , he had felt the cold stream through his clothes as through a sieve . He sensed now not a warmth exactly but a closeness ; he could feel the bare trees weaving their tangled arms overhead , cutting up the firmament and , if not lessening the chill , fixing it to limbs and twigs in patterns of invisible foliage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer aware of his inner garment . This would have taken time ; yet the change seemed almost instantaneous . This meant they traveled now the dark night wood , where the mind floats out ofp135season , in its own ichor , oblivious of time and blood . Blood , the streaming filament of time ; yet , close in the privacy of its incestuous tube , it knows no time , flowing like a ghost through the two walls , birth and death . But it can harden , too , and blacken . A slit , a rent , a breath of air will do it . This he knew , as well , the mystery and the act . They must have wandered off the trace , bewildered without knowing it , for three hours ' riding should have brought them to the waterfall . Instead it appeared out of the murky haze of first light , a wide dark tongue plunging into the pool 's thick smoke . Its roar , for a while , muffled tongue and ear . They sat their mounts upon its edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The horses sighed , and he now smelled the horse smell . They were good blown . Duncan'seyes had strayed into his own bewilderment . " Look , " Dickie said wearily . " Cut to pieces . " At the edge of the mist lay Pete Legrand 's young dog . Its bowels had been ripped out and trampled . All around it were the hoof marks of the buck . Duncan was down , examining the tracks from the woods to the opening . They were well marked in the moist ground about the pool , even the print of the dew claws showing . A few crumbs of dirt had fallen down the sides into the tracks ; a leaf stained with frost  --  he did not need these signs to tell him they had been made the afternoon before . The dog 's body was sign enough . It was the print of the horses ' hooves which puzzled them . They , as well as the buck 's , came to the edge of the pool and disappeared . Duncan walked the trace where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But where ? " he asked at large . They did not have long to wait for a guide . Before their eyes the mist solidified into the bow of a skiff floating out of the frosty vapor , with Beverly upright , dark from the wet , his hands dragging the long pole . He leaned forward in slow rhythm and gave one long push . The prow made a languid spurt towards the bank . It was the very movement of silence as it came to ground , with scarcely a jar or knock . The water lapped about its bottom , and then the water lay as slick as a pane of slate . Beverly did not greet hisp136brothers . He waited in the skiff , holding the pole like a staff , and his kin held back before the strangeness of him . They had ever seen him smooth-cheeked . A beard now roughened his face and the moisture gave it a greasy look , but it was his glance which shocked them into silence . It offered no communion whatever ; no memory of blood or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to brother . Appalled , they regarded him ; then the mist whirled down upon his eyes , like a hood . Out of this his voice , rusty and strange , " Hobble the horses , and git in . " Duncan burst out , " But where are they ? " " Git in , " he said . Dickie sat in the boat , hugging himself from the chill . Jack pushed off and jumped into the stern . Duncan , standing behind their ferryman , entirely masked him , so that as Beverly made the long slow swoop with the pole , his body seemed to bend out of Duncan 's side , as if Duncan were dividing himself . They glided into the enveloping mist . Shadow and substance , Jack thought , as the rhythm of the stroke brought Beverly back . The two-in-one , he continued , but in this cloudy travel who has substance , where the outward sight is dispersed and returns upon itself ? Do they see the end of this , or only the floating haze ? Then Duncan gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterfall growing and knew the coffin-shaped boat was making for it . The mist boiled out of the roar ; the roar out of the waterfall , a sheet of liquid rock spilling into the frothy base . The skiff made rapidly towards it . Dickie looked back at Beverly in sudden alarm , then ducked as the skiff shot through . At first they were aware only of the muffled falling , its steady sound , and that they had gone back into the dark , as they sat in the boat beached upon the dry dirt of the hollow room behind the waterfall . Beverly gave them little time for wonder . He led them to the back of the room which narrowed into a close warm passage . Along its broken and stony bottom he advanced easily , as one long familiar with the way . But his brothers followed haltingly . Jack slapped at the wall to keep from falling . It was cold and slimy . Ilep137quickly withdrew his hand and wiped it on his shirt . Ahead he could see they were moving towards a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch them steadily , indifferently , as if already they were threading it . With a small surrender he trusted Beverly to guide him along the passage , narrow yet plainly wide enough for man or deer , indeed for a horse . Julia and Legrand must have happenedupon the buck as he cut the dog to pieces with those flickeringhooves , seen him swim under the waterfall , and in the heat of the chase followed . Perhaps they thought they would find him , at last spent from his wound , in the dry scooped-out place behind . What did they think , what consultation hold when they found themselves in that empty hollow , behind the falling water ; and which one , he or she , first noticed the cleft in the rock , and the passage ? Did it promise some rare adventure , some mystery , this animal sanctuary , which Beverly thought he alone could claim ? And did they have to blindfold the horses ? The eye widened ... . It showed plainly now what it was , the outlet into Parcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of dawn . But it was still muted , and the brothers stood upon the rocky platform and looked down into the cove . A path , well worn and the dust of it stirred by hooves and paws , coiled between the boulders and shattered limestone to the floor down in front of them . Their sight was broken by the bare trees , except to the left where a cedar grove spread itself as far as the eye could see . The gray light , imperceptibly swelling , turned the evergreen boughs a dark purple . One large female tree stood out of the thicket . Its waxy berries , opalescent , picked up the light and the tree glowed like a tremendous fern in the shadowy low ground . The brothers ' sight now came to rest upon what they had already seen , the buck hung to a sapling and drawn by a throng up to and over a limb of a post oak . Duncan could not take his eyes from the buck . It hung , upside down , in the ignominy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or did he follow the buck as it turned from its trampledp138enemy , the plaguing yelps at last silenced , to see the waterfall that hid the secret place as it showed the way ? Did he follow it in his mind as it plunged into the pool to swim under the falls , into the muffled silence behind , to sanctuary at last , to the lassitude of triumph before its knees gave and its rapid heart fluttered to a stop ? Or did the buck merely serve for concrete sign that Duncan 's search was near its end ? Did he need to hold back to gather himself as his brothers began the descent ? He remained withdrawn even as he overtook them in his catlike glide ; but at the small piece of new ground which they quickly reached he was full alert . Four other bucks hung from the trees upon the rim of the clearing . The horns of one almost touched the ground , as if the killers , tired or satiated , had grown impatient of their tasks . It could be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with salt and the ground about stamped and scuffed . Duncan was breathing heavily . Beverly said in a mumbling fury , " It 's murder . That 's what it is . " " She is all right , then , " Dickie said evenly . " I learned my pets to let me watch them lick the salt . Them two was bound to know they was pets , to get so close to shoot . " Duncan had already heard the stamp of the horses . He had found the short trail leading into the gloom of the thicket . Only he , whose sight had been trained to detect movement and not its object , could have seen the wisp of smoke . It was a short way in to the triangular glade . The cedar trees were big and gray with age . His brothers found Duncan stopped before the dead fire , as at some barrier he could not possibly cross . They passed to either side of him , walking carefully over rock splinters and the moss . At the base of the glade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boughs . She was upon her back , her head resting lightly upon his arm . A bearskin came up to their middles . He was turned towards her , his free arm around her waist , the fingers sunk among the green cedar boughs . Their sleep was deep . As if the brothers had opened the way , daylight began to suffusethe glade . Their heads bowed down , the brothers made a rough circle about the two . At last her eyelids fluttered , opening freshp139and clear , without the film of sleep . She regarded her brothers gravely , as if it were only natural for them to be here , and then , almost casually , she looked towards the dead fire . A shadow passed her brow . Quickly she turned her head and hid it against Legrand 's chest . The look and the recoil was instantaneous . It released Duncanat the rim of the fire 's ash . He teetered , as if balancing precariouslyupon the edge of a precipice . His mouth hung slack , his eyes were set . Then his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashes , and as he righted himself he had the Mexican barlow out of its sheath . Julia had scarcely touched Legrand 's chest before she was up , in front of him , looking small . Legrand sighed and stretched his legs , lazily . " I 'll alter him , " Duncan groaned , plunging . Beverly met him . " Hold now . We 'll do this here thing right . " He was matter-offact . He turned his back on Duncan and faced about . Dickie had taken Julia by the hand and led her out of the way . She followed like a disobedient child . Legrand was up now but in the daze of sleep . Slowly he ran his hand through his tousled hair ; shook his blond head . He looked from brother to brother . When he had made the circle , he was thoroughly awake . Without a word he stripped off his shirt . He cast it aside . He said , " Which of you will it be ? " Beverly stepped out of the way . Duncan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them loose and then stood bare to his belt . Beverly waited until the shirt had settled to the ground ; he seemed to reprove the haste ; then , " You 'll hold hands , and cut till one or the other falls . " He spat as if a splinter had got in his teeth . " And listen . I do n't want any of you ever in here again . Fergit you know the way . Parcher 's Cove is my beat . " It seemed strange to think at such a moment that this would be the last time Beverly would act for the family , and then he saw how white Duncan 's skin was . Legrand was darker , a trifle heavier . Hisp140blond head made him seem darker still . Very simply he spoke , " I would like to say . . . " " You ai nt got nothing to say , " Beverly interrupted . " I 'll say it anyhow . " He turned to Julia . She was not far away , but he looked , it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more luck in this . I 've loved you from that first day . " She straightened her small bony shoulders , understanding at last what was about to take place . But it was too late . Dickie 's grip tightened on her wrist . The two youths were advancing towards each other , Legrand remembering to slip the knife from his belt only after he had taken his first step . He held it up and before him . It had a thicker blade than Duncan 's . They advanced slowly , warily . From the first they had joined their eyes . As they met , there was a moment of uncertainty . " Hold hands , " Beverly ordered . Slowly , fumblingly , since they could not look , their hands reached for each other . Their fingers touched as tentatively , as gently , as lovers . With a thrust they slid into the clasp . There seemed to be something outrageously improper in the clasp of two left hands . " All right , " Beverly ordered . There was an instant ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his crotch . Legrand was a little slow to parry , but his blade caught the other blade at the navel . But not to hold . Deflected , it slipped across his belly . A line as thin as a new moon appeared on his flesh . It darkened ; opened wide as a mouth belching , and his guts began to spill . He turned loose , caught them , still facing Duncan with his knife at parry ; then he grunted and stepped back . Wonderingly , he held the dull slick coils writhing in his arms . His gashed middle smoked in the chill of morning . He looked up in appalled surprise and carefully sank to his knees . " The flaming sword , " Jack whispered . " It was there all the time . " Julia thrust her hand to her mouth . Dickie beckoned to Jack and gently gave her to him . He picked up his satchel and walkedp141deliberately to the stricken youth . " Lie back , " he said briefly . " Do n't let them touch the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there any water ? Jack , pour your whiskey over my hands . Beverly , how far is Parch Corn 's ? Get some cover and bring it back . Skins . Blankets . Anything . Plenty of it . And make haste . " He was carefully , skillfully replacing the intestines . Instead of obeying , all but Duncan watched the deft rapid fingers at their work . Julia had quietly drawn near and was holding Legrand 's hand . He was sweating and breathing hard , his sight pitched far into the cedar tops . Dickie was threading his bodkin with gut . " Give him a bullet to hold in his teeth . You , Duncan , build up the fire . " " Let the hog lie in his guts , " Duncan said sullenly . His knife was still in his hand . It had no blood on it . Dickie looked briefly over his shoulder . " You do exactly as I say , " and then , hovering , he began to stitch the wound . After a while he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , reasonable , soothing , kept time with his hands . " We can repair as best we may our neglect of our sister . She must marry Joe Cree right away . I 'll convince him . It wo n't be hard to do . Beverly forbidsus Parcher 's Cove . " He paused ; tied off a stitch ; continued , " We 've never been here . Remember that . Legrand was thrown and hurt . Duncan and I stayed behind to tend him . That 's the story you will take back to camp , Jack , when you take Julia . And take her now . Julia , you must do your part too . " He marveled how well she dissembled , telling her story quietly , answering questions with ease , putting an end to questions by invitingthe hunt to break up at their place . If they would help load the game , she and Jack could go ahead and make ready . . . . " I 'll hold the lines , " she said . " You can doze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the wagon rolled out the quietude of the trace . The quiet enveloped team and wagon , whirling slowly upon the turning hub . At the center of its lidded eye he watched the silence spin out an invisible corridor , down which the vehicle traveled , as the team settled into a pulling walk up the long gradep142of Penter 's Hill . At the top they would reach the turnpike where it made the big bend between river and town , and where it straightenedout the home place would show itself , seated above the pike and rolling field  --  then journey 's endthe vehicle came to a halt , suddenly . The shafts ran forward , jerking his hat offThe heat poured down . The August heat . Knowing , not knowing , he grabbed for his hat . In that moment his consciousness retained its timeless spaceless plight : the long corridor he had traveled hung upon his sight ; then his misty eyes blotted it .. . and there was the caked back of the horse , steaming ; the buggy waited before the tollgate which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southwest a few white clouds had gathered ; a darker cloud , coming between the August sun and ground , made a sudden shadow on the pike . He held in this moment of pure clarity the knowledge of what corridor he had passed down , the long spiraling where vision reveals its essence , illumining the senses as it sheds their hulls until one sense , sovereign , refined out of natural usage , remains . His awareness focused upon this clarity , forever instantaneous , history the sun 's blind light . He had the feeling , that long pause , of reaching towards this truth ; almost he could put it together when the muffled sobs of the boy intruded . " Now then , Lucius , " he said , half turning towards him . And then he turned and looked directly at his nephew . Even now he found it hard to banish that other image , that companion of another time , another journey . . . the gateman was advancing . He saw Lucius could not abide the words forming in the bleary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave the sign to hurry . The ancient 's eyes were milky ; slowly they blinked as they took his meaning . Yet the amenities called for no haste . " Hit 's a-fixing up to rain , " the gateman said , unwinding the plowline from its peg . The palsied hand tolled out the line at last ; the gate polep143rose to unbar the way . Lucius shook the lines ; he shook them again . The horse sighed and slowly stepped over the boundary . They drove a little way when Lucius spoke harshly . " It 's my fault , " he said . " Hush , boy . Hush , " he said , startled . " When I did it up there with that girl , I knew . I knew something bad would happen . " The horse , feeling the comfort of the cloud 's shadow , sensing too the familiar stall , picked up its steps . Jock showed that all his attention was on the muffled clop of the hooves , and then the words broke from his mouth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do you dip up water and find the source of the stream ? Will the pulse count betray the heart 's folly ? " The Lumber Inspector . " He put me on my honor . That glorified peckerwood sawmill man Cree put me , Hopgood Schott , on my honor . All the other peckerwoods I 've stole lumber from try to out-tally you and do n't know a windshake from a pinhole . I thought I knew the sawmilling game . Me , Hopgood Schott , sent into this country because I knew the finer points of the business , put on my honor . That 's a laugh but it ai nt . The firm had even raised me , that is for the finer points not the honor . I did n't earn the raise but I took it . Like any man I take what I can get . How do you think the big shots got theirs ? Nobody gave it to them and nobody ever gave anything to me . I mean to be a big shot myself . I thought I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walks under not any tree but the biggest , the tallest , the tree the whole country locates itself by , and lets it fall on him . " That 's why I 've come to you , Mr. Legrand . I know with you it 's strictly business . I 've a little proposition that will make us both some money . " He paused to get his breath and bearings . The man Pete Legrandhad not moved since Schott presented himself in the small office of the flour mill , except to say  --  State your business , sir . Not even for death did this Pete Legrand give a neighborly  --  Well , now that 's too bad . Only the eyes waiting , eyes speckled as a perch fresh out of water , waiting while he , Hopgood Schott , scuttled through the pause he had allowed for death , which common decencydemanded , and the pause seeming never to end and the eyesp148skinning him , accusing , so that he had blurted out  --  He put me on my honor . Now again he waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat dusted with flour , the square-toed boots and the blond hair standing up like a comb , unmoving , suddenly brushed his hand across his chin , and did it tremble before he jerked it away and walked to the office door ? The door closed carefully upon the hollow cavern of the mill , upon the silence of August and drought and a dry millrace , upon the boulders in the river bed flaking mud , the river a sluggish branch twisting among greenscummedpuddles , pocking the mud slick as satin , cracked by the sun . And the sun hovering beyond the small window , a thin glaze upon the panes , glazing the dust as light as drying mold . Pete Legrand took a chair ; motioned him to another . " Yes ? " he stated . " It was n't only this honor , Mr. Legrand . I would have seen through that in time , but he knew how to keep things moving and the costs down . That 's what fooled me . Any firm wants that . And he did it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did have a woods boss name of Leatherbury , a lean sour old bastard but could he cut trees . Wham , wham , wham  --  timed like that , I never did see him split a tree . No , sir , this Cree was the whole show : bookkeeper , timekeeper , inspector , buyer , seller . . . and carried it all in his head , and I mean carried it . I 've seen him settle with his hands , tell them where they had been , what they had been doing or making out they were doing it every day of the week . If one of them did n't do his duty , that 's what he called it , he gave him his time . He did this so easy , never raised his voice and you did n't have to lean over to hear either , sitting on a log , straight as a poplar , figuring on a piece of board or the back of a paper sack with the smell and the cheese grease fresh on it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you had n't seen him . " " I know ; I knew Joe Cree , " Pete Legrand said . " No trouble to find him . At the last tollgate the woman who took my quarter  --  I always keep the right change ready for thosep149girls , you give them a bill and they 'll fumble a whole day to the bottom of that apron pocket and bring up , one at a time , the nickels and dimes and coppers smelling of snuff and that other odor , and looking out at you from the shade of that black slatted bonnet , the eyes all a-glitter with some bad end for you . I do n't like them and I do n't like the smell of snuff , but , boy , I 'm polite to them . This one said  --  You looking for Joe Cree 's sawmill ? I nodded .  --  You the fellow going to take up his lumber ? I thought that come under the head of my business so I said  --  If you could just direct me . They all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worm informationout of you .  --  He 's cut right smart boards , she went on and I did n't ask her how she knew , never having moved any further than from the kitchen to the gate porch , but I was patient and a horsefly at my livery stable nag and the nag a little wild .  --  If you will just tell me , I said . Well , when she had only got out of me my name , where I was from , who I worked for , how much money I had in the bank , who I slept with last and was it good , finally she volunteered  --  The mill sets nearabout that there tree . That was a good one , I thought , really good , a sawmill by a tree . But then I looked up and over and saw it , its top rising up the side of a hill , I did n't believe it , I thought it was a small tract of timber , or the seed tree of the world . So I thanked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there as if I had told him the exact second to meet me . You generally waste half a day finding your man and another eyeing each other like two stray dogs , but I looked up and there he was striding towards me and I had no more pulled up before he swung his leg over the wheel and held out his hand , all in one motion  --  Mr. Schott , he said , like he was handing me my name . Then he spoke to the horse  --  Go on , sir . " Yes , sir , there he came towards me in that brisk military stride , as if that morning he had calculated just the second it would suit him , for me to be there to make the swing around the woods and mill and no time lost . It never occurred to him that my ideas about getting there or time or interference would make any difference , me who had got on the cars a hundred miles and fiftyp150tons of cinders away , changed twice , missed one train and lay over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteen miles , stopped at four tollgates , he had calculated that too , and before I had time to take a drink of water we were up on the stacks . " My policy with the peckerwoods is to lower a board a grade . He said  --  Whoa there , like I was a horse . That 's a good clear board , he said . I got short with him .  --  It 's a number two , I said .  --  Throw it out , he said . I had expected a little argument . They generally talk big but wind up taking my grade . But not him , not Captain Cree . He just said  --  Throw it out , and out it went . About an hour of this and we had more boards out than tallied . I was stumped . I had been told he had everything tied up down to his winter underwear on this tract of timber , and there 's no quicker way to go broke than at the sawmilling game . " You ever hear about the broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this man . This man and this devil made a trade . I 'll go to hell , this man said , if you 'll give me anything I want while I 'm upground and kicking . What do you want , the devil asked . Enough money to run a sawmill without going to the bank . I 'll give you a million dollars , the devil said . The man shook his head . The most beautiful woman in the world . The man shook his head , a little slower , but he shook it . Sweat commence to pop out on the devil 's horns and he scratched his tail . Look , he said , I 'll give you a million dollars and a carload lot of women . The man considered this , and this time he shook his head mighty slow , but he shook it . The proposition , he said , comes twenty years too late . All I want is . . . Yes , I know , the devil said , enough money to run a sawmill without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trade , but I 'm sure one broke devil . " Hopgood Schott laughed and his laughter reverberated in the small room . He stopped abruptly . Pete Legrand neither laughed nor smiled . " Get it ? That 's what I mean . Cree could n't afford to be independent . But he just would n't let me take any boards away from him . I knew the firm had tried to buy the timber , offered almostp151what it was worth , but the widow sold to him . If I know widows she had him hog-tied . I was puzzled . There he was just like he 'd made this trade with this devil , see , standing up there on the stacks , looking away from himself . Then he dipped that hawk nose and those black satin eyes at me.  --  Schott , he said soft and sweet , everything , even a board , has its true value . I 'll tell you what we 'll do . Where there 's doubt , you take one board and I 'll take the next . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go into that barge close to what it 's worth . " He meant it . I began to think of all those cinders and tollgatesand my trouble and the firm wanted the lumber  --  it was well cut  --  and while I was thinking he said so soft I scarcely heard him  --  Otherwise I 'll have to ask you down from the stacks . " I do n't know until now whether he was bluffing or not . The funny thing I got to like it , to find somebody knew nearly as much about grades as me . Did he sweat me ? He had a nigger name of Jake . He would see a defect and flip the board quick . I 'd catch him  --  I thought you 's through , he 'd say . Was I to let on a nigger hand , a calico one at that , was faster than me ? Oh , they had me . No telling how many boards they put off on me . I 'll tell you one thing . That was the fastest job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This hill country is above the color line . Those covites did n't mean for niggers to be up there . But that did n't bother the Captain . Some of those billies had been in his company during the war ; he ran some kind of irregular outfit , he did n't join the Confederacy , just had his own private little war with the North . That just suited those covites fine . So they already knew him and agreed to let him use his nigger crew for the mill . I can hear him talking , how the crew had worked together and he 'd see they caused no trouble and besides he needed white men in the woods . And he let out contracts for hauling to the river . You know , the old self-interest plus flattery plus he was going to do it anyway . They knew him , but they made up their minds to run those colored men to where they came from anyway.  | " The freight car sat on the river barge . There was a long downhillshoot from the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those covites to shoot the planks and just one nigger loader inside the car to receive them , and they meant to kill him . But that nigger was Jake . They shot those planks , one on top of another , thinking to knock him in the head with one while he was busy with another . What they did n't know there 's a sleight to it . They were using main force and awkwardness , but Jake had the sleight . He scarcely touched the boards . Well , the Captain said it was a sight , when the car was nearly loaded , to see that squirrel head of Jake 's , a little scared now , dipping up and around the car door and the plank ripping down the slide until you 'd think for sure it would go right through to the river and take Jake with it . But Jake was n't handling the boards then , just the air around them . He burnt those white men out . They did n't even come for their pay . That 's how the Captain handled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a problem . " That 's how he handled all his problems . A man ai nt nothing but a man , and if he wo n't be that man , the Captain did n't have any use for him . Black or white . If he was a man , the color did n't make any difference . " Pete Legrand was leaning slightly forward in his chair . Hiseyes were set as if spending in some private ecstasy . He said impatiently , " What 's wrong with that ? " And rose abruptly to walkto the small window , where he turned his back upon the visitor . The visitor , unnoticing , unable to notice , caught in his need tospeak the complaint which was his defense , and speak it to astranger out of some need which had annihilated strangeness andconvention , so urgent a need that neither man seemed aware thestrangeness had been rubbed away , that the small room , the officeof commerce , had taken on a formal privacy beyond its function . So , scarcely hearing the question , or noticing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schott spoke into the secret , flour-screened office . . . . " Nothing . There 's nothing wrong withit . Only you 've got no right to get people believing , into thinkingIIp153that 's the way things are , that men can act out of honor in a daily way , that a man can always be a man , and then walk out and let a tree fall on you and mash people ten miles around . That 's all that 's wrong , to lie about the world and then run out on your lie . " Oh , but the lie was a mighty lie and it worked as long as it worked . It began on me right away . The next time down I came all primed to not even stop the buggy , just slow down enough for him to jump in , so he would n't fret about the two-second stop the buggy would have to make . I even brought my water jug . " And then when I pulled up he was n't anywhere in sightjust this boy  --  Papa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said like it was a new word " The trouble with me is I 've got a one-track mind . I could n't take it in he would n't be there . So I looked at the boy , waiting in the politest way , holding and petting the horse , and I saw he was n't no mill hand even if he had on work clothes . A nice kid about seventeen but a little light for the sawmilling game . He had an eye as clear as a May-washed window . " " Yes , yes , " Legrand said under his breath. "  --  You Captain Cree 's son ? He looked up  --  Yessir , I 'm Lucius . " He took me to the mill . The Captain had his hand on theshed post , watching the log they were sawing . He turned andwaved and turned right back . It was a big log and pulling downthe steam , . To keep this kind of outfit sharp the woods have towork against the mill and the mill against itself . That 's mainlythe sawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow offsteam makes the sawyer look mighty sorry . He ai nt being himself , see . Well , that saw was whining through that log and the enginechugging almost to a stop and the carriage racing back and thefirebox open and a young buck of a nigger sweating his color out , riding the shovel until the boiler began to shake . When the steamblew off , he 'd come jigging around and jerk his head at the sawyer . I never saw anything to look exactly like that sawyer . An old negroname of Peter , heavy , squat , he might have been a walnut stump ,  |p154with  a belly out in front like he 'd swallowed a melon . Had on specs somebody had given him so gummed over with dust and sweat if one of the glasses had n't been gone he never would have seen what he was doing . After a while those planks sliced like butter . The offbearers stayed bent over . My , but were the Captain 's eyes merry . He shouted to me  --  He 's got old Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning out boards like that you 'd never need to worry about banks or devils or anything else . They come to a big gum and it really pulled that steam down . Midways in the log , just to show the fireman he had him , old Peter dropped his hand and stuck that great big old belly of his against the stick and pushed it through . The Captain laid back his head and laughed . Then he took me by the arm and walked over to the buggy his boy brought up . He jumped in and said  --  I 've got to collect toll on the pike today . You go ahead and take up the lumber.  --  Hold on , I said . Who 'll inspect for you ?  --  Nobody . Just tally up what 's there.  --  But look , I said . I 'm working for this firm , not you . Who 'll take care of your interest ?  --  You , he said.  --  Me ?  --  I put you on your honor . Just mark down what the board 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your firm , too .  --  Hold on , I said.  --  Take Lucius along and show him how to tally . " And with that he was off , the horse at a fast trot , tail up and farting and Lucius standing there smiling at me.  --  I 'll get the buggy , he said . " It was n't right . Working for two men and paid by one and teaching free that boy Lucius and watching calico Jake all at the same time . I was ready for bed that night . But did I go to bed ? No . I was on the back of a mule riding up hills a spider would slip off until finally , when the moon come up , we stopped , all of us , black and white , dogs and men , and the boy Lucius . They turned the dogs loose and made a fire so quiet you would have thought itp155was against the law . They sat down around it and never spoke , listening to the night . I tried to make a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shhh . . . I could feel the ticks crawling , the woods was full of them , seed ticks , yearling ticks , old ticks . They kept me awake , that tired I was . I guess I 'd have dropped off if the jug had n't made the rounds . Lucius handed it to his papa . He smelled it and then passed it to me . I took a good man 's swig and let her burn . I 'm not a drinking man , but I knew it would let me last the night . They all took a drink like their mind was n't on it ; even the niggers had a jug . After that they talked a little , but they tolled the words out like the last coins in the family sock . Then way off below a dog opened up . Every head came up like a turkey 's . Leatherbury whispered  --  That 's old Belle . After a while somebody  --  No , that 's Queenie . They disputed about it . How could they tell which dog it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like they 'd staked their wives on the race , a poor sort of racing when you could n't even see the dogs run . They ran clear out of hearing . They had opinions as to where the dogs had gone until after a while the Captain said  --  Boys , they 've gone to the Peaks . They wo n't be back until morning . We 'll let John Henry round them , up . The rest of us might as well go back to camp . And then he turned to me and said  --  I had hoped to give you a better race , sir . I said  --  Looks pretty good to me . You ran the dogs clear out of hearing . That brought the only genuine laugh of the evening . " While the others hitched the mules , the Captain stepped over to the brow of the ridge and looked out at the night . He said , low  --  Come here , Schott . He waved his hand , taking it all in and under the moon that was a lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there . I looked and there was nothing but trees , in the coves and valleys and on the ridges . He was right , and as I stood there I had the funny feeling he was reading my mind . Then as if it hurt him to see it , he turned away and we started back to camp . " The next day was Saturday and only half a workday . I had planned to run into town , but he told me I looked a little tired and to lay over Sunday and he would show me something . I didn'tp156hold back much , it would n't have done me any good , and besides I 'd been thinking about what he 'd shown me from that ridge . Well , we set out for the woods through the timber he had bought from the widow , and it was a pretty track . He took me right to the best of it , and I saw the firm did n't know what they had let get by them . The woods were deep and he sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his head , always looking up at the trees , never where his feet were going . He 'd already told them to keep out of the way of snakes . I 'd never talked to mine . I 'd always figured feet were to walk with and let it go at that . So if I had n't been looking I 'd a stepped smack on the biggest copperhead , the granddaddy copperhead of that region . He 'd stirred it up for me on the moss side of a down log as he went over . I jumped straight up .  --  Did n't you see that snake ? I shouted .  --  Snake ? he asked , slowing a trifle . He did n't even look back .  --  Never saw a snake in the woods in my life . " Can you beat that ? I forgot the snakes myself when we stopped at the place he wanted to show me . There must have been thirty white oaks to the acre and there must have been ten or twelve acres all together and just alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun never got through to the ground here . He went from tree to tree and beat each one of them lightly with his fist .  --  Look at this , he would say in awe . Or this . " I came right out with it .  --  How 'd a man like you outbid the smartest operators in the state ?  --  They did n't know what was here.  --  They did n't know this maybe , and I took in the white oaks , but they knew what else was here . " A merry twinkle came into his eyes .  --  Maybe they were looking for moccasins when they cruised it.  --  All right , I said , but how 'd you do it ? " He looked at me as if I was a child .  --  I 've hunted every foot of this land.  --  I forgot , I said . The new way . Business , pleasure 's by-product.  --  Schott , this is too good for lumber . This is Grand Rapids stuff . Golden oak.  | " I got what he meant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fashion now . I just sat there and lookedat him , wondering what ever made me take him for a peckerwood.  --  Quarter sawed , this will pay me out and the rest profit .  --  I 've got to hand it to you , I said . " And then he made me the proposition . It was for me and that boy Lucius to go into the lumber business with him as a kind of Chairman of the Board . He could buy it right and cut it right , and I knew the markets and could sell it right . But first I was to sell this quartered oak to Grand Rapids on a commission . It would sort of whet their appetite for the big bait we could buy together . Of course this was my chance , but I wanted to get my bearings . It looked too good and he was too smart . So I said just to give me time  --  Now tell me how did you manage to outbid the firm ? They offered cash , and I 'm told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispering . Here we were with our heads leaning towards each other and he listening to himself and the air it dead and still , eavesdropping us . In that shade , under those trees with not a limb for sixty feet it gave me the feeling of being in church , not that Sunday starched feeling but the real thing . It got so quiet that when a twig popped , I jerked.  --  Schott , there is something else . He looked up and down , as if it was awful hard to get out .  --  My purchase has engaged me and Amelie Cropleigh in a contest of honor . " I just looked at him . Was this a child ? What was he ?  --  You mean the widow ? " He nodded .  --  She blames me for her weeds . He spoke so sad .  --  You killed her husband ?  --  She in a sense feels I did.  --  Let me get this straight . You killed her husband for her and she sold you the timber cheap out of gratitude . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get rich , too , if you widow all the women tired of their men . It sure will revolutionize the timber business . " He looked shocked , but I was doing the best I knew .  --  You misunderstand me , he said coldly .  --  I did n't kill him . Only greatp158sorrow could hold me to blame . Then his eyes compelled mine .  --  He was my cousin and brother-in-law . Just like that , as if that made it impossible , if relatives had n't been doing one another in ever since Adam was run out of the garden .  --  He was killed in line of duty , under my command . She blamed me . So immoderate is her passion.  --  You 'll have to excuse me , I said . What 's that got to do with her turning over to you about the finest tract of timber in the state ?  --  Greed.  --  Greed ?  --  In love and hate . I went to her and said  --  I 'll give you a chance to settle this old score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this timber at a price I can pay and I 'll agree to cut it in half the time any mill could do it . If I can do that , I 'll make enough to educate Lucius , restore the farm , and have capital to work with . If I fail , I ruin my son 's future.  --  She took you up ? " He bowed his head . That ought to warned me . But how was I to know . He bought it under the nose of the smartest operators in the business . It would have to be no uncommon trade to do that . Still I ought to known . The odds he took . Nobody could cut that much timber in the time allowed . Then it came to me.  --  That golden oak . You gambled on that.  --  I gambled on old Peter . He 's the fastest quarter sawyer in the business . " I stood up .  --  All right , I 'll do it.  --  Shake on it , he said . Schott paused and regarded the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glazed window . The back was rigid . The rigidity was like a shut door . Suddenly he felt he had not been heard and he had to be heard and understood . He raised his voice , " Do n't you see ? " He began again , changing tone to leave out the plea . He had no plea to make unless it was to be understood . " Do n't you see something always goes wrong when you do business in an unbusinesslike way . He lets this tree fall on him and my prospects . I made it up to myself as best I could . "  | " You made it up ? How ? " Peter Legrand turned suddenly . " I re-tallied that last barge at a lower grade . That gave me a nice profit . He owed me that . " " You lowered the grade ? " Legrand 's voice was clipped , his gaze level and cold . " Sure I did . " " And Joe Cree had put you on your honor ? " " That 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His heirs ca n't do a thing about it . " " But he put you on your honor ? " Schott heard himself say petulantly , " He would have wanted me to have it , after what he promised me . " Pete Legrand walked swiftly to his desk . " What 's your proposition , sir ? " " Well , I thought you could buy his rig and the equity in the timber . You can buy it cheap . The heirs will have to sell . We could carry out his idea . You 're a rich man , Mr. Legrand . You can handle it . It would make a nice profit for years . " Pete Legrand allowed for the smallest pause ; the silence from the mill hummed in the office . He said , " You are a fool and a knave . Good day , sir . " Schott hung there , neither sitting nor standing , hung to his amazement rising from the chair , as if he were hooked , his head thrown up and back against the pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger but disbelief , that money could ever refuse to make money . This he could not but must now accept and the acceptance blanched through his weathered skin as he jerked upright , lost now , knowing it but not yet accepting it , for he had come to the flour mill , not so much to make a trade , hoping maybe , but knowing only Joe Cree could make it work , as to be restored to the belief that the means did not matter , the end was all . . . . " Well , I must say , Mr. Legrand . . . " He tried to show anger , but the anger rang hollow . " Good day , sir , " Pete Legrand said and looked away . He dipped a pen in ink and leaned over the heavy bound ledgerand waitedp160until he heard the lumber inspector bump against the door on his way out . He heard him try to slam it but the floor sagging caught it , the poor fool could n't even do that to restore his selfesteem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end ever can be more or less than the sum of what has gone to make it , or that a man can be more or less than what he is . He heard the man 's steps ring loud in the hollow mill and then cease . Now he could look up . But he was not yet alone . The man was on the loading platform , his head bowed and the constant blaze of the sun was all about him . At last he walked away , head still down , as if he were breaking water . What was his name , Schott , born to be the counter in other men 's moves . How he knew these counters . Now . Now. he must say it before the body shudder would loose the chill and shaking . Julia , he whispered . All other names names , her name a caress . A tree and a knave had made her his at last . This was better than he had hoped . All he had ever hoped was that she would be free before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through war , running contraband cotton at a dollar a pound , through one trade after another when he could n't lose , to blot out time while she slept in Joe Cree 's arms . A cold twinge lashed the old scar across his belly and he leaned forward to ease it . No longer need it burn to remind him . Cautiously he drew himself upright and stood in the presence of himself . He wore the best broadcloth now , but the clothes he had had on that morning , twenty years ago , as he rode into her yard would fit him still , by the well-kept fence , raised two rails higher than most , all around the pasture to the side of her house , with a branch running down the middle and filled with wild mule colts . The mare he rode quickened her step , nodding fast , and the colts ran down to the fence with their light stiff pace and his mare threw up her head and whinnied . He held her in as the colts trotted along the fence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for no reason , like colts , they swirled and broke , kicking , their heads swung awkwardlydown darkening the pasture like a shadow with tatteredp161edges , and then over the branch they dropped their muzzles to lip the lush summer grass . All except six . He had thought there was no reason , but if it was not the reason at least the trigger to spring the trap for him . But trap was not the word though . The two riders had cut these six colts out and were driving them towards the lot back of the house . The riders were young , that was his first impression ; his next that they would remain perpetually young . He remembered this now , for it had seemed strange that he would be so impressed . One of them slight , supple as a switch , hair bouncing beneath a soft crushed hat , and shouting at the other in a high clear voice . Brothers , he had thought . Very trim . And then he saw they were dressed both in buckskin . He kicked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , the bridge fallen in and yet the fences were kept , the pastures good , and the house although it lacked paint sat square and solid among the cedars . He turned aside , splashed through the creek , up the slope , towards the teaming barn lot . The older rider looked back and called to him to shut the gate . That shout , Close the gate , shut out all that up to that moment he had been and shut him in with them and his Fate . That morning he had left the county seat , directed to this farm , the Cropleigh holding , where he was told he could be guided to the land he had inherited . These were the commonplace facts , but is a fact ever commonplace ? There should be some clear sign for the fateful moment ; some pause to interpret that call ; but the edge of the whirlpool seems ever to offer comfort and reprieve from the usual violence . He did not even think it odd that he should be spoken to as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger rider circling kept them moving towards and around the open barn doors . The older brother served for pivot , holding ground gained , moving forward , giving only to regain , until one of the colts broke into the dark maw of the barn hall . The rest followed , fleeing into the trap . He noticed their coats , slick and shining , dulled the instant they reached the threshold . And then the doorsp162banged to . From inside came sounds of bodies striking walls , and once the heavy doors shuddered from a blow . After this the commotion stilled . In the silence he heard the clear sweet voice which would forever be his song , " Bubba , that did it . " Duncan was leaning against the doors , his horse close by , while his own heart shivered , he had thought from the skilldisplayed , oh but the heart has ears and eyes of its own . " I 'll holdthe tar bucket , " the voice again , the words thrown away in the act of dismounting . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ca n't go in . " Suddenly he felt alone in the barn lot . The other , imperiously petulant , " I will . " " Now , sis , do I have to go to the trouble of tying you up ? " He had known all along that it was she . " I will learn , " she said , " to alter those hoss colts . " A girl dressed like a boy , plainly a girl now , scarcely coming to her brother 's shoulder ; yet there was in her body all the concentration of a hummingbird , or wasp , poised before its object . Then her fists were flailing her brother 's chest , and the brother waiting until she tired . She stopped all at once . Her brother said , " This stranger will hold the tar bucket . " Those words seemed to make them , aware of him and they turned together , their movements seemed always together . They looked at him curiously , and he back at her . He could see her eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed as a shadow passes , and she took him in carefully , with the open unabashed stare of a child . She was scarcely more than a child , he saw , thirteen or fourteen . But even so the boyish clothes could not disguise the small swell of her breasts . His gaze must have lingered there , in puzzlement only , for when he sought her eyes again they had darkened . She was striding towards him and he dismounted to meet her . She barely paused , whispering as she passed , " He 's quick at it . Sometimes he ca n't resist . But runs the knife all the way in. "  |p163Then  she was gone and the tawny eyes of the other were on him . The distance between them was not great , certainly not enough to disguise the indifferent brute stare which fixed him . He could not turn to follow the disappearing girl . He returned stare for stare , but he reached no further than the dry glazed orbs which told him nothing . They reflected nothing ; they expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of a creature who saw best at night . The voice was slow and casual . " Hitch your horse . When I call , unbutton the door and come inside . " The call was peremptory but muffled . He slipped into the barn , and the dry dust of the manure almost choked him . Through the door cracks shafts of light impaled the gloomy air . The dust motes whirled furiously . Breathing carefully , he went up to Duncan , who was leaning against the rump of a colt , his hand pointing to the tar bucket . " Quick , " he said . The colts were all in one large stall , packed so tightly they could not move . Their heads reaching up stretched in frozen twisting curves ; a tail raised and he heard the bowel empty itself of its terror . Then the knife was out . For an instant it sliced the swirling , glittering shaft of light ; and then the brother turned . Stooping slightly , the left hand went between the trembling legs . Deftly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . He followed with bowl and daub , as in some reversal of ritual the hand went in and down , then across , and the useless gold dropped underfoot . Christ ! Why did it . . . why did he see that knife ? His scar tightened its lace of pain . Bent down in spite of himself , he waited ; then carefully he drew his body upright . He could feel the circlet of sweat upon his brow . " That scar of yours , Big Pete . It 's some weather prophet . The drought will break . " He looked up . There was Saul Slowns standing in the office door . " Yes , " he said . And then , " Yes . "  |p164But  the heart 's drought . It dries the green dust even of spring . But no season lasts . There is no weather but turns to the harvest , if you can wait . . . if only . . . and I have waited for my love . Mine now . And no man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name behind the lips , the parched lips . Clamped by the teeth down the slow years , the whisper whispering in the tiny veins . No more could he allow himself . He could not say , It is a mistake , her place at another man 's board and bed . Called by his name . It was I , Pete Legrand , who made her a woman , who gave her a son , a son who does not know his father . But if the father knows and can not make known his knowing . Banished . That 's what he 'd been . Exiled at home . The homing stranger . The near so far , the far too close . But now the long dry season is over . Now he would claim his own . " The buggy 's ready , " Slowns said . He looked at Slowns , reminding him of the business he had to do . How dull it seemed . But he must keep his grip . If he hurried he could get it over and back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . So he would act , and so it would seem . Life the sly deceiver . . . He felt a twinge of nostalgia . The patient rabbit eyes of Slowns , those eyes that were always too open , saw too much . But Slowns knew how to keep his mouth closed . The old life , the life in which he had so depended upon Slowns , was dead . The new life would leave little in it for Slowns . He said , " Did you find anything to toll the carriage horses ? " " Nothing but plow lines . " " Will they be stout enough ? " " Unless something scares the horses . " " That 's not likely . " " You never know , " Slowns said carefully , in his clipped Yankee speech , " on a pike . " " I 'll close this ledger and we 'll go , " Legrand said . As he followed Slowns from the mill into the buggy , he looked up and saw that the sky was the sky once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they jogged along the slow miles , it kept the old familiar look , hovering the ground , fleeced withp165clouds , and a great cumulus heaped up before the sun like weighedupcotton . For a mile now the fields on both sides of the pike would be cotton fields . The wagons stood scattered here and there for the harvest . Their slim tongues propped up to hold the scales were poised like antennae above the crop ; the scales tied by a trace chain hung from the tongue 's ring , balancing the air ... and the wagons like insects gorged to death on the harvest . Here and there a whole field was stripped of its white bolls , and through the stiff brown stalks the gashed red ground showed how spent it was . But most of the fields lay both brown-stalked and white as the pickers , their sacks dragging in the brown , their hands licking the tufted bolls , crawled toward the fence rows . Before his eyes the dragging sacks were bellying to hatch in the fields they ate . But the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaten the crop and , for many of the pickers , they 'd eaten the seed not yet in the ground . Some were eating the ground . Dirt daubers . That 's what they were . " Dirt daubers , " he said aloud , " eating the ground . " " They 'll soon suck mud , " Saul Slowns remarked , and cut his eye at the sky . " There 's a heap of weather up there . " The two horses they were tolling seemed to be swimming in the dust they kicked up , but the sky would soon settle the dust , all of it . Yes , it was coming , the rain , and it would be a gulley-washer . The downpour was slowly gathering in the northwest . Everywhere the sky was closing down . Everywhere it touched the hot dry ground , and the ground helpless , exposed , forever received withoutchoice what the sky let down . It would always be so . The long scorching was over , but the threat remained . It curled with the leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pike . The cotton pickers seemed to crawl through it secretly , as if for breath . A man 's a fool to work so , to depend upon the seasons . Look at that one now , looking doubtfully at the sky , not knowing whether to be thankful for the shade and the promise of rain or apprehensive , kneeling before almighty power , back humped , arms stiff upon his thighs . Like some effigy depicting resignation . The man 's gazep166even was stony . Was the gaze coming to rest upon him ? He leaned over the side of the buggy to make sure , and turned back quickly . It looked like a man who owed him money . He had no time to be hailed today .. . HimIt 's him . Away he goesIt do n't make thatPete Legrand no diffuncehit 's a-fixing up to rain . Windand water can beat out the cotton , he'llstill gin it . He 'll take his toll , goodgrade or bad . He do n't pay none . Whur 's he a-tolling them bayss'fat and pretty ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned too sharp . His scar , it caught him . Sometimes he could forget it , sometimes , but it was always there , a gapped scythe stitched to his belly . Damp weather always ached it , a throb at a stitch . Carefully Pete Legrand drew himself upright and caught beneath the buggy seat and pulled . It was like stone ache . The only way was to pull . That did it , but in a rainy spell he had to take the hurtingyou 're hurting meshe was a switch swaying , 0 Julia , before whom the trees parted , supple in the saddle , erect but pliant and when they came out into Parcher 's Cove and hung the deer , it was as if they had gone back in time , the world simple as the first day , the cedar grove holding the heat from the fire as a room mightBubba 's suit is too tight . It 's rubbing me . I 've some rawhide . I 'll make laces . On the log he cut the strips straight and thin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked across at her , his companion . Sitting back on her heels , head curved swan-necked , she seemed to have forgotten his presence . Her hands deftly clasped the bone-handled blade . She punched-cut holes in the garment . It sprawled between her thighs like a shadow . She had undressed before him with no more shame than a boy at a swimming hole . He had paid no more attention than if he , too , had been such a boy but had gone about gathering wood and the last bough he picked up seemed as the first , as if he had made but one motion , as if he had never begun and so could never end . And the fire leaping lightened the dark , the cedar boughs crackling , the rich oil exuding , wavering in the draught like ribbons aflame and the draught curling in its upwards plunge out of the hot center turned the grove upon the axis of a scent , aromatic , rinsing the air damp and thick , layered of earthmold , leaf mold . The odor of cedar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could feel his muscles , limp and heavy from the chase , quicken . In this seasonless grove of cedar he had arisen , light as a butterfly , fluttering the evergreen reflection into which the flames rolled . The air pitched with the color and motion of the sea . Its chaste scent was as astringent as sea water . The laces entwined in his fingers , falling , undulated like seaweed . He crossed over as indifferentas a fish , paused in wonderment when his body , coming betweenher and the firelight , dissolved into its shadow , and the shadow merged with her nakedness . Instantaneously shadow and flesh together shrank towards the ground . Only her hair , aureate , glistened as it floated into the firelight 's surging . Each writhing golden strand fractured his marble eyes . At that instant she looked up . Their smile met in the space between . And then the bearskin glided from off her shoulders . She was entirely exposed : he saw only how pitifully frail her shoulders were . Quickly he seized the skin to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her and , startled , she leaped up , shivering , poised like a doe upon flight . Drenched by the warm light , her body glowed and in this glow her skin shifted its shape . His kneeling eyes began the old ritual afresh , as his knees pressing into the pliant earth released itsp168fecund odor to crawl thick and languid up his thighs , to stifle his breath . The thump of his heart beat his ears like a drum . His lips swayed into the soft-giving flesh to shudder with the shuddering of her being . His senses drowned in the fragrance of the rose . It was not until she began to struggle that he was aware his hands clasped her and that they would not for a time release hera plunging jerk . . . the buggy whip snapped and quivered its length into the socket . . . " Goodness , " he said , " what a washout . " " Drought or flood , they damage the same , " Saul said . " Strange . Joe Cree said that , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he do n't , " Saul said , " if they are good enough . " Joe Cree . The name fell between them like a spell , and the black gums blazed in the countryside . The buggy rolled upon its wheels straight upon the hard muted and fluid surface of the pike , the narrow margin of safety , defined by the snaked fence rails .. . " Timber cutting is sure some widow maker , " Saul said . Widow . Julia a widow . But wait . They would expect her to wear her weeds for a year . Would there be no end to this waiting ? He had thought of six months as a decent time , and six months it would be . No matter the talk . If they talked too much , some would find the cost of speech high . Julia , Julia ! Miss Jule Cree , that 's real trouble . I always say there 's something to be thankful for . They say that tree broke ever bone in his body , and when they picked him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crop and the pond dry and the well mud , until looks like we ca n't get this little crop picked for hauling water but she 's got a short crop and dry wells and her man dead in the house . Say as you will she 's got hands to do for her , it 's not the same . I 've got Mister Dunnaway to do for me , when I heard of her trouble I said to Mister Dunnaway , I 've got you Mister Dunnaway and no hand will do for you like your man can , wonder what makes him so long coming with that water . He 's been gone since before lightSis Laura , ai nt that dust a-rising on the pike ? I declare I bep169glad to wet my mouth . Out of snuff . Out of water . A body 's teeth do git dry . That 's no water wagon , sister . Dust a-rising too fast . I take it to be a drummer . Who but a drummer could spare himself to trot the pike in gathering time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't take no record of time a-passing . And he ai nt as peart as once and his water 's backed up on him I named it to him to go to Doctor Cropleigh , I said to him I ca n't wash it out of your long underwear , it 's going to rot it for sure and this dry time and water scarce as it is and the time and all for hauling but you know what that man said to me ? He said , I can turn a pebble over three foot in front of me . I just told him , what you can do and ca n't do , Mister Dunnaway , is no news to meChildren . That 's all they are . Ever last one of them ought to be stood in a barrel of lye . Yes . Yes now . Ever old woman ought to be shuck out , at day dawn . You hush , Josiah . Go weigh up that cotton . Lawd , that 's no drummer , sister . That 's Mister Legrand . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no woman to do for him . Nobody to leave it to . It equals out someways , now do n't it ? Who 's that in the other seat ? That 's that Yankee fellow you know Saul Slowns he calls himself . Stopped by on his way home after the war . A right clever fellow . Wonder why he do n't go home . Reckon he 's got no folks ? I ai nt heared . Some say he was shot , you know , there . I guess he were shamed to go home . You reckon ?  |p170I  've no way of knowing . You ca n't tell . You know how folks talk . They 'll rumor anything . Wo n't they now . Yes , that 's him . That 's that Saul Slowns . " First I saw this land , Big Pete , the spring equinox had come and gone . But the land did n't know it , all a-quiver in winter 's mud and a thin crust of ice to trap the foot . It seemed to me a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my calf in a mud binding as glue , colder than cold , ice splinters spewing out of the ground like a rotten frost . You can stand ice when it 's clean and bright . It looks pure anyway . The frozen promise . But this ice was dirty and over the muddy puddles in those ditches thousands of boots had missed or avoided , it was sheeted as thin as hope and the color of pus . That was sixty-two . I was a young recruit hell bent to save the Union . " " Well , you saved it . " " And you , Big Pete . Maybe you saved it , too , and got paid to boot . Whereas I . . . " He let Saul 's voice fall away . The strain of the drought , was it telling even on him , for surely he was not given overmuch to confession . Was there some small part of envy in him , whose devotion he had never tried to measure but had taken for what it seemed ? He had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd made money out of death . Plant blood and you sell death short . He himself had had little part in this . It had happened he was in a position to seize cotton , with a Federal escort for the wagons . What if he got a dollar a pound for it ? He did n't make the price any more than he 'd made the war . And he took some risk . So long ago now it seemed , and of so little moment he 'd forgotten what a stake it was . And for sure he was no man to bury his talents . Yet it had not mattered whether he won or lost on that throw . It was no legal tender for his wants . It would not buy vengeance , for Duncan Cropleigh had been killed , and not by his hand . When news of that death reached him , he had quickly transferred to the Quartermaster'sCorps . To Duncan , then , he owed his fortune . He heardp171himself half grunt , half laugh . " Saul , before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man deals in . " Saul looked at him now directly . He met Saul 's gaze ; looked away as the veil of privacy ripped . " So . . . " Saul said . Pete answered hastily , " I was a Whig . I fought for the Union cause . There 's a difference . " " But did it win ? " " If you mean did I win . No . " " But you hoped . That your presence , your presence itself on the other side might cause all who stood in your way to perish , and then she ... " " Hush , " Pete said . " How can you know , a stranger to this country , its enemy who dropped by and I took you in out of charity , or some common need of solace , when all here turned their backs  --  all but Joe Cree . " " Aye . Joe Cree . " " Aye . He treated me as a man of honest conviction . He saw proof in my risk of life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You say I got paid to boot ? What coin had I to match that ? A man who can be whipped , lose all his goods or have them ruined , and when it 's over treat me , the enemy as a man , who , like himself was only fortune 's toy , but the toy to come out on top . Top or bottom , it made little difference if you were a man . That was Joe Cree . He shamed me into honor , for I was a partisan like the rest . Yet there was that between us which was my secret and not his , which burned my tongue as it taught me honor has its folly too . So in the end I minted a coin to tell a higher carat than his . It rings on the barrel head , pure , the alloy stamped into my guts . It will purchase , Saul . It will buy . I do n't know why I tell you this , and yet I know well enough . We are banished men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The horse slowed for Penter 's Hill , as if out of care , as if the ruts and holes would spill their brimming thoughts . From the thick woods crowding the narrow bending way up , the air drank the reek of animal sweat and the rancid harness . They rolled through it upp172to their eyes , as through an underwater ford until at last the horse lurched onto the brow of the hill and stopped to blow in the clean rare air . " But I am reprieved , " Pete Legrand said . And Saul , " It 's the alloy makes it ring . What till passes twentyfourcarat ? " " Time . And do I know it , that till . Has my coin not rung there , and each time with a lighter tone , as I waited ? Not to spend but being spent all the same , that 's the cost of waiting . Each day you seem diminished , but it 's the dross that is spun away . Who but me knows this so well ? But there were moments when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its hoard seems common dust . So accustomedare we to be firmed by dross . I have bought empty days and years . I know their cost . But the account is settled now . What a lift to the feeling when the ledger is balanced and you have paid for what you have bought . There are not many . Look about at these fields . One season 's drought . Who could wait it out ? Well , mighty few . Each morning they look to the sky for relief , and each evening note how the corn has fired a little more . Or how the cotton droops . I 've watched the strain on patience tighten , for stress does not add . It multiplies . And then it comes , the break , the snap of the will like a popping thread . Not idleness , emptiness is the devil 's shop . Each man fills it after his fashion , but fill it he must . Some take to drink , some to whoring . Some leave the country . And the saddest folly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strength of failure . That 's a ghostly money , but debt is no ghost . These bays we are tolling . A month ago they belonged to Squire Drumgoole . A sensible enough man . But what does he do ? He buys a barouche he does n't need and ca n't afford and sells the very team he means to draw it with as part payment on the deal . There 's a clause , he 's not that lunatic , that he can buy them back plus feed and care when he sells his hogs . And the pigs are there . He could count them . But what he could n't count on was the cholera , and yet he was counting it all along . " So you get a three-hundred-dollar team for half its value and a buggy at cost . "  | " Barouche . I held old man Salter 's note . It was a good way to take it up . But that 's just an example . " " It may be an example to you , Big Pete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have to ride into his yard with his own team and take his own buggy out of his buggy house , with his wife peeping behind the blinds , and him maybe to help hitch up ... " " Barouche . " " Barouche , then . " Kill one fly . Ten come to the funeral . It 's the change in the weather . A sure sign of rain . Well , I be glad to see it . Adolphus , bring that brush and shoo the flies off this mixing bowl . Bake this cake I will . It 's the least I can do for her . There 's little enough you can do for Julia Cree , but I always say neighbors ought to be neighborly . Let 's see , here 's the flour , I guess there 's enough sugar on that loaf I need two more eggs . Now Adolphus while I go to the hen house you lift the butter out of the well and if you spill that butter I 'll skin you alive . It 's the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving milk falling off every day I do n't know what we 're going to do and Mister Bascom such a hearty eater and the children and all and not a cook in the kitchen . You just ca n't keep them in cottonpickingtime , and you ca n't blame them they make more money . What 's that ? The old sow 's out again , mama . Get the hoe , get the axe , you Adolphus , catch that well rope , mercy , thank God you did n't drop it , that butter down the well and where would my cake be ? Listen , run she 's caught a hen , sweet loving Jesus , enough 's enough . A woman can stand only so much . I told him to fix that pen , I told him you ca n't patch it up and hold her , that 's all he ever knows to do . Patch up . I 'll fixit the first rainy day , I 'll fixit after first Monday , I 'll fixit after the crop 's laid by . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for the barn !  |p174Watch  out , mama . You near missed me with that stick of stove wood . Eating my bulbs , rooting up my yard , scratching her old self on the front steps , if we could only sell her lice , we 'd be rich enough  --  all right , just turn her on the commons . And bar the gate . That 'll fix her . That 'll fix it once for all . You hear me , Adolphus ? I do n't care what your pappy says . And then you come lift that butter out of the well . Bake that cake I will , if it 's the last thing I do . It 's little enough in her time of sorrow , with all those people coming to the funeral . And she to feed them . You 'd think when they die , they 'd leave you in peace . At least when they die you can let up on the cooking . Just look at these eggs . Mashed . Nests ruined . No eggs . Here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll just have to skimp it . Maybe the icing will patch it up . I 'll make it extra thick . I wish to God I had never seen Mister Bascom ! There was no sound at all upon the top of Penter 's Hill ; but there was a coolness , you could n't call it a breeze , slipping so light from the woods not a leaf rustled . He 'd let the horse blow a while , he 'd never seen her so spent , the dust caked like axle grease over her back , and so still , her tail slapping from side to side as if out of its own motion , as if all motion had now drawn into the tail . Pete sighed and overlooked the knobs and hillocks dropping before him . He always liked the view from here , with the road winding through the ridges , and the valleys sloping away into their privacy and with the look , at least , of peace . And then it happened as it always happened , but what a difference today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an eye , in the toy house pasted upon distance . And yet through the gap it was there , that room in the second story of the ell . She slept there in a real house , upon real foundations , in that one certain spot . But here , upon the slope of the hill , at this distance , he made it a toy in his mind , and at his will he could and had moved all within to suit his fancy . But once down the grade he would lose it and not see it again until after the bend/ing and the rise and fall of the pike , when suddenly he would come down upon it actually , a house with a dwelling 's proper proportions . He never looked then . He drove by , with his gaze upon the pike and feeling the reins in his hands moving with the ease of a slow piston . But that was behind him now . Soon he would be able to turn in at the gate , look steadily at what was his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Son , take the buggy around and unhitch . " " The land down there looks skinned , do n't it ? " Saul said . " And yet we 're not so high as all that , to see it so . " He did not answer at once , and then he said , " I keep to the pike . And they come to me by the pike . That 's the way to do business for a profit . Never talk to a man in the fields or in his house about business . It 's always a coming up to judgment with me . If I considered a man 's needs from his need , I 'd end up bankrupt . Nor would he thank me for it . " " But going up and down the pike . Ai nt it kind a lonesome ? " " I go . I do my business . I return . You have to choose . " NemmindWhat your mammy sayKick your little footsand fly awayListen at him . I reckon he thinks them mules will fly him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turkey buzzard . The wagon might fly . It 's light enough . Go ahead . Show everbodyfrom here to Texas what little gear you got . Let them take note the way a body can ride along , with no more care than to bind his spokes with baling wire . And that guitar laying on the feather bed as proud as evil doing . If they are a mind to ask whur your woman is , tell them how she 's picking the crop you left in the fields , to give the man his sheer for rent and fertilize . When it 's asked whur you 've cropped before , tell about the time you let the grass take it and folks raised a flag in the field , and you with no more git-up than to set on the porch and not take it down . And if they are of a mind to ask how come you left home ,  |p176s|peak  out . Tell how contrary the weather is at home , and you after that Texas weather will plant a crop , chop and pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going . You a-coming ? No . I ai nt a-coming . I 've lived on every farm in this country and now we 've a roof do n't leak and a house sets fair out of the wind , I 'll stay and be dry for a spell . They got women in Texas . Git up , mule . You , Asa . You self-appointed son of a bitch . You wait . You wait til I dig up my rambler rose . You sold my cow , but I 'll take my rambler it 's the last thing I do . Make haste then . You already thowed me late . The horse bracing its steps , the shafts lifted against the harness as the buggy rolled slowly downgrade , winding through the cedar brake towards the cut where the wild-grape vines , looping , made a green tunnel . Pete and Saul unmoving moved with the turning wheels towards its shaggy mouth , agape upon the rotting limestone , chipped like Indian discs , jagging their edges into the tunnel 's throat . There light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay in this tunnel like a floor . Over it the voice walked high and clear .. . 1 gave my love a ring that has no end " Answer a riddle and it asks another , " Saul said . " The woman is singing a love song , " he replied . They both looked towards the cabin from which the voice was coming . It could not be seen for the trees . Saul said , " Travel as he will , a man is always circling about his predicament . " " A man must stand up , Slowns . Sight with the eye . That brings him the shortest way through . In love or anything else . " " Stand him straight as a pine , Big Pete , a man still bends to the horizon . Lose him in the mass of an army , he makes an arc of his feet . And though an army goes forward and back , on that one-two beat it pounds out a rhythm that will finally walk into his head , and even the longest march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has beat it , his mind fills up , for emptiness I believe you said is what a man ca n't stand . And when it 's all over , he rings up where he began . Or if it 's not over , but he 's in an outfit occupying the enemy town , there 's a man for you looking two ways at once , with eyes running in opposite directions to meet bang up in a blindness that 's called the world 's travel , for no matter how big the town or the occupying force it all comes down to one house and one man . " " Then let him move in . It 's a shelter he knows . " Saul said quickly , " The soldier boy 's not dressed right . " The horse pricked its ears as they broached the vine-covered way . Draped at the entrance , the heat 's shadow shimmered like a ghost leaving water . Their eyes plunged through to reach the depths within . The buggy rolled into the tunnel . Pete took a deep breath and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who would think a shadow had a taste ? Below , when they came out , it would be only half a mile and the road would pass her house . This time he would turn ; he would look . His heart began it , the slow steady ringing . I 'm running fast as a bird almost , but birds do n't need shoes . I can make it . Pappy 'll forgit it . I will name it again . He 'll have to unbutton the gate . Or he 'll disremember those with the red toes and buttons plumb to the top . I 'll walk into meeting and the buttons will shine like white berries , and everybody will look , but I will not look . I will set my foot forward for the washing and the shoe toe so red and his hand will trimble oh the dust is hot among my toes , but I 'll make it , pappy 's just pulling up at the gate , he 'll wrop the lines before he swings down , pappy is ever careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will have to let by . A whole bale I picked he 'll keep to his promise , oh then and then he 'll think it 's pearls I 've got in my hands , so slick his hands will slip , oh it will make him long at the unbuttoning that buggy 's pulling up . It is hailing pappy but I better not slack up . . . oh , oh , it 's Mister Legrand . " You 're headed the wrong way , Pennyweather , " Pete Legrand said.  | " Yes , sir , Mister Legrand . I thought I 'd take this bale to the town gin . The women needing shoes and we 're out of coffee . " He examined the sky slowly , stubbornly . " It 's a-fixing up to rain . " The man , in angry shame now looked directly at him . " The town gin is closeter than yourn . " " Who gave you the money to make your crop ? Me or Semmes ? " He waited while Pennyweather swallowed and looked around at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The town gin 's a heap closeter . " " It was just as close when you borrowed the money . " " We needing a few things . " " I need that bale you owe me . " " I aim to pay ye . There 's more'n a bale in the field . " " It 's not picked . And look at that cloud . " He did not look up , nor at Pete Legrand , but between the off mule 's ears . " I aim to pay . " " You will pay today . You take that bale to my gin . I 'll inform Semmes , if he buys it , he 'll be liable . And remember this , Pennyweather . The hand that gives is above the hand that receives . " He turned back to the pike . There was the silence . He said , " Go on , madam . " The horse moved off slowly and he flicked it with the whip . The buggy jerked and then the pace grew even . Beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry to town and get this business done . Time , he would waste no more of it . " Big Pete , " Slowns said . " Yes , yes . " " Where does the hand of love lie ? " " What are you talking about ? " " You just gave to that poor bastard back there a lecture on hands . I guess because you did n't want to get on the subject of shoes , that half-grown barefooted girl might not have listened so well . " " I spoke of a just debt , " he said stiffly . " But hands . Where does a loving hand lie ? " " Where I put it , " he said abruptly . Where the coffin , Miss Jule ? and she said , her voice between lips and teeth , autonomous there , not her voice nor her breath , the gears now to lungs heart and mind all unhinged by that body on their bed  --  You know , on the ell porch , near the kitchen doorShe saidand could feel the solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he had brought twilight into the already shady chamber , close up against the bed , where the white sheet rising at the middle held the shadows at bay . . . could only feel the black sawyer ; she had no need to look : the threat lay now outside . Slices of sun quivered between the green slats ; made a ladder of the blinds , and the heat climbed with the sound of bees swarming . She walked over and pulled to the blinds a little tighter , but she saw it was no use . At the cracks along the clumsy shutters she could smell the sun seeping into the chamber , probing . . . it smelt of bee bread in a rifled hive . Nome , he said . Taint there . Not on the ell porch ? Nome . She thought , coming back towards the bed : Do I have to manage everything ? Keep everything in my head from the four seasons to a coupling pin . . . Ca n't I take time even to grieve , or worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misplace a coffin . Nome . It 's not a snuffbox . Yes 'm , he said.  |p182Yes  , ma 'm . I 'm going to cut me that big cherry down by the branch and make my coffin , husband said when husband was new . And she could see in his eyes the question in hers , looking up from the baby smacking at her breast . Oh , I 'm not studying any present need for it , he said . I do n't mean to break a filly for another to ride . And their eyes danced together , hers brighter for the hot flush of the cheeks , the confusion which made her drop them to the nursing baby . Filly ? she said . He threw his head back in that way only of his , the laughter rolling out and filling the room as he came over ; stood beside them a moment and tenderly put his hand on Lucius 's bald head . Careful , she said . Quietly he spoke , I like things done in a seemly way . I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to surprise you , have you rush about and knock down the chicken house to find planks to bury me . And she had said , Husband , hush , the still bright word robbed suddenly of its shine . He stood for a while watching the baby suck ; and then out of a brown study , quizzically smiling , he reached over and with his finger flipped the nipple out of its mouth . Its little feelings hurt , its little red face , its lusty bawling . A n't you ashamed , she said , picking on my child , and gave the child again the breast and its darling little sweet mouth nuzzled and guzzled , the little fingers sunk in her roundness . Shamefaced , he grinned and said , That little snapping turtle thinks life is all teaty . You get out of here , she said . Go make your coffin and let Lucius alone . Lucius , my child . Why do n't he come ? Her heart lunging  --  " Are you sure he 's being fetched ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . He taken mules to ride them down . " " But suppose he ca n't find them ? " And she felt the fright of what could happen , Lucius beyond her care , this fright of distance and her helplessness before it , this distance towards which all things sped . Only under her eye were things safe.  | " Julie , child . Do n't you fret . " " I ca n't help it , Aunt Nanny . " She turned to the old voice quavering , like cloth ripping unevenly . Her eyes sought her aunt 's eyes , skipping , bumping the bed , to the headboard where the old woman sat . " He 's so far from home , " she said . " Sol Leatherbury , " the old voice went on , " ca n't find his way from the kitchen door to slop the hogs . Put him in the woods now and a hant could not hide from him . " The voice jerked like a rusty gear , came to a wheezy stop . She waited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ancient kinswomanleaned towards the bed , her turkey wing fanning the quiet , and as she fanned , the quiet thickened over the bloating linen . Behind her she could feel Uncle Peter still blocking the threshold . Must they ever be about , these decrepit harbingers who had that morning brought the body homea few hours ago but now a lifetime awayShe had only stepped upon the verandah to see if the pickers had started across the road , early because there was no dew , the sky hanging above its oppressive weight of inevitability , as a change in weather , and there they were in the driveway , the old ones , threading the cedars , the spring wagon rolling with the dry crunch of the wheels , the blooded horse all in a lather , straining against the lines , prancing slightly . Its eyes wide and its nostrils flaring as if it knew . With what distinctness she saw this ! Uncle Peter crowding the high narrow seat but leaning formally away from the slight figure so strangely familiar . What brings her so early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her lap ? What is her haste that she still holds the shears with which she clipped them ? And then under the bonnet she knew her , her ancient kinswoman ; knew what lay behind as if flung into the wagon bed , the riddle now usurping the marriage bedlying neither on her side nor his but exactly in the middle . That was the usurpation . She must get them out so she could think . She turned , " Uncle Peter , would you like . ? " The aging black man stepped noiselessly into the room . He camep184to a stop just short of the bed . He stood back as if he feared to soil it , looking down the air . Then it seemed to her it was his stare which so misplaced the figure under the sheet ; gave to its features that iron disdain . And then she smelt him . Stepping back , she stepped into Aunt Nanny 's gaze neither apprehensive nor with sympathy , not even in speculation , merely blank , no , no , the odor bred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many hams you wants to soak , Mistiss ? " The cook 's voice turned her about . She righted herself , " Oh , Della , " she said and began to walk towards her , scattering her words , " Uncle Peter , will you step out to the smokehouse with me ? " She could feel him tiptoeing and then she heard it , the iron ties crunching the gravel of the drive , as if suddenly the sound had settled out of the air to roll into the earth 's brake  --  and then the silence . She quickened her steps ; her eyes leaped before her ; the voice , rapid with relief , seemed far behind , " Lucius is home . " They left old Nanny who stepped down and married Mister Tilford with the body . You step down , now , and you see better . Now I can take my farewell look . A body do n't keep and the sun strong out of season . A man was ever a morning 's favor , always a-wanting in , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battering billy and crawl back like a worm . Oh , they can be full of promise in their prime . Each time you think he 'll stay this time , but it ai nt no time . And when they big you , you say he 'll tarry with the man child you tote . For sure now , your belly tight as a drum and the child wallowing as natural as a fish in a pond . And when it kicks and thumps agen your heart it 's for all the world like it knowed its home and aimed to stay . But it wants out , and out it goes . Its daddy 's done showed the way , nigh busting you open , killing you maybe .. . But you 'll stay this time , Joe Cree , do they find that cherry box . You 'll stay put , they find it or not . Now you will , with that steady look all tangled in branches and falling leaves . The ycl/low leaf . It more suits for me than you . The last look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a riddle , to fall so light and bright and lie so heavy . The last look . Not what you 've loved but what all comes to . It wears better than love . But it 's a long look to look and not see . These silver dollars will give you ease . Your Cousin Nanny taken thought to bring the corpse money . Aye , what a wail . Double love . Double trouble . Lucius come in . Waily , waily . It gives ease too . Waily , Julie . It brings ease . That wail . . . Jack could not get it out of his head . It swelled as in some seashell under water , deep down . It moved deep within him , as some tide in the sea 's bottom , unseen , uncharted , yet always there below . It made him hesitate on his way to Julia . He paused in the passageway between her chamber and the little dressing room where she spent so much of her time . Yes , he had penetrated all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress of that cry would show in her features : and he would have to name what he saw there . He straightened himself ; he took a few steps and stopped like an eavesdropper . The door was ajar and he saw Julia framed for his sight , seated in all the clutter of her domesticity . Stilled yet alert , he seemed to himself eyes and ears hung to a shadow . But the true shadow was behind him , returned to that body on the bed , sucked into its stillness , never more to be cast before or behind , invisible but there with Joe Cree 's husk , in the house Joe Cree had built for his bride but had never finished . Fraternal war had stopped the work . It had never been resumed . He took this in now with such clarity : the upstairs a shell , the great rooms below unplastered , the skeletal walls a constant commentary on the handsome solid furniture . It looked forever unused . How the columns outside , the cool verandah masked this incompleteness within . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never come , for Joe Cree wouldp186finish it right or not at all , who must have seen it as himself lasting in the brick , the future forecaught in the dwelling that would house his heir . This was Joe 's hope and purpose . But hope is not enough . The corpse on the bed was proof of that . Out of time , what time it told ! It was Jack 's sense of this which gave him the shock of a fresh view of Julia , waiting beyond the halfopeneddoor . She seemed to wait . He had come off the hot turnpike with another image of her in his mind , that half dream , half revery of her as a girl and he and his brothers acting the crucial scenes of their predicament . But that sister was not this sister . He saw before him now a full-blown woman . He took this in with all its meaning . Oh , the protean shape of love ! Where to take hold . Could he , with the wail and her arms clasped about Lucius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy intense in the embrace , taller than his mother , so that clasping him she seemed to hang , all helpless , in his arms. there was nothing helpless about her nowShe sat in the low chair they all knew so well , not touching its back , sinking slightly beneath the weight of herself into the cushionedbottom , with that unconscious show of composure which the familiar retreat can give . Here in this room there was no sway but hers . This was the impression he got above all . It showed best in her eyes . The limpid light of youth was gone , that light he had traveled by . They were now a deep azure , and they opened wide , two brimmingpools , to receive what was before them . Or rather he got the sense , for Lucius was there , masked by the door although nothing could mask the sense of his presence  --  that sense that the boy was already sinking , and only his voice was left murmuring in the room , his words fading into the monotone of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But , mama , how could he walk under a falling tree ? " Her body gave a slight start , as if some invisible cord had snapped . She did not answer at once , and then , " What is it , son , you are trying to say ? " " It 's . . . there 's something wrong . It 's not like papa to be so careless . "  |p187Her  shoulders lifted ; they fell as in a sigh ; but she made no sound . " Is n't it enough , son , I have to bear this day but that you bring me more ? " " Oh , mama . " His shame brought him forward into view . His face was full of color ; his arms lifted slightly then fell again . He did n't seem to know where to look . Quietly , sure they would not notice , Jack pushed the door open a few more inches . In the seconds it had taken him they had shifted their positions . Julia was now in profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a downward flow . It was all a natural gesture but the effect was of such subtlety . Her hands , one in the other , made a small bowl in her lap . The silence seemed to rise from the cupped hands , lazily spiraling around them both . Lucius lifted his head in appeal . " It 's just that , mama . I 'm trying to save you more . " " You go about it , then , in a strange way . With your suggestion of unthinkable things . " " But papa had such hopes of the timber . " " I know . " A shade of abuse came into her voice . She paused to make sure he took this in . " Your papa was visionary . " " Oh , but it was this . . . " " His recklessness ? " " No 'm . He was only bold . I know what he risked . He did n't want you to know . He did n't want to worry you . " She beckoned him to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parried , " You think I do n't know ? " Her tone was that of an understanding between two adults , of the restraint of suffering , of forbearance . Lucius looked down as if he needed time to take this in , and with his head still bowed , his voice low and puzzled , " You mean you knew what he risked ? " " What he risked ? " Her voice came full and resonant . " How could I not know ? I wonder if he knew so well , or cared ? " This brought Lucius up , but he explored no further than hisp188surprise . " You mean you knew what he staked ? That it was every-thing ? " Now it was she who seemed to hesitate . She looked at her hands upon her lap , at the gold wedding ring . She turned it on her finger , slowly . The sun in bars flared ; the gold band glowed dully . The pause was filled with some mystery it withheld , of her hesitancy before a decision rare and final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept the rug at their feet . Her hands , apart , made the slight gesture of a decision reached . " Everything , " she said . " Everything ? " he repeated . She bowed . Oh , with what supple grace , with just the restraint in its giving , did her neck bend . Lucius did not see it . He could see nothing but her mouth as the words , " He gave the excuse of the timber for wandering away . Whatever the excuse , did that make me any the less abandoned ? " " Oh , not abandoned , mama ! " " I 've had practice for my weeds . " She brought her hands to her face . Lucius was at her knees . " I 'll take care of you , " he said . " You know that , do n't you . " She quickly recovered herself . Such depths of knowledge looked down upon him . " You will have your own life . Some day a wife . " " But what has that to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry , at her lack of understanding . " No , " she said . " The farm is too involved . I wo n't let you throw your youth away . On it or me . " " Papa only wanted to make it better for us . I 'll do what he would want me to do . " " How ? " she asked , and in the word were insuperable obstacles . " I have such plans ... " And then he saw her tears . He put his head into her lap to hide his own . She stroked his hair absently . Absently her voice matched the rhythm of her strokes , " At first Idid n't miss him so much . The farm filled my days , but even in thebusiest season there was a hollow that gnawed . I grew to know , tolove the care of the farm , but this only showed me how deprived Iwas . " Her voice was full ; yet it remained steady . " And then thep189nights . Alone , in an unfinished house . How close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands and dropped them . " And then he took you away . " " It was for me to learn . " " It might have been you who was killed . " The force of her tone made Lucius sit up . " Was it for that , " he asked ; he was whispering , " you quarreled ? " " Quarreled ? " She seemed to be trying to remember . " About taking me from you . " His voice was barely audible . " Did we quarrel ? " " You were not the same together . I felt . . . " What he felt brought him slowly to his feet and slowly away towards the north window . " He took you to the woods , " she said harshly . Her voice looped the space between them . It caught him and he stopped . She waited , alert , watching his back . She watched it as if the distance it put between them was more than she could bear . Then recklessly she said the words that must bring him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My brothers took me there as a little girl . " Jack could not believe she would let herself go so far . And then her body , relaxing , told him Lucius was turning with his question . " Was it the woods ? " There was all the boy 's need to know in the directness of the question . She gave him no answer . She merely gazed , to know she had him back . He blurted out , " Was it my fault ? " " Yours ? " As if only now just understanding the true direction they were taking , she stood in alarm . " I 've felt it , " he said more quietly . Jack saw he could delay no longer . He pushed open the shieldingdoor . " Well , where is the coffin ? " He asked brusquely . " Coffin ? " They gasped as clumsy swimmers submerged find air . " You know , that tight six-foot box that 's never tight enough . "  |p190Jack  threw open the blinds . The light leaped at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can see by this there 's need for haste . " He waited for his words to make their effect , until he began to feel he had waited too long . He felt a sudden shyness , a reluctance to meet their stare . Outside the sun was free of the clouds , and the green scum on the pond in the barn lot lay sodden before the brightness of its shine . Upon the pond 's rim the old belted sow was lying in the mud , grunting full and soft . Jack closed the blinds with a weak hand , closed his eyes . Out of the dark well the balm of words began to rise . " The dog days . All the passion of fecund summer comes to such a day . A green scum , a fever on the waters . That pause between plowing time and gathering time , as if nature had slapped a poultice to draw the poison , that the harvest be sweet . But beware the pause . " He slowly paced the room . Julia had resumed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and voice . " Beware the pause . When the creeks run sick and the swimmer gets sores . For the fever carries . It 's a time to let nature alone . And what of a year , this year , when the crop even falls in the dog days ? Find that in the almanac if you can , or take to bed and draw the covers up and pray for winter . " He stopped now , between them but at a distance . They made three points of a triangle , as invisibly the silence drew the sides and drew Lucius 's gaze and Julia 's to him , the apex . In that instant of fixity , bound by the law of angles , he saw he had to choose where no choice was . He met his sister 's eyes . They did not waver . There was only their bottomless azure depths . His own began to swim .. . " You must be drunk , Uncle Jack , " Lucius said . His voice cut the room in two . In that instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had heard ; but he only felt the shock of what he saw . Lucius 's eyes were almost closed , but under the lids he saw , fairly glittering , a look meant only for him . That look  --  to let it grow in all the interpretation implicit in it  --  he knew would bring them both , and not only them , upon thep191brink of the abyss . They were at the brink , but not yet teetering , when the knock came . It saved them ; it postponed by diversion , that old palliative of surrounding the object , the diffusion which saves us all from the shock of crises neither the body nor spirit can bear . There must be time to heal the rent , to let the scar toughen as crisis mounts to crisis . It was Dickie , in his true character of healer , who made it . Not the medicine man , not the pill toter , but the maimed comforter . What if his caduceus was a walking stick ? By its support he thumped in on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Joe 's old company , to tell them death was not just a family matter . Joe 's friends filed in like soldiers long familiar with such matters . They stood in line as if at command . Nothing showed in Julia 's face of the scene just past . She receivedthem , not rising from her chair but seated in the full sovereigntyof her sorrow , making of this show of their intimacy with the house the restraint which could make her sorrow and theirs bearable . Suddenly her beauty in this mold of sorrow seemed all waste . Joe 's friends blinked and stared , as if they had not expected to find her here . In her presence , all together , even at the same moment , they saw how they were parodying their youth . Winston became aware of his paunch and surreptitiously tried to button his coat . Skaggs stood more erect , but his shoulders by this only showed the more their droop . Semmes 's clean linen seemed an offense . They shifted their feet in a kind of panic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the room which had seemed overcrowdedassumed its common proportions . Then Winston , " Do n't you worry , Miss Jule . We 'll take care of everything . " The old words of comfort which say everything and say nothing before the brute fact , but which allow for the act as if it were just another act . Only Lucius paled when his mother told him to take his father 's friends and show them where the grave must be dug . Without a word the boy held the door , looking straight before him , as if his sight were straining beyond him , as if somewhere in the air he would find the support outside himself upon which to lean . Without a word the men followed . There was a fumbling movement ; they bowed , so slightly they seemed only to nod and then leftp192the room separately , their black hats hanging loosely against their legs . Jack watched them fade from view in the passageway . Suddenly he felt an exposure . Lucius had left the door open . He went over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infected air , knowing he had only shut it out for a while . But in the little sewing room he felt the privacy the family needs as it withdraws from the crisis that has brought it together . It was an older privacy they felt . Joe 's death had returned Julia to her brothers . Even Lucius seemed alien now .... " How like that picture of mama you look , sister , " Dickie said . She dropped her head and covered her face with her hands . She wept hard and briefly ; then felt in her bosom for a handkerchief . Dickie made loud angry thumps as he brought her a piece of mending . As she wiped her eyes , she showed nothing hidden , nothing guarded . In the room now each face showed the naked repose of being alone ; there was no sense of aloneness . Dickie sat near her on the ottoman and he , Jack , upon the daybed . " Mind , " she said to him , " you 'll rumple that dress . " Jack half rose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so heavily had his body responded to the repose the bed offered . She folded it methodically and tossed it to the sewing table . " That was good of them to come , " she said . " I rode out from town with them , " Dickie said . " Everybody seemed shocked . Joe was the balance wheel in this county . " There was silence now in the room , but it was not this which Jack felt . It was that old timeless communion of the family , its special language which scarcely needed but sometimes used the common speech . His flesh was one full sigh of contentment . The strain of the last few days was working out of him like sweat . He felt a great longing for sleep , to stretch out on the daybed and sleep and wake and find them here , with the door forever shut , never to open upon what claimed them beyond it . He became aware of the scent of orris root and of Julia afresh . He would have to send for fresh clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wrung him dry as a dishrag and his clothes as sour from the whiskey and thep193purging , and that itchy clammy bottom to his feet , and his boots rubbing like a bad conscience . He pushed himself up against the wall , " Well . Joe 's mishap has brought us all together again . The world sloughed off like proud flesh . A few pieces missing . Dickie 's shy a leg . Julia short a husband , and I 've give up hunting my virginity . " " Oh , Brother Jack , " Julia said and Dickie frowned . And then they gave in to the silent shaking laughter , and all the muscles in his belly Jack felt to slacken in comfort and release . " Hush , " Julia said . And Jack , " The old blood measures the same . Out of the old family recipe . We might swap it pint by pint and the heart never miss a beat . " After this they all sat a long while without speaking , sometimes looking towards the blinds , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darkening the room . Suddenly Julia said , " I must see about soaking those hams . " " I would n't do that , " Dickie said . " There wo n't be time . " " Of course not . What was I thinking ? " she said . " There it is again , " Jack said , almost angry . " Time . Ca n't we let it alone ? Let it do its work without hiring out to it ? " " But there 's so much to see to , Brother Jack . " And then as if to herself , " I wish I knew how many people there 'll be to feed . " She sat with that alert inward look of the good housekeeper , sorting in her mind the things to be done . And in this sorting , Jack felt as a mystery , how the very occasion for it was lost in the intricacies of her domestic economy . Her hands unconsciously went to the pocket where she kept her keys . She looked up startled , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where did I put them . " She was on her feet , looking here , flustered and yet with rapid movements about the little room . She lifted the mending from off the sewing table , and soon Dickie was following her about . She turned on him sharply , " Do n't follow . Look . " And then , " Get up , Jack . Maybe you are sitting on them . "  |p194He  lumbered to his feet . " Flood , fire , drought or death , a woman reaches for her keys . " " If I do n't find them , " she said . " And so it will be on the last day , with the trumpeting and coming up to judgment . There 'll be one sound to drown all others , that rattle of keys and the women busy fixing up a snack to keep up the strength of some poor damned soul . " " This is no time for talk , Jack Cropleigh . I 've got to find those keys , or I do n't know what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storeroom , " he said . " You wo n't have anything left in them this time tomorrow night anyway . " " Jack . " She stopped and looked at him . " Will you hush . " At that moment Jack again felt the exposure , the chilling draught in its return , and instantaneously the words , " And the coffin , mama , is that lost too ? " Lucius was standing just inside the door . Jack 's first impression was that he had never left , until he saw the change that had come over the boy . He had come back to them with a fresh awareness of himself . There had been no reproof in his question . It was quietly put , and he waited with a slight frown at his brows , in no way conscious that he showed the right to ask questions and have them answered . An angry flush darkened his mother 's neck , blooding her cheeks . She replied , " Go ask your Cousin Charles . " He seemed not to take this in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The apples were always brought to the house . How could anybody think to take the coffin off the porch ? " " You know your Cousin Charles always gathers the apples . Go to him . " Her voice was barely audible , as if she had received a deserved reproof . Unwillingly and with anger at the boy he saw the blood in her cheeks and neck was still there . It seemed suddenly the color of guilt . Lucius had not moved , nor had the rest of them changed their postures . The silence seemed to separate and confine them wherep195they were . Jack dropped his eyes , and there against his boots lay an apron and showing through the pocket the household keys . He quickly took them . " Here , sister . " " Oh , where did you find them ? " And then distractedly , " I must go to the kitchen , " and with a quick tread walked out of the room , her neck a little forward , her eyes on a downward slant . She took no notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his uncles as if for an explanation . " Go , do what she said , " Dickie told him . " You know how absent-minded Charlie is . He 's misplaced it somewhere . " And Jack , " You 'll find it somewhere in the dead wood of all those genealogical trees . But sprinkle youself with toilet water and stuff cotton up your nose . The air is thick and noxious there . " " There 's need of haste , Lucius , " Dickie said . " Yessir , " the boy replied . This time as he left he shut the door . " The remarkable thing , " Dickie said , " is the way she goes on at a time like this , as if everything , liens and notes , the weather even , is some kind of child 's play which when it 's gone too far , she will set to rights , just as soon as she can take time from what really matters , such as giving out the food or finding dust under the table .... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe is ruined . His property will go under the hammer . " " No , " Jack said , drawing himself up on the couch . " No , I did n't know it was that bad . " " It 's worse than that . He went a good many notes . These properties will go down , too . There 's no telling where it will end . As long as he was alive , his skill in business , his name and influence kept things tossing like balls in the air . It was a precarious timing , but he kept it . The irony is that if he had lived to cut the timber , everything would have been all right maybe . " " If he had lived , " Jack repeated slowly . " If . The word which should have begun the gospel that never got written . It did n't have to be , for it 's told every hour of the day . Try it to any scale and it sings the same old song , Paradise lost and the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fact is Joe Cree killed himself.  | " Jack ! " " Well . Say then somebody told Joe something he did n't need toknow and it upset him so he did n't watch where he was going . " " Joe , " Dickie said stubbornly , " was not a man to kill himself . " " No . Nor is any man , but men have been known to do it . " " Joe was a man of honor . " Jack looked at his brother with compassion . He saw the sweat glisten upon his forehead . He said more gently , " So he was . And honor is a code that works so long as everybody agrees to the rules . It 's got teeth in it . It 's why even in a democracy it works now and then , for the man of honor backs it with his life . He says I will live only on such terms , and if you do n't meet them , I will call you out . But can you call out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Me , " Dickie said but only his lips moved . Slowly Jack shook his head . " And make an open scandal . Confessto the world you have been tricked by your wife 's kin ? And ruin Lucius , not only whom he loved but who is also defenseless . And how can a man outright , after eighteen years , believe his son is not his son ? With his mind maybe , but not the heart . And that 's where the code breaks down , for honor needs a clean and shining light . Is it not vindicated always at the break of day , just when the dark is sped ? Tell me this . Which dies at night to be renewed at dawn , the head or the heart ? And tell me this , which killed Joe Cree , honor or love ? " " I thought it for the best , " Dickie said . " What I did . I was trying to save Julia from our failure to look after her . I took the chance Joe would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this . " He let his words drift away and then he looked at Jack with alarm . " Whoever told Joe ... " " Might tell again . " Jack took it up . " That 's the burden Joe has bequeathed to us . It might salve your conscience some . " " To know that we must share ? " " To know that we have it all now . " There was a light thump at the window . Both brothers turned to see a bee falling back from the glass . Outside a swarm of bees wasp197cutting the air into streamers , and then several in sucession hit the panes angrily . Jack said , " Somebody forgot to tell the bees . " Dickie got up and hobbled to the window . Suddenly as they had come , the bees left , and then he spoke , " Maybe Joe 's last thoughts were not all of honor , " and in his voice was all the fullness of a resolution not to flinch or look away . " We must save them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead , " Jack said and left his brother alone in the sewing room . In the portico which joined the office to the house Jack saw his man , John Greer . He was leaning against one of the small square posts . His shoulder seemed to be holding it in place ; and yet so inert his body , so effortless his repose , he seemed a shadow forever fixed . Instinctively Jack glanced at the declining sun , and then John was coming towards him in his brisk , mannerly way . He wondered how long he had been waiting to speak to him . " Everything all right at home ? " " I had to drench the blue mule . " " Just let me go away from home ... " " He 'll make it , " John said . They stood there , and he became aware in the off-glance with which John saw him of what an offense he must have been in Julia 's little sitting room . He said , " You better fetch me some fresh clothes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there 's nothing else pressing , I 'll go change . " " Amon come for his cotton-picking money . " " He owes me most of that . " " Yessir . He out of bread . " " You tell him for me he 'll always be out of bread trying to keep up two women . " John waited ; then , " I drawed you a bucket of water . " " You want to wash me , too ? " " You plenty able to do that for yourself . " They looked at each other . Neither of them smiled . " All right , "  |p198Jack  said . " Weigh him up a barrel of corn  --  no , you 'd better make it a bushel of wheat ; we 'll need all our corn to feed . And give him a dollar and tell him I 'll see him . But I do n't see why ... " " Those chillurn got to eat . " " I do n't see why it 's up to me to feed two families because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sister tie up with a nigger like Anion . " " I did n't have nothing to do with it . " " Neither did I , but then she 's not my sister . " " Maybe I ai nt got the right words for womenfolks . Maybe next time you 'll gie me the word natured enough for a woman to hear . " Jack looked sharply but met only the bland round face . " Well , I 'll go clean up , " but he delayed , for John was lingering exactly as he did when he considered one of his orders either foolish or impossible to carry out . He stood a little way off , respectfully , with that perfect decorum he never lost and by means of which he said and did whateverhe pleased , except that today the smile was missing from his yellow round face . The muddy eyeballs looked at him and looked away . " All right , " Jack said . " I see there is something that does n't please you about the preparations here . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not my funeral . When I die , you can wash and shroud me , dig the grave , except you 'll be too busy picking the mourners to perform that little office . But you ca n't run this funeral . You might get around Sis Jule , but you wo n't get around Rhears . Why ai nt he at the house ? " " He keeping time and weighing up the cotton . " " This is no time for that . " " Yessir . Miss Jule sont word for him to stay there until they picked out . With everybody picking one crop before they goes on to the next , Rhears the onliest one can keep the time straight . " This was all very strange , at such a time . It disclosed a thing too distraught . If he could only fit it all together . . . he said , " I guess you carried the word . " " Miss Jule told me to stop by and tell him on my way to ast Mister Suds would he come barbecue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? " " He awful sorry about her trouble . He be glad to help anyways he can . " " Usually people stop for a funeral , but if they a n't going to do it here , you 'd better make yourself useful . " " Ai nt enough wood to barbecue a chicken . " " Rustle up some then . " John looked at the sky and studied it carefully , and then he let the words drop , " That box , it setting under the old winesap . " So this was what he had been waiting to say . In the silence Jack felt the chasm which underlay their life together . He knew at once how far John 's loyalty had been strained to tell him this . With Rhears away in the fields , it would fall to his lot to bring the coffin in . It was not a duty he would want to perform . He would require specific directions ; he would be the instrument but he would take no responsibility whatever in the matter . As if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " That box knowed his time war n't due . " " Anyway , you better bring it to the house . " " What with ? " " The spring wagon . " " That box half full of apples . " " What of it ? " " I ca n't lif it . " " Dump the apples , then . " " And let the hogs eat them ? " " Listen , that coffin is long overdue . You get Rhears , tell him I say to take time off from the cotton and help you bring it in . It 's his job anyway . " John bowed his head , nodding to the words ; and he knew hewould feel better about it taking Rhears with him . Jack watched himslowly take off , barely pausing to say , " I brought you a jug . " " You 'll be rewarded hereafter . Where 'd you put it ? " He cut his eyes slyly around , " In the slop jar in the office . " Then all full of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking how that coffin was always turning up to bother people . That flush of anger turn to .. . was it guilt , on Julia 's face ? What made him think of guilt , when at most Julia could only blame herself for negligence . How could she blame herself even for that ? Sooner or later everything on a farm will be put to use . There are never enough tools or hands in certain seasons . Never enough storeroom . It was natural that in the press of work , when all the cotton had opened at once and every sack in use , somebody would take the box to the tree and there load it . He felt a slight shiver at his spine , he had stripped his clothes but it was not the early evening air , he knew , that made him shiver . He poured the water in the bowl on the hearth . The strong cleansing smell of a dead fireplace cleared his head and he began washing rapidly . He dried briskly , and the effort brought fresh sweat all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up his dirty clothes and dropped them gingerly in the corner , as if the very touch might now contaminate him . Their foulness was stifling and the window was stuck , but he could not open the door , as he must have privacy , in his person and to think . He could at least empty the dirty water into the slop jar . He stood for a moment , looking down and over the brimming bowl , the faint odor of soap and the body 's waste rising to his nostrils . The jar 's top , he saw , was chipped and faded , but the design clear : painted roses among the painted leaves , the handle one full-blown blossom upraised out of three perfect leaves . " Here 's an artist with a vision , " he said to hear the sound of his voice . " Love 's old sweet song . Every petal a perfection and open to eye and hand . And abominations beneath . " He clasped the hard china top and lifted it . There was the jug and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now why had he put it in the slop jar ? To hide it maybe , but that sly look of his . No , John had put it there to remind him of their common frailty , in this way to redress the inequalities of the world . Well , John was always putting him in his place . That was why he was such a good servant . He took the whiskey out and emptied the slop and clattered the china top back in place.  | " That 's more like it , " he said . Feeling pure and light and almost gay he dressed ; took a small drink and sat down . The drink went quickly to his head . All the heaviness there dissolved , and for the moment he felt his flesh purifiedby the washing he had given it , his skin sparkling with blood , and beneath  --  was that its location ? He felt no call to probe this wonderful feeling of repose ; it seemed to have nothing to do with his body proper but was of an essence rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nowhere could he feel the wood touch or pinch . And then it came as a mystery revealed , how common water on the common flesh may wash also the spirit clean , make whole again , renew hope in all men 's acts , wise and foolish , good and bad. the chair pinched , and he shifted his weight . But no act resolves itself of itself . There 's the will , the imagination , and the risk . Else are we lifted and set down as idly as summer dust . Now that he was alone , his head clear , he would pick up the threads , for who else was there to do it . Unravel the past : weave the present . To what pattern ? A pattern to keep Lucius from being undone by the knowledge this fresh death will bring up , for open the ground as you will the WAS jumps up as the NOW goes in and no time for the amenities . In and out , the two motions which make a whole but never are a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tried to deny . Duncan and Beverly , each in his way . And where had it brought them all ? Into the folded cove after the long hunt , to the spongy sod and rock , and like babes in the wood Julia sleeping in Pete Legrand 's arms .. . this unraveling  --  he must break no thread. and then her arm in Joe Cree 's arm , standing before the candles and the smilax in Aunt Emm 's front hall , so soon after and yet too late . And not once did he see the valley lilies tremble on her crown as Joe slipped the ring on her finger . Trailing clouds of glory , hell .. . Snip the cord as quick as you will on the female babe , the womb whispers to the blood , guard the secret , hide the secret , disguise the secret . It 's a marvel forever . And Julia in white she 'd no right to wear , in her disguise looking everything she was supposed to be , and Aunt Emm knowing , crumpled in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because she foreknew it , the time when the blood will say , I 've moved to a fresher vessel . And Joe looking down and squarely into Julia 's blue eyes , straight on , seeing what he did not understand , the tenderness of surrender all there in his not her eyes . There was the mystery confronted , virgin and woman in one . And the mystery of folly , too , if folly it is , for a man to think he can look at a woman straight on and ever focus again . That look , that day , minted the two silver coins now on his eyes , round as a full moon , with a lady in each . Whoever saw two full moons except with eyes out of focus ? And the moon in the sky to warn any man with sight to see , when she swings into the full , her face in profile , shining pale , her hair all curled in clouds and the ear beneath for whispering . There 's the clue , and the wise lecher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood where the woman is listening all the time , preferringthe word to the deed . In that crimson whorl the oldest word seems that instant made . True or false , it 's no matter there , when it speaks the language of the blood . The deed will be done , the monotonousdeed . The shadows were at the window ; time , Jack saw , had sped . He lifted the jug and drank deep , and drank alone. and Brother Curran says , Who gives this woman to this man ? I said the sparrow I do , I said , stepping forward and back , and words read backwards in any mother tongue , man talking to keep his courage up . For the blood knows . A girl child is born and it 's all in the way of like for like , but when the man child plunges loose and the womb snaps back  --  there 's the miracle , the square peg in the round hole . And she did it and nobody helped her . Duncan , poor Duncan , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in sight of him , Brother Curran going on with questions and answers , and Duncan quivering as if at any moment he would bolt , his eyelids rolled back into his body 's spasm  --  like the dead coming to on the last day. and Dickie , Brother Dickie , with his quiet smile , watching whatp203he had brought about but with an eye now and then for Duncan , throwing the unknown , the ravished heart an admonitory frown . I saw , and while the guests and bridesmaids crowded around the wedded pair , I led Duncan off . He followed like a sleepwalker going backwards to his dream . He drank the champagne like a docile child ; and at the second glass his taste came back . He watched the bubbles break and rubbed his nose ; and then tears large as glycerine drops fell down his nose . " For Christ 's own sweet sake , " I said , " pull yourself together , " and I led him into the back of the back hall . " Quit thinking of yourself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . Only marriage is a different kind of love . " That look he gave me and then dropped his head on my shoulder and sobbed , if sobs they were . It was as if he had hacked his insides out . In a few moments he drew back . His voice was calm , a little hard , " I will , " he said , and , " Could n't Cree get any honest whiskey for his nuptials ? " I put the two glasses in his hands and filled them with the amber bubbles and said , " Now , go find your partner . That little brunette bridesmaid in pink . She wants a good time . " And with all the grace he had , he went towards her and scarcely a ripple in the wine . She was waiting near the bridal table . Aunt Emm had borrowed the horn of plenty . What it cost her no one knows , for she had to make the quick marriage seem long preparing . The board was loaded with jellies and creams and sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center a tremendous pile of egg kisses under a gauze spun of sugar . They drank ; she coughed and prettily struck her breast . She was young . Her coquetry , I thought , pleased him . He said , " Let 's rob the nest , " and with his finger slit the sugar veil and lifted , oh with such skill , one of the kisses from the pile . " Is this your kiss , Mr. Duncan ? " she asked . I thought all was well , found my partner and wandered into the hall where the meats and salads were. the fiddlers playedand wedding party and guests gathered in the parlor for the bride to cut the cake . By this time I had forgotten Duncan , although his voice would rise from the hum of merriment and talk like thep204restatement of the theme in music , a little too high , a little too strained , but not enough to cause me alarm , or prepare me . I was caught up too , and the champagne gave me no pain . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiers was on the marble top , and Joe 's hand on Julia 's , the last symbolic act before the act , Joe in tight pants and cutaway coat and white waistcoat of brocaded satin , leaning over her , his face transformed  --  he seemed now the youth which even as a youth he never showed  --  he scarcely touched her , seeming a hovering strength , and I thought , He is equal to all we 've put on him . Dickie has handled this with skill and I caught his eye and nodded , Well done ; Dickie in plain view with Amelie beside him . They were holding hands , their bodies touching , with the crowd to blame if any noticed . A handsome woman , raw-boned but not thin , with lips too full for her mouth , her eyes all liquid as if the slightest jar would make them , spill . Freshly widowed , just out of her weeds and with property . As the knife cut down , I saw her hand squeeze his . Their eyes met , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the flow of her neck . There 's always one part of the body which gives meaning to the whole , and with Amelie it is the neck . It affirmed the strength of her shoulders . Always it swayed with that old fearsome grace . The slightest movement and the head responded , forever undulating , never at rest . But the end of that toss was a stillness . It held two seconds but that was enough for her eyes to meet those of Duncan . To Dickie it was a gesture completed , her attention all for him but heightened . But the eye , that old assassin , had killed his hopes . The eye , when you hate , may meet eye straight on and sink to the heart , for there 's nothing to risk . And Duncan out of his hurt had flung his brother into waters he had never tried . I looked to make sure , and there Duncan stood like a hunter over the kill , the smile set to his teeth , the pupils like the points of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scarred Duncan 's face . It was obscene , so much hurt and so much cruelty open to any gaze . But none saw but me . The fiddlers were tuning for the dance , old Lige Gannaway scraping his bow , bowing , calling Genmums choose your ladies . But the choice had already been made . The bridep205and groom led off the first set , and the first tap of the toe , and the tap , tap , tap of the foot , heel and toe , and then the circling shuffle . And the fiddles screaming and the fiddle bows forward and back , and the rhythmic thump of the banjo , beneath the tune the thump , the beat of blood steady and full , swelling with the figures , quickeningbut never losing the beat . Sharp and staccato Duncan 's voice , the thrust into the void , " Forward and back , " bowing to the little brunette , his partner , but masked by the bow his glance for Amelie . And Lige calling " The Ocean Wave , " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up erect and taut , like buoys upon the sea 's swell , while separate from this pliant stiffness knee ankle and foot bend , beat , twisting , fast to the rapid demands of the fiddles , moving only to the commands of the music .. . Between sets the champagne passed , sparkling in the thinstemmedglasses , the silver trays glowing white and gold , and Aunt Emm moving among guests and servants like a fretted ghost , directinghere , correcting there , the servants stiffening at her approach . She wonders if the food will hold out ; her eye counts the silver ; she passes from kitchen to parlor , mumbling , " Will it never end ? " And the black musicians , laughing at the bubbles , gulping the wine , and with one long scrape of the bow the dance resumes . In the middle of a set all together and at once the guests feel something missing , and the little brunette cries , " They have gone upstairs . " Lige presses down on the bow , lifts the fiddle from chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes rolling towards the ceiling in a mockery of ecstasy , calls out , " Cage the bird . " And now the thud , and the thud of the dance , but the dance delayed as the figure changes until it seems the floor was keeping time to the music . Hands clasped around the ring , the bodies arched and still , like a chain of paper dolls all cut from the folds of one paper  --  but only an instant ; then the ring circling the captured bird , forwardand back , then treading the ring , reversing the flow , skirts swirling , the thumping feet become one foot , up and down . The floor boards quiver , giving and returning with the one rhythm , the music high and far away , like shrill insects sawing the air .. .  | " Now cheat and swing , " Lige Gannaway sings out. and Amelie the widow breaks into the center . Neck curving , riding the flow , her curls bobbing , she dances first to one and another , but swinging away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will at the proper moment choose him , before them all . That is the custom , that is the expected thing . But the smile dries on his face . It is Duncan 's arms that hold her , lightly but surely , the very lightness the mark of possession . Did she cheat too close , meaning to ; or was he too quick ? None could tell nor did any ask , but every eye had fastened upon them , now the hub of the wheel vibrating the rim , now dashing but oh so lightly around the binding cage . Now only the swaying circumference , the surrounding couples watched the meaning of their feet unwind . Lige drew near with his fiddle ; his bow took its time from Duncan 's foot . And as they danced , from corner to corner , always the couple returned to center ; then quietly , even soundlessly as a leaf from the bough , Duncan released his partner , so slowly drawing away that only the music told the frenzy of his feet . Only then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come of the perfect whole wrenched apart , Amelie barely shuffling , docile , waiting for the return . As a hummingbirddarts , Duncan danced towards her , around her , in a corner alone : the blind search , forever seeking , forever thwarted , never recovering what he has lost , the half that will make him whole . From the stamp of his feet the tortuous wilderness grew in the room . Through its gloomy corridors the dance carried him , around slimy pools , or suddenly into an open glade , open to the far sky and its sudden shower of gold , and back again , mottled in green , over the shaded floor . As Duncan wove this pattern , the ring of bodies closed about him and Amelie , but it was he that drew them , panting , and the male sweat and the sweet astringency of scent and chalk fused , rolled in the heavy air of the parlor like mist , and the beast rolled over . The little brunette cried out , " I ca n't breathe . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high this foot , then the other , the thighs spread in their strain , he broughtp207them down to every fourth beat ; the fiddles were high , the guitar strumming bass . The tight fawn pants , the brocaded waistcoat rippled over his muscles . He seemed at one moment upside down prancing on the air ; at another like one falling , kicking for a hold in the empty space of his fall . Amelie 's neck was at last stilled ; her feet had ceased to move . Her eyes were two ripe pears falling .. . half man , half beast , the dancer now threaded the maze . Always he seemed about to escape ; yet always came back upon himself , back to center out of the corridors , out of the twisted ways blocking sight , returning to the one circle , the exact center from which he had been expelled . And all the while the dancers ringed closer , but now stopped , not only eyes but heads down upon the spot to which he had come . There he held , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shreds , the blood all ribboned with dust tangling at the hocks . The guitar thrummed three times : the quivering sound died away : the beast had emptied itself of its anguish . Then suddenly the dancer throws his head up , his nostrils all aquiver before the acid teasing scent blowing downwind . Duncan looks at Amelie and the smile scalds his face . He leans forward and slowly paws the floor . Lige lifts his bow like a whip . " Intermission , " he calls . The dancers remain in their spell ; then one sighs , a couple breaks the ring . They drift apart . Dickie remains , his eyes glazed over , pale , tight lines at his mouth . The little brunette slips her arm into his . He follows like a man who is being led . The gaiety is smothered ; voices murmur low in the parlor ; ladies lean behind their fans and whisper . A loud crash sounds from the kitchen ; the guests lift their heads , and afterwards they begin to move to and fro aimlessly ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong house . When the trays of wine pass , hands reach too eagerly . The servants frown as they balance the swaying trays . More wine is called for . The servants seem slow , but the wine holds out until at last the voices grow animated again . They rush together ; spill over from room to room . They rise and fall in waves of sound . Above the surge women 's laughter breaks and scatters . The dance resumes.  |p208The  dance resumes but Amelie and Duncan do not make a part of it . They are seen no more by the guests that night . So that they will not be missed , or if missed , make a scandal , Dickie is to be seen everywhere at once . He slaps this man on the shoulder ; he brings some tidbit to a lady resting ; he bows before a wallflower . For the old ladies sitting in the faint aroma of camphor he orders milk punch , but his eyes are not there . In the deepest part of the night old Doctor Randall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorum , kicks off his shoes and jigs like a boy . The wine has done its work . This is the moment Dickie has awaited . He slips away , knowing he will not be missed . Furtively he withdraws to open and close Aunt Emm 's many doors until the unbelievable belief , the inevitable door stands ajar . His hands rise like a blind man feeling air ; they fumble the door 's edge . Slowly it swings to ; his shoulder rolls against it , stooped , as if too weary to ever move again . And so Duncan runs away with Amelie . There is none to forbid or counsel a widow ; and Dickie , with his diploma already framed on the wall , runs back to medical school , for what took place when Duncan ended his dance was beyond Dickie 's medicine , Amelie the young widow swimming out of eddy water back into the main current . What is a widow but knowledge deprived , and what did Amelie see but her loss restored . Did the trampling scare her ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , matching her own hurt , and she had the very salve to heal it . She thought she had . She was deluded . It was a husk she took that night , the passionate husk . Grasp it so tight not even a blade of grass can slip between , and yet she found always another there . This she must have learned with what bitterness he could only surmise . Yet she did not give up , else she would not have followed Duncan to the war . That surely was her desperate bid for love , but it was death she drew and afterwards she was out of hope and full of hate  --  for Julia . What can so well ease a memory festering from spoiled hope as hating the cause , so that hate can seem a good , easing so deep a hurt . What a role has Julia played in Amelie 's mind ! " Dickie , why did you run to medical school ? " Jack said aloud.  | " I was weak in surgery , " the voice replied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind so fluid it had no bounds ? Had it seized the very tone of Dickie 's thoughts , given voice to silence ? . . . and then he felt the slight shock and the chair arms like thongs in his flesh . His eyes widened upon the dark swelling in the office , and there leaning in the doorway , framed by the last blue of dusk , was Dickie , his good leg firm to the floor , his peg thrust forward with the awkward balance of a mannequin in a window . From outside the air blew fresh , as from some distant rain . The two brothers regarded each other in that alert stillness which accompanies nightfall . Jack said , his words flickering tongue and lips , " One hour goes into the next . Time is a chain , but the past is the only tense that conjugates the present . There you are , Brother Dickie , to prove it . " Dickie remained in a silence that would not free him . " Well , did n't you run away ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " To keep the surface smooth ? " " Is n't that all anybody can do ? " Dickie answered quietly . " Keep the surface smooth ? " Jack reached for his jug . " Come in . Take a drink . " And Dickie entered with his clumsy swing . He felt the swell of remorse for blaming his brother ; then annoyance at the soft thumping of the peg , the deliberate movement . He said gruffly , " It takes more than court plaster to mend a heart . " The chair opposite scraped the floor . And then the pause as the chair stretched and creaked before the body settling , as deliberately Dickie drank , at last thumped the jug upon the writing drawer of the secretary . " That helps , " he said . He wiped his sleeve across his mouth . " Winston and the others are washing Joe . They may have trouble getting his clothes on . " " A man dresses every day , " Jack said , " but the day comes when no clothes fit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show where he 's going . "  | " It wo n't show anyway . We 'll have to put the top down right away . " " Greer got in with the coffin then . " " He and Rhears are rubbing it down . " " They 'd better be rubbing salt on Joe . And spread aplenty in the coffin floor . " " You think that will keep it all smooth ? " The quiet bitterness of Dickie 's voice arrested him for a moment . He blurted out , " Rot and corruption ! Oh , Lord , smell me for what I am . The body 's last strain after paradise . Our noses are too impure , to stand nature so essential . And we 've found something we ca n't dilute . But we can give it the old salt cure . Pretend a few hours it 's not so , and then the old heave and the ho , and six foot under . " Dickie made a savage movement . " I knew I would find you picking at the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said evenly . " I have been thinking if you only had stepped out that night before all the guests , had said  --  Amelie is my woman . You , Duncan , keep your hands off . I was thinking if you had done that , Joe Cree and the rest of us would be going about our business , with just our common troubles . " " While you were doing all that thinking , did it occur to you it might have been too late ? No . You only see so far  --  always the image out of context : such as , Duncan and Julia wandering innocently the deep woods . Pete Legrand , you forgot him . Well , I did n't , and Julia has had for eighteen years a normal married life , and Lucius a name and a home . " " But now , " Jack said , " the eighteen years are up . " " Did you ever think it might have been too late for me , too ? " Lest Dickie 's plea for understanding might turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too harsh , " It was Amelie told Joe his boy was a bastard . " The words hung there between them . Dickie made no response and yet Jack felt the silence struggle . His accusation was beyond Dickie 's medicine , for the ailment was now Dickie 's , too . He would give him time , holding there to the roof of his mind , that unruffledp211board upon which he moved his counters with such skill , took a trick , lost one , won or lost the game . But there was the catch . The game always came around again . Except that Dickie could n't play it his way this time . " Amelie has suffered much , " Dickie said at last . " You must marry her . " Jack was surprised at the casual tone with which he spoke . Dickie did not raise his voice . " Are you mad ? " " It 's the only way to make her hold her tongue . " Dickie 's sigh was deliberate . " Try to use a little common sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You know we 've scarcely seen her since Duncan 's death . You know we are strangers to her . But granted this was not so , it would be a brutal thing to do , to offer her another loveless marriage . " " You do n't love her then ? " " Is that irony ? " " I thought you 'd been pining all these years . " " Listen . Amelie has taken enough from us . But how can you believe for a moment she would not understand such a ruse ? " " You are good at ruses . Why do n't you try to make this one work . Go see her . Maybe she 's been playing hide and seek with you . " " You did n't hear a word I said , " and Dickie thrust his peg towards his brother . " Look at this . " He waited , but Jack would not turn his head . Then , " There 's a simpler way . If you are right and I 'm not convinced she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julia can ... " " You ca n't do that , " Jack blurted out . " I ca n't ? " " His mother will need him . I can teach him his Latin and Greek . I can cipher too . " " Ah , Jack , Jack . " There was all the sadness of despair in his voice . " Look at this stump . I 'll tell you how I lost it . " " I know how you lost it . " " But you were n't there . " Jack felt the inward qualm of one who had forced a situationp212too far , but he could only say , " Well , go ahead , " and lifted the jug and drank to recover himself . As Dickie waited , he said , " Make haste . I 've got to think of something since you wo n't help . You 've never been one of us . " He had not meant to say that , and his cruelty shamed him and all the more because Dickie took no notice of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he raised it with that finality of demand which confession makes . " That day of the raid , " he said , " after you had ridden off with Amelie to take her to that house behind the lines , Duncan was impatient to set off at once . Joe refused . It was still daylight and too risky . But Duncan took Joe aside and told him something that made him agree . I suppose he told of his doubts of Beverly . Anyway we set out for Parcher 's Cove , and as we drew near , Duncan went ahead . The manner of his going worried me . It had a recklessness , a fixity , that was unnatural , for ordinarily on these raids he was the most circumspect of scouts . Why had he gone to Beverly at all ? He knew the way in and he also knew Beverly 's delusion that Parcher 's Cove , merely because he willed it , would be forever free of any human habitation but his own . Duncan 's excuse that Beverly would guide us that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I followed him to the waterfall . It was still light when I got there . Duncan had had time to find out if all was clear , but he was nowhere in sight . I swam my horse across the pool , under the waterfall of such poor luck for us , and dismounted in the rock room behind . It was dark of course but not so dark as to hide the passage . I had a torch , but more and more I had a premonition that something was very wrong . I must go on and see ; and yet at the mouth of that jagged entrance I hesitated . There 's something about a cave that draws and frightens too . The cool moist feel of it , its lightless depths and all the eyeless things lying in wait as you blindly stagger in . It 's eerie enough in broad daylight , but I had come upon it at dusk . I took a breath and felt my way in . I had not gone far before I heard the animal grunts . They reverberated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names and the names came back , wavering and mocking in the echo of such places . I could n't run over such ap213footing . I had to stop and light my torch . I had to . You must understand this . You may imagine how long it seemed before the hissing flame wavered along those narrow , sinister walls . Half running , half slipping , I came midways of the passage and saw them , locked in each other 's arms . I shouted again but again my voice seemed only to boomerang , muffle by its large sound my plea to them , for it was a plea . And then that loud maniacal laughter . It was the smile at the wedding supper turned vocal . I felt it as a chill on my skin and scalp . I hesitated , hearing only the scuffling feet , and then went further in . I went on until I smelled it , the unmistakable stench of burning powder . I even saw it on the floor at their feet . It twisted like an angry eye withdrawing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cunning Beverly had planted that fuse , stringing it to a crack that could not be reached . I sensed this , for I could not move from the spot . I was fixed there . You will say I showed the white feather . I will never know . I do n't think there was time to reach them . I tell myself there would not have been time enough to separate them . But is there time in a cavern ? Does the sun reach it , or the moon ? And yet that fuse was burning time , and then my eardrums cracked and I heard all the waterfalls in the world come down at once , explodingin light and at the center , in that eternal instant , Duncan and Beverly mashed together . I see them now forever one , and yet more than one . Does it take such violence to make perfection of what they sought in the wilderness . Do we ever find ? Can we ever help ? We can only do a small service here and there , and be stingy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I thought , So this is what it is to be dead . And then I felt the weight and the tiny knives somewhere in front of me . It was the boulder pinning my leg beneath it . " As he waited Jack felt the soughing of the dark , and then he leaned over and put his hand hesitantly upon his brother 's shoulder . Dickie took no notice of it . " Fratricide and suicide and whatever it is to give a leg . Beverly , Duncan , me . You are whole yet . At least in body . " " I 've kept the home place , " Jack said . His voice begged for agreement.  |p214But  Dickie said slowly and clearly , " The home place has deprivedyou of a home . " A soft yellow light opened upon the walls of the office . They saw John Greer bowing , the lamp in his hands , his face a shining bronze . " I brought you all some light . It 's good dark now . " Jack said automatically , " We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his white coat . He smiled for comfort , as he made his elaborate bow , outdoing them in courtesy . They filled their mugs in silence and Dickie , fingering his before he drank , said , " Am I one of us ? " Slowly Jack rose to his feet . He bowed to his brother . He tried to smile but his throat was dry . " Beverly , Duncan , Dickie , Jack , and John Greer . We are all one of us . We 'll drink to that . " " To that , " Dickie said and raised his mug . Lucius leaned against a post in the little summer house . It was good dark now . It was good to be alone . He had to be alone for a while . He had tried to stay in the house , be near his mother , but the house was outlandish . Even his own room . It began before the people came , in that silence when the rooms seemed to hold their breath , and the family and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they were hunting something mislaid but without memory of what it was . Then the house stirred , as if the doors had brought back its breath . It began to whisper , first in the hallway where Cousin Molly Pilcher met at the door those who came , mostly women at first , the men hanging back in the drive , or talking quietly together in the yard . It was so many women that marked the strangeness , leaning to Cousin Molly 's face , as if they could spare only so much breath , as if breath had found a new worth . Some nodded in a hushed conspiratorial manner , and Cousin Molly to them would raise her eyes in genteel sadness . A few , reluctantly , she sent in to his mother with  --  She 's in the chamber . At first wandering , he hunted some familiar place , but Cousin Molly 's nine girls were everywhere , in the kitchen , in the dining room . They took the food from the neighbors and guests , were theyp215guests ? they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cousin Molly with the touch of thumb and finger would raise the cloth , glance beneath , and with the barest lisp  --  Nobody but you can make bread so light ; or sometimes she would look the compliment , as if words failed her . Or lift those soft , white , helpless hands of hers towards the hamper , or cake , or the heaped bowl ; and the neighbor would hesitate an instant before releasing the gift , mistrusting the hands ; but always one of Cousin Molly 's daughters would step forward , reach for the offering , receive her mother 's faint smile . And suddenly the neighbor watching the hands withdraw , hovering in their elegance as if about to bless , and then wavering elsewhere as if forever cheated of the object . . . suddenly the neighbor in confusion remembers her own hands stiff and swollen from dishwater and picking up stove wood , and rubs their palms upon her dress , or hides them in its folds . Did Sherman make those hands , when he said he would bring every southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the washing , saying there 's one he wo n't bring to it ? Why did he fill his mind with words and faces and newfangledness ? And hands , rough or smooth . He knew what had driven him from the house , here in the garden to hide . . . then swimming before his face the coffin blocked his sight . Wedge-shaped and impervious , at last set in the parlor and that body so stiff within , the doors closed and the family gathered ; and as he looked , he almost said aloud  --  Why , he 's fat . . . and then it curled into his nostrils , thick and lazy ; it struck his stomach like a blow . What 's Cousin Charles doing in here , he thought , and looked behind , and there was nobody but his mother and uncles , then Rhears lifting the top and in his hands it seemed as light and thin as an eggshell . Those eggshells ... he fled and heard his mother 's voice , stifled , " Lucius " there on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , his stomach heaving , he said , no , no , he looks like this . But not his father 's face but the features of his Cousin Charles instead to mock him , peering furtively , the frail body shrinking , the two ends of hisp216moustache drooping towards his wet baby mouth , and the frightened voice  --  You 'll let in a draft . And with the fast shuffle gliding to the door to shut it . It sloughed to in the thick air , and the smell rolled like swollen rot in the tight room . And he could only see the pile of eggshells three feet high , and old Mattie 's voice in his ears , Mister Charlie , he suck aigs . He had always thought before it was a good cook 's revenge for one who never came to eat her food . Now , his thoughts all shattered by the literal fact , he could only look and not look at the pile of shells . He tried to concentrate and heard his voice , faint , as if his breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where is it ? " But Cousin Charles did not hear . He flitted about the room as if they were playing hide and seek , darting glances from under his red eyelids but never looking once straight on . His own back had not budged from the door ; he put his hand to the knob.  --  No. no . Do n't go . You must see . I 've hung your father to the family tree . They bent together over the table .  --  Now , here , the little old man said .  --  No . Not this . This is the line of the Lindsay Arabians . Our ancestor of revolutionary fame , Thomas Cree , brought them with him over the mountains . I keep their line , too , the noblest breed of them all . They go back to the old Dominion . I will tell you an amusing story on myself . It will not bear repeating . And he raised one slick brown finger .  --  I was tracing a collateral branch , I was perturbed , there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was , the mind is too nimble for the fingers . And do you know what I had done ? His gaze was hard and bright .  --  I had written Hannibal Morton , issue of Beau Dare , out of Gypsy Dawn . He gave a harsh dry chuckle .  --  Quite amusing eh ? Hannibal Morton , issue of Beau Dare , out of Gypsy Dawn . Of course I corrected my mistake . All the while the slick fingers were unrolling the parchment , and the tree grew before their eyes , the thick brown trunk , with names as swollen as arteries , and running off and out the skeletal limbs , the inked-in names as faint as veins . And from the limbsp217hung like picnic boxes other names . Upon one of these , at the end of a branch , the finger came down .  --  Here hangs your father , he said . Now he is safe . Here all is clear , down this limb , joining at the trunk , and down it to the roots where lies recumbent the Immigrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water.  --  Cousin Charles , where . . . ?  --  Life . You never know , it 's so ... but here they hang in unbroken line . He shouted  --  Where is the coffin ? The little man shrank away , the furtive look returned .  --  The coffin , oh yes , he said distastefully . Oh , let me see , ai nt it on the porch ? No , no , indeed no . It 's under the winesap , in the old orchard . Now , boy , for your own branch .. . Jack stepped into the night . He took a deep breath ; it tasted of distant rain ; that mule smelled it . He could tell the way it lifted its head . The barn lot was now full of mules and horses , tied to the fence rails , with heads lowered to the hay thrown wastefully on the ground . Or leaning over the fence , their big bodies still and dark , melting into shadow , the jaws side-chopping methodically , chomping the fire , the air become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blaze of the barbecue fire with a fresh log just cast on . The flames wavered but the glow was steady , a rosy light among the scattered buggies and carry-alls , their empty shafts unpraised as thin as whips , or carelessly dropped to the ground . These seemed entirely abandoned , but in the side yard , backed against the fence , stood three covered wagons down from the hills , their canvas tops half rolled back like old women 's bonnets . Against those tops the glow faded , sank down . Down the driveway a buggy was stealing away ... . Nobody kept close to the fire . Circling it , neighbors and townspeoplestood or squatted , came up , moved away . They kept it up for comfort 's sake , he guessed , for surely old Suds had enough coals for his pit . He could tell to a coal how much he needed , it was said . He trusted nobody with the barbecuing , not even his girls , although Adelaide helped skin the carcass . Adelaide . . . and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words were there  --  The home place has deprived you of a home . Suppose he and Adelaide had run away together , and he had brought her to the home place . It was his then , the property had been divided and Beverly had deeded his share for twenty-five pounds of lead and so much salt and powder , yearly paid . Suppose they had done it , and almost they had in that longest period of loneliness when he was at home alone . But then the last hunt and what it had precipitated had drawn him back . But Dickie was wrong . " Dickie is wrong , " he said harshly . There is only one home , and only the child knows it . He sucks it in at the teat ; he crawls in it , and when he stands up , it is home he walks and breathes . All else is strange , hostile . . . the woman clasped to your breast , in the house you bring her to , sacramentally blessed or otherwise , she is still strange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allotted time , it can only be as in a foreign country , well loved , well known , but with something withheld , something forever elusive . And when the children come , as come they will , they are only half kin . And there will be the one child no kin at all , taking after that outland blood you have brought to your house and heart . Dickie was such a one . It was why Dickie did not understand . A laugh wavered upon the air , gay and free , but cautious . It was from one of three squatting on their haunches , their noses to the thick rich odors rising from the pit . Was that Steele the well digger ? That was old Judge Ewing for certain standing under the hackberry , upright and fierce , the trapped ferocity of age all there in his eyes . Beside him his old cronies watched with his eyes , withdrawn into the actual shadow as they lived in the shadow of his will . An atheist , must he doubt all things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticizing old Suds as Suds knelt before the meat , holding his hands over the heat , raising them and lowering them , as if blessing it . That other figure , strange yet familiar , leaning over abruptly to thrust the shovel into the coals , now turning towards the pit . . . with a shock he saw it was Adelaide . It was the shoulders that had tricked him : they were as large as a man 's . She walked out of his gaze ,  |p219which  held fixed to that density of the air she had vacated . He stood bereft , leaning forward as if looking down a long corridor which the flame , suddenly leaping , lit up . The flame died ; Jack turned and plunged down the path , deep into the garden . Steele , rising from his haunches , said , " Whur 's Mister Cropleigh off to ? Reckon anything wrong ? " " Running after that jug he 's got hid out . " The three pair of eyes watched Jack until he passed a myrtle bush , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beef makes a body dry . " The three pair of eyes turned speculatively towards the pit , and the rich brown mound lying atop the faint glow . " I thank thar 's a swig or two in the waggin bed . " " Thank you could rustle it amongst them shucks ? " " I thank so . " The three men stood up . Separately they ambled back through the buggies and the carry-ails towards the wagons along the fence . " No , " Jack said . " I was saved for something other than domestic bliss . " And he heard his voice , strained , defensive . He waited , withdrawninto the myrtle , for his throat to relax . He felt all his weight in his boots . There was the summer house barely visible . He would go there and rest . As he passed along the path , the lights from the dwelling , from the porch lamps , burned into the dark a short way , like the artificial rays in a picture . The dwelling itself had the empty festive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and yet people were going in and out ; a few voices detached themselves from the silence , fell to the ground . Through the lace curtains at the diningroomwindows shadows wavered about the table in ghostly ritual . The spiced odor of barbecue penetrated the garden , and yet no wind stirred . " Uncle Jack ? " He stopped just without the step . This was surely a sign . He knew very well for what he had been saved . " You here , son ? " hep220asked , and they sat down on the rough bench . And yet , now that he had been given this moment , Jack felt bereft of words . Lucius said in a low voice , " I hated you this afternoon . " Nephew and uncle sat side by side , almost touching ; but neither looked at the other , but outwards where the dark tangled the vines in the lattice . " I hate myself now , " Lucius added vehemently . " But it 's more than that ... " " I just passed the mourners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Suds . If he do n't hurry with the meat , they liable to eat him . " " The mourners ? " The boy asked , startled . Jack jerked his head towards the back lot . Lucius waited , trying to respond . " Is it true , " he asked suddenly , " Cousin Suds did the washing after the war ? Because Sherman said he would bring every southern woman to the washboard ? " " Did you ever look at Molly 's hands ? " " Yessir . She lifts them so carefully , as if the air can bruise . " " It can do worse than that , " Jack took it up , his tongue freed now . " Sure old Suds washed the clothes . He washed them for two years . Who but he would keep it up for so long ? The literal act up to the armpits in suds and water , and I guess the clothes got clean enough . But they do n't stay clean . The literal mind do n't see this . It just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in motion it do n't have to see . But one day the belly growls and Suds has to go to the fields , for hunger is a real reality . And the clothes pile up . And Suds says I 'll get around to them Saturday , but Saturday comes all tangled up with the seasons and grass is in the crop . And he says next Saturday for sure . And then one day he comes in and finds fresh drawers and a shirt , and he cries out to down the terror  --  I wo n't have a lady washing . But Molly is a woman now throwing up a baby every ten months , and Adelaide a grown girl says  --  I ' 11 wash . Suds do n't hear , or if he hears , he 's said  --  One southern lady wo n't soil her hands . Just one . And if you can do a menial thing , you can do another , and so each girl as she got bigp221enough not only washed the clothes but picked up a hoe too and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll get around to those clothes , but just wearing them , as if they 'd washed themselves , just as he do n't ask how the grass got out of the crops , so long as the crop makes , for every night when he comes in from the fields , he picks up those white , those soft , those useless hands he 's ruined nine pair to keep . " " But sometimes , " Lucius said , " he must look at the girls ' hands . " " He do n't even see Molly 's . For a hand picks up and sets down . It opens and closes . It caresses . A hand does all the things it was made to do . What Suds picks up is that thing he 's put behind his sight . Put there in the terror of the truth . That 's what he sees as he lifts those hands , filling the retina with the shine of rotten wood in night 's low ground . Truth shows in the open light of day , and Suds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth was Sherman 's kind of war had ruined Suds . Complete . House gone , barn , stock , tools , slaves . Nothing but the land left , with no fence to tell its lines , the dirt of one field running into the next around the world . That 's too far to see . It 's an ailment as old as the common cold , the terror of the distant view . The Indians knew it , and in the West they had a way to tell the boy from the man . The Indian boy was always put down among the women , but the time came when they drove a stick through the fleshy part of his chest , tied thongs at each end and from there to the pole , and all day long leaning back to keep the thong tight , with head back and eyes open to the sun , he followed it blazing about the pole . And in the West there are no trees or clouds to block the view . And it may be the pain in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the drums to beat up his courage , and maybe the chanting distracted him some . But if he made the circle , the boy died but the man was there . And afterwards the horizon did not seem the promise or terror of space , nor did he see in the seasons the grind of time but in both that eternal reflection , for he had seen the circle come back on itself , and that great distance the sun comep222down to the eye , one blinding whiteness , one bright pain  --  flesh , body , time , space , center , circumference  --  forever drowned in that illumination which is all . That 's why the Indian 's eye is clear and steady . It opens at dawn and shuts at night in the afterglow of that mystery . " Jack paused , his head turned as if he were hearing the echo of his own words ; then he said , " But not the Suds and the Shermans . And after all they are cut from the same bolt of cloth . They both are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying you  --  not me  --  will be clean . " At this moment the clouds shifted and the moon showed its last quarter . In the vague haze Lucius glanced covertly at his uncle ; saw his posture take the form of some inner reflection . Out of the lull , beyond the garden , voices about the barbecue pit intrudedwith a freer , clearer rhythm . With shame Lucius felt the gnaw of hunger . Out of his sense of betrayal he blurted out , " But papa was no Suds . " Jack got up abruptly and moved to the other side of the summerhouse . He looked out its entrance , which exposed the drive as it curved towards the verandah ; then he said with deliberate care , still looking away , " You wo n't find this in the Scriptures . Put your ear to the ground and you hear what the official account leaves out . The dirt knows its own . " " Yes ? " Lucius said . " Rumor has it that Adam did not leave the garden empty-handed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say  --  fig leaf . " He took a little of the dirt with him . " " The dirt ? " " The dirt of paradise . " Jack swung his head in a kind of angry despair . " If only he had said  --  The sweat is not bitter that earns the bread of life , and walked out upright , like a man . " " You forget the flaming sword . " " I forget nothing . " And now he looked directly towardsp223Lucius . " The winds blew it . It was only a handful . It was enough to blind all the generations of man . " The moon went under and Jack 's face swam away , but his voice went on , " I 've gone a roundabout way , but always you end up at home . Your Uncle Beverly said  --  I wo n't tread the mill of this world . I 'll live with the beasts . I 'll begin at the beginning and know the pure image of divinity imprisoned in the darkness of nature . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only feel that total innocence of love before carnal knowledge . When they were young , he and your mother had no love but for each other , and for one to think was for the other to act . It was the pure fire that does not burn . But the garden they wandered was never there . The world was though . It destroyed my brothers , your uncles . They tried , but the dust that never settles got in their eyes too . " " Mama , " Lucius almost cried . " What are you telling me ? " " Whatever the truth , put your eyes to it . Be like that Indian boy . Do n't shut them , whatever it is you have to see . " The roll of wheels , the soft crunch of hooves filled the silence pulsing between them , as Jack almost whispering , " For no matter how much sweat wets the common dirt , never will it fashion ... " " Fashion what , Uncle Jack ? " Lucius was leaning forward and whispering , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barouche ? " Jack asked sharply . The changed tone brought Lucius up , but he repeated , " Never what ? " But Jack 's attention was now all for the vehicle , slowing before the horse block . Before the driver could draw in the reins , a man stepped lightly out of the back seat , into the drive . He paused before the columned verandah ; then with the firm unconscious stride of the man who possesses what he sees walked up the steps towards the entrance doors . " That 's Mister Pete Legrand , " Lucius said with surprise . " Yes . And the barouche is Squire Drumgoole 's , " Jack replied . " Or was . "  | " What 's he doing . . . ? " " Oh , the honeycomb of paradise . The bitter bitter sweat . " Jack turned ; put his hands on Lucius 's shoulders and shook them lightly . " You go in to your mother , " he said . " And you ? " Lucius asked , and in his voice showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not until Jack had disappeared , not wandering away as he had come into the garden , but with that long sloping stride moving towards the house , not until then did Lucius suffer the full measure of shame . Oh , his Uncle Jack had seen him run like a puling child to his mother . No wonder that long indirect way of telling him to be a man . Not to blink at the truth . And then his shame gave before that subtle sense of betrayal which a lack of understanding on the part of those we love always leaves to work its hurt . Jack should have known he had just given under the shock of grief , and that he would face up to whatever it was he had to face . His father 's death had deprived him of his father 's presence , but not of his love for him . But Jack 's doubts in a way had deprived him of himself , for if you ca n't be understood , how can you be known ? Then how can love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumping into each other , smiling , caressing , frowning , alone in our incapacity to impart what we are , and share it , and so grow strong in this sharing ? He knew what the truth was . They were ruined . The farm and everything they owned would go under the hammer . His father had failed in his gamble . That was the meaning of Mr. Legrand 's appearance here , to see what he would buy in , to see if it was a bargain . Squire Drumgoole 's barouche was the sign . Did Jack think he 'd missed the point of that , too ? Go in to your mother . . . He breathed deep , he sighed in a swelling sadness , to think how much knowledge he had to bear , how little Jack understood . It seemed now that Jack was boy and he the man . If his uncle knew what the full truth really was ! And Lucius held his breath until his chest swelled , until the pain throbbed black behind hisp225eyes , bulging them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stale , and his strength ran down his legs like trembling water . His papa wanted the tree to fall on him . He had faced up to that at last . Now and here . With sweet bitterness he said it again , " Papa killed himself over me . " Everything between them had changed after he had gone to town to take up one of the notes , at the bank , or was it the last note to Aunt Amelie . It must have been she . His father would have been anxious to clear his indebtedness to her first . Maybe he went up knowing he would need more time and she had refused it . And as he saw he would lose his gamble , he saw further . He had risked everything for him , Lucius , and something had made him decide his son was not worthy . That was bound to be it . He was not a man to kill himself because he had lost . He could not do it for a loss , great as it was ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him with such strange intensity , as if he had to probe to his very center , to see his son for what he was , to find there the Lucius he had once thought worthy . Another time he had surprised his father , and they both looked away quickly , in embarrassment . After that the strain , the remoteness , grew between them . If only he had gone to him , said  --  Papa , what 's the matter ? For his father was too proud to bring it up himself . A father hates to tell his son he has failed . Oh , he saw it all now . His father was waiting for him to understand , to read his mind , to come out with it  --  What does it matter ? We 'll do it some other way . Yes , he saw it all . His father had felt the same betrayal Jack had just made him feel . How frivolous he must have seemed , how callous to the unspoken shades of feeling , when he asked permission to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to witch a well . To go for a week in the woods , pleasure bent , and leave his father alone with his travail.  --  Who will keep tab on Schott ? his father had asked , and there was no smile on his face . That was the appeal , and he had pretended to himself it was a teasing way of givingp226permission . He knew there was no smile . If only his father had said  --  No , I need you here . That would have broken the tension between them . For he was not going to the Peaks altogether for fun . He was running away from the strangeness , almost a denial he felt , a denial on the part of both of them . He could see it now , always you see too late , maybe . He was not only running away from , but running to somethingof his own ; and he felt again that fresh surge of body and being he had felt at day dawn , in the tight hot loft room at the tollgate . Had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disowning of what they had been to each other ? and then abruptly , as if it had been droppedThe low burst of laughter and the boy and girl plunged around the myrtle hedge ; and yet so quick did they recoil they barely touched him . The moon was high and bright , and so they knew him at once . It was Conrad and Lucy . Their laughter faded as a light dims , and quietly Lucy freed her hand . She straightened her dress , dropping her eyes to the movement of her hands . Conrad was more awkward . His face took on an unnatural pious look , but not his body . The violent motion he had brought with him into the garden charged it in its stillness , as if waiting upon his stupid face . " Sorry , Lucius , " he mumbled , and Lucius 's heart went out to them , to be with them . He remembered nothing of what he had been thinking , only feeling the ache of being set apart from what they had brought with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him off from them . So he hid his longing by a frown and nodded gravely . They waited respectfully before this composure of great sorrow . Conrad looked down and dug his toe in the path . It seemed the three of them could find no way to break apart , when Lucy said with formality , " We are sorry about your papa , " and Conrad eagerly , too eagerly , " Yes , Lucius , old fellow . " Lucius nodded as solemnly as he could , as if it were too much for speech . He felt very old and remote from them now . He turned away , leaving them to marvel at his stern grief . He walked slowly around the myrtle and stopped . Impulsively he bent his ear intop227its rough foliage . Behind it their feet crunched the gravel of the path ; then silence , and at a distance the drift of laughter low and intimate . . . suddenly the laughter muffled itself ; the soundless night descended upon the garden . The stems of myrtle sprigged his neck ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear , and he jerked back and rubbed it . Oh , they were not thinking of him . He had been a momentary obstacle forgotten as their feet , padding night 's old prowl , wanderedfurther into cover , back where the great trees defined the garden 's limits , sap , leaf , and bark dissolved into monstrous shadows , hovering . It was only last night , it seemed strange that it could have been only last night that he and Ada Belle had been drawn together by laughter too , as they fled the irate relief in Jack 's voice , into the sweet night air after the vomit stench of the room , holding hands , leaping together from the dog-run and , still laughing , their heads together , hair touching , tingling , they reached the edge of the yard . To be stopped only by the solid look of the woods . They could still hear Jack 's voice raised in mocking choler ; they hesitated ; they strained to listen , as if they could not bear to miss a word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how forced his giggling . And she  --  Snake bit . But there was no more laughter in them . He did not know his voice , looking not at her but into the lighter cleavage of darkness which the path made in the trees .  --  Where 's that go ? he asked . She turned and they walked in without speaking . She withdrew her hand and stepped ahead . He noticed the heavy beat in his throat and ears did not keep time with his steps . Once the tree tops opened up and the moon spilled down the trunks like wet whitewash . The wind puffed ; the ground wavered . He came up beside her and put his arm boldly about her waist . Still without saying anything , she took it away ; and then they were in the shades of night again . She led the way , and he followed . It seemed no time at all as the woods thinned and the wan light writhed among the branches or lay like smears of paste on the dark ground , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to him that there is no time if there is no thought , and his mind was as empty as a dry well . That was all he knew until they were standing in the expanse of the moon 's full quarter , upon a flat rock , looking down upon the narrow cut of a cove . He moved against her . She did not respond , but stood there quietly . Could this be the girl who had been so bold , suggestive , he 'd even thought so common . But gay in her rough talk as they played the farce of snake and hen . She raised her hand , pointing to the distant ridge  --  Yonder way lies Parcher 's Cove . The ridge lay in the distance and yet seemed near , a blue-black mass where the sky came down , so that it seemed to Lucius they stood in the center of a cave , and that the light both hid and disclosedthe multiplicity of things , where all that was separate , all that was individual , trees , rocks , earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together into one common reflection of  --  what ? He could not say , could only feel this . He looked out upon the mystery and then down upon the girl . No wonder they said the moon bewitched . She seemed no kin to Ada Rutter now , no kin to herself , the girl who had leaped off the dog-run to come here with him . Her calico garment had turned some dark rich stuff , a deeper blend of open neck and face . He looked hard at the purity of her features , leaned towards the lips no longer stained by snuff . The parted mouth now stained her face . She said  --  A man taken to the cove to live with the beasts , a time ago . This brought him up .  --  Yes , I know . It was my Uncle Beverly . His words seemed remote , unreal . He had the odd feeling that it had not yet happened .  --  He and another uncle died there during the war . The words made a blurred sound . Her face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this wonder ; felt the warmth of her body mingle with the warmth from his , while all about the night chill pressed them together . He lifted his arms , but she slipped away and was walking from him . She walked with a sinuous grace and lightness , as if the rock she trod , reamed by the famished moon , flowed only with night 's vapor , and the sky was her journeyingplace . At the edge she dropped , and his heart stopped a beat  |p229And  then he saw she had not fallen ; she had paused upon some step of air , half in darkness , half in the dissolving light . Her face lay back upon her hair , and the hair floated as fierce as a tiny rain cloud . She arched her neck to the milky light . A shadow slit it like a knife .  --  Jump down , she said . He jumped into the pit beside her . She steadied him with her hand . With their backs to the curving rock wall they edged their way along the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she sprang across . He looked once into the abyss and , holding his breath , leaped beside her . He felt the moss give and gazed to see where they were . They had come to a secret place , a kind of shelf in the wall . The ceiling and floor gaped like an open mouth . Its breath was chill ; yet the mossy floor reached outwards for the light in a rounded jagged lip . To this they moved . They stood upon it as upon a wafer poised in the deeps of space , while up the cove the moon water rolled and spilled . They sank under it as one body into the giving moss . Languidly their arms and legs entwined . Their mouths pressed together for mortal breath ; their teeth jarred , parted before the flickering softness , the tentative pressure of the probing tongue . Their bodies touched with the violence of some ancient wound at last embalmed . And then from below he could feel the old intruder raise his head and drive the wedge between them . Trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For an instant he sought her eyes ; he dropped them to what his hand was doing . She wore , he saw in momentary surprise , no drawers . Still but watchful , the dress rumpled below her breast , she lay in all the disarray of a wounded bird . Her legs were pressed together as if she were holding a coin between her thighs . Head bent over and down , he waited in the moon 's blind ( low until , swept before the mounting surge , he drove his knee clumsily between the giving thighs . The girl 's hand reached for and clasped the blood 's true shape . He remembered now his shame and disgust . His father had known . He would have run to him and confessed , begged forgiveness . It was too late . He heard the girl quietly sobbing and feltp230only loathing for her tears . He crawled into the darkness of the shelf . When he opened his eyes , the moon had moved down the arc of the sky . The approach of day had thinned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the girl was warm against him and asleep , her arm flung across his chest , he relaxed now and stilled , as if listening to the world 's body dreaming its myriad reflection ; but the tireless blood deep in his flesh , whose channels neither the sun nor the moon may reach , the images of dream quickened . He turned to the girl and pulled her closer , and in a waking sleep she drew him down ; down into darkness . . . Along the horizon a thin streak of color smeared the counterfeit sky . From pole to pole time was spreading its old dividers . Hastily he stood up . " Come on , " he said . " We 've got to go . " He led the way , nor did he look behind him . Once back upon the outjutting flat rock he paused . He scanned the glistening trees , shifting , resuming their shapes . She came up beside him . Any moment now , at their backs , the flaming darts would stream upon the eastern border . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them he would find the path . Peter Legrand found the hall empty . He could not have hoped for such luck . He strode past the sitting room on the long chance she would not be there  --  it was too full of women ; he saw them whispering with too little restraint  --  to the room behind and , withoutknocking , turned the knob and entered . At first he thought it was empty . A lamp on the washstand was turned low ; all the light came from the east window . It reached halfway into the room ; it stretched the crocheted counterpane until it seemed nailed to the bed . His glance paused there ; it was this chill guest-bed look which made the room seem not only empty but abandoned . And then he heard it , a sigh . It was drawn from the very depths of the spirit ; it broke off into a moan which could not ease . His impulse was to leave , hearing what no ear was meant to hear ; but he had seen her . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a solid shadow isolated by the broken light the moon gave ,  |p231As  he watched her , he knew there could be no turning back . He would act upon that instinct of decision which had brought him so rudely into her presence . The elation of desire sinking into pity scattered all his plans . Impulsively he took a step towards her , but the loud creak of his boots restored him to his senses . Carefully he collected himself upon the poignant grace of her figure  --  if only she would turn her eyes . " Julia , " he whispered . It seemed louder than a shout , but she did not respond . He said in a normal speaking voice , " Miss Julia . " The shadow stirred ; he sensed the motion as the hand reached her breast , saw the moment of hesitancy , all its courage , before she turned . " Who are you ? " Her voice was harsh . " What are you doing in my chamber ? " " To offer help . " But she was crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning up the lamp wick . Can an oily wick show so much pallor ? He was very still . He felt if he loosed his gaze , she would fall . At last she spoke . " Mr. Legrand , you will find the men across the hall . " " No , " he said at last . " You must let me say what I have come to say . " He had calculated as never before the hour of his arrival . He had gambled on that empty pause , after shock and grief , that comes inevitably upon the sense of relief when the body is washed and dressed and the coffin lid down , the relief of acceptance of what has happened . But most of all he knew the mind will not remain empty . Most of all he had counted on this . " This is hardly the time for business , " she said . Her self-possessionwas now entirely restored . " Whatever business you had with my husband . . . " " My business is with you , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held it for her . He had put into his step the firmness of purpose ; he now said , " Wo n't you sit down ? " Shep232made no move ; her regard was cool and distant . " After all , we have not always been strangers . There was a time ... " " Mr. Legrand , " she interrupted . " If we have seemed strangers these nineteen years ... " " Mr. Legrand , we are strangers . And you are in my private chamber . Will you please retire ? " " Miss Julia , I hold myself responsible for my acts . I have come to claim this right of responsibility . " " Sir , you have no claims upon me . Certainly , " and he saw the barest rise of the shoulders , or was it a flutter of the neck ? Was his sight so strained it made of these his hope ? " Certainly , " she repeated , " I have no claim upon you . " " But you have a son , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A son who will be without inheritance . " " How , sir , can that be of interest to you ? " Her voice had dropped its cool indifference . With a fierce uplifting swell in his chest , he saw he might proceed . Scarcely knowing he did it , he walked directly to her and took her hand . " You will be more comfortable seated , " he said ; and when she made some slight resistance , he raised his voice . " Please allow me . It will not take long , what I have to say . " He found for himself an upright chair . He stood behind it and grasped its back . This steadied him , to put a physical object between them . " What interests me most , " he said , " and has increased my wonder with each passing year , is that a marriage of so many years has brought forth only one child . " " You wonder at God 's mystery ? " Her tone was almost conversational ; he could not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wonder that you find it mysterious . " " And I , " she said " And you , " he replied " I find it hard to believe you could waste your time on so unprofitable a speculation . "  | " Ah , " he said . " That strikes home . I know my reputation . I had hoped from you a clearer understanding . " " From me you had hope ? " " Hope may take strange disguises . " He opened and clasped his hands on the firm wood rungs . " What is it you want of me , Mr. Legrand ? " The shift of tone made him shift the direction of his appeal . " I want you to allow me to save Joe Cree 's estate . " She gave no immediate response to this but in the dim light seemed to study him . How still their bodies were , what a violent passage their eyes made crossing , as each searching disclosed only the other 's search . At last she looked away . " We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I well know your brothers , " he said . He was surprised at the bitterness of his tone , but was given no time for surprise . He saw she was about to rise ; he said rapidly , " Yes , I know you will have shelter , and food there . I know Jack 's property is unencumbered . But remember . It will be your home , but not your house . For Lucius it will not be home at all . He will learn to breed mules if , " and here he paused , " if he stays . " As if his words were pellets striking her , she turned her head . He continued , with increasing confidence , " I am a rich man . I am envied , but I am respected . I have the reputation of driving hard trades . I drive no trades . I pay the price a thing is worth . Worth has the most shifting and varied of contents , and I know that brother or no brother , if you go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so will Lucius . " She half rose in her chair . " Please , " he said . " Of course there will be nothing obvious . But suppose he fills the front parlor with cotton , as he has this season ? Will you protest ? You may , but how can you answer when he says it 's fixing up to rain and he ca n't afford to ruin the cotton ? The obvious answer is to build a cotton house , but once the bales are ginned , do you think he will get around to it ? Suppose he wants to drink . Will you stop him ? You may , but will he thank youp234for it ? I am offering you your own establishment . I am offering Lucius a chance to earn his inheritance . " He stopped and looked at her ; at her alert widened stare , open upon the brutal reasoning he had put before her ; and with relief he saw she had followed him , had followed so fast she was left no time to question his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " You are a sensible woman . You were sensible even as a girl . You took the advice of your brothers at another time of crisis . Now take mine . " " What , " and her voice was level , although any moment her rising breast must shake it , " what is your price ? " He replied in his most businesslike voice . " In two weeks you have a note of six thousand dollars to fall due . I will pay that . In return you will deed to me your share in the turnpike . It is worth a thousand dollars a mile . I am buying it a little above its present worth . And then I will go your note for the rest , and believe me your obligations are large . You will not under the present managementof this farm be able to take up your debts and the notes Joe Cree stood for . But I have a plan that ought to work . " He paused and his look was a demand . She dropped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your price ? " " Ah , " he said . " My price ? " " Yes ? " Her voice was barely audible . " It is that you will let me advise you . " " Yes ? " " So that , " his own voice was no longer firm , " I may become friends with  --  with Lucius . " And as she remained silent , her head lifted at this but the eyes still veiled , he felt the enormity of his daring . He had staked all his hope , and with fright understood himself , that he had relied upon his riches and that they would be nothing before her refusal . And she was capable of refusal . Why had n't he , who had waited so long , waited a little longer , until after the funeral , until the note actually fell due , he who in affairs timed so exactly his moves ? Out of his selfish need , thinking only of that , he had thrust himselfp235upon her , at her time of sorrow and confusion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated the dead , not yet buried . He had rushed in to violate her memory of the dead . Nineteen years she had lived with Joe Cree , and all those years now , in her hesitation , seemed an eternity of intimacy , endearment , habit . He felt sick , empty . If she should refuse . . . desperately he sought within his being for some footing .. . She rose suddenly and clasped her hands , then slowly paced the carpet . He almost hated her grace . She said , " I knew I had heard a ghost . " He heard his voice break , a thing so strange . " Forgive me . This is ill timed . I 'll go . " He could not see her surprise , for his sight was blurred . Before he could take in what had happened to him , even begin to think how he would respond , there was a knock on the door into the hall . It was a firm but careful knock . She said , " You had better compose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and started towards the window . " No , " she said . " Do n't turn your back . Sit down . " He felt he was losing control of the situation . For so long he had ruled his feelings he had thought the rigidity was all himself ; and now , the unexpected , like a sudden wind rising on a still day , had caught him up , lifted and churned him about by a force long submerged which , since forgotten , he recognized with all the fresh renewal of the lost restored . He drew himself erect in the chair ; he felt the severity of his glance , how frail a defense it was ; but he also felt a sharpening of his awareness , as if his senses had been honed . He heard her voice say , " Come in , " as the door swung open . It presented Rhears bearing a tray with a glass of buttermilk and a plate of rolls . The room grew suddenly small . The tray seemed a toy in his hands . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you might want a little something . " Rhears had seen him at once , but like a good servant had showed no surprise , merely pausing to look to Julia for direction , and his white coat made the black face shine with lustrous depths.  |p236She  said , " Set it on the bedside table . " Of course he knew Rhears as he knew everybody in this part of the county worth knowing . He had noted particularly the efficiency with which he oversaw the gravel hauled to the pike ; but now , close up , his worth showed in all its entirety . He took in the reserve and poise of his carriage as resting on far more than a good servant 's training . Nor was it the self-confidence of physical strength , although Rhears knew his strength . He had seen powerful men ill at ease inside a house . Rhears would be ill at ease nowhere . His hands were not made for such trifles as trays , and yet this trifle enhanced his dignity . And then it came to him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its proper worth , for he was a devoted man . And his devotion was to the Cree establishment . To him the house and lands must represent the permanence of things and his own self-esteem throve on maintaining , within the confines of his place in it , this order . It would not occur to him that it could be shaken , any more than that Julia 's judgment or directions could be doubted . Julia had recognized his knock , and that knock as well as his presence here , now , showed all the familiarity of habit , the small acts which succeed each other , repeat themselves , and as the seasons turn make up the illusion of a stable world . He sensed how , coming at this moment , Rhears would do more for his plea than any argument he could make . He saw it in the reflective look she cast upon her servant , now turning away from the table where he had set the tray . He was the concrete sign of unbelief in disaster to the Cree farm . His very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let the farm go under the hammer . Rhears waited for her to speak , but she was lost in her reflections . He waited just the proper time , not correcting her lapse , but ignoring it as if she had already spoken . He said , " What shall I put on Mr. Legrand 's tray ? " She recovered herself at his words and turned . Pete Legrand shook his head . " Are you sure ? " " I would take a glass of that buttermilk. "  |p237Rhears  gave a bare nod and regarding his mistress , " Miss Julia , we out of whiskey . " She fumbled for her keys . " Here , " she said . " But I 'd take the decanters to the storeroom and fill them there . Yourself , " and she looked at him . " Yes , ma 'm . I understand . " " And you might bring that card table out of the hall . We can eat on that . And a small dish of pigs ' feet . " He bowed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held it while he brought the table in , lifted the dropped leaf and turned the top until it rested solid upon its base . Neither of them spoke during the interval he was gone . Without apology they kept their silence . It would give her time to think and him time to arrange without haste the details of what he would propose . She must no longer depend upon cotton so much ; put more land down in wheat and oats ; fence it better ; increase her sheep ; and he would furnish the cattle for grazing and the corn and hay he would buy in Missouri , and they would share the profits of increase . He would buy sound but thin cattle which the drought would throw on the market . Her back woods , fenced , would hold fifty sows . It would serve for a plan . It was sensible enough to give him time . She would persuade herself it would work because she would want it to work , and then . . . his heart gave a throb and he moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long to return with the other tray , with delicacies besides pigs ' feet . The soft noises he made arranging the table increased the silence ; and when he left , they sat down , still without speaking , and he drank the thick tart milk , spring-cooled , flecks of yellow butter floating on top . But they did not eat . At last without constraint , as if they had met by arrangement for the matter before them , she leaned slightly forward . " And now , " she said . " You have a plan . " Jack Cropleigh reached the drive as the carriage turned the corner of the house on its way to the back . This meant that **27;10332;TOOLONG for at least another half hour , and it was pleasant to be among them in the windless , cold night air . The lights of the restaurant across the street were warm among the dark buildings , and the doorman , while not effusive , was agreeablypolite as he swung the door open for them . The headwaiterwas a little chillier than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although there were several empty tables closer to the entrance . Robert humbly accepted the table , thinking philosophically , Well , this is a theatrical restaurant ; there are dozens of places where they 'd put me near the front of the room and actors 'd be lucky to get through the door . Virginia settled herself on the banquette with a hundred small subsiding movements , then took out her glasses and carefully surveyed the room . After a minute , she put the glasses down on the table and turned toward Robert . " What 're you smiling at ? " she asked . " Because you 're so pleased , " said Robert . " Who says I 'm pleased ? " " You examined the terrain and you said to yourself , Is n't this nice ? I 'm prettier than any of them , ' and now you can enjoy your supper . " " Oh , you 're so sharp , " Virginia said . She smiled , " You 're such a sharp man . " The waiter came , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the restaurant fill up with people who had been to the theatre and actors who still had traces of greasepaint around their collars and tall , astonishing-looking girls in mink coats from the musicals across the street . Robert ate hungrily and drank his wine slowly , nursing it.  | " That play tonight , " Virginia was saying , delicately winding spaghetti on her fork against a spoon , " was all right and I enjoyed it while I was there , but I 'm getting tired of how awful all the female characters are in plays these days . All the women always are drunks or nymphomaniacsor they drive their sons crazy or they ruin the lives of two or three people an act . If I were a playwright , I 'd write a nice , old-fashioned play in which the heroine is pure and beautiful and makes a man out of her husband , even though he 's weak and drinks too much and occasionallyrobs his boss to bet on the horses . " " If you were a playwright , you 'd be in Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'd be a big success , " Virginia insisted . " I bet people are just dying to go to see a play that they can come out of and say , Yes , that 's just how Mother was the time Dad had his trouble down at the bank and those two men in plainclothes came to see him from New York . ' " " If anything like that comes up , " Robert said comfortably , " you go to see it some matinee . By yourself . " " And all the actresses these days . They try to act so ordinary . Just like anybody you 'd meet in the street . Sometimesyou wonder how they dare charge you admission to watch them . When I was a little girl , actresses used to be so affected you 'd know you had to pay to see them , because you 'd never meet anybody like that in real life in a million years . " " How did you like Duse ? " Robert asked . " What did you think of Bernhardt when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know what I mean . That girl you liked so much tonight , for example . . . " " Which girl I liked so much ? " Robert asked , puzzled.  | " The big one . The one that played the friend . " " Oh , that one , " Robert said . " I did n't like her so much . " " You certainly sounded as though you did . I thoughtyour hands 'd be a bloody pulp by the time she got off thestage . " " I was just being neighborly , " Robert said . " I met her once at a party . " " Whose party ? " Virginia stopped eating . " The Lawtons ' . She went to school with Anne Lawton , " Robert said . " Did n't you meet her ? " " I did n't go to that party . I had the flu that week . " Virginia sipped her wine . " What 's her name ? " " Carol Something . Look at the program . " " I left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Robert shrugged . " I only talked to her for five minutes . She told me she came from California and she hates working for television and she was divorced last year but they 're still good friends . The usual kind of talk you get at the Lawtons ' . " " She looks as though she came from California , " Virginia said , making it sound like a criticism . " Oakland , " Robert said . " It 's not exactly the same thing . " " There she is now , " said Virginia . " Near the door . " Robert looked up . The girl was alone and was making her way down the center of the room . She was n't wearing a hat , and her hair looked careless , and she had on a shapelesspolo coat and flat shoes , and Robert decided , looking at her , that actresses were getting plainer every year . She stopped briefly once or twice to greet friends at other tables , then headed for a table in the corner , where a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Robertp53realized that she was going to pass their table , and wondered if he ought to greet her . The party at which they 'd met had been almost two months before , and he had a modest theory that people like actresses and book publishersand movie directors never remembered anyone they met who was n't in a related profession . He doubted whether the girl would recognize him , but he arranged a slight , impersonal smile on his face , so that if she did happen to remember , he would seem to be saluting her . If she just passed by , Robert hoped that it would merely look as though he were responding with polite amusement to one of Virginia 's remarks . But the girl stopped in front of the table , smiling widely . She put out her hand and said , " Why , Mr. Harvey , is n't it nice seeing you again ! " She was n't any prettier close up , Robert decided , but when she smiled , she seemed friendly and simple , and her voice sounded as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes in the noisy corner at the Lawtons ' two months ago . Robert stood up and took her hand . " Hello , " he said . " May I present my wife . Miss Byrne . " " How do you do , Miss Byrne , " Virginia said . " We were just talking about you . " " We saw your show tonight , " Robert said . " We thought you were very good indeed . " " Are n't you dear to say that , " the girl said . " I love to hear it , even if you do n't mean it at all . " " What about the man who wrote the play ? " Virginia asked . " He must be rather strange . " " Mother trouble . " Miss Byrne glanced significantly up at the ceiling . " All the young writers coming into the theater these days seem to have the same thing . You'dp54think it 'd be the war that would be haunting them , but it is n't at all . It 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers , " she said . " Is this your first play , Miss Byrne ? " " Heavens , no , " the girl said . " I 've been in three others . Regret , The Six-Week Vacation . . . . I do n't even remember the name of the third one . Turkeys . Here today and closed by Saturday . " Virginia turned to Robert . " Did you happen to see any of them , dear ? " she asked . " No , " Robert said , surprised . He never went to the theatre without Virginia . " Three other plays , " Virginia went on pleasantly , soundinggenuinely interested . " You must have been in New York quite a long time . " " Two years , " Miss Byrne said . " A single blink of the eye of a drama critic . " " Two years , " Virginia said , politely . She turned to Robert again . " Where did you say Miss Byrne came from ? Hollywood ? " " Oakland , " Robert said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After Oakland . " " I love it , " Miss Byrne said , sounding young and enthusiastic . " Even with the flops . " " I 'm so sorry , " Virginia said . " Keeping you standing there like that , talking on and on about the theatre . Would n't you like to sit down and join us for a drink ? " " Thanks , " the girl said , " I really ca n't . They 're waiting for me over in the corner . " " Some other time , perhaps , " Virginia said . " I 'd love it , " said Miss Byrne . " It 's been fun meetingp55you , Mrs. Harvey . Mr. Harvey told me about you . I do hope we see each other again . Good night . " She waved and smiled widely again and strode over toward her waiting friends . Robert sat down slowly . There was silence at the table for a moment . " It 's a hard life , " Virginia said after a while , " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The Six-Week Vacation , " Virginia said . " No wonder it failed , with a title like that . Did she play the lead in it , that girl ? " " I do n't know , " Robert said , waiting . " I told you I did n't see it . " " That 's right , " Virginia said . " You told me . " They were silent again . Virginia began to twist the stem of her wineglass with little , jerky movements . " You told me , " she repeated . " It 's too bad she could n't have a drink with us . We might have learned a great deal about the theatre tonight . I find people in the theatre so fascinating . Do n't you ? " " What 's the matter with you ? " Robert asked . " Nothing , " Virginia said flatly . " There 's nothing the matter with me at all . Are you finished with your food ? " " Yes . " " Let 's pay the check and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Robert said , drawling the name out complainingly . " Rah-ahbert ... " Virginia said , mimicking him . " All right , " said Robert . " What is it ? " " I said nothing . "  | " I know what you said . What is it ? " Virginia lifted her eyes and looked at him closely . " Miss Byrne , " she said . " I thought you did n't know her name . " " Oh , " Robert said . " Now it 's turning into one of those evenings . " " It 's not turning into any kind of evening . Get the check , " Virginia said . " I want to go home . " " Waiter ! " Robert called . " The check , please . " He stared at Virginia . She was beginning to look martyred . " Listen , " Robert said . " I did n't know her name . " " Carol Something , " said Virginia . " It came to me just as she got to the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever happened to you ? " " No , " said Virginia . " Well , it 's a common phenomenon . " Virginia nodded . " Very common , " she said , " I 'm sure . " " Do n't you believe me ? " " You have n't forgotten a girl 's name since you were six years old , " Virginia said . " You remember the name of the girl you danced with once the night of the Yale game in 1935 . " " Gladys , " Robert said . " Gladys McCreary . She played field hockey for Bryn Mawr . " " No wonder you were so eager to get to the Lawtons ' that night . " " I was n't eager to get to the Lawtons ' that night , " Robert said , his voice beginning to rise . " And anyway I did n't even know she existed . At least be logical . " " I had a hundred and three fever , " Virginia said , pitying herself all over again for the damp eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier . " I was just lying there all alone , day after day ... "  | " Do n't make it sound as though you were on the point of death for the whole winter , " Robert said loudly . " You were in bed three days , and on Saturday you went to lunch in a snowstorm . " " Oh , " Virginia said , " you can remember that it snowed one Saturday two months ago , but you ca n't remember the name of a girl you talked to for hours at a party , that you exchanged the most intimate confidences with . " " Virginia , " Robert said , " I 'm going to get up on this seat and scream at the top of my voice . " " Divorced , she said , but they 're still good friends . I 'll bet they are . I 'll bet that girl is good friends with a lot of people . How about you and your ex-wife ? " Virginia demanded . " Are you good friends with her , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Robert said , " that the only time I see my ex-wife is when she wants the alimony ad-justed . " " If you keep talking in that tone of voice , they 'll never let you in this restaurant again , " Virginia whispered . " Let 's get out of here , " Robert said blindly . " Waiter , where 's that check ? " " She 's thick . " Virginia stared at Miss Byrne , who was sitting with her back to them twenty feet away , talking brightly and waving a cigarette . " Through the middle . Grotesquely thick . " " Grotesquely , " Robert agreed . " You do n't fool me , " Virginia said , " I know your tastes . " " Oh , God , " Robert murmured . " Always pretending to be such a connoisseur of beautiful women , " Virginia said , " and secretly what you really like are old-fashioned , disgusting brood mares . " " Oh , God , " Robert said again.  | " Like that Elise Cross , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cape . She always looked as though she had to be packed into her girdle under pressure . And whenever I looked around for you at a party , you both were gone , out on the dunes . " " I thought we had agreed never to discuss that subject again , " Robert said with dignity . " What subject am I permitted to discuss ? " Virginia demanded . " The United Nations ? " " There never was anything between me and Elise Cross . Not anything . And you know it , " Robert said firmly and convincingly . It was true that there had been something , but that had been two years ago , and he had n't seen Elise Cross since then , or anyone else , for that matter . And anywayit had been summertime then , and he had been drunk a good deal of the time for a reason he could no longer recall , and the people around them had been of that peculiar , handsome , neurotic , wife-changing type that appearsat places like that in August and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Labor Day and had resolved to change his ways once and for all . Now he felt blameless and aggrieved at being called upon to defend himself after all that abstinence . " You spent more time on the beach than the Coast Guard , " Virginia said . " If the waiter does n't come with the check , " Robert said , " I 'm going to walk out of here and they can follow me in a taxi if they want their money . " " I should have known , " Virginia said , and there was a remote throb in her voice . " People told me about you before we were married . I knew your reputation . " " Look , that was more than five years ago , " Robert saidp59doggedly . " I was younger then and more energetic and I was married to a woman I did n't like and who did n't like me . I was unhappy and lonely and restless  --  " " And now ? " " And now , " Robert said , thinking how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his wife for six or seven months , " and now I am married to a woman I love and I am settled and profoundly happy . I have n't had lunch or a drink with anyone for years . I barely tip my hat to women I know when I pass them in the street . " " And what about that fat actress over there ? " " Look , " Robert said , feeling hoarse , as though he had been shouting into the wind for hours . " Let 's get it straight . I met her at a party . I spoke to her for five minutes . I do n't think she 's very pretty . I do n't think she 's much as an actress . I was surprised when she recognized me . I forgot her name . Then I remembered her name when she came to the table . " " I suppose you expect me to believe that . " Virginia smiled coldly . " I certainly do . Because it 's an exact statement of fact . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't think I did n't . " " What smile ? " Robert asked , honestly puzzled . " Why , Mr. Harvey , " Virginia said , cooing , " is n't it nice seeing you again ? And then the teeth and the girlish crinkling of the nose and the long , direct stare ... " " Finally , " Robert said to the waiter , who was leaning over the table , putting the check down . " Do n't go away . " Robert counted out some bills , feeling his hands shaking minutely with rage . He watched the waiter going toward the cashier 's desk , near the kitchen , for change . Then he spoke , trying to keep his voice under control . " Now , " hep60said , turning back to Virginia , " what , exactly , did you mean by that ? " " I may not be very smart , " Virginia said , " but if there 's one thing I have , it 's intuition . Especially where you 're concerned . And anyway that smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Robert felt his fists opening and closing spasmodically . " It 's charming of you to think , even after being married to me for five years , that women just drop at my feet after speaking to me for five minutes , but I have to disillusion you . It has never happened to me . Never , " he said slowly and distinctly and with some disappointment . " If there 's one thing I ca n't stand , it 's fake modesty , " Virginia said . " I 've seen you looking at yourself in the mirror , approving of yourself by the hour , pretending you were shaving or looking for gray hairs . And , " she added bitterly , " I 've talked to your mother . I know how she brought you up . Drilling it into your head that the whole panting female sex was after you because you were a Harvey and you were so dazzling  --  " " Good God , " Robert said . " Now we have my mother , too . " " She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " your mother . Do n't think she has n't . " " All right , " Robert said . " My mother is a low , terrible woman and everybody agrees on that . But what has that got to do with the fact that a woman I met at a party happened to smile at me ? " " Happened , " Virginia said . " I still do n't see how it could be my fault , " Robert said , trying to sound patient . " I ca n't control the way people smile in restaurants . "  | " It 's always your fault , " Virginia said . " Even if you do n't say a word . It 's just the way you come into the room and stand there and decide to look . . . male . " Robert jumped up , pushing the table back . " I ca n't stand it , " he said . " I ca n't stand it any more . The hell with the change . " Virginia stood up , too , her face rigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he helped her on with her coat . " Let 's you and I not talk to each other for a week . " " Fine , " said Virginia crazily . " That 's perfectly fine with me . " She walked swiftly toward the door , through the middle of the restaurant , without looking back . Robert watched her striding down the narrow aisle between the tables , her black coat floating behind her . He wished that he had a worse temper . He wished that he had a temper so bad that he could stay out all night and get drunk . The waiter came with the change , and Robert fumbled with the tip . Over the waiter 's shoulder he saw Miss Byrne swing her head slowly toward him . Everybody else at her table was talking animatedly . For the first time , Robert looked at her carefully . It is true , he thought numbly . Most women these days are too damn thin . Then Miss Byrne smiled at him . Her nose crinkled and her teeth showed and she seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt flattered and considerably younger and very curious . And as he dropped his eyes and left a large tip for the waiter , he knew , helplessly , that he was going to call her next day and he knew what her voice was going to sound like on the telephone . Then he got his coat and hurried out of the restaurant after his wife.  |p62BEDDOES  GOT IN FROM EGYPT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MORNING . He went to his hotel and shook hands with the concierge and told him that the trip had been fine but that Egyptians were impossible . From the concierge he found out that the city was crowded , as usual , and that the price of the room had gone up once more , as usual . " The tourist season now lasts twelve months a year , " the concierge said , giving Beddoes his key . " Nobody stays home any more . It is exhausting . " Beddoes went upstairs and told the porter to put his typewriter in the closet , because he did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked out with pleasure at the Seine flowing past . Then he took a bath and put on fresh clothes and gave Christina 's number over the telephone to the woman at the switchboard . The woman at the switchboard had an insulting habit of repeatingnumbers in English , and Beddoes noticed , with a smile , that that had not changed . There was the familiar hysteria on the wires as the woman on the switchboard got Chris/tina 's number . The telephone in Christina 's hotel was down the hall from her room , and Beddoes had to spell the name slowly  --  Mlle. " T " for Theodore , " A " for Andre , " T " for Theodore , " E " for Edouard  --  before the man on the other end understood and went away to tell Christina an American gentleman demanded her on the telephone . Beddoes heard Christina 's footsteps coming down the hall toward the telephone and he thought he could tell from the sound that she was wearing high heels . " Hello , " Christina said . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but even so Beddoes could recognize the breathless , excited tone of her voice . Christinaanswered the phone as though she expected each call to be an invitation to a party . " Hi , Chris , " Beddoes said . " Who 's this ? " " The voice of Egypt , " said Beddoes . " Walter ! " Christina said happily . " When did you get in ? " " This minute , " Beddoes said , lying by an hour to please her . " Are you wearing high heels ? " " What ? " " You 're wearing high heels , are n't you ? " " Wait a minute while I look , " Christina said . Then , after a pause , " Did you turn psychic in Cairo ? " Beddoes chuckled . " Semi-Oriental fakery , " he said . " I brought back a supply . Where 're we going for lunch ? " " Walter ! " Christina said . " I 'm in despair . " " You have a date . " " Yes . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's O.K. , " Beddoes said carelessly . He made a point of never sounding disappointed . He had a feeling that if hep64asked Christina to break the date she would , but he also made a point of never pleading for anything . " We 'll make it later . " " How about a drink this afternoon ? " " We can start with that , " Beddoes said . " Five ? " " Make it five-thirty , " Christina said . " Where 're you going to be ? " Beddoes asked , minutely annoyed at the postponement . " Near the Etoile , " Christina said . " Alexandre 's ? " " Fine , " Christina said . " Will you be on time for once ? " " Be more polite , " Beddoes said , " the first day the man comes to town . " " A tout a l'heure , " Christina said . " What did you say , Ma'am ? " " All the kids are speaking French this year . " Christina laughed . " Is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a click as she hung up . Beddoes put the phone down slowly and went over to the window . He stared at the river , thinking that this was the first time in a long while that Christina had n't come over immediately when he arrived in Paris . The river appeared cold and the trees were bare and the sky looked as though it had been gray for months . But with all that , the city looked promising . Even the sunless , snowless winter weather could n't prevent Paris from looking promising . He had lunch with a man from the A.P . who had just come back from America . The man from the A.P . said that things were in unholy shape in America and that even if you ate in drugstores it cost at least a dollar and a half for lunch and Beddoes ought to be damned glad he was n't there.  |p65Beddoes  got to the cafe a little late , but Christina had n't arrived . He sat on the glass-enclosed terrace , next to the huge window , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The terrace was crowded with women drinking tea and men reading the evening newspapers . Outside , under the trees , a little parade was forming , the veterans of some World War I unit , huddling , middleaged , and chilled in their overcoats , with their flags and decorations , preparing to walk behind an Army band up to the Arch and put a wreath on the tomb in memory of comrades who had fallen in battles that no one any longer remembered . The French , Beddoes thought sourly , becauseChristina was late and the afternoon had failed its promise , are always finding occasions to block traffic . They have an endless supply of dead to celebrate . He ordered a beer , because he had drunk too much at lunch . He had also eaten too much , in the first wave of gluttony after Egyptian food . His stomach felt uncomfortable , and he was suddenly very tired from all the miles he had travelled in the past twenty-four hours . After the age of thirty-five , he thought , in evening melancholy , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how soft the cushion , the bones record the miles inexorably . He had turned thirty-five three months before and he had begun to reflect uneasily upon age . He stared at his face in mirrors , noticing wrinkles under his eyes and gray in his beard when he shaved . He remembered hearing that aging ballplayers shaved two and three times a day to keep managers and sportswriters from seeing the telltale flecks in beard stubble . Maybe , he thought , career men in the foreign service ought to do the same thing . Seventy minus thirty-five leaves thirty-five , he thought . It was an equationp66that came ominously to mind , especially late in the afternoon , more and more often after the midway anniversary . He stared out through the cold glass at the shuffling veterans , ranked shabbily behind their flags , their breath , mingled with cigarette smoke , rising in little clouds above their heads . He wished they 'd start marching and get away from there . " Veteran " was a word that suddenly fell on his ear with an unpleasant sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't like her to be late . She was one of those rare girls who always got to places exactly on the appointed hour . Irrelevantly , he remembered that she also dressed with great speed and took only a minute or two to comb her hair . She had blond hair , cut in the short Parisian manner , which left the back of her neck bare . Beddoes thought about the back of Christina 's neck and felt better . They would give themselves a gay evening , he thought . One should not permit himself to feel tired or old in Paris . If the feeling ever gets chronic , he told himself , I 'll move away for good . He thought about the evening ahead of him . They 'd wander around to a couple of bars , avoiding their friends and not drinking too much , and go to a bistro in the marketswhere there were thick steaks and a heavy red wine , and after that maybe they 'd go to the night club where there was a queer , original puppet show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike so many night-club songs , really did turn out to be funny . When you came out into the street after their act you were charmed and amused and you had the sense that this was the way a man should feel in Paris at two o'clock in the morning . The night before he left for Cairo , he had taken Christinathere . The prospect of going back on this first nightp67home gave him an unexplained but pleasant feeling of satisfactory design . Christina had looked very pretty , the prettiest girl in the room full of handsome women , he 'd thought , and he had even danced , for the first time in months . The music was supplied by a pianist and a man who got quivering , rich sounds from an electric guitar , and they played those popular French songs that always made you feel how sweet was love in the city , how full of sorrow and tempered regret . The music had made Christina a little moony , he remembered , which was strange for her , and she had held his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights went out between numbers . Her eyes had filled with tears for a moment and she had said , " What am I going to do without you for two months ? " when he spoke of his departure the next morning . He had felt , a little warily , because he was affected , too , that it was lucky he was leaving , if she was moving into that phase . That was the **29;10361;TOOLONG , and you had to be on guard against it , especially late at night , in Paris , in darkened rooms where pianists and electric guitars played songs about dead leaves and dead loves and lovers who were separated by wars . Beddoes had been married once , and he felt , for the time being , that that was enough . Wives had a tendency to produce children , and sulk and take to drink or other men when their husbands were called away to the other side of the earth for three or four months at a time on jobs . He had been a little surprised at Christina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , although until recently not very well , almost from the time she arrived from the States four years before . She did some modelling for photographers and was pretty enough to have done very well at it , except that , as she said , she felt too silly makingp68the fashionable languorous , sexy grimaces that were demandedof her . She knew how to type and take dictation and she found odd jobs with American businessmen who had work for a month or two at a time in Paris . She had picked up French immediately , and drove a car , and from time to time she got curious little jobs as a companion for old American ladies who wanted to tour through the chateaucountry or into Switzerland . She never seemed to need any sleep ( even now she was only about twenty-six ) and she would stay up all night with anybody and she went to all the parties and had had , to Beddoes ' knowledge , affairs with two friends of his  --  a free-lance photographer and an Air Transport Command pilot who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone her at any hour of the day or night without making her angry and you could introduce her into any group and be pleased with the way she behaved . She always knew which bistro was having a rage at the moment and who was singing at which night club and which new painter was worth seeing and who was in town and who was going to arrive next week and which little hotels outside Paris were pleasant for lunch or a weekend . She obviously did n't have much money , but she dressed charmingly , French enough to amuse her French friends and not so French that she made Americans feel she was trying to pretend she was European . All in all , while she was not a girl of whom your grandmother was likely to approve , she was , as Beddoes-had once told her , an ornament to the wandering and troubled years of the second half of the twentieth century . The veterans started to move off , the banners flapping a little in the dusk as the small parade turned past thep69TWA office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other parades , other banners . Then he saw Christina striding diagonally across the street , swift and sure of herself in the traffic . She could live in Europe the rest of her life , Beddoes thought , smiling as he watched her , and all she 'd have to do would be to walk ten steps and everybody would know she had been born on the other side of the ocean . He stood when she opened the door into the terrace . She was hatless , and Beddoes noticed that her hair was much darker than he remembered and she was wearing it longer . He kissed her on both cheeks as she came up to the table . " Welcome , " he said . " In the French style . " She hugged him momentarily . " Well , now , " she said , " here 's the man again . " She sat down , opening her coat , and smiled across the table at him . Her cheeks were flushed from the cold and her eyes were shining and she looked glitteringly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , touching her hand on the table . " American division . What 'll it be to drink ? " " Tea , please . I 'm so glad to see you . " " Tea ? " Beddoes made a face . " Anything wrong ? " " No . " Christina shook her head . " I just want tea . " " That 's a hell of a drink to welcome a traveller home on , " Beddoes said . " With lemon , please , " ' Christina said . Beddoes shrugged , and ordered one tea from the waiter . " How was Egypt ? " Christina asked . " Was I in Egypt ? " Beddoes stared at Christina , enjoying her face . " That 's what it said in the papers . " " Oh , yes , " Beddoes said . " A new world struggling to bep70born , " he said , his voice deep and expert . " Too late for feudalism , too early for democracy . . . " Christina made a face . " Lovely phrases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I mean over a drink how is Egypt . " " Sunny and sad , " Beddoes said . " After two weeks in Cairo you feel sorry for everybody . How is Paris ? " " Too late for democracy , " Christina said , " too early for feudalism . " Beddoes grinned and leaned across the little table and kissed her gently . " I mean over a kiss , " he said , " how is Paris ? " " The same , " Christina said . She hesitated . " Almost the same . " Who 's around ? " " The group , " Christina said carelessly . " The usual happy exiles . Charles , Boris , Anne , Teddy . . . " Teddy was the free-lance photographer . " You see much of him ? " Beddoes asked , very lightly . " Uh ? " Christina smiled , just a little , at him . " Merely checking . " Beddoes grinned . " No , I have n't , " Christina said . " His Greek 's in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greek , " Christina said . The waiter came and placed the tea in front of her . She poured it into the cup and squeezed the lemon . She had long , competent fingers , and Beddoes noticed that she no longer used bright nail polish . " Your hair , " he said . " What happened ? " Christina touched her hair absently . " Oh , " she said . " You noticed ? "  | " Where 're the blondes of yesteryear ? " " I decided to go natural . " Christina stirred her tea . " See what that was like for a change . Like it ? " " I have n't decided yet . It 's longer , too . " " Uh-huh . For the winter . The back of my neck was cold . People say it makes me look younger . " " They 're absolutely right , " Beddoes said . " You now look exactly eleven . " Christina smiled and lifted her cup to him . " To those who return , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Beddoes said . " You 're a finicky , liquor-loving man , " Christina said , and placidly sipped at her tea . " Now , " Beddoes said , " the evening . I thought we might skip our dear friends and go to that place in the markets for dinner , because I 'm dying for a steak , and after that  --  " He stopped . " What 's the matter ? Ca n't we have dinner together ? " " It 's not that , exactly . " Christina kept her head down and stirred her tea slowly . " I have a date  --  " " Cancel him , " Beddoes said promptly . " Cancel the swine . " " I ca n't really . " Christina looked soberly up at him . " He 's coming to meet me here any minute now . " " Oh . " Beddoes nodded . " That makes it different , does n't it . " " Yes . " " Ca n't we shake him ? " " No , " Christina said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't live who ca n't be shaken , " said Beddoes . " Old friend , you say , who just arrived from the horrorsof the desert , just escaped dysentery and religiousp72wars by the skin of his teeth , needs soothing , you say , and tender attention for his shattered nerves , et cetera . " Christina was smiling , but shaking her head . " Sorry , " she said . " It ca n't be done . " " Want me to do it ? " Beddoes said . " Man to man . See here , old fellow , we 're all grown-up , civilized human beings  --  That sort of thing ? " " No , " Christina said . " Why not ? " Beddoes asked , conscious that he was breakinga long-standing and until now jealously adhered-to rule about not pleading for anything . " Why ca n't we ? " " Because I do n't want to , " Christina said . " Oh , " said Beddoes . " The wind is in that direction . " " Variably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We could all have dinner together . The three of us . He 's a very nice man . You 'd like him . " " I never like any man the first night I 'm in Paris , " Beddoessaid . They sat in silence for a moment while Beddoes remembered all the times that Christina had said over the phone , " O.K. , it 's sinful , but I 'll brush him . Meet you at eight . " It was hard to believe , sitting across from her , noticing that there was no obvious change in the way she looked at him , in the way she touched his hand , that she would n't say it in the next minute or so . " Two months is a long time , is n't it ? " Beddoes said . " In Paris ? " " No , " Christina said . " It 's not a long time . In Paris or anywhere else . " " Hello , Christina . " It was a tall , rather heavyset young man , smiling and blond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . " I found the place all right . " He leaned over and kissed her forehead . Beddoes stood up . " Jack , " Christina said , " this is Walter Beddoes . John Haislip . Dr. Haislip . " The two men shook hands . " He 's a surgeon , " Christina said as Haislip gave his hat and coat to the attendant and sat down beside her . " He nearly had his picture in Life last year for something he did with kidneys . In thirty years he 's going to be enormouslyfamous . " Haislip chuckled . He was a big , placid , self-confidentlookingman , with the air of an athlete , who was probably older than he looked . And just with one glance Beddoes could tell how the man felt about Christina . Haislip was n't hiding anything in that department . " What 'll you drink , Doctor ? " Beddoes asked . " Lemonade , please . " " Un citron presse , " Beddoes said to the waiter . He peered curiously at Christina , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't drink , " Christina said . " He says it is n't fair for people who make a living out of cutting other people up " " When I retire , " Haislip said cheerfully , " I 'm going to soak it up and let my hands shake like leaves in the wind . " He turned to Beddoes . You could tell that it took a consciouswrench for him to stop looking at Christina . " Did you have a good time in Egypt ? " he asked . " Oh , " Beddoes said , surprised . " You know about my being in Egypt ? " " Christina 's told me all about you , " Haislip said.  | " I swore a solemn oath that I was going to forget Egypt for a month once I got here , " Beddoes said . Haislip chuckled . He had a low , unforced laugh and his face was friendly and unself-conscious . " I know how you feel , " he said . " The same way I feel about the hospital sometimes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seattle , " Christina said quickly . " How long have you been here ? " Beddoes saw Christina glance at him obliquely as he spoke . " Three weeks , " said Haislip . He turned back toward Christina , as though he could find comfort in no other position . " The changes that can take place in three weeks . My Lord ! " He patted Christina 's arm and chuckled again . " One more week and back to the hospital . " " You here for fun or for business ? " Beddoes asked , fallinghelplessly into the pattern of conversation of all Americanswho meet each other abroad for the first time . " A little of both , " Haislip said . " There was a conference of surgeons I was asked to attend , and I moseyed around a few hospitals on the side . " " What do you think of French medicine now you 've had a chance to see some of it ? " Beddoes asked , the investigatorwithin operating automatically . " Well "  --  Haislip managed to look away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from us over here . Intuitively . They do n't have the equipment we have , or the money for research , and they have to make up for it with insight and intuition . " He grinned . " If you 're feeling poorly , Mr. Beddoes , " he said , " do n't hesitate to put yourself in their hands . You 'll do just about as well here as anyplaceelse. "  | " I feel all right , " Beddoes said , then felt that it had been an idiotic thing to say . The conversation was beginning to make him uncomfortable , not because of anything that had been said but because of the way the man kept looking , so openly and confessingly and completely , at Christina . There was a little pause and Beddoes had the feeling that unless he jumped in , they would sit in silence forever . " Do any sightseeing ? " he asked lamely . " Not as much as I 'd like , " Haislip said . " Just around Paris . I 'd 've loved to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christina keeps talking about . St. Paul de Vence . I guess that 's about as different from Seattle as a man could wish for and still get running water and Christiannourishment . You 've been there , have n't you , Mr. Bed-does ? " " Yes , " Beddoes said . " Christina told me , " said Haislip . " Oh , thank you , " he said to the waiter who put the lemonade down in front of him . Beddoes stared at Christina . They had spent a week together there early in the autumn . He wondered what , exactly , she had told the Doctor . " We 'll make it the next trip , " Haislip said . " Oh , " said Beddoes , noting the " we " and wondering whom it included . " You planning to come over again soon ? " " In three years . " Haislip carefully extracted the ice from his lemonade and put it on the saucer . " I figure I can get away for six weeks in the summer every three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He stood up . " Pardonme , " he said , " but I have to make a couple of telephonecalls. "  | " Downstairs and to the right , " Christina said . " The woman 'll put the calls through for you . She speaks English . Haislip laughed . " Christina does n't trust my French , " he said . " She says it 's the only recognizable Puget Sound accent that has ever been imposed upon the language . " He started away from the table , then stopped . " I sincerely hope you 'll be able to join us for dinner , Mr. Beddoes . " " Well , " Beddoes said , " I made a tentative promise I 'd meet some people . But I 'll see what I can do . " " Good . " Haislip touched Christina 's shoulder lightly , as though for some obscure reassurance , and walked away between the tables . Beddoes watched him , thinking unpleasantly , Well , one thing , I 'm better-looking , anyway . Then he turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of her cup absently with her spoon . " That 's why the hair is long and natural , " Beddoes said . " Is n't it ? " " That 's why . " Christina kept stirring the tea leaves . " And the nail polish . " " And the nail polish . " " And the tea . " " And the tea . " " What did you tell him about St. Paul de Vence ? " " Everything . " " Look up from that damned cup . " Slowly Christina put down the spoon and raised herhead . Her eyes were glistening , but not enough to makeanything of it , and her mouth was set , as with an effort . " What do you mean by everything ? " Beddoes demanded . " Everything . "  | " Why ? " " Because I do n't have to hide anything from him . " " How long have you known him ? " " You heard , " Christina said . " Three weeks . A friend of mine in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you going to do with him ? " Christina looked directly into his eyes . " I 'm going to marry him next week and I 'm going back to Seattle with him . " " And you 'll come back here three years from now for six weeks in the summertime , because people do n't get so sick in the summertime , " Beddoes said . " Exactly . " " And that 's O.K. ? " " Yes . " " You said that too defiantly , " Beddoes said . " Do n't be clever with me , " Christina said harshly . " I 'm through with all that . " " Waiter ! " Beddoes called . " Bring me a whiskey , please . " He said it in English , because for the moment he had forgottenwhere he was . " And you , " he said to Christina . " For the love of God , have a drink . " " Another tea , " Christina said . " Yes , Madame , " said the waiter , and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beddoes asked . " Yes . " " Do I rate straight answers ? " " Yes . " Beddoes took a deep breath and looked through the window . A man in a raincoat was walking past , reading a newspaper and shaking his head . " All right , " Beddoes said . " What 's so great about him ? "  | " What can I be expected to say to that ? " Christina asked . " He 's a gentle , good , useful man . And now what do you know ? " " What else ? " " And he loves me . " She said it in a low voice . In all thetime they 'd been together , Beddoes had n't heard her usethe word before . " He loves me , " Christina repeated flatly . " I saw , " said Beddoes . " Immoderately . " " Immoderately , " Christina said . " Now let me ask another question , " Beddoes said . " Would you like to get up from this table and go off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning it thoughtfully . " Yes , " she said . " But you wo n't , " said Beddoes . " No . " " Why not ? " " Let 's talk about something else , " said Christina . " Where 're you going on your next trip ? Kenya ? Bonn ? Tokyo ? " " Why not ? " " Because I 'm tired of people like you , " Christina said clearly . " I 'm tired of correspondents and pilots and promisingjunior statesmen . I 'm tired of all the brilliant young men who are constantly going someplace to report a revolutionor negotiate a treaty or die in a war . I 'm tired of airportsand I 'm tired of seeing people off . I 'm tired of not being allowed to cry until the plane gets off the ground . I 'm tired of being so damned prompt . I 'm tired of answeringthe telephone . I 'm tired of all the spoiled , hung-over international darlings . I 'm tired of sitting down to dinner with people I used to love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed around the group . I 'm tired of being more in love with people than they are with me . That answer your question ? " " More or less , " Beddoes said . He was surprised that no one at any of the other tables seemed to be paying any special attention to them . " When you left for Egypt , " Christina went on , her voice level , " I decided . I leaned against that wire fence watching them refuelling all those monstrous planes , with the lights on , and I dried the tears and I decided . The next time , it was going to be someone who would be shattered when I took off . " " And you found him . " " I found him , " Christina said flatly . " And I 'm not going to shatter him . " Beddoes put out his hands and took hers . They lay limp in his grasp . " Chris . . . " he said . She was looking out the window . She sat there , outlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and youthful and implacable , making him remember , confusedly , the first time he had met her , and all the best girls he had ever known , and what she had looked like next to him in the early-morning autumnal sunlight that streamed , only three months before , into the hotel room in the south , which overlooked the brown minor Alps and the distant sea . Holding her hands , with the familiar touch of the girlish fingers against his , he felt that if he could get her to turn her head everything would be different . " Chris . . . " he whispered . But she did n't turn her head . " Write me in Seattle , " she said , staring out the window , which was streaked with moisture and in which the lights from within the cafe andp80the lights from the restaurant across the street were reflectedand magnified and distorted . Beddoes let her hands go . She did n't bother to move them . They lay before her , with their pale nail polish glistening dully , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better go . " It was difficult to talk , and his voice sounded strange to him inside his head , and he thought , God , I 'm getting senile , I 'm tempted to cry in restaurants . " I do n't want to wait for the check , " he said . " Tell your friend I 'm sorry I could n't join you for dinner and that I apologize for leaving him with the check . " " That 's all right , " Christina said evenly . " He 'll be happy to pay . " Beddoes leaned over and kissed her , first on one cheek , then on the other . " Goodbye , " he said , thinking he was smiling . " In the French style . " He got his coat quickly and went out . He went past the TWA office to the great boulevard and turned the corner , where the veterans had marched a half hour before . He walked blindly toward the Arch , where the laurel leaves of the wreath were already glistening in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that it was a bad night to be alone and that he ought to go in somewhere and telephone and ask someone to have dinner with him . He passed two or three places with telephones , and although he hesitated before each one , he did n't go in . Because there was no one in the whole city he wanted to see that night.  |p81IT  WAS SATURDAY NIGHT AND PEOPLE WERE KILLING EACHother by the hour on the small screen . Policemen were shot in the line of duty , gangsters were thrown off roofs , and an elderly lady was slowly poisoned for her pearls , and her murderer brought to justice by a cigarette company after a long series of discussions in the office of a private detective . Brave , unarmed actors leaped at villains holding forty-fives , and ingenues were saved from death by the knife by the quick thinking of various handsome and intrepid young men . Peter sat in the big chair in front of the screen , his feet up over the arm , eating grapes . His mother was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stared critically at the violencebefore him . When his mother was around , the fear of appendicitis hung in the air and she watched carefully to see that each seed was neatly extracted and placed in an ashtray . Too , if she were home , there would be irritated little lectures on the quality of television entertainmentp82for the young , and quick-tempered fiddling with the dials to find something that was vaguely defined as educational . Alone , daringly awake at eleven o'clock , Peter ground the seeds between his teeth , enjoying the impolite noise and the solitude and freedom of the empty house . During the televisioncommercials Peter closed his eyes and imagined himselfhurling bottles at large unshaven men with pistols and walking slowly up dark stairways toward the door behind which everyone knew the Boss was waiting , the bulge of his shoulder holster unmistakable under the cloth of his pencilstripedflannel jacket . Peter was thirteen years old . In his class there were three other boys with the same given name , and the history teacher , who thought he was a funny man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grapes , seeds and all ) , Peter Three , and Peter the Great . Peter the Great was , of course , the smallest boy in the class . He weighed only sixtytwopounds , and he wore glasses , and in games he was always the last one to be chosen . The class always laughed when the history teacher called out " Peter the Great , " and Peter Two laughed with them , but he did n't think it was so awfully funny . He had done something pretty good for Peter the Great two weeks ago , and now they were what you might call friends . All the Peters were what you might call friends , on account of that comedian of a history teacher . They were n't real friends , but they had something together , something the other boys did n't have . They did n't like it , but they had it , and it made them responsible for each other . So two weeks ago , when Charley Blaisdell , who weighed a hundred and twenty , took Peter the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Peterp83the Great looked as if he was going to cry , he , Peter Two , grabbed the cap and gave it back and faced Blaisdell . Of course , there was a fight , and Peter thought it was going to be his third defeat of the term , but a wonderful thing happened . In the middle of the fight , just when Peter was hoping one of the teachers would show up ( they sure showed up plenty of times when you did n't need them ) , Blaisdell let a hard one go . Peter ducked and Blaisdell hit him on the top of the head and broke his arm . You could tell right off he broke his arm , because he fell to the ground yelling , and his arm just hung like a piece of string . Walters , the gym teacher , finally showed up and carried Blaisdell off , yelling all the time , and Peter the Great came up and said admiringly , " Boy , one thing you have to admit , you sure have a hard head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he still had his arm in the sling , and every time he was excused from writing on the blackboard because he had a broken arm , Peter got a nice warm feeling all over . Peter the Great hung around him all the time , doing things for him and buying him sodas , because Peter the Great 's parents were divorced and gave him all the money he wanted , to make up to him . And that was O.K.But the best thing was the feeling he 'd had since the fight . It was like what the people on the television must feel after they 'd gone into a room full of enemies and come out with the girl or with the papers or with the suspect , leaving corpses and desolation behind them . Blaisdell weighed a hundred and twenty pounds but that had n't stopped Peter any more than the fact that the spies all had two guns apiece ever stopped the F.S.I. men on the screen . They saw what they had to do and they went inp84and did it , that was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time in his life he had a conscious feeling of confidence and pride in himself . " Let them come , " he muttered obscurely , munching grape seeds and watching the television set through narrowedeyes , " just let them come . " He was going to be a dangerous man , he felt , when he grew up , but one to whom the weak and the unjustly hunted could safely turn . He was sure he was going to be six feet tall , because his father was six feet tall , and all his uncles , and that would help . But he would have to develop his arms . They were just too thin . After all , you could n't depend on people breaking their bones on your head every time . He had been doing pushups each morning and night for the past month . He could only do five and a half at a time so far , but he was going to keep at it until he had arms like steel bars . Arms like that really could mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had to dive under the gun and disarm somebody . You had to have quick reflexes , too , of course , and be able to feint to one side with your eyes before the crucial moment . And , most important of all , no matter what the odds , you had to be fearless . One moment of hesitation and it was a case for the morgue . But now , after the battle of Peter the Great 's cap , he did n't worry about that part of it , the fearless part . From now on , it would just be a question of technique . Comedians began to appear all over the dial , laughing with a lot of teeth , and Peter went into the kitchen and got another bunch of grapes and two tangerines from the refrigerator . He did n't put on the light in the kitchen and it was funny how mysterious a kitchen could be near mid/night when nobody else was home , and there was only the beam of the light from the open refrigerator , casting shadows from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't liked the dark too much and he always turned on lights wherever he went , but you had to practice being fearless , just like anything else . He ate the two tangerines standing in the dark in the kitchen , just for practice . He ate the seeds , too , to show his mother . Then he went back into the living room , carrying the grapes . The comedians were still on and still laughing . He fiddledwith the dial , but they were wearing funny hats and laughing and telling jokes about the income tax on all the channels . If his mother had n't made him promise to go to sleep by ten o'clock , he 'd have turned off the set and gone to bed . He decided not to waste his time and got down on the floor and began to do pushups , trying to be sure to keep his knees straight . He was up to four and slowing down when he heard the scream . He stopped in the middle of a pushup and waited , just to make sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was real loud . He looked up at the television set . There was a man there talking about floor wax , a man with a mustache and a lot of teeth , and it was a cinch he was n't doing any screaming . The next time the scream came there was moaning and talking at the end of it , and the sound of fists beating on the front door . Peter got up and turned off the television , just to be sure the sounds he was hearing were n't somehowbeing broadcast . The beating on the door began again and a woman 's voice cried " Please , please , please . . . " and there was no doubt about it any more.  |p86Peter  looked around him at the empty room . Three lamps were lit and the room was nice and bright and the light was reflected off the grapes and off the glass of the picture of the boats on Cape Cod that his Aunt Martha painted the year she was up there . The television set stood in the corner , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cushions of the soft chair he had been sitting in to watch the programs were pushed in and he knew his mother would come and plump them out before she went to sleep , and the whole room looked like a place in which it was impossible to hear a woman screaming at midnight and beating on the door with her fists and yelling , " Please , please , please . . . The woman at the door yelled " Murder , murder , he 's killing me ! " and for the first time Peter was sorry his parents had gone out that night . " Open the door ! " the woman yelled . " Please , please open the door ! " You could tell she was n't saying please just to be polite by now . Peter looked nervously around him . The room , with all its lights , seemed strange , and there were shadows behind everything . Then the woman yelled again , just noise this time . Either a person is fearless , Peter thought coldly , or he is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a long mirror in the foyer and he got a good look at himself . His arms looked very thin . The woman began hammering once more on the front door and Peter looked at it closely . It was a big steel door , but it was shaking minutely , as though somebody with a machine was working on it . For the first time he heard another voice . It was a man 's voice , only it did n't sound quite like a man 's voice . It sounded like an animal in ap87cave , growling and deciding to do something unreasonable . In all the scenes of threat and violence on the television set , Peter had never heard anything at all like it . He moved slowly toward the door , feeling the way he had felt when he had the flu , remembering how thin his arms looked in the mirror , regretting that he had decided to be fearless . " Oh , God ! " the woman yelled , " Oh , God , do n't do it ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal sound of the beast in the cave that you never heard over the air , and he threw the door open . Mrs. Chalmers was there in the vestibule , on her knees , facing him , and behind her Mr. Chalmers was standing , leaning against the wall , with the door to his own apartmentopen behind him . Mr. Chalmers was making that funny sound and he had a gun in his hand and he was pointing it at Mrs. Chalmers . The vestibule was small and it had what Peter 's mother called Early American wallpaper and a brass light fixture . There were only the two doors opening on the vestibule , and the Chalmers had a mat in front of theirs with " Welcome " written on it . The Chalmers were in their midthirties , and Peter 's mother always said about them , " One thing about our neighbors , they are quiet . " She also said that Mrs. Chalmers put a lot of money on her back . Mrs. Chalmers was kind of fat and her hair was pretty blond and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though she had been in the beauty parlor all afternoon . She always said " My , you 're getting to be a big boy " to Peter when she met him in the elevator , in a soft voice , as though she was just about to laugh . She must have said that fifty times by now . She had a good , strong smell of perfume on her all the time , too.  |p88Mr  . Chalmers wore pince-nez glasses most of the time and he was getting bald and he worked late at his office a good many evenings of the week . When he met Peter in the elevator he would say , " It 's getting colder , " or " It 's getting warmer , " and that was all , so Peter had no opinion about him , except that he looked like the principal of a school . But now Mrs. Chalmers was on her knees in the vestibule and her dress was torn and she was crying and there were black streaks on her cheeks and she did n't look as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Mr. Chalmers was n't wearing a jacket and he did n't have his glasses on and what hair he had was mussed all over his head and he was leaning against the Early American wallpaper making this animal noise , and he had a big , heavy pistol in his hand and he was pointing it right at Mrs. Chalmers . " Let me in ! " Mrs. Chalmers yelled , still on her knees . " You 've got to let me in . He 's going to kill me . Please ! " " Mrs. Chalmers . . . " Peter began . His voice sounded as though he were trying to talk under water , and it was very hard to say the " s " at the end of her name . He put out his hands uncertainly in front of him , as though he expected somebody to throw him something . " Get inside , you , " Mr. Chalmers said . Peter looked at Mr. Chalmers . He was only five feet away and without his glasses he was squinting . Peter feinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life he thought he had feinted with his eyes . Mr. Chalmers did n't do anything . He just stood there , with the pistol pointed , somehow , it seemed to Peter , at both Mrs. Chalmers and himself at the same time . Five feet was a long distance , a long , long distance . " Good night , " Peter said , and he closed the door.  |p89There  was a single sob on the other side of the door and that was all . Peter went in and put the uneaten grapes back in the refrigerator , flicking on the light as he went into the kitchen and leaving it on when he went out . Then he went back to the living room and got the stems from the first bunch of grapes and threw them into the fireplace , becauseotherwise his mother would notice and look for the seeds and not see them and give him four tablespoons of milk of magnesia the next day . Then , leaving the lights on in the living room , although he knew what his mother would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his room and quickly got into bed . He waited for the sound of shots . There were two or three noises that might have been shots , but in the city it was hard to tell . He was still awake when his parents came home . He heard his mother 's voice , and he knew from the sound she was complaining about the lights in the living room and kitchen , but he pretended to be sleeping when she came into his room to look at him . He did n't want to start in with his mother about the Chalmers , because then she 'd ask when it had happened and she 'd want to know what he was doing up at twelve o'clock . He kept listening for shots for a long time , and he got hot and damp under the covers and then freezing cold . He heard several sharp , ambiguous noises in the quiet night , but nothing that you could be sure about , and after a while he fell asleep . In the morning , Peter got out of bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apartment without waking his parents . The vestibule looked just the way itp90always did , with the brass lamp and the flowered wallpaper and the Chalmers ' doormat with " Welcome " on it . There were no bodies and no blood . Sometimes when Mrs. Chalmershad been standing there waiting for the elevator , you could smell her perfume for a long time after . But now there was no smell of perfume , just the dusty , apartmenthouseusual smell . Peter stared at the Chalmers ' door nervously while waiting for the elevator to come up , but it did n't open and no sound came from within . Sam , the man who ran the elevator and who did n't like him , anyway , only grunted when Peter got into the elevator , and Peter decided not to ask him any questions . He went out into the chilly , bright Sunday-morning street , half expecting to see the morgue wagon in front of the door , or at least two or three prowl cars . But there was only a sleepy woman in slacks airing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurrying up from the corner with the newspapers under his arm . Peter went across the street and looked up to the sixth floor , at the windows of the Chalmers ' apartment . The Venetian blinds were pulled shut in every room and all the windows were closed . A policeman walked down the other side of the street , heavy , blue and purposeful , and for a moment Peter felt close to arrest . But the policeman continued on toward the avenue and turned the corner and disappeared and Peter said to himself , They never know anything . He walked up and down the street , first on one side , then on the other , waiting , although it was hard to know what he was waiting for . He saw a hand come out through the blinds in his parents ' room and slam the window shut , and he knew he ought to get upstairs quickly with a good ex/cuse for being out , but he could n't face them this morning , and he would invent an excuse later . Maybe he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he doubted that his mother would swallow that . Some excuse . Later . Then , after he had been patrolling the street for almost two hours , and just as he was coming up to the entrance of his building , the door opened and Mr. and Mrs. Chalmers came out . He had on his pince-nez and a dark-gray hat , and Mrs. Chalmers had on her fur coat and a red hat with feathers on it . Mr. Chalmers was holding the door open politely for his wife , and she looked , as she came out the door , as though she had just come from the beauty parlor . It was too late to turn back or avoid them , and Peter just stood still , five feet from the entrance . " Good morning , " Mr. Chalmers said as he took his wife 's arm and they started walking past Peter . " Good morning , Peter , " said Mrs. Chalmers in her soft voice , smiling at him . " Is n't it a nice day today ? " " Good morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came out and sounded like good morning . The Chalmers walked down the street toward Madison Avenue , two married people , arm in arm , going to church or to a big hotel for Sunday breakfast . Peter watched them , ashamed . He was ashamed of Mrs. Chalmers for looking the way she did the night before , down on her knees , and yellinglike that and being so afraid . He was ashamed of Mr. Chalmers for making the noise that was not like the noise of a human being , and for threatening to shoot Mrs. Chalmersand not doing it . And he was ashamed of himself because he had been fearless when he opened the door , but had not been fearless ten seconds later , with Mr. Chalmers five feet away with the gun . He was ashamed of himself forp92not taking Mrs. Chalmers into the apartment , ashamed because he was not lying now with a bullet in his heart . But most of all he was ashamed because they had all said good morning to each other and the Chalmers were walking quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toward Madison Avenue . It was nearly eleven o'clock when Peter got back to the apartment , but his parents had gone back to sleep . There was a pretty good program on at eleven , about counterspies in Asia , and he turned it on automatically , while eating an orange . It was pretty exciting , but then there was a part in which an Oriental held a ticking bomb in his hand in a roomful of Americans , and Peter could tell what was coming . The hero , who was fearless and who came from California , was beginning to feint with his eyes , and Peter reached over and turned the set off . It closed down with a shivering , collapsing pattern . Blinking a little , Peter watched the blind screen for a moment . Ah , he thought in sudden , permanent disbelief , after the night in which he had faced the incomprehensible , shameless , weaponed grownup world and had failed to disarm it , ah , they can have that , that 's for kids.  |p93HE  HAD THE DREAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments the next morning , and forgot about it until one evening in April , ten minutes before his plane was scheduled to take off . Then , suddenly , it returned to him . Always , when he was about to board a plane , there was a slight tremor ; an awareness of risk , howeversmall and controlled ; a slight , subconscious realization that each flight might end with death ; a hidden knowledge that there was a small , lurking fatality in winds and cloud and valves and wings , and that no amount of airline skill and care and advertising could ever absolutely dispel it . It was that usual minute , buried twinge of disaster that made him remember the dream as he stood at the gate with his wife and sister , looking out at the dark field and the huge , substantial plane and the flickering lights that marked the runways . The dream had been a simple one . In it , somehow , his sister Elizabeth had died , and he had , in a resigned andp94hopeless way , followed the coffin to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the ground , and then he had returned home . And somehow , in the dream , it had all happened on May 14th . The date had been absolutely clear and definite and had given the dream a real , tragic sense that it might not otherwise have had . When he woke , he tried to figure out why May 14th , an obscure day five months in the future , had been chosen so relentlessly and specifically by his dreaming mind , but it was no use . There were no birthdays in his family in May , no anniversaries , and nothing in particular had ever happened to him or anyone he knew on that day . He had laughed a little , sleepily , to himself , gently touched Alice 's bare shoulder in the bed beside him , and had risen and gone to work , in the sensible , everyday atmosphere of drafting boards and blueprints , without saying a word then or later to her or anyone else about the dream . And then  --  laughing at the way his five-year-old daughter had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment , standing there with the noise of engines filling the fresh April evening air , kissing his sister Elizabethgoodbye  --  the dream came back . Elizabeth was as rosy and sturdy as ever , a cheerful , pretty girl who looked as though she had just come triumphantly off a tennis court or from a swimming meet , and if there was any touch of doom hanging over her , it was very well hidden . " Bring me back Gary Grant , " Elizabeth said as she brushed his cheek . " Of course , " Roy said . " I now leave you two to say a fond farewell , " Elizabeth said . " Alice , give him his last-minute instructions . Tell him to behave himself . "  | " I 've already briefed him for this mission , " Alice said . " No girls . No more than three Martinis before dinner . Telephone me and report twice weekly . Get on the plane and get home the minute the job is done . " " Two weeks , " Roy said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't have too good a time . " Alice was smiling but on the verge of tears , as she always was every time he went anyplace without her , even overnight to Washington . " I wo n't , " Roy said . " I promise to be miserable . " " Good enough . " Alice laughed . " No old telephone numbers secreted on your person ? " Elizabeth asked . " No . " There had been a period in Roy 's life , just before he married Alice , when he had been quite lively , and duringthe war some of his friends had come back from Europe with lurid and highly fictionized tales of wild times in Paris and London , and to the women of his family he seemed more dashing and unstable than was the fact . " God , " he said , " it 'll be a relief getting away from this female board of directors for a few days . " He and Alice went up to the gate . " Take care of yourself , darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He kissed her . " I hate this , " Alice said , holding onto him . " We 're always saying goodbye . This is the last time . From now on , no matter where you go , I 'm going with you . " " All right . " Roy smiled down at her . " Even if you only go to Yankee Stadium . " " Could n't be more pleased . " He held her tightly for a moment , dear and familiar and forlorn , left behind this way . Then he walked out to the plane . He turned as hep96started to climb into it , and waved . Alice and Elizabeth waved back , and he noticed again how much alike they looked , standing together , like two sisters in a pretty family , both of them blond and fair , trim , with little tricks of movement and holding themselves that were almost identical . He turned and went into the plane , and a moment later the door was shut behind him and the plane started rolling toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the phone between Los Angeles and New York , Roy told Alice she would have to come West . " Munson says it 's going to take six months , " Roy said , " and he 's promised me a place to live , and you are hereby in-vited . " " Thanks , " Alice said . " Tell Munson I would like to kick him in the teeth . " " Ca n't be helped , baby , " Roy said . " Commerce above all . You know . " " Why could n't he have told you before you went out ? Then you could 've helped me close up the apartment and we could 've gone out together . " " He did n't know before I came out , " Roy said patiently . " The world is very confused these days . " " I would like to kick him in the teeth . " " O.K. " Roy grinned . " You come out and tell him yourself . When do you arrive ? Tomorrow ? " " There 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice said . " I am not a troop movement . You ca n't say , Civilian Alice Gaynor will report three thousand miles from here at 4 P.M. tomorrow , ' and expect it to happen . " " O.K. , you 're not a troop movement . When ? "  |p97Alice  chuckled . " You sound nice and anxious . " " I am nice and anxious . " " That 's good . " " When ? " " Well "  --  Alice hesitated thoughtfully  --  " I have to get Sally out of school , I have to send some things to storage , I have to rent the apartment , I have to get plane reser-vations  --  " " When ? " " Two weeks , " Alice said , " if I can get the reservations all right . Can you wait ? " " No , " Roy said . " Neither can I. " They both laughed . " Have you been very gay out there ? " Roy recognized the tentative , inquiring tone and sighed to himself . " Dull as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eveningsand read . I 've read six books and I 'm halfway through General Marshall 's report on the conduct of the war . " " There was one evening you did n't read . " Alice 's voice was careful and purposely light . " All right , " Roy said flatly . " Let 's hear it . " " Monica came in from the Coast Tuesday and she called me . She said she saw you with a beautiful girl at a fancy restaurant . " " If there was any justice , " Roy said . " " She was absolutely right , " Roy said . " The girl had long black hair . " " Do n't shout . I can hear perfectly well . " " What Monica neglected to say was that it was Charlie Lewis 's wife  --  "  | " She said you were alone . " "  --  and Charlie Lewis was twenty feet away , in the men 's room . " " Are you sure ? " " No . Maybe he was in the ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , but with your history  --  " " I will match my history with any husband 's , " Roy said . " I hate your sense of humor on this subject . " Alice'svoice began to tremble a little , and Roy relented . " Listen , baby , " he said softly . " Get out here quick . Quick as you can . Then we can stop this nonsense . " " I 'm sorry . " Alice 's voice was soft and repentant . " It'sjust that we 've been away from each other for so long inthese last few years . I 'm foolish and jittery . Who 's payingfor this call ? " " The company . " " That 's good . " Alice chuckled . " I 'd hate to fight on our own money . Do you love me ? " " Get out here quick . " " Do you consider that an answer to my question ? " " Yes . " " O.K. , " Alice said . " So do I. Goodbye , darling . See you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Roy . " I will . Goodbye . " Roy hung up . First he shook his head a little wearily , remembering the argument ; then he smiled , remembering the end of the conversation . He got up from his chair and went over to the calendar on the desk , to try to figure what day he could expect his wife and child . The telegram came three days later : " RESERVATIONS ON 2O'CLOCK FLIGHT MAY 14 . WILL ARRIVE BURBANK AT 10 P.M. YOUR TIME . PLEASE SHAVE . LOVE , ALICE . "  |p99Roy  grinned as he reread the telegram , then became conscious of a sensation of uneasiness that refused to be crystallizedor pinned down . He walked around all that day with that undefined sense of trouble , and it was n't until he was dozing off to sleep that night that it suddenly became clear to him . He woke and got out of bed and read the telegram again . May 14th . He kept the lamp on and lit a cigarette and sat up in the narrow bed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . He had never been a superstitious man , or even a religiousman , and he had always laughed at his mother , who had a fund of dreams and predictions and omens of good and evil at her command . Alice had one or two superstitioushabits  --  like not talking about anything that she wanted to have happen , because she was sure it would n't happen if it were mentioned or hoped for too much  --  but he had always scorned them , too . During the war , when every magazine assured the world that there were no atheists in foxholes , he had never prayed , even in the most gloomy and dangerous times . He had never , in all his adult life , done anything as a result of superstition or premonition . He looked around him at his efficiently furnished , bright , twentieth-century room and felt foolish to be awake now in the heel of the night , chasing phantoms and echoingwarnings and scraps of old dreams through the sensible channels of his engineer 's mind . The dream , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on May 14th . But dreams never were what they seemed to be , and Elizabeth and Alice looked so much alike , and they were always together and such good friends . ... He knew enough about dreams to understand that it would be a simple transference in that shadowy , whimsical world  --  a wife for a sister , a sister for a wife . And now , ofp100all the days in the year , his wife and child had picked May 14th to fly the three thousand miles over the rivers and mountains of the continent from New York to California . He put out the light much later , with nothing decided , and tried to sleep . He stared up at the dark ceiling , listening to the occasional swift swhoosh of a car on the street outside , hurrying home through the waning night . For a man who did n't believe in Fate , he thought , who saw the world in terms of simple cause and effect ; who felt that no act was inevitable , that what was going to happen tomorrowor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variable ; who felt that no man 's death or burial place was fixed , that no event was recorded in any future book , that the human race got hints or warnings from no supernatural source  --  this was a ludicrous and profitless way to spend a night . For a man who walked under ladders , cheerfully broke mirrors , never had his palm read or his fortune told from cards , he felt that he was behaving idiotically , and yet he could n't sleep . In the morning he called New York . " Alice , " he said , " I want you to come by train . " " What 's the matter ? " she said . " I 'm afraid of the plane . " He heard her laugh incredulouslyover the phone . " I 'm afraid of the plane , " he repeatedstubbornly . " Do n't be silly , " Alice said . " They have n't had an accidentwith that plane yet , and they wo n't start now . " " Even so  --  " " And I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days in a roomette , " Alice said . " It would take me the whole summer to recover . " " Please , " Roy said.  | " And I could n't get train reservations for weeks , " Alice said , " and the apartment 's rented and everything . What 's come over you ? " Her voice sounded suspicious and wary . " Nothing , " Roy said . " It 's just that I 'm worried about flying . " " Good God ! " Alice said . " You 've flown two hundred thousand miles in all sorts of contraptions . " " I know , " Roy said . " That 's why I 'm worried . " " Are you drunk ? " Alice asked . " Alice , darling , " Roy sighed . " It 's eight o'clock in the morning out here . " " Well , you sound queer . " " I 've been up all night , worrying . " " Well , stop worrying . I 'll see you on the fourteenth . Are you sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is a very strange telephone call , I must say . " " I 'm sorry . " They talked for a moment more , but quite coldly , and Roy hung up feeling dissatisfied and defeated . He called again two days later and tried once more . " Do n't ask any questions , " he said . " Just do this for me , and I 'll explain when you get out here . If you want tocome on the plane , that 's all right , but do n't come on thefourteenth . Come on the fifteenth or sixteenth or seventeenth . Any other day . But not on the fourteenth . " " Roy , " Alice said , " you 've got me terribly worried . What 's come over you ? I 've asked Elizabeth and she saysthat this does n't sound like you at all . " " How is she ? " Roy asked . " Elizabeth is fine . She tells me to ignore you and come out as scheduled . "  | " Tell her to mind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleeping badly and his voice was raw and nervous , and Alice reacted to it . " I think I know what 's going on , " she said coldly . " Monica told me there 's a big party at the Condons ' on the fourteenth , and you 've probably promised to take someoneelse , and a wife would be a big handicap  --  " " Oh , God , will you stop that ! " Roy shouted into the phone . " I have n't been married to you for seven years for nothing , " Alice said . " I 'm not blind . " " Come out today ! " Roy shouted . " Come out tomorrow ! Come out the thirteenth ! Only not the fourteenth ! " " You know as well as I do that if I give up my reservations , I wo n't get another until June . If you do n't want to see me any more , tell me . You do n't have to go through all this rigmarole . " " Alice , darling , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you . " " Well , then , stop this nonsense or tell me what it 's all about . " " Alice , it 's this way , " he began , resolved to tell her , no matter how much of an idiot it made him feel , but there was a click on the wire and then three thousand miles of whispering silence . By the time he got Alice back on the phone , ten minutes later , he felt too ridiculous , felt that he could not live with himself or his wife if he at this late date exposed himself as a silly , undependable man with a brain gone soft and nervous and irresponsible after all the sane , dependable years . " I have n't anything else to say , " he told Alice when the operator finally made the connection , " except that I lovep103you very much and I could n't bear it if anything ever happened to you . " He heard Alice crying softly at the other end of the wire . " We have to be together soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And please do n't call me any more , Roy , darling . You 're acting so strangely , and after I talk to you , the most miserableideas grab hold of me . Will it be all right when I get out there ? " " It 'll be wonderful , darling , " Roy said . " And you 'll never go away without me again ? Never ? " " Never . " He could close his eyes and see her crouched like a little girl over the phone in the bedroom of their quiet , pleasant home , both her hands on the instrument , her pretty , clever face screwed up with grief and longing , and it was hard to say anything more . " Good night , " he said . " Be careful . " He hung up and stared wildly at the blank wall on the other side of the room , knowing he would n't sleep again that night . There was an early fog on the morning of May 14th , and Roy stared at it , hot-eyed and lightheaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the quiet , gray streets , with only police cars and milk-delivery carts disturbingthe soft , thick dawn . California , he thought ; it 's always foggy in the morning , fog is general in California before eight , and it 's a different time and a different weather on the coast of the Atlantic , and her plane is n't due to leave for hours yet . It must be the war , he thought . This would never have happened to me before the war . I thought I came out all right , but maybe I was overconfident . All the cemeteries ,  |p104with  the young men tucked away in the sand and spring grass , and the old ladies in black lace dresses dying on the next street in London in the air raids . A man 's imagination was bound to take a morbid turn , finally . I must take hold of myself , he told himself reasonably . I 'm the man who always felt sane , balanced , healthy in all situations , who always scorned mediums and table tappers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he stopped to stare at the distant smudge of mountains that stood guard over the eastern approaches of the city . Planes had to come in steeply over them and circle the city and land from the westward side . A strip of blue appeared above the mountainsand widened and widened , and the fog melted away in wisps among the ugly , fat palm trees that lined the street , and soon the sun was shining on the dewy lawns , and the sky looked clear and blue from Beverly Hills to Scotland . He went back to his hotel and lay down without even taking his shoes off . Some time later he woke up . Vaguely , in the moment before waking , there was a confusion of planes going down in puffs of smoke , like the newsreel of an air battle , and Sally 's voice over it , regretfully saying , as she always did at bedtime , " Do I really have to go to sleep now ? I 'm terribly wide awake . " He looked at the clock . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airport now , and the big plane was waiting on the field , with the mechanics fiddling on it and the men checking the gas tanks . The hell with it , he thought . I do n't care how foolish I seem . He picked up the phone . " LaGuardia Field , New York , " he said.  | " There will be a slight delay , " the operator sang . " I will call you . " " This is very important , " Roy said . " Urgent . " " There will be a slight delay , " the operator said in exactly the same tones . " I will call you . " He hung up and went to the window and stared out . The sky stretched , radiant and clear , over the hills toward New York . I 'll tell her the whole thing , he thought , idiotic or not . Forbid her to get on the plane . We can laugh about it later . I 'll take the first plane back myself and fly back with them . That 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went and got out his valise and put three shirts in it , then picked up the phone again . Five minutes later he got the airport , but it took another five minutes to get through to the station manager for the airline . " My name is Gaynor "  --  Roy 's voice was high and hurried  --  " and this is a very unusual request , so please listen carefully . " " What was that name , sir ? " " Gaynor . G-a-y-n-o-r . " " Oh , yes , Gaynor . Like the dive . " The distant voice laughed politely at its own joke . " What can I do for you , sir ? " " My wife and child  --  " " You will have to speak louder , please . " " My wife and child ! " Roy shouted . " Mrs. Alice Gaynor , on the two-o'clock flight to Los Angeles . I want you to stop them  --  " " What did you say ? " " I said I wanted you to stop them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Alice Gaynor . The twoo'clockflight to Los Angeles  --  " " I 'm afraid that 's impossible , Mr. Gaynor . " The voice was puzzled but polite . " It ca n't be impossible . All you have to do is announce it over the public-address system and  --  " " Impossible , sir . The two-o'clock flight is just taking off at this moment . I 'm terribly sorry . Is there anything else I can do for you ? " " No , " Roy said flatly , and put the phone down . He sat on the edge of his bed for a moment , then got up and went to the window . He looked out at the bright sky and the green-and-yellow mountains . He remained standing there , staring at the mountains , waiting for the call from the airline.  |p107FREDERICK  MULL WAS A HUGE ROLLICKING MAN , WITH Arusset mustache , but when they took the trolleys off Third Avenue and put him on a pension he sickened and died , he who had never missed a day of work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of argumentsa man from time to time could not avoid on evenings out with high-spirited and honorable companions . It was bad enough when they took away his conductor and made him make his own change in the front of the trolley , with all the traffic of New York charging and howling around him , but when they put the buses on and told him he 'd have to learn how to drive if he wanted to stay with the company , he knew and the company knew he was finished . All this shows how long ago it all was , when there was snow in the city every winter and the lakes froze over and all the comfortable brown buildings had n't been torn down for gray and glass office slabs and it did n't take allp108day to go from the Bridge to Yorkville by surface transportation . He had his faults . He drank whisky when he could afford it and beer when he could n't and they carried him home to his wife one night with a concussion that lasted two days that he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a man named Mulloy near Fortieth Street . His father had fought in the Union Army , under McClellan , and he was an unswerving patriot . He was part-everything , he said , because his father 's family had come from the Midlands and his mother was one-eighth Indian . He had a slow , barrelling baritone and when he had drunk one or two he would sing " Flow Gently , Sweet Afton " and " Good King Wenceslaus " and " Oh , Susannah . " But most of all he was partial to " John Brown 's Body Lies AMoulderingin the Grave " and " Who Is Sylvia ? " According to his wife , he also had a weakness for women . The sole basis for this belief came from something that happened in the summer of 1921 , when they were at a hotel at Croton Falls , recovering from the birth of their daughter , and Mrs. Mull looked out of her window on a moonlit night and saw her husband kissing a red-headed woman whose husband was not due to arrive until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew what she was up to , the red-headed woman pinned him against a pillar after dinner , while he was quietly smoking his pipe , and threw her arms around him and kissed him , missing his mouth , in her anxiety , by a good margin . But Mrs. Mull would have none of that , and from that moment until the day he died , Mr. Mull enjoyed the reputation with his wife of being a wild , philandering ladies ' man . It was her contention that the women of the great cityp109of New York rode on the Third Avenue trolley for the sole purpose of corrupting her husband . There was a story , it is true , that on a spring day in 1919 a widow in a veil walked forward along the aisle and slipped her address on an embossed card into his hand while she was waiting for the car to stop at Seventy-ninth Street , but there were many stories in those days about motormen and locomotive engineers and people like that , not all of them worthy of belief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives with similar cunning tricks , his wife took to waiting along the route at odd and unsuspected hours for his trolley to appear . Once or twice he saw her in time , standing there next to the elevated pillar holding their little dark-haired daughter , Clarice , by the hand and he merely passed her by . She would scream like a forsaken bride , shaking her fist after the yellow car rattling down the tracks toward the Bowery , with the taxi-drivers stoppingtheir cabs to gawk at her in wonder , but naturally , she could n't denounce him to the company . So she descended to guile and picked corners where there 'd be sure to be at least eight or ten other passengers waiting that , for his job 's sake , he could n't dare sail by . Even years after she had given up the practice , he 'd tighten visibly at the box when he approached Twenty-third Street , ThirtyfourthStreet , or the back entrance of Bloomingdale 's . When she climbed into the car , she 'd nod icily to Mr. Coombs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , pay her nickel , march up the aisle toward the head of the car , daring any other woman who happened to be sitting there to look at her . She 'd never say a word to her husband . She 'd just sit there , boring holes in thep110back of his head with her eyes , until he could n't stand it anymore and he 'd draw the leather curtain they had around the motorman 's position to keep the reflection of the lights within the car from confusing him on the night run . The night shifts were of course the worst . She 'd sit up for him in the dark cold kitchen with a blanket wrapped around her like a fisherman 's wife during a storm waiting for the lighthouse keeper to come knocking on the door with the bad news . And when he did come home she 'd pretend to be making coffee and getting out the biscuits , but all the time she was sniffing him for perfume like a hound on new tracks and her eyes would be going over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a bloodstained map . He was a good-natured man and he made no complaint . He 'd only been married that once and he supposed that was what the institution was like . He was content enough . He had his whisky on and off the route and played with Clarice and taught her " Who Is Sylvia ? " He endured the reproaches of his wife as he enduredthe weather and traffic policemen , and in the end he took it as a sign of love , which indeed it was , and he would have been lonely and lost without it . Everything considered , they lived together for nearly thirty years in what would certainly pass in these days as happiness . He lived to see his only daughter married to a good man by the name of Smalley , who had a dependable job as an insurance adjuster , and at the wedding he said to the groom , " Ah , man , at least in your trade they 'll never tear the tracks out from under you . " Mr. Smalley was of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected , since Mrs. Mull had spent a good part of her life warning her daughter not to marry a man like her father . Mr. Mull had heard many of these warnings in his time and while he had not actively set the seal of his approval upon them , he had been seen to nod in quiet agreement with his wife 's directives . He admired her intelligence vastly and took her word for gospel in all questions of taste and affection . The only pleasure Mr. Smalley took outside his home was prevailing upon people who had broken their legs in industrial accidents or who had lost their goods by fire to settle for less than they had originally asked from the company . He had never been seen inside a saloon and he looked at his shoetops when he passed women in the street . He was a good provider , and while he did not seem capable of presenting his wife with an heir , he insisted upon her having a maid come in three afternoons a week to help with the cleaning and ironing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly , keeping his photograph on the mantelpiece , with his mustaches brushed , and saying to visitors , over a cup of tea , " Ah , nobody knows the life that man led me . " She dreamt about him constantly through the years , conversing with him in her sleep in wifely tones and walking over the next morning to her daughter 's home to tell her about it . " Your father visited me again last night , " Mrs. Mull would say , " and we had a nice long talk about the time we went up the river to Newburgh and the picnic steamer almost capsized in the rain . " Or , " We had a serious talk last night and he promised to drink only beer until the Sunday after Easter . " And sometimes Mrs. Mull would hurry over with her eyes shining , to say , " He was in veryp112good spirits last night , not affected by drink or anything like that , you understand , but jolly , and he sang Flow Gently , Sweet Afton ' and four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " Clarice took the reports of these conversations calmly . She had loved her father and thought him by far the most interesting man she had ever known and it seemed to her entirely natural that his memory died hard . And her mother was a lonely old woman , living in one room with very little to occupy her after an exhilarating lifetime of nagging an obstreperous and lovable man , and Clarice felt that these matter-of-fact nocturnal visits from the grave lightened her mother 's solitude and gave point to her days . But one morning the whole atmosphere changed . Her mother appeared early , white-lipped and angry . " He came again last night , " she said , almost as soon as she walked through the door of Clarice 's apartment . " Did you have a nice visit ? " Clarice asked , according to her usual formula . " We did not , " Mrs. Mull said . " We had a mortifying evening . " " Oh , Mother , " Clarice said , " is that nice ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mrs. Mull , " in my place . " " You must be careful not to hurt him , " Clarice said soothingly . " Remember , he 's an old man . " " Hurt him ! " Mrs. Mull snorted . " Try and hurt that man . He has the hide of an elephant . " " What happened ? " Clarice asked . " The bell rang , " said Mrs. Mull , " and there he was , standing there , with that smirk on his face he always has when he knows he 's doing something that will annoy me. "  | " Now , Mother , " Clarice began , " you must n't read into things ... " " Read into things ! " Mrs. Mull said . " Wait until you hear the story and then say read into things . Do you know what that man had the cold , icy courage to do last night ? " She paused and Clarice dutifully said , " What ? " " Finally , " Mrs. Mull said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've learned to take the bad with the good , but even saints have their limits . And when I saw them standing there outside the door last night , I knew . . . . " " What ? " Clarice asked , puzzled . " What do you mean , them ? " " What I mean , exactly , " Mrs. Mull said tightly , " is them . Your father and that red-headed woman in a crepede-Chinedress so tight you 'd wonder how she could breathe the air or digest her food , and the child . " " What child ? " Clarice asked faintly . " A big , lumpish boy , " said Mrs. Mull , " growing out of his clothes , with the same smirk on his face . Put a mustache on him and he could go down to the carbarn any day of the week and take out a car and run the full length of Third Avenue and nobody would know the difference . " " Now , Mother , " Clarice said . She had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch at Croton Falls in the summer of 1921 , but this was the first intimation of issue . " I never heard of any child . " " Neither did I , " Mrs. Mull said , " until last night . Oh , he was the most deceptive man who ever walked the streets of the city . But last night he tore away the veil . Standing there , as cool as you please , with that woman 's hand on his arm and that unmistakable child , saying , Bertha , I'vep114brought some friends . Are there any refreshments in the house ? ' " " And what did you do then ? " Clarice asked , humoring her mother , but curious , also . " Oh , I was polite , " Mrs. Mull said . " I never held with making scenes before strangers and your father knows that and depends upon it . I gave her a cold bow and I took the boy 's cap and I ushered them in with all civility and I made them tea and set out half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sat there , putting in a yes or no from time to time while that woman talked about Croton Falls and how she found the summer weather a little sticky and how she suspected they used margarine in the kitchen for cooking , although they swore they used butter . I 'll tell the truth , I did n't go out of my way to make them comfortable , and they cut their visit mercifully short . I took the opportunity of getting your father off to one side for a moment and I told him , in no uncertain terms , that that was the last I wanted to see of that woman and their child of sin . I said , clear and definite , so there would be no misunderstanding in the future , that if he expected to see me again , he would have to make his visits alone . " " What did Father say to that ? " Clarice asked . " He did n't say anything , " Mrs. Mull said . " Before he could open his mouth , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm and said , Frederick , it 's getting late , we 're expected downtown , ' and off they went together , after kindly thanking me for the tea , all unholy shameless three of them . " Clarice was a sensible girl and she said the right thing to restore order and harmony . " I do n't think you havep115anything more to worry about now , " she told her mother . " I 'm sure he 'll take the hint . " " He 'd better , " Mrs. Mull said fiercely , " or he 'll find the door locked in his face . " For the next week or so , Mrs. Mull reported , all went well . Mr. Mull visited her three times , rather quiet and absent-minded , but alone . She herself had decided to be tolerant and keep her own counsel , and she had tactfully not brought up the subject of the red-headed woman and the unmistakable boy . But then the devil came up in him again , and on a Saturdaynight he rang the bell and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-headed woman on his arm with every wrinkle of her corset showing as clear as light through her skin-tight dress , and of course , that lump of a boy , with his father 's Saturday-night expression built into his face . " He stood there in the hallway , " Mrs. Mull told Clarice on the following Monday morning , " grinning and enjoying his guilt , saying , We were just passing by and we thought maybe you 'd be in the mood for a little com-pany ' " Mrs. Mull had had to wait until Monday to tell Clarice , because Clarice had been in Providence for the weekend , visiting the family of Mr. Smalley . The enforced delay had enabled Mrs. Mull to arrange the details eloquently in her mind and she started her story even before she took off her hat in Clarice 's living room . " I took one look at him , " Mrs. Mull said , " and I let my eyes pass significantly over that woman and her criminal son and it was n't wasted on your father , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are n't you going to invitep116us in for a minute , Bertha ? ' he says , standing there between the two of them , like a prize bull at a fair . I warned you , Frederick , ' I told him , polite but final . Now go away and never come up these stairs again . ' Now , Bertha , ' he began , in that wheedling , sugary tone he knows how to put on when there is a woman in question . But I cut him off quick . I told you to go away , ' I said , ' I wash my hands of you . I have stood enough . Do n't waste your time trying , ' I said . This door is locked . ' And I closed it in his face , not slammingit , because I would n't give that woman the pleasure of knowing I was angry , but sharp and definite . I heard regretful whispering on the other side for a minute or two and then they shuffled off and I went to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bell and he called through the door , ' I 'm alone now , Bertha , let me in for the love of God , ' but I made not a move and I said not a word . He rang the bell all the night long and whimpered outside the door , but my decision was made and I did n't let him know , even by a whisper , that I so much as heard a sound . And in the end , with the sun coming up , he gave a last , despairing ring , and he called , I 'm going , Bertha , it 's goodbyeforever ' and even though my heart fell down inside me like a weight , I did n't answer him , because it 's about time he was taught a lesson . And that , " Mrs. Mull said , " is the end of your father . " Clarice started to tell her mother that she ought to give him one more chance , but she gave up when she saw the set of Mrs. Mull 's jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm her as best she could and watched her put on her hat , squarely on her head , like a soldier putting on his helmet before a battle , and descend the stairs to do her days ' shopping , implacable and alone.  |p117Clarice  thought all day about her mother and about how the love she bore her father could burn so fiercely for forty years that she could find the strength to turn him away from her door , even though he had been dead so long , because of a kiss on a porch in Croton Falls in 1921 . And when Mr. Smalley came home that night , she looked at him coldly and knew , as he took off his shoes and sat down mildly and faithfully in an easy chair , putting on his glasses to read the evening newspaper , that he never could inspire such passion in any woman , and that ten days after he had been lowered into his grave she would not be able to remember even his most obnoxious mannerism . " Ah , " he said wearily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been busy today . " Clarice looked at him for a long , bitter moment . " Doing what ? " she asked . " Cheating the poor and doing sad souls that have been destroyed by fire out of their rightful damages ? " " Clarice . . . " Mr. Smalley said , looking up from his newspaper , frightened and surprised , sensing a new , disturbing note of passion in the marriage that he knew would never be to his advantage . " What have I done ? " But Clarice did not answer . She was putting on her coat , and she was out of the apartment , without a word , on her way to a saloon on Third Avenue , not far from the Bloomingdalecorner.  |p118MUNNIE  BROOKS WAS AWAKENED BY THE SOUND OF TWO SHOTSoutside the window . He opened his eyes and looked at the ceiling . By the quality of the light , even through the drawn curtains , he could tell that it was sunny outside . He turned his head . In the other bed Bert was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in control of his dreams . Munniegot out of his bed and , barefooted , in his pajamas , went over to the window and parted the curtains . The last mists of morning were curling up from the fields , and far off and below , the sea was smooth in the October sunlight . In the distance , along the curve of the coast , the Pyrenees banked back in green ridges toward a soft sky . From behind a haystack more than a hundred yards away , beyond the edge of the hotel terrace , a hunter and his dog appeared , walking slowly , the hunter reloading . Watching him , Munnie remembered , with mild , gluttonous pleasure , that he had had partridge , newlyp119killed and plump with the summer 's feeding , for dinner the night before . The hunter was an old man , dressed in fisherman 's blue and wearing fisherman 's rubber boots . He moved solidly and carefully behind his dog , through the cut stubble . When I am an old man , thought Munnie , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an October morning . He opened the curtains wider and looked at his watch . It was after ten o'clock . They had been up late the night before , all three of them , at the casino in Biarritz . Earlier in the summer , when they had been on the Cote d'Azur . a paratroop lieutenant on leave had showed them a foolproofsystem for beating the roulette table , and whenever they could , they frequented casinos . The system took a lot of capital and they had never made more than 8000 francs in one night among them on it , and sometimes it meant sitting up till three o'clock in the morning following the wheel , but they had n't lost yet , either , since they met the lieutenant . It had made their trip unexpectedly luxurious , especially when they got to places where there was a casino . The system ignored the numbers and concentrated on the red and the black and involved a rather complicated rhythm of doubling . The night before they had won only 4500 francs and it had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the weather clear and an old man hunting birds outside your window , the thousand-franc notes on the dresser added a fillip of luck and complacency to the morning . Standing there , feeling the sun warm on his bare feet and smelling the salt and hearing the distant calm mutter of the surf , remembering the partridge and the gamblingp120and everything else about the summer that had just passed , Munnie knew he did n't want to start home that morning as they had planned . Staring down at the hunter following his dog slowly across the brown field on the edge of the sea , Munnie knew that when he was older he would look back upon the summer and think , Ah , it was wonderful when I was young . This double ability to enjoy a moment with the immediacy of youth and the reflective melancholy of age had made Bert say to him , half seriously , half as a joke , " I envy you , Munnie . You have a rare gift  --  the gift of instantaneous nostalgia . You get twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its drawbacks . It made moving away from places he liked difficult for Munnie and packed all endings and farewells with emotion , because the old man who travelled within him was always saying , in his autumnal whisper , It will never be like that again . But putting an end to this long summer , which had stretched into October , was going to be more painful than any other finish or departure that Munnie had known . These were the last days of the last real holiday of his life , Munnie felt . The trip to Europe had been a gift from his parents upon his graduation from college and now when he went back , there they would all be on the dock , the kind , welcoming , demanding faces , expecting him to get to work , asking him what he intended to do , offering him jobs and advice , settling him lovingly and implacably into the rut of being a grownup and responsible and tethered adult . From now on all holidays would be provisional , hurried interludes of gulped summertime between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said the old man within . The boat docks in seven days.  |p121Munnie  turned and looked at his sleeping friend . Bert slept tranquilly , extended and composed under his blankets , his sunburned long thin nose geometrically straight in the air . This would change , too , Munnie thought . After the boat docked they would never be as close again . Never as close as on the rocks over the sea in Sicily or climbing through the sunny ruins at Paestum or chasing the two English girls through the Roman nightclubs . Never as close as the rainy afternoon in Florence when they talked , together , for the first time , to Martha . Never as close as on the long , winding journey , the three of them packed into the small open car , up the Ligurian coast toward the border , stopping whenever they felt like it for white wine or a swim at the little beach pavilions with all the small , brightly colored pennants whipping out in the hot Mediterraneanafternoon . Never as close as the conspiratorial moment over the beers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juan-les-Pins , learning about the unbeatable system . Never as close as in the lavender , hilarious dawns , driving back to their hotel gloating over their winnings , with Martha dozing between them . Never as close as on the blazing afternoon at Barcelona , sitting high up on the sunny side , sweating and cheering and shading their eyes as the matador walked around the ring holding up the two bull 's ears , with the flowers and the wineskins sailing down around him . Never as close as at Salamanca and Madrid and on the road through the straw-colored , hot , bare countryup to France , drinking sweet , raw Spanish brandy and trying to remember how the music went that the gypsies danced to in the caves . Never so close , again , finally , as here in this small whitewashed Basque hotel room , with Bert still asleep , and Munnie standing at the window watch/ing the old man disappear with his dog and his shotgun , and upstairs in the room above them , Martha , sleeping , as she always did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they always did , together , as though they did n't trust themselves or each other to do it alone , to wake her and tell her what they planned to do for the day . Munnie threw the curtains wide open and let the sun stream in . If there 's one boat that I have a right to miss in my life , he thought , it 's the one that 's sailing from Le Havre the day after tomorrow . Munnie went over to Bert 's bed , stepping carefully over the clothes that were crumpled on the floor . He poked Bert 's bare shoulder with his finger . " Master , " he said , " rise and shine . " The rule was that whoever lost in tennis between them had to call the other Master for twenty-four hours . Bert had won the day before 6-3 , 2-6 , 7-5 . " It 's after ten . " Munnie poked him again . Bert opened both eyes and stared coldly at the ceiling . " Do I have a hangover ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us for dinner , " said Munnie , " and two beers after . " " I do not have a hangover , " Bert said , as if the news depressed him . " But it 's raining outside . " " It 's a bright , hot sunny morning , " Munnie said . " Everybody always told me it rained all the time on the Basque coast , " said Bert , lying still , complaining . " Everybody is a liar , " Munnie said . " Get the hell out of bed . " Bert swung his legs slowly over the side of the bed and sat there , thin , bony and bare from the waist up , in his pajama pants that were too short for him and from which his big feet dangled loosely . " Do you know why Americanp123women live longer than American men , Fat Man ? " he asked , squinting at Munnie in the sunlight . " No . " " Because they sleep in the morning . My ambition , " Bert said , lying back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side , " is to live as long as the American Woman . " Munnie lit a cigarette and tossed one to Bert , who managed to light it without lifting his head from the blanket . " I had an idea , " Munnie said , " while you were wasting the precious hours of your childhood sleeping . " " Put it in the suggestion box . " Bert yawned and closed his eyes . " The management will give a buffalo-hide saddle to every employee who presents us with an idea that is put into practice by the ... " " Listen , " Munnie said eagerly . " I think we ought to miss that damned boat . " Bert smoked in silence for a moment , narrowing his eyes and pointing his nose at the ceiling . " Some people , " he said , " are born boat-missers and train-missers and planemissers . My mother , for example . She once saved herself from getting killed by ordering a second dessert at lunch . The plane left just as she got to the field and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single survivor . It was ice-cream , with crushed fresh strawberries ... " " Come on , Bert . " Sometimes Munnie got very impatient with Bert 's habit of going off on tangents while he was making up his mind . " I know all about your mother . " " In the springtime , " Bert said , " she goes mad for strawberries . Tell me , Munnie , have you ever missed anything in your life ? " " No , " Munnie said.  | " Do you think it 's wise , " Bert asked , " at this late stage , to fiddle with the patterns of a lifetime ? " Munnie went into the bathroom and filled a glass with water . When he came back into the bedroom , Bert was still lying on the bed , his legs dangling over the side , smoking . Munnie stood over him , then slowly tipped the glass over Bert 's bare brown chest . The water splashed a little and ran in thin trickles over Bert 's ribs onto the sheets . " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They both laughed and Bert sat up . " All right , Fat Man , " Bert said . " I did n't know you were serious . " " My idea , " said Munnie , " is to stay here until the weather changes . It 's too sunny to go home . " " What 'll we do about the tickets ? " " We 'll send a telegram to the boat people and tell them we 'll take passage later . They 've got a waiting list a mile long . They 'll be delighted . " Bert nodded judiciously . " What about Martha ? " he asked . " Maybe she has to get to Paris today . " " Martha does n't have to go anyplace . Anytime , " Munnie said . " You know that . " Bert nodded again . " The luckiest girl in the world , " he said . Outside the window there was the sound of the shotgun again . Bert turned his head , listening . There was a second report . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth , " that was wonderful partridge last night . " He stood up , looking , in his flapping pajama pants like a boy who would be a good prospect for the college crew if he could be induced to eat heavily for a year . He had been chubby until he went into the Army , but by the time he got out inp125May , he was long and stringy and his ribs showed . When she wanted to make fun of him , Martha told him he looked like an English poet in his bathing trunks . He went to the window and Munnie crossed over and stood beside him , looking out over the mountains and the sea and the sunlight . " You 're right , " Bert said . " Only an idiot would dream of starting home on a day like this . Let 's go tell Martha the party 's still on . " They dressed quickly , in espadrilles and cotton trousers and tennis shirts and went upstairs together and into Martha 's room , without knocking . The wind was making one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still asleep , curled around herself , only the top of her head showing above the blanket , the hair dark and tangled and short . The pillow was on the floor . Munnie and Bert stood in silence for a moment , looking down at the curled , blanketed figure and the dark head , each of them convinced that the other did not know what he was thinking . " Awake , " Bert said softly . " Awake to glory . " He went over to the bed and touched the top of Martha 's head . Watching him , Munnie could feel the tips of his own fingers twitching electrically . " Please , " Martha said , her eyes still closed . " It 's the middle of the night . " " It 's nearly noon , " Munnie said , lying by nearly two hours , " and we have to tell you something . " " Tell it to me , " said Martha , " and get out of here . " " The Fat Man here , " said Bert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an idea . He wants us to stay here until it begins to rain . How do you feel about it ? "  | " Of course , " Martha said . Bert and Munnie smiled at each other , because they felt they understood her so well . " Martha , " said Bert , " you 're the only perfect girl alive . " Then they went out of the room to give her a chance to get dressed . They had met Martha Holm in Florence . They seemed to have the same ideas about which museums and which churches to go to and they kept bumping into her and she was alone and obviously American and as Bert said , they did n't come prettier , and finally they started talking to each other . Maybe it was because they had first seen her in the Uffizi Gallery among the Botticellis that gave Munniethe idea , but he thought , privately , that , aside from the fact that her hair was short and dark and irregularly cut , she looked like the Primavera , tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose and deep , brooding , dangerous eyes . He felt extravagant and embarrassed to be thinking things like this about a twenty-one-year-old American girl who wore slacks and had gone for a year to Smith , but he could n't help himself . He never told Martha about it and , of course he never said a word on the subject to Bert . Martha knew a lot of people in and around Florence ( later on , it turned out that she knew a lot of people in and around everyplace ) and she got them invited to a tea in Fiesole at a villa where there was a swimming pool and to a party at which Munnie found himself dancing with a Contessa . Martha had been in Europe for nearly two years and she was wonderful at telling you what places to go to and what places were traps , and she spoke Italian and French , and she was ready when you told her to be ready ,  |p127and  she did n't scream for pity when she had to walk a few blocks on her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munnie 's jokes and made some of her own , and she did n't giggle , weep or sulk , which put her several notches above every other girl Munnie had ever known . After they had been together for three days in Florence and were due to start for Portofino and France , it seemed unbearable just to leave her behind . As far as Munnie and Bert could tell , she had no plans of her own . " I tell my mother , " Martha explained , " that I 'm taking courses at the Sorbonne , and it 's almost true , at least in the wintertime . " Martha 's mother lived in Philadelphia , after three divorces , and every once in awhile , Martha said , she sent back a photograph , so that when she finally did arrive back home , there would n't be an embarrassing moment on the dock when her mother would n't recognize her . So Munnie and Bert talked it over very seriously and sat at a cafe table with Martha in the Piazza del Signoria and ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've decided , " Bert said , with Munnie sitting beside him , silently agreeing , " is that the Brooks-Carboy unguided tour of Europe could use you , as interpreter , hotel-finder , and chief taster of foreign foods . Aside from supplying a welcome feminine touch . Are you interested ? " " Yes , " Martha said . " We 'd like to know if we could mesh schedules , more or less , " Munnie said . Martha smiled . " I 'm on a schedule of drift , " she said . " Did n't you know ? " " Does that mean , " Munnie asked , because he liked to have everything absolutely clear , " that you want to come along ? "  | " It means that I want to come along very much , " said Martha , " and I was hoping you 'd ask me . " She looked at each of them for exactly the same number of seconds , cheerful , grateful , ready for anything . " Now , " said Bert , " Munnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lay it on the line . Something like this has to be planned out in advance or there comes a dark and hideous night of disaster . We 've thought up a good , workable set of rules and if you agree , off we go tomorrow . If not  --  no harm done  --  and we hope you spend a pleasant summer . " " Get to it , Bert , " Munnie said , impatiently . " Do n't recite the preamble to the Constitution . " " Rule Number One , " Bert said , with Martha sitting still , nodding , gravely listening , " rule number one is basic . No entanglements . Munnie and I 're old friends and we 've planned this summer for years and we 've been having a wonderful time and we do n't want to wind up fighting duels with each other or anything like that . Now , I know women . . . " He paused , daring either of them to smile . They did n't smile . " He would n't have said that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you know about women ? " Martha asked , being serious . " What I know is that women 're always busy choosing , " Bert went on . " They come into a room and if there 're five men present , their minds get to work like a business machine , punching holes . First Choice , Second Choice , Acceptable , Perhaps , Impossible . " " Oh , my . " Martha began to laugh . She covered herp129mouth with her hand apologetically and tried to straighten her face . " Forgive me . Munnie ... do you believe this ? " " I do n't know , " he said embarrassedly . " I have n't had Bert 's advantages . I was n't in the Army . " " I 'll even tell you how you 'd choose , " Bert said , " betweenMunnie and me , so you wo n't have to wonder or waste your time . " " Tell me , " Martha said . " Do tell me . " " In the beginning , " said Bert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go into the reasons some other time . Then , after awhile , the switch sets in , and Munnie gets the final decision . " " Poor Bert , " Martha said , chuckling . " How awful for you ! Only winning the opening game of the season all the time . Why are you telling me all this ? " " Because you 've got to promise not to choose anybody , " Bert said . " And if you do choose , you have to go to the grave with your secret . " " To the grave , " Martha repeated , trying to be solemn . " Until the boat sails , " Bert said , " we treat each otherlike brothers and sister , and that 's all . D'accord ? " " D'accord , " Martha said . " Good . " Bert and Munnie nodded at each other , pleased with how reasonable everybody was . " Rule Number Two , " Bert said , " if after awhile we get to feel you 're a nuisance  --  we say farewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No scenes . Just a friendly shake of the hand and off to the nearest railroad station . D'accord ? " " D'accord two times , " Martha said . " Rule Number Three  --  everybody pays exactly one third of the expenses . "  | " Of course , " said Martha . " Rule Number Four , " Bert went on , like the director of a company explaining a plan of operations to his board , " everybody is free to go wherever he or she wants to , and with anyone else whoever , and no questions asked . We are not an inseparable unit , because inseparable units are boring . O. K. ? " " A free , loose confederation of sovereign states , " Martha said . " I got it . Whomever . " They all shook hands on it , surrounded by the looming oversized statues , and started out together early the next morning , after figuring out a way to squeeze Martha into the car and strap her baggage onto the back , and it all could n't have worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all summer , although they had discussed , among other things , sex , religion , politics , marriage , the choice of careers , the position of women in modern society , the theatre in New York and Paris , and the proper size of bathing costumes for young girls on the beaches of Italy , France and Spain . And when Bert had taken up with a plump little blonde American girl in St. Tropez for a week or so , it had n't seemed to disturb Martha for a minute , even when the girl moved into the hotel they were staying at and frankly installed herself in the room next to Munnie 's and Bert 's . The truth was , nothing seemed to disturb Martha very much . She greeted the events of each day with a strange and almost dreamlike placidity . She seemed to make no decisions herself and whatever decisions the others made , regardless of how they turned out , she accepted with exactly the same good-natured , smiling , rather vague approval . Linked in Munnie 's mind with this pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in to awaken her in the morning , she would sleep on till noon , till two o'clock in the afternoon , even if she had gone to bed early the evening before . It was n't anything physical , either , because she did n't need the sleep and never suggested , herself , that it was time to go to bed , no matter how late they stayed up at night or at what hour she had arisen in the morning . She never wrote any letters and rarely received any , since she hardly ever remembered to leave a forwarding address when they moved . When she needed money she would wire the bank in Paris that handled her allowance , and when it came she spent it carelessly . She took almost no interest in clothes and the reason she cut her hair short the way she did , she told Bert and Munnie , was that she did n't want to be bothered having to comb it all the time . When the three of them talked about what they would like to do with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , " she said , shrugging , smiling , seeming to be mildly and indulgently puzzled about herself . " I suppose I 'll just hang around . Wait and see . For the moment , I 'm on a policy of float . I do n't see anybody else our age doing anything so damned attractive . I 'm waiting for a revelation to send me in a pet nianent direction . I 'm in no hurry to commit myself , no hurry at all . . . " In a curious way , Martha 's lack of direction made her much more interesting to Munnie than all the other girls he had ever known , the positive but limited girls who knew they wanted to be married and have babies and join a country club , the girls who wanted to go on the stage and be famous , the girls who wanted to become editors or deans of women 's colleges . Martha had n't settledp132for anything yet , Munnie felt , because nothing good enough had come up . And there was always the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commit herself it would be for something huge , original and glorious . The only way that the plans had n't worked out as outlinedin Florence had been that , except for the week of the plump blonde in St. Tropez , they had been an inseparableunit , but that was only because all three of them enjoyedbeing with one another better than being with anyone else . It would n't have worked if Martha had been a different kind of girl , if she had been a coquette or greedy or foolish , and it would n't have worked if Munnie and Bert had n't been such good friends and had n't trusted each other so completely , and finally , it would n't have worked if they had all been a little older . But it had worked , at least up until the first week of October , and with luck , it would continue to work , until they kissed Martha goodbye and got on the boat train , and started for home . They lay on the deserted beach until nearly two o'clock and then took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cold , and it was the best way to keep warm . The race was a short one , only about fifty yards , and Munnie was completely out of breath by the time he finished , trying to keep up with Martha . Martha won easily and was floating serenely on her back when Munnie came up to her , blowingheavily and fighting to get air in his lungs . " It would be a different story , " Munnie said , grinning , but a little ashamed , " if I did n't have asthma . " " Do n't be gloomy about it , " Martha said , kicking her legs gently . " Women 're more naturally buoyant . " They both stood up and watched Bert plowing doggedly up toward them.  | " Bert , " Martha said , as he reached them and stopped , " you 're the only man I know who looks like an old lady driving an electric automobile when he swims . " " My talents , " said Bert , with dignity , " run in another direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cold water and waving their arms . They dressed on the beach , under the big towel , one after another , for modesty 's sake . Martha wore slacks that came down only to the middle of her calf and a fisherman 's jersey , striped blue and white . Watching her arrange her clothes with light , careless movements , Munnie felt that never in his life would he see again anything so gay and obscurely touching as Martha Holm , dressed in a sailor 's striped shirt , on a sunny beach , shaking the sea water out of her short , dark hair . They decided to have a picnic rather than to go to a restaurant for lunch and they got into the little two-seater MG that Munnie 's brother had left for him , when he had had his summer in Europe the year before . With Martha sitting on the cushioned brake in the middle they went into town and bought a cold chicken and a long loaf of bread and a piece of Gruyere cheese . They borrowed a basket from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blue grapes and picked up two bottles of pink wine and got back into the car and drove all around the harbor to the old fort , which had been besieged and which had fallen at other times but which was used now in the summertime as a school to teach young people how to sail . They parked the car and walked out along the broad , bleached top of the sea wall , carrying the basket and the wine and the big , slightly damp towel , to serve as a tablecloth . From the wall they could see the wide stretch of the oval harbor , empty now except for a dory with a homemadep134sail heading toward the point of Saint Barbe , and the deserted beach and the white and red buildings of Saint Jean de Luz . The boatyard near the fort was crammed with small blue Snipe-class boats , lashed down and on blocks for the winter , and from somewhere in the distance came the faint sound of hammering , lonely and out-of-season , where a single workman was putting new planks into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , almost lost against the gray-blue wash of the horizon , the boats of the tuna fleet bobbed in the swell . The tide was out and the waves rolled in , white and spumy , but not ominous , over the slanting uncovered rocks on which the sea wall was built . Close to the wall , on the bay side , the ruined , circular bastions of the old wall , which the sea had broken in anothercentury , loomed out of the quiet water , irregular , crumbling , useless , looking somehow Roman and remindingMunnie of aqueducts that had brought mountain water to cities that had long since vanished and dungeons in which the last prisoners had died five hundred years before . They did n't go all the way out to the end of the wall , which was separated from the middle section of the breakwaterby a wide channel through which the shipping entered and left the harbor . Even on the calmest day , Munnie felt something wild and dangerous out there on the flat point of stone , where the full force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guarded waters of the bay and the land beyond . Munnie suffered a little from vertigo and when he looked down the sheer sides of the wall into the shifting green depths and the fringe of foam he had a helpless picture of himself caught there below , or plunging down to fight against the tides and the rocks andp135the waves coming and going and crossing each other with upcurling tips of spray . He did n't say anything about it , of course , but he was grateful when Martha said , " This is good enough , " before they had gone very far , and he carefullyhelped weight the towel down as a tablecloth squarely in the middle of the wall . There was a little wind , capricious and sporadically chilly , but Bert took off his shirt , to maintain his tan . Munnie , who had a soft , rather full growth of fuzzy reddish hair on his chest , and who was embarrassed by it , said that the wind was too cold for undressing . Bert glanced at him ironically , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't say anything . As Martha cut up the chicken and arranged the cheese and bread and grapes on pieces of paper in the center of the towel , where they could all get at them neatly , Bert cocked his head , listening to the distant , slow , rhythmic hammering from the boatyard . " Whenever I hear that noise in a place like this , " he said , " it reminds me of the end of The Cherry Orchard . Evertyhing melancholy and closed up and ready to die and the autumn setting in . . . " " Whenever I hear it , " Martha said , arranging the grapes , " I think , Divorce , divorce . ' " " That 's the difference , " said Bert , " between Russia and America . " He walked over to the edge of the wall and stood there , his toes dangerously over the brink , staring out at the horizon , a tall , spare , loose-limbed figure , reciting , his arms ritually upraised , " Break , break , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , And I would that my heart could utter , The thoughts that arise in me ... " " Lunch is on , " Martha said , sitting cross-legged and pushing her sleeves above the elbows , her bare arms , underp136the bunched jersey , brown and surprisingly full and solid for such a slender girl . She took a piece of chicken and bit into it and said , " It 's the only kind of picnic that makes picnics worth while . And no ants . " Munnie drank some of the wine from the bottle , because they had neglected to bring glasses , and broke a piece of bread off the long loaf and took some of the dark meat . Bert sat on the other side of Martha , folding his long legs down in slow motion . He reached for a piece of chicken , and said , as he munched at it , " Do you think a bright , sober young American would make a fortune setting up a factory in France to manufacture paper plates and paper cups ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha said . " Oh , that old , lowdown , ineffable , medieval , greasypapercharm , " Bert said . " Trust a woman to notice things like that , eh , Munnie ? " He lifted his eyebrow in an exaggerated , theatrical leer . " God , is n't it lucky we walked into that gallery in Florence and found Martha ? Otherwise , you know what our summer would 've been like ? We 'd have been delivered over to all the female riffraff of Europe  --  allthose Italian movie starlets , bursting out of their shirtwaists , all those skinny French models , all those hungry-eyed , golden-brown American divorcees , smelling from Arpege . God , Munnie , does n't it make you feel as though Something was watching over you that day in the museum ? Tell me the truth , Fat Man , does n't it make you feel supernaturally serene ? " " Where did you ever learn to talk like that ? " Martha asked , sitting cross-legged , placidly lifting the wine bottle to her lips.  | " My grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bert said , " and he taught me to fear the Lord , read the Bible , relish corn , and speak in balanced sentences . " He stood up and waved the drumstick of the chicken at the Atlantic Ocean . " Repent , ye sinners , becauseye have swum in the warm waters , and ogled the virgins . . . " He made a bow in Martha 's direction . " And ye have played at the tables and ye have neglected to send postcards home . Repent , because ye have found pleasure and ye have missed the boat . " " Do you want some cheese ? " Martha asked . " With mustard . " Bert sat down again . He peered thoughtfully at Munnie . " What do you think , Munnie ? " he asked . " Are we really as happy as we feel or do we only think we 're this happy ? The philosopher 's everlasting cud  --  illusion or reality . Is this wall stone ? " he demanded oratorically . " Is this ocean blue , this water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have in our pockets or is it really coupons for prizes that were given away in Duluth in 1922 by a tobacco company that went bankrupt the first Thursday after the crash ? Is this the good wine of France we 're drinking or is it vinegar spiked with blood and seawater ? Rose de Beam , " he said , reading the label on the bottle . " It seems real , does n't it , but is it ? Are we three over-privileged , white-toothed , splendid young Americanprinces , visiting our greatest colony , or are we , without knowing it , pitiful refugees , in flight , with our backs to the sea ? . . . Have you read a newspaper this morning , do you know the answer ? Are we friends and brothers , or will we betray each other by sunset ? Search the lady for daggers . " " Holy man , " Martha said , " the self-starter got loose . "  |p138Munnie  smiled dreamily , in appreciation of Bert 's performance . He himself was literal and direct and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was entertained by Bert 's flights of rhetoric and appreciated Bert much the way a man with no talent , but a love for music , appreciates a friend who is a skillful pianist and who generously performs at just the right moments , without being asked . It went all the way back to the time when they were both sixteen and in school together and Bert used to make scandalous improvisations in blank verse about the assumed sexual habits of the middle-aged and slightly bald lady who taught them chemistry . It got Bert into trouble from time to time because he was recklessly brave and once he started he let himself be carried away and say outrageous things , no matter who was listening . Just this summer , they had had to fight four young Germans in a brasserie in Nice and run from the police because of one of his performances . Bert had struck up a conversation with the young men and asked them where they came from and they had said , after a little hesitation , that they were Swiss . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dusseldorf ? Hamburg ? " The Germans , who were large , solid men , had looked uncomfortable and turned away from him toward the beers that were standing on the bar in front of them , but Bert would n't leave it alone . " The part of Switzerland I find most charming , " Bert said loudly , " is Belsen . So rural , so cosy , so full of memories . What I always have said is that Switzerland would have won the war if it had n't been stabbed in the back by the watchmakers . And a good thing , too . " " Cut it out , " Munnie had whispered , and Martha hadp137shaken her head warningly too , and pulled at Bert 's arm . " There 're four of them . They 'll murder us . " But Bert had gone right on . " I 'm proud to tell you gentlemen , " he had said , smiling broadly , " that I have always been a believer in a Greater Switzerland and there are plenty of good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Germans were muttering among themselves by now and Munnie took off his watch and slipped it into his pocket because he did n't want it broken when the fight began . " Shut up , Bert , " Martha said . " They 're going to hit you with a beermug . " " Now , boys , " Bert went on , lifting his glass , " I 'd like you to join me in a toast to the greatest little old Swiss of them all , that kindly , sweet old lovable fellow , Adolf Hitler , and after that we 'll all join in singing Switzerland Uber Alles . I 'm sure you know the words ... " Munnie had edged around by now and when the first German swung , he grabbed the man 's arm and clubbed him twice with his right hand . The Germans were slow , but strong , and very angry , and by the time Munnie dragged Bert to the door , he had a bloody nose and Bert 's coat collar was half torn off and all the waiters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran through the back streets of Nice , hearing confused shouting dying down behind them . Bert was chuckling as he ran , and shaking his right hand , which was numb from a German skull , and he kept saying to Munnie , " What part of Switzerland you from , Bud ? Leipzig ? Nuremberg ? " A half hour later , when they were sitting safely in a bar along the Promenade des Anglais , it had begun to seemp140funny to Martha and Munnie , too , and for the rest of the summer , whenever any one of them did something that seemed objectionable or foolish , the others would ask , incredulously , " What part of Switzerland are you from ? " Now Bert was sitting , waving the wine bottle gently , beaming out at the bay . " I think I am going to start a new kind of travel service . Out-of-season tours to slightly rundownresorts . I 'll write a brochure , entitled Know bliss ! Be Unfashionable ! Get Away from Your Fellow Man on Your Next Vacation ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the dough to get us started , Munnie ? " Bert had an unshakable belief that Munnie 's father was enormously wealthy and avid for unusual business opportunities , which Bert was happy to find for him . The opportunities had included the planting of an avocado grove near Grasse , and the building of a 4000-foot telepheriquefor skiing in a village of twenty-two houses in the Spanish Pyrenees . All of Bert 's projects , aside from involvinggreat outlays of capital on the part of Munnie 's father , also included the necessity of Bert 's remaining permanently in Europe as manager . " Munnie , " Bert said , " do n't you think we ought to send your father a cable ? " " No , " said Munnie . " The chance of a lifetime , " Bert said . " What does he want to hold onto all that money for ? The inheritance people 'll just take it from him in the hideous end . Well , I 'll find something . That 's not the only way to turn a dollar . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grapes by now . " Martha , " he said , " do you know that you represent a source of vast potential income ? "  | " I 'm going to donate my body to science , " Martha said , " at the age of eighty-five . " " The essential thing , " said Bert , " is not to marry an American . " " Report that man to a committee , " Martha said . " America is not the place for a pretty woman , " Bert went on . " The houses 're getting too small , the help too expensive , a beauty suddenly finds herself in a cosy little nest in Scarsdale surrounded by television sets and laborsavingdevices and invitations to join the Parent-Teachers Association . A beautiful woman does better in a country which is decaying a little , and rather uneconomically run  --  like France . You could marry a nice forty-five-year-old man with a clean mustache and large , rolling feudal estates on the banks of the Loire . Wonderful shooting in the autumn and good , light wines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their caps and bowing when the station wagon went by . Your husband would adore you and invite all your friends down to keep you happy and he 'd leave you alone a good deal of the time when he went up to Paris to attend to his affairs and have his doctor probe his liver . " " Where do you fit into this picture ? " Martha asked . " He 'd be one of the friends invited to keep you happy , " Munnie said . He was n't enjoying the conversation . Even though Bert was joking , Munnie knew that actually Bert would approve if Martha did go out and marry an old man with a lot of money . Just the other day , when they had been talking about the careers that might lie ahead of them , Bert had said , " The important thing is to recognize your gift and then use it . And the best way to use it is to keep you from the insufferable boredom of work . Nowp140your gift  --  " he had grinned at Martha " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You use it on a man and the sky 's the limit . My gift is a double one , but in the long run less hopeful . I have charm . . . " He grinned more widely , making fun of himself , " and I do n't give a damn . Still , if I 'm clever enough and do n't rise to the wrong bait , I may go a long way on it . As for Munnie ... " He shook his head doubtfully . " His gift is virtue . Poor sod . What can he do with that ? " Now , sitting on the corner of the towel , picking the grapes appreciatively off their stems , one by one , Bert was shaking his head . " No , " he said , " I wo n't be one of the invited friends . I 'm a permanent fixture . I 'm the overseer of the estates , the curious American with no ambition who likes to live in France on the banks of the pretty river . I walk around in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new wine barrels , loved by one and all , making wry comments on the state of the world , playing backgammonin front of the fire with the mistress of the house when her husband is away , and going up the stairs later , with the last glass of Armagnac in my hand , to entertain her in my wry , American way in the ancestral bed ... " " Ah , " Martha said , " how idyllic ! " " Every age , " Bert said gravely , " to its own particular idyll . This is this year , among the wars . " Munnie felt very uncomfortable and when he looked over at Martha he felt even more uncomfortable , because she was laughing . They had laughed together at a lot of things since Florence , and they had covered all the subjects , but Munnie did n't want to hear Martha laughing now at this . He stood up . " I think I 'm going down the wall a way , "  |p141he  said , " and take a siesta . Wake me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty yards , carrying a sweater to use as a pillow , and as he stretched out on the smooth sunwarmedstone , he heard Martha and Bert laughing together , the laughter private and small in the wide , bright emptiness . Closing his eyes against the glare of the sun , listening to the distant laughter , Munnie realized that he was in pain . The pain was not localized and it had a curious , evasive quality . Just when Munnie felt , There , I 've got it , it 's in my throat , it slipped away , not to disappear , but to put vague , sharp , almost detectable fingers somewhere else . Then , lying there , with the curtain of heat on his eyelids , Munnie understood that what he was feeling was not pain , but sorrow . The sorrow was deep and complex , and was composed of many elements  --  a sense of deprivation , a shadow of impendingdeparture , a nostalgia for memories that were moving irrevocably away from innocence , a confusion of emotion more profound than anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaken as he was , Munnie also knew that if , telepathically affected , Martha would stop laughing with Bert and get up and walk the thirty yards along the wall to where he lay , and if she were to sit down beside him and touch his hand , all would instantaneously be well . But she did n't move , and he heard her laugh more loudly at something that Bert had said and which Munnie could n't hear . Suddenly , Munnie knew what he was going to do . As soon as he was on the boat , and all bargains were over , all rules no longer in effect , he was going to write Martha andp142ask her to marry him . Clumsily , he began to compose the letter in his mind . This will come as a surprise to you , I suppose , because all summer long I never said a word , but I did n't realize for a long time what had been happening to me , and besides there was the arrangement you and Bert and I made in Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am happy we did . But now I 'm on the boat and I feel free to tell you how I feel about you . I love you and I want to marry you . I do n't know how you feel about me , but maybe the arrangement kept you from saying anything , just the way it did me . Anyway , I hope so . I am going to get a job and get settled just as soon as I get home , and then you could come back and meet my family and all that . . . " The letter stopped writing itself inside his head . He thought of his mother sitting down having tea with Martha , saying , " You say your mother lives in Philadelphia ? And your father . . . oh . . . Do try one of these cakes . And you say you met Munnie in Florence and then just you and he and Bert went all around Europe for the rest of the summerall together . . . Lemon , cream ? " Munnie shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . He went back to writing the imaginary letter . You said once that you did n't know what you wanted to do with yourself , that you were waiting for some kind of revelation to send you in a permanent direction . Maybe you 'll laugh at me for offering myself as a revelation , but maybe you 'll feel that marrying me will .. . Munnie shook his head disgustedly . God , even if she was crazy in love with him , he thought , a sentence like that would queer it forever.  |p143I  do n't know about you and other men , he went on jumpily in his head . You never seemed interested in anybody else while you were with us and you never mentioned anybody else in any particular way and as far as I could tell you never showed any preference between Bert and me ... Munnie opened his eyes and turned his head to look at Bert and Martha . They were sitting close together , almost head to head , facing each other , talking in low , serious voices . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have charm and I do n't give a damn . Well , Munnie thought , with satisfaction , even if she overlooked the egotism , that ca n't have attracted her so much . And besides , there was that open and avowed blonde in St. Tropez . If Bert had planned to do anything with Martha , or if Martha , as Bert had predicted , was interested in making a choice , that certainly would have put an end to it , would n't it ? Bert , Munnie decided , could be the amusing , bachelor friend of the family . The best kind . Munnie dozed a little , a succession of warm and deliciousimages pouring through his mind . Martha coming off the airplane at Idlewild , because after getting his letter the boat was too slow , and walking away from the runway into his arms . Martha and he waking late on a Sunday morning in their own apartment and deciding to doze for another hour and then go out to breakfast . Martha coming into a party on his arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room for a moment , because she was so beautiful . Martha .. . Someone was shouting . Far off , someone was shouting.  |p144Munnie  opened his eyes and blinked , thinking , puzzled . Now , why did anyone shout in my dream ? The cry came again and Munnie stood up and looked out at the bay . In the water , at least three hundred yards away , was a small boat . It was the dory they had seen before . It had capsized and it was low in the water and there were two figures clinging to it . As he watched , he heard the cry again , wordless , desperate . A hand and arm flashed in the sunlight , waving . Munnie turned and looked over at Bert and Martha . They were stretched out , their heads together on the towel , their bodies making a wide V , sleeping . " Bert ! " Munnie called . " Martha ! Get up ! " Bert stirred , then sat up , rubbing his eyes . The shout came again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Munnie said , pointing . Bert swung around , still sitting , and looked at the capsized boat and the two almost-submerged figures clinging to it , a man and a woman . " Good God , " Bert said . " What do they think they 're doing there ? " He nudged Martha . " Wake up , " he said , " and watch the shipwreck . " The boat lay almost motionless in the water , only shiftinga little as the two figures moved , changing their positions . As Munnie watched , he saw the man push off from the boat and start to swim toward the beach . The man swam slowly and every thirty seconds he stopped and shouted and waved . After each stop he slid under , then reappeared , splashing and frantic . " Oh , my , " Bert said . " He 's leaving her out there ! " Bert was standing by now , with Martha at his side , peering across the bay . The man had a good three hundred yards to go before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving and going under twice a minute , it did n't look as though he was going to make it . The woman who had been left hanging onto the boat shouted from time to time , too , and her voice sounded shrill and angry as it floated across the glittering quiet water . Finally , Munnie could make out what the swimmer was shouting . " Au secours ! Je noye , je noye ! " Munnie felt a little flicker of annoyance with him . It seemed melodramaticand overdone to be shouting " I 'm drowning , " especially in such a powerful voice , on a peaceful afternoon in the calm , sunny bay . He went over to the edge of the wall , joining Bert and Martha . " He seems to be doing all right , " Bert said . " He 's got a nice , strong stroke there . " " He 's going to have to do a little explaining later , " Martha said , " leaving his girl friend out there like that . " As they watched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a long time and Munnie began to feel his mouth get very dry , watching the spot where the man had disappeared . Then the man surfaced again , this time with his shoulders and arms bare , white and glistening against the deep blue water . He had taken off his shirt underwater and a moment later the shirt came up and floated away , billowing soddenly . The man shouted again . By now it was plain that he was calling directly to the three of them , standing on the wall . The man started swimming again , thrashing heavily . Munnie scanned the beach and the wharf on which the Snipes were put up on blocks for the winter . There was n't a boat of any kind he could use , or even a length of rope . He listened for the sound of the hammer they had heardp146when they had first come onto the wall . Then he realized it had stopped a long time ago , while they were still eating . Far across , on the other side of the bay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water and there were no swimmers or fishermen or children playing anywhere in sight . The entire world of stone , sand and seathat afternoon seemed to be given over to the three of , them standing on the wall , and the woman clinging to the bottom of the capsized boat calling shrilly and angrily to the half-naked man struggling in the water and moving slowly and painfully away from her . Why could n't this have happened in August ? Munnie thought irritably . He looked down at the water rippling in gentle regular swells against the base of the wall . It was n't very deep now , with the tide out , four or five feet at the most , and huge chunks of rock and concrete broke the surface irregularly . If you jumped it was a drop of at least fifteen feet and there would be no avoiding the rocks . Munnie looked , almost embarrassedly , across at Martha and Bert . Martha was squinting and there were lines on her forehead . She was biting her thumbnail absently like a little girl puzzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mildly interested , as though he were watching the performance of an acrobat in a third-rate circus . " The damn fool , " Bert said mildly . " If he could n't handle a boat any better than that you 'd think he 'd have had the sense to stick close to the shore . " " Frenchmen , " Martha said . " They think they can do anything . " She went back to chewing on her nail . The man called again , aiming it at them . " What 're we going to do ? " Munnie asked  | " Bawl the stupid bastard out , " Bert said , " when he comes ashore , for being such a lousy sailor . " Munnie peered at the swimmer . He was going more slowly now and he seemed to be settling deeper in the water after each stroke . " I do n't think he 's going to make it , " Munnie said . " Well , " said Bert , " that 'll be too bad . " Martha said nothing . Munnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be able to bear remembering today , standing here , watching a man drown . Then another picture flicked before his eyes . It was sharp and clear and there was nothing missing . It was of Bert and Martha and himself standing in front of a French policeman , seated at a desk , with his cap on , scratching away with a leaking fountain pen in a little black book . " So , " the policeman was saying , " you wish to report a drowning ? " " Yes . " " So  --  you saw this gentleman , some distance from the shore , waving at you , and then he disappeared ? " " Yes . " " And the lady ? " " The last we saw of her she was still holding onto the boat , floating out to sea . " " Ah . And  --  uh  --  what steps did you take , personally ? " " We .. . we came here and reported it . " " Oh , yes . Of course . " More scratching in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passports , please . " A quick riffling through the pages and one short , coldly smiling glance as the policeman tossed them on the desk . " Ah , Americans , all of you ... "  |p148The  man out in the water went under again for a second . Munnie tried to swallow again . This time he could n't manage it . " I 'm going to go get him , " he said . But for a moment he did n't move , as though , somehow , just saying it would fix everything , put the man on dry land , right the boat , stop the screams . " It 's two hundred and fifty yards at least from the beach , " Bert said , very calmly . " And then two hundred and fifty yards back , or a little less , with a crazy Frenchman holding onto your neck . " Munnie listened gratefully . " Yes , " he said . " At least . " " You never swam five hundred yards in your life , " Bert said , sounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice was hoarse and terrified . Munnie started walking swiftly along the wall , back to where there was a narrow flight of steps leading down to the little beach in front of the fort . He did n't run because he did n't want to be out of breath when he went into the water . " Munnie ! " he heard Bert call behind him . " Do n't be a damn fool ! " Even as he started down the steep flight of steps , slippery with moss , Munnie noticed that Martha had n't said anything . When he got down to the beach he trotted across it , at the water line , to get to the point nearest the man . He stopped , breathing heavily , and waved at the swimmer , encouraging him . Now , down at water level , it looked a good deal more than two hundred and fifty yards . He kicked off his shoes and tore off his shirt . The wind felt cold on his skin . He took off his pants , tossing them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorts . He hesitated . They were old shorts and they had torn at the crotch and he had mended them , clumsily , himself . He had a sudden picture of his body washed ashore and people noticing the shabby mending job and smiling a little . He unbuttoned the shorts , his fingers fumbling thickly at the buttons and let the shorts drop to the sand . As he walked deliberately into the water , he thought , She 's never seen me naked , I wonder what she thinks . He scraped his toes on a rock and the pain made the tears come into his eyes . He kept walking until the water was up to his chest , then pushed off and began to swim . The water was cold and his skin felt tight and frozen almost at once . He tried not to swim too fast , so that he would have some strength left when he reached the drowningman . Whenever he looked up to see how far he 'd gone it seemed to him that he had hardly moved at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . Somehow he always seemed to be veering to his left , in the direction of the wall , and he had to keep correcting himself all the time . Once , he looked up at the wall , searching for Bert and Martha . He could n't see them and he had a moment of panic . What the hell have they done ? he thought . They 've left . He turned over on his back , losing precious seconds , and saw them on the beach , standing at the water 's edge , watching him . Of course , he thought . He turned over and kept on swimming methodically toward the Frenchman . Whenever he picked his head out of the water , the Frenchman seemed to be screaming , and just as far away as ever . He decided not to look again for awhile . It was too discouraging . Then his arms began to feel tired . It ca n't be , he thought.  |p150I  have n't even gone fifty yards yet . Still , the muscles between his shoulders and his elbows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a deep ache of weariness in the back of his arms . His right hand began to cramp a little , too , and he let it flutter loosely through the water , which slowed him down , but he did n't know what else to do about it . The cramp reminded him that he had eaten not very long before and had a lot of wine and grapes and cheese . As he swam , with the water a green blur in his eyes and the slow , steady push of it going past his ears , he remembered his mother , in all the summers of his boyhood , on the shores of the lake in New Hampshire , saying , " No swimming for at least two hours after meals . " Sitting on a little wooden chair , under a striped umbrella , watching the children play on the narrow , pebbly beach . The back of his neck and the base of his skull started to ache now , and his thoughts wavered across his consciousness , disconnected and slippery . He had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to cool off and play around . Swimming had always seemed like a boring sport . The same old thing , over and over again , lift one arm , lift the other arm , kick , lift one arm , lift the other arm , kick , never really get anyplace . And he had never learned to keep the water out of his ears and sometimes he 'd feel deaf for hours and the water would n't come out until he 'd gone to bed and slept on one side for a long time . His arms began to feel numb and he rolled more and more , in an effort to get his shoulders into the job , and he seemed to be swimming lower in the water than he ever had before . There 's no sense in wasting time , he thought , making himself worry about something else besides his arms , I might as well figure out what to do once I get there.  |p151Laboriously  , he tried to phrase what he would say to the man in French when he approached him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would stay off from the man and try to calm him down before grabbing him . Dimly , he remembered having seen a demonstration of life-saving at a pool when he was fourteen years old . He had n't paid much attention , because the boy behind him had surreptitiously kept flicking at him with a wet towel . But there was something about letting yourself sink if the drowning man put his arms around your neck , then twistingand putting your hand under his chin and pushing back . He had n't believed it when he was fourteen years old and he did n't believe it now . It was one of those things that looked good in practice , on dry land . Then there were all the stories about hitting people on the chin and knockingthem out . More dry land . He had never knocked anybodyout in his whole life . His mother hated fighting . Monsieur , soyez tranquille . Roulez sur votre dos , s'il vous plait . Then he 'd go in and grab him by the hair and start towing him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awful lot of trouble getting Frenchmen to understand his accent , especially here in the Basque country . Martha had no trouble at all . They all said what a charming accent she had . Well , why not , after all that time at the Sorbonne ? She should have come with him as an interpreter , if for nothing else . Tournez sur votre dos . That was better . He swam heavily and slowly , his eyes beginning to smart from the salt water . When he lifted his head there were white and silver spots before his eyes and everything seemed to be blurred and he could n't really see anything much . He kept on swimming . After fifty strokes he decided he 'd stop and tread water and look around . The idea ofp152treading water now seemed like the greatest pleasure ever vouchsafed the human race . He started to count the strokes . Fourteen , fifteen , sixteen . . . Lord , he thought , what if he 's bald ? He tried to remember what the man 's head had looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat . There had been a funny pale gleam . Bald , Munnie decided desperately . Nothing is going to go right . He started counting strokes all over again . By the time he got to thirty-five he knew he would have to stop for awhile . He made himself do five more , then stopped and rolled over on his back , gasping and blowing water and looking up at the sky . He got his breath back and turned again and trod water , searching for the Frenchman . He blinked his eyes and rubbed them with the back of his hand , sinking up to his mouth as he did so . The Frenchmanwas n't there . Oh , God , he thought , he went down . Then he heard the chugging and twisted in the water . A fishing boat was bearing away from the spot where Munniehad last seen the Frenchman , and was going toward the overturned dory . Munnie trod water , watching while the tuna boat stopped , and two fishermen reached down and pulled the woman on board . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from the south , concealed by the little headland on which the fort was built , and must have coasted along the seaward side of the wall and entered the channel while he was swimming blindly out from the beach . The men on the tuna boat threw a line onto the dory , then swung around and headed for Munnie . He waited for it , fighting his lungs . The tuna boat , painted blue , and slow and old , approached him , looking big and safe as itp153drew nearer . Munnie saw grinning , tanned wide faces , capped by blue berets in the bow , and he waved , with great effort , as the tuna boat slowed down and came to a stop next to him . " Ca va ? " a fisherman shouted , grinning down at him . A cigarette , burned almost to the end , hung plastered to his lips . Munnie managed to smile . " Ca va bien , " he called . " Tres bien . " The man who had been rescued came to the rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at Munnie . Munnie saw that he had plenty of hair . The Frenchman did n't say anything . He was a fat young man with a hurt and dignified expression on his face . At his side appeared a woman . She had been heavily made up and the seawater had done a great deal of damage to the rouge and mascara . She stared furiously down at Munnie , then turned to the Frenchman . She grabbed him by both ears and shook him . " Crapaud ! " she said loudly . " Espece de cochon . " The Frenchman closed his eyes and allowed his head to be shaken , keeping his face sad and dignified . The fishermangrinned more broadly . " Alors , " one of the fishermen said , throwing a line out toward Munnie , " allons-y . " Munnie looked longingly at the line . Then he remembered that he was naked . He shook his head . One thing that was not going to happen to him that afternoon was to be fished out of the sea naked in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pig and a toad . " I 'm O.K. , " Munnie said , up to the brown , tough , amused faces , used to all sorts of comical , salty accidents andp156escapes . " Je suis O.K. I want to swim . I mean  --  Je voudrais bien nager . " " O.K. , O.K. , " the fishermen said , laughing , as though what he had said was enormously witty . They pulled in the line and waved and the tuna boat swung around and started in toward the harbor , towing the dory . As it went , over the sound of the engine , Munnie could still hear the sound of the woman screaming . Well , Munnie thought , watching the boat sail off , at least they understood me . Then he turned and looked at the beach . It looked miles away and Munnie was surprised that he had swum that far . He had never swum that far before in his life . On the beach , at the water line , with the tower of the fort behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures , throwing long shadows now in the declining sun . Taking a deep breath , Munnie started to swim in . He had to turn over and float every ten yards or so and for awhile it seemed to him that he was n't moving at all , only going through the motions of swimming , but finally , putting his feet down , he touched bottom . It was still fairly deep , up to his chin , and he pulled his feet up and stubbornlykept on swimming . And as a gesture , which he did n't try to understand , even as he did it , he swam all the way in , making himself spurt and do a proper crawl , until the water was so shallow that his finger-tips scraped the sand . Then he stood up . He wavered a little , but he stood up and , making himself smile , walked slowly , naked , with the water streaming off him , toward where Bert and Martha stood next to the little pile of his clothes on the beach.  | " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " what part of Switzerland are you from , Bud ? " As he bent over and picked up the towel and began to dry himself , shivering under the rough cloth , Munnie heard Martha laugh . He rubbed himself dry . He took a long time , shivering badly , too weary and not interested enough to try to cover his nakedness . They drove back to the hotel in silence and when Munnie said that he thought he 'd lie down and try to rest for awhile , they both agreed that it was probably the best thing to do . He slept uneasily , his ears half deaf and stopped with water and the blood pounding in them like a distant , fitful sea . When Bert came in and said it was time for dinner , Munnie told him he was n't hungry and that he wanted to rest . " We 're going to the Casino after dinner , " Bert said , " Should we stop by and pick you up ? " " No , " Munnie said . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence in the darkened room . Then Bert said , " Good night . Sleep well , Fat Man , " and went out . Alone , Munnie lay staring at the shadowed ceiling , thinking . I 'm not fat . Why does he call me that ? He only started it in the middle of the summer . Then he slept again and only awakened when he heard the car drive up outside the hotel and the steps going softly up the stairs , past his door , to the floor above . He heard a door open and close gently upstairs and he made himself shut his eyes and try to sleep . When he awoke the pillow was wet , where the water had run out of his ears , and he felt better . When he sat up the blood stopped pounding inside his head , too . Hep158turned on the lamp and looked at Bert 's bed . It was empty . He looked at his watch . It was four-thirty . He got out of bed and lit a cigarette and went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and the sea was milky and was making an even , grumbling sound , like an old man complaining about the life that lay behind him . For a moment , he wondered where he would have been at this hour if the tuna boat had n't come in around the breakwater . Then he doused his cigarette and began to pack . It did n't take long , because they had been travelling light all summer . When he finished he made sure that the extra key for the car was on his ring . Then he wrote a short note for Bert , telling him that he 'd decided to take off for Paris . He hoped to get to Paris in time to catch the boat . He hoped this would n't inconvenience Bert too much and he knew that Bert would understand . He did n't mention Martha . He carried his bag out to the car through the dark hotel and threw the bag into the empty space next to the driver 's seat . He put on a raincoat and a pair of gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without lookingback to see whether the sound of the engine had awakened anyone or whether anyone had come to a window to watch him leave . There was mist in the low places on the road , and he drove slowly , feeling it wet against his face . With the sighing regular noise of the windshield wipers and the steady , damp light of the headlights on the road ahead of him almost hypnotizing him , he drove mechanically , not thinking of anything at all.  |p159It  was only far past Bayonne , when the dawn had broken and he had cut off the lights and the road stretched gray and glistening through the dark pine aisles of Les Landes , that he allowed himself to remember the day and night that had just passed . And then all he could think was , It 's my fault . I let the summer go on one day too long.  |p160HUGH  FORESTER ALWAYS REMEMBERED EVERYTHING . HE REmemberedthe dates of the Battle of New Cold Harbor ( May 31-June 12 , 1864 ) ; he remembered the name of his teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oneforty-five ; no eyelashes ) ; he remembered the record numberof strikeouts in one game in the National League ( Dizzy Dean , St. Louis Cards , July 30 , 1933 , seventeen men , against the Cubs ) ; he remembered the fifth line of " To a Skylark " ( Shelley : " In profuse strains of unpremeditated art " ) ; he remembered the address of the first girl he ever kissed ( Prudence Collingwood , 248 East South Temple Street , Salt Lake City , Utah ; March 14 , 1918 ) ; he remembered the dates of the three partitions of Poland and thedestruction of the Temple ( 1772 , 1793 , 1795 , and 70 A.D. ) ; he remembered the number of ships taken by Nelson atp161the Battle of Trafalgar ( twenty ) , and the profession of the hero of Frank Norris 's novel McTeague ( dentist ) ; he remembered the name of the man who won the Pulitzer Prize for history in 1925 ( Frederic L. Paxson ) , the name of the Derby winner at Epsom in 1923 ( Papyrus ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1940 ( 4726 ) ; he remembered the figures for his blood pressure ( a hundred and sixty-five over ninety ; too high ) , his blood type ( 0 ) , and his vision ( forty over twenty for the right eye and thirty over twenty for the left ) ; he remembered what his boss told him when he was fired from his first job ( " I 'm getting a machineto do the job " ) , and what his wife said when he proposed to her ( " I want to live in New York " ) ; he remembered the correct name of Lenin ( Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov ) , and what caused the death of Louis XIV ( gangreneof the leg ) . He also remembered the species of birds , the mean depths of the navigable rivers of America ; the names , given and assumed , of all the Popes , including the ones at Avignon ; the batting averages of Harry Heilmann and Heinie Groh ; the dates of the total eclipses of the sun since the reign of Charlemagne ; the speed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence ; all of the Rubdiydt of Omar Khayyam ; the population of the lost settlement of Roanoke ; the rate of fire of the Browning automatic rifle ; the campaigns of Caesar in Gaul and Britain ; the name of the shepherdess in As You Like It and the amount of money he had in the Chemical Bank &; Trust on the morning of December 7 , 1941 ( $2,367.58 ) . Then he forgot his twenty-fourth wedding anniversary ( January 25th ) . His wife , Narcisse , looked at him strangely over breakfast that morning , but he was reading the previousnight 's newspaper and thinking , They will never getp162it straight in Washington , and he did n't pay much attention . There was a letter from their son , who was at the University of Alabama , but he put it in his pocket without opening it . It was addressed only to him , so he knew it was a request for money . When Morton wrote his dutiful , familial notes they were addressed to both his parents . Morton was at Alabama because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Yale , Dartmouth , Williams , Antioch , the College of the City of New York , or the Universityof Colorado . Narcisse asked if Hugh wanted fish for dinner and he said yes , and Narcisse said that fish was criminally expensive , too , and he said yes , and she asked if anything was the matter and he said no and kissed her and walked out of the apartment to the 242nd Street subway station and stood all the way down to the office , reading the morning newspaper . Narcisse 's parents had lived in France for some time and that was where the name came from ; by now he was used to it . As he read his newspaper in the crowded car he wished , mildly , that most of the people whom people wrote about in the newspapers would vanish . Hugh was the first one in the office , and he went to his cubbyhole and sat at his desk , leaving the door open , enjoying the empty desks and the sound of silence . He remembered that Narcisse 's nose had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to cry . He wondered briefly why , but knew that he would be told in good time , and dismissed it . Narcisse cried between five and eight times a month . The company for which he worked was putting out a one-volume encyclopedia , absolutely complete , on Indian paper , with seven hundred and fifty illustrations . Therep163was some talk of its being called the Giant Pocket Encyclopedia , but no final decision had as yet been reached . Hugh was working on the " S " s . Today he had Soap , Sodium , Sophocles , and Sorrento before him . He remembered that Maxim Gorki had lived in Sorrento , and that of the hundred and twenty-three plays that Sophocles wrote , only seven had been discovered . Hugh was not actually unhappy at his work except when Mr. Gorsline appeared . Mr. Gorslinewas the owner and editor-in-chief of the house , and believed in standing behind the backs of his employees , silently watching them at their labors . Whenever Mr. Gorsline came into the room , Hugh had the curious feeling that blood was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wore tweed suits , had the face and figure of a picador , and had started with calendars . The house still put out a great variety of calendars  --  pornographic , religious and occasional . Hugh was very useful on calendars because he remembered things like the death of Oliver Cromwell ( September 3 , 1658 ) and the date on which Marconi sent the first wireless message across the Atlantic ( December 12 , 1901 ) and the date of the first steamboat run from New York to Albany ( August 17 , 1807 ) . Mr. Gorsline appreciated Hugh 's peculiar talents and was relentlessly paternal about his welfare . Mr. Gorsline was a believer in homeopathic medicines and the healthgivingproperties of raw vegetables , particularly eggplant . He was also opposed to glasses , having thrown his away in 1944 after reading a book about a series of exercises for the muscles of the eyes . He had persuaded Hugh to discard his glasses for a period of seven months in 1948 , during which time Hugh had suffered from continual headaches ,  |p164for  which Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeopathic pharmacy which made Hugh feel as though he had been hit in the skull with bird shot . Now whenever Mr. Gorsline stood behind Hugh , he stared at Hugh 's glasses with the stubborn , Irredentist expressionof an Italian general surveying Trieste . Hugh 's health , while not actively bad , was shabby . He had frequent , moist colds , and his eyes had a tendency to become bloodshot after lunch . There was no hiding these lapses or the fact that in cold weather he had to make several trips an hour to the men 's room . At such times , Mr. Gorsline would break his customary silence to outline diets designed to improve the tone of the nasal passages , the eyes and the kidneys . During the morning , Mr. Gorsline came into Hugh 's room twice . The first time , he stood behind Hugh 's chair without saying a word for five minutes , then said , " Still on sodium ? " and left . The next time , he stood silently for eight minutes , then said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and left . Each time , Hugh had the familiar feeling in the groin . Just before lunch , Hugh 's daughter came into his office . She kissed him and said , " Many happy returns of the day , Daddy , " and gave him a small oblong package with a bow of colored ribbon on top of it . Clare was twenty-two and had been married four years but she refused to stop saying " Daddy . " Hugh opened the package , feeling confused . There was a gold-topped fountain pen in it . It was the fourth fountain pen Clare had given him in the last six years , two on birthdays and the third on Christmas . She had not inherited her father 's memory.  | " What 's this for ? " Hugh asked . " Daddy ! " Clare said . " You 're kidding . " Hugh stared at the pen . He knew it was n't his birthday ( June 12th ) . And it certainly was n't Christmas ( December 25th ) . " It ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for-get ! " Hugh remembered Narcisse 's face at breakfast , and the twitching of her nose . " Oh , my , " he said . " You better load yourself with flowers before you set foot in the house tonight , " Clare said . She peered anxiously at her father . " Daddy , are you all right ? " she asked . " Of course I 'm all right , " Hugh said , annoyed . " Everybodyforgets an anniversary once in a while . " " Not you , Daddy . " " Me , too . I 'm human , too , " he said , but he felt shaken . He unscrewed the top of the pen and wrote TWENTYFOURYEARS , in capitals , on a pad , keeping his head down . He now owned eight fountain pens . " It 's just what I needed , Clare , " he said , and put it in his pocket . " Thank you very much . " " You have n't forgotten that you promised to take me to lunch , have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appointment for lunch , because , she told Hugh , she had some serious problems to discuss . " Of course not , " Hugh said briskly . He put on his overcoat , and they went out together . Hugh ordered sole , then changed to a lamb chop , because he remembered that Narcisse had said at breakfast they were to have fish for dinner . Clare ordered roast chicken and Waldorf salad , and a bottle of wine , because , she said , the afternoons becameless sad after a bottle of wine . Hugh did n't under/stand why a pretty twenty-two-year-old girl needed wine to keep her from being sad in the afternoons , but he did n't interfere . While Clare was going over the wine card , Hugh took Morton 's letter out of his pocket and read it . Morton was asking for two hundred and fifty dollars . It seemed that he had borrowed a fraternity brother 's Plymouth and gone into a ditch with it after a dance and the repairs had come to a hundred and twenty-five dollars . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nose had been broken and the doctor had charged a hundred dollars for the nose and Morton had promised to pay . Then , there was ten dollars for two books in a course on ethics and fifteen dollars just , as Mortonphrased it , to make it a round number . Hugh put the letter back in his pocket without saying anything about it to Clare . At least , Hugh thought , it was n't as bad as last year , when it looked as though Morton was going to be kicked out of school for cheating on a calculus examination . As Clare ate her chicken and drank her wine , she told her father what was troubling her . Mostly , it was Freddie , her husband . She was undecided , she said as she ate away steadily at her chicken , whether to leave him or have a baby . She was sure Freddie was seeing another woman , on East Seventy-eighth Street , in the afternoons , and before she took a step in either direction she wanted Hugh to confrontFreddie man to man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talk to her . Whenever she brought the subject up , he left the house and went to a hotel for the night . If it was to be a divorce , she would need at least a thousand dollars from Hugh for the six weeks in Reno , because Freddie had already told her hep167would n't advance a cent for any damn thing like that . Besides , Freddie was having a little financial trouble at the moment . He had overdrawn against his account at the automobile agency for which he worked , and they had clamped down on him two weeks ago . If they had the baby , the doctor Clare wanted would cost eight hundred dollars , and there would be at least another five hundred for the hospital and nurses , and she knew she could depend on Daddy for that . She drank her wine and talked on as Hugh ate silently . Freddie , she said , was also five months behind in his dues and greens fees at the golf club , and they were going to post his name if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really urgent , because of the disgrace , and Freddie had behaved like an absolute savage around the house ever since he received the letter from the club secretary . " I told him , " Clare said , with tears in her eyes and eating steadily , " I told him I would gladly go out and work , but he said he 'd be damned if he 'd let people say he could n't support his own wife , and , of course , you have to respect a feeling like that . And he told me he would n't come to you for another cent , either , and you ca n't help admiring him for that , can you ? " " No , " Hugh said , remembering that his son-in-law had borrowed from him , over a period of four years , three thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars and had not paid back a cent . " No , you ca n't . Did he know you were going to come and talk to me today ? " " Vaguely , " Clare said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she carefully harvested the last bits of apple and walnut from her salad , Clare said she did n't really like to burden him with her problems but he was the only onep168in the whole world whose judgment she really trusted . He was so solid and sensible and smart , she said , and she did n't know any more whether she really loved Freddie or not and she was so confused and she hated to see Freddie so unhappy all the time about money and she wanted to know whether Hugh honestly felt she was ready for motherhoodat the age of twenty-two . By the time they finished their coffee , Hugh had promised to talk to Freddie very soon about the woman on Seventy-eighth Street and to underwrite either the trip to Reno or the obstetrician , as the case might be , and he had made a half promise about the back dues and the greens fees . On the way to the office , Hugh bought an alligator handbagfor Narcisse for sixty dollars and worried sharply , for a moment , about inflation as he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a little difficult to work after lunch , because he kept thinking about Clare and what she had been like as a little girl ( measles at four , mumps the year after , braces from eleven to fifteen , acne between fourteen and seventeen ) . He worked very slowly on Sorrento . Mr. Gorsline came in twice during the afternoon . The first time he said , " Still on Sorrento ? " and the second time he said , " Who the hell cares if that Communist Russian wrote a book there ? " In addition to the usual sensation in the groin , Hugh noticed a quickening of his breath , which was almost a gasp , when Mr. Gorsline stood behind him during the afternoon . After work , he went into the little bar on Lexington Avenue where he met Jean three times a week . She was sitting there , finishing her first whisky , and he sat downp169beside her and squeezed her hand in greeting . They had been in love for eleven years now , but he had kissed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a classmate of Narcisse 's at Bryn Mawr and they had decided early in the game to be honorable . She was a tall , majestic woman who , because she had led a troubled life , still looked comparativelyyoung . They sat sadly and secretly in sad little bars late in the afternoon and talked in low , nostalgic tones about how different everything could have been . In the beginning , their conversation had been more animated , and for a half hour at a time Hugh had recovered some of the optimism and confidence that he had had as a young man who had taken all the honors at college , before it had become apparent that a retentive memory and talent and intelligence and luck were not all the same thing . " I think , very soon , " Jean said while he was sipping his drink , " we 'll have to give this up . It is n't going anywhere , really , is it , and I just do n't feel right about it . I feel guilty . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh that he had done anything to feel guilty about , with the possible exception of the kiss on V-E Day . But now that Jean had said it , he realized that he probably would feel guilty from now on , every time he entered the bar and saw her sitting there . " Yes , " he said sadly . " I suppose you 're right . " " I 'm going away for the summer , " Jean said . " In June . When I come back I 'm not going to see you any more . " Hugh nodded miserably . The summer was still five months away , but behind him he had a sense of something slipping , with a rustling noise , like a curtain coming . down . He had to stand in the subway all the way home , and the car was so crowded that he could n't turn the pages ofp170his newspaper . He read and reread the front page , thinking , I certainly am glad I was n't elected President . It was hot in the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travellers , and he had a new , uneasy feeling that his flesh was overburdening him . Then , just before he came to Two hundred and forty-second Street , he realized that he had left the alligator bag on his desk in the office . He felt a little tickle of terror in his throat and knees . It was not so much that , empty-handed , he faced an evening of domestic sighs , half-spoken reproaches , and almost certain tears . It was not even so much the fact that he mistrusted the cleaning woman who did his office every night and who had once ( November 3 , 1950 ) , he was sure , taken a dollar and thirty cents ' worth of airmail stamps from the upper right-hand drawer . But , standing there in the now uncrowded car , he had to face the fact that twice in one day he had forgotten something . He could n't remember when anything like that had ever happened to him before . He touched his head with his fingertips , as though there might be some obscure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up drinking . He drank only five or six whiskies a week , but the induction of partial amnesia by alcohol was a well-established medicalprinciple , and perhaps his level of tolerance was abnormallylow . The evening passed as he had expected . He bought some roses at the station for Narcisse , but he could n't tell her about the alligator bag left on his desk , because he figured , correctly , that that would only compound the morning 's offense . He even suggested that they return to the city for an anniversary dinner , but Narcisse had had the whole day alone to augment her self-pity and brood upon herp171martyrdom , and she insisted on eating the fish , which had cost ninety-three cents a pound . By ten-thirty she was crying . Hugh slept badly and got to the office early the next morning , but even the sight of the alligator bag , left squarely in the middle of the desk by the cleaning woman , did not raise his spirits . During the day he forgot the names of three of Sophocles ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and the telephone number of his dentist . It started that way . Hugh began to make more and more frequent trips to the reference library on the thirteenth floor , dreading the trip through the office , because of the way his fellow-workers commenced to look at him , curious and puzzled , as he traversed the room again and again in the course of an hour . One day he forgot the titles of the works of Sardou , the area of Santo Domingo , the symptoms of silicosis , the definition of syndrome , and the occasion of the mortification of Saint Simeon Stylites . Hoping it would pass , he said nothing about it to anyone  --  not even to Jean , in the little bar on Lexington Avenue . Mr. Gorsline took to standing for longer and longer periods behind Hugh 's desk , and Hugh sat there , pretending to be working , pretending he did n't look haggard , his jowls hanging from his cheekbones like gallows ropes , his brain feeling like a piece of frozen meat that was being nibbled by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and once , at four-thirty , he told Hugh to take the afternoon off . Hugh had worked for Mr. Gorsline for eighteen years and this was the first time Mr. Gorsline had told him to take an afternoon off . When Mr. Gors/line left his office , Hugh sat at his desk , staring blindly into terrifying depths . One morning , some days after the anniversary , Hugh forgot the name of his morning newspaper . He stood in front of the news dealer , staring down at the ranked Times and Tribunes and News and Mirrors , and they all looked the same to him . He knew that for the past twenty-five years he had been buying the same paper each morning , but now there was no clue for him in their makeup or in their headlines as to which one it was . He bent down and peered more closely at the papers . The President , a headlineannounced , was to speak that night . As Hugh straightenedup , he realized he no longer remembered the President'sname or whether he was a Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what could be described only as an exquisite pang of pleasure . But he knew it was deceptive , like the ecstasy described by T. E. Lawrence on the occasion when he was nearly beaten to death by the Turks . He bought a copy of Holiday , and stared numbly at the colored photographs of distant cities all the way down to the office . That morning , he forgot the date on which John L. Sullivan won the heavyweight championship of the world , and the name of the inventor of the submarine . He also had to go to the reference library because he was n't sure whether Santander was in Chile or Spain . He was sitting at his desk that afternoon , staring at his hands , because for an hour he had had the feeling that mice were running between his fingers , when his son-inlawcame into the office . " Hi , Hughie , old boy , " his son-in-law said . From thep173very first night his son-in-law had appeared at the house , he had been unfalteringly breezy with Hugh . Hugh stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stared at his son-in-law . He knew it was his son-in-law . He knew it was Clare 's husband . But he could n't remember the man 's name . For the second time that day he experiencedthe trilling wave of pleasure that he had felt at the newsstand when he realized he had forgotten the name and political affiliations of the President of the United States . Only this time it seemed to last . It lasted while he shook hands with his son-in-law and all during the trip down in the elevator with him , and it lasted in the bar next door while he bought his son-in-law three Martinis . " Hughie , old boy , " his son-in-law said during the third Martini , " let 's get down to cases . Clare said you had a problemyou wanted to talk to me about . Spit it out , old boy , and let 's get it over with . What have you got on your mind ? " Hugh looked hard at the man across the table . He searched his brain conscientiously , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly involve them . " No , " Hugh said slowly . " I have nothing in particular on my mind . " His son-in-law kept looking at Hugh belligerently while Hugh was paying for the drinks , but Hugh merely hummed under his breath , smiling slightly at the waitress . Outside , where they stood for a moment , his son-in-law cleared his throat once and said , " Now , look here , old boy , if it 's about  --  " but Hugh shook his hand warmly and walked briskly away , feeling deft and limber . But back in his office , looking down at his cluttered desk , his sense of well-being left him . He had moved on top174the " T " s by now , and as he looked at the scraps of paper and the jumble of books on his desk , he realized that he had forgotten a considerable number of facts about Tacitusand was completely lost on the subject of Taine . There was a sheet of notepaper on his desk with the date and the beginning of a salutation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper and tried to remember who it was he had been writing to . It was five minutes before it came to him ; the letter was to have been to his son , and he had meant , finally , to enclose the check for the two hundred and fifty dollars , as requested . He felt in his inside pocket for his checkbook . It was n't there . He looked carefullythrough all the drawers of his desk , but the checkbookwas n't there , either . Shaking a little , because this was the first time in his life that he had misplaced a checkbook , he decided to call up his bank and ask them to mail him a new book . He picked up the phone . Then he stared at it blankly . He had forgotten the telephone number of the bank . He put the phone down and opened the classified telephone directory to " B. " Then he stopped . He swalloweddryly . He had forgotten the name of his bank . He looked at the page of banks . All the names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have any special meaning for him . He closed the book and stood up and went over to the window . He looked out . There were two pigeons sitting on the sill , looking cold , and across the street a bald man was standing at a window in the building opposite , smoking a cigarette and staring down as though he were contemplating suicide . Hugh went back to his desk and sat down . Perhaps it was an omen , he thought , the thing about the checkbook . Perhaps it was a sign that he ought to take a sterner line with his son . Let him pay for his own mistakes for once.  |p175He  picked up his pen , resolved to write this to Alabama . " Dear . . . " he read . He looked for a long time at the word . Then he carefully closed his pen and put it back in his pocket . He no longer remembered his son 's name . He put on his coat and went out , although it was only three-twenty-five . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly , feeling better and better with each block . By the time he reached the Museum , he felt like a man who has just been told that he has won a hundreddollarbet on a fourteen-to-one shot . In the Museum , he went and looked at the Egyptians . He had meant to look at the Egyptians for years , but he had always been too busy . When he got through with the Egyptians , he felt wonderful . He continued feeling wonderful all the way home in the subway . He no longer made any attempt to buy the newspapers . They did n't make any sense to him . He did n't recognize any of the people whose names appeared in the columns . It was like reading the Karachi Sind Observer or the Sonora El Mundo . Not having a paper in his hands made the long ride much more agreeable . He spent his time in the subway looking at the people around him . The people in the subway seemed much more interesting , much more pleasant , now that he no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Of course , once he opened his front door , his euphoria left him . Narcisse had taken to looking at him very closely in the evenings , and he had to be very careful with his conversation . He did n't want Narcisse to discover what was happening to him . He did n't want her to worry , or try to cure him . He sat all evening listening to the phonograph , but he forgot to change the record . It was an automaticmachine and it played the last record of the second Saint-Saens piano concerto seven times before Narcissep176came in from the kitchen and said , " I 'm going out of my mind , " and turned it off . He went to bed early . He heard Narcisse crying in the next bed . It was the third time that month . There were between two and five more times to go . He remembered that . The next afternoon , he was working on Talleyrand . He was bent over his desk , working slowly but not too badly , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung in his chair . A gray-haired man in a tweed suit was standing there , staring down at him . " Yes ? " Hugh said curtly . " Are you looking for some-one ? " The man , surprisingly , turned red , then went out of the room , slamming the door behind him . Hugh shrugged incuriouslyand turned back to Talleyrand . The elevator was crowded when he left for the day , and the hall downstairs was thronged with clerks and secretarieshurrying out of the building . Near the entrance , a very pretty girl was standing , and she smiled and waved at Hugh over the heads of the homeward-bound office workers . Hugh stopped for an instant , flattered , and was tempted to smile back . But he had a date with Jean , and anyway he was too old for anything like that . He set his face and hurried out in the stream of people . He thought he heard a kind of wail , which sounded curiously like " Daddy , " but he knew that was impossible , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoying the shining winter evening , and started north . He passed two bars and was approaching a third when he slowed down . He retracedhis steps , peering at the bar fronts . They all hadp177chromium on them , and neon lights , and they all looked the same . There was another bar across the street . He went and looked at the bar across the street , but it was just like the others . He went into it , anyway , but Jean was n't there . He ordered a whisky , standing at the bar , and asked the bartender , " Have you seen a lady alone in here in the last half hour ? " The bartender looked up at the ceiling , thinking . " What 's she look like ? " he asked . " She  --  " Hugh stopped . He sipped his drink . " Never mind , " he said to the bartender . He laid a dollar bill on the counter and went out . Walking over to the subway station he felt better than he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eleven at the annual field day of the Brigham Young Public School in Salt Lake City on June g , 1915 . The feeling lasted , of course , only until Narcisse put the soup on the table . Her eyes were puffed , and she had obviously been crying that afternoon , which was curious , because Narcisse never cried when she was alone . Eating his dinner , conscious of Narcisse watching him closely across the table , Hugh began to feel the mice between his fingers again . After dinner , Narcisse said , " You ca n't fool me . There 's another woman . " She also said , " I never thought this would happen to me . " By the time Hugh went to bed , he felt like a passenger on a badly loaded freighter in a winter storm off Cape Hatteras . He awoke early , conscious that it was a sunny day outside . He lay in bed , feeling warm and healthy . There was a noise from the next bed , and he looked across the littlep178space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was middle-agedand was wearing curlers and she was snoring and Hugh was certain he had never seen her before in his life . He got out of bed silently , dressed quickly , and went out into the sunny day . Without thinking about it , he walked to the subway station . He watched the people hurrying toward the trains and he knew that he probably should join them . He had the feeling that somewhere in the city to the south , in some tall building on a narrow street , his arrival was expected . But he knew that no matter how hard he tried he would never be able to find the building . Buildings these days , it occurred to him suddenly , were too much like other buildings . He walked briskly away from the subway station in the direction of the river . The river was shining in the sun and there was ice along the banks . A boy of about twelve , in a plaid mackinaw and a wool hat , was sitting on a bench and regarding the river . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the frozen ground at his feet . Hugh sat down next to the boy . " Good morning , " he said pleasantly . " Good morning , " said the boy . " What 're you doing ? " Hugh asked . " I 'm counting the boats , " the boy said . " Yesterday I counted thirty-two boats . Not counting ferries . I do n't count ferries . " Hugh nodded . He put his hands in his pockets and looked down over the river . By five o'clock that afternoon he and the boy had counted forty-three boats , not includingferries . He could n't remember having had a nicer day.  |p179IT  IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ATTEND A WEDDING WITHOUT A SENSE OFforeboding or regret . Depending upon which side you are ranged , you are bound to have some unpleasant reservationsabout the bride or the groom , or perhaps both , and if you are cynical you are likely to remember other weddings you have witnessed and how the marriages eventually turned out . And if you are a man and the bride is beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you will feel a sharp , ignoble twinge of deprivation . But at Ronny Biddell 's wedding , although the bride was young and lovely and regarded Ronny with the most obviousbridal pleasure , I felt nothing but satisfaction and a strange kind of relief , a relief , I imagine , which must have been very close to the emotion felt by the brother of a matadorwho has watched a particularly dangerous fight , in which the matador has been upon the horns and has done foolhardy things all afternoon and has finally , exhausted and covered with blood , made a triumphant kill.  |p180Ronny  was not my brother and he was , of course , not covered with blood . He stood at the altar , ruddy , growing bald , sweating slightly , as he always did , a sturdy , round man in his tailcoat and striped trousers , looking , as he stood there , not quite being able to refrain from smiling a little , as though he had never been in danger in his life . I was at the wedding by accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up Ronny , and had , in fact , made a desultory inquiry or two , but everyone in England seemed to have changed addresses several times since the war , and I had not taken the time to track him down . The truth was , too , that I was a little afraid of what I might find if I finally did locate him , and I invented excuses not to press the search too assiduously . Then , one day , in a restaurant on Jermyn Street , I saw him across the room , sitting with a young , dark-haired girl of superlative beauty , who kept looking at Ronny with that narrowness and intensity of focus which is , in our era , in a crowded restaurant , the public advertisement of love . Fifteen minutes later I was being invited to the wedding . Now I was sitting in the church , among the polished , strange British faces , listening to the ceremony , staring at Ronny 's reddish scalp and his solid , polite shoulders , enjoying the curious feeling of relief for Ronny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known during the war who had later suffered or vanished or failed to live up to the hopes we had entertained for them , had arrived at this shining and victorious moment . I had met Ronny in London in 1943 . He was at that time a lieutenant in the British Army , hazily attached to the same project to which I was assigned , one of those interalliedmissions which had very little to do with winningp181the war , but which served , while the armies waited for the invasion of Europe , as an occasion of Anglo-American good-will and co-operation at almost no military cost . Ronny at first sight looked like the sort of man who had been deprived , only because of his youth , of a colonelcy in the Indian Army . He wore a mustache , he boomed , he carriedhimself like a soldier and drank like one  --  he was in fact so markedly the type of regular colonial officer , at least to American eyes , that we called him , much to his enjoyment , the Beefeater . The flaw in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hideously shy , especially with women . He had been brought up by aunts with so much circumspection that his respect for women at the age of twenty-eight was carried to an extreme which was , to all practical purposes , impotence . He was childishly candid about himself with his friends and I knew all his history within two weeks of meeting him . He was abnormally susceptible to women  --  the sight of a pretty face across a theater lobby could make him blush , almost as though all the confused thoughts and emotionsthat flooded through him at the sight of the girl were somehow guiltily plain to her , at a distance of twenty feet , and to everyone else present . And once , when a girl whom I had invited to have dinner with Ronny and me kissed him good night on the cheek , he confessed that it kept him up , half smiling and half in despair , for the entire night . He also had an uncomfortable tendency to breathe brokenly , like a sufferer from asthma , when talking to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In all that time in London , which , not to put too fine a point upon it , was a period of almost unprecedented camaraderie between the sexes , I never saw Ronny out with a girl of his own.  |p182That  is not to say that Ronny had never been involved with a woman . For two years before the war , he had lived in Paris , on a small income , wearing a beret , according to his report , and studying what he vaguely called Art . During that time he had met Virginie , or rather , as he later admitted , had permitted himself to be picked up by her in a cafe on a rainy evening and allowed to pay for her drink . " Frenchwomen , my dear fellow , " he confided in me , on the basis of his knowledge of Virginie , " are more in my line . Forthright . Not always playing that damned game with a man . Direct . " It developed that Virginie had not been as direct as all that . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray eyes and that French thing about the mouth . But she lived , so she said , with her family , who were so savagely devout that Ronny was not even permitted to meet them . After the numberless dinners , evenings at the opera and theater to which Ronny escorted her , she would leave him , severely , at the door . He himself lived with a family and he had to go through the salon to reach his room , and there never was any hope of inviting her there , He fell very much in love with her and had reached a point at which he was taking her out three nights a week and kissing her at her doorway and mentioning marriage when the war broke out . There was a tearful and public parting in the LuxembourgGardens and Ronny went back to England , promisinga letter a day and a quick victory for the linked arms of their two countries . Healthy , willing and with no discerniblemilitary talent , he was enlisted as a private and put at a desk in a motor-repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come top183grips with the enemy , he pulled what wires he could to get himself transferred to a position of greater danger , and some months later happily found himself en route to France . He never got as far as Paris , but was set down at Rennes , where he was put behind a desk once more , again in a motor-repair depot . Virginie could not come to visit him , because of parental objections , but Ronny managed two leaves in Paris , where he made up for the ignominy of his trooper 's uniform with prodigal tete a tete dinners with Virginie in the elegant restaurants and with substantial gifts bought from his dwindling income , in the most expensiveshops . Marriage was , for the moment , out of the question , but Ronny 's ardor , fanned by two years of devotion , could no longer be stayed , and he so far forgot the maxims of his aunts as to press Virginie , finally , for a rendezvous . After a suitable hesitation , Virginie , taking into account the perils of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniformwho might be here today and God-knows-where tomorrow , relented . But after so much waiting , so many unassuagedsighs , so many whispered nighttime conversations under lampposts and outside darkened doors , she could not relent all in one piece or in a single moment . She agreed  --  but for the future . On his next leave in Paris , when they had had time to prepare themselves properly , she promised that the event would take place . Ronny went back to Rennes , blistered with anticipation , and put in , as soon as he dared , for another leave . The leave was promised him some three weeks in the future and he made thorough arrangements , through the mails , with a small but excellenthotel , for a two-room suite with bath and even went so far as to order the dinner and the wine for the crucial eve/ping . Four years later , when he told me all this , he still remembered the exact menu and wines that he had ordered  --  smoked Scotch salmon , roast duck , cooked with peaches , salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1928 , and a Veuve Cliquot , 1919 . Something of a hypochondriac , despite his robust appearance , and fearful that the prolonged state of tension under which he was living would bring him disastrously to sick parade and hospital , he began taking long , brisk , health-giving walks in the drab purlieus of Rennes and he gave up all drink , even wine , for the three weeks . As the day grew near , despite the fact that he no longer was able to sleep more than four or five hours a night , he began to feel that he would be able to arrive in Paris in acceptable condition . His uniform glittering , his duties meticulously completed , all his rather extensive banking arrangements carefullymade , Ronny was ready to take off for Paris when the German Army , after eight months of stationary and nonbellicosewar on the Western front , struck through the Low Countries . All leaves , including Ronny 's , were cancelled , and he spent the next twenty days praying , more fervently than any general in command of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As one turning movement , one counterattack after another was crushed and swept aside by the German armor , Ronny fell deeper and deeper into apathy . When the British Army , in accordance with the modern doctrine of saving the clerks first , loaded him on a truck to a port in Southern Brittany , where , without hearinga gun fired , he was put on a comfortable excursion steamer and carried across to England , Ronny had lost all interest in the war and hardly even bothered to listen to thep185ship 's radio reports of the disintegration of the Allied Armies to the North . For six months after that , Ronny sat on a hill in Sussex , serving a tank which was parked permanently in a meadow , since its engine had long since been removed to a more active unit . Neither the tank 's immobility nor the fact that for a long time there were only four shells at the disposal of the crew in the event that the Germans appeared on the road below them served to disturb his melancholy tranquillity . Like those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but overpowering disappointment , Ronny was for that period far past caring about such remotetemporal matters as the passage of armies , death in battle , or the collapse of governments . He sat in the meadow , beside the useless weapon , among the summer flowers , agreeable , silent , smiling distantly at his fellow-soldiers , rereading the curt letters he had received from Virginie before the fall of Paris , and going over and over again the communication to the hotel manager , with the menu of the celebration dinner , of which he had kept a copy . When America entered the war and it began to seem as if , some time in the future , English armies would once more stand on the Continent , Ronny aroused himself and applied for O.T.C. , under the sensible assumption that if he ever returned to Paris , in a military condition , he would be received more gratefully by Virginie if he were in the uniform of an officer . He worked conscientiously and won his commission , in an honorable middle place in his class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a petition for a Second Front which was being circulated at that time by the Communists , although he came from an unswervingly Tory family , andp186his personal politics would have been considered medieval even by the Duke of Wellington . When I met him in London , in 1943 , he was cheerful , lively and blindly pro-American , mostly because of the fact that with the arrival in England of each new troopship from the United States , the liberation of Paris became , in his eyes , more and more of a certainty . He admired , above all , the easy American familiarity , especially pronounced at that time , with the opposite sex , although he found it quite beyond his powers to emulate it . He was one of those unfortunatemen in whom the conception of love , of sex , even , is irrevocably bound up with one woman  --  and the fact that he was separated from that woman by four years , the English Channel , and sixty divisions of the German Army , altered his attitude not at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it became plain that the Invasion was imminent , Ronny volunteered for a position of danger , garnering a promotion in the process , and managed to get himself set down on the beach on the first day . From then on he became the image of the perfect soldier , making his country 's cause completely his own , cheerfully offering himself at all times for patrols , reconnaissance , liaison and attacks , although the mission of the unit to which he was attached was not primarily combat . But I think it could fairly be said that whatever one humble lieutenant in an obscure post could do to pierce the encircling lines and drive the GermanArmy back toward the Rhine , Ronny did . On the day that Paris fell , Ronny rode into the city amid the cheers and the snipers ' fire with the first Allied troops . The driver of the small truck in which Ronny had made his entry into the capital was a forty-year-old corporal namedp187Watkins , who , although the father of five children , was sympathetically romantic , and , under Ronny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes dangerouslydeserted , sometimes swarming with celebrating Parisians , toward the address behind the Gare St. Lazare at which Ronny had last visited Virginie . There is a whole tribe of men , who , at the end of a similarquest , would have found the lady waiting , perfumed and appropriately dressed , in her living room , ready to be embraced . Needless to say , Ronny was not one of those . Virginie was nowhere on the premises and there was no one there who even remembered her . In her old apartment was living a cranky couple from Caen who took the occasion , upon hearing Ronny speak French , to complain bitterly to him about certain bombings they had undergonefrom the R.A.F.That evening , in the midst of the revelry which marked the first twenty-four hours of freedom for the city , Ronny moved absently , a fixed smile upon his lips , because he was too good and kindly a man to impose his sorrow upon his friends ' pleasure , but facing tragically the conviction that for him love was over , once and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our unit , as though exhausted by the approach to Paris , remained there , under ambiguous orders , billeted in a small hotel off the Rue de Rivoli , while the lines of battle moved farther and farther off . Ronny had the room next to mine and night after night I heard his steady , military pacing up and down , like a guardsman who is making up his mind to face his colonel and tell him he has betrayed the honor of the regiment . Then the miracle happened . While driving in the truckp188along the Boulevard des Italiens one afternoon , three or four days after our arrival in Paris , Ronny saw Virginie . She was on a bicycle and moving fast in the opposite directionand her hair was now blond , but Ronny , who had been scanning every female face in the city with the nervous persistence of a radar antenna , was not to be deceived . He waved at Watkins , who was at the wheel of the truck , to turn around . Watkins , by now himself imbued with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bicycles , jeeps and pedestrians and finally caught up with Virginie at the corner of the Rue Lafitte . Ronny jumped out of the truck while it was still moving but managed to hold his feet , calling Virginie 's name wildly and reaching out for the handlebars of her bicycle . She recognized him almost immediately and they embraced in the middle of the street , with Watkins , grinning delightedly , and a good many others , watching with interest . As Ronny admitted to me later , at that moment , standing there in the busy street , blocking traffic , with the sound of horns in his ears , holding Virginie in his arms , the war had reached its culminating point . Virginie , it turned out , had an appointment that could not wait , but she took time for a hurried drink in a nearby cafe and a conversation which Ronnie could not repeat coherently when he tried to report it to me an hour later . They made a date for six o'clock at a bar near our hotel and kissed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with giving , spent the rest of the afternoon collecting , from all possible sources , gifts for Virginie . He bought a pink scarf , although the rate of exchange was ruinous ; he traded a pair of captured German binoculars for five yards of parachute silk ; he managed to pry loosep189from a friend who had been hoarding them in his knapsack for two months , three cans of sardines ; he ordered Watkins , who was more than willing , to impose mercilessly upon his connections with certain American mess-sergeants , and Watkins turned up with a box of ten-in-one rations and a five-pound can of orange marmalade , no mean accomplishmentin a city in which everyone , soldiers and civilians alike , were on severely curtailed diets . Ronny insisted that I meet the lady , although I tried to persuade him that on this first day , while the shock of the lost years was being absorbed , it would perhaps be better for him to be alone with her . But Ronny , whose concept of happiness was involved automatically with the idea of sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments with Virginie , insisted that I meet her , at least , even if I left after a few minutes . When I got to the bar , shortly after six o'clock , Ronny was sitting tensely in a corner , sweating , alone , surrounded by his pile of gifts , looking anxiously at his watch . " She 's not here , " he said , as I sat down . " I 'm a fool . I should have told her I 'd go and get her . She probably ca n't find the bar . " " She 's been living in Paris all her life , has n't she ? " I said . " She 'll find the bar . " " I do n't know , " Ronny said , keeping his eyes on the entrance . " And then there 's the question of time . I said six o'clock but I do n't remember whether I said French time or Army time . " At that period , because of the manipulationswith daylight-saving schemes that the Germans had introduced , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the French were always an hour in advanceof us . " Maybe she was here , " Ronny said , troubledly ,  | " and hung around and gave up and went home and like an idiot I never asked her for her address .... " " Did you ask the bartender if he saw her ? " I said . " He says he has n't seen anybody , " Ronnie said . " But maybe she looked in and decided to wait outside . She 's shy and sitting in here with a lot of soldiers might have ... " He stopped and stood up , smiling tremulously . " Virginie , " he said . He shook hands formally with the girl and introduced us immediately , and carefully held her chair while she sat down . " I 'm terribly pressed , Ronneee , " Virginie said . She had a full skirt and she settled herself in little ballooning movements . She was pretty enough , although the blond hair was a misfortune and she had a wary , speculative look about her , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bet . She was a small , neat , clever-looking , big-city girl and it was hard to think of her saying good night so demurely and insistently at her door just four years before . " Would they have whisky ? " " Of course they have whisky , " Ronny said , in the tone of a man who was prepared to distill it out of his own veins on the spot if necessary . He called to the bartender for a whisky and , clumsy and beaming in front of her , began shoveling his various gifts onto the table . " I brought you a few things . A scarf , and this silk is ... " " Ah , " Virginie said , " the American rations . " She ran her hand caressingly over the carton . " So ingenious . " The look on her face changed subtly , the gambler deciding that the man opposite is not lucky . She smiled sentimentally and touched Ronny 's hand . " The same old Ronneee , " she said . " Always so thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how am I to get it all home ? " she said . " I only have a bicycle . " " I have a lorry , " Ronny said , his happiness increased by this opportunity for further service . " I 'll take you home . " " There is room for the bicycle , too ? " " Of course . " " Good , " the girl said . " Now I can stay an additional fifteen minutes . " She smiled softly at Ronny , although I still did not see the drowning look about the eyes that Ronny had described , or anything particularly French about the mouth . " I am so anxious to hear about the kind of war you have made and . . . " she looked at me significantly , " there are one or two things I wish to explain when we are alone . " I stood up . " I have to go along to dinner , " I said . " Americans , " Virginie said , smiling charmingly , " are so tactful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's approval . I left them , Ronny breathing hoarsely and talking in intimate whispers , Virginie sitting there , her eyes gently downcast , her fingers from time to time stroking the edges of the box of ten-in-one rations . I was in my room , reading , later that night , when Ronny knocked on the door and came in . He was nervous and he had obviously had something more to drink and he could not sit still , but walked back and forth uneasily on the worn rug next to my bed . " What do you think of her ? " he asked . " Is n't she marvelous ? " " Marvelous , " I said.  | " It 's that thing about Frenchwomen , " he said . " I 'm spoiled forever for English girls . " " Well , " I said , " maybe you . . . " " Can you lay your hands on a carton of cigarettes ? " he asked . " Well , " I said , " it 's pretty difficult . . . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily . " Why do you need them ? " I asked . " Does Virginie smoke ? " " No , " Ronny said . " It 's the man she 's living with . " " Oh , " I said , closing my book . " He 's a chain smoker , " Ronny said . " But he only likes American cigarettes . " " I see . " Ronny made two more trips up and down the carpet . " That 's why she was in a hurry , " he said . " He 's terribly jealous . What I mean is , after four years , and during a war and all , and she never knew whether I was alive or dead . " " Of course , " I said . " What I mean is , it would be childish to be surprised , would n't it ? " " I suppose so . " " He 's one of those dark , intense types . He rather smoulderedat me in the beginning . " Ronny smiled briefly , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginie had been claimed in his absence there was a little sense of gratification that he had finally found someone who was jealous of him . " He was in the Underground or something like that and now that that 's finished he just sits around the apartment all day , chain-smoking and keepingtrack of Virginie . Ca n't blame him , can you , with a girl as attractive as Virginie ? "  | " She does n't love him , though , " Ronny said , breathing heavily . " She told me in the truck going there . They live all the way up on top of Montmartre and that poor girl has to pedal up and down that hill in all weathers . She took him in when he was hiding from the police . Simple patriotism . And then one thing led to another . They 've been together three years , but she is n't happy . I promised the cigarettes for tomorrow . Do you think you can manage it ? " " I 'll try , " I said . " In the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " after four years . Seeing her there riding down the Boulevard des Italiens on a bicycle . They opened the marmalade and it was pathetic to see how they spooned it up . I 'm seeing her tomorrow afternoon . It 's not as though they were married or she loved-him or anything like that . What I mean is , it 's not a violation of principle or taking advantage . I mean , I declared myself long before he appeared on the scene , did n't I ? After all , if my leave had n't been cancelled when the Germans went through Belgium . . . " He allowed himself a half-sigh , remembering that inconvenient invasion . " And I 'm just meeting her in a bar . I ca n't go to their place , because he just sits there all day , chain-smoking , checking on her movements . Rum luck , eh ? " He smiled wanly , moving to the door . " After four years . A man who sits home all day . " He went out and long after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily back and forth in his room , the boards creaking sadly through the long hours of the night in trouble and love . For the next few days Ronny was of very little use to the British Army . Whenever Virginie had fifteen minutes that she could spare from her lover , Ronny would make him/self available , meeting her in bars , in front of monuments , in the lobbies of hotels , and at the approaches to whatever bridges over the Seine Virginie had to cross in her various errands around Paris . There would be hurried , murmuring , serious talks , often with Virginie holding the handlebarsof her bicycle and walking briskly with it down a street as Ronny strode alongside her , both of them followed , at a ceremonial pace , by Watkins , in the truck . Ronny would return from these tantalizing meetings redfaced , breathing hoarsely , with an obsessed glitter in his eyes , very much like the light that one might imagine as having shone in the eye of Captain Ahab as he was finally certain that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day when he was not rushing to one point or another of the city to meet Virginie , Ronny devoted his energies to the amassing of treasure from the Allied Commissaries , which he delivered dutifully , by truck , to the apartment of Virginie and her lover . They had short , amiableconversations , the three of them , Ronny said , about what it had been like in Paris under the Germans and about how clumsily the Americans were conducting the war . Virginie 's lover reserved his admiration for things American only to our cigarettes . The apartment , which was a small one , must have soon taken on the appearance of a small auxiliary depot of the Supply Services of two armies , with cases of bully beef , packaged rations , cans of coffee and cocoa powder , bottles of whisky , stacked cartons of cigarettes , and occasionally even loins of pork and cuts of beef piled all over the place , the substantial evidence of Ronny 's devotion . I am sure that if by any chance Ronny , who until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been investigated by the C.I.D. , he would have run a fair chance of being sent to jail for ten years.  |p195But  neither this nor any other consideration could sway him for a moment . There was a continual procession of shifty-eyed sergeants carrying loaded barracks bags in and out of our hotel and Watkins was kept permanently in a state of readiness to drive Ronny to Virginie 's apartment with each new acquisition . I know that Ronny dreamed of the hour when he would arrive , unannounced ( Virginie had no telephone ) , with his musette bag stuffed with cigarettesor bar chocolate , to find Virginie alone , finally , after the six years . But this never happened . He often found her lover , whose name was Emile , alone , and Emile would sometimes even go so far as to offer Ronny a small drink from the ration Scotch which Ronny had turned over to the couple , but Virginie never . Like a gambler who is deep in the hole who keeps blindly doubling his bets to get even , Ronny poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely ingenuousabout what he was doing . " I 'll tell you something , " he confided to me . " That Emile does n't really like me . Everything else being equal , he 'd tell Virginie that she could n't see me anymore . But this way , with the cigarettes and the tinned bully beef and the whisky , he 's torn . Understand , " Ronny said , " I would n't be doing this if he treated Virginie well . But he treats her horribly and I feel no compunctions . " " But you have n't done anything to feel any compunctionsabout , " I pointed out . " I'n due time , old man , " Ronny said confidently . " All in due time . " Then , the very next day , which was a Saturday , it turned out that his confidence was justified . I was washing up in my room , preparatory to going out for dinner , when Ronny knocked and came in . I knew that he had had a date withp196Virginie , in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare a quarter of an hour . Usually , when he came from seeing Virginie , he was exceptionally red-faced and booming , speaking in exhilarated half-sentences , chucklingfor no apparent reason , and moving restlessly , with a nervous excess of energy . But tonight he seemed pale and subdued and he spoke with a curious combination of languor and jumpily repressed emotion . " Well , " he said , " tomorrow is the day . " " What ? " I asked , puzzled . " I just saw her , " he said . " I 'm to come to the apartment tomorrow at three-fifteen . It 's Sunday , and Emile is going to the prize fights . He 's interested in a middleweight . It 's the only moment in the week when he leaves her alone for more than an hour at a time . There are people coming in at four-thirty , though . It 's rather split-second  --  one hour and fifteen minutes . " He smiled wanly , not looking at all like the Indian colonel . " After six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you think ? " " Yes , " I said . " It 's almost inconceivable , " he said . " Is n't it ? " " Almost , " I agreed . " My aunts would be amazed , " he said . " Would they ? " I said noncommittally . " There are chaps that do things like this every day of their lives , are n't there ? " " So I hear , " I said . " Amazing . " He shook his head . " What time have you got ? " he asked anxiously . I looked at my watch . " Ten minutes to seven , " I said . He looked worriedly at his watch . " I have thirteen minutes to seven . Do you think my watch is slow ? "  | " I 'm a little fast , I think . " He listened carefully to the ticking of his watch . " I 'd better get the right time tomorrow morning , " he said . " I told Watkins to meet me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more excited than I am . " He smiled jerkily at the thought of the loyalty of Watkins . " Tell me , old man , " he said , flushing a little , " is there anything I ought to know ? " " What ? " " I mean anything in particular ? " I hesitated , then decided that there was n't enough time . " No , " I said . " Amazing , " he said . We sat in silence , not looking at each other . " Curious , " he said . " What 's curious ? " " Next January , " he said , " I 'm going to be twenty-nine years old . " I stood up and put on my tie . " I 'm going down to dinner . Do you want to eat with me ? " " Not tonight , old man , " he said . " I do n't think I could eat tonight . " I nodded sympathetically , pretending to be more sensitivethan I was , and went down to dinner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his aunts . The next morning I was on duty and the man who was supposed to relieve me did n't appear until well after two o'clock . I had lunch in a transient officers ' mess and then , because it was a hot , sunny day , I walked leisurely , stopping often to enjoy the bright September sunlight on the old buildings and the quiet streets , toward the hotel . I was gladp198that I would be too late to see Ronny before he set out on his adventure . I had the feeling that it would be almost impossible to avoid saying the wrong thing at a moment like that , and I did not wish to complicate , by a slip of the tongue or an inadvertent smile , Ronny 's climactic hour . I reached the hotel at twenty minutes past three , and I was just going in , when Ronny came charging out of the open door . He was sweating heavily in his beautifully pressed battledress , and his face was red , his eyes were rolling , and his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He grabbed me by both arms , his hands crazily powerful , crushing my shirt . " Where 's Watkins ? " he shouted , although his face was no more than six inches from mine . " What ? " I asked , stupidly . " Have you seen Watkins ? " Ronny shouted , even more loudly , shaking me . " I 'll kill the bastard . " " What 's happened , Ronny ? " " Have you got a jeep ? " he roared . " I 'll have him court-martialed . " " You know I have n't got a jeep , Ronny , " I said . He dropped my arms and leaped out into the middle of the empty street and peered in both directions , wheeling around on his heels , waving his arms . " No transport , " he cried . " No bloody transport ! " He looked at his watch . " Twenty-five minutes past three . " The numerals came out in a sob . " I 'll have him transferred to the infantry , the swine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short , running step , back and forth in front of the hotel entrance . " I should have been there ten minutes ago . " " Did you call the garage , Ronny ? " I asked , trying to be helpful . " He was there all morning , " Ronny shouted , " washingp199the damn truck . Then he left about an hour ago . He 's probably joy-riding in the Bois with his damned blackmarketfriends . " This was a little unfair , since Watkins ' by now extensive acquaintanceship in the black market had been built up solely in Ronny 's service , but I did n't feel that this was the moment to see justice done to the reputation of the absent driver . Ronny looked at his watch once more and moaned . " He 's been driving for me for a year and a half , " Ronny cried , " and he has n't been a minute late yet . And he picks this day for it ! Do n't you know somebody with a jeep ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rustle one up if you give me an hour or so . " " An hour or so ! " Ronny laughed horribly . " There 're people coming in at four-thirty ! An hour or so ! " He gazed wildly at the blank faces of the buildings and the calm , deserted street . " What a city ! No Metro , no buses , no taxi ! God , do you know anybody who has a bicycle ? " " I 'm afraid not , Ronny , " I said . " I wish I could help ... " " You wish you could help , " he said , snarling , turning on me . " I do n't believe you . I do n't believe you for a minute . " " Ronny , " I said , reproachfully . In all the time we had known each other , this was the first unfriendly word I had heard from him . " Nobody gives a damn ! " he shouted . " You do n't fool me ! " The sweat was pouring off him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell with you all ! All right , all right , " he shouted incoherently , waving his arms , " I 'll go on foot . " " It 'll take you at least a half hour , " I said . " Forty-five minutes , " Ronny said . " What 's the difference ? If that bloody driver comes , tell him to come after me and watch for me on the street . He knows the route . "  | " Yes , Ronny , " I said . " Good luck . " He looked at me bleakly , breathing hard . Then he said something obscene and short and started running . I watched him running heavily down the sunny street , past the shuttered windows , the sturdy khaki figure growing smaller and smaller , the sound of the thick boots on the pavement going farther and farther away , diminishing , in the direction of Montmartre . He turned a corner and the street was quiet , lost in its bright , Sunday stillness . Somehow , I felt guilty , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had callously left undone , and I stayed in front of the hotel , smoking , watching for Watkins and the truck . Finally , at ten minutes to four , I saw it turn the corner and come down our street . It was thoroughly washed and polished and looked as neat as any truck could possibly be expected to look which had made the entire campaign from the beaches to Paris . Watkins , too , I saw as he drove up , had taken great pains with himself . He had shaved himself painfully close and his skin was shining pink and raw , his hair was plastered down under his hat , and he had a sly , benignant , anticipatory smile on his face as he parked the truck in front of the hotel with an unaccustomed flourish . On the seat beside him , I saw , there was a large bunch of flowers . He sprang out and saluted me smartly , still smiling . " Well , " he said , " I 'm a little early , but I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for me on the pavement . " " Where the hell have you been , Watkins ? " I asked , exasperatedfor Ronny 's sake with the man 's idiotic pleasure in himself . " Been ? " Watkins asked , puzzled . " Been ? "  | " The lieutenant called the garage nearly an hour ago , " I said , " and they said you 'd left . " " Well , " Watkins said , " I thought it might be a pleasant touch if the lieutenant carried some flowers in for the lady and I took a little tour looking for them . Carnations , " he said , pointing to them . " You 'd be shocked if I told you what they ask for them . . . " " Watkins , " I said , " you 're an hour late . " " What ? " Watkins ' mouth fell open . He looked at his watch . " The lieutenant said specifically three o'clock , and I allowed a little extra time and it 's not ten to three yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " What ? " Watkins closed his eyes , as though he could not bear to look at my face . " It 's ten to four , " I said . " Were n't you told that as of last midnight , all clocks would be advanced one hour , to coincide with French time ? " " Oh , " Watkins said in a whisper . " Oh , suffer me , suffer me . " His face looked drained and loose , like the face of a man going under anesthesia . " I heard about it during the week , but I did n't spend the night in billets , and I was off duty this morning and nobody happened to mention it at the garage . Oh , suffer me , Mother . . . Where 's the lieutenantnow ? " " At this moment , " I said , " he 's probably just passing Sacre Coeur , on the dead run . " Watkins turned slowly , like a prizefighter who has been hit and is senselessly seeking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the truck , his forehead pressed against the metal . When he lifted his head , I saw that there were tears in his eyes . There he stood , bowlegged and hunched over in his neat uniform , his scraggly , cruellyp202shaven , Cockney face twisted in grief as he thought of Ronny pounding hopelessly up the hills of Montmartre . " What can I do ? " he asked brokenly . " What can I ever bloody well do ? " " Well , " I said , " at least go wait for him so he does n't have to walk home . " Watkins nodded mechanically . Then he got into the cab of the truck , carelessly knocking the carnations onto the floor , and started the motor . He drove off , looking neither to the right nor left . Ronny got back to the hotel at six o'clock . I heard the truck drive up to the door and I looked out my window and saw him descend from the truck , slowly , without saying a word to Watkins , and move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and entered without knockingand sank into a chair , keeping his cap on his head . There were dark sweat stains around his collar and there were hollows under his eyes , as though he had n't slept in weeks . I poured him a whisky and put the glass in his hand . He did n't even look up at me , but sat there , a round , diminished , rumpled figure , staring blankly ahead of him at the stained wall above the bed . " You heard , " he said finally . " Yes . " " The Army , " he said flatly . " Whenever anything good is liable to happen to you , the Army does something . " He sat slumped in the chair , with his cap on , thinking of the declaration of war in 1939 and the collapse in Belgium less than a year later . He shook his head and took a long drink . " French time , " he muttered , obscurely . I poured some whisky into his glass.  | " I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been in this war long enough . " " What happened ? " I asked , thinking that perhaps talking about it would help him . " Nothing , " he said . He chuckled once , shortly . " I got there at five minutes past four . Watkins caught up with me one block from the house . Did you see the flowers ? " " Yes , " I said . " That was thoughtful of him , was n't it ? " " Yes . " " She was making canapes for her guests . Sardines . She had oil all over her fingers . " " Was she angry ? " " Not exactly , " Ronny said . " When I told her what had happened , she began to laugh . I thought she was going to strangle , she laughed so hard . I never heard a woman laugh like that in my whole life . " " Well , " I said , trying to be comforting , " another time . " Ronny shook his head . " No . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she said , It 's fate , Cherie , we will remain good friends . ' " There was nothing to be said to this , and I poured myselfa drink . We sat in silence . " She asked me to help her with the canapes , " Ronny said . " I opened two tins of bully beef and I cut my finger . " He held up his right hand and I saw a nasty , jagged cut , sticky with dried blood . " The only blood I 've lost in the whole damned war , " he said . " Her friends came in early . Fourfifteen . They devoured everything . I had to open three more tins of bully . They kept complaining about the American Army . Emile came in early , too . Four-thirtyfive . " Ronny by now was as conscious of time as a railroadp204engineer . " His middleweight won , " Ronny said bitterly , as though this was finally too much to bear . " A knockout in the first round . He drank three glasses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and calling me mon petit Anglais and showing me how it was done . Three lefts , mon petit Anglais , like lightning , to the nose , and a straight right , like a bomb , to the point of the jaw . The other man did n't wake up for ten minutes . He was feeling so good , Emile , he let Virginie say goodbye to me alone in the hallway . " Ronny smiled wanly . " She got sardine oil all over my battledress . And she gave me some information . She said her conscience was bothering her ; the time had come to speak frankly . She was very queer . When she talked it was as though she was having a hard time to keep from laughing . She said she had known Emile since 1937 . She has n't lived with her family since she was fifteen years old . Her family lives in Nice . They 've never been to Paris . And Emile was n't in the Underground . I got that from her friends . He smuggled butter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the chair , slowly and painfully , like a man whose bones are giving him trouble . " I 've got to get out , " he said . " I 've just got to get out . " He turned and faced me , looking at me with brooding intensity . " Do n't be surprised , " he said mysteriously , " no matter what you hear . " He went out slowly , the bones not moving very well in the martial , chubby flesh . I heard him go into his room and the springs creak as he lay heavily down on his bed . The very next day , I noticed a change in Ronny . Wheneverhe moved , he gave off a strong smell of a particularlyp205sweet toilet water , and he began to cultivate the habit of wearing his handkerchief in his sleeve . He also began to walk in a curious , short-stepped way and his speech suddenlytook on a slight lisp , very disturbing in a man who looked as though he should be leading a regiment of Sikhs . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer the long , candid conversations in my room at night . When I invited him to have dinner with me , he giggled nervously and said he was terribly busy these days . Then , a week later , I was visited by a British Medical Officer , a bleak , graying captain , who , it turned out , was a specialist in psychic disorders and cases of combat fatigue . " I wonder if you could help me , Lieutenant , " the captain said , after ascertaining that I had known Ronny for almost a year . " It 's about your friend , Lieutenant Biddell . " " Is anything wrong with him ? " I asked , cautiously , wishingRonny had briefed me . " I 'm not sure , " the captain said . " Would you say there was something abnormal about him ? " " Well , " I said , wondering how I might answer a question like that honestly without harming Ronny , " that would be hard to say . Why ? What 's the matter ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times this week , " the captain said , " with a most unusual story . Most unusual . " The captain hesitated , then decided to plunge ahead . " Well , there 's no sense in being ambiguous . He seems to believe that he should be discharged for the good of the service . " " What ? " I asked , surprised . " He claims to have discovered , quite recently , that  --  well  --  we 're both grown men , we do n't have to beat around the bush . . . " the captain said . " It 's not the first time we'vep206heard about something like this . Particularly in time of war , with men taken out of their normal life and deprived of the companionship of women for years on end . Bluntly , " the captain said , " Lieutenant Biddell claims that he finds himself attracted irresistibly to  --  uh  --  men . " " Oh , " I said , thinking , Poor Ronny ; the toilet water and the handkerchief . " The external evidence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the perfume , the manner of speech , et cetera . But he scarcely seems to be the type , although in my profession , of course , we are hardly surprised . . . You understand . At any rate , he says he 's afraid that if he remains in the . . . uh . . . military atmosphere . . . he will be tempted into an overt act . . . which would , of course , have grave consequences . I 've spoken to other of his fellow officers , and , as tactfully as possible , to his driver , and they all seem surprised . I hear that you 've been very close and I wonder if you might be able to throw light on the situation . " " Well . . . " I hesitated . For a moment , I thought of telling the doctor the entire story . Then I decided against it . Maybe , I thought , it 's really time for Ronny to get out . " I 've noticed little indications here and there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , " I added loyally . The captain nodded . " Who has n't ? " he said gloomily and got up and left , after shaking my hand . The next day , without warning , our unit was ordered to move out of Paris . At the same time , Ronny was detached from us and assigned to a headquarters in Paris , where , I presumed , it would be easier for the doctor to conclude his examination . In the confusion of the move , I did n't see Ronny , and I did n't get back to Paris until the war was over and by that time he had departed . I heard that , what/ever else had happened , he had not been given the discharge he had asked for . Somebody said that he thought Ronny had been sent back to England , but he was n't sure , and it was impossible , without compromising Ronny , to make the only kind of inquiry that would enlighten me . I was sent back to America without getting to England again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered rather sadly about my friend and speculated , not without pity , on what paths he might have strayed into in peacetimeLondon . I did not judge him harshly . It is not only twenty-four-hour barrages and being in the line without relief for months on end that destroys the will to continue in men , and in a war casualties are suffered in a variety of ways that have nothing to do with gunfire . But , occasionally , when I met a man who spoke with a little lilt or dressed in a certain , overfastidious way , I wondered if perhaps he would have been a different man at that moment if sometime in his past , at a moment of crisis , someone had arrived a half hour sooner or later . Ronny kissed the bride before the altar , then they both turned and walked up the aisle , the music swelling behind them . As he came even with me , red-faced , triumphant , tender , bull-like , he winked . I winked back , thinking , Is n't this nice ; not everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the church with his bride , I wondered if I could get the name and address of the psychiatrist from him for one or two of my other friends.  |p208CONSTANCE  SAT IMPATIENTLY IN THE LITTLE CHAIR IN THEfirst-class cabin , taking occasional sips of the champagne that Mark had sent . Mark had been called out of town and had n't been able to come , but he 'd sent champagne . She did n't like champagne , but she did n't know what else to do with it , so she drank it . Her father stood in front of the porthole , drinking , too . From his expression , Constance could guess that he did n't like champagne either . Or perhaps he did n't like this particular vintage . Or he did n't like it because Mark had sent it . Or maybe it was n't the champagne at all but just that he was embarrassed . Constance knew that she was looking sullen , and she tried to change the set of her face , because she also knew that she looked younger , childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was sure that everything she did with her face at that moment made her look more sullen than ever , and she wished the horn would blow and her father would get off the ship.  | " You 'll probably drink a lot of this , " her father said . " In France . " " I do n't expect to stay in France long , " she said . " I 'm going to look for someplace quiet . " Her voice sounded to her as though it were coming out of the nursery , wailing and spiteful and spoiled . She tried to smile at her father . The last few weeks in the apartment , while the argument had been going on and the hostility had been so close to the surface , had been painful to her , and now , in the last ten minutes before the ship pulled away , she wanted to recapture an earlier , easier relationship as far as she could . So she smiled , but she had the impression that the smile was crafty and cold and coquettish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porthole at the covered wharf . It was rainy and there was a cold wind blowing and the men on the dock waiting to throw off the lines looked miserable . " It 's going to be a choppy night , " her father said . " Have you got the Dramamine ? " The hostility returned , because he asked about the Dramamine . At a moment like that . " I wo n't need Dramamine , " Constance said shortly . She took a long drink of the champagne . The label on the bottle was impeccable , like all Mark 's gifts , but the wine was sourish and acidy . Her father turned back toward her . He smiled at her , and she thought , bitterly , This is the last time he 's going to get away with patronizing me . He stood there , a robust , confident , healthy , youngish-seeming man , looking privatelyamused , and Constance thought , How would you like it if I just got out of here and walked off this precious boat  --  how would you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father said . " If someone had only sent me to Europe when I was twenty ... " Twenty , twenty , Constance thought . He 's always harpingon twenty . " Please , Father , let 's cut that out , " she said . " I 'm here and I 'm going and it 's all settled , but let 's spare ourselves the envy . " " Every time I happen to remind you that you 're twenty , " her father said mildly , " you react as though I 'd insulted you . " He smiled , pleased with himself that he was so damned perceptive , that he understood her so well , that he was not one of those fathers whose children slide irrevocably away from them into mysterious , modern depths . " Let 's not discuss it , " Constance said , pitching her voice low . When she remembered , she always made a point of pitching her voice low . It sometimes made her sound forty years old on the telephone , or like a man . " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go to all the bright places . And if you decide you want to stay on , just let me know . Maybe I 'll be able to come over and join you for a few weeks  --  " " Three months from now , " Constance said crisply , " to this day , I 'll be coming up the harbor . " " Whatever you say , my dear . " When he said " my dear , " Constance knew he was humoringher . She could n't bear being humored there in the ugly little cabin , with the weather bad outside , and the ship ready to leave , and the sounds of people saying goodbye , laughing loudly , in the next room . If she had been on better terms with her father , she would have cried . The horn blew for visitors to go ashore , and her father came and kissed her , holding her for an extra second , andp211she tried to be polite . But when he said , very seriously , " You 'll see  --  three months from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed him back , furious with him for his obnoxiousassurance , and mournful at the same time that they , who had been so close to each other , were no longer friends . " Goodbye , " she said , her voice choked and not pitched low . " The whistle 's blowing . Goodbye . " He picked up his hat , patted her shoulder , hesitated a moment at the door , looking thoughtful but not disturbed , and went out into the corridor and disappeared among the other visitors who were streaming up toward the gangplankand the shore . When she was sure her father was off , Constance went up to the boat deck and stood there , alone in the sharp , blowy rain , watching the tugs pull the ship into the stream . As the ship went slowly downriver into the harbor and then headed into open water , she shivered in the wintry air , and , approving of herself a little for the grandeur of the sentiment , thought , I am approaching a continent to which I have no connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she approached the mid-point of the hill . She made sure that her skis were firmly in the ruts as she came up onto the flat section of packed snow where there was a short line of skiers who had come down only halfway and were waiting to pick up empty hooks and go back to the top . She always felt a little uncertain here , because if you were alone on one side of the T bar , the first person in the line would swing into place alongside you and there would be an extra , sudden pull as the new weight caught that couldp212throw you off balance . She saw that there was a man waiting for the place next to her , and she concentrated on keeping erect gracefully as he settled into place beside her . He did it smoothly , and they skidded easily past the waitingline . She was conscious that he was looking across at her , but she was too occupied for the moment with the terrain in front of her to turn her head . " Oh , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the hill again , leaning against the pull of the bar , their skis bumping a little in the ruts . " You 're the grave young American . " Constance looked at him for the first time . " And you , " she said , because everybody talked to everybody else on the hills , " you 're the gay young Englishman . " " Half right , " he said . He smiled . His face was a skier 's brown , with an almost girlish flush of blood along the cheekbones . " At least , one-third right . " She knew his name was Pritchard , because she had heard people talking to him in the hotel . She remembered hearing one of the ski teachers say about him , " He is too reckless . He thinks he is better than he actually is . He does not have the techniquefor so much speed . " She glanced across at him and decided he did look reckless . He had a long nose  --  the kind that does n't photograph well but that looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thin face . Twenty-five , Constance thought , twenty-six . No more . He was leaning easily against the bar , not holding on with his hands . He took off his gloves and fished a package of cigarettes out of his pockets and offered them to Constance . " Players , " he said . " I hope you wo n't hate me . " " No , thank you , " Constance said . She was sure that if she tried to light a cigarette she would fall off the lift . He lit his cigarette , bending over a little and squintingp213over his cupped hands as the smoke twisted up past his eyes . He had long , thin hands , and ordinarily you had the feeling that people with hands like that were nervous and easily upset . He was tall and slender , and his ski pants were very downhill , Constance noted , and he wore a red sweater and a checked scarf . He had the air of a dandy , but a dandy who was amused at himself . He moved easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the people who were n't afraid of falling . " I never see you in the bar , " he said , tossing the match into the snow and putting on his gloves . " I do n't drink , " she said , not quite telling the truth . " They have Coca-Cola , " he said . " Switzerland , the fortyninthstate . " " I do n't like Coca-Cola . " " Used to be one of the leading British colonies , " he said , grinning . " Switzerland . But we lost it , along with India . Before the war , in this town , the English covered the hills like the edelweiss . If you wanted to find a Swiss between January ist and March 13th , you had to hunt with dogs . " " Were you here before the war ? " Constance asked , surprised . " With my mother . She broke a leg a year . " " Is she here now ? " " No , " he said . " She 's dead . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the man beside her , not to ask people in Europe about their relatives . So many of them turn out to be dead . " It used to be very gay , " he said , " the hotels swarming , and dances every night , and everybody dressing for dinner , and singing God Save the King ' on New Year 's . Did you know it was going to be this quiet ? "  | " Yes , " Constance said . " I asked the man at the travel bureau in Paris . " " Oh . What did he say ? " " He said everybody was a serious skier here and went to bed by ten o'clock . " The Englishman glanced at her momentarily . " You 're not a serious skier , are you ? " " No . I 've only been two or three times before . " " You 're not one of the delicate ones , are you ? " " Delicate ? " Constance looked at him , puzzled . " What doyou mean ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Schools for delicate children . Swiss for t.b . " Constance laughed . " Do I look as though I have t.b. ? " He regarded her gravely , and she felt plump and unaustereand a little too bosomy in her tight clothes . " No , " he said . " But you never can tell . Did you ever read The Magic Mountain ? " " Yes , " she said , feeling proud that she could show she was not completely uncultured , although American and very young , and remembering that she had skipped the philosophic discussions and cried over the death of the cousin . " I read it . Why ? " " The sanitarium it was written about is n't far from here , " Pritchard said . " I 'll show it to you someday when the snow 's bad . Do you think this place is sad ? " " No , " she said , surprised . " Why ? " " Some people do . The mixture . The pretty mountains and the healthy types walloping down the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with the bad lungs hanging on , watching them and wondering if they 're ever going to leave here alive . "  | " I guess I did n't think about it , " Constance admitted honestly . " It was worse right after the war , " he said . " There was a boom here right after the war . All the people who had n't eaten enough or had been living underground or in prison and who had been frightened so long  --  " " Where 're they now ? " Pritchard shrugged . " Dead , discharged , or destitute , " he said . " Is it true that people refuse to die in America ? " " Yes , " she said . " It would be an admission of failure . " He smiled and patted her gloved hand , which was clutching tightly onto the middle bar . " You must n't be angry that we 're jealous , " he said . " It 's the only way we can show our gratitude . " Gently , he loosened her fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tight when you ski . Not even with your fingers . You must n't even frown until you go in for tea . The drill is  --  loose , desperate , and supremely confident . " " Is that how you are ? " " Mostly desperate , " he said . " What are you doing on this little beginners ' slope , then ? " Constance asked . " Why did n't you take the telepheriqueup to the top ? " " I twisted my ankle yesterday , " Pritchard said . " Overratedmyself . The February disease . Out of control and into a gully , with a great deal of style . So today I can only do slow , majestic turns . But tomorrow we attack that one once more  --  " He gestured up toward the peak , half closed in by fog , with the sun a wet , pale ball above it , making it look forbidding and dangerous . " Come along ? " He looked at her inquiringly . " I have n't been up there yet , " Constance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a little too much for me so far . " " You must always do things that are a little too much for you , " he said . " On skis . Otherwise , where 's the fun ? " They were silent for several moments , moving slowly up the hill , feeling the wind cut across their faces , noticing the quiet and the queer , fogged mountain light . Twenty yards ahead of them , on the preceding bar , a girl in a yellowparka moved evenly upward like a bright , patient doll . " Paris ? " Pritchard said . " What 's that ? " He jumps around entirely too much , Constance thought , feeling heavy . " You said you came from Paris . Are you one of those nice people who come here to give us your government 's money ? " " No , " said Constance . " I just came over on a  --  well , on a vacation . I live in New York , really . And French food makes me break out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely unbrokenout now , " he said . " You look like the girls who advertise soap and beer in American magazines . " Then he added hastily . " If that 's considered insulting in your country , I take it back . " " And the men in Paris , " she said . " Oh . Are there men in Paris ? " " Even in the museums . They follow you . With homburg hats . Looking at you as though they 're weighing you by the pound . In front of religious pictures and everything . " " Girl I knew , English girl , " Pritchard said , " was followedfrom Prestwick , Scotland , to the tip of Cornwall by an American gunner in 1944 . Three months . No religious pictures , though , as far as I know . " " You know what I mean . It 's an impolite atmosphere , "  |p217she  said primly , knowing he was making fun of her in that straight-faced English way but not knowing whether to be offended or not . " Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's amazing how many American girls sound as though they were brought up in a convent . Then it turns out they drink gin and roar in bars . What do you do at night ? " " Where ? At home ? " " No . I know what people do at night in America . They look at television , " he said . " I mean here . " " I  --  I wash my hair , " she said defensively , feeling foolish . " And I write letters . " " How long are you staying up here ? " " Six weeks . " " Six weeks . " He nodded , and swung his poles to his outside hand , because they were nearing the top . " Six weeks of shining hair and correspondence . " " I made a promise , " she said , thinking , I might as well let him know now , just in case he 's getting any ideas . " I promised someone I 'd write him a letter a day while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathizing with her . " Americans , " he said as they came to the top and slid out from the T bar onto the flat place . " Americans baffle me . " Then he waved his poles at her and went straight down the hill , his red sweater a swift , diminishing gay speck against the blue-shadowed snow . The sun slipped between the peaks , like a gold coin in a gigantic slot , and the light got flat and dangerous , making it almost impossible to see the bumps . Constance madep218her last descent , falling twice and feeling superstitious , because it was always when you said , " Well , this is the last one , " that you got hurt . Running out and coming to a stop on the packed snow between two farmhouses at the outskirts of the town , she kicked off her skis with a sense of accomplishment and relief . Her toes and fingers were frozen , but she was warm everywhere else and her cheeks were bright red and she breathed the thin , cold air with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friendly , and smiled at the other skiers clattering to a stop around her . She was brushing the snow of the last two falls off her clothes , so that she would look like a good skier as she walked through the town , when Pritchard came down over the last ridge and flicked to a stop beside her . " I see you , " he said , bending to unlock his bindings , " but I wo n't tell a soul . " Constance gave a final , self-conscious pat to the icy crystalson her parka . " I only fell four times all afternoon , " she said . " Up there , tomorrow "  --  he made a gesture of his head toward the mountain  --  " you 'll crash all day . " " I did n't say I was going up there . " Constance buckled her skis together and started to swing them up to her shoulder . Pritchard reached over and took them from her . " I can carry my own skis , " she said . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inessential points . " He made a big V out of the two pairs of skis on his shoulders , and they started walking , their boots crunching on the stained , hard snow of the road . The lights came on in the town , pale in the fading light . The postman passed them , pulling his sled with hisp219big dog yoked beside him . Six children in snowsuits on a linked whip of sleds came sliding down out of a steep side street and overturned in front of them in a fountain of laughter . A big brown horse with his belly clipped to keep the ice from forming there slowly pulled three huge logs toward the station . Old men in pale-blue parkas passed them and said " Griiezi , " and a maid from one of the houses up the hill shot out on a little sled , holding a milk can betweenher knees as she rocketed around the turns . They were playing a French waltz over at the skating rink , and the music mingled with the laughter of the children and the bells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clanging of the gong at the railroad station , announcing a train 's departure . " Departure , " the station bell said , insistent among the other sounds . There was a booming noise far off in the hills , and Constance looked up , puzzled . " What 's that ? " she asked . " Mortars , " said Pritchard . " It snowed last night , and the patrols have been out all day firing at the overhangs . For the avalanches . " There was another shot , low and echoing , and they stopped and listened . " Like old times , " Pritchard said as they started walking again . " Like the good old war . " " Oh , " said Constance , feeling delicate , because she had never heard guns before . " The war . Were you in it ? " " A little . " He grinned . " I had a little war . " " Doing what ? " " Night fighter , " he said , shifting the yoke of skis a little on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ugly black sky . That 's the wonderful thing about the Swiss  --  the only thing they shoot is snow . "  | " Night fighter , " Constance said vaguely . She had been only twelve years old when the war ended , and it was all jumbled and remote in her memory . It was like hearing about the graduating class two generations before you in school . People were always referring to names and dates and events that they expected you to recognize , but which you could never quite get straight . " Night fighter . What was that ? " " We flew interceptor missions over France , " Pritchard said . " We 'd fly on the deck to avoid the radar and flak , and hang around airfields making the Hun miserable , waiting for planes to come in slow , with their wheels down . " " Oh , I remember now , " Constance said firmly . " You 're the ones who ate carrots . For night vision . " Pritchard laughed . " For publication we ate carrots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'd locate them on the screen and fire when we saw the exhaust flares . Give me a radar screen over a carrot any day . " " Did you shoot down many planes ? " Constance asked , wondering if she sounded morbid . " Griiezi , " Pritchard said to the owner of a pension who was standing in front of his door looking up at the sky to see if it was going to snow that night . " Twenty centimetres by morning . Powder . " " You think ? " the man said , looking doubtfully at the evening sky . " I guarantee , " Pritchard said . " You 're very polite , " the man said , smiling . " You must come to Switzerland more often . " He went into his pension , closing the door behind him . " A couple , " Pritchard said carelessly . " We shot down a couple . Should I tell you how brave I was ? " " You look so young , " Constance said.  | " I 'm thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be to shoot down a plane ? Especially poor , lumbering transports , running out of gas , full of clerks and rearechelontypes , wiping their glasses and being sorry the airplane was ever invented . " In the hills , there was the flat sound of the mortars again . Constance wished they 'd stop . " You do n't look thirty , " she said to Pritchard . " I 've led a simple and salutary life . Here , " he said . They were in front of one of the smaller hotels , and he put the skis in the rack and jammed the poles into the snow beside them . " Let 's go in here and get a simple and salutary cup of tea . " " Well , " said Constance , " I really  --  " " Make the letter two pages shorter tonight , and more intense . " He took her elbow gently , barely touching it , as he guided her toward the door . " And polish your hair some other night . " They went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood table . There were no other skiers in the bar  --  just some village men sitting under the chamois antlers on the wall , quietly playing cards on felt cloths and drinking coffee out of small stemmed glasses . " I told you , " Pritchard said , taking off his scarf . " This country is being overrun by the Swiss . " The waitress came over , and Pritchard ordered , in German . " What did you ask for ? " Constance asked , because she could tell it was n't only tea . " Tea and lemon and black rum , " said Pritchard . " Do you think I ought to have rum ? " she asked doubtfully . " Everybody in the whole world should have rum , " hep222said . " It will keep you from committing suicide in the twilight . " " You speak German , do n't you ? " " I speak all the dead languages of Europe , " he said . " German , French , Italian , and English . I was carefully educated for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing the knuckles of one hand against the palm of the other , to warm them . His head was leaning against the wood-panelled wall and he was smiling at her and she could n't tell whether she was uncomfortable or not . " Let me hear you say Hi-ho , Silver . ' " " What ? " she asked , puzzled . " Is n't that what people say in America ? I want to perfectmy accent for the next invasion , " he said . " They stopped that , " she said , thinking , My , he 's a jumpy boy , I wonder what happened to him to make him that way . " They do n't say it any more . It 's out of date . " " All the best things go out of date so quickly in your country , " he said regretfully . " Observe the Swiss . " He gesturedwith his head toward where the men were playing . " That game has been going on since 1g10 , " he said . " Livingamong the Swiss is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many people ca n't stand it , of course . You remember that joke about the Swiss in that film about Vienna ? " " No , " Constance said . " What film ? " This is the first time , she thought , I 've ever called a movie a film . I must be careful . " One of the characters says , The Swiss have n't had a war in a hundred and fifty years and what have they produced ? The cuckoo clock . ' I do n't know . " Pritchard shrugged . " Maybe it 's better to live in a country that invents the cuckoo clock than one that invents radar.  |p223Time  is nothing serious to a cuckoo clock . A little toy that makes a silly , artificial sound every half hour . For people who invent radar , time is ominous , because it 's the differencebetween the altitude of a plane and the location of the battery that 's going to bring it down . It 's an inventionfor people who are suspicious and are thinking of ambush . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a serious effort to amuse you , because I 've been watching you for five days and you give the impression of a girl who cries herself to sleep several times a week . " " How much of this stuff do I put in ? " Constance asked , confused by the flood of talk , holding up the glass of rum , and carefully making sure not to look at Pritchard . " Half , " he said . " You have to have something in reserve for the second cup . " " It smells good , " Constance said , sniffing the fragrance that rose from the cup after she had measured out half the glass of rum and squeezed the lemon into it . " Perhaps "  --  Pritchard prepared his own cup  --  " perhaps I 'd better talk only on impersonal subjects . " " Perhaps that would be better , " Constance said . " The chap who receives all those letters , " Pritchard said . " Why is n't he here ? " Constance hesitated for a moment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That vice . " He sipped his tea , then put down his cup and rubbed his nose with his handkerchief . " Hot tea does that to you , too ? " " Yes . " " Are you going to marry him ? " " You said impersonal . " " So . The marriage is arranged . " " I did n't say that . "  | " No . But you would have said no if it was n't . " Constance chuckled . " All right , " she said . " Arranged . Anyway , approximately arranged . " " When ? " " When the three months 're up , " she said , without thinking . " Is that a law in New York ? " Pritchard asked . " That you have to wait three months ? Or is it a private family taboo ? " Constance hesitated . Suddenly , she felt that she had n't really talked to anyone in a long time . She had ordered meals and asked directions in railroad stations and said good morning to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and silence , no less painful because she had imposed it on herself . Why not , she thought , selfishly and gratefully . Why not talk about it , for once ? " It 's my father , " she said , twisting her cup . " It 's his idea . He 's against it . He said wait three months and see . He thinks I 'll forget Mark in three months in Europe . " " America , " Pritchard said . " The only place left where people can afford to act in an old-fashioned manner . What 's the matter with Mark ? Is he a fright ? " " He 's beautiful , " Constance said . " Melancholy and beautiful . " Pritchard nodded , as though noting all this down . " No money , though , " he said . " Enough , " said Constance . " At least , he has a good job . " " What 's the matter with him , then ? " " My father thinks he 's too old for me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A grave complaint , " Pritchard said . " Is that why he 's melancholy ? "  |p225Constance  smiled . " No . He was born that way . He 's a thoughtful man . " " Do you only like forty-year-old men ? " Pritchard asked . " I only like Mark , " said Constance . " Although it 's true I never got along with the young men I knew . They  --  they 're cruel . They make me feel shy  --  and angry with myself . When I go out with one of them , I come home feeling crooked . " " Crooked ? " Pritchard looked puzzled . " Yes .
