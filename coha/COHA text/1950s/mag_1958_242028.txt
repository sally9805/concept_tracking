In Oklahoma 's Creek County Superior Court last week , a jury of seven women and five men awarded $650,000* in damages , to be paid by the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad , to onetime Glass Plant Worker John R. Edwards , 55 . In March 1956 a Katy train plowed into the Edwards family Chevrolet at a crossing in Tulsa . There were no warning signals . The engineer blew no whistle , was traveling 35 m.p.h. in a 25 m.p.h. zone . Edwards suffered a broken ankle , ribs and jaw plus a severe brain injury that brought on mental degeneration with slipbacks at times to the mentality of a small child . His wife had her neck , right hip , both legs , both knees broken . His daughter , an American Airlines hostess , suffered a crushed breast bone , broken ankle , developed a blood clot . In March Mrs. Edwards got a $175,000 damages award . <P> The $650,000 Edwards verdict was the highest ever made in the U.S. in a personal-injury suit arising from an accident , and the most spectacular sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person-liability awards . The trend worries jurists and horrifies insurance companies , but impresses a heady new breed of trial lawyers as what one of them calls " a healthy condition-we 're beginning to realize the worth of a human life . " Caught in the legal arena in which juries are inclined to be hard on big corporations , the Katy railroad filed notice of appeal to the Oklahoma Supreme Court against Mrs. Edwards ' $175,000 award , and this week will file motion for a new trial , hoping to set aside or cut down John Edwards ' $650,000 . <P> <P> * Which , like most court judgments in personal-injury cases , is tax-free .
