About a year ago , in Raritan , New Jersey , the United States Government sold a surplus of three thousand Quonset Huts . Doubtless they have all been put to good use . Garages , tool-sheds , stores , gasoline stations and honeymoon cottages were planned . One of them became the setting for this play . A group led by HORACE LUNDQUIST , 33 , of Albert Lea , Minnesota , bought a large hut , model Q21021 . Then they rented , for sixty dollars a month , a vacant lot on Forty-ninth Street , near Second Avenue . With some donated technical assistance , the hut was set up , furnished , lit , and they live there now . The curtain rises . One side of the structure has been removed to afford a view . Behind the hut , and fastened to the adjoining building , a brightly-lit and colorful twenty-four sheet proclaims : " Better Buy Buick ! " A happy and contented American family , having done so , is piling into the shiny car . On the baseboard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Below , the hut is deserted . One lamp , which has been left burning , lights the interior dimly . It is decorated with a basic theatrical motif . Old lithograph posters , programs , and photographs are tastefully arranged . Seven cots are visible , two are double-deckers . Although they began as an identical lot , each one has acquired the personality of the man who sleeps on it . One or two are untidy , others neat as can be . One has a fancy silk spread . One has four pillows . Beside another stands a nude female dummy which is used as a clothestree by its owner . In the center of the room a long sturdy table with matching benches on either side . A silver centerpiece with flowers adds an incongruous touch . Down left , a coin-box telephone , with a high stool beside it . Pinned on the wall above it , a typewritten list . Also cupboards , closets , trunks and boxes . Off left , the shower and bathroom . Off right , the kitchen . The main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The place seems crowded and inconvenient , but cosy . There is the sound of a key in the lock of the main door . The door opens , and a young man moves into the room . JOHN TOBEY , 24 , of Boston , Massachusetts . His hair is crew cut . JOHN TOBEY ( To someone outside ) One second . ( He touches a switch and the twelve assorted lamps which light the room are on . He steps back to the doorway and leans out ) Okay now . ( A girl comes into the room , tentatively . She has beauty of a rare , striking sort . On first seeing her , only two thoughts are possible . One for men and one for ladies . Her name is URSULA POE )  --  did n't want you to trip and break your nose . ( He closes the door ) Or anything else . ( She is looking around , without expression ) I like your nose . p. 3 URSULA POE ( Tonelessly ) Or anything else . JOHN TOBEY You ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with a frown ) URSULA POE How d' you remember that kinda talk ? Must be three , four years old . JOHN TOBEY ( Smiling ) Not up in Boston , it 's not . URSULA POE Oh , Bahston ! JOHN TOBEY Sit down , Ursula . ( He indicates one of the cots . She looks at it , at him , then sits in a chair across the room . He turns away from her and loosens his belt . She watches him . He turns back to find her looking at him ) Oh . Excuse me . I must 've eaten too much . It was good though , was n't it ? URSULA POE If y'like Chinese . JOHN TOBEY  --  want a drink ? URSULA POE Yuh . JOHN TOBEY Gin ? Scotch ? URSULA POE Bicarbonate of soda . ( JOHN is slightly startled ) JOHN TOBEY ( Going out to the bathroom ) Well , I 'll see . I do n't know if  --  ( URSULA moves to one of the cots and sits . JOHN returns , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water )  --  not sure how to fix this . p. 4 URSULA POE Why ? Do n't they have bicarbonate in Boston ? ( She spoons out a dose of the powder , puts it into her mouth , then swiftly swallows some water . She hands the spoon and glass back to JOHN ) It 's all the go down here . JOHN TOBEY I think if you  --  URSULA POE ( Holding up her hand ) Wait ! ( A pause , as she waits for the effect . It does not come . She relaxes ) False alarm . JOHN TOBEY Is n't it better if you  --  ? URSULA POE ( Her hand is up again ) Hold it ! ( A long wait )  --  you sure that was bicarbonate of soda ? JOHN TOBEY ( He looks at the box )  --  what it says . URSULA POE ( Unconvinced ) I don ' know . By now I generally get the first report . JOHN TOBEY Why not lie down and relax ? URSULA POE Why not ? ( She takes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a pause . JOHN takes the bicarbonate back to the bathroom . He comes back in and moves in the direction of the light switch ) p. 5 JOHN TOBEY ( Casually ) Have you ever read anything by Thomas Hardy ? URSULA POE Not yet . ( Having reached the switch , JOHN now touches it . The room goes dark . Out of the blackness comes a loud , imperious yell ) Hey ! ! ! ( The lights go back on , instantly . URSULA is on her feet ) JOHN TOBEY He 's an English writer , ( URSULA looks at him , oddly ) Something the matter ? URSULA POE This set-up . It gives me the all overs . Reminds me of a Greyhound Bus Terminal . JOHN TOBEY I like it . Gotten to , anyway . URSULA POE What 's there t'like ? JOHN TOBEY Well , it 's this or nothing . URSULA POE How many of you in this can ? JOHN TOBEY Nine . URSULA POE All actors ? JOHN TOBEY Except Rip . He 's a designer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could show you some of his stuff . URSULA POE Not right now , thanks . JOHN TOBEY Temporarily , he 's a window dresser up at Bloomingdale 's . And he decorated all this . p. 6 URSULA POE ( Looking around ) Terrific , all right . JOHN TOBEY And then Sam , that 's his cot , there  --  he 's a writer . URSULA POE And all the rest actors . JOHN TOBEY Not many working steady right now . Just me  --  and Horace , he 's in " Kiss Me , Kate . " ( Closer to her ) You know how many members of Actors ' Equity 're unemployed right now ? URSULA POE I have n't noticed , no . JOHN TOBEY Ninety-one percent . URSULA POE How d' you all stand each other , that 's what I don ' get . Eight roommates . I got one roommate , you 've met her , Ginny ? JOHN TOBEY Sure . URSULA POE Sometimes we don ' speak three weeks at a time . Over nothing , I mean . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke , willya ? JOHN TOBEY You bet . ( He does so ) URSULA POE ( She looks around ) I see it but I don ' believe it . This town sure is loaded with the damndest sleeping arrangements . JOHN TOBEY ( Lighting her cigarette ) Horace . p. 7 URSULA POE What ? JOHN TOBEY It was his idea . He comes from Albert Lea , Minnesota  --  from a farm out there  --  and his father was in one of those co-ops , you know ? URSULA POE No , I do n't . JOHN TOBEY Co-operative ? URSULA POE So ? ( She lies back on the cot ) JOHN TOBEY So that 's how he got the idea . We used to know each other , some of us , around Patsy 's , like that , and Sardi 's . This was before I went into " Roberts . " I was flat . And things were really rough  --  every day somebody or other just has to give up and go home . Then Horace comes up with this idea and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So we chipped in and got the thing , and Horace rented the lot here and little by little we got it going . Everything 's organized . Everybody puts a third of what they make into the kitty and then if you 're out of work or anything you draw on that , see ? I mean , it 's not ideal  --  but at least it works  --  more of a stop gap , see ? ( He stops . URSULA sits up ) URSULA POE Oh , sure I know Sardi 's . ( JOHN sits beside her on the cot ) Where d' you think you 're goin ' ? ( He shifts to the edge of the adjoining cot and looks at his watch ) p. 8 JOHN TOBEY Nobody 'll be coming in for quite a while yet . URSULA POE How d' you know ? JOHN TOBEY Because . It 's my night . URSULA POE That 's what you think ! JOHN TOBEY I 've had it Sundays like this , since I 've been working . We could 've been here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POE If not for the Roxy Theatre . JOHN TOBEY Say , do you like it in there ? URSULA POE I like the sixty-four seventy a week . Steady . JOHN TOBEY But I mean , that was n't your ambition , when you came to New York , to be a Roxyette ? URSULA POE When I came to New York , Johnny , I was gon na be a great dancer . My only worry was if havin ' a spotlight on me all the time would hurt my eyes . But then it turned out there were n't enough spotlights to go around . JOHN TOBEY ( He leans over , and puts out the nearest lamp ) Was that in your eyes ? URSULA POE No . JOHN TOBEY Oh . ( He reaches to put it back on ) p. 9 URSULA POE That 's all right . Leave it . JOHN TOBEY ( Rising and moving to the back of the room , he turns out another light )  --  thought it was probably in your eyes . URSULA POE No . JOHN TOBEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ URSULA POE Johnny . ( A long pause ) What 's this I hear about you ? JOHN TOBEY What ? ( Another light out ) URSULA POE About you 're a trillionaire ? JOHN TOBEY ( Moving to another part of the room ) No .

I mean , you 're not in a position where you 've got ta save money on electricity . JOHN TOBEY I 'm what you see , that 's all . URSULA POE But if you come from money , that 's an advantage  --  so why not take it ? JOHN TOBEY I ca n't , and do what I want . Just a question of who runs my life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POE You 're young , all right . But don ' worry . From young to old it 's possible to get . From old to young is a little harder . ( He stands looking down at her ) JOHN TOBEY You 're great . URSULA POE Well , I ca n't say the same for you  --  but you 've got possibilities . ( They kiss . When they come out of it , he embraces her with all his strength )  --  you sure nobody 's coming in all of a sudden ? JOHN TOBEY I swear . ( They kiss again . There is a knock at the door . They break , sharply ) URSULA POE Oh , fine ! JOHN TOBEY ( In a whisper ) Sit still . It 's nothing . ( Another knock ) p. 11 URSULA POE There 's that nothing again . JOHN TOBEY Let me see . ( He goes to the door , opens it . A gay LITTLE ) MAN ( wearing eyeglasses and a shifty mien , walks across the threshold and into the room ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where do you think you 're  --  ? ( The LITTLE MAN sees URSULA , senses the situation , removes his hat ) MR . FINCH Excuse me . My name 's Finch . F-i-n-c-h ? URSULA POE Well , how 'd you like to scram ? S-c-r-a-m ? MR .

( She does so ) JOHN TOBEY I do n't blame you . This is n't a very romantic atmosphere , at that . URSULA POE Listen , after four shows a day with each one three precision routines in it , it 's hard to feel romantic . JOHN TOBEY  --  least they could do is give you a day off once in a a while .

And they sit around wherever they are and talk about yogi stuff  --  thought transference  --  and then somebody says they do n't believe it and so then they say think of a number and the party does  --  say , for instance , twenty-six  --  so then one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one  --  and ask for , say , the Swami Alfredo .

URSULA listens for his step to make sure he has gone , then gets up quickly and reaches for her pocketbook . She gets out a change purse , finds two nickels and goes to the phone . She drops a nickel into the slot and dials a number . While she waits , she does a few balancing steps , some high kicks , then takes a graceful ballet position ) URSULA POE ( On the phone ) Hello , Ben ? Say do me a favor holler in for Ginny , willya ?

Photographer and researcher respectively , for LIFE Magazine . LIZ is dressed in a trim suit with trousers , and a scarf around her neck . She is crisp and efficient , but bored with this particular assignment . DOROTHY , by way of contrast , is femininity itself . She started out to become a typical long-stemmed American beauty . Somewhere along the way something happened and she turned out differently . Still , she is not altogether unattractive . If only she could learn to use her limited equipment better . She smiles almost incessantly ) RIP HULETT Hello , Dorothy . Come on in. p. 70 DOROTHY PARRISH Hello , hello .

LEO MACK No idea . DOROTHY PARRISH I want to get those heads . LEO MACK So I hear . DOROTHY PARRISH We 've got a few , but they 're quite straight . p. 73 LEO MACK And that 's no good ? DOROTHY PARRISH Well , a straight head is all right if it belongs to Sinatra or Nehru . But not nobody . LEO MACK Sure sure . DOROTHY PARRISH I 'll get something .

DOROTHY PARRISH ( Smiling ) Fine . LEO MACK  --  lookin ' forward , honey . p. 76 DOROTHY PARRISH So am I. ( They continue looking at each other for a moment . LEO gives her his bite business . She laughs nervously then goes out to the kitchen , closing the door after her . LEO is thinking hard . He gets an idea . From his suitcase under his couch , he takes a small metal make-up box , moves to the table with it , then changes his mind and puts the make-up box back in the suitcase . He moves about , trying to think of a better idea . His eyes light on RIP 'S stage models atop the curtained cupboard by HORACE 'S cot . No . He sees the broom , which was left by JOHN , grabs it and starts sweeping . After a few strokes , he decides this is no good . Another moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cot , rushes into the bathroom and returns instantly with a mirror . He hurries over to the table , props up the mirror , get the make-up box from the suitcase , returns to the table , sits down before the mirror . He opens the make-up box , covers his face , excluding the upper lip , with a coat of panchromatic base , then gets out a switch of crepe hair , prepares to put on a mustache . All through the above , he keeps glancing off in the direction of the kitchen . Now he gets up , opens the kitchen door slightly , slips back to his seat and over-concentrates on his works . DOROTHY comes out of the kitchen ) DOROTHY PARRISH ( Speaking into the kitchen as she comes in )  --  as long as you 're sure you have n't caught any of those labels . ( She turns , sees LEO , engrossed , advances to him ) What 's that ? p. 77 LEO MACK What 's what ? DOROTHY PARRISH What you 're doing . LEO MACK ( Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really ? LEO MACK Yuh , I 'm experimenting with different types of mustaches . DOROTHY PARRISH Why , that 's fascinating ! LEO MACK ( Innocently ) You think so ? DOROTHY PARRISH ( Calling off ) Liz ! LIZ FARGO One second . DOROTHY PARRISH A nugget ! LEO MACK What 's a matter ? DOROTHY PARRISH Nothing . I just want a shot of this . LEO MACK ( Half rising ) Oh , no ! ( LIZ comes in ) LIZ FARGO What ? DOROTHY PARRISH Look at this  --  for maybe a mirror shot ? Say from up here  --  mirror , head , make-up box , half a mustache on  --  it 's the whole story in one crack ! LIZ FARGO Not the way I see it . p. 78 DOROTHY PARRISH Why not ? LIZ FARGO ( In a cold monotone ) Well , is n't this supposed to be one of those all-for-one-one-for-all yarns ? DOROTHY PARRISH Yes  --  LIZ FARGO So what 's a big hambo sticking on whiskers got to do with that ? LEO MACK Do n't fight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIZ gets up on the bench behind LEO ) LIZ FARGO Like from here ? DOROTHY PARRISH Is that a big head ? LIZ FARGO  --  about the biggest head I 've ever seen . DOROTHY PARRISH Well , what I want is a real choker . ( She frames her own head between her hands  --  top to throat . LEO smiles broadly into the mirror and winks at LIZ ) LIZ FARGO All right , look real  --  look real . ( She gives him a little kick . LEO takes her direction with surprising facility . LIZ is weaving about , her head close to the finder , looking for the shot . DOROTHY sits and consults her notes ) You 're not a bad looking piece of meat , at that . LEO MACK ( Softly ) Care for a slice ? ( LIZ makes the shot , steps down ) p. 79 LIZ FARGO Settle down , bub . I got a husband back in the dark room he 'd eat you raw if I told him . ( URSULA comes in ) URSULA POE John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , sugar . ( URSULA notes the action ) URSULA POE What 's all this ? ( LIZ is standing on a chair , one foot on the table ) LEO MACK They wan na make me famous , these two . I been fightin ' ' em tooth and nail , but it looks like they 're winning . LIZ FARGO That 's one thing you 're not  --  is winning . LEO MACK Oh , you 're pressing , Miss Fargo  --  ( He glances at her slacks )  --  or is it Mr. Fargo ? LIZ FARGO You 'll never know ! ( LEO looks at her with some annoyance ) URSULA POE ( Indicating the kitchen ) All right ? LEO MACK ( With meaning ) Maybe better than all right . URSULA POE What what what ?

Whoever wins this debate , I 'm gon na lose a job . ( HORACE reaches into his pocket , finds a nickel , gives it to GRANNY , who drops it into the box and dials ) LEO MACK ( To HORACE ) Keep it up , Major Hoople , you 'll get to be an Eagle Scout yet . HORACE LUNDQUIST ( Looking at LEO )  --  not a question of right or wrong . Just a question of stupid . First thing you know they 'll get wise and move the phone out . Then it 's bad for everybody . You 're ready to sell out the whole place for a lousy nickel . LEO MACK All right , all right , do n't get your nose outa joint . ( He gets the slug from GRANNY , pockets it and goes to his cot ) EV BROGAN What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . p. 94 GRANNY SCHENK ( On the phone ) Mr. D'Agostino , please Granville Schenk . Sure . ( He waits , and as he does so , closes his eyes and raises his face heavenward in silent prayer . SOL comes on ) See ' im ? SOL MARGOLIS No , but I saw his partner . The fat guy ? GRANNY SCHENK What 'd he say ? SOL MARGOLIS ( After a moment ) I don ' wan na tell you . GRANNY SCHENK What 'd he say ? SOL MARGOLIS  --  an hour and a half I waited  --  so then he came out  --  so I walked up to him and I said , " Would there be anything in your play for me ? so he looked at me and he said , " Good God ! I hope not ! " EV BROGAN  --  nice fella . GRANNY SCHENK I will make a note of his name in my Black Book . SOL MARGOLIS Thanks . ( He goes to his footlocker and looks for something ) GRANNY SCHENK ( On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message What d' you mean , do I ? My specialty No , honest , Al , I 've done a million cockneys . ( His hand goes over the mouthpiece . He looks at HORACE , who shrugs , helplessly . Back to the phone ) Uh-huh ( He covers it again and implores EV ) p. 95 EV BROGAN Do n't look at me . GRANNY SCHENK ( Back to the phone ) I see But what type of cockney is this you have in mind ? ( He covers the phone and pleads ) Solly , f'God 's sake , do me some cockney !

( SOL comes back , GRANNY calls to him ) More ! ( Into phone ) All right , all right . How 's this ? ( SOL is at the phone now . GRANNY clears his throat ) SOL MARGOLIS ( Into the phone , in authentic cockney dialect ) " ' Ere we go gatherin ' nuts in May ! What a peculiar thing to say ! ' Ow can you gather nuts in MayWhen there bloody well ai n't no nuts to gather ? " So ' ave a banahna ! ( He leaves the phone and goes back to the bathroom . SAM comes in , preoccupied . He is carrying some manuscripts . He goes to his cot ) p. 96 GRANNY SCHENK ( On the phone ) Enough ? Yes Yes Studio 9 . Eight-thirty . Tuesday and Friday . Thanks a lot , Al . Could I pick up a script in the morning ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , sure , Bella . Right .  --  I know Okay See you .

HORACE LUNDQUIST Congratulations . EV BROGAN ( Like a nasal pest ) Kin I have your auty-graph ? ( He puts the shirt , on which he has been working , away . Now he gets out a shoe polishing kit and shines a pair of shoes ) GRANNY SCHENK Twenty-eight and twenty-eight is fifty-six , less this , less that , is forty-five something . That 's fifteen for you , Horace . HORACE LUNDQUIST ( Annoyed ) What d' you mean , for me ? GRANNY SCHENK I mean for the kitty . HORACE LUNDQUIST ( Loud ) Well , then , say so ! ( LEO laughs ) GRANNY SCHENK Okay , okay . ( SOL comes from the bathroom ) If Sol gives me a hand , that is . ( SOL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his head in his arms ) p. 97 SOL MARGOLIS You wan na know something ? Everybody sleeps too much . EV BROGAN Who says ? SOL MARGOLIS It stands to reason . Say the average man lives to the age of sixty-six . EV BROGAN Yuh . SOL MARGOLIS And say he sleeps eight hours out of twenty-four . On an average , say . EV BROGAN Yuh . SOL MARGOLIS You got it ? EV BROGAN No . SOL MARGOLIS Twenty-two years ! You sleep for twenty-two years . EV BROGAN Who ? SOL MARGOLIS The average man ! You ! EV BROGAN I 'm no sixty-six . SOL MARGOLIS You may be if you live that long . Think of it ! You sleep for twenty-two years . EV BROGAN You do n't convince me . SOL MARGOLIS It 's food for thought . GRANNY SCHENK ( To SOL ) You see Broder ? SOL MARGOLIS ( Nodding ) Nothing there . p. 98 GRANNY SCHENK Connolly ? SOL MARGOLIS Yeah , but she says I 'm too short . EV BROGAN ( Suddenly interested ) Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , yuh . Too short . EV BROGAN I saw her , too . Connolly . ( Moving to SOL ) You know what she said ? Too tall !

( MIKE and MITCH come in together , go to their cots ) LEO MACK She offered me something in that  --  then I heard the figure . I said to her , " Listen , lady  --  I can borrow more a week than that ! " SOL MARGOLIS ( Suddenly , standing up ) Holy God ! EV BROGAN Now what ? SOL MARGOLIS I just realized something . You know how you go on year in year out without realizing something then all of a sudden you realize something ? EV BROGAN Like what ? p. 99 SOL MARGOLIS The average age a man lives is sixty-six . Right ? Sixty-six years old . EV BROGAN So ? SOL MARGOLIS You know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thirty-three . You know what that makes me , do n't you ? Half dead ! ( EV looks at him , nonplussed ) HORACE LUNDQUIST Can we go , fellas ? GRANNY SCHENK No Rip yet . HORACE LUNDQUIST Well , let 's go anyway . He may be held up . ( They gather round the meeting place again , in approximately the same positions as before ) Couple small things first . The LIFE gag winds up today , they tell me . They 'll be in in a while to get a shot of this meeting and then that 's all . When and if they run the stuff  --  nobody knows . Dorothy told me more stories get killed than used . EV BROGAN What 's with the dough ? HORACE LUNDQUIST That 's okay . If they use the stuff or no  --  we get another hundred and fifty . This week , I hope . MICHAEL SHANNON Thanks to me .

HORACE LUNDQUIST Well , maybe not that bad . But our legal status is weak , Jonas says . I went up to his office this morning . LEO MACK What does that cost us ? HORACE LUNDQUIST What ? LEO MACK The lawyer . HORACE LUNDQUIST  --  costs us nothing . Everything Jonas 's done for us up to now cost us nothing . He 's just doin ' it . LEO MACK Nothing for nothing . That 's fair . Are we sure this guy knows his fig from his thistle ? HORACE LUNDQUIST It 's not finished yet , Leo . The case comes up now any day . Jonas 's gon na handle that , too . And then we 'll see . Jonas says  --  ( RIP comes in ) RIP HULETT Sorry . HORACE LUNDQUIST Okay , kid . We 're talking about the trouble . Jonas says not to be too hopeful . ( He pulls out a legal document ) Here 's the answer he filed for us . I 'll read it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRANNY SCHENK We take your word . SOL MARGOLIS Is it long ? HORACE LUNDQUIST No , you 're supposed to hear it . It 's in everybody 's name . ( He begins to read . SOL , to liven up these dull proceedings , rises and does his impression of a symphony orchestra conductor , pretending the boys are the orchestra , HORACE the soloist ) " Supreme Court of the State of New York , New York County , Wilbar Realty Corporation , Plaintiff , versus Horace Lundquist , Mitchell Mack , Everett Brogan , Ripley Hulett , Samuel Crocker , Michael Shannon , Sol Margolis , Granville Schenk , John Tobey , Defendants . The defendants , answering the complaint of the plaintiff , by Gates and Block , their attorneys , respectfully show to the Court and allege : ( LEO is laughing at SOL 's antics ) " First : Deny knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the allegations contained in paragraph ' First ' of the complaint . " Second : Deny each and every allegation contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Fifth , ' and ' Sixth , ' of the complaint .

MICHAEL SHANNON Do n't get nervous , Horace  --  he was only  --  HORACE LUNDQUIST Ah , read it yourself ! ( He throws the document down on the table and goes off into the kitchen . SOL follows him off . A loud argument involving the pros and cons of HORACE 'S attitude now takes place ) LEO MACK ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorehead 's a sorehead , no matter what his name is .

SOL follows him in ) HORACE LUNDQUIST ( Still miffed ) All right  --  I 've been full of the jumps all day . p. 103 SOL MARGOLIS I 'm sorry , Horace . HORACE LUNDQUIST  --  okay . EV BROGAN Quiet ! Quiet ! GRANNY SCHENK Come on , come on ! Let 's get to the finish .

HORACE LUNDQUIST Move it where ? SOL MARGOLIS Well , we should be finding out about that , too , naturally . MITCHELL MACK Could n't we talk to the guy ? HORACE LUNDQUIST That 's the catch . What guy ? Nobody knows . You start looking . Everybody points to somebody else and you wind up in an office building on lower Broadway talkin ' to some old man who never even heard of the hut . You 're fightin ' something you ca n't see . Or even find . It 's not a guy , it 's a viewpoint . ( There is a depressed pause ) Well , we 'll see .

( JOHN has risen in his place . He is looking at LEO , hard . EV , GRANNY and the others look at him ) If there 's some reason you ca n't stand by on Wednesdays  --  we 'll switch things around .

MITCHELL MACK Come on , Johnny . Sit down . JOHN TOBEY No , listen  --  HORACE LUNDQUIST What is this ? JOHN TOBEY ( TO LEO ) He knows . Do n't you ? LEO MACK Knows what ? JOHN TOBEY I want to talk to you , Leo . This is just between you and me . LEO MACK Do n't bother me . JOHN TOBEY I will , though .

JOHN TOBEY You 're supposed to be my friend  --  ( LEO rises , starts to move away . JOHN grabs him by the arm . LEO pushes him away , roughly . JOHN lands on the couch and is ready to go at him but RIP holds him back ) LEO MACK Do n't handle me !

LEO belts him ) LEO MACK ( A scream ) Get off me ! ( HORACE grabs LEO , expertly , and starts with him toward the door . SAM and SOL , sensing that this chore may require assistance , join HORACE and try to help . There is a confused , loud scramble ) Listen , now , I 'm warnin ' you  --  ! HORACE LUNDQUIST Outside ! We 'll talk outside . MITCHELL MACK Wait a second ! HORACE LUNDQUIST Get away , Mitch ! SAM CROCKER Now now now ! SOL MARGOLIS You see what happens ? ( Progress is slow .

Across the room , SAM and GRANNY have their hands full with an enraged , out-of-control LEO . SOL and MIKE are helping JOHN to his cot . There is a considerable amount of noise and disorder .

She 'll find it . p. 109 HORACE LUNDQUIST ( To the boys ) Where were we ? EV BROGAN On the stand-by schedule . HORACE LUNDQUIST Oh , yeah .

I got ta read for Kaufman Friday . ( HORACE makes the change on the sheet ) HORACE LUNDQUIST All right , I got that . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set-up . Now she finds it . DOROTHY assists her with an extra reflector . She makes her first shot , changes position . LEO glances over , estimutes the lens position and shifts slightly into a more advantageous angle . He continues to do so throughout ) What 's with the pantry , John ? JOHN TOBEY I made out a list of what we need , only I forget who gets it . MICHAEL SHANNON Me . I 'm shoppin this week . GRANNY SCHENK I 'd like to mention about the laundry again . HORACE LUNDQUIST Yes ? GRANNY SCHENK Well , I think  --  I talked to the man from it today  --  and it 's just a question of time we 'll have to give up .

MICHAEL SHANNON I do n't know , but my wife used to get it all the time . Cheaper . SOL MARGOLIS Laundromat ! Let 's go to a laundromat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just means  --  ( LIZ makes another shot , changes position again . She finds an angle from the top of the double-decker ) HORACE LUNDQUIST Go ahead , Granny . GRANNY SCHENK It 's running now twenty-eight or nine dollars a week . SAM CROCKER Good night ! GRANNY SCHENK We ought to do our own . For a while , anyway . EV BROGAN Not me . HORACE LUNDQUIST How would everybody feel about leavin ' it out of hut charges ? Then those who want , do their own , and those who do n't do n't . MICHAEL SHANNON What 's the use , Horace ? Y'start choppin ' off everything  --  next thing you know the whole deal gets useless . HORACE LUNDQUIST Not everything . Just laundry . GRANNY SCHENK Temporarily . p. 111 MICHAEL SHANNON No , no . EV BROGAN Vote it . HORACE LUNDQUIST You want to ? MICHAEL SHANNON Sure . GRANNY SCHENK Vote it . HORACE LUNDQUIST All right , who 's for doing our own , or paying personally ? ( Three hands go up  --  GRANNY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is ? ( Six hands . MIKE , JOHN , EV , MITCH , LEO , SOL . LIZ gets the picture ) That 's it , then . But we may as well keep in mind  --  LIZ FARGO I 'm done . ( DOROTHY packs LIZ 'S case . LEO hurries over to help LIZ down from the bunk , but LIZ chooses to get down on her own ) HORACE LUNDQUIST Thanks . DOROTHY PARRISH And thank you , all . I ca n't say it about every assignment I get  --  but this one 's been really enjoyable . LIZ FARGO I ca n't say it about this one , either . But good luck to you . You 're all right .

HORACE comes over to her ) p. 112 HORACE LUNDQUIST Thanks for everything . I 'll keep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . ( She goes , following LIZ , and followed by a chorus of farewells . LEO sees her to the door , touches his cheek to hers in a quick embrace . Now , the girls are gone ) HORACE LUNDQUIST ( Continuing ) So we go on as is with the laundry . ( MIKE raises his hand ) Mike ? MICHAEL SHANNON  --  like to say a few words about eggs . Now , I know white eggs are more expensive than brown eggs  --  LEO MACK ( From the doorway ) Hold it a second . ( He kicks the door closed ) I 'd like to say a few words about some unfinished business . MITCHELL MACK Calm yourself , Leo . LEO MACK You pipe down . GRANNY SCHENK Okay , it 's all over . You got your laugh . LEO MACK It 's all over but I 'm out a punch . ( He takes off his jacket , drops it on the nearest cot ) EV BROGAN Sit down , Leo . p. 113 LEO MACK Make me . ( There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MITCHELL MACK Please , Leo . EV BROGAN Ca n't we just talk ? LEO MACK Sure , we can talk . Now , as I understand it , I got the same rights in this can as anybody . HORACE LUNDQUIST Nobody said no on that . LEO MACK All right . My hundred and twenty 's in like everybody 's . And I been kickin ' in the one-third like everybody . So . EV BROGAN So ? LEO MACK So I do n't wan na get pushed around by no God damn Queen Bee ! HORACE LUNDQUIST Meaning me ? LEO MACK If the shoe fits  --  HORACE LUNDQUIST Go ahead . LEO MACK That 's all . ( A pause ) HORACE LUNDQUIST All right , you 've said what you think , Leo  --  so now here 's mine ! I think you 're a liar . And a crook , and a chiseler . What 's more , a mean , selfish no-good  --  and I can prove it . Also , you 've wrecked this place . Maybe if one lousy lug could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel bad just the same . p. 114 LEO MACK You said something about prove it . HORACE LUNDQUIST That 's right . LEO MACK Okay . You 're on ! ( HORACE rises , hesitates for a moment , looks at MITCH , then turns away in disgust ) HORACE LUNDQUIST Ah , the hell with it ! ( He goes out to the kitchen ) LEO MACK ( Shouting after him ) Prove , it , you said ! So far you 're just talkin ' a lotta shorthand . ( HORACE comes back . The atmosphere is tense ) HORACE LUNDQUIST ( Moving to LEO ) All right . You came in here with a lotta cock and bull about how you quit in Detroit and had to do all that paying . The truth is you were paid off and let out . So you came here with a couple hundred , anyway , in your kick . That makes you a liar . ( LEO is stunned and surprised at this revelation . The emergency is of a familiar sort and he handles it without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) On top of that , you been takin ' fives and tens off every man in the place . That makes you a chiseler . Then you did a Philco show and never mentioned it . So the fund is out its cut . So you 're a crook . p. 115 LEO MACK Why did n't you tell me you were J. Edgar Hoover ? HORACE LUNDQUIST Nobody in here 's an angel . Everybody 's done something on the in-and-out side . It 's never mentioned . In the end it comes out all right . But you look to me like hopeless . That 's why I 'm tellin ' yuh . In all the time you 've been here  --  not one damn thing have you done to fit in or give a hand . So in my book  --  you 're the worst kinda guy there is . ( He goes back to his place at the table . LEO watches him , menacingly ) LEO MACK You want me out of here , that 's the idea , huh ? HORACE LUNDQUIST What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , but I 'm stayin ' . Unless you wan na gim me my dough back  --  then I 'll go . HORACE LUNDQUIST Your dough ? Mitch borrowed it for you from the Morris Plan with me as co-maker . LEO MACK ( Loud ) It 's my dough just the same . I 'm staying . Not because I like it  --  but just to burn your behind , see ? HORACE LUNDQUIST It 's up to everybody , not just me . RIP HULETT Why do n't you just go , Leo ? We 'll pay you off as soon as we can . p. 116 LEO MACK No . That 's what I say to that . No ! EV BROGAN ( Rising ) If anybody wants my opinion  --  MITCHELL MACK ( Rising ) This is no time to talk about anything . Everybody 's too hot . LEO MACK I 'm not hot !

HORACE LUNDQUIST How much room ? LEO MACK Run your own life . It needs it . HORACE LUNDQUIST That 's right . LEO MACK ( To HORACE ) Big fat cornfed scoutmaster .

HORACE LUNDQUIST  --  SO long as anybody 's got any use for it . EV BROGAN One question , then I 'll clam , okay ?

If all the good ones in the world were beautiful and vice versa . ( He illustrates , graphically ) And if every time you did something bad you got a little uglier or a boil or something Or vice versa . ( MIKE comes in . He carries a large manila envelope , and is obviously depressed ) EV BROGAN ( In a brogue ) Michael , me b'y ! Where 've you been ? p. 123 MICHAEL SHANNON I been to London to visit the Queen .

If you want it . Get ready for some eyebrow exercises . ( From the envelope , MIKE takes a copy of LIFE Magazine and slams it down on the table . The boys slowly move in . Even before they see it , they know what it is . They stare at it for a moment before anyone touches it ) HORACE LUNDQUIST ( Softly ) Oh , my God ! p. 124 GRANNY SCHENK ( Picking up the magazine ) Oh , Doctor ! You hit a nerve ! SOL MARGOLIS It figures . I tell you , it figures . ( On the cover is an almost life-size head of LEO , handsome as sin . It is one of the mirror shots we saw made .

( LEO goes to his cot , drops the papers and bag and begins to undress , starting with his shoes . He gets the left one off , then stops to survey the glum room ) LEO MACK Somebody 's birthday ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( HORACE picks up the copy of LIFE and tosses it a few inches forward on the table in the direction of Leo . LEO limps over to it in a small burst of anticipatory excitement . He looks at the magazine as the roommates look at him . Then he looks around at them with a half-sob , half-laugh . He drops onto the cot , turns to the layout inside , scans it , then gives his attention to the cover once more . SOL comes back in . Finally , LEO MACK ( speaks  --  more to himself than to anyone ) p. 127 LEO MACK Well well well . I rest my case . HORACE LUNDQUIST Congratulations . LEO MACK Do n't mention it . MITCHELL MACK They want you to call Operator 83 Los Angeles . LEO MACK Me ? MITCHELL MACK You know what it could be ? ( LEO hurries over to the phone , his shoe still in his hand . He drops a nickel into the phone and dials long distance . SOL , a deck of cards in his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( EV joins him at the table . SAM has gone to work on his typewriter ) LEO MACK ( On the phone ) Hello , this is Leo Mack , M-a-c-k , Eldorado 5-6285 and I 've got a thing here to call Operator 83 in L.A.

He was very nice , though , had Kazan there , too . HORACE LUNDQUIST Well , that 's something at least , huh ? RIP HULETT Something . ( He takes his things to the table . As he puts them down he sees the copy of LIFE and reacts properly ) What the hell is this ? LEO MACK What the hell does it look like ? EV BROGAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone . RIP looks around the room . Now , with a rueful snort , he goes to his cot . He takes some laundry down and goes out to the kitchen to iron it ) LEO MACK Hello Yes ? I 'm holding on ( There is a knock at the door . MIKE opens it and two strange men walk in . One is tall and elegant with a pale face and a bass voice . He wears horn-rimmed eye-glasses , a straw hat . The other is a thin shadow of the first . The former is , of course , BRIAN FREER . The latter is a hanger-on called HARRY HOLLAND . They look around the room , searching for a face . They find it when they spot LEO at the phone ) LEO MACK Hello Operator 83 Los Angeles ? This is  --  p. 129 BRIAN FREER Hang up ! LEO MACK What ? HARRY HOLLAND Hang up , he said . LEO MACK ( Into the phone ) Just a second . ( To the men ) Do I know you ? BRIAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hurt yourself .

BRIAN FREER ( After an impressive pause , speaks reverently ) I am Brian Freer . ( LEO is impressed . The boys react with great interest ) LEO MACK ( Holding out his hand ) Glad to see you , Mr. Freer . I 'm Leo Mack . BRIAN FREER ( After a nod at the hand ) Not his brother ? LEO MACK ( Embarrassed ) You know how it is . BRIAN FREER ( Magnanimously ) Of course , of course . Sit down . ( LEO does so . FREER studies him ) . Look over there . ( LEO does so . FREER examines his left profile ) Other side . ( LEO does so ) Now to me . ( LEO looks at him ) Big smile . ( LEO smiles . FREER leans back , satisfied ) Fine . Fine . You are a very good looking boy , in my opinion . All-American type . p. 131 LEO MACK ( Shy charm ) Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MACK In what way ? BRIAN FREER Because I came in when I did . Who was that on the coast ? LEO MACK I do n't know . BRIAN FREER ( Rising , suddenly angry ) Now , listen , cutie ! Don ' you be cute with me ! I 'll walk out of here in two minutes ! ( He walks toward the door ) HARRY HOLLAND Mr. Freer 's a busy man , son . BRIAN FREER ( Coming back to LEO , pointing a warning finger ) If I 'm gon na handle you do n't you be cute with me . HARRY HOLLAND ( To SOL , confidentially )  --  handles only the biggest . LEO MACK ( Frightened ) I do n't know , Mr. Freer . I swear to you , I do n't know . I just got a message . Operator 83  --  ( Pointing to phone )  --  that 's all . HARRY HOLLAND ( To Freer ) He just got this message , Brynie , see ? p. 132 BRIAN FREER ( To LEO ) Why did n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a tip on you from the magazine . Day after tomorrow , the book comes out  --  you 're on the cover  --  you 're hot .

HARRY HOLLAND  --  in three , four figures . BRIAN FREER That 's why I say you 're a lucky boy I happened to walk in on time . ( He indicates the phone ) That was no doubt some early bird lookin ' for the worm . Those guys on the coast , they get galley proofs , manuscripts , advance magazine copies  --  all like that . It 's a race , see ? Now . The time is now about  --  ( HARRY looks at his watch ) HARRY HOLLAND Twelve-twenty . BRIAN FREER Twelve-twenty . Nine-twenty on the coast . That 's not office hours , you understand . ( The phone rings . GRANNY goes to answer it ) So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the phone . Fast talks you . He says a number  --  p. 133 GRANNY SCHENK ( On the phone ) Yes ? BRIAN FREER ( Continuing )  --  you get panicky  --  you say yes  --  GRANNY SCHENK ( On the phone ) Moment ( He glances at list on wall ) BRIAN FREER  --  you 're hooked . GRANNY SCHENK ( On the phone ) Swami Constantine spiks ! Your nomber iss nomber thirty-four Beware ! Farewell ! ( He hangs up and goes back to his place . FREER and HARRY look at him , and at each other , astonished ) BRIAN FREER ( Back in stride ) He says a number  --  you get panicky  --  you say yes  --  you 're hooked ! Now the picture is different  --  because I 'm in it . I 'll fix it you get three times as much and conditions and protection and prestige of the office so nobody boffs you around . LEO MACK I see . BRIAN FREER That is , if you want me . LEO MACK ( Rising ) Well , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let me work it . ( They shake hands ) LEO MACK Fine . BRIAN FREER Now I got to ask you one important question and give me the answer plain . It 's important to me and to you , also . It 's this . Can you act at all ? LEO MACK ( Sincerely ) Mr. Freer , I 'm going to be frank and honest with you . BRIAN FREER That 's what I like . LEO MACK I am probably the best young actor in America today . ( FREER throws a startled look at HARRY . GRANNY tumbles from the top of his double decker and throws a withering look at LEO as he goes off to the bathroom ) BRIAN FREER That 's all , brother ! You can speak a line like that with your straight face , I do n't personally care if you stink ! HARRY HOLLAND ( Nodding sagely ) I know what you mean , Brynie . BRIAN FREER ( To HARRY ) A man can speak a line like that with his straight face , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped worrying about you . ( He moves away ) p. 135 LEO MACK Okay . BRIAN FREER ( Coming back to LEO ) We 'll fix it up on paper tomorrow . It 'll be the standard deal  --  you 're fully protected by SAG . HARRY HOLLAND Screen Actor 's Guild . BRIAN FREER But .

Only do n't con me  --  do n't hold back  --  if you do  --  I throw my weight . HARRY HOLLAND And you 're dead . LEO MACK I understand . ( LEO shakes hands with FREER again , just to make sure . Now he holds his hand out to HARRY , who refuses it ) HARRY HOLLAND I 'm not with the agency . ( He walks away ) BRIAN FREER He 's got nothing to do with anything . Just a friend . Y'made your deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRIAN FREER Better get me Operator 83 L.A. , and let 's see what we got . LEO MACK Mitch ! Get a drink for Mr. Freer . This is my brother , Mitchell , Mr. Freer . ( FREER gives a slight nod . GRANNY , naked except for a bath towel around his middle , crosses from the bathroom to the kitchen . FREER watches him for a moment , then turns away without comment . LEO dials long distance . He is in a fever of excitement ) Long distance ? Get me Operator 83 L.A. That 's it . ( To MITCH ) Come on , Mitch , move ( FREER sits ) p. 136 MITCHELL MACK ( To FREER ) What would you like , Mr. Freer ? HARRY HOLLAND If you 've got any good Scotch , Scotch .

LEO MACK Well , just what have you in mind , Mr. Trilling ? BRIAN FREER All right , now let him talk a while . ( MITCH returns with a drink of Scotch in one hand , a glass of water in the other . ) BRIAN FREER ( takes the liquor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ignores the water ) BRIAN FREER ( To LEO ) Now , you 're interested and would he please discuss it with your agent , Brian Freer .

Well , I certainly am interested  --  but would you please discuss it with my agent , Brian Freer ? That 's right No , he 's right here with me now . Just a moment , please . ( FREER gets up , goes to the phone . LEO hands him the receiver and steps back . FREER , with a commanding gesture , indicates the spot for LEO to stand . LEO obeys . Now Freer turns to the phone , clears his throat . It is instantly apparent that he speaks two languages . One for clients , another for executives ) p. 138 BRIAN FREER ( Caressingly ) Hello , Steve Fine , and you ? How 's Vi ?

BRIAN FREER Just see y'don ' learn too much . ( He looks around . RIP comes back in with his laundry ironed . He puts it in his foot locker and prepares for bed . FREER speaks to LEO ) You have to live here or you like it ? LEO MACK Three guesses . BRIAN FREER How broke are you , boy ? LEO MACK How broke can you get ?

LEO MACK Give me a hand , Mitch . Take me two minutes , Mr. Freer . ( With the fervor of a man suddenly released from prison , he begins to pack ) BRIAN FREER No rush . ( He strolls around the hut in idle curiosity ) HARRY HOLLAND Maybe we 'll stop in to the Stork , see who 's there . BRIAN FREER Maybe . HARRY HOLLAND You gon na slam this fast , Brynie , or tease ' em a little ? ( LEO hurries to the bathroom to collect his things ) BRIAN FREER Three , four days the most  --  could get too cold too fast . One week passes and how do you know who has LIFE got on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOLLAND Naturally . BRIAN FREER No , this we sew up one two three . ( As he passes EV , EV takes his attention . EV half-rises , shows him first his left profile , then his right , then a broad smile , looks at him eagerly . FREER shakes his head and walks away . EV sits down again ) HARRY HOLLAND Trilling was hot , huh ? ( LEO comes from the bathroom , crosses to his cot ) p. 141 BRIAN FREER  --  firecracker . Probably close with him tomorrow . ( MIKE , wearing a thick false mustache , steps up to FREER ) MICHAEL SHANNON Can you use a heavy ? ( FREER looks at him , turns away . MIKE takes off the mustache ) Would you like to buy a second-hand mustache ? ( He holds it out . Again FREER just looks at him and turns away without answering ) Regards to Vi .

( MITCH turns away , and goes into the bathroom ) Suit yourself . ( To HARRY , indicating his suitcase ) Grab that , will you , son ? ( FREER 's arm is around him as they leave . HARRY picks up the suitcase and follows them . HORACE closes the door , picks up his luggage , brings it back to his cot , opens it to unpack .

( He goes ) MICHAEL SHANNON Listen , I know a woman killed her husband and did n't get caught  --  the only thing she got was the insurance  --  she lived on our block . Everybody knows it . So what does that prove ? ( A pause ) EV BROGAN That everybody should kill their husband for the insurance . GRANNY SCHENK ( In his bunk ) My trouble is I got no husband . If I did , he would n't live through the night . ( MITCH is unmaking LEO 's bed ) p. 145 EV BROGAN Sick man , that Leo . MICHAEL SHANNON What he needs is a good head doctor .

SOL MARGOLIS ( Pushing his head in ) New York , are you through ? EV BROGAN Get off this line , operator ! ( He gives SOL a shove . MITCH does his sound effect .
