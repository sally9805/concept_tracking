How beautiful to do nothing , and afterward rest up . <P> The old Spanish proverb does not work out if doing nothing is carried too far . In a small attic office at McGill University in Montreal , Psychologist Woodburn Heron pays students $20 a day to lie on a soft bed in a soundproofed , air-conditioned cubicle . The students ' eyes are covered by translucent goggles so that they see only a foggy glow . On their hands they wear cardboard gauntlets over thick gloves to deaden their sense of touch . <P> Dr. Heron 's purpose is to find out by experiment how the brain behaves when deprived of fresh and varying stimulation from the senses . The problem is a practical one . Men watching radar screens on which nothing changes for hours often fail to see a strange blip when one appears . Many auto drivers are " hypnotized " into crackups by long hours behind the wheel on monotonous highways . <P> Bed of Boredom . The McGill experiment tries to measure the malfunctioning . The students generally sleep during their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they grow more and more restless . They squirm , whistle , sing , talk to themselves . They welcome any interruption , as when they are asked over an intercom to do mental arithmetic . <P> When interruptions cease , some of the victims try desperately to think about their studies , or to occupy themselves with intellectual problems . For the most part , they fail . Little by little their brains go dead or slip out of control . They can not concentrate ; their thoughts wander aimlessly . Their arithmetic drops to primary-school level . <P> Strange hallucinations , like waking dreams , creep into their minds . The students see patterns of dots or lines . Then , as the empty hours drag on , livelier visions appear . They may see rows of little yellow men with black caps and open mouths , or a procession of squirrels with sacks on their backs marching across the snow . The students have reported seeing prehistoric animals , weird cities , a pair of disembodied hands coming out of the ground . One student saw a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raft . <P> For Darker Purposes ? The visions are intensely real ; so are the voices and music that come out of nothingness . One student was fired upon by a small rocket ship , and he felt the pellets striking his arm . Two students reported a strange sensation : each felt that two bodies were lying side by side on the bed , " as if there were two of me . " Some of the victims have stuck it out for six days , with only short respites for food . Some , in spite of the $20 wage , have quit after one day . As soon as they leave the cell , the hallucinations stop ; the squirrels and little yellow men march away forever . But not for hours do the victims get back to normal . They have headaches , can not study , lose their skill at handwriting . Sometimes such effects continue for 24 hours . <P> Dr. Heron is doing a specific and limited experiment , and he does not intend to speculate . But it has occurred to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by starving it of sensation might be used , with proper modification , for darker purposes . It might explain the Communists ' success in getting untrue but apparently willing " confessions " out of prisoners led into a courtroom right out of isolated cells .
