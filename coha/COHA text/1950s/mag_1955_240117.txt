Names make news . Last week these names made this news : <P> After a stretch in a Parma jail , Italy 's serious-minded Humorist Giovanni ( The Little World of Don Camilla ) Guareschi , sentenced to twelve months for libeling the late Premier Alcide de Gasperi , was sprung conditionally , time off for good behavior . Matter of principle : given a chance to ask for a cut in his sentence last October , Prisoner Guareschi , in no mood for apologies or parole pleas , politely declined the opening , doggedly stuck to his cell . <P> To spice up the evening appearances of youngish ( 50 ) Cinemactress Marlene Dietrich at a plush London nightclub , the resourceful management hit on the idea of dragging in a celebrity at each show to introduce Grandma Marlene . Last week 's hit curtain-raiser was Liverpool 's burly ( 208 Ibs. ) , two-hourglass-figured ( 50 in. , 40 in. , 50 in . ) Labor M.P Bessie Braddock ( TIME , May 9 ) , honorary president ( she says ) of a professional boxers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus . Bessie togged in her usual drab blue suit , swept past the club 's haughty doormen , bounced inside to utter some dock-walloper pleasantries . To some of London 's uppercrustiest , amazonian Mrs. Braddock announced : " I intend as a reciprocal arrangement to invite Miss Dietrich along to the House of Commons . " Society patrons responded with a hoarse cheer so blatant that Marlene , entering in a bit of gossamer so diaphanous that Britain 's press fears to publish photos of it , was scarcely noticed . Later , Battling Bessie and Marlene chatted cozily . With no apologies for her proletarian garb , Bessie said : " I just had time to wash my face . " <P> With a stern eye on juvenile delinquency and a strong hope of raising the physical standards of U.S. youth , a golfer named Dwight Eisenhower invited 32 sports leaders to come to the White House this week and help him plan how to lure more young Americans into competitive sports . Among those on the guest list : Golfer Bobby Jones , former Heavyweight Champion Gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trabert , Track Stars Mal Whitfield and Wes Santee , Light-Heavyweight Champion Archie Moore , National Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick , U.S. Women 's Amateur Golf Champion Barbara Romack , Navy Football Coach Eddie Erdelatz , U.S. Open Golf Champion Jack Fleck , onetime U.S. Sculling Champion John B. Kelly ( father of Oscar-winning Cinemactress Grace Kelly ) . <P> After nearly nine years of ostensibly happy though businesslike marriage Publisher ( Look ) Gardner Cowles , 52 , and his editor ( Flair ) wife , ex-Adwoman Fleur Fenton Cowles , surprised even their intimates by agreeing to " a very amiable , friendly separation ... no immediate plans for divorce . " A girl wonder at 16 ( when she landed a $100-a-week advertising job ) , Fleur recently signed a new three-year contract to stay on as associate editor of Look , will also remain as a director of Cowles Magazines , Inc.
