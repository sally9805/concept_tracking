Spain has bred more than its share of eminent modern artists , among them Picasso , Jon Mir , Juan Gris and Salvador Dali . But most of them have hotfooted it across the border to France almost as soon as they were old enough to carry their own easels . The artists who stayed behind seemingly found it difficult to forget Spain 's great artistic past , and followed , without distinction , the traditions of El Greco , Velasquez and Goya . <P> Last summer , at Venice 's big Biennale , gallerygoers got a glimpse of a fresher trend in Spanish painting , the work of a stay-at-home named Benjamin Palencia . Palencia 's boldly colored , unsophisticated commentaries on Spanish country life were neither hidebound nor self-consciously revolutionary . This spring when Palencia , now 50 , had a one-man show at Madrid 's Museum of Modern Art , critics boasted : " Spain has a great new painter . . . the richest temperament since Goya . " <P> Palencia began his straightforward observations of rural Spain as a child herding sheep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started on his famous travels . At nine , Palencia 's sketches of animals and lively peasant fiestas caught the eye of Don Rafael Lpez Egoniz , a well-to-do Spanish engineer and art collector . He persuaded Benjamin 's parents to let him take the youngster back to Madrid as his ward . There he set the boy to studying the great Spanish masters , but carefully kept him out of Madrid 's traditionalist art schools . Later , he took him on a three-year tour of Europe , introduced him to Paris ' heady artistic life . Unlike his expatriate countrymen , Palencia found more excitement in Spain 's plateaus and peasants than in Paris ' studios and cafs , shortly returned to his native land . " I need gaiety and purity for inspiration , " he said , " just as I need space and sun . " Back in Spain , he packed his easels and brushes , began taking treks through the countryside " like a hungry animal in search of beauty . " <P> This week , with his successful Madrid show behind him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer headquarters in an old mill on a hilltop near Avila , he starts out each morning accompanied by an old shepherd who guides him along mountain trails until he finds some scene that catches his eye . By autumn , he hopes to have 30 or 40 new sun-and space-filled canvases for next year 's show in Madrid . " I am still far from reaching total maturity , " says white-haired Palencia . " But I am on the right path . "
