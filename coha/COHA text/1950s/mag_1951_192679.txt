White House correspondents , watching a pressroom TV set while the New York Giants battled the Brooklyn Dodgers , got a special summons to the office of Presidential Press Secretary Joe Short . Short looked gravely through his spectacles , and began reading from a paper before him . " Another atomic bomb has recently been exploded within the Soviet Union , " he read . " This event confirms again that the Soviet Union is continuing to make atomic weapons . . . Further details can not be given without adversely affecting our national security interests . " <P> The Hint . Three days later , a Pravda reporter got further details from Joe Stalin himself . Asked the reporter : " What is your opinion of the hubbub raised recently in the foreign press in connection with the test of an atom bomb in the Soviet Union ? " Replied Stalin : " Indeed , one of the types of atom bombs was recently tested in our country . Tests of atom bombs of different calibers will be conducted in the future as well . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands for outlawing atomic bombs . Most Russians do not know that the U.S.S.R. has wrecked all plans for international atomic disarmament and control by refusing to agree to international inspection of atomic plants ; since 1947 , the U.S. has offered to share its atomic science with the United Nations on the basis of strict inspection and control . <P> The U.S. , which had gone into a flap when the first Russian bomb was exploded two years ago , accepted the news of Bomb No. 2 for what it was worth . The atomic pundits speculated that the blast had gone off some time within the last month , were surprised that it had n't come sooner . By now , they estimated , Russia may have stockpiled between 20 and 100 bombs . Stalin 's reference to " different calibers " was taken as a hint that Russia , too , was on the trail of tactical atomic weapons . <P> Stalin had hardly spoken , before a House Appropriations subcommittee released testimony by Chairman Gordon Dean of the Atomic Energy Commission that U.S. tactical atomic weapons are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atomic artillery shells , guided missiles , torpedoes , rockets and bombs for ground-support aircraft , among others . . . big ones for big situations and little ones for little situations , " said Dean . " Given the right situation , and a target of opportunity , we could use an atomic bomb today in a tactical way against enemy troops in the field , without risk to our own troops . " <P> Third Force . In a speech at Los Angeles , Dean eloquently broadened the concept . " Millions of people throughout the world . . . have feared that the only two alternatives left to mankind are gradual submission to persistent Communist encroachment ... or atomic obliteration . . . We now have the third possibility of being able to bring to bear on the aggressor himself-at the place of his aggression ... a firepower that should cancel out any numerical advantage he might enjoy ... If we can prevent all-out war by means of our strategic capability , and stop these endless nibbling aggressions with our tactical capability , we will have done much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an uneasy world .
