Is the U.S. going to develop a world economic policy to support its political objectives ? This question was crystallized last week by President Eisenhower 's foreign-trade message to Congress . If the program he recommended goes through Congress , the U.S. will have made a belated start toward a foreign economic policy . If not , a major gap in U.S. foreign policy will become more conspicuous than ever . <P> The President 's recommendations to Congress followed closely the report of Steelmaker Clarence Randall 's Commission on Foreign Economic Policy ( TIME , Feb. 1 ) . Said the President : " This program consists of four major parts : aid , which we wish to curtail ; investment , which we wish to encourage ; convertibility , which we wish to facilitate ; and trade , which we wish to expand . " He asked Congress for legislation on these major specifics : <P> I Extend the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act for three years , with new presidential authority to negotiate tariff cuts up to 5% a year and to make other tariff adjustments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign operations of U.S. firms . <P> Allow foreign firms to compete for U.S. Government business . <P> On Capitol Hill , congressional leaders expected Chairman Daniel Reed of the House Ways &; Means Committee , a dissenter on the Randall Commission Report , to bury freer trade legislation with either silence or a mass of endless testimony at public hearings . <P> Speaker Joseph W. Martin hoped to postpone the issue until next year . He was in no mood to repeat last year 's performance on the excess-profits tax , when he had to wrest working control of the Ways &; Means Committee away from Dan Reed . This year old Dan has gone along with the Administration 's social-security expansion program . Martin does not want to repay Reed by opening an all-out fight against him on tariffs . <P> So the program will be lost unless President Eisenhower goes to the people with a ringing explanation of the importance of freer trade to U.S. foreign policy .
