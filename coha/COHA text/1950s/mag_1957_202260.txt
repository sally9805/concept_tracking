When the U.N . Disarmament Subcommittee doggedly assembled in London last March , most observers conceded it no more chance than any other of the innumerable futile sessions the West had held with the Russians over the past eleven years . Europeans remarked sagely that the Eisenhower Administration had found an ideal job for Harold Stassen-all talk and no action . But the slow recognition that this time the Russians might be serious* has made everyone suddenly cautious . The Russians had accepted , at least in broadest principle , Eisenhower 's " open skies " inspection and offered for the first time to admit international observers to Russian territory to check on bomb testing . Last week Western governments found themselves re-examining a question they had not seriously considered for years : Does the West really want disarmament ? <P> In the classic sense of destruction of tanks , warships , guns , most Western capitals found that their answer was no : as Macmillan recently told Bulganin , the arms buildup could hardly stop until the legitimate political fears that produced it had been overcome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly speaking , disarmament , but the development of a dueling code . Having discovered that neither side could attack the other ( or even defend itself ) without incurring self-destruction , both were concerned that no sudden moves or impulsive gestures , misunderstood by nervous opponents , should plunge them together into nuclear oblivion . The proposals were not to lay down weapons but rather to sheathe them . <P> Thus the U.S. object is to devise ways of preventing a big nuclear war or of containing lesser ones . Its proposals , in broad outline : <P> To forestall surprise attack , inspection of border areas from the air , of airports and missile bases by ground teams . To reduce the likelihood of brush-fire wars spreading into world conflagrations , some reductions in total manpower and armaments by the major powers ( e.g. , U.S. and Russia to 1,700,000 men apiece ) , plus inspections and bans on the import and export of arms , and checks on troop movements . European nations have worried lest the U.S. , by nuclear disarmament alone , might leave them defenseless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To discourage other powers from developing atomic bombs ( experts estimate that no less than 20 nations could develop their own bombs in the next ten years ) , the U.S. was urging that the three present nuclear powers accept a cutoff date when production of nuclear weapons will cease everywhere , and all nuclear materials will thereafter be diverted to peaceful purposes . <P> Last week Stassen methodically filled in the details of the U.S. plan in London , day by day . He proposed an immediate cut of U.S. and Russian forces to 2,500 , - ooo each ( an old figure that both sides have used at one time or another ) . A second-and third-stage cut bringing troop strength down to 1,700,000 could be left to the future and would depend on " political conditions . "
