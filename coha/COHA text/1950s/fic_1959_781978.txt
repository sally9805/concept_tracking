 | He had red hair grayed with blond , was sunburned salmon and tattooed with the flags of the world and glaucous mermaids . When Horatio knew him he was fifty and had just " quit " ( two t 's ) the navy yard after twenty-two years as a carpenter and steam fitter . In 1917 he had manned the guns , but he quit just when every other man was being pressed into service for the construction of a two-ocean navy . " ' T was so God-damned noisy a man could n't think . " His ears had been offended not by the booming of the guns and the pounding of boilers , but " All of a sudden  --  wheestles ! and Hep ! Hep ! Salute  --  " ( Two t 's . ) He screamed a whistle through his teeth . " T  - -  all that  --  " ( Two k 's . ) " They put this college youngster over m'head as an en-sign , " said Harry .

Rain or shine he descended to the rocks along the river , yet the image of him was always against the bluecaps and whitecaps , for it was only in fair weather that Horatio came there . With fastidious gusto he ate great Italian sandwiches of whole loaves crammed with vegetables and salami . Then he dove in and laved the dock . When one took leave of him , he never said , " Take it easy , " like most of the experts one would meet on the shore . Certainly he did not say , " Be good , " which in the circumstances was a remark of simple lunacy . But he said , " Be good to yourself now . " On the occasion that he was out of sorts he said in deep tones , " Do n't buther me , I 'm uggly ... . " Whud 'm I doing here on my ass ? " My father tried to bend me the right way by his example .

He was not the marrying kind , but several of his old woman friends , to whom he had been faithful through the years , picked their way over the rocks to enjoy with him the leaping sunbeams , When he was in the mood , he flew the Stars and Stripes . And under the rocks , working at night concealed from all eyes , he built a tidy den , extending the chimney of it into the disused drain . This hide-out had a solid door and a large padlock . Inside it had a bunk and a stove . Sometimes there rose unconsciously to his lips , in association with a persistent memory of a childhood refusal , and in a dialect thicket than that of his manhood , the remark , " ' D'ruther fish .

But there was a dismal probability that his money was spent and he had gone to work . Tattooed on his right and left were slender arm-length mermaids whose tail fins clasped his wrists . Spreading fanwise from his solar plexus to both shoulders were the colors of the nations of the world . And writhing on his belly head-downward was a winged and smoking dragon . It was to Harry Tyler 's den that Horatio now sped in the night . 3 . THE PIGEONS On the line of 189th Street , Horatio descended the slope from the chambers under the highway . The rain was bouncing on the highway and boiling in the river . He crossed the tracks that were not gleaming . He climbed the invisible wire fence . There was a gleam under the rock ; Harry was in his place just as he had figured it ! But now just as hesitation suddenly seizes on any uninvited guest and he wonders if he dares to knock after all , and his guilt is all the stronger because he has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly . There was no reply . " He is asleep . " He rapped sharper . As sharp as he dared . " Harry , " he whispered . " Harry Tyler ! " he whispered hoarsely . He could have called louder , for the rain was pattering over all the broad sea . He knocked . He kicked softly with his foot . " He wants to be left alone with whoever it is ; but Harry would n't keep me out in the rain . . . . Harry , " said Horatio and his voice choked , " it 's me , your friend Tony ! " Like a gulph , the terrible thought disclosed itself ( so soon does a momentary irritation project itself in murderous fancies ) : " They 've killed my beautiful friend Harry Tyler , and he died here shut up alone like a rat in the wall . " The door opened . Like lightning the silhouetted figure drove against his body a  --  bladeless knife . It was his brother Lothair . Was it his brother Lothair  --  so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolve unlined from his face ? " What have they done to my brother Lothair ? " he thought with the egoistic pity of boys , wounded by any alteration in the close family images which fill their experience , and they think that their family strains are debased . But the courage need not have drained from his heart because of the flame in Lothair 's eyes , which in fact other persons had noticed in his own .  | " Sit down , please , Lothair , " he said , pushing him onto the bunk . " I 'm glad to see you . " He closed the door and they were in the close candlelit room , warmed by the stove , and whose walls were rock and boards . He might have noticed that his brother was not so far gone from his wits but that he had made a fire . On the cot lay a rifle . " To the pigeons ! " said Lothair . " Belongs to the pigeons . I tell you . To the pigeons of the rocks . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a hundred stories high , pockmarked with convenient apertures . There is plenty of food . For the pigeons . " Somewhere in his flight , he had ripped off a telephone receiver and its wire . He held the receiver in one hand ; in the other he grasped that bladeless knife ( which , by the way , also had no handle ) . " You 've seen them take wing in hundreds ? " With his free hand , that held the bladeless knife without a handle , he began to make fluttering swooping motions from the floor in all directions to the ceiling . " They take wing ! Shine in the sunlight with the spaces among them . Halt ! In one instant they pause and turn as one bird . There is a flash of darkness . And now the sun is shining under the other wing . As flowing , almost as flowing , as the fire . " It was not unreasonable , what he was trying to say : that it is possible to look at our city as though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do they not flourish there , and go free and unregarding , as the air ? Absently he pressed the receiver to his ear and looped the wire round his neck , the end of it dangling . " Someone is coming , " he whispered . " Blow out . " Not to cross him , Horatio did so . In a few moments the footsteps of the guard passed outside and then faded like the first half of our century . " So . All New York was designed for the free living of the pigeons of the rocks , " he said with finality . " But what , now , about the cats ? Have you given a thought to the cats ? I am not thinking only of house cats , but of the striped tiger , burning bright  --  " " Go to sleep , Lothar , " said Horace , kneeling and pulling him down on the bunk . " There . Go to sleep now . Sleep . " The big fellow laid his hand on the rifle and fell asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in Harry Tyler 's flag , and so , wrapped darkly in the Stars and Stripes , curled up round the stove . The scratch above his heart ached very little . He was thankful for , and even pleased , with his new home in the rocks , cut off from Empire City , where the lordly river hardly flows .  | Chapter 9 ? THE SOCIAL COMPACT If a man be held in prison or bonds or is not trusted with the liberty of his body , he can not be understood to be bound by Covenant to subjection ; therefore he may , if he can , make his escape by any means whatsoever . - HOBBES 1 . How LOTHAIR STOOD BEHIND THE BARS When he was first locked behind the bars , where he could not persist in being of service ( whether we were willing or not ) , Lothair did not pace like the crazed tiger , nor stare dumbly through the opening , but he grasped with his hands the two end bars and stared at the middle bar . A sympathetic critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stubbornly wanted to serve in his own way . But this is a convenient lie , for one can not serve in one 's own way , but only in someone else 's need , to which one gives heart , head and hand . This makes it almost impossible to serve at all ( though one can try ) , because A 's need is not amenable to B 's heart , etc. ; nevertheless , Lothair persisted , not in trying to serve , but in actually serving , until he was jailed . Now of all the lovely outgoing acts of the soul , it is only service that can be frustrated by bars . For if you jail a lover , will not his love turn first to dreams , then strongly burn for invisible or perhaps divine loves ? And if you jail an artist , a thinker , they are still free , to dance with rage and count the bars . A moralist is freer still : he has himself to control . But a man of service can only grasp the bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , while the courage drains from his heart . 2 . How LOTHAIR TIRELESSLY COMMITTED HIMSELF ALL THE WAY Nettled , our sympathetic critic cries out : " I am suspicious of this man who will not show his face . Why does n't he serve himself ? ' If I am not for myself , who is for me ? ' Why does n't he be himself ?  | For in the end this is the only way to benefit mankind . But he offered me a hand  --  good ! I rejected it  --  too bad . Why did he pet sist in making a nuisance of himself ? " What is this word " rejected " ? The man wills to serve you . It is not up to you to accept or reject . You in fact have a society with its conditions . If he chose to serve according to your conditions , what could you do about it , except suffer the advantages ? Now there is another man who relies on himself and on nature , and he works , as you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in all likelihood he judges that you are quite demented anyway and he is unwilling to waste his strength in your conditions or baffle his wits on your wrong view of the problems . But how could you disregard Lothair ? He reserved judgment as to whether society was sane or mad ; lie took its existence as prima-facie proof of its possibility ; he tirelessly committed himself , at need , to every one of the conditions  --  to the very conditions that were creating the desperate need ( but he always thought he saw a way out ) . Then , in the end , there was Lothair , insistent on being of service  --  just when all the rest were breathing sighs of relief at the prospect of getting rid of it all , or of some of it , by rushing into destruction ; or of letting it just close in , and dying . Lothair refused to let the war solve the problems . At this moment it was necessary to jail him . 3 . How LOTHAIR AND ELIPHAZ WERE ADVERSARIES Lothair and Eliphaz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising that both of them execrated the violence of the world-wide total war . By multiplying his enterprises , Eliphaz succeeded in draining the good use from each thing in turn and giving it a value in zeros without an integer . With patient flexibility , Lothair countered him by demonstrating a social possibility nevertheless in each exchange , in each loss  --  like a tireless swordsman , always on the defense , intent on keeping us all alive , and waiting . ( Waiting for what ? ) But the hearts of the people were not so great as those of their champions ; they did not have an idea , and without an idea it is impossible to be endlessly patient . Soon therefore they degenerated into violence on each other . Violence is too quick ; it is too close ; it does not exhaust the soul . It is not objective . It does not nourish ( educare ) the tender strength of the animals into humanity . 4 . WHY IT IS DANGEROUS TO FRUSTRATE A MAN OF SERVICE But ah , when you frustrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , the effect is not what you hope for . He does  | not withdraw . On the contrary , he says to himself : " These persons need me more desperately than I conceived . I thought it was just a case of so and so , but in fact it is the much deeper need of such and such . " Then , in a short time , he comes to offer you a hand ? and to your terror it looks like a fist . He used to have a plan according to the conventions you were conscious of ; but now it seems almost to be  --  direct action . And what if the blow should surprise in you the knowledge that you did not know you knew ? Do you think , on his part , that it 's not a terrible thing for a man like him to have to change his theory ? 5 . THE SOCIAL CONTRACT One day Lothair pressed his forehead against the bar and groaned : " The social compact is abrogated that I used to have with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life he spoke of the people in the third person rather than in the first person , or in moments of towering anger or love in the second person . ) " I for my part fulfilled it to the letter , and I am a close reader ; but these ignoramuses have alienated themselves from communication . " The tears began to flow from his bland gray eyes when he thought : " It was not by any decision that I entered that compact , nor did I enter it so much as I was nourished by it into my growth . From the very beginning I learned how to warp the language and to aim at ordinary goods by indirection . But it was not asked , it was not agreed , that I take leave completely of my wits and honor . This we would see to step by step . I was willing to take my chances . " But this compact was for mutual life and service ; and when they threaten to take away my life and they deprive me of my liberty , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of nature . " What a hard saying ! I was not trained to live by force and fraud without a care , without the counsel and the resistance of my obstructive friends . What ! Am I supposed to learn the language anew and try , a late learner , to say simply what is the case ? And to aim directly at what it is I want ? I have not been like artists and the sages who from the beginning refused to associate with these people ( and maybe they were in the right after all ! ) ; now they can speak with ease and play even deadly games . But nothing occurs to me except to growl and bare my teeth . " Alas ! Those people ? " he now came to say those ? " have alienated themselves from the natural generation . They have lost patience . They have forgotten the continuous association between their hearts and the way they move about the streets . They take gambler 's chances . Their architects are crazy . Violent ! Violent !  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams , is it therefore I who am alienated from nature ? " As he said this the tears were scorched from his eyes , which began to flame . He ungrasped the bars and began to pace to and fro iii the cage . 6 . How LOTHAIR ENJOYED A GOOD SAMPLING OF THE CREATION Ten steps from one corner to another is already something . If I repeat them one hundred and fifty times I shall have walked one verst . ? KROPOTKIN , Memoirs of a Revolutionist It was lovely in the cell ( once one agreed to recognize it as a place in its own right ) ; it was an excellent example of the created space : transparent , and actually alight and bounded by color  --  a kind of brownish gray . Here four right angles exhausted a plane , and planes cut planes in neat lines . From place to place , motion was continuous , so one could stride from corner to corner without vanishing or necessarily stopping short , until the wall . If one interposed a hand with extended fingers before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The food ( such as it was ) was as it should be : unlike the human organism but potentially like it , so that it was transformed by digestion into Lothair . The air supported slow combustion in the lungs and would have allowed a match to burn if one had a match . The iron rang with its beautiful elasticity : the sound echoed and reechoed so fast that one could not analyze the clang but could only marvel . There were eighty-three wasps , some of them vainly crawling up the wall and slipping back . Lothair offered his services to them , lifting them to the sunny window . They did no harm , unless one annoyed them . He was pleased to consider himself a friend of the wasps . Suddenly he was stung , once , twice , in either hand . He restrained the impulse to lash back with reflex rage . Instead , he was sorely puzzled : how could one tell just what it was that annoyed a wasp ? This made it difficult to befriend them  --  according to their need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE NEW DIRECTIVE Having entered the state of Nature , Lothair now lived in the world without bars . The others were behind the bars . For bars , the  | bars that imprison , are in the soul ; those other things , the iron obstacles that restrict your movements , are just tough obstacles . As we say , no holds barred . Behind the bars was the corridor , and trebly behind bars , the office . It was only in a potential sense that there existed any other natural men and other lovely places , for Lothair was a bad prisoner , incommunicado . Inasmuch as he had been indisposed to co-operate with those people previously , why should they have expected him to co-operate now ? Lothair often failed to co-operate . Behind the bars was the office ! Suddenly there came to the office a new directive , direct from military headquarters . At last the conscription had been removed from civilian authority and given to the military . This resulted in a new policy of great moment to Lothair . The new policy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily as a means of organizing society . This meant a quite different standard of soldierly efficiency . The new directive was that Lothair and his friends were henceforth to be called " stinker cases . " They were by no means to be accepted or forced into the Army ; on the contrary , they were to be discarded , forgotten , their names lost in the files . If a man was not eager to be a soldier , if he had a second thought about it , if perhaps he had expressed his dubiety by cutting off his fingers , such a man was a " stinker case " ; he would not make a soldier . Previously , as we saw , if a man was absolutely unwilling , then the whole force of the state was brought to bear to weed him in . This cost a good deal for education , policing and psychiatry ; it was destructive of the esprit de corps . But now if a man did n't want to be a soldier , he did n't have to be a soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Furthermore there was a shortage of labor . 8 . How LOTHAIR CRIED OUT FOR VICTORY Lothair was brought to the office to hear the new directive . Craftily he observed that the window was open and had no bars . " Alger , " said the administrator , " you are a stinker case . " He looked about : there were two guards , but they were at ease , with their mouths open . " Out of you we shall never make a soldier . Why should we feed you here ? " A rifle was held in nerveless fingers . " On the other hand , if you work for your living  --  it makes no difference what you do , every job is in the cash nexus  --  then you will contribute to the victory . "  | He counted out the steps and blows : one , two and three . " We used to draw the line on the kind of service acceptable . Now we have gotten wiser . " A tulip tree brushed against the wall . Though Lothair had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subhuman agility . " Today , " said the administrator , " is the fifteenth of the month . " Great God of Cats ! Make this leap sure and Lothair will liberate the tigers on 63rd Street . " On the thirtieth you will be a free man . Ha ! " And he offered his hand . " Hey ? " said Lothair , hearing for the first time and staring unbelieving at the hand . " I said Ha ! And I offered my hand . Ha ! " Lothair seized the desk with his paws and in a voice hoarse and gasping , a bellow and a scream , he said : " I am tired of fighting a drawn-out losing fight . Now I am longing for Victory . With joy . I want to fight with joy . Great God of Cats , make this leap sure ! Where is the joy to be found again of my fifth and sixth years , before I began to be of service to these people ? Be free ! Be free , tigers on Sixty-third Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with these people . " He broke the desk in two and held a part in each paw . In fright the administrator seized the phone to ask for orders in this unusual case , of a stinker who was psychotic even before they inducted him into the Army . Lothair tore the instrument from his hand and altogether from the wall . " How dare you try to communicate after you have alienated your-selves ? " He took the guard 's rifle and clubbed him on the head , and on the third count he leaped through the window . There was a belated shot . There was a Chase . There was a Flight and a Chase . The condition of a chase is that while A moves from L to M , B moves from M to N. 9 . IN THE SCROLL OF THE CORNICE He had made his getaway , and had gotten to New York . He spent the afternoon curled up in the giant scroll of a verdigris cornice , at the tiptop corner of a building , one hundred feet above the avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with distended plumes . They implanted their claws on his back and his head , and sat for an hour . Others sat in an innumerable series on the ledge  | above his head , and serially took wing in a swirling spiral to the street . In their close course , the cars below were like the crests of the billows . The pigeons beat in mid-air like a cloud . The soldiers were hunting in three dimensions through the houses . To Beat the Bush is for A to go to L , M , N , and 0 in the hope that B is at L or M or N or O. To Beat About the Bush is for A to go to L , M , N , and 0 in the knowledge that B is at K. But a Wild-Goose Chase is for A to go to L , to M , to N , to 0 when B is not at the end of this series of places . A rainspout was trickling within reach , and Lothair took the occasion to wash his socks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verdigris . Very convenient . Looking about he saw that there was a square platform where it would be possible to install a kerosene stove ... . ( I am almost not joking . One can not imagine the courage with which people take root in what places , and make them habitable and decorate the place . Every place has its peculiar advantages . ) Next moment , with his heart in his mouth he slid five thunderous yards down the slope and hung on with his claws . This was not perhaps a domestic note . A Close Thing is for A to come to L when B is leaving L. Nip and Tuck is for A to come to M , N , 0 , when B is leaving M , N , O. 10 . IN FULL FLIGHT Later in the day , they started out again . As the mist thickened and the evening came on and the Chase sped along the river  --  for Flight and Chase , however scattered , move as one heedless entity  --  then each of the soldiers and Lothair himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were being fused into one by this fatiguing and hypnotic Flight ( for to a candid observer , looking at their drawn faces , it would have seemed that they were all in full flight ) . There were shots , but they could not hit him . Now Lothair , beside himself with violent joy , stood behind a tree and blew out the brains of the first boy who loomed on the path . " Is this direct action ? " he asked himself bitterly . " And is this mortal blow , given or received , precisely the immortal blow for which I am longing ? " He broke into the woods in full flight .  | The comrades of the boy wept with indignation as they carried away the body . Nevertheless , they were one and all in full flight together , cast under a spell by the rhythm of their limbs and the serial order of the places through which they passed , in the close mist  --  when suddenly the shock of death , which is too vast for the heart to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single thing after all , released the deep feelings common to one and all . The meaning of this common feeling was as if each one  --  but in reality it was one feeling of them all  --  as if each one stopped in his tracks and asked himself : " What am I doing here ? What am I doing here so far from home ? " This was the meaning of the arrested motion in the full flight , that could be seen in the drawn faces expressing indignation and violent joy , while their limbs sped in rhythm through the series of the places , in the close mist . The storm broke and the night fell . There was a volley of shots on the line of 189th Street , and Lothair vanished into his hole . Next moment a splash could be heard in the river ; the soldiers fired ; and now they were pursuing Horatio . 11 . ADDIO When Lothair awoke , the confusion of the misty night had dissipated from his mind , as had the gentle modifications of fatigue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest and clarity his restricted mind was fixed on the one stark insane resolve to open the cages of the zoological garden and let free the beasts . This seemed to him feasible , useful and called for . The place in the rocks he regarded as his den . His mind was invaded by agonizingly sharp and joyous odors , which in fact existed there , though he had not yet learned to distinguish one from another . He did not think of himself as an animal so much as a kind of panic being ; not a proper member of the animal generation , which is always a goat or a bear , but as the Friend of Wasps , the Planner for the Pigeons , and the Liberator of large Cats . The inhibition of his olfactories was loosed , that had set in when he so early became cleanly ( not helped either by clouds of tobacco , which in jail he had not tasted ) . The powerful actuality of this fresh sense gave him a different awareness of participation in the environment than one had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment into an orderly sequence of argument , immediately a nausea and disgust of the smells  | overpowered him . But now he repressed the thoughts instead of the smells , which in fact were vital to him . ( Any train of argument led to an impasse in any case . ) He roughly nudged Horatio awake . " Get up . Go to the zoo and get the keys . " Started awake , the boy stared up at him in human fright . What he saw was not Lothair , but a shadowy figure of dream who had drawn up a chair by his bedside and sat down . It was a woman , but gracelessly dressed in a gray sharkskin suit and skirt with coarse peach stockings . He could see only the lower part of the figure . He was afraid . She was perhaps his mother whom he did not remember . She was like the notorious Miss Estey , the disciplinary principal who tyrannized over that school of imprisonment and torture from which he had cunningly escaped by tearing up the records . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me the keys , Lothar , " he said in a thin voice . The figure rose in wrath . She was wielding , in a paroxysm of stupidity , a knife  --  and vanished . " Get up , damn you ! " said Lothair , bellowing and screaming . It was only a bladeless knife , without a handle , and Horatio , who was not used to be addressed in this fashion , recovered his happy wits . " Hell to you , " he said cheerfully . He had no intention of conforming to insane plans . Lothair was choking with nausea at the sweetish smell , the rank and sour flowers , of the human being . " Look , Lothar , " said Horace , who soon had the violent smell of powerful coffee flooding from the stove ( for at Harry Tyler 's was nothing but the blackest ) , " it is not impossible to let the animals out . I know . This idea is a little crazy  --  excuse me if I talk to you like a brother  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then what ? A few people will get hurt and then they 'll soon hunt the beasts down , into corners , eh ? They 'll haul them back into their cages and station extra guards . And that 'll be the end o ' that . Be reasonable , boy . " His brother was not listening at all , but was respiring with intense excitement . " I am going to lead by my hand the tiger burning bright , and the grinning crocodile and the giraffe , to visit the sociological museum , and to see how it is that those people exist . " His thought was that the city was a vast sociological museum kept for the edification of sane animals . Horatio shook the big fellow by the shoulders . " Snap out of it , boy . "  | Lothar looked at him with mild gray eyes . " Do you think it 's not wicked , " he said softly , " that little children are brought so early to see the lovely animals in cages ? Wo n't they dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Wo n't they think twice and also have thoughts even before the first thoughts ? Is this educational ? Is it moral ? " They were like Otello and Iago in the opera who swear , while the trumpets vibrate , Addio .

" 12 . NOBLESSE OBLIGE The invaluable happiness of liberty consists , not in doing what one pleases , but in being able , without hindrance or restraint , to do in the direct way what one regards as right and just . - GOETHE The curator of the zoo was Mynheer . When Horatio , who had had no intention of conforming himself to an insane plan , came into the curator 's office , he was very thoughtful . He sat and looked thoughtfully at his brother-in-law for a long time .

Have you made a social compact with these people ? This I find hard to believe , because you 're always too far ahead of the game . " " Why am I serving them ? ' these lunatics ' ?

ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF HARRY TYLER 'S PLACE Harry Tyler 's place was now the strictly private address of the brothers Alger . It had certain domestic advantages . It was the only home in all of the Empire City where one could beach and bathe out of the front door , except that at present they dared not venture forth . There were no neighbors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or philosophic persons , or persons haunted . Persons haunted , and they saw shapes in the rocks that were not there , or they failed to see shapes among the rocks that were there . The view was without a peer in Europe or the East . It was a location worth taking root in , and decorating the place , and , as Harry used , putting out a flag . Just now the great disadvantage was the approach , the entrance and the exit . One had to crawl , flatten himself against a rock , hide where the rats were . Occasionally a shot rang out and this was not a domestic note .  | Chapter 10 THE MORAL EQUIVALENT OF WAR It is a winter night .

All this one could understand , by means of acoustics and ballistics and a little artificial geology . All along the thundering front the general order was At Ease ( it was not so simple to be quite at ease ) . The friends of Arthur were gathered in their crater to debate and to invent the practical equivalent of the destructive rage of the war . One would see . Over the blasted crater , scorched by a heat more ancient than the bombs , there flew an invisible flag of truce , for who would fire at these internationalists ? It was the one-time Society for the Propagation of Vice , S.P.V. ? S.V.P. , if you please , the men who had planned by pleasure to set the teeth on edge , to make the teeth chatter that were solidly clamped on us  | all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would crack teeth . But what if all were terribly well pleased , and still they fought the war ? One would see  - -  But now on their flapping flag was the device , NEED . One would see whether it was possible to harness such a deadly lust ( whose only aim seemed to be to destroy us ) , to lead us forth , or at least not to destroy us . The long boom , that sounded very distant in this commons of need , was hushed in many whispers . Many writers have considered the problem of the moral equivalent of war ( what I should rather call the practical equivalent of war ) : 1 . At first one might have supposed that the war was a conflict among the satisfactory aims of peace , and one could solve the conflict . 2 . One might have supposed that , apart from conflict , there was a superfluity of power and passion , and that it was not enough to have peace without conflict , but one must wage the peace . 3 . One might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive passions , but it was possible to channelize the aggression into a dynamic peace , even if the passion was destructive , for there are many things that need destroying . 4 . Then one might have supposed that many persons were selfaggressive , or even all of us from time to time . Good ! Let us put ourselves in jeopardy , but why need we disturb the general peace ? No , no ! What if the need was for all , en masse , to release one another from the bondage of peace in order to put us all together in jeopardy ? One would see whether it was possible to do so without being at war . 1 . ARTHUR Finally Arthur came . What ! Was it Arthur ? The bomb must have burst in his face for the shrapnel to have torn such deep scars . Only a few of the scars were the wounds of iron ; most of them , the crosses and the claws on the brow and about the eyes and mouth , were the scars of care . IIe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he could not remember when he had been at peace . He looked large , not as we remember him from before . The others , even his friends , were still cowering , but Arthur was at last undisturbed , and he stood above them a head taller . Yet just when he rose to speak there was such a hideous racket , of bursts of a ! a ! a ! that he was momentarily disturbed . Several of  | the others shut their eyes tight and clenched their fists ; it was not long before they would be out of their wits . But Arthur wryly smiled on one side of his face , and the gracious dimple on that side sank to the bone . He said , " At ease , " and they were at ease . " We , " he said , " who have relied on disasters of the war to minimize our misery , are now the only parliamentary body left in the world . Formerly , all sorts and conditions proceeded down their slopes by persuasion ; they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other , for the next step . ( We helped each one down his own slope . ) But now their minds are stunned by violence ; and if they happen by chance to gather in a group , it is not to exchange reasons , but  --  as they suggest it to one another  --  one unreasoning idea overwhelms them all ( not necessarily untrue ) . We , however , are used to this violence ; we are used to finding reasons ; we are used to finding reasons in this violence . Who of us did not do and suffer violence long ago , when the others imagined they were at peace ? And after a while a man thinks up some reason or other . " If we happen to be with the others in a group and there is a violent blow , then we also are shaken  --  but we are not stunned . There rises in us the very same overwhelming idea as in them , but it is not unreasoning ( and not necessarily untrue ) . It makes a difference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can devise a plan , eh ? " The idea is to rush into jeopardy en masse . Why en masse ? In order to be joyous and guiltless before our greater selves , because the greater part of each man 's self is his social self ; therefore , we suggest it to one another and we are not ashamed . Why into jeopardy ? In order to come close to the place where the tide of original power is dragging at the self small and great ; and will it not succumb ? But the self wants to die as long and as intensely as it can . " Can our friends devise a plan for this idea ? Can we civilize this lust and make it part of our culture ? I see , " he said , consulting his notes , " that we have appointed four committees : Committee on Land , on Sea and in the Air ; Committee on Fun and Games ; Committee on Blows Given and Received ; Committee on the Children . " Will the gentlemen chairmen of these committees please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A PHYSICIST In the wind of the bombardment , the chairman of the Committee on Land and Sea , etc. , wiped his eyeglasses imperturbably . He was ( again ) that physicist who invented the cyclotron that he was afraid  | to set in motion because it might initiate the disintegration of all the atoms in the universe , but , curiosity getting the better of him , he set it going anyway . After that moment , he was no longer disturbed by noises . He was not a psychologist , and his proposal was simple-minded : to organize with large teams the dangerous solitary sports of peace , ski jumping , mountain climbing , automobile racing for records , and the descent into volcanoes ; channel swimming ; stratospheric flights and parachute jumps . To be sure , in socializing such individual deeds of daring  --  so that the players would be not one or a few but whole crowds at a time  --  it would be necessary to employ elaborate equipment and even to modify the nature of the jeopardy . Thus , to organize a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embark the swimmers in a large ship on the high seas , and then sink the ship . To play " Descent into the Volcano , " it would perhaps be most convenient to simulate the conditions altogether : to spray a field with fire and have the crowd run an obstacle race across it . He proposed also a sport called " The Town Braves the Lightning , " in which an entire population was subjected to artificial thunderbolts and froze fast or ran for shelter whichever way the panic seized it . Last , he offered for consideration a kind of pentathlon of these obstacle races , arduous swims and panic leaps through space . Such were the peaceable panic sports on Land , on Sea and in the Air . 3 . A PSYCHOLOGIST The committees had worked in collaboration , and their proposals dovetailed into each other to make one immense Festival . The next chairman But as he rose to speak there was such a hideous racket that a man , as they say , could not hear himself think . He could not hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented a new sound called Breaking the Sound Barrier , and that was a remarkable noise ; nevertheless , nevertheless , it was  --  still  --  possible  --  by forcing  --  to think . This was an accomplished speaker and , to put his audience into a better mood , he began with a little joke about the Marine discharged . " It seems that this Marine , whose name was Little Audrey , was discharged and returned to his home town . But since he was no longer in service , he was again eligible for conscription , and after a while his name came up and he was notified to report for induction . But when he received the notification , Little Audrey just laughed and laughed . . Vhy did Little Audrey laugh and laugh ?  | Because he had been blinded at Guadalcanal and he could n't serve anyway . " The joke was met with a muffled silence . He then went on to explain that the proposal of the previous speaker was not sufficiently psychological . The outline was good , but it was necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily the case that trying conditions would lead to panic fright , for people have wonderful powers of endurance . These surprises were the familiar fun and games : the cigar that explodes in the teeth , the doorknob with the electric shock , the pie concealing the adder , the whore with the razor to castrate , the mine outside the home port , the sniper camouflaged as a lilac bush , the birthday telegram that proves to be a message of death . These were the fun and games that set the nerves on edge , when the soul is open in the expectation of pleasure . Then , he opined , was the time to play " The Village Braves the Lightning . " " The sniper , " he said , " hsub calil a si ohw , and the ; sg aall uI aoni alp aiogM . " For some of his words came backwards and some quite upside down . 4 . A SOCIOLOGIST " Very good ! " cried the next speaker . " But you are overlooking the sociology . The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single team , they will normalize one another out of their surprise . They nerve themselves before one another , and little private agitations are moderated by the esprit de corps . But now let us split the single team into two competing teams , and quite the opposite is the result ! For now each stroke of fun is attributed to the unknown intentions of the other side ; the surprise proves the weakness of one 's own side . The solidarity cracks . This accumulates ... . But more important still is the fact that competition pushes to the extreme , indefinitely far beyond what one originally intended . " And , borrowing a text from Clausewitz , he showed that whereas in the beginning each man intends to play within a certain limitation ( as a dog snaps his jaws but will not pierce the skin ) ; and all of the friends agree on the limitation as a rule and an inner check ; nevertheless , the intention of the other side is always partly unknown : they , too , have a limitation , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to counter the surprise . A blow falls  --  how could it have been altogether foreseen ? And how hard will the next blow fall ? This makes the retaliation a little stronger than was intended , perhaps even a little beyond the rule ! How soon they have driven each other into the extreme ! Further than one hoped ... .  | The next question is whether those others are still not too exhausted to parry this next blow of ours , which is , we are afraid , the last that we have strength for . " Closest of all , " he said , " is to fight a drawn-out losing fight . " As he said it , suddenly the tears gushed from his eyes , and he stood there , to their embarrassment , sobbing and choking . 5 . A THEOLOGIAN " I know you all  --  " The fourth chairman was a theologian , and as he spoke it seemed to grow darker . " I know you all , " he said . " Surprising the open soul  --  and inspiring one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : is it by material means like these that you hope to lull , in peace , the lust for death ? How little you conceive the strong humanity of the people ! By such means as these you will lead them to acts of heroism , and no peace during it or afterward ( for it has not yet been shown that heroism is the same as peace ) . I do not here see the shadow of the First Angel , who makes out of being nonbeing . " Therefore , let me urge on you , in your games , to imitate the little children . For only boys and girls have hellish thoughts . " There are moments when the childish ego exists in its pride so pure , without the assuaging of any vice , that he can blast his brother out of existence and empty out the space . " The little girls and boys have hellish thoughts ; therefore , listen to their conversation . It is woven of malevolence and guiltiness . A little boy I know thinks such a thought , thrillingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Abyss himself voids the passions and the sunny light on the rocks along the river where they 're swimming . But it 's only a forgetful child prattling , and the world comes back into existence . " The comes into , " he said , for every other of his words vanished . 6 . How THEY ALL LAUGHED , EXCEPT ARTHUR Now , when the four committeemen had reported  --  physicist , psychologist , sociologist and theologian  --  it was time to combine and evaluate their proposals , to see if indeed they added up to a peaceable equivalent of the war . Therefore , Arthur stood up again , thanked them for their earnest work , praised their collaboration and proceeded to summarize the discussion :  | 1 . Fundamentally there was to be a pentathlon of dangerous social games . 2 . These were to occur by surprise in the moments of expected ease . 3 . By competition these games would be driven to extremes beyond the rules . 4 . And all of this to be like Hell , by imitating the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a pause . They burst out laughing . For indeed , when it was all added up , they found that their peaceable equivalent for the war turned out to be precisely  --  the war . They laughed boisterously . It was pitch night , and nothing could be seen but their white teeth around the ring . Their laughter shook the night , but no one would fire at these internationalists . Instead , their infectious laughter was taken up sporadically along the lines . But Arthur peacefully smiled in the lone darkness , because he knew that his friends had not failed but had  --  precisely  --  succeeded . He was alarmed only by the possibility that the laughter might be the effect of shell shock . But it was the solid laughter of comedy , that greets the moment when the great expectation comes to precisely nothing . He stood there very large in the dark ( if one could see him ) and waited for the laughter to subside . " Now , my children , " he began , and they were quiet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the laughing song itself , as it is sung by the bells of Papageno : " We have dreamed out this game . Shall we not then now have peace ? We have analyzed out the parts to their origins and we have put them together to make the whole thing ; and you see it is nothing more than this . "  | Chapter 11 LAURA 'S PLAN FOR NO PLACE Souvenirs d'horizons , qu'est-ce , 8 toi , que la Terre ? - MALLARME Laura , however , continued to serve our society on its own terms , and slowly drained the courage from her heart . The present day , from which she drew her impressions , was still what she had to give back , with sense and style . Its colors were not gay now ; the work was joyless . She succeeded in enlivening it with alcohol ; able , by becoming drunker , to design more accurately . She was planning a town for our community at war . The first condition , to avoid the bombing , was the dislocation of industry into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiently for the transportation of heavy loads in the most out-of-the-way places ? Before addressing such a problem , it was useful to pour a drink . Working with her secret smile , she did not realize that her attitude toward her two handy boys , her best helpers , had become habitual exasperation . They quarreled with each other , blaming each other for slips ? which were all the while aimed at their mother , who did not seem to love them . It was hopeless to try to control Lefty , the slenderer of the twins . ( They were not identical . ) At his best he worked by a kind of intuition , as if he were doodling . And now if , by a kind of doodle , he steered the tractor into a telegraph pole , at what point could one begin to correct him ? He was gentle ; there was no aggression in his sweet smile . It was unaware of what he was doing that he hacked the drawing board with an ax . Droyt was burly and no fool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could handle a ruler . He was open and pleasant , although not a genius for amiability like his brother . Now suddenly he was afflicted with absolute stupidity ; there was no use screaming at him , because he would not learn , but in the middle of the scene he went away in a rage . Then you might find him playing with himself . The two boys began to hammer each other . They flailed away ;  | soon they were bleeding . Then , looking at each other , they became sad and clung hand in hand . As if they were one person 's hands , holding hands with herself for security and a little comfort  --  after the tenth drink . They were longing for Mynheer , their father , to direct them with a quiet word , but he would n't come home . The architect had to arrange for the movement of the troops . Problem : how to transport many millions as swiftly and safely as possible to the place of the worst danger ? There had been little truth or honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one might rely on the roadside names of places and the directions at the forks of the roads . If the sign read THIS IS CLOSTER DEMAREST 2 MI. then one in fact knew where he was and whither he was bound . Many acts of reality , of truth and convenience , followed from this geographical knowledge . It was hard to be altogether lost . But because it was necessary to deceive the enemy , the signs of place and time now declared what was not the case . Every clock was wrong . Better yet was for all the vast land to brood in anonymity . Best of all would be for it not to exist . But to address this problem , it was useful first to pour a drink . The dense-packed train was to fly across a stable bridge and empty itself within range of the cannon . Suppose the enemy bombed the bridge in front of the flying train , would not the end be achieved the sooner ? No ; it would be a surprise ; stupid . Manfully Droyt came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his fingers . But when he clenched his hand nervously , he could not open it again and he forgot what he had to say . All he could show her was , dumbly , this fist . Problem : to adapt the community plan to the climate of the Acts of God and man . She studied the probabilities in the recent statistics . During the last decades there were fewer cyclones , but hurricanes were on the increase and were a good bet against the insurance companies . In tidal waves and earthquakes there had been such a boom that the mortality from them was greater than that of the war during its first years ; but the war had recovered its advantage . When she had taken account of all these necessary factors , and of the bombardment  --  such freedom of orientation as still remained she devoted to a pleasant southern exposure for the caverns . For at last , after one hundred thousand years , it was possible to give a definitive answer to the essential community problem of  | manunkind , of " this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to live in trees or caves ? ( " Pity this busy monster manunkind not . " ) In caves ! In caves ! Safe from the prying of the Sky . Such were the community problems to which Laura Alger , the imperial pensioner and the stylist of the Empire  --  the wife of Colijn Duyvendak , the lady Van der Meer  --  came in the thirty-fifth year of her life , with the nerve ends fainting with exasperation and all the courage drained from her heart . ( But pity this busy monster mankind . ) THIS IS NO PLACE THE TIME IS NOT NOW IF YOU CONTINUE ON THIS ROAD YOU WO N'T GET ANYWHERE IiED So it was possible , given the resources of the habitable globe , to tear up the roots , to undecorate the place and make it not a home . ( As I myself used to have a small home , rich with the art and thought of three thousand years , so that I knew my compatriots from of old and it made no difference to me that I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with works of art and thought in process , so that we were sure that we were the citizenry also of the future ; rich with fatherhood and motherhood ; rich with the trusting gatherings of friends , who spoke out their true thoughts ; this rich home was undecorated by our lapse of trust , faith and consideration ; became cold with wrath , degenerated into violence . Was this a home ? Good ! Let it not be a home if it is not a home , but then wander , live " as if in tents , " do not remain and continue to serve with no courage but plenty of wrath , and soon becoming noncommittal . And so we lost our home . ) The handy boys now did nothing but shirk , loaf , avoid , disappear from sight , be out of calling , forget their tools and be preoccupied with their fingernails . They were willing to take the gaff for any kind of lapse rather than work without their hearts in it . Often you might find them in their rooms playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duet , " Choo-choo train , " with a drawn-out warbling of train whistles , in which there is an infinite space .  | Finally , " Let 's evacuate , " said Lefty to his brother . And they ran away . The boys were keen hunters . If a fox that they were pursuing darted down the chimney of a closed-up house , they smashed the window and climbed in and shot him in the drawing room , leaving behind the empty cartridge shells as a mystery to the returning proprietor whose home had been burglarized but not robbed . 1 . THE ARTIST IN THE SHELTER Hitler has , without meaning it , been a great friend to Britain in more than one way . Among other benefits he has conferred upon us , he has compelled us as a people to take adult education seriously . Munich was the first important stimulus he applied . As a result of that famous  --  or infamous  --  episode many thousands of English men and women who previously had never dreamed of subjecting themselves to any educational process became at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn about war gases and how to combat them , about first aid and home nursing , about fire fighting and the duties of a civilian in the case of invasion or an air raid . ? H. C. DENT , Education in Transition So long as the rates of progress held good , these bombs would double in force and number every ten years . ? The Education of Henry Adams During the bombardment , the people huddled in the underground shelter that was their new-type home in the community . They had just lost their houses , their furnishings and their dear habits . And still the muffled explosions could be heard through the thicknesses of concrete . Many were softly weeping . Others were apathetic and seemed stunned . Others , partly by way of busily suppressing anxiety , grief , mourning ( but these would soon wail the loudest ) , were already making domestic arrangements , pre-empting the corners to sleep in , where one could not be surprised from the rear , and collecting soft newspapers like the Evening Sun . A wan light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was defective . Now an artist came , by motorcycle , so hurrying from shelter to shelter , to revive the spirits of the people . But what song could now avail , accompanied by the picking of the guitar ? He told first of the fires and the firemen . The fires were merrily blazing , and the firemen , in full sight of the sky , were urinating on the fires .  | By this forepleasure , of simple wit , he soon had them clapping to his rhythm and joining in the refrain , The fire says Hiss when the firemen piss . There were bursts of loud laughter ; the light brightened as the central power was restored ; and there began to be an atmosphere of radiant joy . Surely there was some deep release that gave the meaning to this panic enthusiasm that was not the effect of childish jokes . At the right moment the singer boldly went on to his true theme : to declare , to formalize and to fix the meaning of their joy , that they could securely live on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that we are rid of all that junk , houses and home furnishings and dear habits ! At one blow ! Who could have hoped for it ? " They were not laughing now , but their satisfaction expressed itself in deep , even breathing , while the sparks and wiry cries of the guitar were struck off by his pick of flint . What a release from compulsion , from responsibility and regularity , as they let loose that shit once and for all . It was a strong song that the popular entertainer sang ; but it was to an audience close to despair . At last the nurses came with tea and sandwiches , and the artist discreetly withdrew and mounted his motorcycle to hasten to the next place . 2 . The boys were gone ; but Laura , although she saw the evidences of it , did not notice it . Instead , drink by drink she was reliving the incidents of her separation from Mynheer . " Ugh , he wo n't take more than the third drink . One  --  two  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clam . You know the type ? A clam ? Clam ! Can you get the spirit of the party ? . . . But  --  is it so gay here , doctor ? " she wanted to know . The Reverend Dr. Bercovici did not show the effects of alcohol . But it was that by long use of being continually drunk he had built up a secondary behavior that looked like the habits of the world . " In tents ! " he thundered . " The Lord said live in tents . Why are they complaining ? What are you wailing about ? Did you expect your little house to last forever ? " It was hard to tell whether he spoke the words of God or the Devil . He seemed to welcome the bombardment . " Now he says I have no memory , " said Lama , " says I do n't keep my word . But I do have a memory . I have a l0000ng mem'ry .

I 'll sing the absence of the poet . Yes , yes , the absence of the poet . I love this Mallarme . Do you know this Mallarme . What he thought ? He thought that the immortality of something was its nonbeing after it was not !

Not the words he did say , but the words he did n't say ! Vast gulph in the midst ! " " My handy boys have left me , " said Laura . She stared in stupefaction at the absence of her hands .

The memories of horizons say that they do not know . Et toi , Mme. Duyvendak ? " " I am not alienated from my people , " said Laura , the architect turned camoufleur , " but we are alienated from our natures . My husband is right  --  we are alienated from our memory . I am alienated from my two hands . We are longing for a peace that we intend rapidly to destroy . " 3 .

We all are Adam 's children still . ? quoted by GOETHE 1 . The zoo was a pleasant square , surrounded on three sides by the cages of the beasts , the yellow wolves frenziedly pacing , the aloof giraffes , the crazed cats . Busy people were content to pause here awhile and enter into conversations without being introduced to one another . The pool of live water where the sea lions swiftly swerved from bumping their snouts was asymmetrically central , and into it the people gazed in absorption , or , staring , made jokes . And round the inner square the architect had thrown a raised terrace which was still in the square , so that being still in the pleasant square one could also gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest ? live water and spectators and pacing beasts  --  that could occupy yet hardly dominate attention , ever the same and endlessly changing , why should not people pause here and eventually be at their ease ? The abominable roar of the ( caged ) lion seemed to have an infinite hollow sounding board in which it became muffled and lost . It was a cunningly laid-out plaza that seemed to have no entrances or exits ( for one came in round the cages ) , so that the people rested in a limitless moment . On the fourth side , on the raised terrace , were tables and eating . Lothair was having his lunch there , waiting for the salvo of noon . Emilia and her boy were down below , observing and discussing the tiger burning bright . With thin lips , Horace was watching the people watching . I myself was all eyes for the bear on his ( barred ) hillside . And Harry Tyler  --   | People moved , singly or in groups , in all six directions . Others were content to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were vibrating in their restricted places . Sometimes , as if new created or vanishing away , people slipped sideways through the invisible exits . Withdrawing , upward and away from the pleasant plaza ( reversing the bomber 's angle ) , at a distance of a few hundred feet one no longer felt that he was in that square , although it still looked like a square of people . At this distance , of this size , the people were like the dolls of childhood  --  dear , close , lost ! Withdrawing ! With-drawing ! Depriving one 's self still farther of the plaza of our people  --  would not the possible return be in the form of a blow ? ( Reversing the ballistic parabola ) , at a distance of several thousand feet one could no longer distinguish that that speck in the vast ugly fly heap was a pleasant square of people in our beautiful Empire City . Here , where the bomb rode at rest under the plane , the bombardier in the deafening silence was not at his ease in any plaza endlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instruments were vibrating in their cages . The bombardier is lonely , yet he is not conscious of the absence of the people . ( Is it not something immortal , the absence of the people ? ) He is intensely concerned with what he is about . From the height of an airplane it is impossible to see the plan of a city square ; by the plan I mean the life . A good architect does not take account of such aerial views . Even from a motorcar one can see only landscape and enjoy the pleasures only of banked highways . It is necessary to go on foot to be content to pause awhile and to enter into conversations without introductions . From the height of an airplane only the Rocky Mountains or the ocean can make an impression . ( These one does not destroy with bombs . ) The bomb is at rest in the undercarriage  --  in a region of ticking machines and the immortal absence of the people . Now , supposing that ( at the bomber 's angle ) this bomb were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a few hundred feet would not the pleasant square begin to loom , peopled , clear , close , lost ? No longer depriving one 's self ! But what a thing it is to be returning in the form of a blow ! Here is the square , the environment of society ! and one is again a part of it .  | 2 . With noisy relish Lothair was addressing himself to two pork chops on his dish and meanwhile chattering away to himself . But , no , he was talking not to himself but to the two chops . He cut off a good bite and chewed it and exclaimed : " First rate ! Really , the food here 's first rate . Do n't you find it so ? Big portions , too . This is the first real meal , you know , I 've had in four years . Go ahead , take some more o ' the Burgundy . Oof , was n't it a close call this morning when I sneaked out ? Shh , not so loud .

Plenty of people seem to know about this place already . Nobody tells me anything . " He savagely gnawed the bone . " Well , old chop , that puts you in your place . Very good , too .

Her tongue clicked regularly against her bottom fangs when she inhaled to open wide her throat for the great drafts of oxygen to support the furious combustion of her soul . " Before he had a uniform , mummee , before he had a uniform how can they tell my father was a sergeant soldier ? My father 's dead  | now , but he 'll come back after the war 's over , is n't that right , mummee ? Thing is , when they all go back on the ships an ' then the war 's over . Some o ' the ships get sinked . My father an ' I think it 's mean to keep the animals in the zoo , do n't we , mummee ? . . . Mummee ! He 's getting up ! He ca n't come out , can he , mummee ? " When this crazed tigress went to and fro in her restricted space , she pulled herself by the forelegs but hardly moved her hind legs at all  --  they seemed almost as if atrophied . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God can make my daddy alive , ca n't he ? Why ca n't God put people together again if they have been killed and send them down from heaven ? I know why , because he has n't got the things together , all the stuff . After the war God will have everything again . We have to wait until after the war , then God can put people together again . " Harry Tyler , who was one of those waiting for the salvo of twelve , kept scowling upward at the planes . " Oh , shut your friggin ' trap , who cares ? " Look at that babe there , " he said , " bustin ' up her gocart happy as a friggin ' lark . Go teach her not to bust it when everywhere she looks there 's holes i ' the walls . " The lioness kept sending forth her infinitely hollow roar . " Oh , Jesus , hush up , miss , " said Harry , " or I 'll cram my cock down y'r throat . " The woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked away . Harry liked to watch the blond seal silently swerving from wall to wall . Another man was gaping at the giraffe and craning his own skinny neck , popping the Adam 's apple . He earnestly stuck his thumbs through his hair for horns . Everywhere there was an affinity , deep or ridiculously apparent , between the persons who were so earnestly staring and the totems that they were staring at . I knew a little red-haired lady , quick as a fox , who used to watch for hours in front of the quick fox . But why do I , who do not look anything like the brown bear ( at least so I think ) , stand by preference here , watching the bear on his rock ? It is because I like to hug tight . Stretching his little arms over the railing , Augie was chanting , " Tiger , Tiger " and " My Father and I. " When his mother saw that he was becoming overexcited and tried to draw him away , he sharply rejected her and rhythmically screamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quoted from Bertie in Anna Freud 's Infants Without Families .  | when the cat stepped to the right and a scream when she stepped to the left . Emily said firmly , " Come , " and seized his hand . He sank his teeth in her hand and , when she cried out , he tore himself free and with great deliberateness persistently knocked his head against the railing . With tight lips Horace watched them one and all from the terrace and said nothing . He wore a mixed expression . The expressions on the faces are simple or mixed . They are simple when there is one feeling ( or compatible feelings ) and this is a specification of the habitual character , as the choleric man will scowl and bare his teeth , and the lines that are already there merely deepen . In the conditions of society it is rare to see a simple expression ; and it is rarely in a work describing society that the writer can accurately declare that his personage wears a simple expression , suffering an original instinctual feeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when there is a conflict of feelings or when the feeling supervenes on a face already marked by a contrary habit . Wry , sly , quizzical , rueful , lewd , smirking , vacant , haughty : these are expressions rather elaborately mixed . Most often the expressions seen in society are the supervention of a kind of lust , eagerness or curiosity upon timidity ; or inattention upon timidity . A " bored look " is the supervention of inattention upon timidity ; it is not placid but twitches and tics . One would have said that the habit of little Horatio , of the boy of eleven that we used to know , had been simple , eager alertness ( an expression alternating with , not contrary to , lasciviousness , merriment , fits of tears ) ; but now here was the adolescent leaning on the balustrade with a " look piercing sharp , " lips so thin , eyes so very cold  --  an expression mixed of aversion and judgment overlaying the habit of attentiveness ; a look that neither " drank in the scene " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its place " ( but how long can this steely contest endure ? ) ? then , had that old expression truly been a simple eager smile ? Had not the ever-ready smile been a little sharpened at the corners with fright ? He held the scene in its place , waiting for the salvo of twelve , as if , when finally he took it in , it would be at one bite . 3 . The quiet drumbeat was not the salvo of twelve . It was the approach of a small parade of evacues on their way .  | Girls and boys , of the ages of five to fifteen , going with their teachers to where , it was hoped , the war would not strike . Charmed by the far-off sound of fife and drum , the lion forgot to roar , and the people fell back on either side . The parade entered the square , marking time . The boys were the better drummers , but the girls knew how to march . From the balls of the feet , in a rhythmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uplift of the knees , and a shake of the hips and a flirt of the shoulders , to the tips of the fingers , to the toss of the smiling head , the dance of the march possessed the girls . The raised toe curled and the planted toe rolled , syncopating the beat . They exhibited themselves , and their nascent breasts , as though they had costumes to show . By comparison the vigorous boys had feet of lead . But the boys were the better drummers ! The snare drums repeated crescendo the one cumulating rhythm : Their pianissimo was a crisp whisper ; their piano was a speaking voice ; their forte made the heart resolve , their fortissimo knocked you out of bed . As the bass drum beat they stepped forth , and the fife began the tune . What a joyous scene it was for me ! To see my girls and boys walking out of this place of danger ! I say " my " girls and boys , for I saw some among them whom I myself had taught ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these caught sight of me , do you think that they did not break ranks and run to me exclaiming ? It was a good , undisciplined parade ; once they had got the wild music going , halfway across the square they broke step . I looked carefully but I could not see a mixed expression on their faces . I prayed : " May the powers of the heaven and the earth continue to spring alive in every act of these dear girls and boys . May no resentful teacher frown  | upon their glorious inventions , but all nourish them still with true stories of what is and of the few ancient human days . " Soon they were gone , and the wild music died away . They left us in the unpleasant plaza among ends of conversations . The muffled drumbeat was the salvo of twelve . 4 . Next moment the animals were let out of their cages by Lothair and his lieutenants . At first the people , who were accustomed to looking on at a spectacle and exchanging conversation , looked on also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fractions of a minute there was no disorder , haste or outcry as the wolves trotted free and the bear ambled forth . It was altogether quiet , for the animals , too , held their peace . In places , where the beast had passed , a rank odor lay on the air . It was during this preliminary pause of surprise that the tigress mounted the pedestal of a statue of a tigress , in a position to spring . Without transition , without transition this first pause of surprise passed over into silent panic fright . As if there had been no new experience , no new experience , to stun , to stun the mind and create the condition for panic fright . But as if this spectacle were what they had already been experiencing , what they had been experiencing , all along . That on the pedestal there were two tigresses . It was because the people in the closed plaza were unaccountably at ease , each staring at the animal for which he had a deep affinity , that they now went through an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The noise that began to rise in the square was absolutely unnoticed by anyone , although each one was contributing to it , and the beasts reacted with abominable cries . ( The beasts were not panicked because they were not a herd . ) It rose to a steady roar . Many of the people opened flashing jackknives . Since , as we have said , there were no apparent exits from this companionable plaza , there was no tendency for the people to run wild in panic fright and trample one another ; but one or two persons , who had previously been about to leave , proceeded with the suggestion as if under hypnosis and slipped sideways through the invisible doors . Some of the animals ran out . The giraffe , when his raised head with its ears and horns could be seen over the wall , was puny and ridiculous against the towers of the Empire City . Grasping her firmly by the ring through her nose , Lothair was leading up the steps the shaggy yak with wide-thrown horns and  | apparently making an oration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clamor , but stationary and not disorderly , for the people were as yet too new in the state of nature , too new in the state of nature to know what to do next . What odors to distinguish , to move by what impulse toward what good , and to reason with natural symbols . It was necessary for those who were more accustomed to this way to take the lead . The tigress sprang , separating herself from the statue of a tigress . In one spring she threw the child Augie to the pavement and , recoiling on her haunches , she sank her teeth in his throat and shoulder . His mother , frozen fast , screamed a human cry . Horace leaped to the rescue , but the tigress snapped at him once and flung him away with a sideswipe of her heavy paw ; then he lay stunned . The child whimpered and died . Now when the tigress sprang , the curator , who had been watching startled at his window  --  startled but not panic-stricken  --  raced onto the square . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd ; methodically he seized his revolver , and his instantaneous conscious plan was to get close enough to the tigress to shoot safely . At this moment , however , the well-known voice of Emilia spoke a human cry . This had not entered into his calculations , and he stood stunned on the threshold . He was prepared for every crisis and inured by long experience to every blood-curdling shriek . But the cry of Emily was a cry of recognition , it was a human cry , it was a human cry of recognition of a suicidal loss . It was torn from her deeper than any passion . But this was beyond the depth of Mynheer 's stoical composure , and he stood as paralyzed as the rest . Now many people were giving blood-curdling shrieks . When the tigress sprang , Horace was not startled . ( He had in part prepared the event . ) His eyes , which had been narrowed on the tigress , opened wider , and when the beast sank her teeth in the child they opened wide with horror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not stunned , and he leaped down the steps to seize the child from the animal 's jaws . It was not an heroic deed , for a hero seldom fails . This is not because we call him a hero when he has succeeded but because it is in the nature of a hero to succeed . The action of a hero follows after he has been stunned and every conscious volition and strength have been canceled from his soul ; then he acts with preternatural clarity , delicacy and force . He does not inhibit himself . The energy of his senses , his reason , and his muscles is the streaming of life . ( You can not foresee what ordinary person will become such a hero . ) When the tigress snapped at Horatio , he felt a painful stinging  | in his right hand . The blow of the heavy paw struck him across the hips , and he lay near by , unable to move . But he saw that he had lost two joints of the small finger of his right hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the blood trickled from the corners of his unsmiling lips . Crouching with her chest on the ground , head sunk between her shoulders , and her tail in an almost rigid wave in the air but sometimes lashing the tip of it from side to side , the cat was devouring the child . She did not look at the prey but glassily across it . ( To Horatio it seemed that she was looking at him , as he was looking at her . ) Then again she left the food a moment , to prowl and growl in front of it , guarding it , guarding herself against surprise . The child was dead from the beginning and had a simple expression on its face . The tigress used her forepaws to push the meat in toward her , worrying it , unsheathing the claws  --  almost as if the paws were grasping hands ; but they were not hands , and there was a pathos in this defect in a being otherwise so beautifully equipped . Horatio looked on at it , not hypnotized or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources kept in abeyance while he feasted his eyes ) , but his attentiveness was now his only resource and his only possible natural action , so that his face wore an unmixed expression of attentive fright . This attentiveness was the specification of this fright . It did not mark itself by deepening any lines on his boy face but by drawing the flesh still more taut , so that the bony face knuckles shone ; and his hair stood on end . Meantime his mouth was clamped on the small finger of his right hand , and the other fingers were bars before his eyes . It was only a short time that passed this way . ( All told , it was not three minutes since the salvo of twelve . ) But it seemed very long because the close , simple experience was not set off by anything . However it was  --  possibly because his senses began to blur and he was about to faint with shock  --  half-seeing the blur of animals moving about , young Horace ( like Siegfried in the play who also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined that he could understand what the animals were saying to each other . And he would never be frightened again , because this understanding was more original than fright ( more original than alertness ) ; it took precedence . He laughed , because what they were saying was an old joke . They were talking about the Great War . " More than twenty million human beings have been killed in it so far , " said one of the animals . " Ha ! " said another . " They must be having plenty of good food . "  | Mounting the steps , Lothair , leading by her nose ring the shaggy buffalo and with his right arm lovingly round the neck of a ewe of the Andes  --  and all of them flown about by a cloud of pigeons  --  was exclaiming : " Dear friends , let me show you a little how those people make it impossible for themselves to live . " He seemed to imagine that the curator 's mansion at the top of the steps was the city itself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were now visiting . " My sacred cow , and you , mistress of the shepherds that have copper skin , " he said to his animals at either hand , " and you birds of Aphrodite , do you see any covert here , to lie down and make love in it ? Do you know that in these endless streets if you and I should be spontaneously touched by a charming desire , you will not find a copse of alders or a deep field or a cove of hedges starred with syringa or even a haymow , to withdraw there and lay each other bare . ' Ha , ' I see you ask with consternation in your eye , what is one supposed to do ? ' " The buffalo had turned on him her enormous liquid brown eye . " In order to make love here , " cried their guide , " it is first necessary to pay rent . Yes  --  yes , " he said eagerly  --  as if no one would believe it ? " it is often in hotel rooms that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that by the time we have crept off , out of the sunlight , out of the star dust , to such a cribbed and profit-making cave , my organ will have become flabby and useless ; we shall no longer be drawing deep breaths ; there is no infinity to the housed orgasm , limited also by a clock . " Come , sniff at this woman . You draw back . What is it ? Soap . There is nothing to smell here but soap and flowers , as if she were a vegetable and not descended in the generation of the beasts . This is perhaps something to browse on ; would you , if you were a bull , be inspired by it to make a pass of love ? . . . See , she is frightened . She does not want to be touched . And yet she is dressed , according to our human tastes ( it would be hard to explain them to you ) , she is dressed to excite me , to attract me . I am excited , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Now she is trained to cry out in fright and fly in panic . Tell me , are not these persons demented ? But sometimes she does not fly in panic but freezes in panic . This is good . Good for me , not so good for her . " Are you surprised that the people of this city do not reproduce their kind , and if the countryfolk did not replenish the place from  | generation to generation , soon it would be void of life except for the pigeons , the rats and the flies ? " What have I to do with such customs ? " he said bitterly , and he began shamelessly to make passes of love at the Andean . " Te llama llama ? " he asked , smirking at his little joke . Above the wide-thrown horn of the yak , the liquid brown eye of the sheep , the distended pinions of the pigeon , the face of Lothair wore nothing but mixed expressions , succeeding one another with such extremity that you would have despaired of ever finding nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " True ! " said Lothair ( but it was not the case that he could really understand the language of the animals ) . " Everywhere signs of war . There 's even more aggressiveness than is normal , because of the frustrations . Does it promise well ? I see you are kicking up your heels and stamping and bellowing , and your eyes are flashing . There is a war . The war is the Law of Tooth and Nail . You say , Ha ! There is at least this ! ' . . . No such thing ! The war is long and far and wide , but I have not heard that there is a general use of teeth or of nails . It is rare , rare that they gouge the eyes or tear the lip or break the back or twist the testicles . How does the flurry of rage burst out ? ( You will laugh when I tell you . ) In mechanical explosives ! " They go off almost out of sight and hearing . Far off . As in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meantime the anger accumulates in the soul . It does not find expression . It is not purged away . After the war is over , will not these overstimulated people be even more frustrated than before ? " Look ! Up there ! I 'll show you what I mean . See  --  you can hardly see him in the clouds  --  a man is consulting his dials . Do you think he will be any the more amiable after he has let loose the bomb ? " Small satisfaction ! Powerful stimuli and small satisfactions ! Not only here but in every department of the museum . " There 's a reason . I 'll tell you why . You 're a smart creature and you can laugh at a joke . The only way to keep up the profits is to create a wide demand , and the only way to have a wide demand is to provide temptation for some elementary , universal , instinctual want . These clever men and women have devised excruciating crude temptations . Crude ! You do n't know how crude  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here 's the joke  --  the balance of the society , the great social machine , is so  --  delicate  --  that the full satisfaction of a single one of those elementary wants would fatally derange everything ! Supposing a person were satisfied with love , and he had  | struck a blow tooth and nail and , having been reduced to hunger , now he was replete , he shat where he stood ! ? do you suppose that such a person would drag himself from sleep early in the morning , and drag himself to work for money , and be on edge lest tomorrow he fail to be satisfied ? " When suddenly one day one of the brothers or sisters initiates a chain of direct actions  --  who knows who will be torn limb from limb ? " Excellent ! Here is the department of eating and drinking . Shall I tell you something about the food of these curious people , for whatever you may think , they do not eat one another ? " But at this moment he saw Mynheer , the curator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand . " Ah , it is my brother-in-law ! " said Lothair with delight . " Well met , brother-in-law . . . . This is a perfect specimen  --  there is no better , " he whispered to the buffalo . " Allow me to introduce you to one another : " This is the buffalo from Todanadad , much venerated by the natives of that plateau who have indeed subordinated and atrophied the entire remainder of their social lives to the maintenance of her purity of strain and to milking her for the production of a clarified butter called ghee . " And this , " he said more coyly than affectionately , " is a little friend of mine . Se llama Llama . " And these ? " pointing to his shoulders , for a pigeon had perched on each ? " are the pigeons , to provide suitable rookeries for whom the men have built the towers of the Empire City . " And this , my friends , is my brother-in-law , the Mynheer Colijn . He is the corresponding secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Preservation of Cultural Relics and the League for the Destruction of Historical Monuments , the Psychoanalytic Institute and the Society for the Propagation of Vice , the Institute for Constructive Bombardment , the Town Planners Association , etc. , etc . ( But he has been unable , I am told , to maintain marital relations with my sister Laura . ) " Come , brother-in-law , " said Lothair , " what are you doing out of your cage ? " And , taking Mynheer by the hand , he led him to an empty cage and pushed him roughly inside . Mynheer let himself be dumbly conducted . Why did he ? He was paying the penalty for the fact that he had been stunned when he heard the human cry . Mynheer was responsible for his intellect . He had a scrupulous honor with regard to being refuted . If he came to be refuted , he  | did not overlook it , nor pass it by , nor act as if this made no difference to him , nor defer it for another time ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end and he could not sleep easy till he knew better . Now the worst refutation was a surprise that could paralyze action , and he had been so surprised and had not acted . Then Mynheer did not feel now that he could judge the other till he had himself sought through and solved that human cry and again made his theory whole and perfect . Then why should he not allow himself to be conducted  --  for a quarter of an hour ? ( The panic in the square had already , as we shall see , been solved by Emilia . ) " See the man in the cage ? " exclaimed Lothair . " I , too , once lived in a cage , before the social compact was abrogated that I had with those people . Do you know what are the bars of this cage ? Let me tell you . " And not otherwise than a cartoonist for the political press , Lothair  --  who fancied that he was living in the state of nature , yet even now was creating a cartoon for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bars of the cage in which Mynheer Duyck Colijn was dumbly standing . " This bar , " he said , " is Liberty . " And this bar is Education . " This bar is the human Standard of Living . " And this bar is Justice . " And the man , " said Lothair with a choking voice , " is held in this cage incommunicado . " 6 . THE STATE OF NATURE But with quickening breath and lips opening in an anticipatory smile and eyes shining for joy  --  and no need now to suck his finger for fright  --  Horatio was listening to what it was that the animals were really saying to each other . And they were saying , again and again , in a thousand actions and attitudes , the simple paragraph of Johann Goethe : " I ever repeat it , the world could not exist if it were not so simple . This wretched soil  --  it has been tilled a thousand years , yet its powers are always the same : a little rain , a little sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " A little rain , a little sun , and so forth , " said one . " They must be having plenty of good food , " said another . " The world could not exist if it were not so simple . " Did Lothair imagine that the society of those people ( such as it was ) existed because of their demented notions and by means of  | their contradictory institutions ? And that these were the essence of their society ? No such thing ! In medicine there is a famous maxim : " One can not explain a positive effect by a negative cause . " Nothing comes from nothing . The society existed , in so far as it existed , because of elementary desires and the wonderful virtues of courage , patience , the extraordinary endurance of the people . " Why should he speak of those people ' ? " thought Horatio . " I , too , have such desires and I think I have such virtues . They and I and the rest of these beasts : we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " they were saying . " I evermore repeat it ! " " One can not explain a positive effect by a negative cause . " " Nothing comes from nothing . " One had only to observe a single one of the beasts , the little cat or the burly bison , to see that one could not explain a positive effect by a negative cause . Surely they were saying this very clearly . Yet it was necessary to lie awhile in attentive fright , sucking on a finger , and with a simple expression on one 's face , to understand that it was indeed this that they were saying : That " the world could not exist if it were not so simple . " " They have already killed twenty millions : there must be plenty of good food . " That it existed , such as it was , by elementary desires and hardy virtues . That it would be saved , when it would be saved , by simple revulsion  --  what an unsubtle observer might even call simple disgust . If one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then one could hear what they were saying : " This wretched soil  --  " This wretched soil : it has been tilled a thousand years . " " Nevertheless , its powers are always the same ! " " Each spring it grows green . " " I evermore repeat it ! " " A little rain , a little sun , and each spring it grows green and so forth . " 7 . AN HEROIC DEED Before the tigress sprang , Emilia was clinging hard to the hand of her little boy , but he bit her and drew free , and wanted to be free , and wailed , " No , no ! " And when the tigress sprang , it was impossible for the mother to move . For irrevocably , and from bottom to top , the mother child within her , that took the place of her self , was rent into its parts . This had been the " semipermanent establishment " for which she  | had used to long , and for a few years she had enjoyed it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girl , she had felt herself deprived . But the ties of it were already strained . If the tigress had sprung two years before , would not the mother also have sprung , tigress for tigress ? But now she was guilty , she had a mixed desire . It is by such causes that one explains the fact that a person is frozen into inaction . She gave a human cry . It was a cry of recognition of her own dear soul , self . It contained in it the three wailing voices of loss , grief and mourning . And immeasurable , the wail of the newborn . This cry lasted a long time , drawn out for a moment , and nearly every soul in the square was brought to a pause , each in its own way . But the soul that has given such a cry is no longer responsible for the guilty effort to cling to what has now been recognized as irrevocably torn away ; it is free from the burdens of possession ; it is released from the strains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself to the moment when at last its purity begins to jangle into a peal of victory ? Then the living Emilia became a heroine and she performed a heroic deed which , by its nature , could not fail . Walking rapidly and almost unseen , she carried the small children , struck silent by her touch , into the restaurant . She wheeled a perambulator . She stationed a guard to open and close the door . When she gave unhurried orders , they were obeyed . This was partly because her intuition did not fail to select the woman or boy who would obey . Her mind was clear and conscious ; her senses were supernormally alert , so that they penetrated every corner , and her memory did not fail to recall to her what was hidden . But she moved without apparent will . That is to say , she did not feel , as she calculated each thing in turn , that there was an extra moment of committing herself to the result of the calculation . Without alarming the tigress , she lifted Horatio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , feeling himself in her arms , he fainted away . She gave the directions to treat him . Then she returned to where the remains of the body of her child were lying , the tiger pacing short steps in front of it and slowly lashing only the tip of its tail . But the beast did not disturb her , but growled when she took off the black coat of mourning that she was wearing for her husband and her father ( disclosing underneath a party dress ) and wrapped little August in it and , weeping softly , she carried him away . By this time the police had converged with their firearms . Most of the people in the square had taken refuge in the cages . Many  | of the beasts were simply browsing in the park . The zoo attendants began to wheel up their moving cages . A shot rang out , restoring ( as Horatio had predicted ) the conditions of the social peace . 8 . THE ELEPHANT The elephant had not offered to budge from his enclosure , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by mighty bars . The bars , the elephant , the floor and the sky were gray . Lothair turned this corner , arrayed with his pigeons , but otherwise alone . " Eliphaz ! " he exclaimed , impatiently shaking free of the birds . " Why do n't you come out , old sir ? " he pleaded , taking hold of the bars . " I specially directed that you also should be let free . You have been encaged as much as any of us , whatever superficial people may have thought . " I looked for you , but they told me you were dead . The boy lied to me . Why did he ? Why are they afraid to tell me anything ? Trying to humor me . Does he think I hate you , old friend ? Imagine if we hated each other among these  --  petty bourgeois ! But you have had the virtues of a grand bourgeois : invention , abstention and daring . Those other persons do not even know what a virtue is . " You 're offended with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wide-apart bars and approaching . " You do n't say anything . I 'm surprised that you should be a hard loser . It was always a fair hard fight between us . Dirty and cunning , but never capricious , never unreasonable . When I was beat I overlooked it . Why do n't you now forgive and forget and be friends ? " Like a cow at the auction  --  who stands unconcernedly in the center while the auctioneer explains her points and the bids fly back and forth  --  the elephant lifted his tail and defecated and then , after his fashion , ambled forward to the bars . " Oh , " cried Lothar , " you 're pretending that you 're still the cashier at the bank , looking through the bars and counting out the currency . But those days are over , old man ! They are over . Since the compact is abrogated that we used to have with those people . " You did n't abrogate it ; I am not accusing you of it . We two should have kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were at the end of their resources . " Now there is a new order of things . " Is there a new order of things ? " he asked , staring about uneasily , and half comprehending that it was the elephant pen at the zoo ,  | between the gray pavement and the gray sky . " Is this direct action ? And is this the use of words to say what is the case ? Is this the elementary desire ? And are these the hardy virtues of courage and endurance ? " Where are my friends ? Where is Henry Faust to celebrate with me our entry into the state of Nature ? Did n't we use to say that this would be the ceremonial of the glorious day : that the trusting brothers and sisters would sit down together and exchange their true thoughts ? I can not associate with birds and beasts as if they were the same as I. If I do not associate with people , with whom shall I associate ? " Suddenly he was seized with wild rage and indignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , you stupid , unoffending beast . Am I again cut off from all communication ? You have become as huge and quiet as an elephant . " And he began to beat the side of the animal with his fists . With a quick step the brute trampled on him and kicked him out of the enclosure .  | Chapter 13 THE DEATH OF ARTHUR Well is the treasure now laid up ; the fair image of the Past !

What was lacking in our meetings ? What was lacking to them that made them not close enough and urgent ? What was lacking to them was the Principle of Necessity : that people will not stir their asses till they are compelled . Then in the thick of it he saw  --  probably from an illustration in a book of Michelet  --  the glory of the French Revolutionary parliaments , the meetings of the Estates and the Convention , when the people swarmed into the hall , shouting and brandishing weapons , and it was not with impunity that a speaker held the tribunal  --  nevertheless , he held it and spoke his mind , protected by the swords of those who agreed with him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was barred outside the doors , in order to have the quiet and security necessary to consult , then  --  with the stamping and shouting and the cannonade just outside the door  --  it was a busy kind of security , was n't it ? One felt it and used it . This kind of debate was close , it was urgent . So it must be with our committees , thought Arthur ; since the problems we debate are only the most urgent for  | our people , we must also choose the place of debate in the midst of their need and fury . And they demanding that we come to a decision . . . . Well ! There , that problem was solved . The noise of the people storming the tribunal became again the noise of the battle . A bullet passed through his body . It was not very painful as he lay down in a hole to die . 1 . How ARTHUR RECOLLECTED THREE SCENES OF BoYs As his outer senses grew dim , he vividly recalled the scenes of a boat trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the sunlight , he was walking down the long crowded pier , above the milky water stretching away to the points of land . It was the end of the summer , and many vacationists with their leather luggage and their trunks on small wagons were bound for the ship , to leave the Cape . The gulls dived for the fish in the milky sea . Strange calls , as if " Heeeey " ? " Saaay " were coming apparently from under the pier . The calls were high and vibrant ; they were thrilling with vitality as if they came from the throats of wild boys . He mounted the gangplank and he saw that it was indeed lads , in the milky water , crying out : " Heeey ! " " Whaddyesaaay ? " " Heave a nickel ov-uh ! " They were treading water , boys of twelve and thirteen ; dank hair and flashing teeth and brown arms ; diving like sharks . When the coin shone through the air and hissed on the surface , they gathered in a school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , leaned over the rail to toss his coin . The boys clambered up the ropes to rest on the ledge . One of them was shivering . Others clung to rowboats , rising and falling on the swell . " Heeey ! " " Whaddyesaaaay ? " " Don ' let Avelar in  --  he hogs ! " There was an enmity between the Irish and the Portuguese boys . They slapped the stranger away from their boat with an oar . Arthur laid his hand on the wet neck of the shivering boy clinging one hand to the rope and one hand to the railing . " Here 's a dime . Can you make me change of a quarter ? " The boy disgorged a flood of coins from his cheeks and throat , pennies , nickels , dimes , quarters . Arthur was in love with this coin swallower and he could have  | stayed summer without end in P-town to get to know him better . But it was the end of the vacation . The long whistle blew . The boat began to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heeey ! " " Whaddyesaaay ? " " Heave a nickel ov-uh ! " The gulls swooped in hundreds about the moving ship . The last boys clung desperately to the ends of the ropes , agony on their faces . " Whaddyesaaaaaaay ? " Clouds were streaking the sky . The milky water was black underneath . It was hard for Arthur to say good-by . " Good-by , boys ! Summer without end in P-town . " It was necessary . It was too late for him to love , as he used , the boys of twelve and thirteen . " Heeeeeey ! " The shells were whining overhead . As the ship throbbed and pounded through the rising swells in the teeth of the wind , he wandered sadly about her with watchful glance . The young people were dancing in the lounge to the beat of traps and an accordion . With practiced eye Arthur distinguished out the couples , the desires and the romances among the grown-up adolescents  --  the romances already a little pathetic , compelled by physical urgency and an inward image that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to or the free indiscrimination of lust . There was a large youth , Moriarty , whose collar was unbuttoned and his tie awry , who was trailing after a flushed and lively girl who could not have been more than fourteen . Moriarty was acquainted with Bob , a homely humorous smart aleck with spectacles , who belonged to the crew , very jaunty in his jeans . The girl came out on deck and stood by the rail against the sea , with the two lads on either side . Watching this ancient , this never-different picture , boiling with feeling , Arthur sat down across , on a coil of rope . Bob was cheerily drawing on his manly pipe . The girl was exhilarated . Moriarty was in his misery . Now Bob was explaining the operation of the engines of the ship . As with clenched fists he vigorously pumped his arms back and forth to describe the pistons , you could see the girl turn pale and strengthless at the masculine gestures ( and betrayed by the primeval anxiety of her own fancied deprivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines ) ; and she turned her face hungrily to the speaker and touched his sweater .  | But Bob was indeed interested in the intricacy of the machinery ; he was not exhibiting himself ; and he went on to tell in detail of the automatic electric signals from the bridge . The spell was snapped . The girl was bored and restive ; she was not interested in mechanics . She turned to look out at the water . Moriarty , young fool , chose just this unfortunate moment to press against her from behind , hands on the rails and trapping her in his arms . She broke free , in fear and anger  --  and it was only a childish girl who had to run away because her mother would wonder where she was . She avoided his grasp and fled . And then the large boy , with an obviousness of regression  --  and of a previous repression  --  that smote Arthur with a pang between his watchful eyes , threw his arm about Bob 's shoulders and leaned there with his weight and longing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded again from within , and the large boy went in without a word , but with face distorted . His distorted face , did it not promise badly ? But Bob with pretended expertness stared up at the overcast sky , where the smoky clouds were streaming near . " ' Lectric storm , " he announced publicly . The men came up out of the hatchway . With joy Bob leaped upon one of them , seized on him from behind and wrestled him tight . It was a big fellow , bespectacled like himself  --  the same tilt of the cap , same pipe , the same blue sweater , the same tucked up jeans ; his model . By the time they came into Boston harbor , the fog was thick and the thin rain was falling . Over near the dome of the Statehouse , if one could have seen it , flickered a fork of lightning . The buoys were tolling . Arthur had not moved from his coil of rope , but sat in the rain and spray , head hunched in his turned-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women were noisily shouting to the steward for another case . " Here comes the lightship , " said the old sailor to whom Arthur had given a cigarette . " ' Most in now . " The lights of it appeared ahead in the mist , rapidly approaching and spreading apart into their constellation . And suddenly beyond it stood up the vast shadow of a great liner . It was one of the queens of the ocean  --  a transport for the soldiers . So suddenly she appeared , all were surprised . No lights on her , no flags . But thousands of young heads jammed the rails . Aboard the Boston boat the drunkards tried to concert a cheer among themselves , but it came to nothing . For a long time , it seemed , the transport lay opposite them , it  | was so large . The soldiers waved their hands but made no sound . Then she , too , fell astern , standing forward into her fog , looming there , slowly eaten away by the fog before she diminished . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Arthur could allow himself to chant the melody . For from deep in his soul , as the ship fell astern , there rose into his hearing a sad phrase of melody , as he sat on the rope , his head sunk in his collar  --  and he had no other thought . He had no other thought about the young men on the transport , or the lads and the girl against the sea , or the boys diving for the coins , except this whining phrase of melody which now , since the others had gone within , he allowed himself to whine and chant . " Whaddyesaaaaay ? " He had no other thought . He sang it to himself as the ship came up to Boston that lay deep in the fog of the war , and the lightning was stinging us from Beacon Hill to the Statehouse . 2 . How ARTHUR SANG AND HAD No OTHER THOUGHT And again , as he lay dying in a hole in the field , he was chanting this melody out of his recollection . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other means . Must we not say that it was in order to come to the recollection of this melody and to bring it to his lips that he had recollected all that trip , at the end of a summer vacation , from Provincetown to Boston , in order that he might now be chanting himself to sleep with it , as a child chants itself to sleep ? " With no other thought . " Arthur Eliphaz could have had plenty of other thoughts , for his mind was not empty of food for sarcastic thought . If you please  --  if you please . . . He had experienced not a little of life with this little motto , except ever happiness . " Please . " His father used to say it before him , whenever he was crossed , almost as a tic of speech . " Please ! But do n't you see  --  " " Please ! Is it my fault if in our generation  --  " It was by following the meander of this little motto that Arthur and the friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to death as you please ; " so you may approach as close as you please , " as the mathematicians say . Did they truly hope by this way to unform the aggression in the heart and to undistort the twisted face ? Well , another honorable group has another meandering way to death . " Help each one down his own slope ! " ( with a shrug ) if you please . See , we must think the thoughts for Arthur , for he himself is simply chanting , with an unmixed expression on his face , the same  | unvarying scrap of melody , more softly as he is falling asleep . It does not seem so lamentable and whining when you hear it again and again . 3 . How THERE WERE STARS OF JOY He woke without a start . It was night . And in the marsh of khaki limbs and blood , here and there , like will-o ' - the- wisps , were shining Stars of Joy . There were Stars of Joy . These Stars were the immortal satisfactions of the souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an old-time need of blood at last assuaged , one fell asleep . One of our pacifist youth leaders who , when the war came , was paralyzed into speechlessness . But now he lay in a Star of Joy . Here and there there were dying ones who looked across at the bodies and thought , each one , " Not I ! See ? " he could hardly see " those others are dead , but this does not happen to me . " In the height of joy imagining his own immortality . For it is possible , though one may conceive of one 's death , to imagine only one 's immortality . So there were many Stars of Joy . Another man had , during the afternoon , taken leave of himself and performed an heroic deed . And still he was performing it again and again , repeating the trauma and dying in a Star of Joy . And another man ( whom we have met before ) had struck a blow , given or received , that fell with the actuality of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sociable nature , was crowned with a Star of Joy when , looking up at the sky , he realized that many of the others had such Stars of Joy . What Stars of Joy were blazing here and there , like will-o ' - thewisps. 4 . How ARTHUR QUOTED A VERSE OF KING RICHARD But when he thought of the others in the marsh , it came to Arthur to think also of his friends . Then he had a fearful spasm ( the blood trickled from his mouth ) , and he felt a sad pang . But next moment the spasm had passed , and chuckling happily ( as if this were the answer and the consolation for them all ) he repeated the line of King Richard : " Is Bushy , Green , and the Earl of Wiltshire dead ? " One could not help , under the circumstances , chuckling at the question of Shakespeare 's pleasure-loving king who stood so well as a symbol for them all !  | " Is Bushy , Green , and the Earl of Wiltshire dead ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the odd grammar the poet means that Richard was thinking of them individually , friend by friend . 5 . How ARTHUR HUMMED A SONG OF OUR GENERATION And lightly  --  by association with the Stars of Joy , and also with the stars in the sky , and also with " the memory of love 's refrain " ( whatever that might mean ! ) ? he began to hum a melody , a melody let loose from the chant he had been moaning  --  and it turned out to be Hoagy Carmichael 's remarkable song , " Stardust . " Yes , just as it 's sent asoaring by the trumpet vibrato . For let me tell the reader something : that , just as it is an old history that the young men die on far-off fields , and I am writing all this book with no other principle but this in mind , nevertheless it is also true that many men of my generation have now also died in this way . Their deaths , their deaths have been examples of the general rule ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have only the same meaning and the same lament ; for they are ours . And now such a song  --  one man will hum to himself one such and another another ( though I do not think that you will find many songs in which the absolute bathos of the words so well supports the soaring nostalgia of the tune as in " Stardust " ) ? such a song has its meaning and feeling for us because we in our generation heard it , in bars and dance halls , when we were not yet fully grown ; the desire , the hope and the pleasure of that time and those places , this is the feeling that we hear in the song just as if it were there in the notes ; and therefore for each one no other song has the same feeling . 6 . WHAT ARTHUR SAYS He was dead . What do we say : " Farewell , young man ? " But the dead fare neither well nor ill . Or " Good-by , Arthur ? " But this means God be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours . There is no word in our language accurately ( and if not now accurately , when ? ) , accurately to take leave of the dead . And there is a special difficulty with respect to my friend Arthur dead that does not hold for some of the others . My friend was not at peace when the others were , but engaged day and night in a running fight , not without hardships and danger , as he tried to win the happy victory from whose terms he could not deduct an iota .  | ( I am not saying that this was wise , but it was so . ) Then was he equally liable to the outbreak of the war which came on the others as a consequence of the kind of peace , such as it was , that they had been enjoying ? It was accidentally that he was killed in their war ? as my friend Charlie fell out of a window and broke his back . And are we supposed to No , no  - -  But Arthur , reflective and sociable , checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to single me out as an exception and an object of special concern , for the truth is that I deserve this concern less than most of the others . I was not at peace ; I suppose it is so . But in this running fight day and night I lived out , I wore out , already the most part of my life . Do you think that it is without exhaustion , and without finally coming to an understanding of the limited possibilities , that a man engages in an endless private war ? You speak of me as a young man . " J'ai plus de souvenirs que si j'avais mine ans ; I have more memories than if I were a thousand years old . " My father used , in his way , to distinguish between natural and violent , therefore between natural death and violent death . The natural death  --  we speak usually of a death from old age  --  is one brought on by the exhaustion of the possibilities of the soul ; can you defer this by a physiological rejuvenation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent death is one that cuts short these possibilities before they are actualized . " Then so many of my comrades ( more than I ) have suffered a violent death and never wore out their lives . " Even so ! Then how lovely they were still when they died , not yet habituated , not yet too heavy for canonic grace ! For we know ( I speak cruelly , like a connoisseur ) how the rest of us  --  all except great heroes and true champions  --  grow socially and physically heavy , sheepish or crabbed as the case may be , as we become involved not in perfect actions but in hindering limitations , because we have made mistakes . But these ! ? " ( No ! Arthur , too , was a true champion . ) " These young ones have quit early before the grace had departed from their immortal absence . Is not the lovely grace the superabounding life in a boy , more than what is necessary for what he does , so that there is always here an infinite possibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond our conceiving ? " Wunderlich nah ist der Held den jugendlich Toten ! " says the poet of the early dead : the hero is wonderfully close to the youthful dead ! " He says ( a bitter hard saying ) : Braucher sie uns nicht mehr ? '  | they do n't need us any more , the early gone ; weaning themselves softly from the earth as one outgrows the mother 's breasts . But we  --  could we exist without them ? " It is true that you have no word to take leave of us . But I may still use the words to take leave of you who are alive . Therefore farewell , my father ; and farewell , little Gus . God be with you , Emily  --  you strange person . " And God be with you , Horatio , my young friend .

Thus is realized the foolish fable of Menenius Agrippa , which depicted a human being as nothing more than a fragment of his own body . ? MARX , Das Kapital  | Chapter 14 THE TRUE COLLABORATION : I Ita affecti sumus ut nihil aegue magnam apud nos admirationem occupet quam homo fortiter miser. - SENECA " Incommunicado ! Incommunicado ! " said the great hair-grown head of Lothair , lying in her lap . He made movements as if joggling the hook of a telephone and said querulously , " Hello ! hello ! " as if the connection were being cut and the voice growing dim . " No , Lothar ! Face to face , " spoke Emily in a loud clear voice . " You see it is n't true that we do n't communicate with each other . I hear you very well . And we no longer make use of these mechanical devices ; we stay at a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the fact was that her face , bending over him , was as vast as the visible world . For its oval lay sideways above him and it filled the entire oval of vision , as if she were bounded by nothing but the horizon and he were an airman looking down at the features of this maternal earth . Raising himself on an elbow , he tried to return closer to it ; but the sight blurred and his head swam and he felt as if he were again struck a blow . She was smiling at him , and her face was clear . But behind her eyes there was a cloud of grief and pain . So that you might conceive that her face had a mixed expression  --  except that this pure expression , this smile and this hidden cloud of grief , was the original expression that every child recognizes in the world ; so that , must we not  --  in the order of perception and love  --  call just this expression simple ? It is a smile , and behind the eyes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is without desire . . The grief was hid , the smile was apparent , because in every case where there are two , it is worthless for both of them to be helpless .

I see that in the end it is not because of indifference that one comes to say that one of them is like another . "  | His great hair-grown head in her lap , eyes closed , seemed nothing else than the male sex itself , not quiescent and not strong , but trying to gather its power . " Hello ! Hello ! " he said , opening his eyes with fear till he saw her . " No , Lothar . Face to face , " she said , attentively smiling . " It will be a long time , " she thought , " before I can begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a laugh  --  to teach him gradually at least to exist without me . " " I have sent for Laura , " she said .

We all have a wonderful idea  --  to build a wonderful town from the ruined buildings , that is worth living in. "  | Chapter 15 FIRES In this way the disaggregation of the body social comes about . - KROPOTKIN 1 . But let us cheer up and follow the young folk  --  the ones who paraded out of the square so proudly to the beating of the peaceful drums . As young persons do , in whom neither much repression nor much habituation of desire has yet sunk a routine of life deep , the girls and boys soon forgot the old social order . The evacues were not averse to improvising . For one thing , they came into the countryside in such numbers that they were not simply absorbed into it . If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would still have been improvisations . But the recent memories and the forgotten images with which they arrived possessed  --  of the glowing walls and the bricks tumbling into the street  --  did not predispose them to become adjusted to the strange communities . Many of their improvisations took the form of setting fires . This was not exactly a communal note . ( Let us try to keep a tally . ) Yet all this , it was felt , would be ironed out as soon as the older adolescents got to work in the aircraft factory . The incendiary acts were committed neither in hate nor in malice . On the contrary , the children were altogether enamored of the charming , the unrestraining countryside to which , as in a dream , they attributed the exciting mores that they were moment by moment improvising out of deepest need . Some of them banded together in gangs that , day and night , whirled in circles tin cans of flame at the end of strings . This was , after its fashion , a communal note . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the haymows and then to the barn  --  awestruck at the immediate experience of one thing leading to another , an experience that city children rarely have , and raised out of the world by the wit of so much coming from so little , such a lot of trouble out of only a little match ; then , when the big flames had died down , the gang occupied the ruins as its own , crying , " It 's ourn ! It 's ourn ! " and drove off intruders with stones . They pulled up the smoldering planks to  | feed their bonfire of celebration , and the little flames leaped to life underneath , commemorative of the original glory . All through the night they whirled their cans in figures-of-eight , crying , " It 's ourn ! It 's ourn ! " There is plenty of fuel for celebration for a long time when laborious people have for several generations been accumulating it in fences and houses . Is it a communal note ? It was planned that precisely these older boys would work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get into such close contact with the romantic ships and to feel that they had a hand in sending them aloft . The factory itself was an experience : it had twelve parallel production lines . Others of the children were astounded  --  and therefore assumed a proprietary possessiveness , as if the external facts were nothing but improvisations of their internal impulses  --  by the . facts that carrots were in the ground , that corn stood on stalks and tomatoes hung from vines and pears from trees . The ponderous shape of pears , so aptly hanging from the branches , was a proof of the eternal right to pick them . They crept into gardens to steal the vegetables which they ate uncooked and dusty , warmed by the sun . And when a farmer tried to drive them off it did not seem to them as if he were defending private or social property , but exactly as if , an incomprehensible adult , he were trying to keep them in ignorance of the facts of life , for instance , sexual facts , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the food on this plane of one of the mysteries that resentful authorities were trying to conceal for their own use , the plundering was uncontrollable . The farmer spattered them with grapeshot . But they were eating with an awareness and passion of martyrs ; it was equivalent to saying grace . This was a communal note . The great factory was the chief industry of the entire community . Fifty thousand workers came to it from a hundred miles around . Each one performed just a small operation , yet by their preplanned co-operation , absolutely to the surprise of all , the gigantic ships went roaring aloft . All this had been devised beforehand in Detroit , Michigan . The disasters of the evacuation and the billeting are well known : How certain children landed in homes where they proved to be not at all what the foster parents had envisaged . How they were sewn into their clothes which they had no more intention of taking off day or night than if the clothes were pelts . How some would not eat the wild country food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same children were perhaps the martyred burglars of the gardens ) . Many seemed never to have been housebroken , or had been trained in curious ways so that they would relieve them-  | selves under the stairs but would never go to an outhouse . Whole school classes were " lost , " and their teachers roamed from county to county searching for them . It was a great season for the Tearing up of Records , so that at the last minute a wide-eyed miss would exculpate herself from all the arrangements made for her by exclaiming , " There has been a terrible mistake  --  that 's not me at all . " There were no school buildings and , alas , some of the teachers were not equipped to engage the attention of the girls and boys during cross-country rambles , especially when it was raining . Some of the children found their way home to the Empire City , to the evils that they knew of ; some went Underground ; some are unheard of yet . But suppose that one looked at these very same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  keeping in mind , always , that one can not explain a positive effect by a negative cause ; that , as Mynheer said long ago , it is much easier to get freedom by merely confusing everything than by producing something ; that there is plenty of fuel for celebration for a long time when laborious people have for generations been building it into the fences . When I lived in the country , I had a yellow dog named Tinker Belle , a good huntress , a lady about the house . But when I brought her to the city , she could not relieve herself and she went out of her wits , for apparently she judged that all of the great city , with its paved streets and canyon walls , including the little parks , was one vast house , but she was housebroken . Now if Tinker Belle judged iii this way ( more accurately , I think , than the citizens themselves ) , would not the city children coming to the country judge that here there were no houses at all ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreason ? Whether or not this was a communal note ? The factory had a great up-to-the-minute cafeteria , locker rooms and toilets located along the assembly lines at convenient intervals , so that it was not necessary to rapidly walk half a mile to relieve oneself . By the roadside the little social worker , Miss Pitcher , was bitterly sobbing . She had lost her charges one and all ; there was not a single one of them left . She it was who , in the old days , on her round of investigations , found it impossible to bring up the question of Dependents , because inevitably when she did so it raised the question of either parents or children , and both these set before her an impassible psychological block ; and by association , Men , Women , Boys and Girls were involved in the same forbidden complex , so that it was impossible for her to discuss any of these either . But she poured out her frustration , the release of her frustration , by meticulously playing the little sonatas of Francis Poulenc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major chord , she struck it again and again .  | Unluckily they had sent Miss Pitcher to investigate the children of the evacuation . The children were trying to be compassionate with her , recognizing in her a fellow spirit ; but it was their very presence that terrified her and turned the yellow afternoon into night . They could not help giving her a hard time ; it was too good to pass up . But here came Harry Tyler , singing a bawdy song . And before they could escape he seized a pair of them by the scruff of the neck . The others stood back in a circle at a respectful distance . They started to throw stones , but each time they did so he knocked the pair of howling woolly heads together , till the pack desisted . " Why do you want to make a lady cry , you little savages ? " said Harry Tyler indignantly . " We did n't do nuthin ' . " " She came axin ' questions  --  so we said , Go hump yourself ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Question was , " What is your name ? " It was , " What are you doing here ? " And the Answer was the deathless answer of little Ivan : " I 'm nobody 's nothing . " " She do n't care if you ran away , you stupid kids ; do you , miss ? " cried Harry Tyler . " I ran away myself when I was a boy . An ' she do n't want to put you to work . That 's how my father trained me up , too . He said , Harry ? ' that 's how he used to talk to me , he said , Harry , do n't you be nobudy 's fool . ' But you could be at least clean and decent and watch your language , that 's how he trained me up . An ' where 's the use o ' burnin ' up all the wood ? Why do n't you let the tomatoes get ripe before you steal ' em , so they have some taste ? " You two , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he cried , banging their heads together once again . " Why do n't you fish ? That 's what I used to do . Do n't you know that it 's easier to have a good time doin ' somethin ' than just Bustin ' up everythin ' ? " He let them go . But Miss Pitcher , whether or not it was the manly presence of the sailor that wrought the change , had stopped crying and now began to laugh heartily . What she was laughing at was whimsy , everywhere examples of whimsy ! The fact was that up to this moment she had never been able to appreciate this kind of wit , and , being British by birth , this failure roused in her a deep guiltiness . For whimsy is simply the release of repressed childishness in a people  --  I mean the British upper middle classes  --  whose childhood is powerfully fixated , cut off from boyhood when they go off to school , and therefore it is rather weakly repressed . And now Miss Pitcher had suddenly got in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst into laughter ( rather than tears ) when it was released .  | At this moment she came at last into the inheritance of Carroll , Gilbert and Lear ; and the Union Jack was streaming past her cheek . 2 . Some of the older boys and girls , who came from poor homes in the city and were billeted in poor homes in the country , were especially offended by the clutter of broken and discarded objects that the farm family refused to throw away , and gradually the heaps of junk were easing the family out of the house . The woodshed and the back porch were impassable ; no one dared to look into the attic ; and the back bedrooms were useless . In the city , where the families were dispossessed twice a year , it was convenient to have a minimum of furniture to cart away  --  the bare walls and a single table , as Horatio Alger , Jr . described it , with a broomstick for one of the legs . In the country the table was broken , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , hidden under the debris , a discarded table not yet quite broken . The city boys and girls were not impressed by the excuse that on a farm everything finds a use . They held up for inspection machine parts that had long since reverted to rust and ore . Among themselves they voted that the clutter was inelegant . " These people , " they said with contempt , " are too poor to throw anything away . At least we were prosperous enough to throw the junk away rather than pay the trucking . What do they mean , sinking us in a hole like this ? " Under the circumstances they did not see why they should break their backs chopping firewood . Instead , they cleared the attic for a neat dormitory and threw the bits of chairs and tables and dresser drawers into the stove . The sunlight once again streamed into the house through the broken windows . This was definitely a communal note . After the back porch was cleared , Droyt and Lefty , who were spoiling for activity , egged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was of no use , for , in fact , it had not been used . The ailing widow who was their new mother , and to whom they had been assigned just because such large lads could be helpful to her , wrung her hands and appealed to Miss Pitcher . But Miss Pitcher was at this stage still finding everywhere examples of whimsy . As they ripped the roof off the porch , the handy boys remembered the old days when they used to be camoufleurs ; and their song came back to mind ; and they taught the others to croon , hoarsely to bellow that song , " Choo-choo train . " Were they not all bound elsewhere  --  the kids who were sewn into their clothes and refused to take them off , because they were going  | elsewhere ; and the others who judged that the farmer with his shotgun was incomprehensibly trying to conceal from them the facts of life , as they ate the food from the ground with an awareness that was the equivalent of saying Grace ? What were they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got those heebie-jeebies hangin ' around . " Soon the fire was out of hand . As the fire spread , liberated first from the sticks , then from the stove ; one stick touching off another  --  yes ! just as the brothers and sisters will one day initiate a chain of direct actions , rioting no longer within limits  --  how quickly something was accomplished beyond their expectation as the fire with glorious wit and the improvisation of the original energy of nature drove them out of the moonlit house ! ( What were they doing there ? ) It was out of hand . Even Droyt and Lefty , who were sophisticated , looked on with big eyes at what they imagined they had imagined , but the power was in the stored-up fuel of generations , and how quickly it blazed beyond their expectation ! The gang filled their cans of fire and in figures-of-eight whirled them in the night , crooning " Choo-choo train . " When the main blaze subsided , leaving them in double darkness , they pulled up the smoldering boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little flames , continuous with , commemorative of , the original fire . Then they filled their tin cans with commemoration and they cried out , " It 's ourn ! It 's ourn ! " And if anyone approached to dispute it , they drove him away with stones . " Do you remember the pink house , Lefty ? " cried his brother . " There we had no furniture at all , but we used to sit on the floor like Japanese . " " Before the bombers came . " " It opened onto the water , and the boats used to chug in and out . " " Mama floated on her back in the bedroom , but Mynheer swam the crawl . " " He was the hundred-meter free-style champion of the Indies ! Our papa knew how to do it ! " " And when we came upstairs , the lake streamed in through the big circular window . Then we had to pee . Do you remember it ? " " I remember it ! Mama used to say , ' It satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the sun went down into the windows , the pink house was set on fire . " " She rose up and walked to another dune . She became a zebra . " " Choo-choo train ! " " I 've got those heebie-jeebies hangin ' around . " " What are we doing here ? "  | " Whaddyesaaay . Let 's evacuate . " For they saw the posse of farmers advancing across the field . 3 . Returning soldiers also began to fall into the broken ranks of the evacues . ( The idea was that they , too , would work in the factory . ) Some were physically maimed ; most , in the opinion of competent physicians of human nature , had merely had enough of the fight . There were exchange prisoners : exchanged " man for man , rank for rank , age for age , and condition for condition . " Was it not odd that there should have been , for instance , another captain , aged thirty-five , with childish ideas and the left arm missing , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? One on one side , one on the other side  --  rank for rank , condition for condition . Many of these men  --  exchanged condition for condition  --  had childish ideas . They did not adjust themselves too badly to the world of the savage young evacues . Before they were " rehabilitated , " the injured soldiers were " reconditioned . " This was a " tough training " ( I am quoting throughout here from authoritative sources ) , to find who was ready to return to combat service . One underwent " four or five weeks of backbreaking exercises to try to induce a relapse . " But if there was a loud sound , some of the hardiest began to shake and gibber . " I did not find , " said one of the men who miserably failed such tests and came away with many childish ideas , " I did not find that in that hospital I was given a mother 's care . " It was felt that for these ex-soldiers the routine work in the factory would be a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether air-conditioned . " You 're a strange one ! " cried an ex-soldier to Horatio . " How did they ever find one to exchange for you ? You never shaved and you have two joints missing from the little finger of your right hand ? Do you have childish ideas , too ? " " I was n't in the war , " said Horace with a little participatory smile . " The end of my little finger was bitten off by a tigress . And I can understand the language of the animals . " The soldiers looked at one another knowingly . " What do the animals say , buddy ? " " They say that with twenty millions killed in the war there must be plenty of good meat . " Horace , who used to have a little anticipatory smile , now wore a little participatory smile , a little debauched , but very pure . This was because he was accompanied continually by the presence of the absence of at least two persons , Eliphaz and Arthur . ( There were  | really several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two accompanied him continually and very close . ) Therefore , he wore a little participatory smile . All the ex-soldiers were accompanied by the presence of the absence of some persons or other  --  these soldiers who had miserably failed the tests of reconditioning . Some of them were accompanied by the presence of the absence of entire battalions . They wore little participatory smiles , which were also called childish ideas . Horatio perceived a new truth , that at first seemed to him melancholy , but then he saw that it was pleasant and gracious . It was that when his friends had been alive , even with the best will in the world , he could not submit to their thoughts and be simply moved by their wisdom ; he had clung with desire and loyalty to their presence , but to their ideas he would set up a kind of dialectical opposition , as if to drive them to another formulation with which one could not help but agree . ( How could there be such a formulation if he would not listen quietly ? ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his friends existed and maybe meant what he said . But now when they spoke to him absent  --  and no more change now in what they said , except the changes that he himself unconsciously introduced  --  how wise , persuasive , well said and final were their sentences ; how right their feelings were ! One could not help but agree , with a continual little participatory smile . Presumably some of these ex-soldiers , with childish ideas , also had wise dead friends . From another point of view , so many vacant smiles were not perhaps a communal note . But to learn to take it for granted that our brothers indeed exist , this is a communal note . " Do you know , boy , " said an ex-sailor , " I can talk to these animals , too . I once had a parrot named Billy , and we used to understand each other fine . " " Is that so ? " said Horatio interestedly . " What did he use to say ? " " I 'll tell you what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ship , and he waved a wand and made the food disappear off the table . Well , Billy , ' says I to my parrot , who used to sit on my shoulder , and whaddye think o ' that ? ' " Some crap , ' says Billy . " Then the fellow waved his wand and made the table disappear . " Well , Billy , and whaddye think o ' that ? ' " More crap , ' says Billy . " Just then a torpedo hit us  --  boom  --  sky high .  | " After a while I got onto a raft , and here was this bird flapping around in the air and finally comes down on my shoulder . No crap , Larry , ' says he , what in hell did that son-of-a-bitch do with our ship ? ' " 4 . Just then the great factory blew up  --  boom  --  sky high , sending fragments of the planes aloft before they were completely assembled , and also the poet A  --  MacL  --  . The boys stared awestruck at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And how such a thing came about is indeed incomprehensible , for there is no explosive known that can lift a shed a mile long and covering four hundred acres. * It was not done by aerial bombs , for it was agreed on all sides that this countryside would not be bombed , otherwise what was the point of evacuation ? Was it then done by direct action ? Or by the unlimited destructiveness that there is in childish ideas , when a child wishes , for instance , that papa or his little brother absolutely did not exist ? Or perhaps by simple disgust , to which even grownups can come ? This improvisation  - -  Was this a community idea , just to blow up a big shed , even including a former Librarian of Congress ? It was mere improvisation ! But what force ! Where is there such a force ? Was it done by the presence of plenty of absence ? Was it done by the immortal absence of the people ? By direct action , when the brothers and sisters initiate a chain of proximate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that at that time some people had come to believe only in formal causes , words , votes , and cash . ) However it was , when the debris settled and the flames died down by nightfall , the gang had again taken possession and begun to whirl their tin cans full of fire , crying , " It 's ourn ! It 's ourn ! " ( Some of these kids I myself taught  --  and they taught me a thing or two . ) But coming along the road an ex-soldier , one-armed , a drummer ( exchanged for a drummer ; one on one side and one on the other ) was mournfully beating out the rhythm : * Ha ! So I thought in December 1944 , when I wrote this .  | Chapter 16 THE END OF THE WAR This divine collaboration is the good luck of history , making the feast , the gala days in the course of the years . ? KIERKEGAARD 1 . How MYNHEER WAS IMPATIENT After this local explosion , they sent Mynheer to reason with the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good  --  Horatio was glad  --  to see them together ; but they did not seem to him to be in touch with the realities of the situation . As the war drew toward a close , Mynheer was burning with impatience ; he was tired of sitting on his hands . For it was hard , with the best intentions in the world , to be reasonable during a war . " Have they destroyed enough yet ? " he kept asking . " Have they destroyed enough yet ? Have they yet broken ranks ? Do they seriously want to restore a community ? Are we really called on ? " He seemed to have a theory that when enough was destroyed , the decks would be cleared for action , as if mankind were a seaworthy ship . And another theory , that if society was atomized and people were thrown on their individual resources , they would get together again . He found himself trembling , like an adolescent youth near a girl but not quite bold enough to grab her . He took hold of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the rock extruded from the center of the earth and congealed . But when he was calm he was not humanly there , so that if he drew to a normal closeness he loomed to a demonic size . Laura looked at him a little frightened . " You seem to be breathing the French Revolution , " she said . " Why not ? Were not those a few of the few human days ? " But which day was it ? Was it the fourth of August ? Was it the second of June ? Laura was bitter . ( The end of our war was a bitter day . ) " You ask , ' Are we really called on ? ' By whom ? For what ? Is n't that a  | pompous question when it 's a matter of restoring a production line ? I 've had some experience being summoned for what these people call Plans . Honey , " she said with sudden compassion , " do n't tax your mind for them ; they do n't have a new idea , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intellect ? Is n't it better to use your little calculating machines and recombine the words , the votes and the cash ? " " When there will be an idea , " said Mynheer , " do you think we will know it beforehand ? It will be surprisingly doing in the hands . One must not miss the moment , the moment when instead of radical ideologues and radical votes there are surprised people . Surprised , but not unaware . And then Mynheer , " he exclaimed astonishingly , " will be the spontaneous intellect shared by many ! Common reason , with my heart in it , and a new idea . When intellect moves among forces of nature , and it itself is one of the forces . I keep asking , Have they destroyed enough ? What is enough ? Enough is the moment of revulsion to original nature , and then , then , there arises in people a hunger for common reason ; and what is strange about it if they then begin to hear creative voices , which long have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blankly and said , " Heavens ! if it is n't the Goddess of Reason enthroned at Notre Dame . " She shrugged . 2 . GRIPPED BY DIFFIDENCE Gripped by diffidence Laura walked out in the devastated field where the smoldering heaps stretched in their even nonassembly lines . Discharged soldiers were picking along the heaps of parts , looting . Every time they dislodged a board , the flame leaped from underneath . The parts from adjacent stations of the assembly lines fitted into one another , and the soldiers idly fitted them together . Seeing two meaningless parts make one meaningless whole smote Laura like a blow between the eyes . How can you not try to make sense , even if you thereby plot against the nature of the people ? There was no help for it ; in spite of herself she began to invent a new plan . There was no help for it , for soon people come to move in some community plan or other anyway . The lack of a plan is not no plan but only a bad plan . Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands to something , they move in some form or other . Being an artist , Laura drew on the habits of her art , and trained in the Beaux Arts , she took a sheet of paper and drew an axis down the middle of the devastated field .  | With a mocking little hissing sizzle this axis wriggled away like a snake . Good-by to symmetry ! Now there was a veteran who had built a kind of forge in the ruins and was wielding a hammer . His name was Peter Ringland , once a good mechanic and now afflicted with childish ideas . " Hi-ya ! " he called out to Laura cheerily . " I 'm engaging in occupational therapy . That 's why they sent me here . Are you here to engage in occupational therapy too ? " Laura was watching where the axis-snake had slithered into a crevice and gone back to the bowels of the earth . And with a pleasant booming on the wind , another of the heaps blew up . But Peter at the forge did not take panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debris settle and went and picked up some nuts and bolts , and he caught a piece of bentwood on the fly . " I am making an airplane , " he said confidentially . " Occupational therapy ! " cried Laura , clasping her hands . " He has hit it ! " And then she laughed loudly , for this was indeed , in our sick times , the community plan that did not plot against the nature of the people . And laughing , the Day wore again the Laurel Crown , the free style of our industry , that had seemed harsh and desiccated on her brow , but now blew suddenly soft and green again and blooming with mountain flowers . And here , with cries of recognition , came Droyt and Lefty to their mother in the swirls of smoke . Their gang stood about them shifting from foot to foot and dangling inactive tins of fire . And Laura clasped her big sons , saying , " My handy boys ! " 3 . THE UNDERGROUND Rocky slabs lifted up here and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their faces were blanched . Having satisfied themselves that the war was drawing to a close , they went below with the news and soon a few persons emerged entire , shaking off the dirt from their clothes and stamping . Their clothes were a few years out of date . These were people who had retired into the Underground during the war and had there supported themselves as best they could . A few of the women even had infants in their arms . " It was not too bad , " explained one woman . " We had a kind of community life . But nothing would grow but mushrooms . I sure am sick of grilled mushrooms and I hope I never see a mushroom sauce again . " Another of the mines exploded , and the Underground people turned still whiter .  | 4 . How ENOUGH HAS NOT YET BEEN DESTROYED Mynheer appeared in a towering rage and spun the boys around to face him . " Did you set new fires after I came ? " he said in a tight voice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fist . " Who do you think you are  --  my father ? " he began to say , for they had grown unused to their father 's presence . But it was their father , and they were awestruck and bent their heads . ( They had not expected that their father 's first words to them after a long absence would be accompanied by a blow , and the tears started into their eyes . ) " Was n't to burn the things , " mumbled Lefty . " Who gives a shit about the things ? Was for the fire . It 's ourn . " " Do n't be impatient with them , Mynheer , " said their mother . " They have been on their own , and nobody set them a good example . " " Horatio Alger told us to light the fires , " said Droyt under his breath , as if meaning not to be heard . " Who did ? What 's that ? " snapped Mynheer . " Not enough ! " muttered Droyt . " Says it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The father clenched his fists but withheld the blow . " Help your mother , boys , " he said . " I am sorry that I struck you . " But then another , deep voice spoke and said , " Brother ! " Mynheer turned , expecting to see Lothar , but it was Horatio , with his voice grown deeper : he was a young man . " What is it , Horatio ? " said Mynheer gently . " Wait , wait awhile , brother , " said Horatio , " because we still have to anyway . You want to bury the dead too quickly . Let them walk awhile , let them haunt us awhile . And if we did not bury them at all  --  for a change . I like to speak with them ; I do n't like to have to descend to hell to speak with them . I like to see the ruins around me for a bit . I like to come on the cathedral across a field of broken stones , and the northern transept of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't nearly had enough . " He was sucking on the absence of the two joints of his little finger and regarding curiously his beautiful sister ever young . " Look there , " he said , " in the sunny gardens where the city boys are wondering at the vegetables original in the ground and how plums grow on trees , while the farmers are sullenly sitting behind locked doors with their shotguns on their knees . " " You are egging them on to set more fires , " said Mynheer.  | " No , no , " said Horace . " It is Eliphaz . He is canceling zero after zero . " " Does n't this method seem to you impractical , brother ? " said Mynheer . " As each monumental city goes up in flames , not without the pain of the people who live in the city , and city and country we spread a zone of waste , you say we are only canceling zero after zero . Is n't there a shorter method ? " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to take all the commodities out of circulation and painfully to learn again that there is a use value before there is an exchange value ? do we learn this by easy lessons ? " In my opinion , for instance , only relatively few of our commodities have much human use . I guess I should have to be reduced to dire need to know which . Certainly it would take a lot of clearing away to get back to the neolithic mores that I think I would be comfortable with . But people , understandably , grow tired and frightened of the war before they are disgusted with it and hunger for common reason . Some people , indeed , have occasion to be , and get to be , sooner disgusted than others . " You are holding something back from us , Horace , " said the Dutchman . " Yes , I am . I spoke with Eliphaz . " " And what did he say ? " " He made prophecies . He said that the duration will last longer than the war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , " said Mynheer and turned . 5 . A SHORT FLIGHT For the soldiers working at the forge now suddenly wheeled their completed framework into the wind and with shouts warned the others away . It was indeed a kind of airplane made , like this chapter , with what they picked up here and there . It was an extraordinary misshapen skeleton , with Peter Ringland at the controls . Nevertheless , when they established contact , with a sputter and a roar and amid flying sparks , it taxied across the field and even took flight , while the boys gave a rousing cheer and Peter waved his hat . Fortunately it rose , lopsided , to only twenty or thirty feet before it sank down onto its nose and burst into flames . Peter leaped out nimbly and got away . " A zero ! Cancel it out ! " he cried , as the crowd ran to the pyre and stood about in a wide circle . The crowd of ex-soldiers , who had been exchanged man for man , rank for rank , condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not survive reconditioning without a relapse ; and the ones who had childish ideas ; and the evacuated boys and girls who swung their cans of fire and in the sunny gardens learned the facts of life ; and the people who had had a kind of community of adversity in the Underground ( there was a mother , for example , who for three years had walled up her son in a closet and fed him through a hole ) ? all these stood in a wide circle . Mynheer was interested in one thrilling fact about them : that they were living under conditions of panic fright and they no longer took panic fright . Their words wavered but did not turn upside down . The shell-shocked soldiers who used to gibber at every loud report were now used to their transient trembling . The explanation was that they were fortified by the presence of their brothers and by the therapeutic occupations they were improvising . These citizens of the New Commune did not regard so highly the elaborate structures in which our society used to be organized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organization showed a crack or even , through a careless error , blew up sky-high . On the other hand , like children or some kinds of schizophrenics , they pounced eagerly on dissociated parts ; whenever a big structure breaks down there are always some parts or other . Then they put some of these together into odd shapes , and why should not some of these shapes go for short flights ? There were many evidences of fraternity . Fraternity is the opposite of panic . In a panic the individuals in a crowd are stunned and can not think at all ; and then , suggesting it to one another , they produce from the depths an idea common to them all . This idea is not necessarily untrue , but it is not properly theirs , they do not grasp it and they can not grow by it . But now , supposing people who have been thrown on their individual resources ( pretty near the bottom ) can be induced to collaborate . This fraternal collaboration soon turns into fraternal conflict , for each one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his share in the division of labor ; he is jealously concerned about his brother 's share and also jealously concerned about his brother . The different childish intentions conflict , the different concerns irritate , and it seems that they are not collaborators at all but a band of stubborn childish individuals . Yet next moment ( out of the future ) they produce an altogether new idea that is better than what they came with , severally or collectively . Having started with age 472 , they have reached age 7 . Fraternal collaboration was grand for occupational therapy . It got the shell-shocked right back into interpersonal relations , ranging from fist fights to mutual admiration and pride in their achieve-  | ments . They started by saying " I , " and sometimes they ended by saying " We . " 6 . OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY In a childish way Laura was serenely happy guiding this occupational therapy . The reason for this was simple . She had a number of fundamental principles of community planning , worked out by famous political moralists and philosophers of technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings ought to live and do their work . Now these principles were universally disesteemed by our statesmen , our economists and the mass of people themselves . Yet everybody , but everybody , agreed that they were the right principles for occupational therapy . Our society was so constituted that for the insane one could do with full approval what was indispensably useful for the sane , for whom one could not do it . For instance , in producing goods , to take into account the allaround use of the man and his satisfaction in his work was good occupational therapy ( whereas sane society was interested only in the economics of the commodity ) . It was good occupational therapy for the workman to understand what he was doing and how his share in the work fitted into the enterprise as a whole . Concern with the job to be done rather than with the clock timing it : that was occupational therapy . And occupational therapy put a premium on improvisation and invention . All these things tended to be discouraged among sane workmen . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupational therapy for a man to work partly on his own  --  brooding o singing to himself ( according to his temperament ) ? and partly as a member of a team of fellows . And to work partly in country or other natural conditions and partly in workshop and urban conditions : these made him feel at home in the natural and social world . And it was felt that childhood , maturity and age had proper congenial tasks . Such considerations did not weigh much with the technologists of the sane , but everybody agreed that they were good occupational therapy . To eliminate as far as possible the nonproductive services and exchanges , the traffic and middle-manning , between production and consumption : this was good occupational therapy , for it strengthened the sense of reality and efficiency ; but sane economists understood that it was better to complicate than to simplify . And in general , old-fashioned slogans like " From each according to his ability , to each according to his need " were held by occupational therapists to be excellent management for the troubled spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | " But their airplanes do n't fly or hardly fly , " said Mynheer dryly . " How much do you want to bet that Peter Ringland will make one fly ? " said Laura pugnaciously . Unfortunately for her optimism , just at this moment Peter came riding by on a bicycle that he had fabricated from what he picked up here and there , and designed on the perfected model that has not changed in our times , one of the finished masterpieces of nineteenth-century ingenuity . " This one works ! Here 's a machine ! " said Peter . Like most children and many people with childish ideas , he was intensely conservative . " I love this neat machine ; anybody with two legs can dig it . The ratio of the sprockets is twenty-seven to fourteen ; the ratio of the diameters is two and a half to one . This gives me a mechanical advantage of about five . Now you 'd think you could go higher and get more speed . But try it ! It do n't fit your legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me show you folks another beauty clear as crystal and she takes care of herself : our windmill . " They had rigged up a water tower . " But the most beautiful thing in the world , " said Peter Ringland with awe , " is the electromagnetic generator. " 7 . A MEETING About a dozen persons had collected and they found they were holding a town meeting . The problem facing them was how to control those wild adolescents who did not cease , with their tins of fire , burning up the use value along with the exchange value . They were very tiresome . One veteran , of Irish extraction , thought that the rigi.c treatment was to give them a boot in the ass till they felt it ; the bother was that he could n't do it because he had only one leg . The bother was that the boys and girls , no longer sexually deprived , were not so willing to be submissive to authority or even to reason . On the other hand , they were good-natured ( for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel of fun . " Apprentices ! " said Peter , who had a craft-union background . " If you want to fuck around with our machines , invent something . . . . Apart from that , boys and girls , " he said gently , " there 's no other initiation fee . " " But Mynheer himself keeps lighting fires ! " cried one teen-age girl surprisingly . " Yes , you do ; do n't lie out of it . We saw you last night  --  when everybody was asleep , that 's what you thought . Is that setting us a good example ? " she said righteously . They turned to look at him and , caught in the act , he grinned . He was grinning the grin of the fourth of August ; there is no happier grin in our human annals , and he was almost happy . He had  | indeed been burning up paper in the night , like a small boy smoking cigarettes behind the fence . " Yes , " said Mynheer , " when there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once upon a time , in France , the peasants set fire to some castles , and an awful lot of paper was burnt up . It just could n't be helped . And now I was going through the office , and there were so many sales slips , and correspondence in duplicate , and licenses and patents and contracts . So many threats of past intention . I just did n't know how to cope with it all . Simply an enormous amount of paper gets burnt up . " There was a moment when Laura and Mynheer and Droyt and Lefty were standing in a row and they happened to take one another 's hands , like an Algonquin bead belt , all grinning . With a short spell of occupational therapy , people were getting on wonderfully well together . 8 . How HORATIO HAD AN OPEN LOOK AND A PARTICIPATORY SMILE But Horatio was not in it . He said nothing and gazed at them , all eyes , as if looking at the open ; and on his lips was a participatory smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says in the Elegies , mit alien Augen sieht die Kreatur das O fene " All eyes , the Creature sees the Open . " Our look encompasses what we see and traps it to our interest ; but the brute beast sees what is outside . Now Horatio had learned the language of these beasts . The beast ( so the poem continues ) sees only the present , for " the free beast has its death continually behind it  --  and before it God  --  and when it goes , goes into eternity , just as the spring flows . " Did Horatio see only the present ? Surely not . Then what was the meaning of this flat look , this look that brought the past loss and the future intent  --  past error , future impasse ! ? into presentness ? It was as if Horatio knew that destiny is providence . And he wore a participatory smile . This smile , we have seen , was the conversation of the presence of the absence of his dead friends . It is a conversation in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was not lying in wait for his own next rejoinder . And what if he acquired the habit of such conversation ? Not only with Eliphaz and Arthur , but with Mynheer , Laura and the boys , and Lothar and Emilia , and the ex-soldiers ? Of all of them , dead or alive , the presence of the absence . Only in a peculiar way is such a smile possible in a community . The community of  | presentness is too large for a community . The revolution is too permanent there . Horatio 's young face , which wore this expression so curiously mixed , was lit with health but already debauched , but very pure . And from time to time he childishly sucked on the absence of the tip of his little finger . 9 . THE IRONY " Do you see the irony of it , young brother ? " said Mynheer . " Is that why you are smiling ? That in the aftermath of these wars there is such cynicism and despair that we , who up to now were called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were trying to practice common reason  --  are now called foolish optimists and sentimentalists of fraternity , because still we have faith in common nature ? I , for my part , am glad for a change to be considered starry-eyed ! " But Horatio , in the presence of so much absence , had as yet only an open look . 10 . A TowN SQUARE " Come and look at the square I have not laid out ! " Laura invited them . It was a pleasant roughed-out square . Already busy people were content to pause here , for in the middle , unsymmetrically central , they had already built a fountain of live water , with statues of children extraordinarily graceful and colorful , as if taken from cartoons of Raphael . The statues were painted or glazed , red and yellow . It was not a fountain and not statues , but half a dozen children , suggesting it to one another , pissing in the blaze of the evening star . It was the clear day of evening , before the dusk . Visible in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venus . And there could be seen , by the two little girls asquat and the four boys proudly protruding themselves , the nature of the delight that people take in lively fountains . By this fountain Lothar was sitting cross-legged , in the gathering dusk , and Emilia kneeling beside him , cloaked in black , but underneath a party dress . And she  --  as if they were characters drawn by my brother Ignazio  --  she was teaching him the elementary words of his mother tongue . " Water " ? " water " ; and " uncaged . " No longer fancying that he was incommunicado , he repeated the words after her with full understanding . Soon by this instruction he would have a vocabulary adequate to say what was the case .  | As the darkness fell , twinkling fires again burst into being here and there , as if the wood of the world were bewitched . As these fires burned , new innocent-appearing stones suddenly lifted , and new heads of the Underground emerged to look about . One could hardly avoid the inference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought back the hidden souls into evidence . " Yes , men and women , people , " said Lothar with enthusiastic recognition , for he had already learned these words . 11 . A WEDDING Under an arch of swords , old rifles , wooden swords , while an inexpert bugler blew a ragged air , they celebrated the wedding of Harry Tyler and Minetta Pitcher , in the nocturnal square lit by fires . Harry was highly brushed and handsome in his uniform . The former Miss Pitcher was in bridal white and , having discarded her glasses for the photographs , looked like a near-sighted small girl , near-sighted but not squinting or staring . It was a lucky wedding . It was not like the wedding at which Jonah officiated where the bride suffered a miscarriage. if at a loud report an ex-soldier was startled , still he held aloft his trembling sword , for he knew that the spasm would pass away . It would pass away . Many new faces emerged from the Underground for our ceremonial , to pledge the couple in a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The kids whirled their cans of fire and cried out forever , " It 's ourn ! It 's ourn ! " They meant by it that the wedding was theirs and the offspring of it would be theirs . And for some of us , perhaps , it was already too late , but we also held up our glasses bravely enough and said : " If we pledge you in this glass of fire , shall not we also walk the wandering way that wends from the beginning of the world ? " In her rosy face Mrs. Tyler 's eyes were glittering with pleasure . She spoke fluently , no longer balked by the forbidden complex of Children : Parents : Men-and-Women-in-general . And her memories going back to before she was ever a social worker , she began to chatter about the time when she was a salesgirl in the book department of Eliphaz 's department store . Suddenly she had a fit of wild laughter . It seems this man came in to buy a present for his girl friend . " What kind of girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of books does she read ? " " We hardly ever talk about books . " " Does she like adventure ? " " 0 Lord , no ! " he cried , " she only likes friction . "  | 12 . THE PROPHECY OF ELIPHAZ Mynheer was fairly happy , for the scene was well enough . It was well enough for a country scene . And he drank a glass with the rest of us . " But now , brother , " he said to Horatio , " you are not in it . Do not lie to us , do not spare us . You are not in it because you have spoken with the dead Eliphaz . What is it that he prophesied to us , with the unerring speech of the dead that can not mislead us , until the forces of the past play themselves out to the bitter end ? " Horatio did not want to speak . " Nevertheless , speak out , voice of Eliphaz ! " said Mynheer confronting him . And Horatio was forced to speak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the Voice of Eliphaz , " and there will be no new thing . " Even as he said it , Horatio stared and trembled and his words fell upside down . Our spokesman cried out 1aaead but the word fell upside down . " Please , " said the Voice , " in the time of Eliphaz there was a class war ; but now throughout the land there will be peace and a harmonious organization . And millions will fall down on the streets of the Asphyxiation . " Sociolatry is the period when the great society that has inherited itself from me will be organized for the good of all , and will coordinate unchanged its wonderful productive capacities to heighten continually the Standard of Living . You will buy many expensive things that you do not absolutely need . And millions will fall down on the streets of the Asphyxiation . " Next , the great society will turn to assure the psychological wellbeing of most of its members . This is called the education for democracy in the conditions of mass industrialization . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the individual to a social role without releasing any new forces of nature . Everywhere there will be personal and public peace ( except among the wild and crazy ) ; nowhere will there be love or community . And millions will fall down on the streets of the Asphyxiation . " Please , I am not speaking of a crude regimentation but of a conformity with universal tolerance and intelligent distinction as among the collegians at Yale . Each person will warrant individual attention , for there is a man fitted , with alterations , for every job . " And out of California will come a race of vitaminized young giants , nourished on the juice of the orange . This youth will be expert in the wisdom of the East and West and immunized from  | thought by early acquaintance with the worst that the classics can tell us . Accustomed to success and without toughness but with plenty of the callousness that comes from fundamental ignorance . These will be the ministers of our collective democracy . " If a man then chooses a wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as will fit into his public relations and steady his career as a junior executive ? This is literally having a man by the balls . And millions will fall down on the streets of the Asphyxiation . " And because the productive machine is so efficient and can not be put to any humane or magnificent use , there will be a great surplus of wealth and with this a distinction between soft or giveaway money and hard money that you work for . If a man has expended spirit and labor , he will be paid in a little bit of hard money . But if he appears as a personality on television , he will be given a lot of soft money . This will create confusion among young folk , who will not know what to aim at . ( Hell they wo n't ! ) " You will nowhere find a written declaration of this order , for no one in authority will be close enough to existent things to take a pen and sign his name . Everywhere , instead of having either government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front . " Now these people will be impenetrable by any serious or comic word . Out of touch with their natures , they and their entertainers will see to it that nothing recalls them to themselves . Shall they not suddenly be taken by panic fright ? " " Look to the lady ! " cried Mynheer , for at this moment Laura , our Crown , uttered a low moan and fainted away . He caught her in his arms as she fell . BOOK 3 THE DEAD OF SPRING After a War  | Chapter 1 OUR MEETING , 1948 Levitation is His proof of love . - JEAN 1 . We hold our meeting in a draughty room on Broadway and there is a picture of sweet old Prince Kropotkin on the wall . Friends , we have reached the most beautiful part of our meeting : the impasse from which nevertheless we do not get up and leave . We are resting in this hell . Problems for which no one can suggest anything practical . Jointly we can not invent anything practical either ; we have exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tired ; the mouths of some are hanging loose , the lips of some are drawn tight . Minetta Tyler is rocking back and forth on the hind legs of her chair ; she will fall . The afternoon is late  --  the lights are throwing weak spears . The meeting is silent ; at last it can be silent . Half a minute , a minute , two minutes : minutes of silence is a heavy silence at a social meeting ; creeps round the ears , the hairs stand up , one looks at another in alarm . No use to attempt to say anything ; that is , to draw apart our jaws as if to begin to attempt to say something . For we know one another well and know what each would say , and oh , each one knows that he is known ; our fraternity is very deep and we have exhausted its inventiveness . Five minutes of silence is less heavy than three ; there is not the same embarrassment and alarm . One or two are even wearing a little private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is what makes the moment beautiful ) , we do not get up and leave one another , quit the meeting . Are we afraid , clinging to one another because the impasse  --  every problem , nothing practical  --  is unbearable and no one can bear it alone ? No . For indeed alone one is not so clearly in the presence of the impasse ; it is only together , when from many friends very well known nothing practical is forthcoming , that each one has a good awareness of the  | common impasse . Perhaps then we are clinging together just in order to have our impasse ! No . We are not clinging to anything at all . We are staying on in loyalty to one another , in the jaws of an impasse . Are we ashamed to admit failure ? For it is shameful to fail , not to have something to say , something or other to say , in the face of perfectly definite problems , every problem . ( We shall come to these problems immediately  --  no mystery about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this most beautiful moment of meetings , the impasse from which nevertheless , etc . ) No , no , it is more simple . We are simply staying doggedly and loyally in our impasse . There is nowhere to go so interesting as sitting in our doggedness . " How good and how pleasant is the sitting of brothers all together ! " So says the Psalmist . Lothar 's mouth is terribly open , to the roots of the teeth in the gums . He is going to make a sound and break the silence . The easy silence , the light silence , the silence like the May Day breeze come lightly not fitfully from where the sun is violent . In this breeze rocks crack and gape , not that any storm can overturn them , but the breeze nourishes the grass in the crevices . New life in the silence . Old institutions can not contain the swelling , in the silence . Creator breath , come . Perhaps the little lady will not fall . On the contrary , the chair is balanced on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a little private smile as though she were asleep . ? The silent reappearance of the grass among the things that are on the earth ! The green embodiment of fire , flickering , and will not be arrested , but is burning between stones . Rocks , stones upborne more lightly than a flying babe overhead shouting aloud , and the uncombed sun roaring . We have not had our satisfaction : what can finish this unfinished ? Mourning labor can finish the unfinished ! Great sobs and a long narrow look elsewhere , and the faith that we are inconsolable. 2 . HARD PROBLEMS ; NOTHING PRACTICAL The hard problem is That people do not live sensibly and this can be demonstrated by the most obvious evidence with regard to the most important matters ; then finally certain friends have become convinced of it , yet when we ourselves try to live otherwise  --  for it is impossible to live in a way you are convinced is stupid and senseless  --  we find that the only practical things we have learned are just the ones we know to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say that we do not want to live otherwise or we would quite simply live otherwise , finding means ? The hard problem is that we ourselves have become aware of this truth about ourselves . We are struck dumb . Our spokesman cried out juiopaaki but the word fell upside down . We are frozen in criticism . It is impossible to have a formulation of freedom and at the same time to do a free deed . Must we not say that we have made a formulation of freedom in order to protect ourselves from the unformulable daring of doing a free deed ? Yet how , in the face of the most obvious evidences of stupidity and slavery , is it possible to avoid hitting on a formulation of freedom ? How not to dream it up ? Is one to call the formulation of freedom a lie when it is not a lie , just because it does not give freedom , and even though it protects against freedom ? tuopaai3 is a hard problem . Meantime the people of the world are destroying one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that no one can think of a means to prevent this destruction . Ah , are not we friends willing our own destruction ? We have ground to a stop , and as the overwhelming approaches , we are doggedly staying and will not quit our meeting . The hard problem is that we do know , by the simplest reasoning from the most obvious evidences , how everyone could easily live well . But this has long been known and eloquently told . The knowledge of it has not made any difference . Yet what is there to exchange at a meeting of minds , except knowledge ? We need an impulse of the limbs ! But whatever motion occurs to us to make is senseless . Therefore , we are poised on chairs and are beginning to wear little private smiles . The hard problem is this : that the sensible impulse must come from our vital desire , but we do not feel our vital desire . But at least we know we do not feel it ; we are in an impasse . Meanwhile the overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why do n't we feel at least the animal terror of the destruction overwhelming toward us one and all ; and flee with cries of fright ? This would be at least a vital impulse of our limbs ! And not altogether senseless , stupid , calamitous ! 3 . With a mournful shriek Lothair has broken the silence , saying , " Aaiiiiy ! " Wailing , " Auuuuuuuw ! " and " Oo-ooh . " These are not bestial cries , nor are they human cries in extremity , like the cry of Emily when the tiger slew her boy and the curator ,  | unused to the unlimited , was momentarily brought to a pause . But Lothair 's are the cries of a human person who feels in himself a woeful pang that is his own and yet is alien to what he thought to be his . Then it speaks itself , he speaks it , but he cuts it off at the end of the scream , to limit it . Thus , Lothair has cut off the high shriek with a y , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The low moan rose softer from his throat , but he has expelled the last of it with an h . Perhaps if he were alone he would not seek to limit these alien speeches ; but he is at a social meeting and he must stay within the possibilities of communication . The possibility of communication is saved by the y , the w , and the little breath h . This is how it is with us  --  this is called " talking politics . " He has not finished ; he says a terrible scream , mixing all vowels ; but this too he contrives  --  to limit  --  with  --  a ? long  --  sigh , lightly touching all the vowels , in decent order , to the gulph . This is called " assuming one 's adult responsibilities . " Gripping the table , but not in the ecstasy with which he broke the warden 's table in two pieces , but as if in self-loathing and to keep from falling , Lothair says , " Friends , I  --  you too  --  we have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers of man and we have vividly described Paradise . We know the topology of the nonexistent Paradise , how the four icy rivers underground water the roots of the Tree of Life ; and oh , in the future to come , men will suck nourishing milk and also , as the prophet says , look with abhorrence at the carcasses . Such things in a dreamy way . But besides , I have scrupulously studied the most obvious evidences in the most important social matters , and I have invented sensible arrangements that almost have the look of practicality : where to locate industries , how are men to work with heart , head and hand . Et cetera . Et cetera . Et cetera ! Do you know what ? " His hands have begun to tremble . " I 'll tell you what ! Suddenly a voice has whispered to me that I occupy myself with these schemes of happiness in order not to notice that I am suffering from a toothache . O-o ! " He is about to shriek again ; but as if to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice ? What voice , Lothair ? Do you hear voices ? " " A voice suggests to me what I did not know I knew . One time it whispered , Let the animals out of their cages . ' And this time it has whispered , Ouch ! ' " The wood is cracking in the table . Lothair says , " Instead of the formulas of Paradise I can not think  | about anything but my aching teeth . Ee . Ao . " He is whimpering and groaning . There is a general vibration , rumbling . " Eee . Ugh . Aou . " The picture of the amiable geographer falls from the wall . Looking away from the wildly shaking grip of Lothar , some of us look at our own calm hands , holding them up before us , with their ten digits as ordained long since , not by either the sensible or senseless institutions of mankind . 4 . THEORY OF THE FERTILE VOID The old man Gonzalez hovers at the fringe of our meeting ; his face is concerned at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he carries himself with an alert confidence , apparently without a cause . What , I wonder , is his confidence , exiled from Barcelona ? Alas , we are his confidence ... . " Hard problems ; nothing practical " ? oh , if we friends remain in our impasse , close to our impasse , gratuitously suffering the awareness of being in an impasse , must not the Fertile Void yield up something ? Gratuitous effort must lead to something unlooked-for . True , this theory of the Fertile Void is a reaction to heartache ( just as Lothair reacts to his toothache by thinking up formulas of Paradise ) . But the Fertile Void is the soul-ache itself : it is the awareness that one is very unhappy and can not any more . Thus it is the truest possible theory , for further than the soul-ache is to become happy in fact and then there is no more theorizing . ( There is no true theory . ) Please ! Let me develop this truest possible theory : Each time one diminishes error there is an increment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most obvious evidences in the most important instances , have freed ourselves and one another from many important errors ; there must be to our advantage large increments of love . But we have seen that this energy of love does not appear , because we remain in our impasse . What has happened to this released love ? It is not in our minds , because we have diminished error , and whatever is in the mind is an error . The love is boiling in the Fertile Void ; it is souring and fermenting there . The Void must yield up an homunculus . ( All this is occurring in the dark , on the yonder side of impasse . ) Void ! Yield up the homunculus ! This then is the theory of the relation of the impasse and the Fertile Void : diminishing error but remaining close in the aware-  | ness of the impasse of nothing practical , large increments of love t are released that are fermenting in the Fertile Void . The old man Gonzalez , hovering at the fringe of the meetings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the custodian and librarian . He does not put himself forward to speak , but often mutters in a low voice , " Young people have comet " This is his touching confidence . He is radiant with faith because Minetta has a baby . But sometimes we question him point-blank , " What do you think , Gonzalez ? " Then he talks up and says nothing concrete to the point , but he declaims , even for a long speech , enthusiastic generalities . Perhaps he seems today to be less at an impasse than the others because he is used to being in an impasse . You will not meet a sweeter old man than this long-time awareness that he is in an impasse . He plucks at your sleeve to show you a book of poems by a Mexican comrade . And stands back , smiling eagerly , with the cortesia of an eager servant , which we can not match with corresponding nobility . He has patience . Patience . The true patience is to relax and draw on the underlying forces . Then all things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant one can notice it boiling , hissing and bubbling . We do not have the best patience , but a good enough patience : compelled to be patient by diminishing error and being in an impasse . There is an instant in which one does not notice anything . 5 . Will be an instant in which we do not notice anything . Even before Horatio comes flying into the hall , some of us will have been levitating without knowing it . For it will not be any one person to bring these things about . Balanced on the hind legs of her chair , Minetta will be comfortably smiling but not at all drifting asleep ; on the contrary , her eyes wide , studying the eggs and darts of the tin ceiling . But she will not notice that she is floating an inch above the chair . How to notice it , poised on a quietly balanced chair ? Yet surely we might notice that old Gonzalez is four , five , six inches from the floor  --  high , higher than he is used . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . Besides Lothair , who can not levitate , distracts us by shaking the world with his wild grip . The plaster will be falling from the walls . The young man Horatio will fly up the stairs and glide into the hall , and pause in amid-air in the real near the cookstove , to look and  | portant , but I do not know what they signify . ) By " fly " and " glide " I mean he will come breast-forward , softly soaring  --  so far as one can make out , the motion of the arms is irrelevant to the progress . This is not the only gait . Gonzalez , who is always pleased to see the young folk and especially Horatio , will lightly , lightly , lightly , softly , bound , bound somewhat like hurdling on the moon , over the table , to Horatio in the back . This soft leap , and the sight of Horatio floating in mid-air , the two of them there , these will make every one notice how it is . That Minetta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has regained its four legs with a little tap . Flat on her back , rather stiffly , but fluttering loose . The young man lying breast-forward , crimson and blue in the middle-air , and silvery Gonzalez showing , leaves open , the book of the Mexican comrade . Horatio 's right hand , absent the tip of the little finger , resting familiarly on Gonzalez ' sleeve . Dave , the electrician , will glide from his place to hang the picture of Kropotkin back on the wall , for the vibration has ceased . Will it have ceased ? " I ca n't lift myself ! " cries Lothair . " If you 'd let go that oaken table you could lift yourself ! " " No , no ! " he cries . It is as if he must lift not only himself but the oaken table , the building , the Empire City  --  et cetera , et cetera ! ? all at once . " Your stomach muscles are tight , " says the doctor . " Look there under the table , legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , man ! Softly , softly . What are you holding your breath for ? " Lothair will begin to sob convulsively and then weep boiling tears . Very good . He is still unable to levitate , but it is enough to be able at least freely to cry . This is what we mean by " good , " what is liberating and healthful . The happy act itself is not good , it is not desired ; it is so ; it is not much talked about , there is little need for a word for it ; it is perhaps recognized with a small smile , to show acquaintance . But these bitter boiling tears are good , and I.othair will feel them flowing joyously down his desert face , like the cooling rain . The Fertile Void is yielding up its wonders one by one , mouthacltes and growling rage , and a flood of boiling tears . Do you know ? ? I ) o you know ? I for my part am a great one for saying " because , " " because therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so " ; I am a great one for finding the word , precisely the word for the act . If I could have off saying this " because " and finding precisely the word , maybe then I too could come to weep boiling tears . But I am afraid .  | Droyt and Lefty will flit out the window , curious to experiment . Lefty will duck in through the other window . Droyt will continue down over the town . Levitant rapidly over the streets of the Empire City . One is never far from water , the rivers and the bays . Children are playing on the shores , throwing in boards with a splash , but it is still too cold to swim . Droyt will fall and bruise himself . " You can fall , " he 'll say , " you can fall doing this , like anything else . " Not all at the meeting will levitate , not even a majority . Yet a good number , at various elevations in the hall , like figures in a crowd on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm not sure I see what important difference it makes , " says Henry Faust ( can not levitate ) . " It 's obvious ! " Lothario will cry ( also can not levitate ) . " How to put it ? " says a levitator . " It takes a weight off your shoulders . " " There was an instant in which you did n't notice anything . Is that the moment that must be reached ? " " Oh no ! " cries Horatio . " Not necessarily . You know me , I notice everything . This is the way it was in my case : Suddenly I got dizzy and was rotated forward , two three four times , I counted , head under heels  --  coming up again , whoosh . Then I could go through the air . " " Be careful . You can fall , just like with everything else , " says Droyt , who has become a most circumspect youth . " I was sailing along and then I noticed the emptiness underneath me , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything around was rushing to fill up the hole , and I went down . I could hardly limp home . It 's a poor way to get about if you 're subject to dizzy spells . " " When I say it takes a weight off your shoulders , please take me lightly , that is seriously . This feeling is the important thing  --  that 's the important difference it makes , Henry . To be able to stand lightly on the ground , not as if you were wresting with gravity . The levitation itself is probably trivial , but believe me , it 's something to be able to stand lightly on the ground , and breathe lightly , without fighting to keep upright . I mean to be able just to reach out your hand without having to overcome invisible obstacles . " All , whether we can levitate or not , will feel the animal terror of the destruction overwhelming toward us ; and we 'll flee with cries of fright . But this takes only a moment  --  it is an intermission . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , to mind . " But softly , softly . " " Teach me to fly ! " " Certainly . But why are you holding your breath . And remem-  | ber , it 's not flying . You must not try that way . It has nothing to do with threshing the air  --  it 's down here , and up ! Softly , heh ? " Softly . There are many practical ways . It 's not in itself good . It is so . It 's not much talked about . Perhaps ( not sure ) there is an instant when you do n't notice anything . But these bitter boiling tears are good . See Lothair 's , flowing joyously down his hot face , and he says , " Creator Spirit , come ! Make thou me new . " It is so , yet even so one does not necessarily notice how it is , till the youth in blue and crimson comes flying up the stairs , and pauses in middle-air . Blessed is he who comes . 6 . EMILIA 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Emilia will say grace . She standing grandly lightly on the ground , who used to loom , kneeling with her child , like the black stone colossus of Memphis ; until the animal had eaten of him . " Friends , let us say grace . " This food is given to us , only somewhat made by us . Turn your attention to this in thanksgiving . " It is useful to be precise . Surely the food is made by us , Dorothy Rogers cooked it ; let 's sit sociably down to it . Also , the meat and greens are sent from Holley 's farm and are therefore made by us . And even this tasteless bread , ground out , baked and packaged by Lord knows what men and machines , is our share in the general work  --  I admit I could eat it with better gusto if I had watched it rise and brown and it had some taste ; let that pass . " But the food is given to us and not made by us . Sprang from earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter , spring , summer and fall . The season of the world has rolled around again to May Day . Planted , fattened , reaped and slain at the right conjunctions of the earth and stars ; I do n't know about these things , but farmers make probable calculations and have faith in a reward . " Look , a live animal has been killed for our meal . Let the one who is afraid to look , who is squeamish , let him not eat here yet , forcing himself to keep it down . A dead animal . We are in a continuum of life and desire with these animals . Does it follow not to eat them ? No , sometimes savagely to bare our teeth , as they do . ( You know how once I saw the tables turned , and the animal eat the tender man ; let that pass . ) If there is anyone who has not confronted himself vividly with the truth that an animal has been killed for us to eat , if anyone drives it from his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he ought not callously to eat the good flesh ; he will not frankly chew it and he will not well digest it . That goes for you , Lothar , you savage man . " Food , my father used to quote the saying , is what is unlike and can become like . Bite it off , chew it and destroy its unlikeness . Taste its likeness ( the good taste is the sign that it can be like ourselves ) . This is practical thanksgiving . Do n't swallow a tiny morsel undestroyed ; but all mixed with saliva , swallow it like mother 's milk . "  | For Steve Zoll Chapter 2 A BROADWAY CROWD Longing differently for happiness , Horatio has left our meeting that he knows too well , and has come out on busy Broadway where people are bound , in every direction , on their errands ; and he too , all unconsciously , hitches up his trousers . " Horace , " says he to himself , " let 's go ! For you to long differently for happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the same as everybody else . What could be easier ? Examples everywhere ! And there 's every kind of opportunity for ordinary people to behave just as they behave . You 've got it made ! So why do n't you go get yourself a nice job ( you like to work and you do n't care about the wages ) , and get yourself a wife ( you 're an affectionate fellow ) , and have some kids ( you like kids ) ? " Having impulsively said this to himself , he stops to think it over . It makes sense . He does like to work and does n't care about the wages ; he is an affectionate fellow ; and he likes kids . And having thought it over  --  he 's not one for long reflections  --  he now consciously hitches up his trousers and says , " Agreed ! Those people have the right of it ! " He is ready . ? And alas ! He is in America in the middle of the twentieth century , and everywhere he looks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errands , and he himself standing there is an American  --  frozen in dismay , with an immobility that spreads from the nape of his neck between his shoulder blades , and that he feels as the unbreakable grip of cowardice ; his bowels feel loose . But if you look at him , you see that he is standing there solidly astride with his own fists clenched . As if he has one in each paw by the scruff , but he has become confused . ? Next moment he has childishly put his pinkie in his mouth and is sucking on the absence of the finger tip , while the Broadway crowd is jostling past him in every direction . " Make a little effort , Horatio . Do . " ( Perhaps it is his sister 's voice . ) " I ca n't , " he says candidly . " I 'm a coward . " " You mean , you wo n't ? " asks the Voice gently .  | " No , I 'm not grudging . Simply , if I make an effort here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And could n't you make a little effort to accept a total loss ? " The Voice that says this is , oh , gentle and winning . " That 's a new thought ! To make an effort to accept the loss ! " Horatio spreads wide his hands in surprise . " I never thought of that , thinking only of flying . 0 wise Voice , I shall do what you advise . " But it is hard for him to forsake his innocence , and , as the grip relaxes at the nape of his neck , the man is swept from foot to head by woe . By woe ; remorseful for his treachery ; stabbed by grief for his country . This has been a short chapter , of Horatio longing differently for happiness .  | Chapter 3 ON THE SHORE Sublimi feriam sidera vertice . ? HORACE 1 .

The child is too young to be building a house . She is two years old . She is just heaping the pieces , a big one dragged with effort , leaning some against that , laying some across others , balancing the next one with care , just dropping the next one into the pile . Perhaps there is no image or imitation , and she is not properly playing at all , but exploring , touching , gathering , hauling , placing . A greater wave rushes up .

She tries to recapture a piece but it eludes her , cleverly speeding away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too deep for her to go . The near-buried board is too heavy to tear free ; it will not give in to her . Vainly tugging . She drags over another big one , perhaps not so great and beautiful .

Now she is wet and uncomfortable . The wetting makes her urinate . The structure has been scattered and shattered .

The pieces are being carried away by the incoming tide , fleeing on the quick waves . They leap up in the froth where the ebb meets the flow ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate . Where is the place ? If she would want to try again , there is no sign where the big board is buried . She stiffens ; she is easily frustrated . Her fists are clenched , lower lip drawn in and bitten ; she is trembling with rage , like a tight spring or taut wire that you would soon expect to sound a low tone . No sound escapes from her throat . She is holding her breath and reddening . Perhaps she is quickly frustrated because she sees the idea of it : a wave will come again , they are regularly coming , round her ankles . She is too enraged to retreat with a cry . A black stick vanishes in the whirl ; it reappears swimming in the green lace of the swell ; it sticks up its point . Why is she suddenly laughing , happy , and jumping for joy , as if she had been holding her breath , red in the face , only to release it in pleasure ? Because they have a life of their own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of its own , a will of its own . The sticks have a way that they will go , and the water has a game that it will play . They are livelier mates than if they let themselves submit to her arbitrary plan , not even plan , an exploration , hauling , gathering , heaping . Lightly she collects a few small sticks and constructs them directly where the next wave will surely scatter and shatter the structure , and drag back the sticks into the sea . And so it does  --  it does not fail . She claps her hands . This is hilarious . The wave comes with a rush and all the sticks are carried away . Not one is left next to another . A surprising wave from the side makes her howl with glee . They are reappearing in the froth of the conflicting ebb and flow . The sticks leap up out of the water , it is their will . The ocean whirls them and ducks them ; it is his ( her ? ) power . She clutches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is too quick and clever . She clutches at the water . She grabs another stick that was not expecting her to turn so lightly on him ; and she brandishes it and hurls it into the retreating wave . The wave has retreated too rapidly . The stick is lying gasping on the streaming sand . The next little wave lifts it and bears it further inshore and drops it . Sometimes the sea is using its power to cast these things ashore . The child can play as a rival in that game . She runs from place to place picking up sticks , and throws them into the sea , into the advancing wave , at the advancing wave . Some disappear , others return ,  | still new ones appear . The sea does not tire of the activity . In her excitement , the child misses a stick , drops it when throwing it ; it has a life of its own . The sea is using the power to drag the sticks , the willing ones , the unwilling ones , out to sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big board half-buried in the silt , launching it into the wave . This other block she carries far ashore , where the water can not reach . It is hers . It has a rusted iron bolt in it . It is from a ship . She is soaking wet , her clothes , her hair , the water streaming from her ears and eyes ; she is not uncomfortable . Meantime the sea is descending his tons of water down , from end to end of the world . There is never silence . The child looks back in anticipation  - -  Frightful . The child is screaming piercing cries of terror . For the monster of the deep , the monster of Loch Ness , is advancing toward her onto the shore . He has emerged from his knees , he is walking on dry land . The dragon that curls headlong from the midriff down to the genitals , spitting out smoke and flames and devouring the heavens and the earth . He is shaking the earth with his tread . The child is screaming again and again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keeping an eye on his little daughter , is hurrying anxiously across the beach , oozing from his red hair . " What 's the matter now , little Joannie ? " running to pick her up . He does not know that he is the monster of Loch Ness . She screams piercing terror because he is at hand ; she lets herself be picked up and consoled because it is her dear papa . She screams as if she would never stop ; there are intervening gasping sobs of release . The end of the world is at hand . It has a motion of its own ! The sticks have a gravity of their own ! " Do n't cry , little Joannie . Daddy 's here . He 'll take care of you . There 's nothing the matter . What hurt you ? " He does not realize that he is the monster of the deep . Little Joan will be happy forever and never frustrated again , to hold her breath with rage at the crosses of the world ; because the fact is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion , a will , a power of their own . She can play with this power , against this power . These playmates do not tire . This is hilarious . She is sobbing bitterly and quietly . Meantime the ocean is pounding down his tons and tons . There is never a moment of silence . The hissing and shrieking is the collision of the ebb and flow , leaps up . The lacy sheets of surface stream on the mountains of swell , and a dogfish is looking out through the curtains .  | 2 . MYNHEER 'S VALEDICTORY TO MAN Piet Duyck Colijn &; Duyvendak van der Meer comes from among the dunes . Sand in his hair , in his eyelashes , mixed with the saliva on his chin , as if he had been sleeping there . Not possessed enough of himself to brush himself clean . The tears of sorrow are streaming down his dirty cheeks ; his intellectual countenance is opened with grief . He has seen a vision , or dreamed it ; it is no longer sure to him what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is crying , little Joan hushes herself in awe and curiosity . Her father does not set her down ; though astonished he says nothing , but he lays his right arm round Piet Duyck 's shoulders . It is new to him to see such sorrow , and he can not think what could bring this man to this dismay . Duyck neither rejects the friendly embrace nor smiles wanly acknowledging it , nor again redoubles his grief , nor is comforted any ; but his mature tears flow on ; still , he is not shaken by orgastic sobs , but as if another thought brings new tears , and there is always another thought . " I wo n't ask you what 's the matter , friend , " says Harry Tyler , " because I know you and I know it is badly the matter if Piet Duyck is crying ; worse than I or you can cope with . So you 'll have to go on crying till there 's no more . No help for it . But please , allow me , let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your hair . Close your eyes . " Mynheer closes his eyes , and the sailor performs this office for him , of wiping his face and brushing off his clothes . The child , still on her father 's left arm , looks on solemnly . His eyes shut , Mynheer sees nothing but the darkness . Owai ! But it was from just such total eclipse that the bad vision first rose in view . Facing eastward over the ocean , the beginning of May , in the first hours after midnight , when the high spirits have sunk to their lowest , he opened his eyes and expected to see again Pegasus bounding from the horizon as he does in that place at that hour of that night . The dunes lurked in their darkness , as usual . The long comber shone in a few points of starshine . At hand the point of a blade of dune grass drew an accurate circle in the sand . In the soft breeze . The constellation that arose , that began to arise , was not the winged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , not seen before . It was Man . The constellation Man appeared on the horizon , and slowly as the hour passed reared to his full height. * * So Parker saw it .  | Mynheer 's jaw hung down and he looked there with startling eyes ; and when the stars were all displayed ( only a few ) he began to weep and could not stop . For what is raised as a constellation of stars into the macrocosm is something that will not change ( such as it is ) . What is in the stars is no more on earth . It is the immortal death in the soul we project in abstractions that imitate , by their abstractness , the nonexistence of that which is . Then good-by . Good-by to the race of animals that invented half a dozen ways of making fire ; and by flags and flashing mirrors , smoke and radio waves signaled across vast distances . Who accumulated the records of their litigation in volumes of the Common Law . Good-by . Good-by to the kind that proved again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with heart , subtiler than swords , breathing also courage and ambiguous with anguish : who would have thought it was possible if Man did not prove it so in act ? Good-by to dancers , used to dance , lightly imitating the inward in outward motions of the limbs and recreating the world in double and triple time . Good-by to one certain gloomy beast who carved the unfinished in rocks . For if it is the valedictory of Man that flows and leaps in his mind , there is matter for Mynheer to weep for a long time , well into the dawn , and after that  --  as now he thinks of kinds and classes of men and now of this man or that man . Good-by to those who used to cut and polish little stones for prismatic lights , and measure the rainbows . To those others who by addition combined small pieces of iron and stone into immense bridges and towers . Good-by to the kinds of men characterized by city names , Florentines , Ninevites , New Yorkers . Good-by to the inventors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their busy wits . Good-by to intrepid sailors led on and on when they were afraid : it is not the case that one would have expected this until the Man proved it in act . Good-by to those who suggested to themselves to be disgusted with such and such good meat , and those who used to make boundaries and cower on one side of the boundary they themselves made . Also , good-by to the poet of Man f red . ? Do not misunderstand ; it is not I who am weeping or pretending to weep , for I am rather filled with hate and resentment of men . But Mynheer , the intellect , is weeping at every thought . And he can not dam such a flood of tears by nice distinctions of good and bad , sensible or senseless  --  rather that this race of animals was so , this was how it was . He will not exhaust his mournful thoughts , for almost everything one thinks of is Man , of Man , by Man , etc . Even so the indefinite series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the macrocosm . Good-by to the famous pairs and triangles of lovers and the soli- p 300 tary unloved lovers ; and to the lovers and loveless nameless , that one used to pass by in parks  --  these all transforming lust in ways that one would not have counted on . Good-by to those sage or mad in peculiarly human ways . Also to those specifically malevolent and destructive , torturers and self-tortured , as only this race was able : and now afterward the thought of them is shining lovely enough . ( But it was not by signal malevolence that Man ceased to exist . Well ! Good-by also to the stupid ones characteristically human , who used not to know enough to come in out of the rain . ) Good-by to the knightly heroes . Good-by to the Master of the Way , who lay seventy years in the womb in order to show what it was to be full-formed a Man before submitting to the accidents of the world . This had a nature , like any other animal race ; but it was not easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized , in history , in its acts : that it could harmonize three or four voices musicianly ( the child 's voice leading the melos ) , and grapple ships in a naval war . Good-by to the ignorant armies that clashed by night on the plain . To the human young that used to have for a few years such astonishing curiosity . And to the eccentric ones with punch-drunk eyes , like trumpeters of the Salvation Army . The race that wore a variety of hats . Good-by to Jean and Franz and Paul Klee : it is not from some other seed of life the like will be produced ( improbable enough as it was ) . Good-by who rode horses as part of their bodies like Centaurs , and drove cars as if they were born shod with metal wheels . Human reader ! It 's not I who am pretending to weep ( rather I 'm hateful and resentful ) ; but it 's Mynheer who is mourning the thought of every formative spirit that made him a man , such as it is : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell it over ; if man ceased to be . Good-by ! Good-by to gamblers who risked fortune on the turn of a card . Good-by to ballplayers . Good-by to devoted women who tried to make sorrowful men happy , and also to the Philistine who robbed her husband of his strength . For when such a flood of tears is once let loose , one does not make nice distinctions of good and bad , friendly and hateful , clever and stupid ; but it is all one race that is lost ; it was so ; that was how it was . Good-by . The thought of this kind and that kind , of this man and that man , occurs to him and makes Mynheer 's tears flow ; and it seems that he will never be able to stop crying over the lapse and ending of Man ( that we others , full of hatred and resentment , think of lightly enough ; but do you picture what it means , and tell it over , the End of Man ? ) .  | It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the soul as an abstraction that imitates , by its abstractness , the nonexistence of that which is . And there he is , rising , a constellation in the Great Cosmos . 3 . Nevertheless , when Harry Tyler has performed for him the office of wiping his sand-caked face and brushing off his clothes , Piet Duyck stops crying . He says in an iron voice , but low not loud , " These people are demented . This is the plainest , broadest evidence . Any discussion of society that fails to keep this important probability in the center is simply stupid . " " Is this news ? Is this what you were crying about ? " " This ? Not at all . I can talk about this without crying a drop , just hardening my voice and keep it low . " " What would happen if you spoke louder ? I can hardly hear you . " " Louder ? " He says it louder , experimentally . " I fly into a rage . " " Is that bad , Piet Duyck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak up about changing something , changing economic institutions , reforming morals , or laying down weapons ; they do not understand that they are talking to people who are demented . This proves that they themselves are demented . Stupid . " " You have n't had breakfast . " " Look here , " says the Dutchman in a rasping voice . " An animal that does not move directly toward its chief desires  --  safety , sexual pleasure , exploration  --  is demented . ( I 'm not hungry , I 'll eat after a while . ) Suppose there are obstacles : then they do not move as directly as possible to circumvent or destroy the obstacles . This is to be simply demented . In fact , long ago they have forgotten what their chief desires are ; and they construct and encourage and submit to obstacles in order to distract themselves from remembering what their desires are . Then here comes some fool and proves to them , by the plainest demonstration from the most obvious evidence , that they are acting against their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are quite demented . Obviously he is demented . " His voice is like an iron file . " Was it always like this ? " " There was always a disposition to it , or it could not have come to be as it has . But it 's recently that this rational social animal has rapidly degenerated to the present ludicrous exhibition of itself . It 's a joke . Ha , ha ! "  | The child looks at him in hatred , for he is not pleasant when he laughs . " The pathology has had three , four , five stages , worse and worse , quicker and quicker . " And on his fingers , Mynheer is ticking off the modern Degeneration of Mankind . " First , the man was frustrated in simple animal desires , kept in bounds and corporally punished ; he became sick with fixation on certain childish pleasures and gluttony and believing various superstitions . The luxuries , vanities and fables of courts and churches . The philosophers of that time saw how it was and they prescribed pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to humanity . I am thinking of Kant and Rousseau . " But as he thinks of these names , Mynheer begins to weep again . " What is the second stage ? " " The man did not follow the easy prescription ! ( This proves that the philosophers were stupid and missed the point . ) The disease went underground and got worse . Next we find the man in the throes of rebelliousness , rebelling against oppressive institutions ; the simple feelings already forgotten . Then the good philosophers prescribed brotherly union against the irrational authorities : 1848 . " But as he thinks of this human year , a great flood of tears drowns Mynheer 's eyes , and he sees the sea and sand and brilliant stars . " Aach ! The man disregarded this prescription too ! No use to think of it . When we look at him again , three or four generations later , he 's a strange one : docile , hard-working at mechanical tasks , hopeful in the progress of a higher standard of living , and really quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astounding time ; it was the time that formed my own childhood . And do you know what the philosophers of that time prescribed to win him back to humanity ? True sciences ! Technical training in the arts ? to make the forlorn creature be again a little at home in the world , I guess . " He does not weep , but only heaves a sigh as he thinks of the ninth edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica . " Even this ludicrous prescription was disregarded . And now it is too late , we have to do with a full-grown neurotic , alienated from both himself and the world ; no love , anger or curiosity . A good citizen , obsessively orderly , a union member , a willingly conscripted soldier . What he wants , where he is , what he is doing there  --  all this is hopelessly forgotten . There is nothing for it ( and this is what the good doctors prescribe ) but to analyze his dreams , to talk about leaping shadows , to try to surprise a little vitality where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , who does not believe in the existence of that which indeed exists  --  namely ,  | his body , his desires , his friends and his enemies  --  he has come to believe in the existence of things that do not exist , for instance benevolent Agencies with names , and democratic Ways , and undemocratic Ways . " It may be hard to credit , but even these human things wring a tear from Mynheer 's intellectual heart . " All right ! " he cries , and he lets his voice rise a little louder . " They are disregarding the psychoanalytic prescription too . What 's next ? For it 's impossible to trace such a series of pathology without prognosis of the next stage . I 'll tell you what . Fully developed catatonic rigidity ! Maniac fits ! Hallucinations ! ( Yes , I just had an hallucination , and now I 'm becoming angry . ) How is this maniac to be handled ? He must be handled ( with care ) with shock treatments . Good , good ! Now it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get their shock . Urged on by a dumb instinct of life that they do not feel , they 'll hit on the right therapy  --  alas , unskillfully . " And the constellation Man will rise in the heavens , above the horizon , at two in the morning , at the beginning of May  --  when the spirits have been highest and have sunk their worst ebb . So . So . " He is flying into a speechless rage . Will he take off ? Having ticked off all five fingers , he is wildly shaking his fist . 4 . But the child , who has sharp eyes , will see an exciting sight and , jumping down from Harry 's arm , dance excitedly down toward the shore pointing skyward . " Look there ! " She 'll be the first to notice them . Coming as two dark spots in the far blue . Gulls ? Rapidly nearer , in good order , abreast ; looming big as a man 's hands . Droyt and Lefty . Now when they see from the excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they have been recognized , the two lads wo n't descend at once . They 'll show off . Staying aloft in the blue , lightly touching their fingertips , they 'll dance the aerial dance that means nothing at all . Caracoling  - -  As the atonal music floats free in the tonal space , returning only to its own figures , this dance moves in the six directions , not ordered to falling or keeping from falling . Since they are showing off they are ordered to the audience in front , but they soon forget this and dance freely ordered only to each other . They join hands and will mount .  | Suddenly Lefty 's hat , ornamented with paper clips , comically drops through space ; but he 'll be down after it and fish it out of the waves . " Careful , you damned fool ! " Mynheer will mutter in his fatherly heart ; they can levitate but they can also break their fool necks . But now laughing they 'll be wheeling in a great circle tumbling clumsily along like clods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . The Right Hand and the Left Hand in the near sky-ground touching their finger tips . These beautiful brothers alike and different . Nothing is so skillful as young lads who have learned a new way of skating and are inspired to show off . Two more beautiful than one , for they rely on and are proud of each other . Such performances are so fair that they hurt one 's heart . What does it mean , will it mean , the aerial dance of Droyt and Lefty over the waves ? Nothing , nothing , nothing , nothing . It is the exuberant decoration , the happy art . Will mean nothing , nothing at all . Simply that there is a new heaven and a new earth . What will be the use of attaching a meaning ? We attach meanings only when we are faced with hard problems and nothing more practical occurs to us . The small child understands the meaning of it very well . She is rolling on the sand , beside herself . The comber is curling from end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing to a fearful height . Lefty will defer to his more daring brother , fall back , call attention to the feat . Oh  --  the big lad has cast off his power to soar ; he is diving ! He hits the water with a noise like the crack of a rifle . He 'll be all right , swimming slowly ashore , now dragging himself through the breakers , while Lefty stays close above him . They touch land at the same moment . Curious company we keep on the beach . The Loch Ness monster and the child who has seen the Loch Ness monster , and the man who saw the constellation Man rise above the horizon . Etc. , etc . This is how it is with us . The two will tell Mynheer the news , how some of the friends can levitate ( they 'll call it simply " flying " ) . He 'll question them closely enough : who ? where ? since when ? under what circumstances ? But he 'll say in the end , " Well , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I 'm not the type , a little heavy . Show me once , hey ? " " Like this ! " cries Lefty , and he 'll rise six feet in the air , smiling , as only he can smile softly . " You do it from about here . " " Ah , so . " The fact is that Mynheer can do anything , anything at all ; and no doubt that he will also be able to levitate .  | Chapter 4 A COMMUNITY OF HUMAN RELATIONS " You see a guy is going to cut your throat , you keep out of his way . That 's right . " " Naa ! You cut his throat before he cuts yours . " - WEST 38TH ST . PIER The intention of the building-sacrifice was to create spirits , to make a beginning . - RANK ( after Kleinpaul ) 1 . Lothair and Emilia were now man and wife , but they were not blessed with children , whether she was barren or he impotent or that together they could not generate a child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were physically , psychologically , socially and metaphysically incapable . They were physically incapable because they did not copulate . And inasmuch as they wanted above all things to have a child , a child to endure for them as they staggered toward their deaths in the storm of hours thick and fast , they were saddened not to apply themselves . Untwining themselves from the entwined wreath of praise . But Emily was emotionally barren because of the living horror in her of the moment when the tiger slew her child and she cried out ; this horror indignantly rejected the seed of the maniac who had let the beast out of the cage ( nor would it have accepted any other man 's ) . And Lothair was emotionally impotent , for he imperially wished to lift by himself the whole city , as we saw , the table and the floor attached to the table , and the walls , and the house ; but by willing it he could not make the flesh of his own penis rise . It was not interesting for a child to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the birth of a child , any especial enthusiasm or hope , or even fear or surprise , that here was something new , a further possibility in the continuity of humanity . It was not interesting for a child to be born then because our ways were well miscalculated to  | prevent his being a hero . It was possible for quite serious persons to ask themselves , " What for ? Is it convenient or inconvenient to have a child ? Is it useful for the child ? Does society need another child ? " These were not very daring questions ; one answer or another , to have a child was not a daring deed ; but without daring there is nothing interesting . So they were sociologically incapable . Emily and Lothair were sad and horrified and holding on too tight and bored . Yet even so we know , as Franz said , that an operation of nature could get them past insoluble dilemmas . But it was metaphysically impossible for them to have a child ( this follows simply from the fact that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital principle were tired , had withdrawn  --  from our animal species that did not know how to care for itself . Perhaps men had , by secondary evasions and tertiary satisfactions and quaternary elaborations that were neither defensive nor satisfactory but nothing at all , men had so cut themselves off from nature and natural conventions that they could no longer draw on natural energy to recreate themselves  --  as if to say , " Man ceased to be human around 1870 , or some other date . " But then a new child would be born strange into a nonexistent species ; no such child could get itself born . We were metaphysically childless , as if now the energy of our generation were concentrated in the one action of immortality , the imitation of our nonexistence , to become ( as Parker saw it ) a constellation in the sphere . As if to say , I hunted it , and I have eaten it ( now let me sleep ) . Ach , what I ate was how it lay there dead : this virtue has passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of them turns you to stone , even if they sit there crying tears . 2 . But Mynheer flew there with his bright mirror like Perseus . He said , " I do not know exactly , though I could make several shrewd guesses , why couples are childless ; but at the least we can get some help from the elementary statistics . Since more children are born in the country , you two ought to move to the country . Also you ought to have a human community where you and this child can directly satisfy , to a degree , the various rather few simple wants of human nature . This is obvious . " " There is no such human community , " said Lothair . " No , there is not ; but we can invent that , " said Mynheer.  | " What ! Again ? " cried Lothair unbelievingly , for he himself used to be a greedy inventor of Utopian places in order to divert himself from the fact that his teeth were aching . " Why not again ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sensibly as you can manage ? But let 's not get complicated . First , do you two have sexual intercourse ? " " No , " said Emily . " Ah , you see ? We hit on something right off . It 's necessary to fuck if you want to have children . " 3 . " Easy to say ! I also have heard of this newsy hypothesis ! " said Lothair bitterly . " But her flesh shrinks in horror , and mine is clamped in a death grip , trembling . Trembling and does not loose  --  you see how it is ! " He held out his mighty hand  --  that was not , however , trembling , so far as one could see . These were fantasies of his . Then Duyck looked directly in the faces of these two gorgons and his heart turned to heavy stone within him . He faltered . " What 's the matter  --  are you ill ? " they cried solicitously . " It 's nothing . This  --  " He took out his heart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A cornerstone for building a good city . " 4 . It does n't exist but we can invent that : so Mynheer used to say readily ( I have known such persons ) . Without despairing , or else despairing , he still used to assign to the intellect the role of knowing reasons and making something by means of the reasons . He did not merely notice with alarm , as we others learned to do in the middle of the twentieth century , writing up these notices for literary magazines . But he went to work . The folk had become demented : this did not paralyze him , though it had to be taken into account . " Oh , reasons are as plentiful as blackberries , " said the poet , meaning excuses , rationalizations . Good reasons are not so plentiful as that , but they are not rare ; they are perhaps as plentiful as apples on poor trees ( some trees have none , in poor seasons , and the seasons have been poorly ) . It was not even the case that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were unsuccessful . And now , turning over in his mind the thought of a Community of Human Relations to provide for the formation of a child 's personality  --  and sometimes absently hefting the heavy stone that fitted  | the palm of the hand , as if he were about to let it fly as a missile ? he rapidly jotted down some notes on the back of a marriage-license : We need , he figured , " 1 nursing mother : matrix of affection and elementary satisfaction . 1 rival bad-mother ( aunt type ) , for the attachment of rage and nausea. 1 rival good-mother ( big-sister type ) , desire without tangible satisfaction . 1 neutral older woman , to bridge the gap to apathy . 3 or 4 fathers ( uncle type ) : manly identification , threats of maiming ; gain of security by learning to play off one against another . ( Teacher , policeman , mother 's mate , mother 's lover. ) 1 older brother : the model to be avoided . 1 younger brother , the favorite ( Abel type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual friend : projection of narcissism. 1 male nonsexual friend : the rival . 1 other friend , either sex : object of selfless devotion . 2 or 3 other males , roughly contemporary : the gang . 1 outsider : the scapegoat . 1 older girl friend , sexually active , to force him to overcome the Oedipus situation . 1 younger girl friend , for fearless exploration , for playing the father role . 1 maniac , all is not what seems . 1 old person , dying . 1 stranger to the society : infinity of mystery . Total 22 persons " So many ! Mynheer whistled with surprise ; even so far it came to more than twenty persons to ensure the development of a personality . Besides , there would have to be a few animals , to establish the continuity of the species . And an Angel ? Also , the social engineer had to provide a Factor of Safety , for it was unlikely that every person would enter into every needful relation . At first Mynheer considered a large factor , 5 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have 3 , for when confronted with any three , the comparative soul always sees one to favor and one to disfavor and one to seek as an ally . Also , it tended to limit the size of the factor that each person was likely to play several roles : the mate is the interloper , the scapegoat is the object of selfless de-  | votion , etc . Mynheer therefore chose a factor of 3 and he decided that the Community required : 22 X 3 = 66 persons . " It is a suburban community , " he concluded , " weighted heavily toward the children and boys and girls . " 5 . Our friends ( 1948 ) were hungry and thirsty and lonely to live in a community of human relations . They were lost , lonely , and out of touch in the community in which indeed they did live ; it was no community , for them or anyone else , because in it one did not flow in the elementary human relations . Leaving it  --  with a burst of joy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty of being out of touch with one another in elementary human relations . Nevertheless , there was an advantage in leaving the lonesome community that indeed existed to flock to the invented community that did not exist , in which also they would not flow in the elementary human relations : because in the new community they could reveal their naked hatred . They chose a pleasant place , provided with the four elements , earth , air , water and fire. * The air in this place was a flexible medium somewhat infiltrating into their animal bodies and furnishing no strong obstacle to motion through itself . A certain number of the settlers were able to feel the ambience of this air , as in and out it rushed and lay about them as they moved . The earth here was well connected with the center : it gave adequate support to standing and walking and even running , by offering an equal and opposite reaction to the pressure exerted on it . But there were few of the settlers who could feel their legs planted on this bedrock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remarkable virtue of fluidity ; it broke into drops and reunited in a flowing body , and as if effortlessly it flattened itself in level pools wherever there was a depression . Yes ! There was a high rushing foaming fall of water that fell in an instant still in a flat unrevealing pool reflecting the blue heavens and the clouds . And lastly there was the dark fire that burst into visibility whenever it struck something not transparent , as their faces . * Since we come again to a physical plan , I must explain how it was that Mynheer 's wife Laura was not present and in charge of these arrangements . To put it bluntly , she had gone crazy and would not leave the house . She suffered from a socio-psychological complaint whose salient symptom Kenneth Burke was , I think , the first to identify : she imagined that she was the personality expressed in the pictographs : the 1/3 of a housewife who rides on of a bicycle wearing 1 ? shoes , and so forth . This made it difficult for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these kinds of matter , certain vegetation of weeds and flowers found nourishment , and animals too could subsist there . Perhaps a human community could here appoint itself . Perhaps ? Alas , there was no proof ! There was no demonstrative proof that a particular commonwealth must appoint itself , just here , just itself , namely a human community , a community of human relations , one with mothers and brothers and friends and rivals , and the known and the unknown . Why this particular thing , in a world generally provided with air , earth , water , and fire ? Why must it appoint itself into existence ; how was it justified to , how would it venture to ? Yet if it did not appoint itself , who would appoint it ? Yet it was impossible to live not in some human community in just such a place provided with earth , air , etc . Either it was necessary to appoint oneself ( one felt no such necessity ) , or it was impossible to live at all . It was a dilemma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is of course always difficult to conclude to a particular , to bring it into existence ; nevertheless , this always occurs , as if " by an operation of nature , " proved from the beginning of time  --  as it seemed that the human community had also existed . But now we asked in our misery , how is this justified ? And if one asked , what kind of answer did one expect ? Obviously it was impossible . The prospective settlers would willingly have fled in every direction , back to the human community they had left . But to what community ? No such thing any longer existed ; they had left it with a burst of joy . Harry Tyler , who had a collection of jokes for all occasions , told them the joke about the three displaced persons . " Where are you bound ? " one asked another . " I think I 'll go to London . And you ? " " I intend to go to Paris .... And where are you going ? " they asked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa ! " " To South Africa ! So far ? " " So far from  --  where ? " 6 . But Mynheer said  --  for he was learned and could recall old stories and rites for emergencies , something to tell oneself and to perform in order that life may meantime begin to flow again  --  he said : " We must sacrifice a life to the beginning of our community , as Remus was slain by his brother in order that Rome might have a beginning . If a life is given , the city will begin of itself : that is , we shall have a spirit . We shall not need to justify our city  --  the dead man justifies it ; the city lives and what is living justifies itself . The only question is this : which one must be slain and plowed into the field ? "  | The question was met by silence and no lively enthusiasm . Lothair , Emilia , Harry Tyler and the others measured the speaker with their eyes , and measured one another . Feeling himself the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hefted the black stone that fitted the palm . He held the stone out to them to see and said , " This is my heart turned to stone : the heart of understanding when it looked full at such and such feelings in the world , instead of looking glancingly , like Perseus , in a mirror . I propose now to hurl this as a missile , and we can bury the crushed skull in the field as the sacrifice for our city . Whose ? " He raised his forearm , and they cried out and fell back . Droyt Duyvendak did not fall back , but he asked his father angrily , " Why are you exempted ? Ask anyone here whether you are not the most likely candidate ! " The youth was in an ugly mood that reflected the mood of the crowd , and they advanced a little on Mynheer . But the tears flooded Horatio 's eyes and he said in a choked voice : " Ow ! In the days of the Grand Piano they slew my only friend , Raymond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war my chosen father and Arthur died ; and now because of this cursed community , that I for one shall be no brother in  --  for I can not rid myself of the void roundabout me as I go , the presence of their absence  --  for this am I also to lose Piet Duyck , the subtilest and one of the best ? I 'm not yet at the point to say , Let me die rather ! ' But from this moment on I do not intend to stop wailing . " And he began to wail in an eerie way . It was worse than anything . Craftily and winningly , Minetta Tyler said , " I think you all look at this proposed sacrifice too one-sidedly ; you think it 's so bad to be the one chosen , and expend your pity and fear on him . I for my part consider that role with equanimity . Bang ! I 'm dead  --  and what about afterwards ? Ha ! Now I 'm permanently under that city , or built into that wall ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of me now . Wo n't I haunt that city of yours ? Do n't worry ; I 'm not thinking of anything vindictive , obviously we love one another dearly or what are we doing here together ? But a spirit has to play little tricks , exert an influence .... " People laughed , baring their teeth . 7 . " Well , I did n't go to South Africa after all ! " This was a large redhead unknown to anybody , who kept circulating and annoying people . Often new faces turned up at our meeting , sometimes they became old faces , sometimes one never saw them again . The oddity of this fellow was that he refused to tell his name or say whose friend  | he was . He said he was the third displaced person in the joke and had decided not to go to South Africa but to go to a community with human relations . " To a community ! So far ? " " So far from where ? " He was a humorist ; one soon recognized his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had come in order to fill the community role of the Stranger , the one whose presence opens the mind of the growing boy to the fact that the world is infinite . He was practicing the part , he explained ; he had ideas for it . " For instance , I have to change costumes ; otherwise the kids get used to me and I 'm not the same thing . But every couple of days I put on a different mask . See ? I 'm willing to work hard at being the Stranger ; it fits me . " In fact he had brought a mask with him and slipped it on ; his red hair showed , he was not concealed at all . He was grotesque . " I 'm not a Jew ! " he protested  --  he seemed to be an Irishman . " The Jew is the outsider , the Scapegoat , but I 'm the Stranger , see ? " He had another routine that was so complicated that one could not resist a wintry smile . " Sixty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what that means ? " Nobody knew . " Look , twenty-two ? " he held up two fingers on each hand and then clasped the two 2 's together ? " that means a buddy-fuck , two buddies with two girls . Thirty-three ? " he held up three fingers on each hand and clasped the 3 's together ? " that 's a gang-shag . Fifty-five ! There 's a lovely number . Body and soul . I give you my heart and my hand , that 's true marriage . " He clasped his hands in an agony of sentiment . " Now if you hold up six fingers on each hand and bring them together , then you have a real community . A community of human relations . Ha , try it sometime . " By evening , however , when the thinner light revealed things more coolly in their places , this same merry-andrew began to seem sinister . He had been drinking a good deal . " You lousy communityseekers ! " he hissed , in the otherwise quiet , " you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pell-mell on top of one another . As if you did that in order to live in a community of human relations . . . . Why did I come here , among these chicken-shit community-seekers ? Do I love you , you particular , you particle , you biped . Ha ! They all have two feet  --  what 's that to me ? " " Nobody invited you . Why do n't you go away ? " " Hell , I 'll go away ! Can you make me ? " He was a competent Stranger ; he had the knack of clinging grimly where he did n't belong . 8 . In the darkness their eyes were narrowed to slits  --  jaw thrust forward . A man turned a flashlight on another , bathing the object of  | hatred in light ; also the startled eyes of the hated could not quite make out what was looming in the darkness . A bell tolled . And they said : " I hate you damned children and mate ; you have imprisoned me and I can not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I shortly die . " I hate myself for a coward to be so imprisoned . " I hate you for the sexual demand you make that I force myself to , to live up to an acceptable standard , and I hate you because you do not satisfy my sexual demand . " I hate you who wake me when I need to sleep ; I hate you who do not take care of everything for me . " I hate you boring friends who do not consult the hour that it suits me to have your company . That hour would never strike ! " I hate you desirable strangers who do not befriend me . " Because much of this is due to my cowardice and stupidity , I hate myself the more and I hate you the more . I have gotten no satisfaction from being reasonable and just , yet I feel guilty for being unreasonable and unjust ; I hate you who make me feel guilty . " You who shatter the quiet of my meals with clamor and temper , so I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my gorge rise to food I do not like . " I hate the dog that shits in the street . " All such I should be content to see blotted from existence . " While the bell was tolling , it was being said : " You successful one ! I should like to turn you upside down and dash your brains on the pavement . " I hate you sufferers who dampen my joy . " I hate you who neglect and do not praise me ; but I will shine in such glory that you wo n't dare to open your traps , though you still wo n't see the point . " I hate you who do not give me money when I need it , who do not guess that I need it when I am too stiff-necked to ask for it . " I despise myself for a beggar . I hate my poor clothes and I hate you who are ashamed of my poor clothes , but worst of all I hate you who overlook me because of my poor clothes . You I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not putting me in the way of something to my advantage ; I hate you for not seeing in what a state of need and frustration I exist ; I hate you for presuming to perceive it . " I hate you who hurt my feelings by breaking the appointment , and you keep me on edge by treating at leisure something urgent to myself . " I hate you fool who cross me in argument and keep on chatter-  | ing after I have got your drift and am ready to reply . ( This deserves grating . ) " I hate you who eat apples loudly . " The bell was fiercely tolling stroke after stroke and it was being said : " You children , I can not breathe when you are around and there is no order ; no doubt I should like you to die of those illnesses that cause me so much anxiety . But even worse I hate you grownups who are cruel to children and beat them . " I hate you who have beat me , and all who are strong enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment from people for past offenses . " I hate you I fear . " I hate myself for hating myself , as if I did not need  --  and merit ? a little sweet consolation . " I hate myself for thinking swarms of thoughts and not breathing the air and taking in the scene . For not giving in easily to such pleasure as is offered . " I hate you who warped my feelings and ruined my happiness ; I hate you whom I see busy about the same with others ; and I hate myself for lacking courage to prevent it . " I hate the order of things that could , it seems , so easily have given me happiness , because my wants are simple . " Many other things were being said in hatred , some peculiarly but most by most . I for my part was also present , in my usual capacity , and I added : " I hate this poetic art , particularly when I consider those works and moments of it that have been my joy and pride , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for me to have been myself , to lead the wretched life that I have led . That I sacrifice to a happiness hardly mine at all  --  for those moments pass as in an apathetic dream , and they recur , as still they recur , to me ever more tired and spent . I have sacrificed to the life of the art what might have been a life of mine , not to speak of consequent poverty , public neglect , spite and envy both taken and given . So much for these poems and for my life ; yet strike me dead if I mean to say any harm of the Creator Spirit . " The bell tolled the stroke of twelve . " ? The Creator Spirit , in whom we find such sense as we do find in a universe that otherwise does not seriously recommend itself . " A BOYISH GAME Meantime , in the cone of light the circle of a dozen boys closed in on Terry , pounding him ; sound of their hitting fists ; and he cried out .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy staggered a moment and gasped . He braced himself and advanced a step with clenched fists , for it was now his turn to choose who would be beat . " Pick Albie ! " cried a boy ( not Albie ) . " Hit Droyt , he 's got it coming . " " No ; Berryman ! " But the boy slowly moved in the circle , narrowing his eyes . Suddenly he hit the largest boy in the face , Droyt . Like a wave the circle opened back from this victim  --  Terry slipped into his position  --  and the circle came forward again , beating Droyt . He was angry and his eyes flashed and he clenched his fists , but he bore the beating without flinching . " Two hands ! " he cried outraged  --  this was unfair , they were supposed to punch with only one hand , " I 'll get even with you , brother . " " I 'm Lefty , " cried Lefty . " Ca n't I use my best hand ? " They withdrew , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albie ! " " No ; Berryman ! " There was one boy whose name nobody mentioned , to be beat . He was neither the largest nor the smallest ; he was not enviably handsome nor able ; or perhaps he might have been enviably so , but he had the vitality to give his attention to each of us . Attentive desire shone quietly from his presence and he was our darling ; yet in the melee he threw his punch as hard as any . " For Chrissake , sock Berryman , he 's got it coming to him ! " " Shut up , you bastard , " said Berryman ; " let him pick who he wants . " Droyt did not move about the circle , but slowly turned his head from side to side , all around to take in all of us narrowing his eyes . It was terrible ; each one had the moment to conjure well with the reason that Droyt had to hate him . Narrowing glance and flinching glance . " Make up your mind . " We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I felt the heavy blow between the eyes , it was as if the abyss had opened without a warning , and I might have fallen down . The interval was long  --  but not endless . The circle of my comrades fell away . What did one understand , standing staggering gasping in the center of the hated  --  the hated but no longer feared ? Bracing oneself . One understood that the game was universal . I do not mean that it was impersonal , that it was not this or that individual that they meant to hurt . On the contrary , how else should the universal cause come into existence except just through personal animosities ,  | given and taken , for reasons peculiar in the history of each individual ? But one understood that it was a universal repetition , and one felt supported by the motions of the world , as one stood in the center with whirling head , coming back to myself . Now it was my turn to choose . " Pick Albie ! " " Sock Droyt again ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with narrowing eyes at the faces that were hateful but not fearful . I was inspired by universal thoughts ; therefore , I easily , guiltlessly , advanced toward that interloper in my security who knew well who he was and cringed before my glance . I hit him , and slipped into his place . The circle closed in on him in fury and , to my joy , he cried out . The boys were tired , all staggering  --  influenced by the jarring motions of the stars . The circle no longer formed itself with neat clarity , the victim was swaying before he was beat . It was a ragged pattern ; all were falling , flinging themselves , into the center . Shining with an internal clarity . Yes ! Now it was a simple thing to pick on precisely our favorite  --  who gave to us his lovely attention . To single him out ! Two or three were being pushed into the center at once . The pounders were being pounded . We could not bear to leave our darling behind , solitary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 . " Please put out those lights and let 's get some sleep , " some one suggested mildly . Mynheer said , " Right ! In my opinion there 's enough hatred felt here to inaugurate community relations . Nothing to found empires on , no spectacular bloodcurdling curses , parricide and blasphemy ? only the conjugal annoyances , maltreatment of children and economic complaints of 1948 ; but enough , enough to cement the human relations . The community of human relations exists . " It existed , for we were falling asleep together , performing the interesting social act of falling asleep together . Some drop off at once , some toss awhile , a few lie awake a longer time , but in the end heavy sleep subdues them nearly all . ( With us , the first to fall asleep was the professional Stranger , snoring in secure confidence . ) Also an occasional voice , a last thought , breaks the silence of falling asleep . Lothair said : " This person who complains against the order of things because it has not granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusion . His wants are speciously simple . Among all  | his unattainable wants he has chosen a few and speciously simplified them and set them up as his program , in order to be angry with more self-righteousness . Hm . Then he says , ' My wants are so simple ; why do n't I get what I want ? ' Hm . " Our community existed fine ; no need to prove it . There was not one of us who did not have fair samples of mothers , father types , teachers , seducers , maniacs , scapegoats , etc. ? everything necessary for the formation of our personalities . With few exceptions our personalities were perfectly , fully formed . Our community was unsatisfactory in  --  shall we say ? ? many ways , but no doubt of it , it was close , tight . Another last thought broke the silence , a sudden laughter , and the pretty dancer Rosalind said : " This artist ! Ha , ha , ha . He speaks of a life sacrificed to the life of the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his life ? What does he know about what it would be ? Is n't it plausible  --  eh ? ? that it would have been something more ghastly ? It 's rich , how people carry on . " " Maybe so , " I began to protest , " but I 'd like to be the arbiter of that ; after all  --  " But she was already asleep . I am one to lie long awake . 10 . Certainly our communal relations were dense enough to allow a man and a woman , Lothair and Emily , to roll together and copulate , and so they did , under their cover . Their rigid grip on their feelings was somewhat loosed by fear of death and the expression of hatred , and they enjoyed themselves , came to a pleasurable orgasm . They wept . And fell asleep . And as happens in a fair proportion of copulations , the semen fertilized the egg and it was a beginning to the forming of a child that would likely be born into the community of human relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved by the actuality ) ? in a place of air , earth , water and fire  --  in the line of the generation of the animals from long ago . From such products , such freeborn heirs of the process of time , we may study the nature of the vital spirit . Now the offspring who was thus engendered was St. Wayward .  | Chapter 5 HORATIO 'S MOURNING-LABOR 1 . On West Street , the avenue nearest the lordly river , a young man who , you would guess , could fly , was squatting abject on the curbstone . Access to the water was cut off by the warehouses , and the trucks were screaming past across his toes . " Abject " : having dismissed himself . He was walking heavily past this spot  --  it was not even a spot on the continuous long avenue until one singled it out  --  and you would not say from his heavy gait that he could fly . Suddenly he turned back to this spot and dropped himself down , squatting , the abjection dropping on him like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the next step further on , that he must be abject . The next instant he slipped from the curbstone and sat in the gutter , not quite dry . The space of this drop was two inches . Through these two inches , from the level of the walk to the level of the street , he dropped in one instant as Vulcan fell all day long from Olympus in a streak of fire . Lamed . The man was Horatio and the tears came into his eyes . He put in his mouth the little finger of his right hand , whose tip was missing ; but the scar was long since healed and he could not understand the language of the beasts . He was not crying . The place was grimy with dust from the coal stations along the river , and Horatio 's denim clothes were made dirty by dirt not belonging to his work . He turned suddenly back from a further step and dropped to his haunches on the curb ; then in an instant slid into the gutter and the tears flooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching to his lips , but not sucking , the missing tip on his little finger ; and the trucks screamed by across his toes . " I give it up  --  one place is like another . " Having dismissed himself : as if to say , " If in order to have become what I have become , it is necessary for me to be what I am , not I will take one further step  --  nor continue to maintain myself  --  " here he slid the few inches into the street , not meaning , of himself , to say anything further . But his workshirt hung loose , it  | opened and fell from his shoulders , and his trousers were open ( though he was not drunken or crying ) , and his body spoke what he did not know he knew . The shapes along there , the coal stations and the warehouses , some burnt out , did not flatter the eyes ; the river was shut off ; the boarded windows of an abandoned hotel for mariners did not invite the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confidence . But you could see , seeing the nakedness of Horatio in flashes amid the tons of trucks screaming by over him  --  as the curtain of reality is rent and in flashes we perceive the Way  --  that he could fly . 2 . Adjusting his clothes , Horatio walked back to his job . It was a gang of three drilling through the subpavement to test the seepage . They chose a spot , chiseled out a cobblestone and dug . The casing was supposed to be twenty feet thick , but when , after hours of pounding , they got down to nineteen , they again and again struck an impenetrable boulder . They moved to another spot to try . Sometimes a fellow walked away from the frustrating business . Another more fortunate gang up the street had struck gas and high flames were pouring from the pipe . The engine groaned and the hammer rang clear and regularly on the rod . When they had gained six feet , Horatio screwed another length on the pipe . The engine coughed and recommenced , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The laden trucks screamed past . Busy little lifts carried boxes from warehouses to trucks . Above the rooves loomed the ship stacks and the coal scoops , swinging from the barges , letting loose their cargoes in a rattling hail . Depending on their characters and conditions the persons moving this apparatus were silent or shouting . There was danger enough for all in the rapid contrary motion of objects weighing many tons . The noise , motion and fear were not quite chaotic , for nearly all the men were capable of stopping short in an emergency  --  the trucks grind to a stop and the coal scoops not let loose their hail ; and also it was possible to assign an obvious reason to any particular motion , though not perhaps to all the motions together . The noise and motion and fear were not chaotic even to the sensibility if one happened to be in a mood of feverish animation ready for any blow . ( But Horatio was withdrawn and turned to each blow after it had struck . ) The hammer rang with an angrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had again struck an impenetrable obstacle . The gang began to curse  | their luck . They shut off the engine . The tugs whistled the end of the working day . A train of cars was dragging slowly by on the overhead railroad , and a shower of sparks fell from a faulty contact . A pretty young woman standing against a pillar of the railroad was watching the drill , or the gang , or Horatio . It was he , and his penis rose adventurously . But he could not enliven his face to a smile . His mates knocked off work at the whistle and walked away to the watchman 's hut to change , leaving him to put the machine and the tools to rest . 3 . In a few moments the neighborhood had emptied and become quiet , leaving Horatio and the power drill on a large open plain ? as if he himself had journeyed to another place  --  as Orpheus traveling through the underworld left behind the agitated damned and advanced to a quiet place to the sound of a flute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching , from the corner of the street that led onto the pier . Methodically , not stolidly ; tired but not disgusted ; carefully , not obsessively ; slow but not dragging  --  the man went about putting away the equipment and cleaning and covering the engine . A number of heavy lengths of pipe were scattered on the ground . He picked up one length at a time and brought it and dropped it with a clang onto a stack of pipes alongside the engine . By straining a little , he might have carried two lengths at once , or again tossed the pipe rather than carried it ; but he slowly brought each length and dropped it with a clang ; yet not stupidly nor stolidly  --  each length was heavy enough  --  rather as if he were conserving his forces by method . He picked up a pair of heavy crowbars , one in each hand , and lightly tossed them clanging onto the stack . He took a wrench from the box and unscrewed the hose from the hydrant ; he drank from the hydrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning against the hydrant as if absentmindedly . ( But it was by forethought . ) He dragged the long hose toward the engine , and snapping the kinks out of it with a sure hand , he folded it in a coil on the ground , alongside the engine . Already the operations that had littered a wide area were confined to a surprisingly small center . He was proceeding from the outside in , but freely , not pedantically . He himself moved slowly , but the effects were surprisingly rapid . Any workman putting away his tools is among the lovely dancers  | of the world . In this movement the soul is sent to pasture . The workman is tired , the task is recreative , and he handles his tools with respectful love and care . And perhaps the movement is especially lovely when the soul is in distress and during it the breathing becomes more calm . Deliberate but not controlled . It is as if one were constructing again and again the following syllogism , gaining force each time from the conclusion : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; now I am making a little effort ; therefore I am not completely unready . " A few at a time he tossed the dozens of small objects that had been left on the pavement , nuts , washers and bar wrenches , into the box . Gathering the greater tools , he brought them to the box and hung them in place on hooks provided . " Accepting a total loss , one finds oneself suddenly making a little effort . I have accepted , etc. ; therefore , now I am making a little effort . But those who make a little effort are not completely unready . Accepting a total loss , I am not completely unready . .. . No one of his own doing accepts a total loss ! It is by grace ! " From deep in the box he fetched a gallon can of oil , a rag and a copper oiler . He poured a pint of oil into the engine  --  the operations were now circumscribed to the engine itself . He polished the points , but he was not scrupulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no use in making the parts better than the whole . He put a drop of oil on the fan shaft . Unwinding a length of rope from the drill frame and lifting the bulky coil of hose from the ground , he securely bound the hose to the body of the engine , so it would not be an attractive loose object for the wandering boys at night . It made no difference if they played with the stack of pipes . He pulled the rope taut , but he fastened it with loose hitches ; secure , not permanent . Absently he carried back the oil and the rag and stowed them into the depths of the box . From another corner the young woman was still watching him . Invitingly , and obligingly , he stripped off his work shirt a moment before he would have otherwise . She paled with interest and he was able to grin . " No one of his own doing accepts a total loss ! It is by grace ! I accept it  --  not of my own doing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find myself making a little effort , it is not of my own doing that I am making a little effort . And if it is making a little effort that keeps me from being completely unready , it is not by my own doing that I am not completely unready . Yes , in fact ! For by my own doing I have been turning to each blow after it has struck . " In one motion he brought forth a great tarpaulin and unfolded it , and with a large arm he covered all the engine in darkness . In  | the twinkling of an eye the world was transformed . Nothing nothing nothing  --  all the wide operations were reduced to this mysterious shape on the empty plain . The man himself shrank away to a small inch beside the veiled shape . His tiny figure cast a long pencil of shadow in the red sunlight . ( The pretty girl had gone away . ) Whatever was the meaning of the wide operations , it was not the economy that these men thought of ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the looming tarpaulin . The tiny half-naked man went to the hydrant and washed himself . He noticed that the woman was gone , but he assumed that she , like a being of reason and desire , was waiting for him on the pier . Turning the water off , he brought the wrench back to the box and locked the box and , trailing his shirt along the ground , he went to the watchman 's hut to change his clothes . 4 . The unknown woman was not waiting for him on the pier . Horatio reddened with vexation . He came away not pausing to look out on the broad river furrowed by tugboats . She had been promising to him just because she was a stranger ; as if it were only by surprise that one had any pleasure . As if  --  what is perhaps the case , I no longer remember it  --  one had to give in to knowing love by a series of deliberate choices and Horatio could not make the choices . His disappointed eyes burned hot and dry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved friends . There was a time that , conversing with his dead friends , he had an open look and wore a participatory smile ; but he did not remember them any more . He could not open his tight eyelids wide . He did not feel the unfelt pain , but he did not smile . Horatio was sick . It is shameful to present to the reader an image of sickness and unfelt pain . ( I am ashamed myself to exist this way in the world . ) It is worse to have to describe Horatio so , my hope and beauty , fearless attentiveness . Always leaving the unsurprising community of his living friends , Horatio found himself habitually alone , wooing his unfelt pain in order to feel it . Then if suddenly he came upon his living friends , who were seeking some kind of community with one another , they fell dead , because he was a wizard out of hell ; he judged them and they could not abide his judgment . He found himself alone because he was ashamed to exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , he was ashamed to open his eyes and see something that was the case . He was ashamed to erect his penis and reach his lips toward something desirable . He was ashamed to recall a thing to memory . To walk by pushing against the ground . To draw breath in and let it out , without controlling the upper and nether limits . He was ashamed to say what was correct and destroy the community of human relations . He was ashamed to say what was humorous and amiably establish the community of human relations . Yet being alone , without even the conversation of the dead , there was nothing to see , erect the penis toward , etc. , and no way to say something humorous . He gnawed the stump of his finger . The pigeons on the avenue scattered before his approach . When he was hiding in the cloak of withdrawn touch , he could feel his hot and lively pain . His character was the history of the losses of loved friends . The agreed losses ; one appoints oneself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to dismiss himself . Too late ! Was it too late ? ( Perhaps there was a previous loss that he had never agreed to . ) Without a quick frank glance in any direction , he was walking blindly along like a fool . Then his fearlessly attentive eyes became burning hot ; he could understand , blindly , what those eyes of his were about . They were hungry and devouring , murderous and ravenous . Standing still , squeezing his lids tight shut , now he could see the scene ; that there were rocks , trees , and grass , and the sun rising at a bound , and a few animals , and familiar and unfamiliar people , and their buildings and vehicles , the broad river furrowed by tugboats , the faces of his brother and sister : a good sample of the world , all objects of ravenous vision . He was ashamed to open his eyes and see what was the case . He was suffering the tearing pain of the organs of his body reaching in different directions . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to cry . But he was grieving , indeed uttering a little whine , for the loss of his own magic powers . If he had indeed ever had magic powers , for he no longer remembered what that was like . ( But he did not really doubt that he had had magic powers . ) If he had indeed lost them , for since he did not exert his powers at all he did not know whether or not they would prove magical , efficacious . ( He did not really believe that he had lost his magic powers ; but he believed that he did not exert them . ) He was grieving not with the useful grief of boiling tears , but by suffering tearing pain , possibly only in order  | to feel the pain ; but one does not choose how he will grieve . Standing still , eyes squeezed shut , nape tight , lips drawn back from his opened teeth , etc. , he was recognizable as a man choosing to go on suffering tearing pain : that is , grieving for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss . I am distressed to present to the reader this image . Horatio opened his eyes and saw to his delight that the same pretty young woman was ahead of him , walking up Jane Street , and even turning her head to smile at him . His heart bounding with surprise , he crossed the street after her . She turned into a doorway and so did he . 5 . Following the strange woman , whose name was Rosalind , into the house on Jane Street , Horace fell among his friends at a party . This was not surprising since he had been unthinkingly heading toward this gathering ; nor was Rosalind a stranger , for he had often met her at other meetings , and seeing him at work she had courteously waited for him . Our friends were celebrating the cheerful recent events , the first in a long time : that some people could levitate , that they were established in a new community , that Lothair and Emily were going to have a child . Besides , people had brought their dogs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead from Berlin . There was dancing , but when a pair of dogs began to dance in the middle of the floor , in nimble stiff-legged postures , or planting their forepaws on the floor and barking , the human dancers paused and regarded this mobile statuary with admiration . A golden spirit of ease and joy had sunk down on this party , that from that hour they were likely to be happy . Yet as on a dazzling hazy midsummer afternoon , when the insects are loud on the flowers and one is blinded with daylight , nevertheless , to one 's astonishment , it becomes still louder and brighter when the sun himself glides into the blue , liquid as a tear  --  so the cheer of the party became miraculous when Horatio walked in . The dogs barked frantically , and it was possible to understand the simple thing that they were saying . It was possible for the lover to wish well to the beloved . And the minutes , as it says in The Emperor of China , " the minutes were flying like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Horatio radiated ability , that called forth our gaiety . What is poetry ? The motion of the soul from thought to thought ( this is  | Feeling ) ; rhythms in the motion ( the pleasure of the body in the Feeling ) ; and finally presenting always a surprisingly recognizable object to meet the headlong body and soul . There are strong souls that agitate our souls by their motion ; there are many fewer that make us breathe deeper with pleasure as we are driven along ; but what is miraculous is for the deep need and hunger then released in us , to be met pat by an object adequate , and we live both deeply and face to face . Those are the people who Come Across ! That is a party ! That is the Way ! That was the ability of Horatio . Horatio came across ! We know that the young man was sick . When he came in the door , the surprising sight of his familiar friends reduced him to black boredom . His organs crept apart from one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary powers . This was so . Yet lucky for us ! the impotence and the agony that he was suffering in some last desperate conflict with misery , could not prevent his presence from being to us the fountain , kept flowing and sweet by years of fearless attentiveness , of overbrimming love . Ability streamed through him , though he himself sat ashamed . Parties can be classified according as they combine the party sports ; some sports are mutually supporting and some are incompatible . There are dancy parties and drinky parties , and drinkydancy parties . And drinky-talky parties . It is difficult to combine drink and talk and dancing . There are drinky-sexy parties , and drinky-dancy-sexy parties . There are drinky-talky-eaty parties . ( All parties are drinky parties . ) Drinky-talky-sexy parties are common , but it is not my experience that they are good parties ; for if the talk is good , the released sexuality is not the sexuality of parties , but if the talk is aimed toward the sexuality of parties , it is stupid . Drinky-eaty-sexy parties are unhealthful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drinky-singy parties are pleasant but soporific . But on all parties there must sink down the golden spirit of ease and joy , that from that hour one is likely to be happy . The party on Jane Street was proving to be a drinky-dancy-sexy party . Besides being made rich by the presence of great decorative friendly dogs . Horatio saw his familiar friends . They were hostile . The smiling young woman was Rosalind . He shrank , not to be hurt . Because obviously they were not hostile to him , he felt his shrinking as black boredom . He was afraid to expose his ordinary powers . He was ashamed to destroy his familiar friends by exercising his ordinary  | powers . He longed to be back in the open world where the lust for exploration might be strong enough to break through diffidence and bring him near some stranger . He began at once to invent pretexts to escape . Rosalind put her arm around him . Enchanted by the lovely sight of the workman caring for his tools , she could not forget that scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving us his love , power and attention , as we were giving him ours . He did not think so , but we were more nearly right  --  the observer is always more nearly right . But he had the power to rush into the future according to his error , perhaps to a rash act . He was " objectively happy . " His circumstances , health , fortune , friends , luck and even his state of mind were happy . Also , in the throes of some last desperate conflict , he was overwhelmed in black boredom , shame , fright and pain . But this case is by no means rare : indeed it occurs , as it is among us , with every person who can fly . The works of creative joy that we receive from such a person come surely from his conversation with blessed life ( from where else would they come ? ) ? yet he may not have any pleasure from the conversation even at the moment of conversing ; instead he lives , does indeed live , in guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horatio 's palm , stared up at him , grieving and whining . The dog loved him . With a cry of fright , that may have been a call of gaiety " Come , follow me ! " Horatio ran away from the party , without a pretext . " Come follow , follow me ! " into the dangerous open , where there was no community of human relations . He was accompanied , out of the way , by the presence of the absence of his dead friends . There was lively conversation , that he could not make out , but he heard his name called , " Horace ! " It was eerie to hear his name called out , and he looked vainly up at the top-story windows . His eyes began to burn as if he were about to weep . He began to weep tears that blinded him and sobs that made him choke . Small whistling noises sounded in new channels in his head . His eyes terribly burned , as though he would cry them out . The forgotten loves he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those he could still not remember were there , for it was all the same . He moaned , " Lost ! Lost ! " Some he had abandoned through circumstances that had seemed great but were trivial in comparison with the woe of abandoned love . Some because of the fatigue of long frustration , but there was no fatigue like the aftermath of abandoned love . Some he had lost through stupidity and then abandoned them out of anger with himself . Some he neces-  | sarily had abandoned because they were dead , just in order to live on again . Later , when he was already tired and sick , he gave up the chances of love because he was sick and tired . His character was the history of the loves he had abandoned ; they flashed into his mind and he moaned " Lost ! Lost , " too late for him ever to give in to love again . He could not give in to loving ; what were these strangers to him ? But it was impossible for him to continue as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years ( either prospect was sad ) until he shortly died . He began to bawl in earnest , because it was himself he was bawling for . He was afraid of death and loss . It was himself that was abandoned , in the dangerous open . Will not one who had appointed himself , and has dismissed himself , come to fly ? In a place where a warehouse had burned out and collapsed , one could , picking one 's way , again get to the edge of the water . It was dark . Horatio picked his way and looked out , in the darkness , on the broad river . Now the river seemed to him to be female . And the lighted tugboats , silently furrowing the water as they rapidly drove by , seemed to him to be male . The Hudson River upbore them and came rolling to the shore in passionate waves . It seemed to him to be an easy thing , not a violent thing , to exert his ordinary powers as need or inner need called them forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such acts . To walk exerting pressure on the ground ; to pick his way delicately along narrow planks by shifting his center of gravity from side to side . To look out and see the nature of the case . To talk with wit and gaiety about the nature of the case . To recall the past in memory and to mourn for it . To erect his penis in the presence of an object of desire . To fly with the accumulated power of the existing moment from the beginning of time rushing into the next moment : making it up as he went along  --  on the way . There was nothing in the exertion of power to warrant him shame or fear ; there was nothing enviable in it ( subject to the evil eye ) because , whatever else , everybody had a good sample of an existing moment . " We have omitted to play a funeral game in memory of them , in order that we may again begin to live on a little , " thought Horatio . " I must get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy sank down on him , that from that hour he was likely to be happy . He was waiting almost confidently for objects and occasions of desire to present themselves . They would not have to be remarkable or very lucky , because in this mood he could have made golden things out of improbabilities . Impulsively he held out both his factor hands before him , the  | fingers stretching open to the most space . With a cry of astonishment he saw that all the ten fingers were whole and intact . The tip of the little finger of his right hand was not missing , if indeed it ever was .  | Chapter 6 THE CARCASES And they shall go forth and look upon the carcases of the men .. . ? IsA. 66:24 1 . Our friends could fly through space , till they hit the ground and broke their bones . There is no advantage in concealing it  --  what must be obvious to many readers but I usually conceal it from myself ; these gentle persons , my heroic friends , were crippled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the period of the system , prophesied by Eliphaz . Most people were walking entranced , till they fell with the asphyxiation . But our friends , who dissented , were inevitably also destroyed . The handy youths were maimed ; Emily had a cancer ; Lothair was stricken dumb , Horatio blind ; Mynheer had splitting headaches ; and Laura , we saw , no longer left her room . Our friends had abilities , inventions , beyond the average . Up to a certain moment their vigorous activity concealed , by-passed , the underlying fact ; but then it became evident that they were poisoned ? there is no use concealing it . This horde of cripples , this disgusting company , crept , hobbled , squatted and schemed amid thousands of walking dead . Some of the thousands looked as sick and defective as our friends , but others looked sleek and shapely enough ; but none of them could fly ? whether to go aloft or simply to launch into free space and break their bones , easily giving themselves to gravity . But our friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little but usually simply giving themselves to a free space  --  hard to find a free space for the exercise  --  and breaking their bones . And a sickening thought occurred to them as they hit with a sick thud ( their sickly bodies were prone to generate sickening thoughts ) : the thought that they gave themselves to the free space like fools because they were ashamed of their deformities ; or that they were so disgusted and disheartened  | by their unhappy gaits and states that they chose rather to dare and luckily die than exist further . The souls of persons in a dilemma , the cowering souls of natural children as they grow and make hard choices : Either to dissent from the social community and thereby to grow sickly , deformed and mad  --  for where else is one to thrive ? ? or to conform to it and go mad and stifle . Air ! Air ! For there is a stink of putrefaction . ( This is the case , how it is ; what am I supposed , not to make a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the ground and lay whimpering , people avoided the place . But occasionally a knot gathered and summoned a policeman  --  for it was rightly understood that criminality , insanity , political dissent and the exercise of practical intelligence came to the same thing and were best handled by the same means . When the policeman appeared our friends tried , then , to crawl away quick , like poisoned cockroaches in the kitchen when the light is turned on  --  not easy to be quick , for they were poisoned and maimed and consequently stupid . This horde of cripples was engaged in an open conspiracy , for it is impossible to have ability and invention and not , willingly or not , be inviting the structure of society to ruin . But it was not to be seen that much tumbled in ruins , though pieces fell down in choking clouds of dust . Meantime , to their own disadvantage , the conspirators superstitiously abstained from many useful social goods as if these were tainted . They devalued goods that were obvious , such as the wealth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood-heating , consoling acclaim of the crowd . Partly because we were hateful and resentful , but mostly because we were already crazy . On the other side , the targets of the conspiracy took the serious things of the conspirators to be jokes , and their jokes to be serious things . A general misunderstanding , little communication in the world . The slight estimation of the conspiracy by the vast majority was correct , it was correct  --  except that they were dead from the neck up and also from the neck down . The intentions of the conspirators were absurd and ineffectual but they were fighting for life , and they were poisoned , sick and deformed . This book is the annals of our open conspiracy . How we lived through the war . How we died in their war . How the duration lasted longer than the war . How our friends learned to fly . How Mynheer saw rise the constellation Man and wept . How we formed out of hate a community of human relations . How Horatio was miraculous at the party for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little communication in the world . One of our friends , a young painter , fell on more evil days than  | he was used to . He reacted to this daily disaster with hysterical vomiting every morning , clutching his midriff and throwing up . Other friends came to this Job and cried , " Look , boy ! This is just an emotional reaction . Things are bad but this behavior does n't help anything  --  it is simply stupid . Wake up ! Open your eyes ! Face the facts ! " " Ow ! " cried the painter . " And what else do you think I do ? Every morning I wake up  --  I open my eyes  --  I face the facts . . . ugh . . . " and he clutched at his midriff. 2 . The most pitiful to see were the two youths , Droyt and Lefty , for especially in youth we read the soul in the body and they were stricken in the obvious limbs . Droyt stood strong and upright , but his right arm came to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hacked off at one of our schools . ( Not their schools , but one of our schools ; this is what makes it more bitter . ) Nevertheless , he looked at you fearless enough , unashamed , as if he would deal you a hammer blow of anger with his missing fist . Lefty 's spine was twisted . Bending his head , he wore a silly smile , but if he lifted his head he had a grimace of pain . The third or fourth vertebra below the neck was deformed so that he could not bring forward his left hand to defend himself ; if he advanced that hand , it , and soon his whole frame , began to tremble spectacularly . He bent forward at the hips , as if afraid to fall , or seeking to drop . He was ashamed of his deformity and often hid himself , or sat on cushions in his characteristic posture which was then less betraying . Also , with the peculiar vitality of human beings , he made his relaxation profitable by crooning and eventually writing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole-tone harmony , that sapped the courage of the listener . Or another time , overwhelmed with self-disgust , he recklessly cast himself into free space and for a moment the weight of the earth disburdened itself from his neck and shoulders ; for he could indeed fly a little . But he fell heavily on a pavement , more broken than before , like a star . The passers-by , with the well-known charity of the Americans , gave him a wide berth , for he was suffering . And his pugnacious and terrifying brother bore him safely home  --  where his crazy mother nursed him , and his father was sitting on a chair with an ice bag on his head . Such were the athletes with whom we intended to make up a memorial ballgame , to labor out our mourning in order to be able to live on again .
