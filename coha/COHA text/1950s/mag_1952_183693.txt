The Campaign <P> Sir : ... As I read the Oct. 20 issue of TIME . I found it harder ... to swallow the lump in my throat ... I never thought I would live to see the day in America when the people 's votes would be dictated by questionable labor leaders and a politician of the puny stature of Harry Truman . I have about concluded that Americans are not using their heads in this election as clearly as the people in Egypt , who are wholeheartedly uniting to throw out corrupt government . What is the matter with us when we do n't . . . read the telltale signs of national decline in the deflated dollar , crooked government , and a " something for nothing " philosophy . . . ? Mr. Stevenson is a clever man . . . but I am convinced the present situation of our country will overpower him , much though he would like to put an end to the corruption . . . <P> THELMA LUMSDEN CLAFLIN Upland , Calif . <P> Sir : I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can remember how Truman squirmed , swore , etc. when some Republicans brought Government men up for trial for treason . The investigations were not Truman 's idea at all , but he will now have us believe he had his housecleaning done . . . <P> MRS . W. A. RICE <P> Grayson , Ky . <P> Sir : <P> ... I would like to express my own opinion , and that of all decent-minded people , on how disgusted we are at the manner in which President Truman is conducting his campaign for Stevenson . That a President of these great United States should so belittle himself , and speak so unfairly of a very wonderful and respected man " as General Eisenhower , is unthinkable . . . <P> <P> MARY T. FARLEY Cresson , Pa . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Why does TIME report the names in art and letters that have switched from Eisenhower to Stevenson , as if it were important ? This group has never been noted for its political astuteness ; and I suspect the switches are based on a fascination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are about the least necessary qualifications in a President today . . . <P> <P> E. L. CHUBBUCK <P> Ossining , N.Y . <P> Sir : <P> Poor Adlai ! Here is a man who prepares intelligent speeches , presents them in the best diction , and gets chided for sounding " too good " and not having the " down to earth " approach ... I say he has the right idea and to hell with the Taft clique and smug Republican governors who sit on their thrones and moan for his neck . . . <P> SGT . S. E. JOHNSON Formosa <P> Sir : <P> ... It is claimed that the common man has nothing to gain by voting the Stevenson ticket , that he , Stevenson , appeals only to the intellects . Does this not imply that the public is positively stupid and therefore can not even understand the English language as used by Stevenson ? . . . <P> If we do n't want an intelligent man for our President , who do we want ? Certainly not a tin soldier whose strings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GEORGE T. MIEDL Columbus , Ohio <P> Sir :
