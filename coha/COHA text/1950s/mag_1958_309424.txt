Converging on Paris this week , the foreign ministers of the NATO nations all chanted the same defiant cry : we will not surrender Berlin . But when it came to concrete proposals on just how to counter the Russian threat to Berlin , the NATO war cry turned out to be subject to as many shades of interpretation as a Biblical text . <P> Beyond its sharp rejection of Khrushchev 's proposal to turn West Berlin into a " free city , " nobody knew what else the U.S. thought should be done . Just out of the hospital , Secretary Dulles-who carries the U.S. State Department in his hat-took along position papers to study on the plane that bore him to Paris . Britain 's Selwyn Lloyd saw a chance , in Germany 's difficulties , to impress on the West Germans that British exclusion from Europe 's Common Market is quite as important in British eyes as the Berlin crisis . On Berlin itself , the British argued that instead of rejecting the Soviet ultimatum outright , the West should counter by proposing a summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reunification and disarmament . <P> To the French , Britain seemed to be exhibiting far more " nervousness " than the Berlin crisis warranted . " The worst thing in the world , " said one French official in tones of Gallic superiority , " would be to become alarmist and lose one 's sangfroid . " As for West Germany 's Chancellor Konrad Adenauer , he regarded the British approach as downright dangerous . " Eliminate the Berlin threat , " growled Adenauer , in one private session , his cold-hoarsened voice trembling with anger . " Wipe it out entirely . Then I will talk about something else . " <P> Shiny Attraction . Part of the reason for Adenauer 's stand was his conviction ( based on " intelligence sources " ) that Khrushchev is currently engaged in some kind of power struggle in Moscow , as evidenced by the dismissal of the hated police boss Ivan Serov ( see below ) , and that an uncompromising Western stand on Berlin would strengthen the hand of Nikita 's critics within the Politburo . The Kremlin has indeed been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huffing and puffing on Berlin . It threatens time limits , then withdraws them . It fills the air with windy ultimatums . Last week the Russians said again that unless the Western powers showed themselves ready to discuss the status of Berlin " in a businesslike manner , " the U.S.S.R. would turn control of the ground and air corridors to Berlin over to the East Germans , and if an attempt was made to keep the corridors open by force , warned Khrushchev , " this would mean war . " <P> Beneath the sound of saber rattling could be heard one steady note , that Russia is there to stay in East Germany , and that the usefulness of this unhappy but economically valuable possession is jeopardized by West Berlin 's shiny attraction . West Berlin continues to draw up to 10,000 East German refugees each month-including much of the intellectual elite , doctors , technicians , professors and university students .
