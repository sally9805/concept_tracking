The rubber balls buzzed like black bees . They slithered along the walls , caromed in crazy zigzags , whupped out of the corners at speeds over 50 m.p.h. , or died on the floor in tiny , whirling bounces of reverse English . Flailing away with either hand , the scurrying players ricocheted shots off all four walls and the ceiling . At the staid Los Angeles Athletic Club , the ninth annual championship of the U.S. Handball Association was in full swing . <P> In principle , handball dates from the first time that a boy bounced a ball against a wall . Most authorities credit Irish immigrants of the 1840s with introducing the formal game to the U.S. , where it found an early fan in Abraham Lincoln . In the modern , furiously fast sport , the ball can be hit with either hand ( hand-ballers consider rackets sissy stuff ) . The most difficult shot is a " fly kill . " in which the player takes the ball in the air off the front wall , hits it against a side wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its forward speed by the time it reaches the front wall , skitters off it and drops dead . <P> " Run &; Sweat . " At first popular only in the East , handball was taken up by the Y.M.C.A.s , got a big lift in the ' 30s when the Federal Government 's make-work programs built hundreds of outdoor courts . Inexpensive to play ( a good pair of leather gloves costs only $5 ) , the sport now claims some 5,500,000 participants . " When you 're young , you play singles and run and sweat , " says one handballing Chicago doctor . " Later you take up doubles , and when you 're 70 , you pick a strong partner and just putter around . " <P> Running or just puttering , U.S. hand-ballers compete on courts ranging from a single concrete wall in a Brooklyn park to the four-walled , all-glass , air-conditioned , $32,000 pleasure dome given to an Aurora , Ill . Y.M.C.A. by Robert W. Kendler , founder and president of the U.S. Handball Association and chief evangelist of a sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , he is a Chicago millionaire ( building construction ) . Kendler bristles at the imputation that his game is a lowbrow cousin of squash , can point to such distinguished handballers as Literary Critic Lionel Trilling and television 's Art Linkletter . <P> The Champ . In Los Angeles last week , the fans that clustered on the seats above the backwalls of the courts had eyes chiefly for Kendler 's protege , a baby-faced Army private named Johnny Sloan , 23 . The defending champion , Sloan can curve and whistle a handball like a major-league pitcher . Before entering the Army , he worked for Kendler in Chicago . In the U.S.H.A. finals against Bob Brady , 36 , a fireballing San Francisco cop , Private Sloan was at the peak of his methodical , calm game ( " I 'm a controlled kill player " ) , won going away ( 21-20 , 21-9 ) to become indisputably the nation 's handiest handballer.
