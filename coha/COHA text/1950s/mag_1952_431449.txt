 | How HIGH CAN TAXES GO ? Condensed from The Saturday Evening Post Roswell Magill President of the Tax Foundation and former Under Secretary of the Treasury WE HAVE always thought of America 's resources and financial capacity as unlimited . We have everything here automobiles and the Grand Canyon and frozen orange juice , and once we had roast beef in every oven . Recently we have acted on the basis i hat we can have the highest standard of living in the world and pay r a few wars besides . But now there seems to be a catch . Congress passed and the President approved , last October , a tax bill designed to yield $5,700,000,000 on top of federal taxes that already had been taking about $6o,000,000,000 out of our pockets . The President says the tax bill still is n't big enough . The implication is that he will be hick for more at the next session of Congress . Some Congressmen are saying , however , that the tax burden ca n't he made greater without grave damto each of us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about reached the limit of our tax paying capacity , and it looks very much as if we have . Let 's take an average commuter , Henry Suburban . He might be any one of us . He ' pays an income tax , and a heavy one , as well as a socialsecurity tax . They come out of his pay check every week . But that 's only the beginning of his tax troubles . The new tax bill increased the federal tax on cigarettes to eight cents a pack . ( The average state tax adds another three to five cents . ) The tax on liquor went up to $2.6o a quart . But not all the taxes Henry pays are on luxuries . From the alarm clock which wakes him up to the toast that he chews as he dashes for his train , practically everything he touches has been taxed in one form or another . Just what is Henry 's total tax burden ? the part that he sees and the part that 's hidden ? Economists  | recently have studied Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have attempted to allocate the total tax burdens . On the basis of their estimates , if Henry 's family was in the $3000-to-$4000 income bracket in 1948 , and his income was the average for his bracket , $3500 , he would pay in personal income taxes ( federal , state and local ) $233 . In addition there would be the following , either paid by or passed on to him : corporation income taxes , $164 ; excise or sales taxes , $293 ; property taxes , $111 ; payroll taxes , $ro6 . Total , $907 . Thus a little over one fourth of Henry 's income went to government in taxes . But this fiscal year the Treasury may find it needs $4,000,000,000 more to balance the budget , and it might need $13,000,000,000 more the next year , since defense expenditures are finally getting into high : , ear . Where is the tax money to come from ? The well-to-do and the moderately prosperous have already been squeezed pretty dry . A lot of our people pay the Government more in taxes than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1951 will take almost 92 percent of the top earnings of individuals in the highest bracket . The rates of tax , state and federal , applicable to many individuals will be a little over too percent . Only the fact that the federal government allows a deduction for state taxes prevents such tax -- payers from having to pay more than they earn for the privilege of earning additional money . Even if we put a Too percent tax on all taxable income over $io , 000 , the Treasury would get less than $3,500,000,000 more money . To get $ro , 000,000,000 more from the individual income tax , the Treasury would have to take all taxable income over S000 . Taxing the man with the smaller income is equally difficult . Department of Labor figures show that there is very little fat in a worker 's income out of which more taxes can be squeezed . Perhaps we can learn a lesson here from England . In April 1950 the London Economist published a table showing that the current socialwelfare expenditures of the British Government amounted to 57 shillings per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes paid by the average low-income family in 1948 were 67.8 shillings per week  - -  -  or ten shillings per week more than the welfare benefits it received . These figures applied to Elm dies with incomes under $2015 a year , and they made up about 8o percent of the British population . Thus the government program , initiated largely for the benefit of the low-income groups , had reached a point where the taxes on the beneficiaries were greater than the benefits . Ca n't we hang the additional taxes on corporations ? That wo n't hurt us  - -   - -  or will it ? The 191 tax  | law will take more than half of corporation earnings ; in some cases up to 70 percent . The only money the corporation has is what it gets from selling goods to its customers . It must try to add the tax to the price of its goods . Which means that you and I pay it . Or the tax will come out of earnings t hat would go to stockholders or out of money needed to expand the business and keep production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axes you and I can be required to pay ? Must we look forward to paying a quarter or a half of our incomes lo the federal treasury all through the indefinite future ? Is there any limit to federal expenditures except the collective judgment  - -  -  or imaginations ? of Congressmen ? Colin Clark , the Australian economist , recently examined this question . Looking at the experience of France after World War I , and again in the 1930 's , he came to the conclusion that when the government begins to take more than 25 percent of he national income inflation sets in . As money begins to be worth less and as total national income rises in terms of a currency of lesser value ? stabilization point is usually ached when taxes are once more hiking only about one quarter of the national income . Mr. Clark 's conclusions are supported by the experience of Great Britain , Italy , Japan , I inland , Switzerland , Denmark , Sweden , and to some extent the United States during the 1940 's . Where do we stand now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States were about 29 percent of the national income . ( They were 38 percent in Great Britain . ) If we assume that there will be a higher level of national income this year and next , tax increases levied in the latest tax bill will raise the percentage in the United States to 32 percent . We are treading hard on the heels of Great Britain in driving out any incentive to produce and in inviting catastrophic inflation . But have we really reached the end of the road ? If new tax money is so hard to find , why bother ? Why should we break our backs to balance the budget if expenditures are climbing and taxes are already so heavy ? Why not let the Government run a deficit ? For years the Government has been going into debt issuing bonds to pay its bills , instead of collecting enough taxes to balance expenditures . The result is inflation and a dollar that 's now worth only about 50 cents . We 've got to stop it or the dollar wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt is not to spend so much . The federal government could try that . Students of the problem have shown that seven to ten billions of dollars can be cut out of the budget without any real damage to anything that absolutely needs to be done by the Government . If the federal budget is cut that much , we wo n't have to have any  | new taxes . But you 'll have to do without some governmental frills . You 'll have to get along without that new yacht basin in Bureau Creek , without Government loans for snake farms and fur ranches , and special calendars for Congressmen at a cost of $6000 per year ? equal to all the income taxes paid in a year by 27 families earning $4000 a year . There is no satisfactory or tolerable way to raise 70 , 75 or 8o billion dollars for the federal government to spend . It ca n't be obtained from the well-to-do . They do n't have it left to pay . It ca n't be obtained from corporations , without killing their activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consumer . Seventy or 8o billion dollars can be obtained only by taxing you and me much more heavily than we 've ever been willing to stand for . We have n't been willing to stand for it because the money . we would pay in taxes is what otherwise we would spend for the things that make life worth living . We do n't absolutely have to have them . We can get along on less . But we 've never been willing to cut our standards of living in order that the Government can spend more than was ever spent before in a time of peace . The only way to get the budget down is to wipe the slate clean ? to wipe off the old lush peacetime authorizations and start over again with a shorter list of items and a smaller total that we can afford in times like these . If federal expenditures ca n't he reduced , you and 1 arc certainly going to have to stand for higher and still higher federal taxes ? on ourselves . The bill must be paid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation ? which is worse  --  or through both .
