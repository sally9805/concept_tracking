The cardbinieri dragging the bottom of Lake Orta on the Swiss-Italian border in June 1950 were looking for the body of a man who had been dead six years . It seemed unlikely that they would succeed . But from the lake 's cold , glacier-fed depths came a corpse in what looked like surprisingly good repair . Legal delays prevented its examination for four days , and in those days it suffered more visible change than it had during its long immersion . Even so , the U.S. Army 's Pathologist Walter Lentino was able to make some positive identifications : <P> Sex : external organs missing , but absence of internal female organs and presence of a piece of stubble-bearded skin on the neck clinched it as male . <P> Height : 6 ft. 2 in . Race : white ( from the hair ) . <P> Age : from bone formations and skull sutures , middle or early 40s . <P> Length of immersion : more than one year , because the flesh had undergone saponification , i.e. , turned soft and soaplike , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identification : a funnel-chest deformity , analysis of teeth and fillings . <P> Criminal evidence : two bullets in the skull . <P> <P> Thanks to these findings , the body was identified as that of Major William V. Holohan , 40 , the OSS agent who had mysteriously disappeared during a mission far behind the enemy lines in December 1944. * What fascinated Pathologist Lentino , as he now reports in the A.M.A. Journal , was the amazing state of preservation of the internal organs . As his trained eye looked at the organs , though they were six years dead , it was simple for him to identify instantly the stomach and heart , liver and spleen . But when he took specimens of them for laboratory examination , the microscope showed that the tissues ( normally complex and distinctive ) had disintegrated . There was no way to tell , from a microscopic examination of the tissues alone , what had been heart or what had been liver . <P> Dr. Lentino 's conclusion : more crimes might be solved if doctors studied how long it takes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timetable , to show how long a body has been immersed . A major problem is that few of the world 's waters are as cold and pure as Lake Orta 's . <P> <P> *Three Italians were tried for murder but released by Italian courts ; two U.S. Armymen , Aldo Icardi and Carl LoDolce , were convicted by Italy in absentia but can not be extradited for punishment , nor can they be tried for the crime in the U.S.
