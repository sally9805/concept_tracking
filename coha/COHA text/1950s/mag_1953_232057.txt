Among the operagoers who heard Italian Tenor Mario Del Monaco sing at Milan 's La Scala last week was a blind woman named Irene Meyer , 33 , from Gaithersburg , Md . Two years before , she had heard him sing Radames in Ada at Manhattan 's Metropolitan . Stricken with incurable diabetes , Irene told friends in Gaithersburg that what she wanted most of all was to hear Del Monaco once again . What happened could have happened only in the U.S. , where people 1 ) form committees , 2 ) believe that dreams come true . Irene went to Milan on funds donated by The Committee to Enable Irene to Listen Again to Her Tenor .
