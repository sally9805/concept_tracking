CORPORATIONS Protection Inc . <P> While a military guard stood at attention , the original copies of the Declaration of Independence , the Constitution and the Bill of Rights , temporarily kept in the Library of Congress , were put this week in their permanent home in the National Archives Exhibition Hall . Their home is a big glass showcase which , at the touch of a button , sinks slowly through the floor into a huge vault in the cellar . The 50-ton safe , a bombproof , thiefproof , fireproof stronghold with 15-in. thick walls and 5-ton armored doors will keep the historic documents as safe as the gold in Fort Knox . By day , the documents will be on exhibition ; at night , they will repose in the $30,000 vault built by the Mosler Safe Co. , " the biggest-and trickiest-safe in the world . " <P> Hidden Assets . By taking on such jobs , the 104-year-old Mosler Safe Co. has become the world 's largest safemaker . It built the huge vaults at Fort Knox , designed the complex system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So many Tokyo banks installed Mosler 's vaults that when the U.S. Army was searching for hidden hoards of Japanese gold and securities , Mosler could give them all the detailed floor plans they needed as well as shrewd hints where to look . <P> Today , three out of four U.S. bank vaults , and half of all private safes , are Moslers . They hold , says President Edwin Mosler , two-thirds of the world 's negotiable wealth , along with such oddments as the gold spike which joined the first transcontinental railroad , a set of George Washington 's false teeth and all the United Nations treaties . Mosler makes everything from a $25 insulated cashbox for householders to a $1,000,000 , two-story vault . <P> Safekeeping . Mosler 's great-grandfather , a German immigrant , started out by making wheelbarrows . Later he switched to strongboxes , and before long his safes , with bulls ' heads and baskets of fish painted on the doors , were standard equipment in most butchers ' and fish dealers ' shops . <P> The company sells its product by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mosler : " There are four times as many crooks as policemen in the U.S. , and they commit more than 1,000 burglaries a day . Four out of every ten firms that lose their records in a fire go out of business . " Safecrackers keep Mosler 's designers on their toes . The cracksmen keep up with the latest technology and quickly find any weak spot in a new design . <P> Recently , when Mosler offered a booklet . What You Should Know About Safes , one request came from a burglar serving a life term in the Texas State Prison . " When puzzle locks i.e. , combination locks were first used a century ago , " said Mosler , " crooks devised the ' drag , ' a powerful screw to crush the walls around the lock . When the walls were strengthened , they took to the jackscrew to force wedges between the door and the jamb . When safe doors were built with bolts that slid into the jamb on all four sides , safecrackers began blowing gunpowder around the door with an air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power drills .
