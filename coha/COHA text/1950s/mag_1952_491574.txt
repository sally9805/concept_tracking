22 communist until Whittaker Chambers had been a communist for seven years did he learn that the Communist Party maintains a wide va- riety of hidden , conspiratorial ' organizations collectively called the Underground . He learned this abruptly when , in 1932 , he was tapped for membership in it . Prior to that he had labored as writer and editor of party publications and had done other party chores . He had kept clear of intramural squabbles over power , and had felt a deep revulsion for the bloodless purges of factions , a process which slavishly reflected the bloody purges abroad by which Stalin finally gained control in Soviet Russia . In " going underground " Chambers , as was customary , gave up membership in the " open party " and shunned his former party associates ; he became ostensibly " a respectable bourgeois , " on an allowance of $100 a month . For two years he was kept busy in and around New York in an atmosphere of microfilm and invisible ink ; of furtive rendezvous in restaurants , movie theaters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know , to strangers whom he would never see again ; of helping to arrange the theft of technical blueprints . It was not long before Chambers deduced that his work was only superficially in behalf of the American Communist Party and that actually he was in the employ of a Soviet underground organization . This later proved to be the Soviet Military Intelligence . In the spring of 1934 he transferred his activities , on order , to Washington , D.C. , where he was given special duties affecting the little-publicized Ware Group , which was perhaps the most successful cabal of conspirators in American history . One of the leading members of the Ware Group was Alger Hiss . ? The Editors 3 .

But their activities , in promoting the Carthaginian mangling of Europe and the triumph of communism in China , have decisively changed the history of the world . Nobody starts from nowhere , and seldom does anyone start alone . Beside Alger Hiss , from his earliest days in Washington , stood another key conspirator . His name was Harold Ware , and his friends all called him Hal . In 1934 , Ware was a trim , middle-aging man of medium height with a plain face decorated only by rimless eyeglasses from which a fine gold chain looped behind one ear . Outwardly , Ware was as American as ham-and-eggs ; he looked like a quietly earnest professor in some agricultural college or a progressive county agent . He was also the son of Ella Reeve Bloor , a kind of official " mother " of the American Communist Party . He was therefore what might be called a birthright communist . Though he liked to drive automobiles at breakneck speed  --  a sport that was to kill him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The soil was in his pores , as it was in mine . In the late 1920 's he and other American radicals went to Russia , where they established an experimental collective farm in the Kuznets basin  --  the so-called Kuzbas colony . Ware , who had a quick mind , had perceived correctly , as early as the late 1920 's , that an American agricultural crisis  --  which turned out to be a forerunner of the world financial and industrial crisis  --  was coming to a boil . The Kuzbas colony failed , but Ware did n't . The Communist International was also convinced that the time had come to organize the American farmer , and Ware  --  so he once told me ? returned to the United States with $25,000 of the International 's funds in a money belt . When the New Deal got into full swing , Ware got himself into the Agricultural Adjustment Administration as a dollar-a-year man . It was not necessary for him to invest much of his nest egg in Washington , so , presumably , Ware was able to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country . Seldom has $25,000 bought so much history . The Formation of the Ware Group IN Washington , Ware was like a man who has I purchased a farm , sight unseen , only to discover that the crop was ready to harvest . All he had to do was hustle it into the barn . The barn , in this case , was the Communist Party . In the AAA and elsewhere in Washington , Ware found a bumper crop of registered or incipient communists . By 1934 , the Ware Group had developed into a tightly organized underground managed by a directory of seven men . It included a number of secret subcells whose total membership I can only estimate  --  probably between fifty and seventy-five communists . Almost from the first , it had been clear to Ware that the opportunities for the Communist Party in Washington went far beyond agricultural organization . He discussed the matter with J. Peters , Ware 's boss and mine . Peters , a short , swart Hungarian and an ex-officer in the Austro-Hungarian army , was head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He believed that it would be possible to slide the " career communists " out of the New Deal agencies , which the party could penetrate almost at will , into the old-line departments , with the State Department as a prime objective . Some members of the Ware Group were already so placed that they were in a position to influence policy at several levels . Over the years , their power to influence policy became greater . Nathan Witt , who came to the AAA as a lawyer , in 1933 was on the staff of the National Labor Relations Board . John J. Abt , another AAA lawyer , was later to be assistant counsel to the Works Progress Administration ; special counsel to the Securities &; Exchange Commission ( to prepare the case against Electric Bond and Share Corporation ) ; chief counsel to the LaFollette Civil Liberties Investigating Committee and , in 1937 , a special assistant to the Attorney General . Charles Kramer went from AAA to the National Youth Administration , to the LaFollette committee , to the Office of Price Administration , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continued on Page 4.8 ) I WAS THE WITNESS ( Continued front Page 23 ) Senate Committee on Wartime Health and Education . Henry H. Collins , Jr. , started in the National Recovery Administration and went through the grades to the Senate Committee on Small Business , and , during World War II , to the Senate Military Affairs Committee . As an Army Military Government officer he spent two years abroad . Victor Perlo , also an NRA baby , went on to the Home Owners ' Loan Corporation , to the Department of Commerce ( as senior Economic Analyst ) , to OPA ( as chief of the Statistical Analysis Branch of Research Division ) , to the War Production Board ( problems of military-aircraft production ) , to the Treasury Department , to which he was recom-mended by Assistant Secretary Harry Dexter White . White never joined the party , but was a devoted fellow traveler . Lee Pressman , an assistant general counsel of the AAA , was soon to become general counsel of the Works Progress Administration and of the Resettlement Administration , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the CIO . Alger Hiss , who in 1934 was also an attorney for AAA , had been offered , and soon was to accept , the post of counsel to the Senate ( Nye ) Committee Investigating the Munitions Industry , and thus to be instrumental in painting as " merchants of death " the industrialists who made the armaments which were indispensable to the national deferule . J. Peters ' meditations about the potential usefulness of the Ware Group probably covered more ground than did Hal Ware 's . Asa practical operator , Peters felt that it smacked of slipshod organization to leave so many promising communists in one large group in which everybody knew everybody else . He intended to separate the most likely members ( an invariable underground practice ) and place them in another underground ? a parallel apparatus , to use the trade term  --  which would be much more rigorously segregated and subdivided . When advisable , other communists would be added to this special apparatus from other wider-grounds in Washington ; for the Ware Group was not the only underground in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peters assigned to me . The nucleus of the special apparatus was to be Alger Hiss , an exceptional communist for whom Peters had an unusual regard . On my first day in Washington , Peters introduced me to Hiss , in the presence of Ware , in a downtown cafeteria . The meeting was a brief one . Within the next few days I met most of the other leaders of the Ware Group . I was introduced , and thereafter was known , to all simply as Carl . The European practice of using underground pseudonyms was excitingly new to the Washington revolutionists . To them , I became a figure of awe , not because of anything I pretended to be  --  I was simple and friendly  --  but because that was what those young zealots wanted me to be and made me . To them , I reflected power in one of its more fascinating forms  --  invisible power . In advance of my arrival in Washington , Ware had apparently dropped some discreet words about my special experience , and I found that this had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " them " ? the Russians . So great is the revolutionary spell of the word " Russian " that American communists , who might hesitate tad() certain things for another American communist , will all but beg to do the same thing for a Russian or anyone directly connected with the Russians . This attitude , which must seem outrageous or incredible to noncommunists , was the tribute that hope paid to success . The Russian revolution had succeeded . The heart of every revolution is a struggle for power , and there was little that the bright young men of Washington worshiped more fervently than power , often without being at all aware of it . Another thing that gave me a kind of spurious glamour in the eyes of the Washington underground was the way I handled conversational English . There were certain turns of expression and certain tones of voice that sounded European . The reason for this was that I had been with Russians a great deal during my New York experiences and , to make myself understood quickly , had taken to simplifying my sentences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relying , like a European , on intonation rather than phrasing to express shades of meaning . On my first visit to the Hiss apartment on 28th Street , which was brief and awkward , I sensed a feeling of hostility , especially on the part of Alger 's wife , Priscilla . A night or two later I made a second visit . This time there were welcoming smiles and Alger was gracious in the way which is his peculiar talent . Graciously , he ventured an explanation ; he was sorry about the other evening , but at first he had not known what to make of me . I had said that I was an American , but I was not like any American he had ever known . Then he had suddenly understood it all ? I was a European who had spent some years in the United States ; my mastery of English was remarkable  --  later , when we drove together , Alger would also be struck by my remarkable knowledge of American roads . To Alger Hiss , Carl was one of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a member of one of the old subject nationalities that had been liberated by the revolution . I was astonished and delighted by the change in atmosphere . We spent a very pleasant evening together . An effort has been made to describe the Ware Group as merely a " Marxist study group . " This is not true . It is true that there was Marxist-Leninist political instruction , given sometimes by J. Peters , and there was discussion afterward . For Peters kept the group under close personal supervision , coming down from New York monthly , and sometimes oftener . On trade-union and other labor problems one member , Lee Pressman , occasionally consulted in New York with Jack Stachel , one of the party 's top men in trade-union work . Stachel is one of the eleven top communists who were convicted in New York City in 1949 . He was sentenced to five years in jail by Federal Judge Medina . All the members of the Ware Group were dues-paying members of the Communist Party , and Peters considered the group , together with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income . I am quite sure that I am right in remembering that members of the Ware Group regularly paid 10 per cent of their salaries to the Communist Party and were subject to special assessments , besides . It was a point with J. Peters , stressed by him to the group , that since its members were intellectuals without " open " party experience , it was exseparation  --  and his inactivity , at first , in the special apparatus  --  so wearing that he broke the rules and spent a few hours with his former cell mates . I winked at these irregularities . In New York there were Soviet plans in the making ? which were never realized ? to send me to England to set up another special apparatus . While they were pending , I moved my wife and infant daughter to a Baltimore apartment , on St. Paul Street . I rented the place under an assumed name , Lloyd Cantwell . The apartment was in an old brick building which was headquarters for the Woman 's Christian Temperance Union ; this seemed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place with some old secondhand furniture . My wife was charmed with Baltimore and with our apartment . Mt . Vernon Place was two blocks away , and there she could sun the baby . With the arrival of my family in Baltimore in the summer of 1934 , there began a development of a kind that is not favored in underground work . The Hisses became our personal friends in a way that made my relationship with Alger unlike my relationship with most others in the underground . I relaxed the underground procedures by bringing Alger and his wife to visit us in Baltimore one night . Another factor entered in too . Their personal connection with us rescued Alger Hiss from his underground isolation . There was a with Alger Hiss was a friendship that existed on two incongruous levels . One was the level of conspiracy , which threw Hiss and me together in the first place and held us together for more than three years in the tight , exclusive secrecy of the underground . The second level seemed to have nothing to do with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association of two literate , happy , fun-loving middle-class families who had a good deal more in common than the dark revolutionary bond that united Alger Hiss and me . But it was much more si friendship of families than of individuals , and on the Hiss side entirely so . Alger and Priscilla Hiss could scarcely be thought of separately . Alger and Pross was one name , and so was Hilly and Pross  --  as they called each other . On the level of conspiracy , Alger dealt exclusively with Carl . But on the human level , Carl and Lise were almost as much a bracket as Alger and Pross . Our friendship was almost entirely one of character and not of the mind . Despite his acknowledged ability in the legal field , which I was not competent to explore with him , Alger Hiss is not a very mental man . He was a little on the stuffy side . Ideas for their own sake did not interest him at all . His mind had come to rest in the doctrines of Marx and Lenin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom , that I can remember , to history or to theory . I particularly remember Alger 's opinion of Shakespeare . " I 'm sorry , " he once remarked when I was discussing a Maurice Evans performance of Richard II . " I just do n't like Shakespeare  --  platitudes in blank verse . " He quoted some Polonius and I realized , for the first time and with great interest , that he disliked Shakespeare because the platitudes were what chiefly impinged on his mind . So great a gap in the temper of minds might have been expected to set us apart . On the contrary . To me , such blind spots as Alger 's were another amusing foible , and , in any case , I do not particularly care to be surrounded by literary friends . The bond that cemented his friendship and mine went ( Continued on Page 52 ) 52 February 23 , 1952 ( Continued front Page 49 ) much deeper than any similarities or dissimilarities of mind . It was a profound , tacit esteem of character , increasing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us shared another more elusive , but very real bond . That was the mutual simplicity of our tastes , which reflected not merely a point of view , like our political opinions , but was an almost organic reaction to the life around us . It was expressed in a profound suspicion of the pursuit of pleasure as an end in life , amounting to an antipathy and merging with a deep distaste for and distrust of materialism in its commonest forms of success and comfort . That kind of simplicity is inseparable from a gentleness of character , though life and history may wrench and pervert it almost past recognition . In the Hisses , it found one expression in an absorption in nature , especially in the life of birds . When I first knew them , they used to rise at dawn on Sundays and take long rambles out along the Potomac River , around Glen Echo and Great Falls . I remember vividly how Alger came in one morning and announced , with an excitement that he almost never showed , that for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up bird walking in 1934 . But even in the days of his greatest underground activity , Alger Hiss talked frequently about birds with an enthusiasm that he showed for little else . It was an enthusiasm that I shared with the Hisses , though I had passed the point where identifying birds interested me very much . The outstanding fact about Alger Hiss was an unvarying mildness , a deep considerateness and gracious patience that seemed proof against any of the ordinary exasperations of work and fatigue or of the annoyances of family or personal relations . Only very rarely did a streak of wholly incongruous cruelty crop out , as it did once in a conversation about President Roosevelt . Hiss 's contempt for Franklin Roosevelt as a dabbler in revolution , who understood neither revolution nor history , was profound . It was the common view of Roosevelt among communists , which I shared with the rest . But Alger expressed it not only in political terms . He startled me , and deeply shocked my wife , by the obvious pleasure he took in the most simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a symbol of the middle-class breakdown . Only once did that deeply hidden streak ever touch me . It came out connection with the poor condition of my teeth . Several times Alger had urged me tactfully to visit a dentist . Then one night , during the last year that I knew him , he evidently decided to be firm with me . He gave me a little lecture , the burden of which was that my teeth were not a personal mittter , but , as identifying marks , a hazard to everybody 's safety . My missing incisor must be replaced . He was oddly waspish , mincing no words . It was completely unlike him . I saw that I had touched something very important ? his fastidiousness . Throughout 1934 and 1935 I and my family  --  which was soon increased by the birth of a son  --  led a helter-skelter life . Because I was under strict orders to keep myself in instant readiness for the proposed organizing trip to London , we could n't invest in permanent furniture . Around the late spring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house on P Street , Washington , leaving their furniture in the 28th Street apartment , we occupied it , at Alger 's invitation , until the lease ran out some weeks later . After that , we stayed briefly in a furnished house in Greenwich Village , in a furnished house on the Delaware River in Pennsylvania ; then we lived briefly on the ( CAniti llll ed on rage 55 ) ( Cont " ed from Page 52 ) third floor of Hiss ' house on P Street . Next stops were an apartment on Eutaw Street , Baltimore , a friend 's farmhouse near Ferndale , Pennsylvania , and another place in Baltimore . Our social relationship with the Hisses remained close . Hiss , in his old Ford roadster ? which was later to play an important role in court  --  helped us move our personal belongings from Place to place ; and visits between our families were frequent . During this period Hiss bought a Plymouth sedan and gave his Ford roadster over to the party for the use of some organizer in the South or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title-transfer papers would leave a trail , but Hiss was adamant . I would have been shocked if I had known that Alger had asked a colleague in the Department of Justice  --  W. Marvin Smith , who later committed suicide during the Hiss Case  --  to notarize the transfer of title of the car . For Alger by that time had left the munitions investigation , and the Solicitor General of the United States  --  now Mr. Justice Stanley Reed had appointed Alger to his staff . Stanley Reed would have been dismayed had he known that Hiss consulted with the Communist Party , in my person , before accepting . Neither J. Peters nor the Soviet apparatus had any immediate purpose for Alger Hiss in the Department of Justice , but the change was a forward step in his career and might lead to widening contacts . So Alger moved into Reed 's office with the party 's blessing . It proved to be a good move . Alger had scarcely settled with the Solicitor General when Francis Sayre , then Assistant Secretary of State , asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed the propriety of accepting Sayre 's offer , after so short a time with the Solicitor General . But the opportunity to get Hiss into the big objective , the State Department , could not be passed up and the decision was that , at whatever the cost might be in the good will of the Solicitor General , Alger Hiss must accept the Sayre offer . He did . There was not a direct question of espionage at that time . But we knew what we were headed for , and we sometimes discussed it . In fact , as far back as Hiss ' connection with the Senate munitions-investigating committee , an isolated incident that smacked of espionage came off . Hiss once remarked to me that his position with the committee was so strong that , using the authority of the Senate , he could obtain confidential documents from the State Department , which I could then photograph and turn over to the Communist Party . This was done . Alger brought the papers home to his P Street house and I photographed them there . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereafter put a ban on further release of confidential documents . Expansion in other directions was carried out . The most successful had to do with Harry Dexter White , the fellow traveler who was an assistant treasury secretary and monetary adviser to Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau . I made contact with White through Abraham George Silverman , a Ware Group member who was chief economist of the Railroad Retirement Board . White , in our many secret talks , which he seemed to enjoy , talked endlessly about Morgenthau , whose moods were a fair barometer of White 's . If White 's spirits were up , I knew that the secretary was smiling . If he was depressed , I knew that the secretary had had a bad day . Far from being afraid of or annoyed by the demands of the party , he sometimes seemed to feel that we were neglecting him . Though it was n't realized at first , the special apparatus which was being built up mainly around Alger Hiss was what is known as a " sleeper apparatus . " Its first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of action may expose it . it waits for the future . It is a reserve unit which will be brought into play only when those in control see fit  --  when events dictate . It takes time to mature a good apparatus , and after a couple of years of work we had one . Any apparatus that includes an assistant to the Assistant Secretary of State and an assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury amply fills the definition of a " good " apparatus . It is a conservative assumption that at the present time there exists at least one " sleeper apparatus " in the United States . It is waiting for the time when orders reach it to pass from inactivity to active espionage . For the special Washington apparatus which I supervised , that time came in the autumn of 1936 , when J. Peters introduced me in New York to a Russian who , I learned subsequently , was Col. Boris Bykov . He had just arrived from Moscow and was a Soviet agent . Bykov was a strange character , even for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our meetings , to avoid the danger of being followed . His nerves were always coming apart in spasms of rage and suspicion . Bykov was actually a great coward with a pathological suspicion of everybody . We met once among the shops of the lower level of the RCA Building . Bykov kept nervously eying the window shoppers . He asked me who they were . When I told him , he replied in German : " Nein ! Geheimpolizei ( secret police ) ! " Almost everybody , in Bykov 's odd view , was a member of the Geheimpolizei . From his various cross-examinations of me , it was clear that he had already studied some report on the Washington contacts and had memorized it . He was interested most in Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White . " What is Hiss ' profession ? " he asked at one point . I told him in German that he was an Aduokat ( lawyer ) . " Henceforth , " ruled Bykov , " we will refer to him as Der Aduokat . " The Christmas holidays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts of money to some of the Washington sources . I was horrified , and tried to explain to him that , as communists on principle , they would be outraged at being given cash . Bykov did n't believe me . He said , " Who pays is boss , and who takes money must also give something . " To me , this privately translated into " Communism has turned to corrupting itself , " and henceforth I knew that I was in the pit , though my mind would seek to elude the knowledge for many months . Bykov 's " who pays is boss " kept running through my mind for months . It might well stand for every welfare-state philosophy . After much argument about money gifts , Bykov finally compromised on what he called a " costly present " for the Washington sources . He handed over $1000 , saying , " So that they will know that they are dealing with big , important people . You will buy four big , expensive rugs . You will give a rug each to White , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Henry Julian Wadleigh , a fellow traveler who began in the Department of Agriculture and later moved to the Trade Agreements Division of the State Department , from where he was to bring documents to be photographed . ) I had a friend buy the rugs , Orientals , and ship them to Washington . All the recipients , except Hiss , were delighted with their " costly presents . " Hiss ' rug was handsome , but it was red and very vivid . He kept it rolled up in a closet . The rugs were later to enable the Government to fix dates in the Hiss trials . On the four rugs we marched straight into active espionage  --  it was early in 1937 . Bykov began a personal inspection of the sources . Alger went to New York for his interview . I met him there and took him to the Prospect movie theater on Ninth Avenue , Brooklyn . Hiss and I were seated on a bench in the mezzanine when Bykov came out of the audience to greet us . We went over to Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bykov had himself well in hand . There was none of his usual rudeness . The socialist fatherland  --  Russia  --  he said , was threatened with encirclement by the fascist powers  --  Germany and Italy in Europe , Japan in the East . The other imperialist powers  --  Britain , the United States , France  --  were secretly abetting this encirclement , hoping that the fascists would destroy the Soviet Union for them . Now the conflict had risen to a new plane , and the Soviet Union was threatened by a greater , more conscious coalition . It would not succeed , of course . For one thing , the Soviet Union could count on the help of the comrades abroad . There were many ways of helping . Alger Hiss could help , too , for one of the great needs was information about the fascist plans . It was , for example , necessary to know what the State Department knew about them . It was necessary to see the actual documents  --  especially those relating to Germany and the Far East . " Ask him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help us in that way . " I smiled and dutifully put Bykov 's question to Alger Hiss , who also smiled . The question had been answered long ago . The preamble was superfluous . Alger said that he was prepared to do whatever Bykov wanted . " Ask him , " said Bykov eagerly , " if the brother will also bring out material . " By " the brother , " Bykov meant Donald Hiss , Alger 's younger brother , who had transferred from the Labor Department to the State Department , where he was a legal adviser to the newly created Philippines Division . Alger reflected and said no . I could have spared myself any concern about Bykov 's impression on Alger Hiss . Hiss said that he had found Bykov " impressive . " I had underrated the transforming power of anything Russian .
