High blood pressure , by itself , is not a disease and never killed anybody . Even in its commonest disease form , which doctors call " essential hypertension , " damage to the kidneys and other organs is the result of changes in the small arteries , not of the high blood pressure . Yet countless people start worrying themselves sick when they are told they have a high reading . <P> Well aware of such laymen 's worries , Dr. Arthur M. Master of Manhattan 's Mount Sinai Hospital and Dr. Louis I. Dublin of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. asked themselves : How high is high blood pressure ? To get the answer , they had to find out what is normal blood pressure-an item that a generation of researchers had failed to agree on . Dr. Dublin , aided by Statistician Herbert H. Marks , culled the health records of World War II workers at air bases and war plants , tabulated the blood pressure of 15,706 seemingly normal , healthy men &; women from 16 to 65 . They found a much greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they concluded , the definition of " normal " should be revised to fit the facts . <P> Physicians and insurance statisticians have made the mistake of looking too hard at the mortality tables , say the three authors in the Journal of the American Medical Association . The tables show more deaths among people whose blood pressure exceeds 140 mm. systolic and 90 mm. diastolic. * This fact is meaningless , they argue , because blood pressure usually increases naturally with age . So the thing to do is forget about an " ideal " reading , start with healthy people and accept their readings as normal . <P> From what they found to be normal in practice , Master , Dublin and Marks suggest these ranges as normal : <P> <P> MEN WOMEN Age Systolic Diastolic Systolic Diastolic 20 105-140 62-88 100-130 60-85 30 110-145 68-92 102-135 60-88 40 110-150 70-94 105-150 65-92 50 115-160 70-98 110-165 70-100 60 115-170 70-100 115-175 70-100 <P> On each side of the normal ranges , the authors think , there should be a twilight zone ( usually five to ten points wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked on with suspicion and carefully rechecked , but still with no conclusion that the patient had " high " or " low " blood pressure . Such a worrisome diagnosis would not be made , they suggest , until there was a clearly abnormal level , e.g. , low blood pressure for a man of 20 would be 98/56 or less , while high blood pressure would be 150/95 or more . At 40 , low would begin at 102/60 , and high would begin at 165/100 . ( For younger women the norms are slightly lower ; for older women , some are slightly higher . ) <P> Release from worry is the first thing prescribed by most doctors for patients with high blood pressure . The tables of Master , Dublin and Marks may be just the thing to help such patients stop worrying-or worry less . <P>
