Cuba 's slow-motion rebellion begins its third year next week , a study in inertia but nonetheless a tense and tragic struggle that must end in a crashing showdown . <P> Rebel Chieftain Fidel Castro , pushing out foot by foot from the Sierra Maestra , near which he landed Dec. 2 , 1956. now dominates a third of the island 's land area ( see map ) . His strength in guerrillas and arms is rising , but exactly how much is a secret veiled by the downed wires and cut roads that go into the wild country he lurks in . Dictator Fulgencio Batista keeps a hold on Havana , where a fifth of all Cubans live , and all other sizable cities , and still controls the labor unions , most of the press , an army estimated at 46,000 , an air force that includes bombers and pursuit planes . But he can not keep order , and apparently lacks the capacity or will to try a major offensive . <P> Scars of War . In the deadlock . Cuba increasingly shows the scars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , silent factories . Havana 's flashy hotels echo emptily . Trains that used to go to Santiago now stop short at Santa Clara , in mid-island . Planes fly from heavily guarded terminals , the passengers frisked before they board . <P> In blockaded Santiago ( pop . 200.000 ) , the rebels dare not take on the 3,000-man garrison commanded by Major General Eulogio Cantillo. the army 's best tactician . They also fall back before the Staghound armored cars that rumble out of Santiago-but close in again like wraiths when the Staghounds rumble back . <P> Business in rebel country is nearly dead . The ' Esso distributor in Santiago , who used to sell 2,000,000 gal . of gas monthly , now sells 250,000 ; the Pepsi-Cola , Coca Cola and Canada Dry plants operate only two or three days a month . Bacardi Rum 's main plant , which used to produce 144,000 bottles a day . last week closed for the first time since 1862 . Eggs that once cost 4 apiece are now 10 : most food prices are up at least 40% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity for more than a fortnight . In Guantanamo and Bayamo. townsmen use horse-drawn wagons because there is no gasoline . <P> Popular Opinion . The north coast Nicaro mines , source of 11 % of the free world 's nickel , are out of production : last week government bombers , aiming for the rebels , instead hit Nicaro warehouses containing $500,000 worth of machinery . The sugar crop . Cuba 's economic lifeblood . 75% of which comes from rebel-saturated Oriente . Camagey and Las Villas provinces , is largely in Castro 's hands , as the January harvest approaches . <P> Castro 's Cuba includes ten airfields and at least two captured DC-3s ( as well as some light planes ) . From secret bases , probably in Central America and Florida , planes ferry in arms . Castro now has some heavy machine guns , bazookas . 20-mm. and 75-mm. recoilless rifles . He has a network of two dozen radio transmitters . <P> Batista has almost no enthusiastic support among Cubans outside the government ; Castro , by contrast , gets ardent backing from students , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictatorship , and the political left . But the Cuban masses refuse the danger and cost of active support for Castro and , by abstaining , line up for Batista . The eventual solution for divided Cuba is no more foreseeable than that of another violence-torn island-far-off Cyprus .
