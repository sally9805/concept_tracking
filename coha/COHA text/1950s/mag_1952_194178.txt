Up to a Georgia schoolhouse one day last week drove a salesman named John Stacy Cotter . " Most people want to save , " he told Teacher Elizabeth Burke , " but most people do n't save . I can show you how . " Salesman Cotter had no promises of big returns to offer : if Teacher Burke would pay $16.70 a month for twenty years-a total of $4,008-she would get back $5,000 . Teacher Burke would earn only 1.91% interest on her money , far less than on a Government bond . Moreover , if Teacher Burke quit the plan before ten ' years , she could not even get out as much as she had paid in . It did n't sound like much of a deal , but within an hour Teacher Burke had not only bought it , but authorized Cotter to take the money out of her bank account each month by simply presenting a sight draft . <P> By promising so little , Salesman Cotter manages to make around $20,000 a year in commissions . His employer , Minneapolis ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such savings plans that its total assets last week were above the $1 billion mark . Most big-city dwellers have never heard of I.D.S. But in farm areas and small towns all over the U.S. and Canada , some 2,000 salesmen , who make $8 to $20 per year on every $1,000 plan sold , sign up contracts for $5,000,000 in savings each week . The big appeal lies in the fact that I.D.S. makes people save . Contract signers can not get out " even " until they have been in the plan several years , and once they have stayed that long , they have more to gain by staying all the way . Boasts I.D.S. 's Dallas Manager Clyde J. Moore : " We could sell the plan without any yield . All we need to say is here is a plan for money accumulation that will work . " <P> A Good III Wind . The plan does work . Since 1894 , when the company started on $2,600 capital , it has never failed to pay off an investor . It has not only weathered wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which blew it good . In 1943 , when SEC brought suit to compel I.D.S. to follow a policy of " full dis- osure , " stressing objections as well as advantages to its savings plans , I.D.S. discovered that underselling actually boosted its business . After hearing all the disadvantages ( low interest , losses on early cash-ins , etc. ) , cautious investors felt that candid I.D.S. was a company they could trust . <P> Moreover , once a sale is made , word-of-mouth advertising helps make others . Almost every buyer of a plan gladly signs a card introducing the I.D.S. man to another friend or neighbor ( doctors and professional men are the best customers , closely followed by farmers ) . If anybody fails to meet his second payment , I.D.S. refunds the first one and cancels the deal . I.D.S. feels " that man will just be trouble for us. "
