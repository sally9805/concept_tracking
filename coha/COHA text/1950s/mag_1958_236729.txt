" The American school system , from first grade through college has become a huge kindergarten . " So last week declared self-exiled Schoolmaster Philip Marson. who quit famed Boston Latin School last June after teaching English there for 31 years . Marson 's reason for walking out : " I could then say what had to be said without gloves . " <P> Marson 's bare-knuckled attack on U.S. education made the front page of the <P> Boston Globe . " I watched , with increasing alarm , the lack of fundamental information possessed by the pupils who entered the high school , and the disappearance of standards demanded of them by the colleges when they were ready to leave . The elementary schools , by misapplication of the theories of Dewey and Freud , had eliminated unpleasant work and had substituted play . . . The colleges had so diluted their entrance requirements that they ceased to function as incentives to scholarship . " <P> Those Who Only Breathe ? " In terms of numbers and competition , " Marson later admitted , " it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this is a relative thing . Scholarship requirements are much more lax now than they were 20 years ago . In fact , admission criteria have nothing to do with scholarship . They are based on tests that do not test scholarship . In the state universities , it 's even worse . All you have to do in most of them is to breathe to gain admission . " <P> <P> By entrance exams that dodge scholarship . Schoolman Marson means " objective " tests that ignore the classics and seldom require an applicant to write a complete sentence . Says he : " The experts may come up with figures which say that the students are better scholars now than they were . But I do n't believe them . These figures are based on percentiles-on the student 's relative standing . " <P> Is Education Fun ? In his generation at Boston Latin , a public high school that has been one of the most respected secondary schools in the U.S. , Marson always practiced what he now preaches . His boys knew precisely what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and solid teaching in the fundamentals of composition and literature . Marson scoffed at curve-grading ( the clod-coddling marking system that is based on the class average ) , insisted that his boys measure up to definite levels . One bright boy who measured up : Composer Leonard Bernstein , who still talks of Marson 's lectures on English poetry . Says a Boston Latin colleague of Marson : " Phil never pretended education was fun or that there was any substitute for hard work . He was the ideal secondary-school teacher . " <P> At 65 , Self-Exile Marson is finding plenty to do away from his classroom . He is writing a book and a pamphlet expanding his attacks on the nation 's schools . This summer , as he has for the past three decades , Marson will run his boys ' camp in New Hampshire . But next fall , his critique of American education squarely on the record . Schoolmaster Marson hopes to be back in a classroom giving his fact-packed lectures on Shakespeare and syntax that so well prepared his Boston Latin boys for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
