In recent weeks British and U.S. diplomats in Czechoslovakia have had the uncomfortable feeling that they were being followed . Two weeks ago the Foreign Ministry proudly produced results : British Air Attach Group Captain Cedric Masterman and U.S. Air Attache Colonel D.E . Teberg , they said , had been " apprehended " in a " clearly demarcated forbidden military zone . " <P> In separate answering notes , the U.S. and British ambassadors told what really happened . One sunny afternoon Group Captain Masterman and Colonel Teberg , out for a picnic in the countryside , were driving along the main highway north of Prague in Masterman 's car . At a crossroads near Milovice they were stopped by a military policeman and directed to turn off down a side road that bordered on an airfield . About 500 yds. down the road , Masterman found his progress blocked by an army truck planted in the middle of the road . He stopped . Before he could turn around , another truck drove up close behind him , making any move impossible . Six soldiers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and officers pinned there , the Czechs briskly towed two twin-engined jets as close to the car as they could , then ran two tanks up close on the other side . Four photographers arrived . The blocking trucks were moved back , the gun-carrying guards retreated out of lens range , and the photographers then took photographs of the car against this " most studiously arranged background .
