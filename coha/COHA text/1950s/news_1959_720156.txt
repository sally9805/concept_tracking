txt The House space committee said today the United States faced " national extinction " unless it undertook a " bold and dynamic " program to surpass the Soviet Union in the race into space . The committee said it appeared that the Soviet Union still had a " distinct lead " in space and questioned whether the Administration 's program was adequate to meet the " overwhelming " challenge posed by the dawning of the space age . , These unusually strong words of warning and concern were voiced by the Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration in its final report to Congress . The committee , headed by John W. McCormack of Massachusetts , House Democratic leader , was established last March to lay the legislative foundations for a national space program in the aftermath of the first Soviet satellites . The gravely worded report had particular significance in setting the tone of the forthcoming Congressional investigations of the Administration 's space programs to be conduct-. ed by newly established permanent space committees of tima House and the Senate . As expressed in the repot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States is faced with a challenge to national survival and must embark on an all-out space race with the Soviet Union . Within the Administration there is a contrasting attitude that the United States should not embark on a costly and presumed race with the Soviet Union The report , concurred in by both Republican and Democratic members ; cautioned against the budget approach for determining a national space program . " Budget pressures in the short run should not be the primary basis for decisions on space programs which are inherently long-range and which involve the very survival of the nation , " it said . While fiscal soundness is a worthy objective , the report said , " it is inevitable that certain expenditures on space must be made within the foreseeable . future and that dtlay will raise costs . " The report also contended that the large expenditures required in space exploration would be more than repaid in ten years from the benefits of such peaceful applications as communications and weather satellites . The committee did not specif y how much money should be spent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent that the members felt the present level of support was inadequate . The report said the latest Soviet achievement of sending a rocket into orbit around the sun had demonstrated that the scientific race with the Soviet Union " is serious and urgent and demands the utmost effort by this nation . " On the relative position of the United States and the Soviet Union in space exploration , the committee said , no clear-cut answer is possible , " but enough is known beyond all possible doubt to cause grave concern and to require positive action . " The report said it seemed likely that the Soviet " is still ahead of the United States " despite recent accomplishments and quoted estimates made by various officials that the United States was twelve to eighteen months behind the Soviet in space technology and that it would take at least five years to close the gap . However , the - committee raid that " enough progress has been made in 1958 to give us confidence that the United States and the free world are capable of mounting a successful space program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under way are bold enough in design , firm enough in execution and supported by a sound enough public understanding to insure the momentum required if we are to meet national needs anclto overtake and surpass the Soviet Union . " On this , the committee ex. pressed concern " whether the executive branch is driving home to the public the realities we face in a way which will create the broad-based support needed for carying on a national effort of the magnitude we require . " An effective national space program , it said , will " require the greatest partnership in the history of civilization and government . " " It can not be overemphasized that the survival of the free world  --  indeed , all the world ? is caught up in the stakes , " the committee said . " Only a bold and dynamic program employing the total talents and the greatest strength of the United States and its friends is corn . petent to meet challenge so overwhelming .
