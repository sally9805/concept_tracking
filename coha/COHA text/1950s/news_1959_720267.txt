txt ' The New York Central Railroad won in ' the Supreme Court today its long fight to abandon two passenger ferry lines across the Hudson River . The high court affirmed unanimously a lower court decision refusing to interfere with the I abandonment of the ferries . The lower court had been asked to make the Interstate Commerce Commission hold a full hearing on the case . Central ? officials said tonight that they planned to continue ferry service until the twentyfive-day period for a rehearing petition in the Supreme Court had run out . In the light of the unanimous ruling , however , such a petition would almost certainly be an empty formality . Yearly Loss Reported The Central 's ferry lines run from Weehawken , N. J. , to Forty-second Street and to Cortlandt Street in New York . They carry about 10,000 passengers a day . The railroad says it has been losing $1,400,000 a year on the operation . The ferries are the connecting link with New York City for passengers on the Central 's West Shore Line . Elimination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad 's efforts to drop all West Shore passenger service . The Supreme Court 's decision may have gloomy significance for railroad commuters generally , not just the West Shore riders . , The reason is that the ferry case is the first major test of a Congressional law intended to make it easier for railroads to get out of unprofitable passenger business . This provision was part of the Transportation Act of 1958 , Widened L C. C. Powers It gave the Interstate Commerce Commission clear authority for the first time to allow discontinuance of trains or ferries making up part of an in ' terstate line . Previously , the commission had jurisdiction only over the abandonment of entire lines . Furthermore , the 1958 act laid out a hurry-up procedure for dropping unprofitable operations . It provided that a railroad could give , up any service on thirty days ' notice unless the I. C. C. ordered an investigation . If the I. C. C. decided to investigate under the 1958 act , it could require service to continue during the inquiry for a maximum of four months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. decided to require continuation of the service , that // order would last for only one year . The legal battle over the ferries - began some . Years- before passage of the 1958aot . Iii 1957 the L C. C. authorized " discontinuation of the ferries Operated by the Central and also ; One 1'un by the Erie Railroad.l . But a ? hreeijude Federal ? District Court upset the I. C. C. decision later in 1957 . It held that the ferries were part of a railroad line and that the commission had no power to allow such a partial discontinuation of service . ? State Groups Took Action Immediately after passage of the 1958 act the railroads again . moved to drop ferry service .. The I. C. C. refused to order an investigation and issued an order allowing the service to end . Groups trying to preserve commuter service then took the case to the three-judge court again . Among them were the State of New* Jersey , communities in New York and New Jersey and the Citizens United Transit Committee of New Jersey . This time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. decision . It said that it could review only affirmative acts by the commission and that the failure to order a full investigation of the ferry abandonment was not reviewable . The Attorney General of New Jersey , David D. Furman , declared in his brief in the Supreme Court that the lower court decision endangered railroad passenger service everywhere in the country . That decision , he said , interpreted the Transportation Act of 1958 as giving permission to discontinue railroad service anywhere in the country , on thirty days ' notice , with no hearing before the I. C. C. and no right to judicial review . The lower court stayed its own decision and enjoined the abandonment of the New York Central ferries until the Supreme Court had acted on the case . That stay will presumably end  --  and the ferries die  --  after time for a rehearing petition has ended or the Supreme Court has disposed of such a petition . In a companion case , the lower court refused to delay the end of the Erie Ferry , and it has gone out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson  --  the Jersey Central , from Jersey City to Liberty Street , and the Lackawanna , from Hoboken to Barclay Street . Those railroads said today that they had no plans at present to seek a discontinuance of ferry service . The Central 's brief in the Supreme Court was submitted by former Gov . Thomas E. Dewey of New York. - Milton T. Lasher of Hackensack , N. J. , filed a brief for the communities and the transit committee . Month 's Delay Expected A spokesman for the New York Central said the ferry service would be discontinued when " the District Court injunction is no longer effective . " He said that would be after the appeal procedures had been completely exhausted by the opponents of the ferries ' discontinuance . " We will always give adequate notice before any change is made that affects our customers , " he added . It is not likely that the injunction against the railroad will be lifted in less than a month . The high court usually waits until the loser in such an action has had twenty-five days in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certified copy of its judgment to the district court .
