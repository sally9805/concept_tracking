One look at its own classified columns last week was enough to convince the Wall Street Journal that present tax laws are straight from Wonderland . " MILLION DOLLAR VALUE , " cried one ad . Up for sale was 75% interest in a company with " $200,000.00 in losses sustained in past three years available for carryover . . . " i.e. , for credit against future profits . Then the Journal noticed an ad for another company : " FEED MANUFACTURER . . . $3,000,000 yrly. gross . Excel . plant &; buildings appraised at over $500,000 . Long record of earnings . . . Full price less than $400,000 . " <P> The paradox of the profitable company being worth less than $400,000 , and one with steady losses being touted as a " million dollar value , " fascinated the Journal . " Almost any day now , " it said editorially , " we expect to see an ad like this . . . EXPERIENCED EXECUTIVE . Over past five years has successfully lost $100,000 on labor and material costs and reduced sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources over $375,000 . Available because I have done all I can with this company . Prefer company with conservative management needing shaking up . Substantial salary expected . . . "
