txt Those ' Cultural Exchanges ' When Premier Khrushchev was barnstorming about this country two months ago , he and his party made loud and frequent complaints about our State Department 's alleged sabotage of the program for cultural exchange between our two countries . So indignant did the Premier become on this subject that the warm welcome he received on the evening he arrived in San Francisco was marred by a Soviet press conference hurriedly called to release a statement denouncing the State Department on this matter . But last week-end it was announced that after only two weeks of negotiation in Moscow the United States and Soviet Governments had reached agreement on continuing and expanding for two more years the cultural exchange program begun in early 1958 . It is hard to view this result as anything but a fairly clear refutation of the heated charges the Khrushchev party made on this subject last September . We welcome the new agreement , as we did the original . But . it would be foolish to ignore the fact that even the expanded exchanges provided for 1960 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done if adequate and honest communication is to be established between the Soviet and American peoples . It will be good to be able to see the Moscow Art Theatre company here and we suspect Muscovites will enjoy seeing an American group play " My Fair Lady " in that city , but this and the other measures provided for are only a drop in the bucket . The basic barrier to full and adequate communication between our two peoples was spelled out here several times by Premier Khrushchev during his visit . It is the right asserted by the Soviet rulers to determine what and whom their people shall know and see . It is indicative of the Soviet leaders ' thinking that the chief of the Soviet exchange program , Yuri Zhukov , tried to write into the latest agreement a provision giving his Government the explicit right to select American performers going to the Soviet Union as well as to screen the ideas in all American magazines and books sent to that country . Why is the Soviet Government so afraid of letting its people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the world ? The Soviet regime , after all , boasts not only of its military power , but also of its " unshakable unity " with its people . The controlled and subservient Soviet press never tires of singing lyrically about the wonders of Soviet " democracy " and about the alleged love of the Soviet people for their Communist Government and leadership . Against this background the men in the Kremlin have only themselves to blame when we in the West come to some conclusion such as the following : The men in the Kremlin fear their people and fear for their power if the Soviet people really saw and knew the world in correct perspective rather than seeing it and knowing it through the distorting mirrors of the Soviet propaganda media . It is true that the sit:lation is better today than it was under Stalin . This last week the Soviet press has even printed speeches by Secrotary of State Herter and by former Secretary of State . Acheson . But these and other isolated and short-lived chinks in the Iron Curtain hould not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
