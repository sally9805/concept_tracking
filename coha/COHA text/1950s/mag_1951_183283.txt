Proceedings began with dignity , with Senators in clean tropical suits looking urbane and trading splendid compliments . But there was an occasional waspish exchange . One was set off by Michigan 's Senator Blair Moody , the newspaperman who succeeded Arthur Vandenberg . New , talkative and not yet hep to all the club customs , Moody triumphantly disclosed how a colleague had voted in a closed committee . Indiana 's Homer Capehart , Moody said , had raised his hand in favor of throwing out all wage and price controls . The outraged Capehart did not think it was necessary " to have persons snooping to see whether a Senator holds up his hand . I wish to say that I do not like such tactics , " sniffed Capehart . The incident was portentous . Before the week was out , sniffs had swelled into snorts of wrath , and rumpled , hollow-eyed and unshaven Senators were on a parliamentary rampage . <P> When the week began , the Senate had just six days to act before the expiration of the Defense Production Act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banking &; Currency Committee , would renew most of the President 's economic controls but strip away his crucial power to roll back prices , including the price of meat . A handful of Fair Dealing Democrats and like-minded Republicans fought to put back rollbacks . <P> " The Troubles He Has Had . " Most of the Senate was willing to gamble that inflation was no longer a threat , and that some of the President 's anti-inflation weapons had better be withdrawn . Georgia 's conservative Walter George said that rollbacks would " virtually stagnate business . " Senators on both sides of the aisle made it plain that they just did not think much of Harry Truman , and they would not trust his Administration with any more authority . <P> South Carolina 's Democrat Burnet Maybank , sponsor of the bill , did n't have anything against Price Stabilizer Michael Di Salle , he said . " I know the troubles he has had . . . But how do I know who is going to be in charge of prices next month , or month after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back prices to pre-Korean level was more White House power than Maybank was willing to put into law again . The Administration had had the power in the expiring act but had flubbed it . " The truth is , " said Maybank , " the Administration has failed to act . " <P> " One Man 's Price . " The best case for rollbacks was made by a Republican . Sure , said New York 's Irving Ives , for almost five months after passage of the act , the Truman Administration failed " with an incredible lack of courage " to freeze prices , much less roll them back . But the freeze , when it was imposed , said Ives , had left inequities between producers who had voluntarily held their prices down and producers who had calculatingly boosted their prices while they still could . <P> Ives thought that those inequities had to be corrected ( " One man 's price is another man 's cost " ) . Either some prices had to come down , or others would have to go up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiraling path of inflation . " But in the cloakrooms , Ives 's Republican colleagues vowed that no one would be able to make the Republicans the party of inflation . They would blame it all on Harry Truman ; they could just quote Democrat Maybank.
