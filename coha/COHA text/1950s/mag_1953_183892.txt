Out to see her new realm , and to be seen by it , Queen Elizabeth II last week paid her first queenly social call on Northern Ireland . In a green dress and tight-fitting hat , she drove into loyal Belfast ( pop . 450,000 ) to show herself to the 1,370,000 Northern Irish . <P> There were cheers from thousands , and Orangemen toasted their Queen 's coming in gallons of frothy stout , the national elixir . The Queen and husband Philip spent the night at Government House , watched the traditional lambeg drummers lambasting their three-foot drums with ferocious , stout-filled glee . Eventually , they gave Elizabeth a headache , and Sir Basil Brooke , Prime Minister of Northern Ireland , popped his head outside to ask them to desist . They did , but said goodnight by playfully clouting him with their caps . <P> That night , as Elizabeth slept , a band of Irish Republicans planted a gelignite bomb on the Dublin-Belfast railroad tracks , 40 miles south of Belfast .

Some sufferers : 600 southern Irish who had served in the British forces in World War II and who were journeying to Belfast to salute the Queen . Their excursion train was delayed . <P> Next day 5,000 troops guarded the streets of Belfast as Her Majesty rode to the Hall of Parliament to hear an ancient and loyal address .

Police shrugged off the explosion as an " accident , " but privately they were not so sure . Hundreds of armed men mounted guard along the 90-mile railroad line from Belfast to Londonderry . Their vigilance did not relax until Queen Elizabeth and consort stepped safely aboard their Viking and winged back to London .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
