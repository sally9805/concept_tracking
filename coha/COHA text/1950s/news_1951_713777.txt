txt The Economic Cooperation Adninistration is expected to wind Jp its Korean operation this month to make way for the United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency , which has inherited the mammoth job of trestoring the economy of this war-shattered country . Slightly more than $70,000,000 of ECA 's allocation for the current fiscal year remains unspent , but of this sum $25,000,000 already is allocated for purchase of desperately needed chemical fertilizer , cotton , timber , and other materials . It is considered likely that the unspent balance may be turned over by Congress to the new UN agency . Need for Funds Soars The new agency already has asked UN member nations to raise $250,000,000 as a starter , but this is only a fraction of what will have to be spent in South Korea alone if industry and communications are to be restored and the economy stabilized . After Seoul was occupied last September , it tentatively was estimated on the basis of a survey that it would take $6,000,000,000 to set South Korea to rights again . Since then , considerably more damage has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertilizers for this year 's all-important rice crop and res , toration of power plants at the earliest possible moment . At present , some operable plants are lying idle for lack of fuel . Priority on Fertilizer The fertilizer shortage is a serious problem . It was estimated that 700,000 tons would be needed this year , but it is unlikely that more than 100,000 tons will arrive in time for the 1951 crop . Orders were put in last year for the full amount . but they were canceled when military developments made it appear likely Pusan would be the only port open to Allied shipping . Under existing circumstances at that time , Pusan had to be kept open for strictly military purposes . Orders again are being placed , but to benefit this year 's crop , fertilizer should be on the ground by July at the latest . It is expected only a fraction of the total need can be procured and shipped by that time . Long-Range Program The United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency has not yet begun to function , although a representative already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with long-range planning and execution , leaving immediate relief work in the hands of other UN organization agencies . The latter agencies will round out operations by the end of this month , but their officials will remain until the end of the fiscal year , working with the United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency staff in order to make the transition as smooth as possible . ECA also will make available to the new organization the results of a detailed industrial survey made at the end of last year . A lot of this will be of little use , though , since much of the area involved in the survey has been fought over and destroyed . Early reports reaching here from the port of Inchon and from Seoul , where the South Koreans ' largest industrial complex is located , indicate that plants  --  particularly at Inchon  --  were not too severely damaged . However , it will be at least two months before power can be restored , even partially .                  @ @ @
