All were seen ( by their parents ) as extremely dependent on their mothers . They were spoken of as " Mama 's baby . " None showed ambition or independent attitudes in psychiatric interviews . But the older boys , who were able to verbalize their conflicts , occasionally expressed a wish for financial independence that would free them from parental control . All the children showed body tension . While on the surface they were passive and complacent , there was , in every case , an underlying and unexpressed aggression and overdependence on Mother , a feeling of inadequacy , and a tendency to withdraw from reality . Dr. Taboroff suspects that the incidence of ulcers in children is very much higher than is generally supposed . He urges pediatricians to make every effort to check young patients , both boys and girls ( ulcers affect the girls as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat their ulcers , and their emotional troubles , in the beginning , rather than in adulthood . Causes of Ulcers Other scientists have noticed that a faulty upbringing is behind most cases of adult ulcers . These people are apt to retain a childish dependency , and when in adult life they meet a complex situation , they are unable to cope with it . At the Langley-Porter Clinic of the University of California Medical School , Dr. Jurgen Ruesch , a psychiatrist , made a study of sixty-two men with peptic ulcers . All of them had been dominated or abused by one parent to the exclusion of the other , resulting in an unbalanced relationship with either the father or the mother . As children , these men had endured either affectionate overprotection or lack of love . " A normal child , " said Ruesch , " enjoys impartial supervision and less possessive love . " In need of love , affection , and security , some of the men remained attached ' to one or both parents into adult . life ; others transferred their ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an employer . A few went to the opposite extreme , and tried to deny their need for love . and .. affection . To prove their independence , they became social climbers , assumed ; heavy , ; responsibilities , identified themselves with their superiors , and behaved aggressively in business life . Running away from their need for dependence , they carried their restlessness with them , strove ceaselessly , and throughout life never relaxed because their ultimate goal was never reached . Of course , they developed ulcers . Identical traits were found in research into the lives of a group of male ulcer sufferers , conducted by scientists at the University of Cin-  | c innati . No matter how aggressive the men seemed to be , all had a desire to depend on someone else . Some of the patients were outwardly independent , hard-working and successful people ? following the accepted type of ulcer personality . But the behavior of these go-getters was only an excessive compensation for a deeply ingrained and repressed longing to rely on a stronger personality . A second group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy , and effeminate . Partly conscious of their immature longings , they openly depended on mother or wife , but at the same time , made a half-hearted effort to appear masculine and responsible . Sometimes this conflict was solved by illness , since ulcer flareups and anxiety go together . They accepted the painful attack with pleased resignation . " If I am sick , I can be dependent and no one will criticize me , " one ulcer patient admitted . Dr. Sidney A. Portis , an ulcer authority of Beverly Hills , California , holds similar views that the ulcer patient is a victim of a repressed infantile wish to be loved and cared for . " To a child , feeding and love become inseparable . . . . In early infancy this is a natural emotional state of a child . In later life , it must be suppressed because it is not harmonious with inter-dependent adult life , " said Dr. Portis .

It is not always easy , for instance , to distinguish between ulcers , gall bladder diseases , and appendicitis ? all have severe pain and all may have nausea and vomiting . However , it is never safe for a layman to try to diagnose these symptoms ; he must see a doctor . An ulcer is a raw sore in the inner lining of the duodenum , or the stomach . It ranges in size from about that of a dime in the duodenum to a quarter in the stomach . In appearance , it suggests a crater=a round hole with slightly raised edges . An ulcer is formed when the stomach starts digesting and the digestive juices " eat " a small hole in the stomach 's lining . Normally , the mucous lining is protected against the increased amount of digestive juices ; but sometimes the protection breaks down and an ulcer forms . The small raw spot is bathed in powerful stomach secretions , including hydrochloric acid ; and the ulcer becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a wide variety of foods and eating habits . Chronic abuse of the stomach with highly spiced and seasoned foods , greasy fried foods , foods too hot or too cold , and food that is not properly chewed , may start the ulcerous process . Alcohol and  | tobacco , especially cigarettes , play their part in the development of the painful sores . Hydrochloric acid stands out as an arch villain in the ulcer-drama ; in both stomach and duodenal ulcers , the stomach seems to manufacture large quantities of this strong corrosive acid . It appears then that an ulcer comes as a result of the stomach 's overactivity . The vital organ functions overtime , producing as much as ten times the amount of gastric juices produced in normal , nonulcer people . The stomach secretions also contain pepsin , the enzyme that breaks down food in the digestive tract and helps it to digest . The peptic or digestive ability of the stomach juices , therefore , has a lot to do with preventing an ulcer or curing it after it occurs . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ulcers have many symptoms . Most commonly , the patient complains of pain in the pit of the stomach , or just to the right of it , a few hours after food is eaten . The pain is described as dull , aching , gnawing , or burning ( heartburn ) , or sometimes simply as " hunger pain . " A glass of milk or a pinch of sodium bicarbonate usually brings relief for an hour or two . Then the pain comes back , often with such intensity that the ulcer victim is roused from his sleep around one o'clock in the morning . In many cases , the ulcer is so mild that the patient does not know he has one . Once or twice a year , he has a spell of what he calls " indigestion " or " dyspepsia , " or " something I ate " ; it lasts for a week or so , and then , after " home treatment " with light diet and doses of one of the popular " antiacids , " it disappears . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cured . " In some cases , the mild ulcer may be kept quiet for years with only occasional periods of distress when the patient encounters stress and strain . In others , the course is not so simple ; the ulcer grows deeper and larger ; it becomes red , angry , and painful . Then one of three things may happen : ( 1 ) the ulcer may penetrate , or " perforate , " through the wall of the stomach and the contents of the stomach or duodenum or both may spill into the peritoneal ( abdominal ) caviety . Then " perforation peritonitis , " a serious inflammation and infection develops . ( 2 ) The ulcer may penetrate a blood vessel and cause severe bleeding or even hemorrhage ; or ( 3 ) the ulcer may heal , or be " sealed " by nature , leaving a scar that blocks the food 's way through the narrow digestive passages . Only a few unlucky people have ulcers so chronic and painful that life becomes a burden . In many cases , the mild ulcer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical examination . In fact , hundreds of people have had ulcers at some point in their lives with-  | out knowing it ; they caused no pain and they disappeared without symptoms . Treatment for Ulcers : Diet and Drugs Diet will not cure an ulcer permanently . But it is one of the most important parts of ulcer management . In most consultations with ulcer patients the doctor starts off with : " Tell me what you eat .... " In successful ulcer treatment , the excessive flow of gastric acid must be neutralized or checked . In most cases , food and drink alter this abnormal flow . So ulcer specialists advise their patients to eat frequently , as many as six small meals a day , so that there will always be something for the gastric juices to work on besides the lining of his duodenum and stomach . Extra feedings should include milk and cream , which neutralize the stomach acids , and , in many cases , stop gnawing pains . The ulcer patient must avoid all foods that will irritate the stomach and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Coffee , tea , alcohol , in all forms , and tobacco are prohibited . So are fried foods , canned or smoked fish , raw fruits and vegetables , whole-grain cereals and bread , spices and condiments , such as pepper , mustard , and chili sauce . Instead , the ulcer patient must live on a soft bland diet of milk soups , strained and pureed vegetables and fruits , eggs , rice , noodles and macaroni , all plainly prepared without spiced sauces . From this , it would seem that the ulcer patient must reduce the pleasure of eating to a lifeless ritual . But his dietary fate need not be so bad as it sounds . The ulcer diet must contain all the ordinary nutritional requirements , and it can be made palatable . There are numerous excellent cookbooks , prepared to lift restrictions which sometimes produce a feeling of resentment and frustration in the ulcer patient . Eating becomes a worry , and worry generates hydrochloric acid , and hydrochloric acid starts new ulcers . One of the best of these books is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chief of gastroenterology at the Lahey Clinic , Boston , and Shelia Hibben of New York , a well-known food editor and writer . Mrs. Hibben , who is famous for her rich and savory recipes , wrote this book under strict restrictions laid down by Dr. Jordan . There could be no pork products ( other than overbroiled bacon ) ; no nuts , baked beans , clams , oily fish , hot breads , corn , cabbage , tomatoes , radishes , cucumbers , or pies , other than those baked with zwieback crusts . Everything had to be boiled , baked , broiled , or cooked over hot water . Fortunately , Dr. Jordan placed no ban on heavy cream , butter , cheese and sugar , so Mrs. Hibben used these ingredients with a lavish hand . Result : mouth-watering meals in the assorted recipes for ulcer  | patients . In this cookbook there are medically approved recipes for everything from lobster stew and chicken in cream to cheese cake , creme brule , meringue glacees , and bananas Melba . Menus are offered for patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress , those well on the way to recovery , and those who must watch their waistlines as well as their ulcers . The recipes will set any ulcer patient in a good mood by anticipation of a fine and medically safe meal . And , with slight additions , they can be enjoyed by the whole family , which means no more double cooking . Perhaps the most famous of all ulcer food programs is the Sippy Diet developed in 1915 by Dr. Bertram W. Sippy of Chicago . Dr. Sippy ordered milk and eight ounces of cream every hour , alternating with neutralizing alkaline powders consisting of calcium , sodium bicarbonate and magnesium oxide . The diet helped some ulcer patients ; in others , the alkaline powders caused alkalosis ( too much alkali ) , with dizziness , loss of weight , severe headaches , and , in some cases , kidney trouble . Since then , almost every kind of therapy has been tried out on ulcer patients , ranging from the removal of tonsils and dead teeth to curb infection , to tests to determine whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and eventually scientists went back to the idea that excessive stomach acids cause peptic ulcers . Anti-acid treatments have included aluminum preparations , aluminum hydroxide in powder and " gel " form , and aluminum phosphate , which neutralized the stomach 's acidity , and synthetic resins which apparently remove the acids of hydrochloric secretions and substitute a harmless sodium chloride , thus reducing the stomach 's acidity . Also , there is a group of ulcer drugs developed by Drs . David J. Sandweiss of Detroit and A. C. Ivy of Chicago ; they are enterogastrone , a substance extracted from the mucous lining of the upper intestinal tract of hogs , and uro-gastrone from urine , both of which seem to heal some ulcers and prevent their recurrence . The use of predigested proteins , as well as pure amino acids , which are protein-building blocks , is , in some cases , a simple and quick ulcer treatment . Originally reported by Dr. Co Tui of New York University College of Medicine , the practice of giving protein hydrolysates by mouth has become increasingly popular in treating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not digest their food . When the Washington University doctors made their observations on Doris B. , the woman with the " window hole in her stomach , " they checked the effect on her stomach of feeding beefsteak by vein . Doris 's stomach showed that the beefsteak feedings ( injections of solutions of predigested protein ) did not stimulate the gastric juices , but actually helped maintain the stomach 's normal resting activity . To make sure that the ulcer patient leads a calm life , his doctor  | usually prescribes sedatives for both day and night use . One of the most effective is phenobarbital , which quiets the nervous system , yet leaves the mind clear . In small doses , the drug is not harmful , but it must be taken under the doctor 's direction . The latest medicines for ulcers are the so-called " paralyzing drugs , " which actually paralyze parts of the nervous system which control stomach activities . This includes the vagus nerves , which run alongside the esophagus and fan out over the stomach . Paralyzing the vagus branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first of these drugs were belladonna and atropine sulfate . Newer paralyzers are Banthine ( G. D. Searle &; Company ) , Prantal ( The Schering Corporation ) ; and Pamine ( The Upjohn Company ) . All are powerful drugs which must be given under a doctor 's supervision . In some cases , they have rather unpleasant side effects , such as thirst , dizziness , poor vision , constipation , and urine retention . Pamine , the newest of these drugs which reduce the secretion of gastric acid in the stomach seems to be the least toxic of the group ; side effects are mild . Widespread investigations of the paralyzing drugs by many researchers show that thousands of ulcer sufferers have been benefited , and that in some advanced cases the patients have been able to avoid surgery . Ulcer Surgery The patient with mild , easily controlled ulcers does not have to resort to operations . But when ulcers fail to heal after a reasonable period of diet , rest and medicine , the doctor must consider surgery . Perforations , repeated hemorrhages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually treated this way . A ruptured ulcer is a surgical emergency , and an operation should be done immediately . With the new surgical techniques , blood plasma for shock and antibiotics for infection , the most delicate stomach surgery can now be done with little or no danger . When the surgeon opens up the patient 's abdomen , he will decide on what kind of operation to perform . One of the oldest and simplest is the gastroenterostomy ( gastro , stomach ; enterostomy , small intestine ) , in which a new opening is made between the stomach and the small intestine . In this way , the food by-passes the ulcerous spot and the sore is allowed to heal . Another is the subtotal or partial gastrectomy , in which the surgeon removes one-half or one-third of the stomach , to neutralize the gastric juices completely . A third operation for ulcers is the vagotomy , devised in 1943 by Dr. Lester R. Dragstedt of the University of Chicago . Since the relations between the emotions and the stomach had been clearly estab-  | lished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves which connect the stomach with the brain would reduce the corrosive stomach acids and so allow the ulcers to heal . The controversial " worry operation " has been used on hundreds of ulcer patients , with varying results . Some surgeons , among them Dr. Dragstedt , report 100 per cent success ; others report that cutting the vagus nerves does cut down the gastric secretions , and in this respect makes the patient feel better , but the side-effects are severe . The chief drawback to the vagotomy is this : severing the vagus nerves slows up digestive action , and , in some cases , food lies undigested in the patient 's stomach for about twenty-four hours , causing considerable discomfort . Also , ulcer recurrences after this kind of surgery are frequent . Now a group of surgeons at Duke University have decided that two operations for peptic ulcers are better than one . They are combining the vagotomy with the older operation , gastroenterostomy , making an artificial passage between the stomach and the small intestines to relieve the patient 's digestive discomfort . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role played by the vagus nerve in the formation of ulcers . This discovery also sparked the development of the nerve-paralyzing chemicals , Ban thine , Prantal , and Famine , which perform almost the same service as the vagotomy ? but without the knife . Research Meanwhile , Harvard researchers have carried on some experiments which may start a re-investigation of the current theories about the vagus nerve and peptic ulcers . The Harvard scientists are aware that the constant emotional turmoil of the ulcer patient stimulates the hypothalamus , the seat of the emotions . But at that point , they go further to say that the hypothalamus in turn excites the pituitary gland , the tiny , hazelnut-shaped gland at the base of the brain , which controls the growth of the body . The pituitary manufactures powerful hormones , among them ACTH ? adrenocorticotrophic hormone ? which stimulates the adrenal glands , the two hat-shaped glands located atop each kidney . The adrenals send out more powerful hormones , among them cortisone , which travel by the blood stream to distant organs of the body . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretion of gastric acid in the stomach , and thus cause peptic ulcers . This work bears out the theories of Dr. Hans Selye ? that under tremendous stress , the body responds with increased hormone output of the adrenal glands , which are known to cause , among other things , excessive gastric secretions . But the problem can not be put so simply . For one thing , ulcers develop in laboratory animals even when their  | adrenal glands have been removed . The use of cortisone ( the adrenal hormone ) and ACTH ( the pituitary extract ) in repeated doses may step up gastric secretion in some people , but the rate of peptic ulcers in patients treated with these hormone compounds does not seem excessively high . Nevertheless , the hormone-ulcer theory has opened up exciting new avenues of research , and several experiments are now going on to determine whether excessive gastric secretion is caused by the production of cortisone by the adrenal glands instead of by stimulation of the vagus nerves of patients with ulcers in the duodenum , as well as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ulcer is a much more serious problem than ulcer of the duodenum . Duodenal ulcers are almost never malignant ; in such cases , the doctor does not have to worry about cancer . But in diagnosing gastric ulcer , particularly in middle-aged men where this type most often occurs , he must seriously consider the possibility that what appears to be a stomach ulcer may be a stomach cancer , the second cause of cancer death in men . ( The first is lung cancer . ) With X-rays , fluoroscope and gastroscope ( a lighted bulb through which the physician can look into the stomach ) , the specialist can sometimes observe the gastric ulcer and say definitely whether it is malignant or benign . But no matter how skillful he is , he may be wrong in some cases . The only sure diagnosis can be made after surgery when the pathologist examines the ulcer under his microscope . After diagnosing a gastric ulcer , some conservative doctors are willing to treat the patient with medicine , watching the ulcer constantly to see whether it heals . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has what appears to be a gastric ulcer in the stomach . Dr. Alton Ochsner , distinguished surgeon of the Tulane University School of Medicine , New Orleans , insists upon radical surgery in all gastric ulcers . He believes that all stomach ulcers ( but not duodenal ulcers ) can become cancerous . Diagnostic techniques at best , he insists , are not good enough to make an accurate diagnosis of cancer in the early states when it can be treated successfully . By the time the malignancies appear in X-rays , it is too late . So , Dr. Ochsner contends , it is necessary to treat all gastric ulcers as though they were cancerous , and to remove most of the patient 's stomach . " The man over forty , who has never before had digestive trouble , who suddenly finds he does not like food particularly meat , and who loses ten to twenty pounds in a month or two , should suspect that his gastric ulcer is malignant , " said Dr. Ochsner . By adopting this plan of immediate surgical removal of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been able to double the five-year survival rate of stomach cancers . The late Dr. Frank Lahey of the Lahey Clinic , Boston , took the same radical approach toward gastric ulcers . " The figures for cancer of the stomach are so bad , and the mortality rate for gastrectomy stomach removal is so low , that I would like to operate on 100 per cent of gastric ulcers . In my opinion , it is impossible to know , without the pathologist 's examination , whether or not the ulcer is malignant . " How to Live with Ulcers Even if the gastric ulcer patient has to have his stomach removed , he can , in many cases , lead a nearly normal life . Scientists are making studies of special foods , containing concentrations of amino acids , carbohydrates , vitamins , and other supplements that will keep him from becoming a nutritional cripple . At the University of California , a surgeon , 1 ) r . I-I . J. McCorkle , has devised a new technique for stomach removal which may help the patient without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in this operation , surgeons bypass the duodenum , the section of the small intestine immediately below the stomach . But the California surgeon believes that the duodenum can be useful in helping to digest food . So he is connecting the esophagus ( gullet ) directly with the duodenum . In this way , the duodenum and the rest of the intestine can carry on the stomach 's normal task ; in fact , in many cases , this important organ is not missed at all . No matter what the treatment ? drugs , diet , or surgery ? ulcers are a chronic disease . The little crater-like sores go away , but they tend to come back . Even with excellent results from modern treatments , from 10 to 35 per cent of all ulcer patients have recurrences . Setbacks are commonly associated with fatigue , emotional stress , dietary indiscretions , or respiratory infections . Colds and sore throats in the spring and fall , the " ulcer seasons , " seem to aggravate the condition which originally caused the ulcers . This is disappointing news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his ailment . " The surgeon can cut out the ulcer , " observed Dr. Walter Alvarez , " but he ca n't cut out the tensions , the stormy thoughts , the troublesome wife , the annoying partner . Even with as much as nine-tenths of the stomach removed , the patient can soon get another one ulcer in the remaining tenth , or in the adjoining stretch of the intestine . " Surgery is useless unless the ulcer patient can change his way of living . In a " once-an-ulcer-patient , always-an-ulcer-patient " mood , Dr. Frank Lahey once laid down the law : " I am strongly of the opinion  | that any patient who has had either conservative or radical surgery for an ulcer should be told that the more accurately he adjusts his eating , drinking , and smoking habits for the lowering of gastric acidity , so much better will be his chance to avoid the forming of another ulcer . " Peace of mind is more important to the ulcer patient than drugs and diet . Since , in many cases , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the man is temperamentally unsuited , he may have to look for work that is less strenuous and more satisfying . Plenty of physical rest is needed . Occupations and recreations requiring constant bending forward are bad for ulcers , because the forward movement of the body puts pressure on the ulcer-bearing areas of the stomach and duodenum . The sores can not heal when there is a repeated flexing of the trunk . Six Practical Steps During the Second World War , the Army and Navy Air Forces prepared a list of instructions for the fliers who had ulcers . These practical suggestions should be of help to any ulcer sufferer in preventing a recurrence of the attacks : 1 . Keep food in the stomach . Eat slowly , regularly on time , every four or five hours . 2 . Drink liquids every hour between meals . A small cup of water or milk every thirty minutes is ideal . 3 . Sit up in your seat . Do n't sit with the body slumped and flexed forward . 4 . Do n't be muscularly tense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press the liver against the ulcer-area. 5 . Avoid shivering coldness . Keep comfortably warm day and night . 6 . Do not wear wide , tight belts , or corset-like clothes ; they , too , will press on the ulcer and prevent healing . Footnote  | Tuberculosis Tuberculosis can be prevented ; it can be cured . But before the disease is even suppressed , a patient may have to spend months or even years in hospitals and rest homes . If he grows discouraged and leaves before he is fully healed , he may be a source of infection to his family and friends and in danger of serious relapses . Besides adjusting to the slow process of treatment , he may have to be retrained for some new kind of employment before he can return to a useful and happy life . So tuberculosis is a chronic disease , ranking high in the group with heart disease , high blood pressure , arthritis , and other degenerative conditions , with costly medical and hospital expenses ( curing the average TB case costs about $15,000 ) , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attitudes toward TB Thanks to the intensive campaigns waged by health officers and voluntary organizations , tuberculosis is fairly well understood by nonprofessionals today . They know that this is a dangerous disease . But also they know that it has dropped to seventh place as a cause of death in the United States , whereas fifty years ago it held second place . TB death rates are notoriously high where standards of living are low . So well-fed , comfortably housed men and women have ceased to fear the disease . They forget that tuberculosis can strike any person , any time , any place . True , the death rate is higher among people of low economic status . Yet many wealthy folk through contact or improper living have had TB . The disease is most common in the city slums ; but it is also a serious health problem in many rural districts . All told , some 500,000 Americans have active TB , with about 115,000 new cases reported each year .

In the spring of 1819 , John Keats wrote : " Youth grows pale , and specter-thin , and dies . " Two years later , the frail , twenty-six-year-old poet was dead of this disease . Other famous sufferers were Elizabeth Barrett Browning , two of the three Bronte sisters , Robert Louis Stevenson , Balzac , Chopin , Thoreau , Cecil Rhodes , Shelley , Robert Burns , Stephen Crane , Schiller , Aubrey Beardsley , Heine , Goethe , Chekhov , and Dostoievsky . John Bunyan called tuberculosis " the captain of all men of death . " Other writers of novels , plays , biographies , and poems have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their times . Yet , because of the traditional association of tuberculosis with squalid living conditions , poor hygiene , and strain and overwork , many people today believe that the disease attacks only failures ? people who conspicuously have not made a success of life . Nothing could be further from the truth . TB strikes both men and women in all walks of life , the successful ones and the failures . But the death rate among men is twice as high as among women . Most of us have built up , through what we have read or heard , a vague impression that the tubercular person must travel far away to recover his health . This reaction may date back to childhood when the neighbor next door had to leave his home and family and take up a lonely existence in Colorado because he had " consumption .

The new patient is surprised when his doctors tell him that he should go to a modern sanitorium or tuberculosis hospital on the outskirts of his own town , where he will be near his family and friends and not lonely among strangers . TB Is a Communicable Disease In some cases , tuberculosis seems to run in families . Because of the close contact in which family members live , involving danger of  | infection when any single member has tuberculosis , the disease is believed by many to be inherited . You do not inherit TB ; you are not born with it , any more than you are born with whooping cough or measles . But it is a highly communicable disease and , as such , causes more deaths than all other infectious diseases combined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a cause of death between the ages of fifteen and thirty-five ? the years when young people are being educated , preparing for the future , building homes , and starting their careers . History of TB The term " tuberculosis " was not used until 1840 . But the chronic , debilitating ailment known as phthisis , scrofula , hectic fever , and consumption , dates back 6,000 years to prehistoric man whose bones revealed tuberculosis of the spine . A century ago , when slum conditions were at their worst , the tuberculosis death rate approached 400 per 100,000 population per year in cities of Europe and North America ? about eighteen times the present American rate . When miserable families living in poor tenements grew ill and died of lung fever , consumption was no longer regarded as the " romantic " decline ; it was a revolting disease . By 1850 , tuberculosis reform was under way in both Europe and America . Campaigns were set up to wipe out filth and squalor , spitting in public places , and unguarded sneezing and coughing .

" The great White Plague may be but a memory in ten years , " declare some of the more optimistic researchers . Of course , it will not . While the death rate has been reduced 85 per cent in fifty years , the disease is still the first cause of death of more young people than is any other disease , and in non-whites , it is the second cause of death ( heart disease first ) of all ages . There are between 10,000,000 and 20,000,000 sufferers from active tuberculosis in the world today ; it is the leading health problem in Asia and Latin America , and in many parts of Europe and Africa .

Koch himself thought he had it in tuberculin , a tubercle bacillus extract , reported in 1890 , which the great German researcher believed blocked the growth of the TB germ . But this was not true . Tuberculin was to prove useful in the tuberculin test for detecting present or past tuberculous infection when injected under the skin . But it was entirely useless in destroying the tubercle bacillus , one of medicine 's stubbornest enemies . Causes and Symptoms of TB Tuberculosis is caused by the tubercle bacillus , which is spread by people with active disease , usually through the air .

The patient will complain of fatigue , indigestion , night sweats , loss of appetite and weight , frequent colds , chronic cough and fever , and , finally , the telltale spitting up of blood . Kinds of TB Nine out of ten cases of tuberculosis in the United States affect the lungs . But the disease may involve the larynx , mouth , tonsils and trachea , either as a primary infection , or by spreading from the lungs .

In the hospital , he learns how to keep well and how to protect others . Furthermore , the better hospitals help to prepare the TB patient for a job when he returns home . It would be much simpler to plan hospital treatment for the tuberculous patient if only one kind of person got the disease . But the tubercle bacilli are not too selective in their choice of lungs . Rich and poor , stable and unstable , young and old , intelligent and unintelligent , all can develop TB . The meaning of this illness ? and the need for a strong , well-planned program of control ? will be different for each person , depending on his childhood , adolescence and adult experiences , his emotional stability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture patterns . The more chronic the illness , the greater the importance of these personal factors . As one wise doctor put it : " It is just as important to know what is in a man 's head as what is in his chest , if you want to predict the outcome of his pulmonary tuberculosis . " Help in Accepting Diagnosis and Treatment To be helpful , it is necessary for the doctor to understand the special kinds of problems the patient faces at diagnosis , during hospitalization , and when he is again reestablished in the outside world . Most of all , it is necessary to know the patient . What kind of person was he before he contracted the disease ? What are some of his fears , superstitions , prejudices , reactions to authority , and his ability to tolerate frustration ? What are some of the character-strengths that can be built upon during his treatment ? Whom can he count on during this difficult period ? Will his family be a source of emotional support , or will they hinder his progress ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he or she is away and attempt to find other interests ?  | Will the patient be constantly troubled by financial and family problems which he can do very little about , or will he be so protected during his illness that he will begin to feel that he is no longer a part of the family circle ? In most cases , the TB diagnosis comes as an enormous emotional shock . Some patients are so overcome that they do not understand a word the doctor or nurse tells them . Others try to repress all fears . Many have outbreaks of anger at the person who makes the diagnosis and refuse to believe it . Others think that they are being punished for their sins . Still others feel doomed . They will die anyway , they reason , so why bother going to the sanatorium ? It would seem that if a person is intelligent and well balanced , he would quietly accept the TB diagnosis and the need for hospitalization . Dr. Jerome Hartz , psychiatrist of Johns Hopkins Medical School , who has made an interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nurses , who should be expected to have a good understanding of the illness , often have the most difficult time adjusting to this diagnosis . " They have been taught the modern facts of tuberculosis in a clear , objective way , and should be expected to react reasonably and calmly , " said Dr. Hartz . " Yet some of the most irrational responses to the disease occur in this group . One soon detects that one reason they have become interested in medicine as a career is because , as individuals , they were often particularly anxious about health matters in their childhood . " Dr. Harry M. Wilmer , neuropsychiatrist at Stanford University School of Medicine , and author of Huber , the Tuber and This Is Your World , vividly describes his own experience with a TB diagnosis . " Nine years ago on a rainy , dismal tropical afternoon in Panama , a colleague sat at my bedside and told me I had tuberculosis . He was kindly , but through the mist of years , and the feeling of incredulity , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew I had been tagged ; suddenly , I had become ' it . ' I was told it meant a ' few months . ' Financial insecurity was here ; charity a possibility . I felt hopeless . There was a crushing feeling that I had been sandbagged . Although the events of the following years are blurred , one thread is woven through the entire fabric ? the whipcord of anxiety and depression . " A psychiatrist may have to handle severe depressions . But a great majority of the emotional problems arising in the hospital for tubercular patients do not require specialized psychiatric treatment . If the doctor , nurse , social workers , or vocational counselor can deal with the moderate emotional conflict without bringing a psychiatrist into the picture , the patient 's interests are not divided , and his confidence is boosted .  | TB " Types " To help these workers , an attempt has been made to break down the personality types and emotional problems of 300 interviewed tuberculous patients . About 39 per cent belonged to the markedly insecure type ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent were self-drivers ; 2 per cent , self-drivers in reverse ; 13 per cent , the conflict harassed type ; and 7 per cent were unclassifiable . Surprisingly , the rebellious patient may make the best and most lasting recovery . His attitude toward his disease is anger , a kind of slowburning resentment ? not a bit logical , but quite human . " In some patients , rebellion feeling is rapidly overcome or neutralized , " reports Holland Hudson , director of the Rehabilitation Service of the National Tuberculosis Association . " In some others , it persists for a long time . " At least , the recalcitrant patient usually brings his problems out in the open and the doctors , nurses , and social workers know where they stand . One remarkably rebellious patient was a thirty-year-old married woman , who was treated by the psychiatrist , Dr. Jerome Hartz . Her tuberculosis was actively progressing even after seven months of strict bed rest and her behavior was so unpleasant it antagonized everyone who treated her . The patient cursed at her doctors , threw things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With her hair cut short like a boy 's she was noticeably masculine in appearance . She was extremely restless ; her bed was usually in complete disarray from constant twisting and turning . Dr. Hartz learned that her mother and grandmother had been domineering , aggressive women , highly successful in fields usually reserved for men . Both women had married weak , passive husbands , whom they had left before very long . At nineteen , the patient repeated the pattern . She eloped with a charming alcoholic , bore him two children , and at twenty-one , divorced her husband . Taking both children , she started out to make her way in the world as her mother and grandmother had done . The economic depression of the thirties was in full swing , and the woman had a hard time providing for herself and the children , but her early experiences hardened her and she was determined to be self-sufficient . Five years before she contracted tuberculosis , she remarried , with the understanding that she would continue working and support herself and her children ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that she would keep her maiden name . Although she was often exhausted , that did not alter her fierce determination . Because of overwork and fatigue , tuberculosis symptoms developed and the woman was hospitalized . There her feeling of rebellion burst forth ; she could not accept the  | need to be dependent and to let someone else take care of her . Her whole life was devoted to proving how self-reliant and strong she was . She now found herself forced to jeer at and quarrel with the doctors and nurses who were unwittingly demanding that she give up her independence . Under psychotherapy , much of the woman 's feeling of loneliness , of being unloved , of deep pessimism came to the surface , and her restlessness began to subside . Gradually she began to look more feminine ; she let her hair grow ; she started to use lipstick . Her relations with the doctors and nurses improved , and she began to take an interest in the other patients . Also , her general condition became less alarming ; in six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a year , her sputum was negative and she was able to return home . This was a case of a severe neurotic reaction which completely blocked a rebellious patient 's ability to accept the required treatment for tuberculosis and to get well . The " Good Patient " Usually the TB specialists ' main concern is with the " good patient , " the one who lies quietly in bed for months , eats what is put before her , does not demand extra privileges or otherwise disturb the routine , but who shows little or no signs of recovery . Does the patient want to get well , or is she slowly waiting to die ? Marian E. Schmitz , a social worker in the field of tuberculosis , describes the case of a " good patient , " a woman , twenty-four years old , who had been in the hospital for thirteen months . She had a four-year-old illegitimate child , whom she struggled to support on an inadequate income . Her family had disowned her and assured her that no decent man would ever want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aunt , could not take the woman into her home when she was discharged because the aunt 's husband feared TB ; also she had been unable to send the patient money because of her husband 's meager earnings . The hospital was a refuge to the disturbed woman . Here she was understood , she was not criticized , she felt safe . When the time came for her discharge , she had a serious relapse . This patient needed help with a very real and practical problem , such as where she would live and how she would support her child . The whole hospital staff worked together to help her ; when she left the hospital , she had developed confidence in herself and was able to plan for the future . In every TB hospital , there is a small group of patients who manage to achieve some kind of emotional acceptance of their fate , but who remain chronically ill for years . These patients rarely leave the bed ; if they do get up , they are soon back in bed for many more months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  | they tend to be introverted , withdrawn people , who use their severe tuberculosis to guarantee care and affection for themselves . One patient finally admitted to a psychiatrist that she had been slowly committing suicide for the past nine years , but that none of her doctors had " caught on " yet . She seemed to be matching wits with the doctors , who for almost a decade had tried all the new drugs and a number of surgical treatments on her ? all of which had so far failed . For a long time stories have been circulated of the unnatural optimism and euphoria of tuberculosis patients . In some way they were supposed to have achieved an unrealistic calm that lifted them far above their ailment and its practical aspects . Modern doctors regard this as a romantic fallacy ; actually , most of them say there has never been any conclusive evidence in this direction . TB patients are not optimistic ; they are depressed , and have anxiety ? natural enough ? with their treatment and with their adjustment to the cure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuberculosis sanatorium has been tried out in group therapy . Patients with a common disease with common problems of psychic and physical adjustment , who face a common adjustment to hospital life for a year or more , meet and discuss their problems freely under the supervision of a psychiatrist or psychologist . In most cases , the patients do the talking , the leader contributes nothing more than a restatement of something that has been discussed , or a direct question which may reduce the anxiety , when indicated , of the group . To help these patients and their group leader , Dr. Harry M. Wilmer of Stanford , who was once a TB patient , has devised a poetic narrative , This Is Your World , which dramatizes the emotional problems facing the TB patient . It is a clever dialogue between patient and doctor , in sixteen separate episodes , to be used in group discussions with adult patients . It begins : " I am a doctor , I was once a sanatorium patient with tuberculosis . You can call me any man , or just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather be outside and free . Who would think you would have had Tuberculosis . Why me , you ask , and say the usual things : A terrible shock ! Or it could be worse . It 's all a mistake , I 'm all right . Did your father ,  | Did your Did your brother say , Cheer up ! Cheer up ! Not as bad as you think ? " The patient replied : " Yes , they did . A thousand times , yes . And then my friends , They came and told me : Are n't you the picture of health ! And poor me with all the bills and cares I have . They said : You 're lucky ! Things are terrible outside ! " This is an ingenious device for tactfully effecting some insight in the patients ' conflicts ; insight also is given the doctors and personnel who handle the patients . The unusual " ballad , " which has been published in book form , is also available in recordings , well transcribed . Specific Treatment for TB : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prevention and treatment of tuberculosis , bed rest remains the preferred treatment . Bed rest may be supplemented by drugs and surgery , or both , but first of all , the doctors must depend on the effect of rest treatment to build up the patient 's resistance for the long battle against the tubercle bacilli which survive in his tissues . Although the rest cure , either alone or when combined with drugs and surgery , has been effective in a great majority of cases , the time required has been long , often a year or more . Patients grow restless ; hospitals are overcrowded ; nurses and other workers are too few in number to handle the chronic cases . So in several institutions a new plan , which cuts down bed-rest time , has been tried out . One is a pilot program underway at the Sunmount , New York , Veterans Administration Tuberculosis Hospital . Patients who respond well to the anti-tuberculosis drugs are allowed to get out of bed , wear their own clothes instead of the traditional hospital bathrobe , walk about and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VA doctors report , generally do just as well up and about as when in bed , provided the drug treatment is continued faithfully ; many may even be able to stay at home during treatment . A similar program , set up by Drs . Sidney H. Dressler and Gardner Middlebrook of the National Jewish Hospital , Denver , Colorado , calls for fewer months lying in bed , but twice the average time spent in a TB hospital . Patients with no fever or other acute symptoms can  | get out of bed after eight to ten weeks ; but drugs have to be taken for nine to eighteen months while the patient remains in the hospital , to bring the disease under control . The idea of the Denver arrangement is to keep the patient under drug treatment while he slowly increases his activities and skills , so that he can be sent out safely for full-time work as " a whole man instead of only half a man . " If the reduced bed-rest plan could be accomplished , the obvious advantages would be great : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient 's morale would be improved , and he would not suffer the usual heavy social and economic losses . But so far , the " ambulatory treatment , " as the doctors call it , is of " debatable value . " " It is questionable whether these theoretical advantages can be achieved without paying the price of frequent relapses or long chronic disease , " I ) r . J. Burns Amberson , chief of the chest service at Bellevue Hospital , writes in Public Health Reports . " Almost every conceivable treatment of tuberculosis has been applied in the past to the ambulatory patient . The early favorable response frequently is deceptive , and the opportunity to bring about favorable recovery is easily lost . " In the opinion of the majority of American TB specialists , bed rest , plus the use of specific drugs , is the better way to suppress the tubercle bacillus and so halt the active , progressive disease . The drug most frequently used in treating tuberculosis is streptomycin , a soil mold , discovered in 1945 by Dr. Selman A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Streptomycin is not a cure for TB . Nor is its use always advisable . The principal drawbacks are its toxic side-effects ? vomiting , vertigo , and even loss of hearing , and the tendency of strains of tubercle bacilli to develop resistance to streptomycin ; when this happens the drug is no longer effective . To overcome these handicaps , streptomycin is usually given in combination with other drugs . The most frequent companion of streptomycin in combined therapy is PAS , or para-aminosalicylic acid , which seems to have the ability to delay the development of streptomycin resistance . PAS also seems to have therapeutic worth in its own right , and is sometimes used alone to treat tuberculosis . Streptomycin is a valuable aid in treating two types of tuberculosis ? tuberculosis meningitis and acute miliary tuberculosis , which were almost always fatal before streptomycin , but which now in a majority of the cases ? however not always ? respond to this drug . A new derivative of streptomycin ? dihydrostreptomycin ? made by the addition of a small amount of hydrogen to streptomycin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are now six other substances with proven merit as anti-tuberculosis drugs : These are PAS ; viomycin , an antibiotic discovered in 1950 ; diamino-diphenyl sulfone derivatives ;  | thiosemicarbazone derivatives ; pyrazinamide , and isonicotinic acid hydraside , now called isoniazid . In evaluating these drugs , Dr. H. Corwin Hinshaw , TB authority of Stanford University School of Medicine , emphasizes that none is the cure for TB . What is needed most , according to Dr. Hinshaw , is a nontoxic , bacteriocidal drug which will truly destroy , not just suppress , the tubercule bacillus . Since no drug has yet proved ideal for tuberculosis , the search for better drugs continues . And a drug treatment , quick and effective , is what TB patients want . Seldom before in the history of medicine has there been such unbridled optimism as that which came in the wake of the nationwide front-page publicity in February , 1951 , of the new isonicotinic acid drugs ? Rimifon , made by the Hoffman-La Roche , Inc. , of Nutley , New Jersey , and Nydrazid , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals and doctors in private practice were flooded with requests from patients and their relatives for supplies of the new " wonder drug . " Operations already planned to treat tuberculosis were delayed by patients who hoped that the new " pills " might be a better solution . There was talk of reducing the number of hospital beds given over to TB patients ; of converting crowded institutions to other uses ; even to postponing the erection of new , badly needed TB buildings . The drug manufacturers and the scientists who had done limited tests with the new drugs on patients were quick to warn that while the results of the compounds were highly encouraging , they had not then been used on enough patients for sufficient length of time to prove their worth . The drugs , pure synthetics which could be made cheaply from coal tar , were not particularly toxic when taken by mouth ; but their " staying power " had yet to be demonstrated . Tuberculosis experts wanted to know : would the TB germs resist these compounds in three or four months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments with the various forms of tuberculosis would tell . Since the spring of 1951 , the new drugs , now called more simply isoniazid , have been put through organized , large-scale clinical trials . While isoniazid is not the quick and easy way to defeat tuberculosis that the early reports promised , it has proved to be next in line to streptomycin in effectiveness , and , according to Dr. Ross L. McLean of the Veterans Administration , Washington , D.C. , in summing up the VA experiences with it , " a vast potential field of usefulness to be explored . " Five months after the start of the first large-scale study of isoniazid , there was evidence that this new drug was " an extremely effective anti-tuberculosis agent " for short-term therapy , at least . In twenty-two TB hospitals , the study was carried out to compare isoniazid alone ,  | isoniazid with streptomycin , and streptomycin with PAS . Improvement was found to be slightly greater in the streptomycin-isoniazid group than in the other two . But for long-term therapy , the streptomycin-PAS therapy appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Army Medical Corps on 1,500 TB patients , showed that a combination of streptomycin and isoniazid , given over six months ' time , made the best record of all the anti-TB drugs evaluated singly and in combination . This view is shared by the Tuberculosis Chemotherapy Trials Committee of the British Medical Research Council , which has suggested that the streptomycin-isoniazid combination may be the best anti-TB therapy now available . Because of the promise of this combination , the Charles Pfizer Company of Brooklyn , New York , have combined the two drugs in a single chemical , Streptohydrazid , which can be given by injection . The latest report on drug therapy for TB comes from a group of famous specialists who held a panel discussion at a meeting of the American Trudeau Society in May , 1953 . The members were : Dr. Walsh McDermott of New York-Cornell Medical Center , Dr. Nicholas D'Esopo of the Veterans Administration , Dr. John C. Jones , Los Angeles , 1 ) r . Ross L. McLean of Baltimore , William Steenken of the Trudeau ( New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver , and Dr. Guy Youmans of Chicago . The consensus of the panel discussion was that the use of two drugs is better than one ? specifically better than the streptomycin alone or isoniazid alone . The doctors seemed to think that streptomycin-PAS is definitely the first choice for prolonged tuberculosis therapy . Insofar as isoniazid was concerned , opinions were mixed , but the general belief was that , as a drug used alone , isoniazid was not the equivalent of the streptomycin-PAS combination for the long pull . Only through long-time trials will the knowledge of isoniazid 's best uses grow . Meantime , the American Trudeau Society warns : the new drug is neither a preventive nor a cure-all . Germ resistance to it exists . In other words , like streptomycin , isoniazid does not kill the tubercle bacillus in the body . The germ of tuberculosis remains a dangerous threat . It must be treated with rest , good food , hospitalization , and in some cases surgery . TB Surgery Like drugs , TB surgery is always an adjunct to bed rest , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple temporary collapse method to rest the lung , such as pneumothorax ( introducing air between the two layers , or linings of the pleural cavity : one layer lines the chest wall , the other covers the lungs ) , and thorocoplasty , the permanent collapse of the diseased area of the lung , induced by  | removing sections of the rib . This permits the muscles and other structures in that area to fall inward , thus relaxing the diseased part of the lung . New ribs will grow where the old ones were removed in such a way that the lung area will remain collapsed . This operation is usually performed in two or more stages . Other " collapse " methods are pneumoperitoneum ( collapse of the lung by introducing air into the abdominal cavity to push up the diaphragm ) , and extrapleural pneumothorax ( collapse of the lung by introducing air between the outer layer of the pleura and the chest wall ) . More radical types of lung surgery , which are being performed with greater safety every day because of improved surgical techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other drugs , are lobectomy ( removal of the entire lobe of the lung ) , segmental resection ( removal of a portion of the lobe ) , and pneumonectomy ( removal of an entire lung ) . Another surgical feat , called decortication , involves peeling off thickened membrane over the lung . Still another is the phrenic nerve crush , an operation to stop the action of the phrenic nerve in the neck , which controls the diaphragm , to reduce the motion of the lung . The nerve grows back in about six months , and if necessary , can be crushed again . This operation is sometimes called temporary phrenic paralysis . For permanent paralysis of the diaphragm , the phrenic nerve is cut . When renal tuberculosis affects only a part of the kidney , the diseased segment can be removed by surgery , just as can diseased portions of the lung , according to Dr. John K. Lattimer of the Squier Urological Clinic , Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons . Dr. Lattimer says that partial nephrectomy , as this operation is known , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be used only in selected cases where the active tuberculosis He favors a combination of streptomycin and PAS . Commenting on the value of lung surgery in the treatment of tuberculosis , Dr. Esmond R. Long , director of Medical Research of the National Tuberculosis Association , has said : " The rise of chest surgery in the treatment of tuberculosis has been in no small measure a triumph of a few men who were originally considered daring , if not foolhardy . . . later courageous . . . and , finally , sound thinkers and skillful operators . " TB in Children Another pioneer TB fighter is Dr. Edith Lincoln of Bellevue Hospital , New York , who has made a long-time study of tuberculosis in  | children . Fifty years ago , there was so much TB in the United States that doctors were constantly aware of the disease and on the alert for possible cases in all ages . But with the general decline in tuberculosis death rates , many pediatricians have been thrown off their guard against the danger of this disease in infants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kills approximately 1,500 children under the age of fifteen in the United States each year , and the majority of these are under two years . Specialists believe that much adult tuberculosis results from a reinfection within the body , rather than a fresh outside infection . So the time and extent of the first infection in childhood has a direct bearing on the course of adult tuberculosis . Dr. Lincoln urges the universal use of the tuberculin test ( injecting a small amount of extract from inactivated TB germs under the skin of the patient , or " scratching " it on the skin 's surface ) in all babies ; with the tuberculin test included in all routine examinations from birth through adolescence . " This type of follow-up of the well child as a means of early diagnosis of tuberculosis might help to prevent the tragedy of finding advanced tuberculosis on a first examination , " declares Dr. Lincoln . Tuberculosis infection in infancy occurs more often than might be expected . Out of one group of approximately 600 children seen at a ? well baby clinic ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired tuberculosis disease , as shown by a positive tuberculin test . Of the infected group , three-fourths became tuberculin-positive before two years of age , the rest before they reached the age of three . Follow-up of primary TB infection in children also is important , Dr. Lincoln emphasized . The pediatrician should watch particularly in the first year after infection for complications , such as tuberculous meningitis , which is responsible for the greatest number of deaths among boys and girls . Tuberculous meningitis , which attacks the meninges , or covering of the brain and spinal cord , is one of the most serious forms of TB . Although progress has been made in treating tuberculous meningitis with streptomycin and other drugs , it is still often a fatal disease . Young children who contract TB from an adult may frequently develop this type of disease , although it is also seen in adults . It may be a complication of pulmonary tuberculosis , spreading to the meninges from the lungs . Early symptoms of tuberculous meningitis do not seem particularly significant , and may not arouse suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever , and may have difficulty in feeding , with vomiting . Later the child may slip into a comatose , or semi-comatose , state . If he has convulsions , he may be fortunate , for the family will be shocked into action and a doctor will be called . About 75 per cent of the time , the adult from whom the child catches tuberculosis is in the immediate family . When tuberculosis meningitis is suspected in a  | child , but the diagnosis is not immediately certain , adult members of the family should be X-rayed . Examination of the family may not only uncover TB in the adult , but it may aid in the diagnosis of the child 's ailment . One child brought to a pediatrician had a father with only a slight " cigarette cough , " but when he was X-rayed , a huge cavity was found in his lung . His wife had tuberculous pneumonia . Neither of them had seen a physician . The child died of tuberculous meningitis within two weeks after diagnosis . Deaths among children with tuberculous meningitis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy . Just now , Dr. Lincoln is making a study of the use of isoniazid as a prevention of serious complications in children with a first infection . Later on , she hopes to make a study of a large number of young children with uncomplicated tuberculosis , to decide whether or not this more easily cured type of the disease should be treated with isoniazid . Detection and Modern Research This brings us back to detection of tuberculosis and early treatment . Doctors use a combination of three methods to find TB . 1 . The chest X-ray which gives a picture of the lung . 2 . The tuberculin test , which shows whether or not living TB germs are in the body . 3 . A thorough check-up , including medical history and laboratory tests . A chest X-ray , which reveals suspicious shadows in the lung , has become indispensable in diagnosing TB . Since the development of X-ray machines using miniature film , the search for unknown TB has been greatly speeded up and has resulted in the screening of large groups of people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taken in the United States during the year 1952 . When the small film shows signs suggesting lung damage , a larger film is taken ; if the diseased condition is still indicated , other tests are made before the final diagnosis . If every adult had a chest X-ray at least once a year , the unknown cases ? many do not even know they are ill , and are spreading TB to others as their own health grows worse ? would soon be located . Since the days of Robert Koch , scientists have hoped to find a specific preventive for tuberculosis , a vaccine that would create as complete an immunity to it as the cowpox virus does to smallpox . The most promising of the immunizing agents known today is BCG ( Bacillus Calmette-Guerin ) a vaccine made from a strain of live bovine tubercle bacilli , which has been cultured and recultured until it has lost its virulence .  | American health authorities agree that BCG vaccine , named for two French scientists , Albert Calmette and Camille Guerin of the Pasteur Institute , Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against tuberculosis germs , but whether it is enough to warrant routine use is in dispute . Although BCG has been widely used in the World Health Organization 's postwar campaigns against tuberculosis in Europe and other parts of the world , so far , the vaccine is used in the United States only for groups especially exposed or susceptible to the disease , such as nurses , doctors , and other hospital personnel ; American Indians , and some Puerto Rican school children . Strict rules govern the preparation and distribution of BCG . More than 15,000,000 people throughout the world have been vacvinated with BCG , with no evidence of return of TB virulence . BCG may one clay take its place as a practical vaccine against TB . Or a better vaccine may be developed . The search continues ; a vaccine has been made from tubercle bacilli killed by irradiation . Promising results have been reported in the use of irradiated vaccine in guinea pigs , but human tests have not yet been made . TB Control in U. S. Even though BCG or some other agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no relaxation in carrying out the accepted methods of tuberculosis control on a large scale . This is costing the United States more than $350,000,000 a year for expenditures by both public and private health agencies for the care of patients , case finding , public health nursing , health education , rehabilitation , treatment by private physicians , hospital maintenance , assistance to families when the wage earner is incapacitated by tuberculosis , medical research , and pensions to veterans . Not included are the cost of hospital construction or the tremendous cost of lost wages , lowered industrial production ? nor the tragic cost of homes broken up by tuberculosis . It robs the nation of approximately 1,000,000 working years ? lost by those who die from tuberculosis . Even the TB patients who are saved represent a serious loss in manpower while they are undergoing treatment , during convalescence , and after they are well enough to work again . In some cases , the failure to go back to work stems from the discouraged patient 's failure to take advantage of his opportunities ? he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know it . Early Rehabilitation : Bedside Therapy Ideally , rehabilitation of the tubercular patient begins with diagnosis . Very early in his hospital stay , he must learn to think in terms of re-  | conditioning himself after he is well . During the inactivity enforced by his illness , he needs attention and diversion , and , when practical , he should be guided into ways that might lead to future economic independence . This sort of therapy should begin at the bedside , under the direction of a trained **27;1823;TOOLONG therapist , who can plan and execute activities that will amuse and rehabilitate the patient , and at the same time , direct his interest into practical job-thinking . For training in one of the limited trades or occupations possible for people who are recovering from tuberculosis , he should have tests in aptitude , interest , and intelligence . Selected reading can start almost at once , bedside work will follow as his condition improves . During his hospital stay , training might be started in a number of occupations , such as watch repairing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typewriting , typewriter repair , radio repair , accounting , and drafting . Many patients who are too ill to learn a new occupation may do knitting , model making , fly-fish manufacture , soap carving , drawing , and other light and harmless activities within their physical limitations . They may also learn some of the crafts , such as leather work , weaving , or rag doll making . All these therapies help patients be more content with hospital life and able to look forward to a useful life . Vocational Training Programs Training in regular occupations begun in the sanitarium can be completed on the outside by the vocational training divisions of the state government . When he receives his medical discharge from the hospital , the patient is ready , in most cases , to return to normally active life . He is not a public menace ; when the doctor recommends his discharge he is healed , and he will not spread TB at home or in any place where he may work . Some activities may not be advisable for him ? he should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If his old job is now too hard for him , he will be helped by the hospital or the community rehabilitation service to find a substitute . Under wise counselling , the new job frequently turns out to be more satisfying and more remunerative than the former occupation . Each year through the efforts of the state-federal program of vocational guidance , thousands of men and women who have had tuberculosis are able to take jobs and to set themselves up as useful and selfsufficient citizens . They are proving to their employers that almost all of them not only can , but do , make good in a wide variety of jobs . So if you have had tuberculosis , you need not face the " insupportable labor of doing nothing " or waste your skills on jobs which do not  | give you a chance to do your best . With the help of the National Tuberculosis Association , a practical booklet , Opportunities for the Tuberculous , with a list of names and addresses of state offices , has been prepared by the office of vocational rehabilitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can be had for the asking . " You Can Lick TB " For ex-servicemen , veterans groups and other similar organizations are helping to meet this major rehabilitation problem . About 15 per cent of the veterans in VA hospitals have tuberculosis ? almost 17,000 patients . Only neuro-psychiatric illnesses account for more patients . For these veterans , there is an excellent VA pamphlet , You Can Lick TB . Since 1904 , when the modern campaign against TB began , the National Tuberculosis Association has been working on a program of better methods of case-finding , elaborate research to find new ways of treatment and to set up improved living standards . Not the least of the NTA activities has been the educational campaign waged by the association . Today , the NTA has affiliates in every state , the District of Columbia , Alaska , Hawaii , the Canal Zone , Guam , and Puerto Rico . The program of each association is geared to meet the needs of the area it serves . National , state , and local associations are governed by boards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members serving state associations , about 75 per cent are industrialists , executives , and other business people ; educators , lawyers , clergymen , housewives , farmers , and labor representatives . Of the 108 members of the NTA Board of Directors , sixty-three are physicians . Support for the work comes from the annual sale of Christmas Seals , conducted locally . The emblem of the fight against TB is the familiar double-barred cross , an adaptation of the Cross of Lorraine ? which appears on the Christmas Seals . Emily Bissell , of Wilmington , Delaware , led the first Christmas Seal campaign . She hoped to raise $300 to help treat eight patients . She raised $8,000 . And so it has gone on ever since . The NTA publishes a monthly bulletin and furnishes health columns for use in newspapers . For its affiliated associations , it is ready to supply more than 100 books and pamphlets on all aspects of TB . Also ready for the asking are some fifteen educational movie shorts , radio transcriptions and scripts of dramatic shows dealing with TB , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a dozen posters . Before her death in 1948 , Emily Bissell looked back over her long years of service for tuberculosis patients and said : " I see thousands who had no hope and have it now . " Today , TB workers have hope of a greater and even more practical kind . " The maintenance of a so-  | ciety free from tuberculosis is a possibility , " asserts NTA 's medical research director , Dr. Esmond R. Long . " Routine X-ray film examination will usually detect sources of contagion in time to exert protective measures to avoid spread of the disease . Vaccination may yet prove a practical procedure on a large scale . General hospitals must be prepared to give proper treatment to tuberculous cases wherever they are discovered , just as they may be required to treat any other communicable disease . Finally , society itself in a broad way must eliminate those social and environmental defects that have provided breeding grounds for tuberculosis in the past , and still delay progress . " Dr. Rene J. Dubos , internationally famous bacteriologist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long 's comment on the social aspect of this disease . In the book The White Plague ? Tuberculosis , Man and Society , which Dr. Dubos wrote with his wife , Jean , the scientist observed : " Tuberculosis is the consequence of gross defects in social organization and of errors in individual behavior . Man can eradicate it . . . by integrating biological wisdom with social technology in the management of everyday life . " The Rockefeller scientist recommends that the TB fight be carried out through two independent approaches : ( 1 ) by preventing the spread of bacilli through public health measures ; and ( 2 ) by increasing man 's physical resistance through a proper way of life . " The final step in the conquest of tuberculosis may well depend on knowledge of the factors that prevent silent infection from manifesting itself in the early stages of the disease , " Dr. Dubos concludes . The task ? of trying to recognize tuberculosis in its early stages ? is one on which Dr. Dubos and his staff are now working at the Rockefeller Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " allergy " has been fitted so neatly into our national lingo that now it turns up frequently in comicsupplement dialogue . But to the millions of sneezing , gasping , itching red-eyed men , women , and children , who either seasonally or the yeararound suffer from asthma , hay fever , hives , and eczema , there is nothing funny about an allergy . About one-tenth of the people in the United States are victims of these , the major allergic disturbances . Thousands more have minor allergies , such as contact dermatitis , food idiosyncrasies , and abnormal sensitivity to light , heat , and cold . And there are many others whose mysterious symptoms have never been diagnosed as allergies . Among the chronic conditions , an allergic ailment is perhaps the most persistently annoying and yet the least serious from the standpoint of permanent damage to health . A small number of people become total invalids because of an allergy ; others have to move from certain localities or change their occupations . But the large majority of victims of chronic forms of allergy simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asthma annual visitation in sodden misery , trying out new drugs ? pills , injections , or inhalants , visiting new doctors , and at last in desperation , escaping on a sea voyage , or to some spot in northern Canada that is said to be pollen-free . The sea voyage or the northern vacation will have to last until the first frost wilts the ragweed and other offending allergens , or the allergic one on returning home will start to sneeze , wheeze , and sniffle again . Then , miraculously , with a " killing frost , " the seasonal allergies disappear . And the patient finds that his uncomfortable and inconvenient seasonal hay fever and asthma have done no real damage to his nose , eyes , and bronchial tubes . Once developed , an allergy that is not treated usually lasts a lifetime . Only occasionally do the allergic symptoms disappear sponta-  | neously . When this happens , the patient may announce triumphantly : " I 've outgrown my asthma . " What usually happens is not so dramatic . More likely , the relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or other irritants which brought on his trouble in the first place . What " Allergy " Is The term " allergy " stems from two Greek words meaning " changed reaction . " This suggests that the allergic person reacts to contact ? either through the mouth , nose , or skin ? with certain substances in a way that is different from the response of normal people . Generally , his body tissues have greater sensitivity than those of the non-allergics . When he is exposed to offending allergens , his " changed reaction " reveals itself in characteristic symptoms ? red eyes , running nose , rashes , headaches , or abdominal distress . To most people , a glass of milk is an innocent and delicious drink . Yet in certain men , women , and even small babies , a small amount of milk in a cup custard or a cream soup may cause a severe rash , swollen eyes , or an asthmatic attack . These people may be otherwise healthy , energetic folk ; but they are , in the language of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allergy The fundamental cause of allergy was discovered in 1910 by a British physician , Sir Henry Dale , who later received the Nobel Prize for his work . According to Dr. Dale , the powerful body chemical , histamine , is the trigger that touches off the allergic attack . Irritated by offending pollen or food , histamine lights the fuse for an explosion of sneezing , wheezing , coughing , or itching . Science has not yet found an explanation of why certain people become hypersensitive to certain irritants . But it is believed that this reaction is due to some defect in the allergic person 's tissues which causes the production of too much histamine when in contact with allergic substances . Allergy Can be Controlled Lacking a scientific solution to the puzzle as to why he is one of the unfortunate hypersensitives , the allergic person must learn to live with his ailment . Like diabetes , an allergy is a chronic condition , and like diabetes , it can be controlled in about 75 per cent of the cases by injections or solutions containing the allergen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieve the symptoms . Times have changed since the day almost a century ago when Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes , a hay fever sufferer , told Henry Ward Beecher that the one sure cure for his allergy was " gravel . . . taken  | eight feet deep . " Now all over the country , in hospitals and research laboratories , allergy experts are collecting expert evidence which may one day mean prevention and cure of allergic diseases , instead of limited relief . But there is still a great deal to be learned . And to the weary and impatient allergy victim , who has spent time , money , and energy in trying to prevent or cure his annual or perennial discomfort , this knowledge seems a long time coming . Allergy is a fairly new medical field , and opinions differ as to diagnosis , treatment , and even the actual existence of this particular disorder . There are allergy-conscious specialists who lose no time in starting to test their patients for hypersensitivity ; there are others who are inclined to scoff at the " allergy fad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , sometimes do not think of an allergy as a possible cause of obscure symptoms . Some doctors claim that allergic reactions are psychosomatic , and that nervousness , tension , excitement , and emotional upsets bring on the skin swellings , bloodshot eyes , and asthma . Still others insist upon an elaborate program of testing in which various foods are eaten while the doctor watches the person 's reaction through temperature or pulse rate . Detection and Diagnosis of Allergies Very often , the presence of an allergy is revealed when the doctor is taking a case history . The specialist or family doctor will begin to suspect an allergy when he learns that the patient 's father suffered from severe asthma , and that two of his children get sick when they eat eggs and chocolate . For the tendency to develop some types of allergy is inherited . And the stronger the hereditary factor , the more likely it is that the child will develop some form of allergy . This does not mean that a woman who has asthma will have a child with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be transmitted to the child . If both parents are allergic , statistics show that 75 per cent of the children will inherit some form of sensitivity ; if the allergic history is on one side of the family , then 50 per cent of the children will inherit the tendency . The family history also influences the age at which the allergy will reveal itself in the child . Babies may develop eczema , the most common allergy in infanthood , in the first few months of life . More frequently , allergy symptoms start in childhood or adolescence ; they are not likely to appear for the first time in people past middle age . This hereditary tendency can not be prevented . All the allergic parent can do is watch for mild allergic symptoms , sneezing , inflamed eyes , running nose , or food idiosyncrasies in the children , and see that treatment is started at once . If exposure to a particular substance , which is troubling the allergic child ? pollen or food , is prevented for a long  | period of time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take four or five years to do this . But most allergists agree that complete avoidance of the offending inhalant or food offers a better chance of curing an allergy in young children than any other method . Hay Fever and Asthma Hay fever , the most common of all allergies , is named inaccurately . The condition is not caused by hay , and there is no fever . Its wellknown symptoms ? itching eyes , nose and roof of mouth , nasal obstruction , paroxysms of sneezing , inflamed eyes , and a watery nasal discharge ? are caused by the airborne pollens of various plants , especially ragweed and grasses . Occasionally , hay fever patients may have asthma , particularly toward the end of a heavy-pollen season in which they have not been treated for their allergies . Tree pollens are inhaled from March to May ; grass pollens , May to July ; and wood pollens , mainly from four varieties of ragweed , from the middle of August to the first frost . People may be allergic to one or any combination of the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some unfortunates who have hay fever symptoms from March through October . Ordinarily , the symptoms are worse on hot , sunny , windy days ; rains , on the other hand , may clear the air of pollen temporarily . Today , pollen counts are taken in most of the larger cities and results are published in the daily press . The count is made by exposing a microscopic slide covered with a mixture of mineral oil and petrolatum between two stainless steel disks in a spot that gets a maximum flow of all winds . In two locations , less than half a mile apart , the count may vary 50 per cent . The pollen can be carried by winds 30,000 feet up in the air , and it has traveled as much as 1,000 miles . Besides the seasonal allergies , there is a perennial , or year-around , hay fever which affects about 3 per cent of the population . The symptoms are the same ? continuous sneezing , stuffy nose , loss of smell , and watery discharges of the nose and eyes . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear at the first signs of frost . The patient says : " I seem to have one cold after another . " The uncomplicated cold should run its course in about a week . If it lasts longer , the patient should be tested for allergies . Chronic sinus infection shows almost the same symptoms as chronic hay fever , but after a skin test , the doctor can tell the difference . Causes of Hay Fever The commonest causes of all-season hay fever are the molds , dust , particularly house dust ; fur of dogs , cats , horses , and cows ; feathers of chickens , ducks , and geese ; and orris root , the base of almost all cos-  | metic powders . Sensitivity to food must also be considered in perennial hay fever , but it is relatively unimportant as compared to pollens and other inhaled substances . Testing and Treating Hay Fever and Asthma Next to completely avoiding the offending allergens ? obviously an impractical step in the great majority of cases ? the most effective way to control hay fever is desensitization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollen extracts spaced three to seven days apart , with each dose increased in strength to the point of tolerance . Treatment is begun long enough in advance of the hay fever season to make sure that the maximum dose can be tolerated before the symptoms start . Some doctors continue the shots on a once a month basis throughout the year . After a few years of this treatment , about 75 per cent of the hay fever sufferers get relief from their symptoms . Because his symptoms are lessened , the treated patient is less likely to develop asthma and other complications . Before desensitization is started , the hypersensitive person must undergo certain tests to find the offending substances . Skin tests are made in two ways : one , by putting the solution of an allergen on a little scratch on the skin ; and the other , by injecting a drop into the skin . If the patient is allergic to the particular pollen , symptoms appear in the form of red spots and rashes . Then there is the " patch test , " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cream , thought to be harmful is placed on an area of the skin , and covered by adhesive for an hour or two . If the patient is allergic to the substance , a red , sore spot appears . Another simple test to detect an allergen is the eye test . A small amount of extract is put into the corner of the eye . If the patient is allergic to the pollen extract , his eye will become red and itching . The pollen extracts most often used for testing hay fever victims are : trees : oak , birch , elm , poplar , hickory , ash , maple , and beech ; grasses : timothy ; and weeds : ragweed , plantain , and sorrel . But the allergic person may get symptoms from a number of other pollens , such as sagebrush , tumbleweed , marsh elder , hemp , cockleburr , and thistle . When an allergist announced solemnly : " You are allergic to mugwort , " a wide-eyed patient replied : " I 've never heard of mugwort . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a form of mug-wort , in his garden , and that mysterious pollen was contributing to his annual hay fever bout . As soon as the offending pollen or pollens ( usually there are several ) , are spotted , a special extract containing all the patient 's al-  | lergens is made , and the injections are arranged according to his particular needs . The pollen injections are harmless ; children as young as six years can be treated safely in this way . In some cases , reactions to the pollen extract injections do occur , usually meaning that the patient can not tolerate the size of the dose he has just received . When the pollen injection causes reactions , the patient is given a weaker solution of the extract , or the injections are stopped for a while . Each case is treated according to the patient 's requirements . During the season , the hay fever sufferer should not motor in the country ; he should avoid drafts , sudden changes of temperatures , and irritating smoke fumes . Special masks have been devised for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powerful blast of the allergens by which he is irritated . Small nasal filters which " screen out " the pollen bring relief to some wearers . For the hay fever victims who can afford them , the modern airconditioners are a boon . The machines filter the air of pollen and dust and , at the same time , bring down the temperature to a low degree that is soothing to the itching , sneezing , red-eyed sufferer . Unfortunately , few people can remain permanently in this agreeable aircooled and cleaned atmosphere , whether in the office or at home . If exposed to constantly changing temperatures , the allergic person will get very little relief in the pollen season . " The ideal state , " as one hay fever patient put it , " would be an air-cooled home , an air-cooled offic e , and an air-cooled automobile to take one to and fro . " In any case , the use of an air-cooling machine in the bedroom affords sound and comfortable sleep which may help the hay fever victim through his allergic days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim there is some kind of medicine that will give at least partial relief . For many years , adrenalin has been used as sprays , injections , and drops for allergic symptoms , particularly severe asthma . Ephedrine , a relative of adrenalin , but with less intense and more prolonged effects , also is used on the various forms of allergies . Both are helpful , but in some cases ephedrine causes palpitation , nausea , and nervousness . One of the best synthetic ephedrine nasal sprays is Privine , which gives prolonged relief to hay fever symptoms . Benzedrine inhalers are also helpful . Then there are the anti-histamine drugs . Ever since the discovery that this chemical , histamine , plays an important part in the production of allergic reactions , scientists have been trying to develop " anti-  | histamines " ? drugs that will overcome the effects of the histamine . About eight years ago , two of the best-known anti-histamines , Benadryl and Pyribenzamine , were made available to the allergic millions , under a doctor 's prescription . Benadryl and Pyribenzamine are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor 's order , they do , in most cases , bring quick if temporary relief by neutralizing excessive histamine . Also , the drugs help certain skin rashes , particularly acute urticaria , or hives . They are less successful in relieving asthma . Since the effect of the anti-histamine drugs lasts a brief time , the doctor usually prescribes them to be taken three times a day after meals . Since the arrival of Benadryl and Pyribenzamine , a score of other anti-histamines have been added to the list . Among them are Thephorin , Clortrimeton , Decapryn , Neohetramine , and others . All these drugs cause unpleasant side-effects : nausea , dizziness , sleepiness , stupor , and chills in some allergic people . One hay fever sufferer will say , " I can take Pyribenzamine ; I ca n't take Benadryl . " To another , Benadryl may be the drug of choice . The fact remains that any drug strong enough to neutralize histamine is so powerful that it must cause some side-effects . As yet , there is no ideal anti-histamine that will relieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug he thinks will be most effective for his individual patient and , at the same time , the least likely to bring on unpleasant reactions . Also , he will warn his anti-histamine takers against driving cars , flying planes , or working in factories , where sudden and overpowering drowsiness is dangerous . Hormone Treatment f or Asthma People with severe asthma get definite , if temporary , benefit from injections of the anti-arthritic hormones , ACTH , obtained from the pituitary gland , and cortisone , the adrenal gland extract . Some asthma patients have been made comfortable for weeks or months ; others have relapsed in a few days . ACTH in crystalline form has been given to asthmatic patients with considerable success , but they had to go to the hospital for treatment . In this form , the hormone is absorbed so quickly by the body that only small amounts can be injected at one time . Now Dr. Leslie N. Gay of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine is using ACTH in a gelatin solution , which slows down the absorption of ACTH by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shots can be given conveniently in the doctor 's office . Dr. Gay reports that ninety-five out of one hundred asthma patients treated once daily with an injection of ACTH in gelatin in the muscle responded quickly ? in four , six , or eight days ? depending on the severity of the disease . Some patients  | who had suffered from asthma for as long as fifty years were able to function " in complete comfort . " The patients ranged in age from three to eighty . In case of relapse , a second series of treatments gave quick relief . But care must be taken in administering ACTH and cortisone ; these hormone drugs also have severe and unpleasant side-effects , and they must be given by doctors who can make special tests of the patients while under treatment . Since anti-histamine drugs do not as a rule help asthmatics , cortisone and ACTH are of value in bringing immediate relief in severe attacks . Food Allergies Some hypersensitive people experience an allergic reaction as soon as they eat seafood , cantaloupes , tomatoes , strawberries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any other fresh fruit or vegetable . Others have weird digestive upsets when they eat eggs , milk , chocolate , or wheat . Yet many people have had food allergies for years without spotting the offending substance . Skin tests with foods do not always give accurate information . A patient may tell his doctor that he is allergic to chocolate ; yet when his skin is tested with chocolate , the result may be negative . One of the best detective means is a food diary , in which the patient records the foods consumed at each meal over a period of time . Then when he has an attack of hives or asthma , he can examine his food record to see what food was eaten just before the attack ( digestive upsets usually follow within a few hours after eating food to which the patient is sensitive ) . After a few food checks following attacks , the patient can start to avoid the particular food , such as eggs or wheat bread , eaten just before an upset came . If he skips an allergic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should eat the offending food again and again . After that , if he has allergic symptoms following the meal , he can be fairly sure that he has detected the food allergen . Besides the food diary test , there is the elimination test , which is particularly useful when the patient has constant allergic discomfort after meals . In this , the job of finding the offending foods is accomplished by ruling out a number of possible allergens . In its more drastic form , the elimination test calls for a complete fast of a couple of days ; then one suspected food is added to the diet every day or two , until the skin rashes , asthma , nausea , or headaches appear . Then the tests are repeated . In another kind of test , the patient eats in one day large quantities of some food , such as eggs , chocolate , or strawberries , which he suspects may be causing his trouble . If he shows signs of allergy , he is right . By a number of careful experiments , the allergy victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he is sensitive to eggs or wheat , he will have to substitute other foods . Bread can be made of the flour of rice , oats , soy , or potato . If he is allergic to milk , he can try one of several milk substitutes . If a patient is definitely allergic to certain foods , such as shellfish , coffee , cocoa , tobacco , or alcoholic beverages , he should avoid them in every form . Skin Allergies The number of allergic people who belong to the " touch and scratch " school are legion . They suffer from what the doctors call " allergic contact dermatitis , " which means that they develop rashes , hives , and other sores when their skin comes in contact with some irritant to which they are sensitive . The best-known example of this is poison ivy rash , which is due to a sensitivity to an oily material in the poison ivy plant . Early recognized symptoms ? redness , swelling , itching , and oozing blisters ? show up when the patient 's skin comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all age groups , from tiny infants who are as sensitive to their rubber panties as they are to their mother 's lipsticks to the aging women who contract ugly skin rashes when they use certain anti-wrinkle creams . Anyone is susceptible to this disease , whether or not he has a background of hay fever , asthma , or the other allergic disturbances . And once established , the tendency to allergic contact dermatitis is permanent . Outstanding symptoms are severe itching , fissures and cracks in the skin , profuse sweating in the affected areas , and burning , swelling , or oozing sores . Practically any substance which the skin touches directly can cause this trouble . The contact articles most frequently seen are : plants : poison ivy , ragweed and chrysanthemums ; dyes : black and brown in dresses and suits , leather goods , furs , and gloves ; toilet articles : soap , finger nail polish , hair-setting fluids , and hair lacquers ; metals : nickel and chromium ; woods : pine and cocobolo ; and among other materials , rubber , resins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . Interest in plant life , gardening and handling flowers offers a clue to spring allergic dermatitis . Irritation from rubber bathing caps , eruptions on the hands from golf clubs and tennis rackets are common in summer . Sores on the face from football helmets often occur in the late fall . An eruption which starts on Monday , washday , may involve soap and other laundry materials . On Fridays , many women prepare fish , causing severe hand rashes . Rashes that spring up before holidays point to a woman 's hair-do or a man 's haircut . On a special event , such as weddings and anniversaries , flowers and perfumes may he the source of the skin irritation . Dr. George Waldbott , a Detroit allergist ,  | who has written an excellent treatise on contact dermatitis , describes the plight of several newlywed couples who were forced to abandon their wedding journeys because the bridegrooms suffered severe " honeymoon dermatitis " from contact with the brides ' cosmetics . Contact allergens can be traced to habits , hobbies and occupations of the victims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , album hinges , and nickel tweezers ; in horseback riding enthusiasts , leather-polishing materials and those used in cleaning and disinfecting animals and stables ; in golfers , the leather and wood of clubs ; in hunters , gun oil and polishes ; in photographers , chemicals used to develop pictures ; in card players , plastic playing cards and table tops ; and in those who have pets , the animals ' hair and the substances used in their care . The nervous habits of certain people can cause severe contact eruptions . Allergists have noted the case of a woman who rubbed her wedding ring against her lower lip and set up a severe dermatitis because she was allergic to metal ; and of a man who scratched his scalp which had been treated with a hair pomade to which he was sensitive . The largest number of contact lesions are found on the hands , and here the most reliable clues are found in the typical patterns , such as the characteristic rashes of the salesman who handles leather shoes , and the farmer who milks cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car starter ; a radio pushbutton , or a light switch ; eruptions on the finger grip , furniture knobs , lipstick containers , rubber medicine droppers , or even the habit of picking up popcorn , peanuts , or olives , if the victim is allergic to these appetizers . Finger twist rashes come from turning keys , safe doors , or medicine bottle caps ; finger bands from nickel in rings , and from cream or soap lodged under the rings , or from winding dyed yarn ; finger cap trouble from thimbles , rubber finger cots , or from dipping the fingers into oils and chemicals . Eruptions inside the fingers can be traced to rotogravure newspapers and leather shoe laces ; palm lesions to metal knobs or soap dispensers , to toothpowder shaken into the hands , to telephone receivers , and to electric iron handles . Most allergists use the well-known " patch test " to determine , by skin irritation with an offending allergen , the cause of the eruption . Dr. Waldbott , on the other hand , has his own method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution , its size and location , and then determining the substance that is causing the trouble . " Cure of an allergic contact dermatitis depends largely on detection and removal of the cause , " he affirms . Special desensitization against the harmful substance is possible for a limited number of contact materials , such as poison ivy and ragweed . Painful sores can be soothed , dried , and healed with simple  | boric acid compounds . But above all , the allergic person with a contact dermatitis should not be put off with a diagnosis that his obscure skin ailment is caused by " nervousness , " said Dr. Waldbott . " A contact dermatitis is always due to contact with a sensitizing agent . And it is the physician 's job to track down the cause instead of referring the patient to a psychoanalyst . " Some patients are allergic to drugs , with full-blown symptoms of skin rash , sneezing , red eyes , and asthma that have nothing to do with the original ailment for which the drug was given . Often when a patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be traced to some new drug that he is receiving . Insulin , liver extract , the sulfa drugs , penicillin and other antibiotics , bromides , iodine , belladonna , and coal tar products may produce reactions in an allergic patient . " Physical " Allergies Topping the list of extreme sensitivity are the people with physical allergies ? sensitivity to heat , cold , and light . This source of allergy had not been detected until about twenty-five years ago when doctors began to report cases in which severe allergies , including giant hives and asthma , followed exposure to cold weather , hot weather , or bright sunshine . Also , there were cases of physical allergy by contact of the skin , mucous membrane of the mouth , nose or intestines , with heat , light , cold , injury or burns . Since then this strange phenomenon has become common medical knowledge . There are cases of physical allergy in which there is no evidence of pollen or food reactions ; in other cases , the physical allergy is combined with other specific sensitivities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot cook . stove or a fire , eat hot foods or take a hot bath . Those who are hypersensitive to cold may collapse while swimming in cold water . A number of these patients have trouble in swallowing , swelling of the mucous membrane of throat and nose , and abdominal cramping following drinks of cold liquids . Allergies produced by heat spread very rapidly , involving almost the entire body within a few seconds . Itching hives , nettle rash , and an eruption of red spots may appear as soon as the heat-allergic is exposed to a hot room , a hot bath , or even extreme hot weather . Treatment includes adrenalin injections in severe cases , or hot or cold applications , according to the condition . In allergies to heat , doctors try to desensitize the patient by exposing him to higher and higher temperatures over prolonged periods . In the same way , cold sensitivity is treated by immersion in baths of colder and colder tem-  | peratures . If desensitization fails , people who are allergic to heat or cold must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , the allergic worker becomes a major problem . Exposure to chemicals , furs , dyes , rubber , particularly petroleum products , leather , cosmetics , and many drugs may affect him so seriously that it will be necessary for him to seek other occupations . In some cases , preventive measures may be used , such as air circulation to get rid of the dust to which the worker is sensitive , compulsory showers , protective clothing and gloves . If the eruptions continue in spite of these measures , a change of job is indicated . Industrial physicians are constantly on the lookout for new and obscure causes of allergic outbursts . In one instance , 80 per cent of the workers in a factory complained of skin eruptions . Studies revealed that a particular type of grass fiber bag ( known as the Bahia bag ) in which crude chocolate was shipped from South America was responsible for the sensitivity . In another case , some allergic workers reacted with severe symptoms to the wooden cases in which cocoa butter was shipped . Among the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wind instrument made of cocobolo wood . She developed a distressing skin eruption which cleared up when she substituted a maple flute . A large proportion of the skin rashes suffered by factory workers are caused by strong hand cleaners . In some cases , soothing ointments and creams are available for use after the abrasive preparations have cleansed the hands . Unfortunately , these , too , may be sensitizing substances . Antibiotic ointments , for instance , frequently made bad rashes worse . One industrial doctor reported a large group of cases of severe dermatitis due to overtreatment of minor abrasions with well-known skin sensitizers , such as butesin picrate , sulfa drugs , penicillin ointment , ammoniated mercury , nitrofurazone ointment , and mercurial antiseptics . Does Climate Affect Allergies ? Just as allergic men and women often are forced to change their occupations because of sensitivity of some kind , so do others feel that by making a permanent change of climate , they may escape their misery . But this does not always work . A hay fever victim with sensitivity to ragweed may flee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is equally sensitive to the sagebrush which abounds in that state . Before any permanent change is made , the patient should know the particular pollens to which he is sensitive , as well as the plants and  | molds , trees , weeds , and grasses which grow in the region to which he is moving . Allergic people who get their attacks from house dust , feathers , or dog dander will be just as uncomfortable in Nebraska as in Oregon , unless they learn the specific causes of their trouble and try to eliminate them . Most allergists are extremely reluctant to advise their patients to disrupt their way of life in their own community , sell their business and home , and leave friends of many years because some member of the family suffers from hay fever or asthma . The Allergic Child This is particularly true of the asthmatic child , whose suffering is so intense that the unhappy parents decide to pull up stakes and move to Colorado or Montana on the chance that the child will be able to lead a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moves his family to another part of the world , he should consult an experienced allergist to see if the child can not be cured at home . The doctor will make a complete survey of the child 's present home ? furniture , bedding , carpets , the food he eats and the medicine he is given , his pets , and , most thoroughly of all , his reaction to pollens common in the region in which he lives . The necessity of costly change of environment may be quickly eliminated if the doctor finds that the child is allergic to the dander of his pet cat . Not so very many years ago , it was not uncommon for the family doctor to dismiss a hypersensitive child patient with a chef rful : " Do n't worry . He 'll outgrow it . " Unfortunately , he seldom does ; if his symptoms remain untreated , he may continue to wheeze and sneeze until he develops more serious complications than the mild allergy shown at the time of the first consultation . Today , allergic symptoms are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put under treatment as soon as his condition is diagnosed . The first sign of an allergic state in children is a skin eruption , which may begin in the first few days of life . Eczema is the most common allergic condition , usually appearing in the first few months . It is more frequent in bottle-fed children ; the breast-fed child may not have eczema until he starts to eat solid foods . What he eats is the allergic young child 's most important source of sensitivity . Then , as he grows older , inhalants and pollens are the more common allergens . Symptoms of youngsters with this allergic condition are the same as those of adults ; they suffer from sneezing , coughing , inflamed eyes , nasal obstruction , and headaches . They are allergic to the same pollens of weeds , trees , and grasses as their elders . But in a great many cases , the allergies are not diagnosed until the child has gone through several seasons of misery . Small children sel-  | dom have more than four or five mild " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang on , never getting any worse , but not getting much better , parents and doctors should suspect an allergy . Instead , many children are treated repeatedly with penicillin and other antibiotics to relieve a supposed " cold " or " flu . " Some children are subjected to needless tonsillectomies in the hope that the trouble in the upper respiratory tract will be cured . The wise family doctor who notices a history of recurrences every spring or fall of the child 's " colds " will start allergic tests as soon as possible . Asthma frequently appears in the first two years of life . Many of these asthmatic children also have histories of skin rashes , followed by hay fever . Asthma may start with a stubborn cough of unknown cause which does not respond to ordinary treatment . When the youngster finally has an acute attack of asthma ? a terrifying experience in a young child ? it is not likely to be misdiagnosed . In treating the allergic child , the doctor takes a careful history , starting with possible allergies in his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reactions to newly introduced foods is made . Any seasonal variations of allergic symptoms are noted . The child 's behavior at play , at school , and at home are investigated carefully . Foods are the most important allergens in babies and young children . The most common offenders are potatoes , cow 's milk , eggs , wheat , fish , nuts , tomatoes , orange juice , and chocolate . Some colicky babies are allergic to cow 's milk , and after it is removed from their diet there is an improvement . Parents fear that the elimination of certain important foods from the allergic child 's diet will disturb his nutrition . If the right substitutes are included , they will have no cause to worry . If cereals are barred , the child may have mashed ripened bananas , or potatoes . Goat 's milk or a soy bean preparation may be substituted for cow 's milk . Since many babies are allergic to orange juice and have had to take synthetic Vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) , citrus fruit growers have now prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil of the rind and protein in the fruit seeds have been removed , thus eliminating the allergic sources . Other food manufacturers are preparing substitutes that will give the allergic child proper food balance and , at the same time , freedom from his ailments . The contact and inhalant allergens which most frequently bother the small child are animal danders , wool , feathers , kapok , and house dust . For these youngsters , doctors recommend an " allergy-free nursery " in which there are no feather pillows , cotton lints , stuffed toys , and upholstered furniture . Instead , there are wooden , metal or plastic beds , chairs and tables , furniture covered with hard-finished textiles , cotton instead of woolen rugs , fiberglas pillows , rubber mat-  | tresses , and plastic toys . Of course , the child who is allergic to dog or cat fur should not have a pet in his home . The asthmatic child needs the care of a competent doctor and the help of intelligent and sympathetic parents . Many times the young victim develops a serious anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the noticeable anxiety of his mother and father . Symptoms are relieved considerably when the domestic upset is eliminated . In children and adults alike allergic symptoms should never be ignored ; they need immediate attention by a competent allergist . Selfmedication , or the advice of friends , may cost the hypersensitive person needless suffering . Results of medically approved treatments vary widely ; but in most cases symptoms can be controlled or relieved . The hypersensitive person of any age needs plenty of rest and exercise , well-planned meals , correct weight , fresh air and sunshine , and serenity of spirit . With the progress in treatment that is likely to be made in the next five to ten years , allergic conditions may one day be removed from the list of chronic diseases . Then when the weary hypersensitive asks the doctor , " Will I get well ? " the answer may be in the affirmative . The allergist may even have the answer to his next question : " When ? " Footnote  | Diseases of the Central Nervous System The central nervous system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly complex and integrated structure which controls , directly or indirectly , every function of the body . When it is affected by disease or injury , symptoms cover a wide range ? a simple headache , congenital disorders , such as cerebral palsy and hydrocephalus ( enlargement of a child 's head from increased volume of cerebrospinal fluid in the skull ) ; epilepsy , migraine , spina bifida ( a defect in the normal closing of the spine ) ; also infections of the brain and spinal cord , such as abscesses , herpes zoster ( shingles ) ; meningitis and encephalitis , poliomyelitis , and a long list of chronic and progressive sclerotic diseases , among them multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , the disease which killed Lou Gehrig , the baseball hero . Because of the complexity of the nervous system , basic research in its anatomy and pathology has lagged . In the United States , there are 4,500,000 deaf people ; 1,700,000 blind ; 300,000 with multiple sclerosis ; 1,500,000 with hemiplegia ( one-sided paralysis ) ; 1,000,000 with Parkinson Disease ( a chronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tremor ) ; 800,000 with epilepsy ; 100,000 with muscular dystrophy ; 250,000 with after-effects of poliomyelitis ; and countless thousands with wounds or accidental injuries to the brain and the spinal cord . The Central Nervous System The central nervous system includes the brain and the spinal cord . The brain is protected by the bony skull ; the cord , by the bony vertebrae . The brain occupies the large cavity of the skull 's interior . In the base of the skull are many openings , called foramina . Through a  | large opening , called the foramen magnum , the brain is continuous with the spinal cord . The vertebrae are irregularly shaped bones , joined to form a long , bony cylinder . Each vertebra has a heavy body from which a bony arch extends , enclosing a large opening . The vertebrae are so placed that these openings form a continuous channel called the spinal canal . In this canal lies the spinal cord , extending from the foramen magnum to the upper border of the second lumbar vertebra . Between the vertebrae are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blood vessels . There are seven cervical vertebrae in the neck ; twelve thoracic vertebrae in the chest ; five lumbar vertebrae for the abdomen ; and a sacrum for the pelvis . At the lower end of the spinal column is a small bone , the coccyx , which can be likened to the vestigial tail of evolutionary thought . The spinal column is held together by strong muscles and ligaments . The central nervous system is enveloped by a tough , whitish membrane called the dura mater ( hard mother ) . Immediately inside the dura mater is a complex web of small strands of connective tissue called the arachnoid ( spider web ) . In the communicating spaces between the strands ( called the subarachnoid space ) , there is a clear , watery cerebrospinal fluid , which , on examination , reveals the nature of many central nervous system disorders . The arachnoid strands connect below with a thin layer of connective tissue , the pia mater ( soft mother ) , which , in turn , adheres closely to the surface of the brain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the arachnoid , and the pia mater , are called the meninges . The brain is partially divided from front to back by a fissure into two corrugated cerebral hemispheres , lying side by side . Other depressions , some deep , some shallow , divide the two hemispheres into different portions , or lobes . They are the frontal lobes , the parietal lobes , the temporal lobes , and the occipital lobes . Each lobe has special functions , as yet only dimly understood by researchers in neurophysiology . The temporal lobes are concerned with hearing , speech , and smell ; the parietal lobes , with taste and touch sensations ; the occipital lobes evalute size , form , movement , and distances , to identify , by visual impression , some particular object . The frontal lobes facilitate the process of reason , and guide emotions and judgments . When disease or injury damages the frontal-lobes , there are definite personality changes . The two cerebral hemispheres are connected by bands of nerve tissues which cross the midline of the brain . The most prominent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posterior parts of the hemispheres and separated from them by a fissure , containing a transverse fold of dura mater , is a part of the brain known as the cerebellum ( little brain ) , which controls muscular co-  | ordination . The hemispheres ? frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes ? have a surface , or cortex , composed of gray matter . The hemispheres contain the lateral and third ventricles ( spaces or cavities in the interior of the brain filled with cerebrospinal fluid ) , as well as the internal masses of gray matter , known as the basal ganglia , which control primitive , or inherited , emotions . These ganglia are arranged in a group composed of the thalamus and hypothalamus , masses of gray matter at the base of the brain which send and receive fibers to the primary sensory areas of the cerebral cortex , as well as other brain structures . Photographs of the base of the human brain show many mysterious complexities . There is a stalk of tissue , extending from the base of the brain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the pituitary stalk , leading to the now familiar pituitary gland ( hypophysis ) which is contained within this bony cup , and controls growth . Here also are the rhinencephalon , or " smell brain , " the part of the cerebrum governing the reception of olfactory ( smell ) impulses ; the mesencephalon , or midbrain , which controls eye movements ; and the medulla oblongata ( oblong core ) , which , at the foramen magnum , is directly continuous with the spinal cord . The medulla , also called the " bulb , " is the part of the brain affected by bulbar polio , the most fatal form of that disease . Also at the base of the brain is the pons ( bridge ) , a convex white mass of fibers which receives impulses from the cerebral cortex and sends fibers to the opposite side of the cerebellum . The basal ganglia , the diencephalon , the mesencephalon , the pons , and the medulla oblongata make up the brain stem . The interior of the brain stem is composed of gray and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of white matter and a surface of gray matter , the same as the cerebrum . The spinal cord 's interior contains gray matter arranged like the letter " H , " surrounded by columns of white matter , the reverse of the architectural plan of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum . The spinal cord does not occupy the whole length of the spinal canal . It ends at the upper border of the second lumbar vertebra , but the meninges and the subarachnoid space continue to the bottom of the bony canal in the sacrum . Nor is the spinal cord uniform in character . In the cervical , lumbar , and sacral regions it is enlarged ; in the chest regions it is small . When the spinal cord ends in the lumbar region , the rest of the canal is occupied by a collection of nerve roots and blood vessels resembling a horse 's tail , which explains its name " cauda equina . " The central nervous system is connected with the rest of the body by nerves , extending from the spinal cord and the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain are called cranial  | nerves ; those arising from the spinal cord , spinal nerves . A nerve is a collection of nerve fibers , each fiber so small that it can not be seen with the naked eye , and thousands are necessary to form a nerve . Each fiber in a nerve is part of a cell unit of the nervous system known as a neuron . Its function is to conduct an impulse which may initiate activity , mainly muscular contractions , in non-nervous tissue . The impulses which go into the central nervous systems are called afferent ; those which leave , efferent . Nearly all nerves contain both afferent and efferent fibers . Cranial Nerves Entering and leaving the brain base are twelve pairs of cranial nerves , which have complex relations with the cranial , cervical , thoracic , and abdominal structures of the body . In examining patients with neurological disorders , the specialists try to spot the location of the trouble , either at the peripheral nerve , spinal cord , or cerebral level . The first cranial nerve , known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membrane of the upper part of the nasal cavity and ends in the olfactory bull ) . The first cranial nerve is associated with the sense of smell , and olfactory disturbances may follow injury in this area . The olfactory nerve and bulb may be involved in syphilitic or tuberculous meningitis , and in polyneuritis , an inflammatory disease of the peripheral nerves . The olfactory nerve may be lacerated by head injuries ; the olfactory bulb may be compressed by brain tumors or aneurysms ( dilated cerebral blood vessels ) , with pain , pressure , and danger of rupture . The second nerve ( Optic Nerve ) begins in the retina of the eye , and prompt examination of this nerve is of major importance in neurological diagnoses . Since the optic nerve is a direct outpouching of the embryonic brain , it will often give a reliable clue to cerebral diseases . This is particularly true of patients with tumors or abscesses of the brain , where an increase in the intercranial pressure is revealed by a swelling of the optic disk ? a condition known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the visual field ; neurosyphilis , especially paresis , may be followed by optic atrophy , due to neuritis of the optic nerve . The optic nerve is involved , in some degree , in three-fourths of the cases of multiple sclerosis . Another disease of the optic nerve is called retrobulbular neuritis . The optic nerve may be damaged by drugs and toxins , among them thallium , methyl alcohol , and tobacco . The third , fourth , and sixth cranial nerves ( Oculomotor , Trochlear , and Abducens Nerves ) control the delicate muscles of the eyes . When diabetes affects the cranial nerves , it is the sixth that is damaged . Diphtheria , on the other hand , often involves the third , or oculomotor ,  | nerve , which runs into the orbital cavity , where it ends in a number of muscles which attach to the eyeballs and move it in various directions . Myasthenia gravis and multiple sclerosis may be associated with ocular palsy . Infections in and about the face may also cause ocular palsy . In cerebral injuries and increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most commonly affected , with signs of ocular palsy . Aneurysms , accompanied by severe headaches , may involve the cranial nerves , most commonly the third , or oculomotor , nerve . The fifth nerve ( Trigeminal Nerve ) is best known for its association with trigeminal neuralgia ( Tic Douloureux ) , short attacks of intense pain in the course of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve . The cause is unknown , although infection of teeth , nose , and sinuses may play a part . Usually there is no sign of organic change in the nerve itself . Trigeminal neuralgia starts around the age of fifty , and affects women somewhat more often than men . Patients describe their attacks as " stabbing " or " lightning-like " pains , usually on one side of the face , although they may spread to the opposite side . Chewing , brushing the teeth , or washing the face , may act as " trigger mechanisms " to start the periods of excruciating pain . In the early stages , attacks rarely last more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or months , of complete relief . But as the disease progresses , the attacks increase in frequency , and the patient lives in constant dread . Medical treatments are of no permanent value , although trichloroethylene inhalations several times a day have helped a great many patients temporarily . Injections of alcohol into the cranial nerve branch at its exit from the skull may stop the pain for as long as eighteen months . Permanent relief can only be had by cutting the stump of the Gasserian ganglion ( the main ganglion of the trigeminal nerve ) , a delicate operation which is now handled so successfully that the eye damage , once feared , can be avoided . Of all the cranial nerves , the seventh nerve ( Facial Nerve ) , which controls the muscles of expression around the mouth , nose , eyes , forehead , and scalp , is the most vulnerable to injury , especially when there is a fracture at the base of the skull . Tumors of the parotid gland ( near the ear ) and surgery on the parotid gland , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage the seventh nerve . Pressure with forceps at the parotid gland level may cause facial palsy in a newborn child . Any infection of the parotid gland , such as mumps , may cause facial palsy . Also , facial paralysis may develop during other neurological infections , such as acute meningitis , diphtheria , shingles , and poliomyelitis . In cases of multiple sclerosis , diabetes , and myasthenia gravis , the seventh nerve may be affected . The  | most common form of facial paralysis is known as Bell 's Palsy , with its familiar distortion . Cause of this paralysis of the facial muscles is unknown , but in some cases exposure to severe cold seems to start off an attack . Usually all the muscles on one side of the face are weakened or completely paralyzed , and , in most cases , there is a loss of taste in the part of the tongue on the paralyzed side . Most cases of Bell 's Palsy recover in three to six weeks with massage , electrical stimulation , and splinting of the weak facial muscles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cortisone injections have helped in the treatment of Bell 's Palsy . The eighth nerve ( Acoustic Nerve ) is associated with the sense of hearing and equilibrium , or balance . Symptoms of neurological diseases affecting this nerve consist of varying degrees of deafness , vertigo , tinnitus ( ringing in the ears ) , and disturbed equilibrium . Tumors in the groove between the pons and the cerebellum often involve this nerve at an early stage . The eighth nerve is often affected during acute or chronic infections of the meninges , the membrane covering the brain . It may also be damaged by drugs such as quinine , acetylsalicylic acid , and streptomycin . The eighth nerve is particularly involved in a condition known as Meniere 's Disease ( named for a French teacher of the deaf , who claimed it was a disease of the inner ear ten years before physiologists proved that the inner ear is the seat of equilibrium ) , with recurring attacks of vertigo , deafness , and ringing in the ears . The start of this disease is sudden : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop , and usually hearing loss is progressive . Between attacks the patient is well , except for mild attacks of giddiness . Rest in bed is the best treatment during an attack . Other forms of therapy are : nicotinic acid , histamine desensitization , a fat-free diet with ammonium chloride and potassium chloride . If medicine does not help , permanent relief from attacks of vertigo can only be assured by an operation called a labyrinthectomy , complete removal of the semi-circular canals of the ear , or cutting of the vestibular ( balance control ) part of the eighth cranial nerve . The ninth nerve ( Glossopharyngeal Nerve ) supplies the throat ( pharynx ) , the parotid gland , and the back of the tongue . The ninth nerve may be the site of a neuralgia , similar to trigeminal neuralgia , except for the location . Severe pain originates in and about the tonsils and shoots to the ear and throat . Cutting the glossopharyngeal nerve is the surgical treatment for this kind of neuralgia . The tenth nerve ( Vagus Nerve ) is a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest and abdomen ; it regulates swallowing and talking , and its action also slows the rate of the heartbeat and controls the movements of the stomach ( see Chapter VI ) . The vagus nerve is associated with diseases in which the patient is unable  | to talk , swallow , or breathe effectively , with inflammations , and with aneurysms of the aorta , the heart 's largest artery . The eleventh nerve ( Spinal Accessory Nerve ) supplies some of the muscles which turn the head ; it is more commonly affected by neck injuries than are the other cranial nerves . These muscles are often affected in progressive muscular dystrophy . The ninth , tenth , and eleventh nerves , either singly or in combination , may be involved in brain stem tumors , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , multiple sclerosis , diphtheria , and myasthenia gravis . The twelfth nerve ( Hypoglossal Nerve ) is responsible for the movements of the tongue , and it may figure in poliomyelitis , polyneuritis , multiple sclerosis , and in some forms of meningitis . There may be damage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When both sides of the tongue are involved , the patient 's speech is seriously affected . Brain Tumors Of all the neurological disorders , brain tumors are most feared . Many people who are sure they have a brain tumor because they suffer from headaches , nervousness , and slight dizziness can stop worrying . Brain tumors are relatively rare ; for every one , there are thousands of men and women with mild central nervous system ailments which can be treated and cured . Twenty years ago a patient with a brain tumor was regarded as a hopeless case . Only a small number of the tumors could be accurately located within the brain , and if located and removed by surgery , the patient 's chances of surviving the operation were poor . Now the situation has changed . Practically every tumor of the brain can be located accurately ; and if the patient is operated upon , his chance to live is approximately 90 per cent . Brain tumors are divided into several types . They are : ( 1 ) Meningiomas , tumors in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do not invade the brain . They are more common in adult life than in childhood , and are more frequently found in women than in men . ( 2 ) Gliomas , composed of neurologlia cells , are divided into astrocytoma , a slow-growing tumor found in the cerebellar hemisphere in children and in the cerebral hemispheres in adults ; glioblastoma multiforme , the most malignant of the gliomas , a type most often found in the cerebral hemispheres of adults ; oligodendroglioma , a relatively rare , slow-growing tumor in the cerebral hemisphere of adults ; and medullablastoma , a rapidly growing glioma of childhood , involving the midline structure of the cerebellum , with early signs of increased intracranial pressure . ( 3 ) Pituitary tumors , which cause pronounced endocrine changes , such as gigantism in  | children , and acromegaly in adults , with its signs of bony overgrowth in the face , jaws , and hands . Pituitary tumors cause disturbances of the fields of vision by compressing the optic nerves . ( 4 ) Neurofibromas , which may arise on the sheath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the vestibular ( balance ) portion of the eighth cranial nerve . In this location , characteristic symptoms are ringing in the ears and loss of hearing . ( 5 ) Angiomas are congenital malformations of the blood vessels , most commonly found on the surface of the cerebral hemispheres ; and hemangioblastornas are true blood-vessel tumors found almost exclusively in the cerebellum . Finally there are the metastatic turnors . Tumors of any organs of the body may spread , or metastasize , to the brain , but the lungs and the breast are most often the origins of metastatic brain tumors . Development of symptoms is rapid , and the patient lives , after the symptoms appear , for only a short time . Occasionally , there will be brain symptoms of the tumor before the patient knows he has a tumor in the original site . Treatment of brain tumors is complete removal of the tumor by surgery . This is often possible with meningiomas , neurofibromas , hemangioblastomas , and pituitary tumors . In some of the more malignant tumors , surgical removal is not possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow up the growth of the tumor and give the patient several more years of useful life . The more optimistic outlook for the brain tumor patient has been brought on largely through the efforts of two great American neurosurgeons , the late Dr. Harvey Cushing and the late Dr. Walter Dandy . Before Dr. Cushing died in 1936 , at the age of seventy , his 2,000th brain tumor operation had been hailed by the profession at home and abroad . Yet in 1927 , when Dr. Cushing was surgery chief at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston , he offered this wise advice to a departing member of his service : Do n't imagine that you can learn everything about the surgery of intracranial tumors in a twelve-month period . . . . Almost every case brings up new problems or modifies one 's impressions of old ones presumably solved . Do n't rag the general practitioner for sending you cases too late . Endeavor to keep your mortality low . Above all , do n't fail in case of fatality to make your own post-mortem examination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the work . Dr. Cushing 's contribution was three-fold : first , a critical definition of the various symptoms produced by tumors in the different parts of the brain ; second , a better classification of tumors according to their structures and habits of growth ; and third , a refinement of surgical techniques so that the risk in brain tumor operations has been greatly  | reduced . Before Dr. Cushing began his work , the symptoms generally ascribed were headache , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , and paralysis ? symptoms which appear only in the late stages of untreated cases . 1 ) r . Cushing began to look for the earliest signs of the brain tumors , to study the sequence of symptoms , to divide the tumors into groups ? those which grew rapidly ; those which always grew slowly ; those which derived best results from surgery or from X-ray therapy . Dr. Dandy supplemented Dr. Cushing 's work with valuable contributions to X-ray diagnosis which enable almost every brain tumor to be accurately located . The usual X-ray pictures of the skull show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear cerebrospinal fluid which surrounds and bathes the brain is gently withdrawn through small openings in the skull and is replaced by air , this air will come to rest in the various depressions or wrinkles on the surface of the brain , and in the various cavities within it . X-rays taken while the air is over and within the brain clearly reveal the " wrinkles " on the surface and the cavities within . If a tumor is there , these characteristic patterns are altered ; often the actual outline of the tumor itself may be silhouetted on the X-ray film . Dr. Dandy 's process is called ventriculography . Tumors of the brain may produce symptoms limited to one of the special senses ? hearing , sight , smell ? for several years before they show signs commonly associated in the public 's mind with brain tumors . The pituitary tumor is a good example . This tumor , which occurs in any age group , originates from the pituitary gland , lying in a bony cup on the floor of the skull , an inch or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve , and not only reduces the clarity of vision , but also contracts the visual fields on each side . The person with a pituitary tumor can see only directly ahead ; this test alone may reveal the presence of the tumor . Another kind of tumor causes slowly progressive protrusion of one eye . This tumor lies behind the eye , and stimulates excessive growth in the bone adjacent to it . This thickening of the bone behind the eye pushes the eyeball forward . A simple X-ray examination will usually reveal this thickening and give a clue to the presence of the tumor of this type , which is benign , and can be completely removed with permanent cure if discovered early and treated correctly . Another common tumor arises from the auditory cranial nerve ? the nerve of hearing . A typical case of a middle-aged man is described by Dr. John E. Scarff , neurosurgeon of the Neurological Institute , Columbia University-Presbyterian Medical Center , New York . Four or five years ago , the man began to have a slight hissing noise in his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing in his right ear was not so good as it had been , and eventually he became totally deaf in this ear . Later , he noticed a slight numbness of the right side of  | his face , especially while shaving , so that he frequently cut himself . After that , he began to stagger slightly when walking , but still he did not seek medical advice . Finally , the man started to complain of headaches behind the right ear ; these increased in number and severity , and on some occasions were accompanied by vomiting . At this point , he went to a doctor , who confirmed complete deafness in the right ear , loss of sensation on the right side of the face , and some weakness of the muscles on the right side of the face . When the patient was asked to stand with his feet together and his eyes closed , he could not do it ; he fell toward the right . Examination of the retina of his eyes showed marked pressure on the optic nerves , indicating clearly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skull showed an erosion of the bones which house the inner ear . These , and additional signs , established the diagnosis of a tumor of the auditory nerve . Surgery was performed , the tumor was removed , and except for persistent deafness in the right ear , the man is free from symptoms and back at work . Tumors which start within the brain do not always produce such clear-cut symptoms . Nevertheless , they do give early signs of their presence . If a woman who has always been fastidious in her personal habits suddenly becomes slovenly ; or if a man who has always been exact in his business affairs becomes careless and irresponsible , these changes of personality should immediately raise suspicion of a tumor of the frontal lobes . If the patient develops weakness of one arm or leg without apparent cause , this should suggest a tumor somewhere in the motor area of the brain . A progressive speech difficulty , either hesitancy or stuttering , or temporary inability to speak , may be the earliest signs of a tumor in the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumors start in the cerebellum , or " little brain , " located at the back and base of the skull . This part of the brain coordinates all of the muscular activity in our more complicated movements . A tumor growing within the cerebellum will interfere with muscular coordination . It will cause a person to sway while standing , to stagger while walking , and to be clumsy in his hand movements . Difficulty in buttoning or unbuttoning , a tendency to drop dishes or eating utensils , a loss of skill in shuffling cards ? any of these may be the first sign of a tumor of the cerebellum . Cerebellar tumors are the most common tumors of childhood , and if a boy or girl who has been sure-footed should begin to stumble and fall without apparent cause , such a tumor should be suspected . A convulsion occurring for the first time in a grown person is always a symptom of neurological importance . Such a convulsion is invariably the result of a new , acquired disease causing irritation to the brain . A number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumor of the brain .  | Spinal Cord Tumors Spinal cord tumors are , in general , similar to those found within the brain . But the small amount of extra space in the spinal canal usually leads to the development of symptoms before the tumor reaches the size of those commonly seen in the brain . Spinal cord tumors produce symptoms by compressing the nerve roots or by interfering with the cord 's blood supply . At the tumor 's level , there are signs of compression , pain , localized weakness , and wasting of the muscles , and below the level of the tumor , there is evidence of damage to the long tracts of the spinal cord . X-rays of the spine and lumbar puncture are of first assistance in diagnosing the cord tumors . As in brain tumors , the ideal treatment of spinal cord tumors is complete surgical removal . Tumors which can not be removed may be arrested by radiation . Detection and Diagnosis of Organic Brain Diseases The actual diagnosis , and particularly the exact localization and treatment of a tumor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialty , which must be left to the neurologist or neurosurgeon trained in this field . But early recognition of the tumor , on which depends much of the success of its treatment , rests with the patient himself and with his family doctor . With modern techniques and instruments , scientists are learning more about the cause , nature , and control of these chronic and often fatal diseases . Radioactive phosphorus injected into the veins of patients , followed by use of the Geiger counter , helps locate brain tumors . The electroencephalograph , similar to the electrocardiograph for the heart , records the electrical potentialities of the brain in epilepsy , encephalitis , and head injuries ; the electromyograph registers the electrical potentialities of the muscles in brain and spinal cord conditions with abnormal movements of muscles , or where the muscle is wasted . By angiography , injecting radiopaque substances into the cerebral circulation , then taking X-rays , neurologists can diagnose intracranial tumors and aneurysms , or malformed cerebral blood vessels . By ventriculography , air is introduced into the ventricles ( cavities ) through openings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pneumoencephalography , the brain is X-rayed after the spinal fluid has been replaced by air or gas , injected through a needle in the subarachnoid space . At Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston , a new " positron , " technique for detecting and locating brain tumors without opening the skull , is used by Dr. William H. Sweet . Patients are injected with a  | mild dose of radioactive arsenic , and a supersensitive instrument called a scintillating counter is used to detect the special radiation from the positron-emitting isotopes . Brain tumors take ten times as much of the radioactive substance as normal brain tissue . As a detecting method , the scintillating counter is about fifty times as efficient as the standard Geiger counter . Besides mechanical devices , the neurologist uses a battery of psychological tests in the diagnosis of organic brain disease . And in every case , the patient 's own history is the most important diagnostic weapon . For instance , if he has a one-sided paralysis , the doctor may suspect that he has an injury in the opposite cerebral hemisphere , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke , a brain abscess , or brain wound requires a full history of the development of the symptoms , and more elaborate diagnostic procedures . Headache Is a Symptom , Not a Disease Headache is the most common complaint of patients with disorders of the nervous system , and other parts of the body as well . But in all cases , headache is a symptom , not a disease . It may be due to more than a hundred different causes . So for the neurologist to put his finger on one or more reasons for the painful , throbbing head may require his highest skill and techniques . Does the patient have acute headaches , chronic headaches , or recurrent headaches of varying degrees of severity ? What exactly is the location of the pain ? forehead , top of the skull , or back of the neck ? What time of the day does the headache occur ? Does it end suddenly , or is there gradual relief ? Is the headache worse after exercise , eating , or unusual stress ? Is it accompanied by nausea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbances , such as bright flashes of light before the eyes ? The brain substance itself is not sensitive to pain , but the brain coverings are ; so are the large veins ( venous sinuses ) and the arteries . Headaches may come from any of these pain-sensitive structures . The pain is produced by several mechanisms , or combinations of them . They are : ( 1 ) stretching or dilating the arteries inside or outside the head ; ( 2 ) tightening or drawing of the blood vessels within the skull ; ( 3 ) swelling and spasms of scalp and neck muscles ; ( 4 ) direct irritation of the pain-carrying nerves by inflammation or pressure ; and ( 5 ) psychogenic , or mentally produced pain , which has no organic origin . Very severe headaches accompany trigeminal neuralgia ; migraine or " sick headache " ; and inflammation within the cranium , such as meningitis , encephalitis , and brain abcess . Moderately severe headaches are usually associated with neuralgias of the scalp , including toothache , earache , and sinusitis ; with external  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinal puncture , with removal of spinal fluid . Mild headaches may be due to tumors of the brain ; eyestrain ; high blood pressure ; exposure to gases ; metal poisoning ; overindulgence in alcohol , food , tobacco , or drugs ; to tension ; and to the psychogenic pains for which there is no physical cause . The commonest cause for headache is irritation or inflammation of the nerves outside the skull . These disorders range in severity from the mild ache of the stiff neck , to the agonizing pain of trigeminal neuralgia , acute earache , or dying dental nerves . They may come from blocked sinuses , eye inflammation or strain , tonsillitis , or neuralgia of the neck and scalp muscles . Relief follows the removal of the original cause , but there may be painful sleepless hours until the reason for the headache is recognized . Migraine Migraine is probably the most elusive form of headache , and has baffled doctors for centuries . It usually begins in the early teens , and is more common in girls than in boys . Attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menopause . Migraine tends to run in families , and the incidence of both migraine and epilepsy in the same family is significantly high . Migraine victims are usually of the same type : people of high intelligence who demand perfection in an imperfect world . Hard-driving , ambitious business executives of both sexes often suffer from these attacks . It has three stages : ( 1 ) a warning , or " aura , " of the headache to come ; this may be depression , irritation , dizziness , ringing in the ears , and visual disturbances ; ( 2 ) the throbbing , usually one-sided headache , accompanied in most cases by nausea and vomiting ; ( 3 ) the steady , grinding , all-over pain , with tense and tender scalp . Untreated , the attack may last for hours or several days . The number varies from several a week to one or two a year . Between the migraine attacks , the patient has complete relief . Migraine headaches are often similar in symptoms to brain tumors , aneurysms , cerebral hemorrhages , and multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with migraine . So usually a careful neurological examination is made of chronic headache cases , with X-rays of the skull and electroencephalography , to rule out more serious disorders . All the specialists ? the allergist , the hormone expert , the circulatory disease doctor , the orthopedist who subjects his patient 's neck to traction , and the surgeon who performs brain artery-cutting operations ? have done their best to relieve the periodic attacks of agonizing pain of migraine ? man 's worst headache . At the same time , the psychiatrist  | has assumed that migraine is an individual misfortune , that most frequently it strikes the driving perfectionist who achieves his goal at the cost of a splitting head , and that it is most prevalent in periods of tension or conflict . Women have attacks after family quarrels or financial upsets ; men , during periods of concentrated business activity . When the migrainoid personality encounters unbearable frustration , the usual channels of expression fail him , and head pains follow . The migraine sufferer will tell you that fatigue and exhaustion are certain to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tense that he can not relax , he is susceptible to these seizures , and the inevitable usually happens . The aura appears as a curtain riser to the headache ; then comes the splitting , throbbing headache and perhaps nausea and vomiting . In some patients , migraine attacks have been connected with allergic sensitivity to certain food , particularly chocolate . For these people , elimination diets arc useful , and the antihistamine drugs may be tried ( see Chapter VIII ) . In others , headaches of this kind may be traced to eyestrain , and here the warning symptoms proclaim the need of careful eye examination . When migraine is definitely diagnosed , ergotamine tartrate and dihydroergotamine are the drugs of choice , and should be given as early in the attacks as possible , under a doctor 's supervision . Nicotinic acid often is effective in migraine cases . Besides providing the necessary medical relief , the doctor will help his patient adjust his life to reality . Learning to relax is one of the most important elements in his treatment . The migraine sufferer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants in life without destroying himself in the process . In the more stubborn cases , psychotherapy may be necessary to relieve the migraine patient of his feelings of insecurity , tension , inflexibility , perfectionism and resentment . Children with Migraine Working on this psychogenic theory , doctors now are trying to attack migraine at its source ? in young children . Symptoms in boys and girls are the usual ones found in adults ? periodic throbbing headaches , usually one-sided , often preceded by or associated with nausea , vomiting , visual disturbances , and mood changes . In a group of fifteen migraine children studied by Dr. Arnold P. Friedman of the Montefiore Headache Clinic , New York , eleven had some relative in the immediate family with severe headaches , and in six of these , migraine had been diagnosed . The outstanding feature seen in these youngsters was the presence of severe neuroses symptoms ; they were varied and dramatic . There were temper tantrums , frequent nightmares , hair-pulling , thumb-  | sucking , nail-biting , feeding difficulties , bed-wetting , hyperactivity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of twelve months ; now they occur every ten weeks with such regularity that her mother had future attacks marked on the calendar . They last three to four days , and in this time , the young girl is almost completely helpless . An only child , with a close relationship with her anxious mother , the patient has few friends and refuses to go out unless her mother accompanies her . Any frustration precipitates severe tantrums , in which the girl bangs her head against the floor . Mother and child are constantly battling , with the mother , sensitive to criticism , closing the windows during the quarrels , while the girl follows her around and opens them . In the study of this girl and others , the relationship between migraine headaches and emotional upsets was painfully apparent . Dr. Leo Kanner , director of the Children 's Psychiatric Clinic of Johns Hopkins University , has described migraine headaches as one of the psychiatric problems in his practice . There , too , emotional difficulties seem to start , aggravate , or increase the frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seem to be more common in girls than in boys ; usually the parents have records of " sick headaches . " The attacks may coincide with worry over failures in school . One child had migraine headaches as often as two or three times a month during the school period , when she was under a strain of having to do school work beyond her capacity under the direction of a nagging , unsympathetic teacher . During the summer holidays , the headaches vanished . When the girl was placed in an ungraded class under a more understanding instructor , her headaches were fewer in number , although they did not disappear entirely . Another Kanner migraine patient , a nine-year-old boy , had severe headaches over the left eye for three years , accompanied by nausea , loss of appetite , and vomiting . They happened every two weeks and lasted about twelve hours . " When he rises in the morning , he knows he is going to have a headache , " his mother said . The child had superior intelligence , but he was emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unhappy disposition , and was disposed to " worry and cry over everything . " His father had sinus trouble , was hard of hearing , and complained of ringing in his ears . His mother was nervous , flighty , and bothered by noise . She scolded the boy constantly , and contrasted him unfavorably with his younger brother . In children , as in grownups , treatment of migraine must be given not only during the attacks but in the intervals between them . Complete rest and no emotional excitement are stressed , together with a well-balanced diet , increased protein and limited carbohydrates . In all cases , the psychological difficulties which bring on and aggravate the attacks should be diagnosed and remedied  | Many psychiatrists believe that the migraine headache tendency can be reduced by a change in parental attitude toward sensitive , easily upset children . The parent who is too rigid and strict in discipline and training is the potential nemesis of a child who is oversensitive and emotionally unstable . Epilepsy Epilepsy , or " falling sickness , " as it is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in the state of consciousness , or , in some cases , loss of consciousness . The attacks are sudden and brief , and often they are accompanied by a convulsion , in which the patient falls to the floor or ground . Epilepsy follows three patterns : grand mal , petit mal and psychomotor attacks . In grand mal ( great sickness ) , about 50 per cent of the seizures start with an aura , or warning , with strange premonitions , visual disturbances , headache , and bizarre repetitive thoughts . It is the most common type of epileptic seizure . During a grand mal attack , the patient loses consciousness , his muscles tighten , and he falls . He may utter a cry , or groan , although he does not recall pain . Saliva froths at his lips . His face is dark red , then pale . He twitches violently for a couple of minutes , then lies relaxed . When he awakens , the patient is confused , dazed , drowsy , and complains of headaches and sore muscles . Frequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mal ( small illness ) , the patient rarely falls . Usually , there is a brief clouding of consciousness , lasting from one to thirty seconds , with a rhythmic twitching of the eyelids or eyebrows , and , in some cases , minor movements of the arms and legs . The attacks , most common in childhood , may come many times a day . In some children , they eventually disappear . The others ? perhaps one out of every three patients ? later develop grand mal . In the psychomotor attacks , there are disturbances of consciousness without convulsions . The patient does not fall to the ground unconscious ; instead , there is a period of amnesia lasting minutes to hours , during which he behaves in an automatic manner , usually contrary to his ordinary character . He may have a mild temper tantrum ; or he may behave in a wildly eccentric fashion . When the attack is over , usually he does not remember what has happened . Another kind of epilepsy , named after the neurologist who first identified it , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no convulsion , but there is a twitching of one leg or arm , or side of the face . To the neurologist , this means that the attack starts in a certain part of the brain ? opposite the side of the body in which the attack occurs . Perhaps a tumor or a scar is irritating the brain at that location .  | Epilepsy is divided into two types : idiopathic , in which there is no organic damage to the brain , and no physiological disturbance to cause the seizures ( about 75 per cent of all cases are of this type ) ; symptomatic , in which there is some known organic brain damage , such as tumor , abscesses , inflammation , or scar tissue following injury to the brain . Head injury at birth is one of the main causes of symptomatic epilepsy . Seizures may result from a head injury , or infection of the brain following diseases such as measles , meningitis , or whooping cough . Is Epilepsy Inherited ? Epilepsy itself is not inherited , but disturbances ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain , which are closely associated with epileptic seizures , are inherited , and have been seen in a large majority of the parents of epileptics . This suggests an inherited predisposition to epilepsy , which can be checked with an electroencephalograph . This EEG test shows that the brain wave patterns of most epileptics are different from those of most healthy people . Most of the seizures begin in childhood or adolescence , only about 30 per cent after the age of twenty . Boys are more often affected than girls . The majority of persons subject to seizures are in every other way perfectly normal human beings . Dr. William G. Lennox of Boston , noted epilepsy authority , studied the records of nearly 2,000 clinic and private patients , and found that the mentality of 67 per cent was average or above average ; of 23 per cent only slightly below average , and only 10 per cent were noticeably deficient in mentality . Some epileptics have exceptionally high IQ 's ; and many great historical figures ? such as Julius Caesar , Lord Byron , Swinburne the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Van Gogh ? had seizures . Fallacies About Epilepsy Epileptics do not die of their disease , although the chance of external or internal injury during an attack may reduce the life expectancy . But in spite of a well-planned program of public education , the belief still persists that epilepsy tends to get worse , and usually ends in mental decay . This is not true . The fact is that many epileptics get well spontaneously ; and the use of powerful anticonvulsant drugs in the hand &; of experienced doctors can rid still more victims of their seizures . In eight out of ten cases , with proper medical management , the epileptic can live a normal and useful life . Today , no epileptic need  | give up hope of having his seizures controlled . Modern doctors will tell him that the chance to manage his attacks is about as good as that of curing serious infections with penicillin , aureomycin , and other antibiotics . Treatment and Control of Epilepsy Physical defects , such as infections and glandular disturbances , can be corrected . Organic brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed surgically , when possible . Scars in the brain caused by birth injuries or accidental wounds can in many cases be corrected surgically . But the chief means of controlling epilepsy is medicine ? the right medicine for each person ? which in most cases will greatly lessen the number and severity of the attacks , and many times stop them entirely . For over fifty years bromides have been used to treat these attacks ; more recently doctors have prescribed phenobarbitol , the sedative , to cut down attacks . But the anticonvulsant drug , Dilantin , is far more effective than the earlier sedative compounds , and unlike them , does not produce drowsiness . For grand mal , Dilantin and phenobarbitol are the most effective medicines , either alone or in combination . Other effective medicines are Mesantoin , Mebaral , Paradione , Phenurone , and Mysoline . For petit mal , Tridione , is the best drug . Large doses of glutamic acid taken daily are occasionally effective . For psychomotor attacks , doctors use the same drugs as for grand mal , but in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petit mal , doctors now have a new drug , Milontin ( a succinimide chemical ) made by Parke , Davis &; Company . Trials of over 1,000 cases in the United States and Britain show that the drug gives complete control in 10 per cent , practical control in 40 per cent . About half of the patients get no benefit from the chemical . Lack of toxic effects , such as drowsiness , nausea and vertigo , are among the advantages of Milontin . New epilepsy drugs are now being tested at the Stanford University School of Medicine by Drs . Ralph W. Schaffarzick and Beverly J. Brown . The drugs are alcohols ? among them , 2-methyl-2-propanol , 2-methyl -2 , 4-pentanediol , 3-pentanol and 2-methyl-2-butanol . At the National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland , government scientists are trying a kind of surgery developed in recent years which has shown great promise in treating psychomotor epilepsy , which is much more difficult to treat with drugs than grand mal or petit mal . The operation now being performed in the NIH 's clinical research center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the brain ? the site of epileptic damage , and also believed to be the area which plays a major role in the normal process  | of memory . The operation consists of cutting away damaged brain tissue . By examining and analyzing the epileptic tissue cut from the brain , the scientists hope to determine the chemistry of an epileptic seizure , and perhaps develop improved drugs for combating or preventing these attacks . How to Live with Epilepsy The epileptic should have a good practical knowledge about his disorder so that he can work intelligently to cure himself . Two excellent books for lay leaders are New Light on Epilepsy and Migraine , by Dr. William G. Lennox , and Convulsive Seizures , by Dr. Tracy J. Putnam . As these two experts point out , the epileptic , with proper care , can go to school , work , marry , and even , in some cases , have children . " Some epileptics should not marry , " said Dr. Lennox . " Others , whose good genetic qualities more than outweigh the bad quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average , one offspring in thirty might have seizures , but only one in sixty might be chronic , and in most of these cases , the seizures should be controllable . " Epileptics , like other people , have a right to be hired for jobs on the basis of what they can do . There is no evidence that epileptic workmen have a higher accident rate than others . In a study of the physical and mental condition and occupational history of 1,000 adult epileptics , conducted by Dr. Lennox , it was found that about threefourths were both capable of work and were employed . They included doctors , lawyers , ministers , engineers , teachers , salesmen , farmers , clerks , laborers , mechanics , stenographers , dressmakers , reporters , interior decorators , factory workers , beauticians , actresses , dancers , writers , plumbers , and musicians . The National Epilepsy League , Chicago , Illinois , will advise all epileptics on their medical and rehabilitation problems . Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis is one of the most common disorders of the central nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whitish sheath surrounding the nerve fibers of the brain and the spinal cord ? begins to disintegrate and disappear . The precise function of the myelin tissue is not known , but it is believed that one of its most important purposes is to insulate or protect the nerve fibers which carry the nerve impulses to the muscles of the body . As the myelin sheath and the nerve fibers disintegrate , the space is replaced by patches of sclerotic ( scar ) tissue . When this damage occurs , the nerve impulses can not be transmitted with the full strength of a perfect nerve . As demyelinization process progresses and the scar tissue grows denser , the passage  | of the nerve impulses to the muscles , which normally activate the various parts of the body , is halted altogether . Multiple sclerosis , called " MS , " strikes in the prime of life , chiefly between the ages of twenty and forty . Symptoms are double vision , nystagmus ( involuntary movement of the eyeballs ) , tremor , weakness , difficulty in walking and balancing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble , and emotional disturbances . Often there are spontaneous remissions , with marked improvement in the patient 's condition . Later he usually suffers another attack , bringing on new symptoms , greater severity of the old ones , and , eventually , death . But except for the last stages , multiple sclerosis does not greatly incapacitate the patient ; in one large survey of patients who had had the disease for fifteen years , 43 per cent of them were able to walk about , and 34 per cent of them were working . The cause of this disease is not known . Viruses , infections , allergy , toxins such as metallic poisons , and damage to the arteries from abnormal blood dotting are now being investigated by several groups of researchers . This much they know : the disease is rare in warm climates . Statistics show that the incidence of multiple sclerosis is greater in the northern , colder climate of the United States above the 37th degree of latitude . Men and women are about equally affected . Early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized there may be a mild visual disturbance , slight stiffness of limb , minor trouble with walking , occasional dizziness , or vague difficulties with bladder control . The first signs of MS may be the same as early symptoms of other neurological conditions . On examination , increased activity of the deep muscle activities is found in about 90 per cent of the MS cases ; reduction or loss of abdominal reflexes in about 85 per cent . The seventh cranial nerve to the facial muscles may occasionally be affected ; and signs of vertigo and loss of hearing may also come from involvement of the eighth cranial nerve . MS patients do not experience much pain ; when they feel pain , usually it is the direct result of muscle spasm or of excessive muscle fatigue . Emotional changes are fairly typical ; the patient frequently shows optimism out of all proportion to his degree of disability . His emotions are poorly controlled and unstable , but his intelligence is almost always unimpaired . Psychoses are not a usual complication of multiple sclerosis . The disease is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it is not a mental disease . Research in Multiple Sclerosis Some scientists think of allergy as the cause of MS ; because a large number of patients have had an allergic sensitivity of some kind , and  | also because allergy disturbances in both human beings and animals can create a kind of damage to the brain and spinal cord , called allergic encephalomyelitis , which resembles the damage done by multiple sclerosis . Other research clues suggest that MS may be caused by some failure in the blood-clotting mechanism of the body . Scattered blood clots have been seen in acute cases of MS , and when scientists have experimentally obstructed the veins in laboratory animals to cause blood clots , scars occur on the spinal cord and brain somewhat similar to those seen in multiple sclerosis . Recently , Dr. Richard C. Fowler of the University of Rochester , Rochester , New York , has reported that a high level of cyanide , a common poison , is found in MS patients , but not in the blood of normal persons , or those suffering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the abnormal amount of cyanide may directly or indirectly attack the myelin sheath of the nerve fibers and destroy the nerve covering . The work of another MS researcher , Dr. Harold H. Jones of the H. L. Snyder Memorial , Winfield , Kansas , points to a metabolic disorder as the possible cause of MS . A total of over 4,000 lab tests made by this researcher indicate that there is a significant difference in the blood and urine of MS patients as compared with normal controls and patients with other chronic diseases . And Dr. Bruno W. Volk of the Jewish Sanitarium and Hospital for Chronic Diseases , Brooklyn , New York , has discovered significant protein changes in the blood of MS patients . Another significant theory is that MS is a disorder of the blood vessels , either a spasm of the vessels or a change in the tone of the blood-vessel walls . Since 1947 , Dr. Richard M. Brickner , neurologist , and Dr. C. R. Franklin , ophthalmologist , both of New York , have gathered convincing evidence that spasms in the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which receives images ) occur in MS patients . The appearance of the spasm coincides with the presence of blind or dark spots ( scotomas ) in the visual field . The treatment suggested by these scientists is to dilate or " flush " the blood vessels , thus relieving both the spasm and the accompanying scotomas . The doctors also feel that lesions in all parts of the body of the MS sufferer may be caused by similar spasms . Dr. Brickner has reported on a large group of patients with advanced multiple sclerosis whose acute symptoms have been helped by the use of fast-acting vasodilating drugs , such as amyl nitrite , nicotinic acid , histamine diphosphate , carbon dioxide , and papaverine hydrochloride . In no case does Dr. Brickner call vasodilation a " cure " for MS . At most , it is a palliative , giving relief particularly in the stages when new symptoms occur .  | In one interesting case , described by Dr. Brickner , a woman with chronic MS developed a severe tremor whenever she raised her arms to arrange her hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of amyl nitrite , the tremor was relieved . Other Brickner patients report improved vision and better coordination after treatment . Vasodilation therapy is both difficult and time-consuming . The MS patient must learn to recognize each new symptom , such as double vision or change in gait , as an emergency requiring immediate attention . The doctor in charge must determine the right drug for each person , the exact dosage , and how soon and for how long the patient is relieved . To Dr. Brickner , amyl nitrite , which can be carried in ampules and conveniently taken by the patient , is the best if it can be tolerated . Nicotinic acid is not so dependable , Dr. Brickner has found , and carbon dioxide is awkward to administer . Because of the mystery surrounding the cause of multiple sclerosis , physicians are likely to shrug off their patients with a " Sorry , nothing can be done " attitude . Nothing can be clone to cure the disease , but a great deal can he clone to prolong life and to give relief , even temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How to Live with Multiple Sclerosis The MS sufferer does not have to be alone . Since its founding in 1946 , the National Multiple Sclerosis Society has supported research projects at leading medical centers in an effort to find the cause and control of the disease . Also , the society is ready to answer all questions about MS , has literature available on the subject , and four times a year publishes AARMS Forward , which informs MS patients about recent developments in therapy and research . The government also plays an active role in fighting MS and other neurological diseases . The National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness of the USPHS , Bethesda , Maryland , is investigating MS and other demyelinating diseases . Meanwhile , the MS patient must depend on his own resources ? courage , persistence , and self-discipline ? and on the modern techniques of rehabilitation which offer the best means of controlling his physical disabilities . The National Multiple Sclerosis Society has three booklets , A Home Program for Patients Ambulatory with Aids , A Home Program for Independently Ambulatory Patients and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all prepared by Dr. Edward E. Gordon . These practical , clearly written pamphlets will give any MS patient the kind of advice he needs on the many aspects of his physical problems . Also a new illustrated booklet , The Psychological Aspect of MS ,  | by Dr. Molly Harrower , keyed to better mental health for the MS patient , has been published by the society and is now available to MS patients . Dr. Harrower , an expert in the field of clinical psychology and author of Appraising Personality , has studied 200 MS patients in different stages of the disease , and 310 controls , consisting of patients with other diseases , such as polio , as well as neurotic people and healthy individuals . According to Dr. Harrower : " The MS patient need never think of himself as being in the grip of uncontrollable forces which are going to introduce personality changes and deprive him of his inalienable right to be an individual or a personality . " However , certain psychological problems peculiar to his disease do arise : ( 1 ) difficult adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2 ) the uncertainties of the disease ; ( 3 ) the doctor-patient relationship in a disease where there is no known cure ; and ( 4 ) loss of control in certain physical ( bladder ) and psychological ( depressions and neurotic euphoria ) difficulties . Dr. Harrower 's tests on MS patients showed that there were no signs of unusual mental disturbance or intellectual impairment . One symptom which may turn up in later stages is faulty memory , particularly the inability to remember numbers . The booklet warns , however , that a certain amount of mental exercise is necessary to keep the intellectual equipment in good shape . MS patients have all types of personalities with wide individual differences , Dr. Harrower says . One characteristic common to many is a tendency to become overdependent psychologically on doctors or relatives , a trait which should be overcome . In her sympathetic booklet , the basic psychological needs of the MS patient are treated by the psychologist . This will give the patient a clearer understanding of himself and his problems and help him rebuild his personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the patient an understanding of his interests and vocational potentialities . The importance of hobbies and creative interests is stressed . Many MS patients are fighting their disability with gallant courage and hope . A forty-six-year-old Pennsylvania doctor , who has had MS for more than twenty years and is now practicing in a wheel chair , has treated 4,000 patients in the last five years . In addition to conducting a large practice , he writes fiction and contributes regularly to medical journals , although he can no longer write longhand or type . His advice to other MS patients : " Keep going as long as you possibly can . When you quit , you 're licked . "  | On the West Coast , there is a young minister , who despite being crippled in both legs , one requiring a brace , drives his clutchless car about 1,000 miles a month on diocesan business . A sixty-three-year-old woman , with MS for the last thirty years , lives alone and believes that her self-reliance has given her the vigor and persistence to fight her disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she has staged benefit dances in her community which netted a total of $5,000 for MS research and practical help to patients . Her most important advice to new MS patients is : " Be a doer , do n't be a done-for . " Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Another sclerotic disease , often confused by laymen with multiple sclerosis is arnyotrojhic lateral sclerosis , called ALS for short . This disease of the nervous system attacks around 2,500 persons in the United States each year . The victims ( more men than women ) are often between the ages of thirty and fifty-five , and the average person has three years to live after being attacked . No treatment is known . Like multiple sclerosis , ALS is a degenerative disease of the nervous system in which the fatty covering of the nerve fibers of brain and of spinal cord is damaged . There are two types of ALS : a slow progressive type , primarily paralyzing muscles of hands and arms but eventually affecting other parts of the body , too ; and a more rapidly progressive type where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pharynx are first involved and then paralyzed . In the second form , death by asphyxia or pneumonia usually occurs within two years . Since amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is known to be highly prevalent on the Pacific island of Guam , this location has been selected for research in a joint program by the United States Public Health Service , the Navy 's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery , the Department of the Interior , and the Government of Guam . While serving as a Navy doctor on Guam , Dr. Donald R. Koerner of Rochester , New York , found that ALS , known by the natives as lytico ( short for paralytico ) , had been known on Guam for generations . This finding , plus the fact that the Guam population is relatively fixed , gives the scientists a good chance to determine the possible roles of heredity and environment in the development of this disease . Dr. Leonard T. Kurland of the USPHS 's National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness will head the Guam study . Investigations , he hopes , will reveal whether ALS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exactly the same disorder as is known elsewhere ; and , finally , just what the possible causes may be ? hereditary , traumatic , infectious , economic , nutritional , or others .  | Muscular Dystrophy Muscular dystrophy , another crippling disease , this time of the neuromuscular system , takes its toll of thousands of Americans every year . At least 50 per cent of the victims are children between three and thirteen . Of these , few will reach their teens and all will die before maturity . Muscular dystrophy is not contagious and it does not kill its victims . They usually die of other diseases , primarily those of the respiratory tract . Weakness of the chest muscles makes coughing and bringing up mucous impossible , and the MD victims may die of suffocation in such attacks . A typical case is that of sturdy , red-cheeked Jimmy who won first prize in a " healthy baby " contest . His father , a professional boxer , displayed with pride his child 's well-developed muscles , which gave promise of a future athletic career . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports . At play , he could not keep up with the other boys . A playful push would send him sprawling on the ground , and he had more and more difficulty in rising . He developed a swayback and a peculiar side-to-side gait . " Jimmy 's at the awkward age , " his mother apologized . " He 'll get over it . " But Jimmy never outgrew his clumsiness . Instead , his muscles grew weaker . When he climbed stairs , he dragged his feet and pulled on the railings with both hands . At seven , and in a wheel chair , this promising youngster was a victim of progressive muscular dystrophy . Jimmy died before his tenth birthday . The childhood form of the disease , such as Jimmy had , is by far the most common type . It affects three times as many boys as girls , and is hereditary in one-third of all cases . As many as six children in one family have been stricken without warning . The second form , which starts in adolescence , progresses more slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This type also is hereditary , but males and females are equally affected . The third form , which commences in early adulthood , affects the facial muscles , shoulders , and upper arms . Although seriously handicapped in his muscles , the adult MD patient may live to a relatively advanced age and still be able to walk . Here again the cause of this tragic ailment is unknown . Scientists believe that it is due to faulty nutrition of the muscles , an improper functioning of the body 's intricate chemical processes which causes the muscles to degenerate until they are useless . But MD research has been sketchy at best , and for many years the disease has been described briefly in medical textbooks as invariably fatal , with cause and treatment unknown .  | Research and Rehabilitation in Muscular Dystrophy A few years ago , six mothers of doomed children met in New York to start a formal fight against muscular dystrophy . Through their efforts , the Muscular Dystrophy Association of America , Inc. , was founded and funds were raised to support a few modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereditary aspects of the disease through Mormon family records , conducted by the University of Utah scientists at Salt Lake , to more basic research in problems of muscle tension and contraction , headed by Dr. Albert Szent-Gyorgyi , Nobel Prize winner , at the Institute for Muscle Research , Woods Hole , Massachusetts . One of the most indefatigable MD researchers is Dr. Ade T. Milhorat of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center , who for twenty years has been making a personal study of the disease . Dr. Milhorat is convinced that the cause of MD lies in the failure of the human body to make proper use of Vitamin E ( alpha-tocopherol ) found in wheat germ , alfalfa , and lettuce . Confirming the work of other scientists , Dr. Milhorat can produce MD in laboratory animals by feeding them a Vitamin E deficiency diet ; he can restore the animals to health by giving them Vitamin E. But unfortunately , Vitamin E therapy does not help muscular dystrophy in human beings . Actually , it has been found that MD victims have plenty of Vitamin E in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the people so afflicted seemed to lack the ability to convert the Vitamin E into one of its quinone or hydroquinone products , which may be the form of Vitamin E necessary for normal metabolic activity of the muscles . In his small experimental clinic at New York Hospital , Dr. Milhorat and his assistants are probing the slight changes in the Vitamin E molecule which may give the vitamin the biologic activity which the main substance seems to lack in MD sufferers . For instance , alphatocopherol hydroquinone , which can cure MD in animals , seems to have a favorable effect on some of the chemical abnormalities of human sufferers . Research now in progress suggests that this compound may have similar effects on the clinical symptoms of the human disease . But as yet there is no proof . Dr. Milhorat 's conclusions are confirmed by those of another prominent scientist , Dr. Roger J. Williams , director of the Biochemical Institute at the University of Texas , who classes muscular dystrophy as one of the " inborn errors of metabolism . " In other tests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for various diseases . Fat people show definite changes from lean ; alcoholics differ from non-alcoholics ; mental-hospital patients from the mentally sound . Preliminary studies in Dr. Williams ' department , now  | being extended , show that muscular dystrophy patients have urinary excretion patterns distinctly different from those not affected . The substances have not yet been identified chemically , but as Dr. Williams points out , " this type of study should make it possible to determine what particular details of metabolism are genetically at fault in muscular dystrophy cases , and this in turn may well lead to the discovery of methods of treatment . " At the University of California School of Medicine , Dr. R. J. Ray Van Meter , clinical neurologist , has been working on another kind of treatment for muscular dystrophy ? a combination of amino acids and selected vitamins . In a small group of patients , treated over periods from two months to a year , there was improvement of various degrees in every patient , including a return of strength and a sense of wellbeing . Dr. Van Meter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a disease that has previously resisted treatment , his new therapy can not be considered a cure . If it holds up in further studies , in all probability the patients will have to take the replacement nutrients for the rest of their lives , just as diabetics take insulin . Dr. Van Meter bases his treatment on the theory that one or two failures in body metabolism may be the cause of MD . First , there might be a failure of the digestive system to split protein foods , such as meat , into amino acids . Proteins are made of a combination of some twenty-two amino acids . When proteins are taken into the body , the digestive system normally breaks them down into the amino acids of which they are composed . When these amino acids become available , they can be recombined , by the aid of the enzyme systems , into new body-building proteins such as muscle tissues . Obviously , if the digestive system fails to make the amino acids available , the body can not make the protein tissues it needs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems responsible for combining the amino acids into proteins ? in this case , into muscle tissue . Enzymes are chemicals which provide the energy for a large part of the body 's chemical reactions . Vitamins are intimately involved in enzyme reactions . So Dr. Van Meter uses a replacement formula based on these theories . The formula contains the twenty-two amino acids and what he considers essential vitamins ? riboflavin , calcium pantothenate , niacianamide , A , D , C , B-1 , B-6 , iron peptonate , and tribasic calcium phosphate . There are no scarce , expensive drugs in this formula ; the amino acids are prepared by the digestion of proteins by enzymes from hog pancreas glands , the usual commercial methods of preparing amino acids ; and the vitamins are made in quantity by all drug houses . A big job of research lies ahead for Dr. Van Meter . Biochemical studies must be made to determine what changes the treatment pro-  | duces in body chemistry to account for the improvement of the MD patients , and , also , what factors or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good effects noted ? return of strength , increase in size of the atrophied ( wasted ) muscles , restoring of normal respiratory action , and relief of depression . One six-year-old boy , unable to walk or pick up objects from the floor or do anything needing muscular action properly since he was three , is now running and skating after two months ' treatment under Dr. Van Meter . A woman of thirty-two , who had had the disease since the age of twelve , had such weak facial muscles that her eyes could not be closed ; her mouth was a typical straight line . She coughed badly ; could not raise her arms to arrange her hair ; was unable to rise from a chair . She considered herself a complete invalid . After one year of treatment there was a complete restoration of the facial muscles , and the chronic cough had disappeared . She could raise her arms with good strength , she performed her household duties , laundry , ironing , and cooking for a family of four . At the clinic , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of MD , it is best to keep the patient as active as possible and to encourage hint to live a life as close to normal as he can . Massage delays the development of contractures . So does exercise . Prolonged bedrest and sitting in a distorted position in a wheel chair hasten the course of muscular weakness and sometimes cause atrophy and contracture of the arms and legs . So the rehabilitation experts get the MD patients out of bed and wheel chairs , exercise them just short of fatigue , put them through special motions to prevent or decrease deformity , and teach them how to use slings and self-help gadgets . Myasthenia Gravis Still another baffling disease of the nervous system is myasthenia gravis . Muscular weakness and overwhelming fatigue are the outstanding symptoms . At first , the muscles of the neck , throat , lips , tongue , face , and eyes are affected . Later , those of the trunk , arms , and legs become involved . The onset of the disease is gradual . The patient complains of double vision , difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always worse in the evening . Some cases end fatally in a short time as a result of choking , but in 80 per cent , the patients linger for a long time , with occasional remissions . Women often have myasthenia gravis remissions during pregnancy . The cause is unknown , but it is generally believed that there is a connection between myasthenia gravis and the endocrine glands , particularly the tiny thymus gland in the chest . It may occur at any age ; it has even been seen in babies a few hours old . Before forty , women are affected twice as often as men ; after forty , the reverse is true . Before 1935 , myasthenia gravis was almost always fatal . Since then ,  | with the help of a synthetic chemical , Neostigmine ( trade name , Prostigmin ) , most of the patients have shown improvement and many have been restored to health . The treatment consists of frequent closes of neostigmine , in severe cases as many as three or four times a day . Also , the drug is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has myasthenia gravis . If his muscular weakness , which makes him unable to hold his eyes open , to feed himself , or even to swallow , is due to myasthenia gravis , it will disappear completely within fifteen minutes after neostigmine is injected into his veins . The patient is then alert and the picture of health . To keep him going , he takes the drug by mouth , some patients taking as many as twenty pills a day . It is given with atropine to allay occasional unpleasant effects , such as abdominal pain . Other drugs that can be used alone , or combined with neostigmine , are potassium chloride , ephedrine sulfate , Guanadine , and glycine . But in the long run , neostigmine gives the best results . Surgery in which the enlarged thymus gland is removed also seems to help myasthenia gravis patients , but the operation has a high mortality rate . X-ray treatment of the thymus has brought improvement in some cases . Myasthenia gravis is believed by many medical authorities to be a deficiency disease , resulting from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts at the junction between nerves and muscles . Without this substance , nerve impulses fail , and the victim 's muscles refuse to obey his will . " It was like cutting off my movements from my mind , " one patient described his symptoms . " I felt that my muscles were perfectly strong , yet I could not make them obey my will ? just as in a nightmare one becomes rooted to the spot . " To encourage awareness of this strange disease , and to unearth all kinds of research data needed to control its ravages , the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation , Inc. , 480 Lexington Avenue , New York , has been established . Dr. Henry R. Viets of Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston , one of the pioneers in the treatment of this disease , is chairman of the advisory board . Dr. Viets , who opened the first myasthenia gravis clinic in this country in Boston in 1935 , said : " If we find something for myasthenia gravis , it may open the door to many other diseases . " Cerebral Palsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor centers of the brain . As a result , control of the muscles is impaired or lost . The disability may be severe or mild . Only one part of the body may be affected , or there may be marked lack of control over the  | arms , legs , and speech . Vision and hearing also may be affected . In some cases , intelligence is impaired . Cerebral palsy is also called " tittle 's Disease " for an English surgeon , William John Little , who in 1862 wrote a paper describing this condition . The grimacing , drooling child with the shambling gait , which Dr. Little described , gave the inaccurate impression that patients of this disease always have these symptoms , and that they are feeble-minded . This is not true . Impaired intelligence does not necessarily come with cerebral palsy . At least 75 per cent of the patients have IQ 's of 70 to 100 . Statistics show that there are seven cerebral-palsied children in every 100,000 of the general population . Of these , one dies before the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentally deficient and require custodial care . Of the remaining four , one may be so severely disabled as to be homebound . The last three may , with scientific skill and patience , be helped . Damage to their brains can not be helped , but in the words of I ) r . Winthrop M. Phelps , one of the country 's leading cerebral palsy experts , " it can be improved to the point , in some cases , where , unless careful examination were made , it would be impossible to differentiate the cerebral palsy child from the normal youngster . " Two types of cerebral palsy account for about 85 per cent of the afflicted . They are : ( 1 ) spasticity , in which the muscles are tense and contracted ; ( 2 ) athetosis , in which the muscle movements are involuntary and unorganized . The remaining 15 per cent of the cases are made up of three types : ( 1 ) ataxia , in which the child has bad balance and poor orientation , walks uncertainly , and has particular difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the arms and legs tremble regularly ; and ( 3 ) rigidity , in which the muscles are abnormally stiff and inflexible . Causes of Cerebral Palsy The first cause of cerebral palsy is faulty prenatal development of brain cells ; the second , brain injury during a difficult birth . In the more severe cases , symptoms are evident from birth . Vomiting , irritability , and difficulty in nursing may occur . The babies are highly susceptible to infection , and may die early in infancy . In milder cases , the first signs of motor difficulty may not happen until the child fails to make normal progress . For instance , he may not sit up at six months , or begin to talk and walk at one year . About 25 per cent of these children have convulsions . Involuntary movements of the legs and arms are common , but usually they do not appear until the second or third year . Cerebral palsy is not always the result of faulty brain development  | or a birth injury . Sometimes it happens long after birth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cerebral palsy follows . Common childhood infections , such as whooping cough , mumps , and measles , may , by very high temperature and direct infection , produce brain damage . Other causes are eclampsia ( convulsions ) and kidney disease in the mother , and severe jaundice in the newborn child . Recent research has shown that incompatibility of the Rh blood factor may be responsible for cerebral palsy . Nothing can be done to prevent palsy caused by congenital malformation . But premature births , difficult delivery , and convulsions can be cut down or eliminated , and asphyxiation can be anticipated and averted . Diseases of the mother can be reduced by better prenatal care , especially by prevention of infectious illness , and by proper diet . Dr. John K. Link , pediatrician of the Edward J. Meyer Memorial Hospital , Buffalo , New York , once made an important survey of cerebral palsy children . In a period of five years , Link examined 150 palsied children , together with their parents . The 150 CP 's had 352 normal brothers and sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one family . Dr. Link 's study showed that the first-born child was most likely to have cerebral palsy . The principal causes of brain injuries noted in these cases were congenital malformations , 19 per cent ; version and extraction delivery ( turning the baby and taking him feet first ) , 19 per cent ; premature birth , 15 per cent ; breech delivery , 12 per cent ; difficult forceps delivery , 12 per cent ; and asphyxia ( oxygen deficiency ) , 3 per cent . Infectious disease and head injuries in early life covered the remaining children . Special Needs of Cerebral Palsy Children The needs of the cerebral palsy child include all those of a normal youngster , plus additional training in learning how to supply his own particular needs . The problem has many sides ? medical , psychological , educational , and social . A mild case may live a fairly normal life . In the moderately affected child , muscle re-education , speech training and lessons in one of the special schools for cerebral palsy children may rehabilitate him to such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to work . Careful mental tests are advisable , since many children with cerebral palsy are much more intelligent than their appearance would suggest ; slowness is often due to their physical handicap . In recent years there has been a tremendous spurt of interest in the problems of the cerebral palsied . Most of this is due to the splendidly organized United Cerebral Palsy , as well as to the cerebral palsy division of the National Society for Crippled Children and Adults . Through the vigorous support of these movements , research in diag-  | nosis and treatment has demonstrated that something can be done for cerebral palsy . Other special groups have assisted in fund-raising and in educational and rehabilitation programs . Well-sponsored research projects include studies in the Rh factor , diagnosis and treatment , psychological testing , emotional problems , educational and vocational counseling for the people who are handicapped by this disease . Poliomyelitis Poliomyelitis , the most terrifying of all diseases of childhood , is an acute infection of the anterior part of the spinal cord . In a large number of the cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnoticed , or to be classed as a " cold " or " stomach upset . " There is a sudden attack of fever , headache , sore throat , and sometimes vomiting . But the physical examination and the spinal fluid check are negative , and there are no signs of trouble in the central nervous system . The symptoms disappear within twenty-four to seventy-two hours , and the patient apparently recovers . But in some cases there is a recurrence of fever in four to seven days , followed by signs of central nervous system involvement , stiff back , stiff neck , muscle spasms , loss of reflexes . In the non-paralytic cases ( about 50 per cent ) , the symptoms stop short of actual muscular weakness . In the other half , muscle weakness and paralysis may develop rapidly . The site of the paralysis depends on the location of the infection in the spinal cord or medulla oblongata . If the medulla is involved , the bulbar form of the disease develops and paralysis of the pharynx , larynx , and other muscles controlled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have difficulty in swallowing , and other severe symptoms . The death rate in bulbar polio usually is over 50 per cent . Poliomyelitis is caused by a virus so small ( one millionth of an inch in diameter ) that it can not be seen through a powerful electron microscope . Recently , the virus has been isolated and photographed for the first time by two groups of researchers , one at Parke , Davis &; Co. , Detroit , and the other at the University of California , headed by Dr. Wendell Stanley , famous virus researcher , and his associates , Drs . Howard L. Bachrach and Carleton E. Schwedt . The new photograph of the spherically shaped virus is expected to provide more definite facts about its chemical makeup . In this tiny polio virus , there are three strains of the disease , each strain independent in its action and each immune to one type of polio . Scientists call them the Lansing type , for a young man who died of polio in Lansing , Michigan ; the Leon type , for a Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type , for a chimpanzee used in polio experiments in Baltimore . The symptoms caused by the  | three strains are all the same , but infection by one strain will not protect a polio victim against the other two . How Polio Virus Enters the Human Body Twenty-five years ago , it was believed that the polio virus must enter the body through the nose and throat and from there travel straight to the spine and brain . Later , it was learned that the virus could enter the body , not only through the nose and throat , but also through the mouth , probably with food . For years , scientists everywhere worked on the same problem : how to find when and where the polio virus is transmitted to the body . What they wanted most to do was to spot the precise tissue outside the nervous system in which the polio virus multiplies and spreads before it starts its march toward the spine and brain , damages the nerve cells , and causes paralysis or death . In April , 1952 , two groups of scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made polio history . Dr. David Bodian of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Dr. Dorothy Horstmann of Yale University in their separate research studies , both backed by the March of Dimes of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis , had discovered simultaneously that the polio virus enters the digestive tract and that it remains in the blood for a few clays ( sometimes as long as a week ) before it attacks the spinal cord and brain . Then , for the first time , the polio fighters had proof that there was a time and a place to immunize a child against the disease before it enters the nervous system and causes paralysis . If a suitable chemical or a serum could be injected while the virus lingered in the blood , the crippling effect of paralytic polio could be avoided . Better still , if a vaccine could be given early enough to stimulate the production of antibodies in the blood , then the virus could be blocked from attacking the nervous system . Gamma Globulin In their laboratory tests , Drs . Bodian and Horstmann had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In four to six days , a high concentration of polio virus appeared in the animals ' blood streams , and yet they remained lively and well . While the virus stayed in the blood , the blood manufactured antibodies to fight the invaders . But sometimes the blood did not make enough of these antibodies to keep on fighting , and then the virus went to the brain and spine . To build up antibodies in the monkeys and chimps , the animals were given inoculations of very small weak doses of gamma globulin ( a blood fraction containing antibodies ) . When the gamma globulin  | shots were given , the animals did not develop paralysis . When the shots were not given , they became paralyzed within ten to fifteen days . On the basis of the animal tests at Yale and Johns Hopkins , gamma globulin might be used to give children short-time immunity against polio paralysis while the virus lingered in their blood . Already a small experiment to immunize children with gamma globulin had been tried out during a polio epidemic . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Dr. William McD . Hammon , epidemiologist of the University of Pittsburgh , headed an inoculation program for the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis . Some 12,500 Utah boys and girls were divided into three groups . One group of 6,000 received no injections , another of 3,000 received injections of a harmless gelatin substance that resembles gamma globulin , the third group of 3,500 got shots of gamma globulin . Statistically , the polio epidemic rate in a group of 12,500 children is set at one child in 1,000 . At Provo , among the 6,000 who received no shots , there were twelve cases of the disease . In the group of 3,000 who had the gelatin , there were six cases . In the 3,000 children who had the GG shots , there was no polio at all . While the Provo results were highly encouraging , the number of gamma globulin shots was too few to be used as scientific proof . So the Foundation set aside $1,500,000 to clinch the theory of gamma globulin immunization with larger and more significant tests in the summer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houston , Texas , where a severe polio epidemic broke out in June . Over 35,000 children lined up for shots to determine whether or not the gamma globulin would protect them against polio paralysis . In Texas , as in Utah , the program was headed by Dr. Hammon , assisted by a team of therapists , technicians , and doctors . Boys and girls from one to six ( the age in which 50 per cent of all polio cases occur ) , had their shots in eight different clinics . One half got GG , the other half the gelatin substance . All got lollypops to soothe the sting of the injections . Only the master statistician in charge of the trials knew which children got the GG shots and which the substitute . On each child 's record sheet , with his or her name , went the serial number of the bottle from which he was inoculated . If the GG worked as expected , and if the youngster got it before the polio virus entered his body and passed through the blood stream to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the ten-day test , a group of polio experts stayed on in Houston to check the inoculated boys and girls . Each case of polio in the area in the one to six age group was checked to see whether the sick child had had one of the GG shots . A week later , the second large-scale GG trial was set up at Sioux City , Iowa , under a foundation grant . By then , the obscure medical term " gamma globulin " had become as familiar as aspirin . Sioux City  | youngsters , 16,000 strong , between the ages of one and eleven ( the group in which three-fourths of the Iowa polio cases had occurred ) , lined up for shots . Which children got the GG and which got the gelatin was known only to the authorities who watched to see how many , if any , of the boys and girls who had the shots , escaped paralytic polio , compared to those who did not get them . By mid-October , Dr. Hammon had gathered preliminary figures on the results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in Utah , Texas , and Iowa had received gamma globulin . In the thirtyday follow-up of these children , it was learned that there had been twenty-six cases of paralytic polio in the groups receiving GG shots , and sixty-four cases of this form of the disease in the group that got the gelatin . This would indicate that the children who had GG shots were given immunity for a short period ? between four to six weeks . Final results of the first tests were so promising that the GG program was expanded in the polio season of 1953 ; 100,000 children received the shots at a cost of $1,000,000 . The year 1952 had been the worst in the history of polio ? some 55,000 men , women and children were struck . Early in the spring of 1953 it looked as though an even larger epidemic might be anticipated . Yet , possibly because of the widespread use of GG , the spread of the disease appeared to be controlled , the case rates reduced . In the end , there were fewer than 48,000 cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many areas for this substantial reduction . Anti-Polio Vaccine Yet polio researchers knew that gamma globulin could never be the final answer to polio control . Gamma globulin gives immediate but not permanent immunity against crippling polio . It is scarce . It takes fifteen cc 's of GG to protect one child against polio for three months , and two shots may be necessary for complete protection . And it takes about a pint of whole blood to make an average dose of gamma globulin . For permanent protection , scientists knew , a child must develop in his own blood enough of those mysterious agents called antibodies to fight the polio virus . And that meant a safe anti-polio vaccine . The final goal then was to find a vaccine , similar to that used against smallpox , yellow fever , and diphtheria , which would create long-lasting immunity against all three strains of the polio virus ? Lansing , Leon , and Brunhilde . Otherwise , polio might strike one person three times . Above all , the vaccine had to be safe . The polio researchers could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a polio epidemic in the early 1930 's which failed to protect the patients and was thought to have been responsible for the deaths of a dozen chil-  | dren . So the March of Dimes research was centered on two kinds of vaccine ? one made with live polio virus and the other of a virus killed , or inactivated , by the chemical formaldehyde , and so robbed of its power to cause any infection . Yet , when injected into the body , the killed virus helps it to manufacture antibodies in amounts large enough to protect against the disease . Of all the experimental anti-polio vaccines tested by the researchers , one made of the killed virus was the most promising . It was developed in the big laboratories at the University of Pittsburgh , by Dr. Jonas E. Salk , a dark , dynamic young bacteriologist . For many months , Dr. Salk had tested his vaccine on monkeys and chimpanzees , injecting it into the muscles of the animals with a mineral oil , a substance which seemed to stimulate the formation of antibodies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the animal were examined to determine the amount of antibodies that had been formed and how long they lasted . In every case , Dr. Salk 's animals continued to show solid immunity against polio . As soon as they received the vaccine shots , the monkeys and chimps built up a tremendous quantity of protective antibodies . Immunity to polio lasted for about six months ? the same time as whooping cough and diphtheria immunizations . Safe and Effective Immunization against Polio Dr. Salk 's vaccine is a polyvalent ? that is , it contains all three strains of the polio virus . And it is safe and effective . Polio in monkeys and chimps follows the human course of the disease so closely that the use of similar vaccine shots to prevent polio in children and adults looked brighter than ever before . The Salk vaccine was cheap and easy to make . That had not always been so . For many years , researchers could grow the virus only in the nerve cells of living monkeys , an expensive and time-consuming process . Such a virus could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the material taken from the infected nerve cells , when injected in human beings , could cause a violent reaction and even death . This problem was solved when Dr. John E. Enders , another famous bacteriologist of Harvard University , succeeded in growing the polio viruses in a test tube . This experiment , as one researcher put it , " marked the end of the monkey era in polio research . " Enders not only succeeded in growing the elusive virus in test tubes , he showed for the first time that the virus could be grown in tissue taken from any part of the human body . And he grew the virus with all three polio strains . This promised a cheap , fast method for supplying large amounts of polio virus . The vaccine used by Dr. Salk at Pittsburgh is  | made simply and inexpensively of virus grown in test tubes by the Enders technique . Mass Inoculation Polio Tests For many months , Dr. Salk tried out his vaccine on groups of children and adults , some 5,000 in all ? before he was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsored by the National Foundation , in which many thousands of children , in various sections of the United States , received anti-polio shots , began in March , 1954 , and extended through the summer , when the case rate for this disease rises . In each community , foundation officials were aided by public school systems , local medical societies , health officers and practicing pediatricians . The anti-polio shots were administered by local doctors . Each school child in the second and third grades received three shots ( one cc each ) two to three weeks apart , for permanent immunization against polio . The vaccine is safe " beyond all doubt , " Dr. Hart E. Van Riper , medical director of the Foundation , emphasized . Of the 5,000 children and adults vaccinated before the mass program began , there was not one " adverse reaction . " In fact , Dr. Salk thought so well of his anti-polio vaccine that he tested it on his three young children , his wife , and himself . The vaccine 's safety was further tested in a three-way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked by three independent groups : Dr. Salk 's own laboratory , Parke , Davis 8c Company at Detroit , and the Biological Standard Committee of the National Institute of Health , Washington , D.C. The vaccine program cost the National Foundation more than $7,500,000 . But to make sure of holding the line against this crippling disease , the foundation continued to buy gamma globulin , not as a preventive agent , but to help minimize the effects of the disease , temporarily at least . In 1954 they are spending $19,000,000 for gamma globulin to be administered to some 2,000,000 children . If all goes well , enough polio vaccine should be commercially available in 1955 to immunize all children . Defeat of Polio Is in Sight Today , even the most cautious polio authorities are confident that poliomyelitis has been controlled . It cost more than $18,000,000 in March of Dimes funds and fifteen years of undaunted research by hundreds of scientists to bring knowledge of polio to the point where a vaccine could be prepared . More millions must be spent ; more work must be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the March of Dimes  | funds ( about $140,000,000 ) of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis has been spent on polio patients ' medical care during illness and on expert rehabilitation therapy . More money will be needed for them and for future victims . But the dramatic research achievements of the last two years renew hope that soon every parent will be freed from the dread of polio . Until then , as every polio specialist emphasizes , good treatment given promptly will help thousands of polio victims to recover , with little or no after-effects . That is why every mother and father must heed the warning signs : sore throat , a head cold , nausea and vomiting , fever , diarrhea and sometimes constipation , loss of appetite , pain particularly in the arms and leg muscles , and stiffness of the neck or back . The latest research confirms the theory that the chance of polio is increased by the removal of tonsils and adenoids during the polio season . Also , some scientists believe that there is a link between the susceptibility to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whooping cough . Shots can be given and tonsils and adenoids removed during the times when there is little or no polio in the neighborhood . New Methods of Treatment for Rehabilitation of Polio Victims Infantile paralysis kills about 5 per cent of its victims . But new methods of treatment and faster and more accurate diagnosis are rapidly increasing the chance to live . Latest respirators and iron lungs are better than those models used ten years ago . The reliable , but awkward , tank respirator , has been replaced by a small , comfortable cylinder respirator , or even by a lightweight plastic chest respirator which gives the patient a wider range of movement . At the Harvard School of Public Health , where the iron lung was first developed , scientists have constructed the Electro-Phrenic Respirator . A hollow needle containing a copper wire is attached to the phrenic nerve in the side of the patient 's neck , which serves both the lungs and the diaphragm . When the current goes on , the nerve is stimulated and causes the diaphragm to contract and draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically , relaxing the diaphragm and forcing the air out . Also , at the Harvard School of Public Health , a sit-up respirator has been devised . Mechanically , it works like a conventional iron lung with a slowly pulsing partial vacuum sucking out the patient 's chest and thus pumping air into his lungs . But instead of being restricted to the uncomfortable lying-down position , the patient inside the new lung sits upright on a comfortable chair , and has a normal view of the world , rather than seeing life backwards in a mirror  | suspended above his face . The chair is adjustable to suit the patient 's height . Other devices to aid and comfort the polio convalescent are : an electric rocking bed which simulates natural motion ? tilting helps the patient breathe by pushing his abdominal organs against the lungs , then dropping them back ; a " coughing machine " developed by Dr. Alvin E. Barach of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons , which rids paralyzed patients of strangling phleghm by sudden compression of air on chest and diaphragm ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength electronically after a polio attack , so that rehabilitation can be planned . In some of the polio centers , patients are learning what they like to call " frog breathing " ? known by their doctors as glossopharyngeal ( throat-tongue ) breathing . The patients themselves evolved frog breathing . The trick is to use the back of the tongue as a pump , to gulp small mouthfuls of air , and to guide them down the windpipe instead of the esophagus . Some of the users have so perfected " frog breathing " that they can spend up to fourteen consecutive hours outside the mechanical respirators . Since the gasping and gulping is by no means involuntary , like normal breathing , they must retreat to their mechanical lungs when they want to sleep . Doctors have examined frog breathers with fluoroscopes and X-rays in order to learn every detail of this technique , so as to teach it to new patients . They have also made a motion picture , illustrating its intricacies , to be used as a training film at other respiratory centers . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct this disability ( see Chapter X ) . Strong muscles can be transplanted to take over the job of weakened ones unable to carry on their work . Weak joints can be treated so that useless legs can again bear weight . When necessary , legs can be slowed down in their growth or shortened by surgery to match the polio-shortened limbs . When paralysis is present , polio specialists depend on physical therapy , heat , water , massage , and electricity to keep the muscles healthy while waiting for injured nerves to recover . So far there is no drug , chemical , or antibiotic that will cure polio . The men whose job it is to search for the ideal drug have some hopeful leads . But they still say : " Not yet . " Blindness For the 308,000 blind men , women , and children ( 20-200 vision or less ) in the United States , there is more extensive , well-organized care than for people with any other chronic disability . Long before the development of rehabilitation programs in this country , state and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | problems of the blind . Outstanding among the private agencies in this field is the American Foundation for the Blind , a national agency founded in 1921 to coordinate scattered programs and to conduct research to solve some of the many difficulties of sightless people . Other vigorously active organizations are the National Society for the Prevention of Blindness in New York , and the New York Association for the Blind , the famous " Lighthouse " dedicated to illuminating the lives of blind people , with programs starting with nursery school and continuing through classes for the elderly . Since 1945 , the Army , Navy , and Veterans Administration have cooperated in developing programs for the welfare of the war-blinded . More recently , the National Institute for Neurological Diseases and Blindness , part of the United States Public Health Service , Bethesda , Maryland , has set up an elaborate research project , part of which is concentrated on new methods for preventing blindness and for treating those who are already sightless . About 50 per cent of the cases of blindness are caused by disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevention and research , in most cases , is concentrated on these two fields . Trachoma Trachoma causes more blindness in the world than any other single infection . But the trachoma virus has been conquered , at least in the United States , by the sulfa drugs . Smallpox , once an important cause of blindness , now results in little loss of sight in countries where vaccination is compulsory . Of every ten children entering schools for the blind in the United States during the early years of the century , three were sightless because of " babies ' sore eyes , " known to doctors as ophthalmia neonatorum , a disease caused by an infectious organism in the birth canal of the mother . The use of silver nitrate drops in the eyes of infants immediately after birth , a compulsory practice in many North and South American countries , has drastically cut blindness resulting from this disease . In the United States blindness from prenatal syphilis among children has also been reduced , both by examination of expectant mothers and by treatment with antibiotics . Other infectious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarlet fever , typhoid fever , and tuberculosis may cause blindness , but with better prevention and care , these cases , too , are dropping . Diabetes ; nephritis , or Bright 's Disease ; anemia , nutritional deficiencies , and high blood pressure are other conditions which can affect the eyes , causing blindness . But with the knowledge specialists now have , some of the cases of blindness from these diseases can be prevented . In spite of this optimistic outlook , infant blindness is increasing  | because of a condition known as retrolental fibroplasia , seen chiefly among premature babies with low birth weights . Since more and more premature infants are being kept alive each year , an increasing number of these children develop this condition and lose their sight . At birth , the structure of the baby 's eyes may appear to be normal . But when he is about four weeks old , blood vessels in the arteries stretch , the retina swells , and the globe of the eye clouds up . This is caused by an abnormal growth of tissue in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually this tissue growth behind the lens of the eye has shut off all sight . The cause of this condition is not known . Some scientists suspect that the elaborate care given the premature infant ? high protein diet , large amounts of vitamins , repeated transfusions of blood and plasma , oxygen , amino acids , and even hormone therapy ? may upset the child 's delicate body balance and lead to blindness . Researchers are investigating this and other possibilities . So far , a high concentration of oxygen in the child 's incubator seems to point to the cause of this eye condition . While doctors are cutting the mortality rate of premature infants , they are also stretching the life span of adults ; so again more blindness results , in this case because of middle- and old-age diseases , such as cataracts ( 24 per cent of adult loss of sight ) and glaucoma ( 12 per cent ) . But with prompt diagnosis and treatment , medical science can save the sight of 50 per cent of the people suffering from these two diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cataract . About 49,000 Americans are sightless for this reason , but many of them could see again with the help of surgery . A cataract is an opacity of the crystalline lens behind the pupil , the part of the eye that focuses rays of light on the retina . When the cataract is fully developed , light will not pass through the lens , but is reflected back . Treatment is surgery , removal of the crystalline lens . If the eye is otherwise healthy , the operation , under modern methods , is successful in the vast majority of the cases and the patient makes up for the loss of the lens by wearing special glasses . Glaucoma Glaucoma is a serious disease of the eyes which will cause total blindness if not diagnosed and treated early . In its acute form , the eyeball hardens rapidly , there is intense pain , and sight goes quickly . If the patient consults an experienced eye man , he will detect the disease quickly and clear up the condition by surgery . If delayed too long , surgery will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in  | the United States are suffering from glaucoma and yet are totally unaware that they are slowly going blind . The chronic form of glaucoma , in which there are periods of blurring , but little pain at first , can , in some cases , be treated medically by pilocarpine , Floropryl , or neostigmine . When the tension can not be controlled , or the eyes show increasing defects , surgery becomes imperative . Accidents as Cause of Blindness Industrial accidents alone are responsible for thousands of cases of blindness in adults in the United States . Besides these , there are eye accidents in homes , on streets , and in offices . But 90 per cent of the cases of blindness from industrial accidents could be prevented if proper safety measures were set up . Certain occupations are particularly hazardous to the eyes . Corrosive solutions may be splashed or dangerously abrasive particles may be thrown into the eyes by grinding or chipping tools . Goggles of an approved pattern should be worn by workmen who weld metals , use high-speed grinding tools or mechanical chipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and about 1,000 of these accidents cause a child to lose the sight of one or both eyes . Of the young children , seven per cent of these injuries are caused by balls , stones , sticks , scissors , knives , peashooters , firecrackers , or BB guns . Boys injure their eyes about three times as often as girls , and children in the grades from seven through nine run up the highest eye-accident toll . Mishaps occur most frequently during sports or play , particularly when the play is unsupervised . Early Prevention of Blindness In a large majority of cases , blindness can be prevented by regular eye examination of school children . One out of every four youngsters in the United States needs eye care , but rarely will he complain , since he does not know just how well he is expected to see . So it is up to the parents and teachers to know these symptoms of eye trouble in a child : 1 . He rubs his eyes frequently , frowns , tries to brush away a blur . 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head forward when looking at near or distant objects . 3 . He has trouble in reading or in other work requiring close use of his eyes . 4 . He blinks more than is usual , cries often , is irritable when doing close work . 5 . He stumbles or trips over small objects . 6 . He ca n't play games requiring distance vision . 7 . He holds books or small objects close to his eyes . 8 . He is  | very sensitive to light . 9 . He has red-rimmed or swollen eyelids , recurring sties , or inflamed or watery eyes . These symptoms may be caused by eye trouble , or by a general disease ; the child may need glasses or a change of glasses . A competent eye examination will find the answer . In cross eyes , only a few cases may be corrected by glasses . More often , orthopedic training , special exercises of the eye muscles or surgery , or a combination of both , may be necessary . The earlier a cross-eyed child is treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Every child should have periodic eye examinations before going to school , at intervals during school life , and more frequently as he grows older . Prompt treatment by qualified specialists in defects and diseases of the eyes and cultivation of good eye habits ? proper reading posture , occasional periods of rest during prolonged reading , adequate light and avoiding glare , and avoidance of reading very fine print on poor paper ? will insure good vision . For comfortable reading , print should be held below the level of the eyes and from sixteen to eighteen inches away from the eyes . A few years ago , the National Society for the Prevention of Blindness began a countrywide test of the . eyesight of American school children . When the eyes were tested and medically examined , onefifth ( more than 4,500,000 ) had some form of defective vision . State education commissioners and county and city school superintendents sent statistics to the society . Other investigators noted shocking lack of proper facilities for medical attention and bad conditions in many classrooms that caused eye fatigue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of classrooms , nonglare surroundings , coloring of walls and floors to meet illumination standards , lightadjustable desks , and more legible maps , books , and other reading matter . The society also urged vision tests on entering school as well as periodic tests at regular intervals ; some form of medical care and public health nursing so that serious eye defects could be promptly diagnosed and the establishment of sight-saving classes with extra-large textbooks and typewriter-type for children with subnormal vision . Living with Blindness For the sightless child , the range of opportunities is growing ? just as it grows for all ages . For those who can not read written or printed words , there is a wealth of knowledge in store for them in Braille books . They can study , can go to college if they have the aptitude , and can prepare for various professions where lack of sight is not too serious a handicap . Today there are successful blind lawyers , teachers , social workers , musicians , ministers , and insurance brokers .  | Hundreds of special devices to aid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American Foundation for the Blind . These aids cover everything from the popular Talking Books library ( approximately 2,500 recorded titles , distributed free to blind borrowers by the Library of Congress regional libraries ) to small gadgets to help blind homemakers , craftsmen , and technicians . A sightless housewife runs her fingers along the grooved edge of her pressure cooker and sets the utensil for the desired pressure weight . With an interval timer marked in Braille , she cooks her eggs to the proper minute . In her kitchen , she can depend on Brailled scales and can markers , adjustable slicers , graters , coffee dispensers , and therrnometers for liquids and for roasts . Since only about 20 per cent of the nation 's blind can read Braille , many of the Foundation 's gadgets depend chiefly on simpler tactile treatments such as special lines , grooves , and raised surfaces . Some of these have been revised exclusively for the blind . Some , like the standard General Electric household timer , have been modified slightly ( the glass is removed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours ) . The most popular items sold are light , collapsible canes , pocket watches and private-ear pocket radios which weigh less than a pound . For sightless technicians , there is an auditory circuit analyzer prepared for tactile readings of resistances , voltages , and currents . Also , there is a cloth tape measure stapled for inches and feet , a Braille cast-aluminum ruler , a carpenter 's level with a free-rolling chromesteel ball , and a Miterite saw guide adapted for cross cutting and ripping . Games are popular with the blind . The Foundation 's catalogue includes cleverly indented and marked Chinese checkers , English chess sets , and parcheesi sets . For the blind diabetic there is a special syringe for self-injections with a stop set by a doctor or nurse for the desired dosage . There is also a clinical thermometer with an open gauge which the blind person can " read . " Whenever a sightless man or woman turns up with a problem , the Foundation tries to solve it , usually by adding one more aid to the growing list . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . He wanted a baby carriage that a blind man could pull , not push . The foundation experts set to work on the idea . The blind person 's most severe handicap is lack of mobility ? the power to move from place to place with ease and safety , to recognize surroundings , and to orient himself to his physical environment . To a great degree , the sightless person must depend on his sharpened senses of hearing and touch , on a guide dog ( The Seeing Eye , Inc. , Morristown , New Jersey , has trained 2,857 animals , average life span ten years , to guide the blind ) , and the familiar tapping cane , now  | brought up to date by the Hoover Cane technique , developed by Dr. Richard E. Hoover , ophthalmologist of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , in which a chest-high cane is used as a " bumper " for protection and as an antenna to detect objects when swung from side to side at different levels and in rhythm with the user 's steps . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past no coordinated plan for scientific teaching of mobility restoration , outside of the Armed Forces and the Veterans Administration , had been attempted and there were only forty full-time mobility restoration experts in the country . One of the workers in the field of the blind most concerned over this lack is Father Thomas J. Carroll , director of the Archdiocese of Boston 's Catholic Guild for the Blind . This priest , who has devoted much of his life to rehabilitation of the blind , has set up a committee to restore a high degree of independence in the sightless . Under the auspices of the Catholic Guild and with the supporting interests of the Veterans Administration and the American Foundation for the Blind , a conference was held in which thirty experts on various fields of blind activities , including five blind men with rehabilitation jobs , met to evaluate present mobility restoration methods and to form a committee in which standards for accredited teaching will be set .

Knudson , director of the Veterans Administration 's physical medicine and rehabilitation service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national program , patterned after the Army 's plan for rehabilitation of the blind , in which civilians will have the benefit of the Army 's concentrated work on the mobility problem . Deafness The term deafness applies to any impairment of the hearing . It varies in severity and may be temporary , as in little Bill 's experiment in " putting beans in his ears , " or chronic , as in his grandfather 's otosclerosis , a degenerative disease of the inner ear . About 15,000,000 people in the United States are " hard of hearing " to some extent in one or both ears . About 4,000,000 are seriously handicapped . About 1,000,000 are totally deaf , and 20,000 deaf children have been educated in public and private schools for the deaf . Besides that , there are some 3,000,000 hard-of-hearing children in public schools , who can not keep pace with their fellow pupils because of this handicap . Children with hearing troubles repeat their grades four times as often as children with normal hearing . The annual national expense of grade repetitions for hard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities and only twenty-one states require periodic  | hearing tests in public schools . In some of the twenty-one states , compulsory hearing conservation laws are not being enforced . Total or partial impairment of the hearing may be caused by a wide variety of causes , ranging from neglect of treatment of upper respiratory infections , resulting in chronic middle ear disease , to disorders of the eighth ( auditory ) cranial nerve by infectious diseases such as meningitis , typhoid , mumps , measles , streptococcus infections , and brain tumors , and by toxic substances such as quinine , arsenic , alcohol , and salicylates . Other origins of impaired hearing are head blows which cause skull fractures and concussions , damage to the ears from blasts , explosions , and the effect of working in an extremely noisy environment for long periods of time . Penicillin and the other antibiotics which combat bacterial infections have had a dramatic effect on the control of ear infections and the prevention of serious damage to the hearing . When these drugs are used promptly , a mastoid operation seldom becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible to cure a much higher percentage of meningitis cases than in the pre-penicillin days . Normal Hearing Only a specialist can determine the type and amount of hearing loss , but answers to these questions , prepared by medical authorities of the American Hearing Aid Association , New York , may give a clue to whether or not hearing is normal : 1 . Do you find that people seem to be mumbling or slurring their words when they talk to you ? 2 . Do you hear better in noisy places than in quieter ones ? 3 . Are you bothered by head noises or " ringing " in the ears ? 4 . Do harsh loud noises seem actually painful to you ? 5 . Do you find that at one moment you can not hear someone speaking to you , and at the next , they seem to be shouting ? 6 . Can you hear the sound of a voice but find it difficult or impossible to understand what is being said ? 7 . Do you seem to hear better with one ear than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow and scowl ? perhaps without realizing it ? while straining to hear what people are saying ? 9 . Do you have trouble hearing when attending church , listening to the radio , watching television or seeing a motion picture ? If your answer to any one of these questions is " yes , " you may have a hearing loss . If your answer is " yes " to more than one question , your hearing is probably impaired . In either case , you should consult a doctor .  | The Human Ear ? How It Works The human ear , one of the most amazing organs of the body , enables you to distinguish a third of a million pure tones . First , sound waves enter the ear and strike the eardrum deep within the outer ear , setting in motion the three smallest bones in the body . Located in the middle ear , they are the ossicles ? better known as the hammer , anvil and stirrup . The stirrup ? which receives the sound from the hammer and anvil ? then vibrates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the inner ear . Movements of the oval window are carried by the fluid in the inner ear to the cochlea , an intricate mechanism that " feels " the movements of the fluid . In some mysterious manner , the cochlea 's vibrating membrane ? containing some 25,000 tiny , hairlike cells ? receives and analyzes sound vibrations and telegraphs the results to the brain . Then you experience the sensation of sound . All this action takes places in an area only one and one-quarter inches long . The Best Hearing Time The ears function differently at different times of the day . Recently a group of students at the University of Wisconsin were given hearing tests every hour during a twenty-four period . They showed the keenest hearing at seven A.M. ? the dullest at one P.M. The experiment showed a definite falling off of hearing ability immediately after meals . Hearing was better on days when the students ate light meals than when they ate heavier ones . Light exercise heightened hearing ability , while strenuous exercise lowered it . Many hard-of-hearing persons believe their hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or upset . They may be right . For emotional turmoil does influence hearing . Grief or fright sometimes cause hearing disturbances in people with ear defects , and in the hard of hearing , emotional shock may show itself in one of the weaker parts of the body ? the ears . Hearing Aids Loss of vision excites instant pity , but loss of hearing more often provokes ridicule . People with even mildly impaired vision do not hesitate to wear glasses . But it is not so with deafness . There is marked resistance to wearing hearing aids , even when the deafness has reached an advanced degree . Most deaf people are hypersensitive to the reactions of their companions ; they feel that the use of an aid carries with it a stigma of social and business handicap . Yet the use of the  | hearing aid can bring remarkable changes ? both psychological and vocational ? in the user 's life . Despite considerable initial resistance , the habit of wearing the device is being overcome gradually , and some 5,000,000 people now are using them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , modifies , and " tailors " the sounds and transmits them , greatly intensified , to the ear . It differs from the old-fashioned ear trumpet in that batteries , and not the human voice , supply the energy of the sound that the listener finally hears . The voice of the speaker merely serves to control the flow of electric current in the wires to the earpiece and gives it the pattern of the voice sounds . The receiver in the listener 's ear , like the telephone receiver at the end of the line , converts the electric current back into sound . The sound generated in the earpiece , like the sound from a public address system , may be made much louder than the sound that falls upon the microphone ( transmitter ) because its energy comes from the battery . A telephone is designed to produce at a distance a sound nearly as loud as the original voice . The energy from the battery of a telephone is required to drive the current through the long wires . A hearing aid is designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of a very short cord . Thus , the energy of the battery serves to overcome the hearing loss of the listener . Modern electric hearing aids contain either miniature vacuum-tube amplifiers or germanium , the rare metal transistors , both of which " step up " the weak electric current from the microphone to the much stronger current delivered to the receiver . They are the " heart " of hearing aids and can increase the intensity of sound millions of times . These devices can not do the impossible , of course . When hearing loss is 80 per cent or more , they do not help very much . If the auditory nerve has been severely damaged or destroyed , the hearing aid is useless . Furthermore , not all people can be trained to use them successfully . In some cases , the aids have to be supplemented by hearing re-education such as lip reading and sound interpretation . There are resources in almost every community where lip reading is taught and where books are available through services and libraries . Many excellent hearing devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the pocketbook of the vast majority of the deaf people in the United States . The ear specialist can do a great deal to rehabilitate the hard-of-hearing person by prescribing the device best suited to his condition and teaching him how to use it . The American Hearing Society of Washington , D.C. , the American Hearing Aid Association in New York , and other similar organizations have examined many kinds of apparatus and have lists of hearing aids that  | have been tested and found technically adequate , as well as information on how to use them . Deaf ? or Hard of Hearing ? A person is " deaf " if his sense of hearing is non-functional for the ordinary purposes of life . This group is made up of two distinct classes , both based on the time of the loss of hearing : ( 1 ) the congenitally deaf ? those who were born deaf ; and ( 2 ) the adventitiously deaf ? those who were born with normal hearing but in whom the sense of hearing is damaged or lost later through illness or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if his sense of hearing , although defective , functions with or without a hearing aid . Otosclerosis The most frequent cause of serious hearing impairment in the adult is otosclerosis , the formation of spongy bone in the capsule of the labyrinth of the middle ear . Up to now , there is no medical treatment for this disease . In some cases , the fenestration operation ? surgery on the ear mechanism which provides a new " window " connecting the middle and inner ear ? has prevented total deafness . " Fenestration " consists of drilling a microscopic hole , within the middle ear , through the natural hearing " window " to the inner ear . It is a delicate and arduous operation , performed under magnification because membranes in the ear are so delicate that the slightest touch with an instrument could cause them to break . The hole that is made in the bone-in-the-window , deep within the ear , allows sound to pass through into the cochlea , or microphone , and on to the brain , or loudspeaker . But the fenestration operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient with otosclerosis must depend on a hearing device or lip reading . Rehabilitation of the Deaf Rehabilitation of the deafened person must start with prevention ? and that is the examination of school children , with prompt medical care when trouble turns up . Progressive deafness can be cured or permanently arrested in about 75 per cent of all cases when it is found and properly treated early in childhood . In many communities , each school child is tested with an audiometer , or a similar device which will show the degree of his hearing impairment . If he has a hearing loss of 9 per cent or more , the child is tested by a more individual machine which will accurately indicate the type of deafness , and , to some extent , the kind of treatment to be followed .  | Even before school age , parents should watch for the important symptoms that indicate deafness . They are : ( 1 ) failure to notice moderately loud speech and other sounds ; ( 2 ) delayed speech ; ( 3 ) failure to hum a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to moderately loud music on the radio or phonograph ; ( 4 ) a lack of muscular jumping and no winking of the eyes when there are loud noises such as shouting , church bells , automobile backfiring , fire engine and police sirens . Parents should not delay medical care for earaches , runny noses , or recurrent colds . A severe ear infection from these causes may deprive the child of one of his most valued senses . For the doubly handicapped ? the deaf-blind ? there are rehabilitation programs , including Braille reading , lip reading , and psychological orientation . Cooperation between the blind counselor and the hearing specialist is necessary to help these difficult cases . The American Foundation for the Blind has a special department for services to the deaf-blind . Footnote New York , N. Y.  | Footnote
