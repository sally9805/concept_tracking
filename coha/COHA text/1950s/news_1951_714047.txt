txt Special CO THE NEW YORK TIMES , WASHINGTON , Aug. 2 ? Mrs. Hede Massing , confessed former Communist spy , told a Senate group this morning that she had recruited two State Department officials as spies and then had haggled with Alger Hiss over who should control one of them . Mrs. Massing , former wife of the Communist bail - jumper , Gerhart Eisler , told the Senate Internal Security subcommittee that her first " prize " accomplishments as an espionage agent in Washington in the early Nineteen Thirties had been enlisting Noel H. Field and Laurence Duggan into her spy apparatus . She said she believed Mr. Field was then in the Western European Division of the department and that Mr. Duggan was the department 's Latin American expert . Mr. Field , with his wife , his brother , Herman , and his daughter , Erika , disappeared , presumably behind the Iron Curtain , in 1949 . Leaped to Death Here Mr. Duggan jumped to his death from his sixteenth-floor office at 2 West Forty-fifth Street Dec. 21 , 1948 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Bureau of Investigation had shown him to be a " loyal employe . " Mrs. Massing 's husband , Eisler , fled the country in 1949 while facing charges . of passport fraud and contempt of Congress . He has turned up since as propaganda chief for the Soviet Government of East Germany . She testified today that it had taken her about a year and a half to persuade Mr. Field to turn over State Department material to the Soviet espionage chiefs , but that Mr. Duggan had consented after she had talked to him " two or three times . " He had insisted , however , she said , that it be done orally and that the person assigned to deal with him be able to speak English perfectly and know shorthand . The witness then repeated testi // mqny she had given at the second Alger Hiss trial , at , which the for- , mer State Department official was convicted on perjury charges . She said that at a cocktail party in the Field home Hiss had accused her of trying to take Mr. Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , they had agreed " it was all the same anyway because we were both working for the same boss . " Investigating Asia Policy The subcommittee is investigating subversive influences on United States foreign policies , especially as they apply to the Far Last . A large part of this morning 's testimony revolved around persons whom Mrs. Massing had known and whose names at one time or another had been used in connection with the Institute of Pacific Relations , an organization its members say was founded to study Far Eastern problems objectively . The names of Prof. Owen Lattimore and Joseph F. Barnes , which had figured in previous testimany , came up again at this morning 's session . Professor Lattimore , an institute official and one-time editor of its magazine , Pacific Affairs , was brought into the testimony when Robert Morris , subcommittee counsel , introduced two letters identified as having come from the institute 's files . One letter dated Feb. 27 , 1939 , was addressed to James S. Allen , 508 West 139th Street , New York , and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 168 West Twentythird Street , New York . Mrs. Massing said she had known Mr. Allen under his real name , Sol Auerbach and that he had been an " open member " of the Communist party . She said she had known Mr. Granich's- wife as a member of the Communist party , but she " did not know " about Mr. Granich hlinself . Saw Barnes in Moscow The witness said she had seen Mr. Barnes in Moscow in 1937 . She said she and her husband had been brought to Moscow " under surveillance " and while there had been escorted constantly by a Peter Zubelin , a member of the NKVD secret police . Members of this organization , she said , were isolated to such an extent that they even had their own special tennis courts to which admittance was gained only by identification . One day , she said , she accompanied Zubelin and her husband to the tennis courts and there she saw Mr. Barnes playing . She said she knew him to be an American newspaper man and she complained to Zubelin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen there by an American . The Soviet officer replied , she testified , " Oh , Barnes ! Do n't worry about him . " Mr. Barnes , former foreign editor of The New York Herald Tribune , is now an editor for Simon and Schuster , publishers . Both ' Mr. Lattimore , a professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , and Mr. Barnes have emphatically denied having been Communists or having had connections with any Soviet organizations . Mrs. Massing said she had seen Mr. Barnes only that one time in Moscow and that she had met Mr. Lattimore only once , at a social affair in Washington . Many Letters Introduced RIVALRY WITH HISS OVER SPY RELATED Mrs. Ede Massing , the former Mrs. Gerhart Eisler , testifying before the Senate Internal Security subcommittee . The New York Times RED INQUIRY WITNESS Letter after letter was introduced by Mr. Morris into the record , with the explanation that he was relating one or another person to the activities of the Institute of Pacific Relations . One of the names brought up today was that of Frederick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is serving a six-month jail sentence for contempt of court . He was found guilty in New York Federal Court of contempt in refusing to name contributors to a bail fund for Communist leaders , convicted of conspiring to teach and advocate violent overthrow of the Government . Mrs. Massing testified , and the committee secretary agreed , that there was no family relationship between Noel H. and Frederick Vanderbilt Field . One exchange of letters was allegedly between Frederick Vanderbilt Field and Mr. Duggan . Reproductions of all letters introduced were passed around to newspaper men . They all bore only typewritten signatures . The first of the alleged DugganField letters was on a Department of State letterhead dated Nov. 7 , 1935 . This letter was addressed to Mr. Field at the Institute of Pacific Relations , 129 East Fiftysecond Street . Bearing the salutation " Dear Fred " and signed " Larry " the letter invited Mr. Field to come to Washington to address a group on " international matters of interest . " The letter noted that " some time we would like to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far East as the result of Europe 's preoccupations . " In subsequent notes the engagement was confirmed . One of these , purportedly from Mr. Duggan stated , " I am delighted to learn that you may be down here shortly and will be willing to induct us into the mysteries of the Far East . " Correspondence also was introduced bringing in the name of the late Agnes Smedley against whom General of the Army Douglas lodged an accusation of Soviet espionage . The accusation was later ordered withdrawn by the Army . Mrs. Massing said she had known Miss Smedley and had " no doubt " about her membership in the Communist party . She said that at one time she had been told that if she accepted a Communist mission to the Orient she would " be as highly placed as Agnes Smedley . " Asked if she knew of the Army 's withdrawal of the Communist accusation she replied , " Yes , I knew about it and I was flabbergasted . " She added that Miss Smedley had been " helpful " in setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smedley died in London in May , 1950 , and willed all her possessions to Gen.

The letter , addressed to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , Washington , D. C. , of which Hiss was secretary , invited Hiss to " come along and see our shop . " The letter added , " you have done so much for the I. P. R. in cooperation and wise advice , that I am hoping this fine relationship can continue in your new post where we have so many common interests and problems . " Mr. Morris said that when the subcommittee reconvened next Tuesday he would continue to introduce evidence relating to a long list of persons having had some contact with the institute . A list containing more than eighty such names was introduced in previous testimony . Mr. Morris said he would submit evidence , relating to each of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be submitted . yrs . Massing finished her testimony before the committee adjourned . In the closing phases she said that she had recruited no Government employes other than Mr. Field and Mr. Duggan . She said , however , she had recruited many other persons here " in all walks of life . " The witness , attired in a gray print dress and a pert sailor straw hat , answered questions quickly and volubly for the moat part . She hesitated only briefly before answering questions about Mr. Duggan or about friends of her espionage days . Names Women Friends One such friend , she said , was a Helen Black , with whom she said she had lived when she came first to New York in 1933 as a fullfledged Soviet agent . She identified Miss Black as a representative of Sovfoto , then a Soviet photographic agency , in New York . Another friend , she said , was Marguerite Young , to whom she said she had become closely attached personally and professionally when she came to Washington .

" The basic qualification for these ( persons , she said , was " that they wanted to fight fascism and were friendly to the Soviet Union . " She said her first assignment on coming to the United States was as courier , transmitting microfilm from New York to a Russian agent in Pads . She said she had made " nine or ten " such trips before she was assigned as a " recruiter " in Washington . Recruitments , she said , consisted of " persuading " the persons decided on to give assistance . When they had consented to assist , they were turned over to the " apparatus " and that was generally the end of her relationship with them , she testified . Mrs. Massing said she had become interested in communism in 1921 and had trained as a Soviet agent in Moscow in 1929-31 . She said she had given up her work as a Communist agent in 1938 .
