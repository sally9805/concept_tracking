NECESSARY EVIL : THE LIFE OF JANE WELSH CARLYLE ( 618 pp. ) - Lawrence &; Ellsabefh Hanson-Macmillan ( $7.50 ) . <P> <P> Thomas Carlyle was often a boor , but never a bore . When he came courting Jane Welsh , he " made puddings in his teacup " and " scratched the fender dreadfully , " causing her to say that he should be confined in " carpet-shoes and handcuffs " with only his " tongue . . . left at liberty . " <P> " Dare you wed a wild man of the woods . " he crooned , " and come and live with him in his cavern . . . ? " Jane had often answered " Never , never ! " to such proposals . But at last she weakened and agreed , suggesting they live with her mother . To this , he growled : " The man should bear rule in the house and not the woman . This is an eternal axiom . . . It is the nature of a woman . . . to cling to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left mother , married Writer Carlyle ( on Oct. 17 , 1826 ) , and thereby set in motion a relationship that has since fascinated the literary world . Hardly a decade has passed without fresh information ( mostly in the form of letters ) , with the result that the Carlyles have begun to look like a pair of corpses which are constantly being re-exhumed to see which one had the arsenic . The virtue of this new disinterment by Lawrence &; Elisabeth Hanson ( who did a similar post-mortem on The Four Bronts ) is that it is thorough ; no one will have much excuse for doing it again . <P> Ecstatic Dyspepsia . Why should the modern reader , who seldom reads the works of Thomas Carlyle , hear so much talk about his marriage ? The answer lies in the character of Jane Carlyle . Unlike the wives of many geniuses , Jane was neither a gay deceiver nor a suet pudding ; she was a formidable intellectual , born to shine in literary and philosophical discussion . Every great man in London , from Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ; a favored few listened sympathetically to her tales of woe and discontent . <P> Husband Carlyle was made of quite different stuff . His description of his native capital , Edinburgh , more or less expressed his views on life and people generally : " Putrid , scandalous , decadent , hypocritical . " While his wife lay stunned by headaches , he groaned and paced the floor in an ecstasy of dyspepsia . " None can say how bilious I am and am like to be , " he chanted triumphantly . When somebody suggested that " the first essential was the happiness of the people , " Carlyle went half mad with rage and was found bellowing : " Happiness ! Happiness ! the fools ought to be chained up ! " <P> What held these two utterly different , passionately neurotic human beings together ? The Authors Hanson , themselves a husband &; wife team , approach the racked double bed of the Carlyle marriage with the serenity of Harley Street specialists , noting every hypochondriacal toss , turn and outburst with cool professional attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's struggle to put up with her husband 's cantankerous restlessness , her bottomless faith in his genius ; Thomas ' " absolutely unseducible " loyalty to his wife , his habit of rising to grave occasions with awe-inspiring kindliness .
