txt EISENHOWER MAPS CAUTIOUS COURSE ON SOVIET PARLEY Says U. S. Will Speak From Strength , Bar Appeasement and Not Expect Too Much THINKS PUBLIC BACKS AIM Doubts People View His Plan to Attend Big Four Talks as Appeasing Russians Transcript and summary of the news conference , Page 16. my JAMES R , EST01 ? 7 Special to Tile New Yetis Time .. WASHINGTON , May 18 ? President Eisenhower outlined today his formula for negotiating with the Russians : Speak from strength , proceed cautiously , reject appeasement and do n't expect too much . The President discussed the forthcoming meeting of the Big Four heads of government solemnly but with confidence in the mounting strength of the Western alliance . " We are approaching this thing now from a greater position of strength than we ever had before , " he said at his news conference . " We have * * * the unity of Western Europe more nearly assured than ever before . We are now , by treaty , going to have German forces . We have the Austrian treaty completed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are stronger . , But that does not mean we will be less vigilant . " For half an hour the President , who was tanned and wore a light gray summer suit , white shirt and salt-and-pepper tie , carefully balanced his determination to seek a negotiated settlement with qualifying remarks about the necessity of moving Patiently one step at a time . Appeasement Policy Denied He defined the Big Four conference as an exploratory meeting to devise ways and means of negotiating about the grievances that have divided the Communist and democratic camps and frightened the world for the last decade . And he rejected the idea that his agreement to meet with the Russians implied appeasement of any kind . Asked whether he thought the American people agreed with those members of Congress who complained that it was an act of appeasement even to go to a Big Four conference , President Eisenhower replied that he did not believe it for a minute . Appeasement means selling out the rights of other people to gain some fancied immediate end of your own , he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , " the President said , " and I just ca n't believe that America generally either wants it or * * that they suspect their Government in general is apt to fall into that trap . " General Eisenhower also dealt with another fear that has been expressed in Washington since he.agreed to meet with the leaders of the Soviet ; Union , Britain and France , namely , that the Big Four conference would raise exaggerated expectations and lead to dangerous disappointments . He said some years ago he // was struck by the fact that the ! American people had a ' weakness for swinging from extremes of optimism to pessimism , from hopes of ultimate peace to fears of war . " I believe that people havel learned , through a dozen attempts , through rebuffs , through the reading in the newspapers and hearing on the television and the radio about the process and progress of these conferences , that you do n't expect too much , " he added . The President made it clear that he was determined to ignore no chance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he felt confident the nation would understand now what was behind this stepat-a-time process . Silent on Neutral Belt Twice during the conference , reporters sought the President 's views on the Soviet Union 's attempts to create a neutral bloc of states from the Baltic to the Adriatic , including Germany , but he either evaded the question or responded only in the most general terms . He said that there seemed to be such an idea of a neutral bloc running from the north to the south of Europe , but he then went on to draw a distinction between states that were demilitarized and states that were armed but neutral . Austria has been neutralized in the sense that she is not a member of the Communist or the democratic alliances , but , like Switzerland , she will be armed , he observed . " That kind of neutrality is a far different thing from just a military vacuum , " he remarked . But he did not state any opinion about the Soviet strategy of creating a neutral bloc between the two worlds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points : There was nothing new on the Government 's statement that it would agree to direct negotiaaons with Red China on a ceasefire in the Formosa Strait . On this , it was learned elsewhere that Secretary of State Dulles had raised the question with Vyacheslav M. Molotov , Soviet Foreign Minister , in Vienna last week-end , but the Russian merely had replied that this was " an internal Chinese question . " ilHe did not think it was true to say , as some Senators here indicated recently , that the United States had lost control of the air to the Soviet Union . Cie thought United States overseas trade policy should be determined on the simple basis of whether it was , on balance , to the benefit of the United States and its Allies . would like to drop in on1 Paris and London while in Europe for the Big Four meeting , but protocol questions might make that difficult . Marshal Georgi K. Zhukov , Soviet Defense Minister , attended the Big Four meeting , it would be possible to have a personal talk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Balanced Course Sought Throughout his news conference , the President was clearly trying to strike a balance between those who wanted him to negotiate with the . Russians and those who thought such negotiations could lead only to useless or even diastrous concessions to the Soviet Union . He is going to " hunt for peace , " the President remarked , he is going to search for evidences of good faith and even for a lowering of the burdens of armament , but in the process , he is going to look out for himself . Among the subjects the President mentioned as possible points of negotiation at the Big Four meeting were the unification of Germany , the " problem of the satellite states " and the subversive operations of Moscow 's Cominform . In listing these items , the President said that he thought the Big Four would discuss how such questions should be negotiated rather than trying to negotiate solutions themselves . By his caution in discussing the European neutral bloc idea , the President reflected the attitude of prudent watchfulness that , now governs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted the coming visit of the two top Soviet leaders to Yugoslavia , the Moscow agreement to the neutralization of Austria and the repeated Communist suggestions that Germany , , too , might adopt an alliance-free policy . It is expected in official quarters here that the Russians will propose the unification and neutralization of Germany . at the Big Four meeting , but this is not likely to be considered in Washington unless the Russians also are prepared to accept the neutralization of all of the satellite states from Poland to Rumania .
