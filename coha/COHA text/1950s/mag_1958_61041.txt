GAME 1 MASTERFUL MR . SPAHN // GAME 2 BURDETTE , BRUTON AND 7 RUNS // GAME 3 THE POINT OF SOME RETURN // GAME 4 TRIUMPH AND TRAGEDY // GAME 5 STENGEL DEFIES THE ODDS // GAME 6 SAD END FOR MASTER SPAHN // At the close of our account of the fifth game of the 1958 World Series last week we said : // " Casey was still down , three games to two . He had an almost impossible job ahead , but his head was up and his voice was loud , and he was smiling as he headed for Milwaukee . " // Everyone tolerated Casey Stengel 's brave smile and admired his courageous tone of voice , but no one really believed that he and his New York Yankees had a chance . In fact , a good part of the sixth game went by before the onlookers began to realize that Stengel was not only defying the odds ( which insisted that he had only the barest hope of winning the Series ) , he was changing them . // Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Series and invincible in the fourth , was pitching against Stengel 's Yanks again , for the third time in six games . By the second inning he had a 2-1 lead  --  which should have been greater except for some fairly stupid base running on Milwaukee 's part  --  but in the sixth inning , Spahn , perhaps in subconscious reaction to his teammates ' failure to supply him with just a little better lead , just a small cushion , gave up the tying run to the Yankees on two hits , an error and a long fly ball . // Now it became suddenly obvious that Spahn , the master , was laboring , and that Stengel , no longer the underdog , was pressing him . Still Spahn pushed on , through the seventh and eighth and , finally , the ninth . He certainly had done all that anyone could have asked . He had pitched nine innings and had given up only two runs . Now , if they could score just once , the Braves could win the World Series in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out successively , dismally , depressingly , and Spahn lost the game to the first Yankee up in the 10th , Gil McDougald , who hit a home run . // He lost another run later in the inning , and the Braves scored one at last , uselessly , in their half of the 10th , but the game really ended on McDougald 's home run . Milwaukee Manager Fred Haney took Spahn out before the inning was over , and as the pitcher walked to the dugout with his brisk , athletic stride , his head down , the crowd in County Stadium rose and enveloped him in a huge , warm , appreciative roar of applause . It was only a baseball game , of course , only a childish pastime turned into adult amusement , but this was a moment to remember , this salute to a great pitcher in the time of his bitterest defeat . // As for Casey Stengel , the situation had changed . He was still smiling , but this time the onlookers could appreciate why . The odds favored him now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // And so , unbelievably , the Series came down to a seventh game . There would be no ifs in this game , no tomorrow . // Attention focused on Casey Stengel . He had never given up in this Series , not even in the disastrous fourth game in Yankee Stadium when excruciatingly bad outfielding ruined Whitey Ford 's fine pitching . That was the day he ran up the dugout steps , clapping his hands , shouting at his ballplayers , trying to keep them alive . That was the day that ended with the Yanks down , three games to one , and defeat in the Series all but certain . // But Stengel had rallied his team and had come back with two victories to tie the Series at three-all . Now all he had to do was win one more time . Faced with this problem , was he tense , worried ? Writer-Reporter Les Woodcock reported on the pre-game scene in County Stadium : // " The sky was grey as Casey Stengel took his familiar position in the Yankee dugout about an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was mobbed by reporters and , of course , he monopolized the conversation . For a man facing one of the most crucial games of his career , he seemed perfectly at ease as he talked and talked and talked . He talked about an umpire 's decision the day before . He talked about postseason trades . He talked about Yogi Berra playing golf . He talked about Ryne Duren and his glasses . He talked about ex-Yankees like Cerv , Jensen , Triandos , and how good they are now . He mentioned another ex-Yankee , ' Look at Burdette , too . He pitches pretty good . I hope he does n't today . ' // " He talked about Roy Sievers and Lou Skizas and Ted Williams . He talked about hitting . He talked about Don Larsen and how well he could hit and what a good first baseman he might make . He talked about the scouting reports he had received on the Braves . He joked about his lineups for the day ( he 'd made out a couple and when they accidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up quickly , saying , I do n't want you fellas to see the names I juggled around ' ) . Of the game , the vital seventh game , he said : I feel better than I did earlier in the Series . I 'm glad it went this far . My boys felt pretty good the last few days . Now they 're either going to have a good winter or a bad winter . It depends in five hours . ' // " The sun came out at 12:05 as Stengel was talking . The sky brightened , and the few clouds overhead eventually drifted away during the game . " // Casey was relaxed , but the game itself was very tense until the eighth inning . At any rate the Braves were tense . They scored a run in the first and then left the bases loaded in that inning and again in the third . In his running notes on the game , Writer-Reporter Walter Bingham commented : " That first inning was a moral victory for the Yanks . There could have been much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if Burdette is sharp it may be hard to get it back . " // But the Yanks got it back the next inning , and one extra to boot . The Braves were beginning to look hysterical . Two successive errors were charged to First Baseman Frank Torre on throws he made to Burdette when Burdette was slow in getting over to first in time to cover . These errors , plus a walk , filled the bases , and an infield grounder and a fly ball gave the Yankees two runs . // THAT GOOD FIELDING // But where fidgety fielding hurt the Braves , great plays by the Yankees ' Gil McDougald and Jerry Lumpe stopped Milwaukee from scoring in the third . Bill Bruton led off with a single . And Torre followed with a high pop fly to right . Hank Bauer was playing way too deep and could not get in to it . So McDougald , running out from second base , had to catch the pop with his back to home plate . When Henry Aaron followed with a line single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had halted the Yankee retreat by pitching a shutout in the fifth game , and who had relieved in the 10th inning of the sixth game to get the final out with the tying and winning runs on base . Turley stopped the Braves now , for a third time , but he needed that good fielding . Covington tapped in front of the plate and was out at first , Berra to Skowron , but when Berra came out to field the ball Turley forgot to cover home plate , and Bruton , rounding third , made a threat to come all the way in to score . Skowron promptly threw hard to third in an attempt to pick Bruton off , and threw wild . But Lumpe , playing third , made a diving backhand catch of the ball to hold Bruton on third , restore order and preserve the Yankee lead . A minute or so later , with the bases loaded ( this was the second time ) , Crandall hit the ball hard through the middle ; Turley deflected it ; and McDougald , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , charged in , picked up the ball barehanded and threw to first in time to get Crandall for the third out . It was the third impressive , cool-headed Yankee fielding play of the inning . // In the sixth Crandall , with no one on base this time , hit a high arching home run just beyond the left field fence to tie the score at 2-2 . For a moment hope revived in Milwaukee , but two innings later , with the score still tied , the weary Burdette met the strongest part of the Yankee batting order and his ultimate defeat . // He got McDougald on a soft fly to right and struck out Mantle . But then , as Walter Bingham described it at the time in his notes : " Berra pulls soft liner down foul line which hits rubber about four feet from top of fence for a double . Howard at 1-1 chops single through middle to score Berra . Yanks lead 3-2 . Carey hits ball to deep short for infield single . Moose Skowron can break open game . Swinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . High ball two . Moose clinches the World Series with a three-run homer . Kubek strikes out . " // There was a ninth inning , but no one really cared . The score was 6-2 , the Yankees were in , and the Braves were utterly defeated . // Afterward Casey Stengel told the TV cameras : " I 'll tell you the reason why we won and there were three reasons . " He pursued this theme for some time and the pursuit was fascinating , if confusing . But when all was said and done , the biggest reasons why the Yankees won were almost certainly the heart and the fight of old Casey himself .
