Deputy Defense Secretary Roger Kyes 's first piece of fan mail after he took over his broad oak desk in the Pentagon last February was a postcard from a Tennessean who , after seeing Kyes 's picture in the paper , wrote : " You look to me as though you could spit in the devil 's eye . " Big ( 6 ft. 4 in. , 225 Ibs. ) , craggy Roger Kyes* makes a similar impression on people who encounter him face to face . After meeting him for the first time , a Pentagonian remarked : " He looks like the kind of guy who 'd say , ' Lay off 40,000 men . ' " Kyes has not yet said , " Lay off 40,000 men , " but he did order a cut in Defense Department replacement hiring , with the result that normal outflow has reduced employment by just about 40,000 . <P> Kyes needs toughness for the job he has to do . Kyes , his boss , Charles Erwin Wilson , and Wilson 's boss , Dwight Eisenhower , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per dollar of expenditure . But the Defense Department is so vast , so complex and so procedure-ridden that to grab it and shake out some of its abundant water takes a man with both managerial talent and toughness . Kyes has both . He is calm and affable , but when Pentagonians call him " Jolly Roger " they mean not that he is jolly but that he is as tough as a pirate . <P> Roger Martin Kyes , 47 , brought no military experience to Washington . But he did bring a lot of experience in managing men and expediting production . Farmborn , and still vaguely rustic despite Harvard ( ' 28 ) and a high standard of living , he worked up to the presidency of Harry Ferguson , Inc. ( tractors and farm implements ) , then moved to General Motors , became a vice president and the general manager of the Truck and Coach Division . When G.M. President Erwin Wilson was tabbed as Defense Secretary , he asked Kyes to be his No. 2 man . Kyes gave up his $85,000 salary ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock . When he learned that his new job would pay $20,000 and Wilson 's $22,500 , he remarked : " Well , I never thought I would get within $2,500 of C. E. Wilson . " <P> Wilson , occupied with high-level huddles , left most of the Pentagon intramural work to Kyes . Some Kyes policies : tighter correlation of production schedules : use whenever possible of standard civilian goods ( e.g. , trucks ) instead of specially-designed items ; channeling production contracts to low-cost producers . <P> The new job keeps Kyes busy . He gets to the Pentagon before 8:30 a.m. , seldom leaves before 10 p.m . When he went to Washington , he expected to be busy for a while , so he left his wife and four daughters behind in suburban Bloomfield Hills , Mich . They are still there . <P> <P> *Who recently startled a woman at a cocktail party by saying cheerfully : " I 'm Roger Kyes , the ugliest-looking man in Washington . "                @ @ @ @ @
