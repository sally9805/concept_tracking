txt WASHINGTON , Sept. 26 --  , President Eisenhower 's Cabinet was summoned today to a Friday meeting at the White House . It appeared to be the first step toward setting up the mechanics for conducting Government business during the President 's illness . Vice President Richard M. Nixon announced the Cabinet session after a luncheon conference with top aides or the President . These included Sherman Adams , the assistant to . the President to whom General Eisenhower has delegated some administrative and decisionmaking powers in the past . The Cabinet meeting will be preceded on Thursday by a meeting of the National Security Council , top policy body for foreign affairs and defense . This meeting was scheduled before the President suffered a heart attack , but it took on added // NIXON ON WAY TO WHITE HOUSE : Vice President Richard M. Nixon enters the White House grounds to have lunch with Sherman Adams , assistant to the President . CABINET MEETING CALLED BY NIXON // significance for the immediate future . Mr. Nixon will preside at both meetings . He spent three hours in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilton B. Persons , the deputy assistant to the President , Gerald D. Morgan , special counsel to the President , and William P. Rogers Jr. , Acting Attorney General . Brownell Speeds Back Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. , cut a week from his European vacation to return to Washington . He left Madrid today by plane and was scheduled to arrive tomorrow . Mr. Adams flew into the capital this morning from a vacation in Europe . As these top officials made plans for carrying out the President 's policies , there were the following developments : qkr . Rogers said , " it may not be necessary to make any formal delegation of powers " to other officials while the President is temporarily unable to perform the duties of his office . He did not elaborate . A Justice Department spokesman said an opinion of the question probably would be ready late this week . The opinion was requested by the summer White House in Denver . IIt was understood that Mr. Brownell would attend the Thursday meeting of the Security Council , presumably to discuss the delegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council that includes the President , Mr. Nixon , Secretary of State John Foster Dulles , Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson and Arthur S. Flemming , Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization. fiSecretary of the Treasury George M. Humphrey , in a statement aimed at countering the stock market break , asserted " there is no reason to anticipate any change " in the Administration 's policies and programs . ' We ** Carry On ' " We will carry on during his the President 's absence exactly as previously planned , " Mr. Humphrey assured . Pointedly , he added : " There is no reason for others to . do otherwise . " His statement that the President 's team would carry on " as previously planned " bolstered a belief here that the President had discussed and laid out a course of action to meet the present contingency . Mr. Nixon ' has declined to comment on whether such plans had been made in Cabinet meetings . It also served to strengthen a belief that for the immediate future at least the conduct of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humphrey was likely to assume a key role . This stems from his influence on financial policy , at a time when business appeared jittery ; and his closeness to the President . There are no precedents for the delegation of Presidential powers to other officials , either elected or appointed . The legal and constitutional questions arose but were not resolved in the administrations of James A. Garfield and Woodrow Wilson . These were the only two Presidents unable to discharge their duties for any considerable length of time . Two Presidents Disabled President Garfield was shot by ' an assassin in Buffalo on July 2 , 1881 . He died the following Sept. 19 . President Wilson was stricken with a paralytic stroke in Wichita , Kan. , during a speaking tour . to defend the Versailles Treaty of World War I. Mr. Nixon and White House aides brushed aside the question of " who 's boss ? " while the President was laid up . Mr. Nixon said at his home this morning that " it is quite clear that the Attorney General must give an inter= pretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled during the time the President is ' He said he referred to the signing of some official papers and documents . The tedious routine of signing official papers is vested in the President by law , but General Eisenhower succeeded in cutting down some signature work . For example , he turned over to the Secretary of Defense the task of signing commissions in the armed forces . Beyond these technicalities , however , the Administration was faced with mapping action to meet such major problems as decisions on and during the forthcoming Foreign Ministers Conference in Geneva . In the meantime , it appeared that administration officials in Washington were marking time until the Cabinet meeting and further reports from Denver and Presidential aides there . Trips to Denver Uncertain Mr. Adams said that he did not know whether he would go to Denver . Mr. Nixon , who canceled plans to go to Denver tomorrow , said this afternoon he had " no comment " on that subject now , but added " I will be in Washington this week . " ' General Persons likewise declined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon , who for the moment has become the fountainhead for the actions to date . He announced ' the White House . meeting and had the White House issue a brief statement on today 's session . The statement said only that the Cabinet and Security Council meetings would be held and that " the Vice President stated that the subjects on the agenda for these meetings were of a normal routine nature . " He did not disclose whether he had talked with Herbert Hoover Jr. , the Under Secretary of State , or with Nelson Rockefeller , a special assistant to the President . Both entered the White House during the luncheon conference . The White House also was silent and there was no press liaison except for the brief statement that was handed out by secretaries in the office.of James C. Hagerty , press secretary , who is in Denver . Gruenther in Washington Mr. Adams flew to Washington in a military airplane with General Alfred M. Gruenther , Supreme Allied Commander in Europe . General Gruenther said he had been scheduled to visit at home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President . But , he added , he thought ' the President 's condition " would make it most inadvisable to have a visitor at this time . " There were few members of Congress on Capitol Hill where the major topic still was the President 's heart attack and the political future for the Republicans . The offices of b8th Republican and Democratic Congressional leaders said they had receiyed no word beyond public statements . Mr , Nixon left his home this morning without a Secret Service detail al 9:07 o'clock , Eastern standard time , and arrived at his office in the Senate Office Building at 9:25 . He spent the morning in his office except for a brief appearance before television and newsreel cameras in the Senate Banking Committee room . Has No Plans to Move The 42-year-old Vice President reiterated for the cameras his statement of yesterday that the President 's well-defined policies and Government business would be carried out without delay . He said he had no plans to move or enlarge his staff after reporters told him it had been suggested he move to Blair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House . Mr. Nixon went home about 6:30 P. M. He said he had no plans for the evening , but that he expected to keep hi touch with Denver .
