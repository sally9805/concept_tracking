 | Our Third Automobile Revolution LATE IN 1957 a General Motors executive in Detroit rereceived a cablegram from the i rm 's Australian headquarters seeking approval for several large appropriations for machine tools . This ablegram was a complete fake -- fabricated to convey the impression 0 snoopers that General Motors was tooling up for a new small car in Australia . Actually , General Motors was then secretly working on the Corvair , the new " compact car " which , along with Ford 's Falcon Ind Chrysler 's Valiant , is now reaching the market . The spurious cable was part of what was probably the most extensive cover-up program ever staged by Detroit 's automobile manufacturers . Unable to hide the fact that a tremendous amount of special work was going on , General Motors chose to make it appear that the GM activity was connected with its small  | Australian car , the Holden . All work on the new car went by the code-name Holden . There was continual correspondence to and from Australia about the progress of " the Holden project . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppliers were instructed to quote prices f.o.b . San Francisco ? as if the items were to be shipped abroad . All this hocus-pocus is understandable . Huge stakes are involved in the entry of General Motors , Ford and Chrysler into the " compact car " field . Everyone who can read , look at television or listen to radio now knows about the cars themselves ? smaller , lighter , cheaper and more economical to operate . But few persons outside the industry may realize that , altogether , the investment in the new cars probably exceeds 450 million dollars . ( Just one fender die for the Falcon cost two million dollars . ) Or that , for the first time in automotive history , all the major manufacturers have simultaneously gone into quantity production of a new type of car , each with a new engine . These new cars represent the third revolution in American automotive products . Revolution I came in 1908 when Henry Ford built the Model T , which provided basic transportation at low cost . By turning out a car anyone could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II ? actually an evolution ? was the concentration of the major manufacturers exclusively on Big Cars . The product got longer , wider , more powerful , with more extras and higher price tags . This revolution reached its climax when the " low-priced three " ? Ford , Chevrolet and Plymouth ? became almost as big , powerful and costly as the others . Revolution III finds the Big Three producing two types : smaller , corn pact cars as well as the big ones . The major producers are now aiming at consumers who primarily want economy , along with reasonable comfort and performance , as well as at consumers who primarily want size and power . What led to the Big Three 's decision to develop economy cars ? One common explanation is tha these manufacturers were awak ened suddenly by increased sales i 1957-58 of foreign cars and of th American Motor Co. ' s Rambler , an thereupon worked feverishly to pr duce smaller cars of their own . The ' glib answer does n't square wt what went on behind the scenes 1 Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States climbe from 98,000 in 1956 to 377,000 in 19 ( and to 289,000 in the first half 1959 ) . And Rambler sales went fro 70,000 in 1956 to 186,000 in 1958 ( an to 176,000 in the first half of 1959 But the fact is that the major man facturers were charting the smaller car market before these sales i creases took place , and were tryin to determine when the marke would be big enough for them t enter on a mass-production bast Many of their major decisions an  | much of their development work on economy cars came before these dramatic sales increases . A well-known publication recently cited the immediate popularity of the Lark , a smaller car introduced last autumn by Studebaker-Packard , A major factor which " inspired c Big Three to get into the cornet-car market . " Before the Lark as on the market , however , Ford was ordering dies for its economy car and General Motors was building a new assembly plant . The Big Three kept their new-car plans sect primarily because they feared at premature talk would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been observed for some time by automobile manufacturers . One : the gap was widening tween the prices of American made cars and consumer incomes ; r prices were going up much fastr . The other : the gap was widening tween prices of American-made nd European-made cars . Automobile-company economists came to the conclusion that these two gaps would get still wider . One reason : automotive wages were inleasing in Europe as well as in the sited States , but European producion volume was increasing so fast that it could offset the higher wages . Ours was n't . In 1958 , for the first lime , more automobiles were manufactured outside the United States than inside it . It was back in June 1952 , when foreign cars were not getting even one percent of the American market ( they got eight percent in 1958 ) , that General Motors assigned 65 engineers and technicians to begin two types of " smaller car " studies : one on configuration , one on materials . At that time , Ford had a small-car project with the code name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineering prototypes that year , decided against domestic production , brought the car out in 1954 in France as the Vedette . Meanwhile , Chrysler was also designing and building experimental small cars . The configuration group at General Motors , working quietly in the new auditorium of Detroit 's huge GM Building , decided on a rear engine and built five test cars . The materials group , put to work in a nearby vacated bank , did the exploratory work out of which came the company 's decision that it must have an aluminum foundry . The result is the aluminum plant which General Motors opened on the St. Lawrence Seaway last spring . Late in 1954 Chevrolet 's general manager held a meeting in the auditorium , listened to the engineering reports , made a decision to build ten representative models combining the best ideas . By the fall of 1957 the key decision was made to build prototypes of a new car : exact proposed production models . Sixty days later the GM executive committee decided to be ready to bring the car out in the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary tooling-up , including construction LI '  | of a new assembly plant at Willow Run . Altogether , this was a decision in the too-million-dollar range . To throw industrial spies off the track , the prototypes were built with some fake characteristics ? for example , a grille to make the car look as if it had a front engine . Also , fake fins and extra rear lights were put on . Then the car was taken for tests which included the Los Angeles freeways , the San Francisco hills , the grades around Yosemite . One car was tested in 3o-degree-below-zero weather in northern Minnesota and in 12o-degree heat in Arizona . It towed the equivalent of a trailer across the Mojave Desert . Chrysler 's Valiant was road-tested in remote sections of northern Michigan ? after the new cars , equipped with false hoods and rear ends , were hauled to the test areas at night in a moving van . Ford dispensed with disguises , simply left the name plates off its Falcons , and sent them out on the highways for daytime tests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign make . One was driven cross-country to San Francisco , another to Florida ; another spent days on the winding back roads of Kentucky . Usually these test cars were parked at night with trusted dealers , but several times this past summer , when photos of the new cars were being avidly sought , a Falcon was parked overnight at a motel in Kentucky . Earlier , Ford 's security measures had been more stringent . The basic document out of which came its decision to manufacture a corn car was a report of which only It a dozen copies were made , trusted hands . As soon as the cision was reached , all copies w ordered shredded and then burn All work on the Falcon carr the code name " 19XK Thum bird " which , as hoped , led to fa rumors that Ford 's new car won be a six-cylinder stripped-down v sion of its Thunderbird . The t key men working on the project It special wastebaskets with padlock so that no data could leak o through discarded scraps of paper . At Chrysler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting out t new car was turned over to a 2 man team of body , chassis , electri design and production experts w were housed in a specially lea building 2%Z miles from the co pany 's engineering center . Th project was called A-901 , and t had to have special passes to get i the building . As a result , ma Chrysler employes did n't kn there was such a team , and ma who did assumed it was working a secret military project . The three new compact cars all original automobiles , not scal down Fords , Chevrolets and Ply ouths . Each engineering tea sought constantly to simplify deli and reduce weight . Thousands conventional parts and assembly were redesigned . For example , F engineers found a way to make Falcon door-frame with two pa rather than 12 , the door with  | parts rather than the usual 21 . The naming of the new cars is a story in itself . The Corvair got its name the way many racehorses have by combining syllables from the names of sire and dam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bel Air . Falcon was selected partly because goes neatly with Ford 's ThunderBird . One newspaper reported that both Ford and Chrysler had decided use the name Falcon , and that Ford won out by 20 minutes ' prior registration with the Automobile Manufacturers Association . Both companies deny this . They say that , until Ford registered it , Chrysler had Falcon on a list of possible names , and thought it was theirs cause of prior use on an experimental car . Chrysler reports that at one time it had a list of over 2000 possible names , some suggested by men working on the secret project , others produced by experimenting with all possible combinations of certain letters . This list was narrowed down to 100 , then to 20 , eventually to five : Revere , Chelsea , Columbia , Liberty and Valiant . Then interviewing cams pumped consumers for their reactions to each name , what it connoted , which ones suggested the image of an automobile rather than . i cake mix . How many of the new cars will be sold ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Detroit is 1,100,000 during the first year . Larger sales than that are predicted by George Romney , the dynamic head of American Motors , who fervently preached the doctrine of the compact car while increasing sales of the Rambler tenfold in five years . Romney expects . the sales of Corvairs , Falcons , Valiants , Ramblers and Larks to total il ! P two million during the 196o model u year . By 1965 , he predicts , the compact car will take more than half of the American market , outselling both the Big Cars of U. S. makes and the Small Cars from abroad . Most executives are chary of predictions , simply ask questions . Will the new compact cars curtail sales of foreign cars in the United States ? Will American Motors and Studebaker-Packard , which have had difficulty competing with the Big Three 's large cars , be able to compete successfully with the Big Three 's compact cars ? Will the compact cars bring modifications in the Big Cars ? Will they eventually lead the Big Three to enter the SmallCar market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The one certainty is that the coming year will be the most interesting and , possibly , the most significant in modern American automobile history .
