The toughening attitude of management in union bargaining , which showed up in the U.A.W.-automakers talks , was demonstrated again last week by General Electric . After seven weeks of bargaining with James Carey 's International Union of Electrical Workers , G.E . walked out of the meetings vowing not to return . <P> The talks were a security-benefits re-opener of the five-year contract ( to 1960 ) , and the union wanted to discuss fringe benefits , including higher layoff pay . Instead , G.E . offered a new security-and-savings plan , based on a worker 's earnings , to be financed by lowering automatic pay boosts . For every $1 contributed by an employee ( up to 6% of his earnings ) , G.E . offered to contribute 50 , invest the money in G.E . stock or U.S. savings bonds . G.E . computed that a worker making $5,000 per year would have as much as $5,281 worth of bonds in his savings fund after ten years . The plan got nowhere with high-voltage Jim Carey , who last January called the recession an obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme to drive up the price of G.E . stock , enriching top executives who " have secured stock free of charge as part of their profit sharing . " Said G.E . Vice President Lemuel R. Boulware : " Carey is unable to distinguish between bargaining and giving in . Three years ago we gave in . Not now . " What strengthened G.E . ' s hand was the fact that in three key G.E . locals ( Lynn and Pittsfield , Mass. ; Schenectady , N.Y. ) , representing more than a third of the union 's dues-paying membership , Carey could not get a strike vote . Though more than 40 other locals backed Carey , he was clearly not sure just where he stood . At the I.U.E. convention last month , he got the union 's strike-vote clause changed from a required two-thirds of membership to a simple majority . " I have the authority to strike , " he said last week , " but not the backing I think I need . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
