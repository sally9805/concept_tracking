the whims of kings and sheiks and governments . Its transport routes are also subject to the turbulence of hole countries writhing with new nationalisms . Thus Nasser alone can , at least temporarily , chill the London pub and stall the Paris taxi . Close Suez and instantly the available Middle East oil en route to Europe is cut in half because the route is nearly doubled in length . But Nasser or no Nasser , the long-run prospect is that more and more floating oil cans will be seen on all the seas for years to come . Accordingly the trade served by that slightly peculiar sailor , the tankerman , hill broaden , and as his slightly peculiar vessels multiply , the tankerman will become more numerous . What sort of life is this and what sort of ships are these ? On the Huntington , which carries a complement of forty-five men , there arc forty-five opinions . Basically , of course , the tanker is a vessel of the sea and its crew and officers must be men of the sea . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freighter . But on closer look it bears a hallmark , an elevated catwalk that traverses its decks lengthwise . The decks themselves are not quite decks . They are , rather , orderly mazes of large pipes , small pipes and valves , with the catwalk providing a narrow fore-to-aft boulevard above the clutter . The larger pipes direct cargo to tanks below , the smaller pipes are a built-in fire department of steam or chemicals or water . We are a large ship . fast , clean , and with an extra dash of color on the decks where valves and lines are color-coded for quick recognition . If there were no other way of differentiating us from a cargo freighter , we would know it as we left the dock , for the tanker slips away in relative quiet . There is no roar and rumble of hatch covers sliding into place because there are no hatches , and there is no hammering of wedges to tighten covers against the seas to come . Our loading , too , was unseen and noiseless , There was no squeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cargo into yawning holds . From somewhere back in the refinery our cargo was pumped through hoses on the dock connecting with the pipes on our deck . When we were fully loaded , the dock hoses , thick as a man 's head . were speedily disconnected and hoisted out of the way . Loading or discharging a tanker is quick work . In a dozen hours an amount equal to 3 per cent of the nation 's daily production can be pumped aboard . Thus the old-timer comments , " You can always tell a tankerman ashore . He hurries . Always hurry , not enough time . He jogs to stores , to family or girl , to bars , and back to the ship . " He was exaggerating slightly , as was the crew member who said of the ship , " We roll more at sea . We got a fat bottom , not so sharp in the keel as a cargo ship , and so we get more roll . " It may be true . but the loaded tanker also rides low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is customary for a fair sea to wash over her belly , and heavy seas will even overrun the elevated catwalk , isolating the mid-ships structure and bridge from the mess-rooms and quarters in the after deckhouse . Any ship fears fire , but the " no-smoking " signs on a tanker are the biggest printing aboard , blazing over the decks in letters larger than the ship 's name . Obvi- TH ously the ever-present normal hazards of t hesea are increased when the cargo ranges from flammable to explosive . But caution and prevention measures also increase . Roughly , the risks arc greater at docks and in confined waters of heavy traffic , but even at sea the no-smoking rule is enforced on the open deck . Out at sea , collision is the only likely risk , and it is an extreme rarity . But incredibly enough , a few years back two Esso ships in the Gulf of Mexico rammed together with resultant fire and tragedy . At the loading or discharge dock the tanker becomes a mass of precautions . Deckhouse walls are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be opened , portholes are closed , and buckets of water for dousing cigarettes stand at every exit that might possibly be used . Even apertures for small ventilation fans are closed off  --  everyone remembers the porthole fan in the steward 's cabin on one ship . It was neglected and it admitted fumes . When the steward struck a match , believing himself safe behind the steel deckhouse wall , a tier of cabins was instantly ripped from the structure and a tank was ignited . Such fires can be and are mastered , but it is hurry-up work . By tankerman yardstick , a burning tank needs just five minutes to heat and ignite its neighbor . On the Huntington we have thirty tanks , or steel compartments , in the big steel bulb which is the ship itself . Of these thirty , a band of three tanks across our middle is empty because we are a little rubbery under the great weight of our cargo . We need the empty bubble in the middle for buoyancy to keep us from becoming more sway-back than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds . The surface of this oily lake within our seagoing envelope must be kept approximately level , hence the Huntington 's powE // erful pumps can pump it around from cubicle to cubicle , a movement that is sometimes necessary . For example , our two high-pressure boilers burn enough oil from their bunkers in the stern to lift our tail two inches a day . Unless we are to dip our nose too deeply because of this lightening of the stern , cargo must be shifted aft to balance and level the internal lake , The man who keeps the figures on this trim , or balance , is chief officer  --  a modern term for first mate  --  Rolf Clausen . Clausen , a Norwegian-born American , has a home and family in Florida , as do several other members of our complement of forty-five . Florida is not d'particularly handy home site for tankermen in the Gulf-to-Atlantic service . But there is a resortlike attraction to the state that invites the tankermen on their solid month of time off with pay every ninety days . Families also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back of every tanker-man 's mind is the additional fact that it is possible to retire from tanking pretty early in life . The company makes available to the men thrift and pension plans . The thrift plan affords an opportunity to purchase stock of the parent company , Standard Oil of New Jersey , a so-called blue chip of the New York Stock Exchange . Accordingly there is an impressive affinity between the tankerman and the stock market . A crew member confides that , " Soand-So is only forty-one and he 's already got nearly a thousand shares of Jersey in his sock . I bet he retires after a few more trips  --  and confidentially , I wo n't be far behind him . " Our ship is American-manned , under the American flag and under the thumb of Coast Guard regulations . There are great divisions of opinion on whether this life , with the ship never more than a week from port , is better than the long voyages in foreign trade . " That third month on duty is like Siberia , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regrets the absence of exotic foreign scenes and foreign women in strictly American coastal travel . But the family men , who outnumber the bachelors aboard , mostly lean the other way . Some of them have had their fill of distant service . Second assistant engineer Donald Johnson , for example , has seen enough of the Pacific . A down-Easter from Maine , 90 per cent of whose high-school class went to sea , Johnson has moved his New England family to Baytown , Texas , a loading port of frequent call . He is delighted with the time he now gets to spend at home . Chief engineer Walter Gillam , originally from Oregon , is one of several Staten Islanders aboard the Huntington . When the ship is docked at Bayway , New Jersey , Staten Island is a mere step away , and even in twelve hours he can spend a little time at home with his wife , grown daughter and a pampered old dog . Somewhere in the middle is John Danko , first assistant engineer . He is a bachelor and would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , he has built up a lot of seniority and equity in the coastwise service and his shore arrangements please him . He went to sea because his brother had gone before him . Now the brother has retired in New Jersey and in his time off John helped build a two-car garage at the brother 's home . Half of it is his to use for his own car , and there is also an extra room that he helped build . Accordingly he has a short-stop headquarters or , on his month off , he can pick up his automobile and drive out to Western Pennsylvania for big family gatherings . The carpentering ability of Danko and his brother is not at all unusual among tankermen . A tanker has little use for a carpenter and we carry none . There is no cargo to secure , shore up , chock or bulwark . A piece of timber is a rarity . But half the ship 's men have do-it-yourself projects under way at home . The third assistant engineer , a former chief engineer who returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keeps enlarging an already large house in Florida . The crew messman is finishing another Florida house , and so is able seaman Nowlan . Nowlan holds a second mate 's papers , but because so many ships were transferred to foreign registry a few years ago , he has n't been able to work at his qualified rating . He does n't like it , but he wants to finish his house . Danko is a popular man with his colleagues , but he has behind him one experience no one wants to share with him . We were reminded of it at the dock in Baton Rouge . where another tanker , the Esso Paterson , was berthed just behind us . Danko had once served aboard the Paterson . He was aboard it at a dock , talking to the chief engineer one day , when the deck behind the chief suddenly curled erect , a seventeen-ton piece of hull was blown out onto the shore and flames leaped 300 feet into the air , Some men jumped and some were hurt doing it , Some raced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in the ship 's security measures , undertook to get the fire-smothering equipment to work . They did . working themselves to exhaustion in a matter of minutes , assisted by several crew members and dock workers , until the dangerous blaze was contained . The engine-room crew remained at their posts . When John Danko now says that the ships defense system can control fires , he means it . Once in open water , the tanker life becomes much more like that of any ship.except that smoking on deck is forbidden . There is deck maintenance to be done  --  chipping , scraping and painting . Captain Bligh would spin in his grave to know that we carry two deck hands who are day men , working the same sort of daylight hours that prevail in a suburban real-estate office or a department store . The costumes , however , are different . This is an informal ship and as we rip off eighteen and a half knots between Florida and Cuba , nosing for the Gulf Stream and an additional few knots , shirts disappear and shorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by accident rather than tailoring , for in almost every case the shorts are simply work pants which have worn out at the knees and been promptly guillotined at that point . Even the bos'n wears this truncated variety , and in addition sports a knee-length pair of golf socks . Laundry is an individual project . There are washing machines both in the midship house where most of the officers live and in the after-house . The forty-five aboard make an easygoing family , and distinctions in rank can hardly be recognized by dress or behavior . Any crew member is welcome in the intermittent but eternal low-stakes poker game held in recreation or mess room of the crew quarters . Shirts and shoes are optional attire . Other entertainment is limited to radio , but television is soon to be installed . Letter writing , not so frequent as if the trips were longer , sometimes produces a batch worth special mailing . In that event a floating sack is prepared and as the Huntington passes through the Florida Straits it is tossed overboard . There is always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to shore , collecting a modest tip included in the sack . The gossip about sister ships and jobs and colleagues and home projects is interminable . Able seaman John Merck , of Arkansas , can spin an Arkansas yarn that entertains everyone but Roy Sedgebeer , his roommate . The two are cronies , but Sedgebeer , with a straight face , complains of Merck that " the blankety blank should clean up his language . " It is reported that second mate Paddy Brown , of Massachusetts , a successful raiser of chinchillas , is planning to teach his animals to chirp in a good Irish brogue , which he favors himself , although his three brothers speak pure Jersey . At least two of the ship 's complement are actively planning real-estate deals that amount to small subdivisions in widely separated Atlantic Coast states . But when it is time for home-office messages about who is to take off for a month at the end of the current trip , radio officer Pat Dougherty suddenly becomes the center of all ship conversation and attention . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single can of lighter fluid , no alcohol ( barred ) , but a quantity of coffee that seemingly rivals the cargo . There is a hot plate on the bridge that carries two coffeepots . The big urn in the pantry , aft , is always full and available . There are snacks and fresh fruit on tap in both deckhouses . There are also three regular meals a day in each of three messrooms  --  officers ' , petty officers ' and crew 's . All three messes are served the same food from the same galley and about the only difference is that the seats in the officers ' mess arc the least comfortable . Meals aboard the Huntington are leisurely , the diners popping in when it suits them within the hour limit on each meal . The menu is abundant and varied , and if our chef has too light a hand with the salt and seasoning , that can be repaired at table . Steak appears once a week , there is a choice of two or three entrees at each meal , fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The steward who manages this food service has two cooks in the electric galley , three messmen , and below decks a storeroom , a cool room and a freezer room . He is Nicolaas Vriesema , born in Holland and possessed of remarkable energy after forty-Iwo years at sea . As he looks back he finds that more than food has changed at sea over the years . " When I was first a cabin boy out of Holland I wanted to get ahead , to be a cook . But the cook would n't show me anything . He would n't let me watch him . So I had to climb up and watch him through the skylight , making notes on his recipes . Now everybody is willing to teach the next fellow and help him . It is better this way . " Nicolaas is a big man and when he takes a helpful interest in anyone 's prob tem , it is a little like being mothered by a full-grown buffalo . He has a home and family in Baltimore , a daughter 's wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only tankerman 's jacket to be seen on this tanker . If Vriesema 's department is what the Huntington feeds on , the route and the over-all responsibility for the ship lie at the top of the midships house where Master Hubert Lovelace Hassel is in command . This is the bridge , known as Hassel 's Castle while he is aboard , and it is the most delightful place on the ship for the simple reason that Captain Hassel and his dry , sly humor are present . The old man  --  and this is a respectful term for any ship 's master  --  is well over six feet , quite handsome in an aquiline way and considering his close-to-retirement age , and is so well acquainted with the sea after more than four decades that he treats it as a mischievous child . Captain Hassel was born on Saba Island , a remnant of a volcanic cone in the Dutch West Indies . Saba is one of the Leeward Islands , just southeast of our Virgin Islands , and not many people can boast of it as a natal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there now . It is an unlikely bit of land , five square miles of it , and the only part that is not rock cliff is the floor of the old crater . This can be reached from the sea only by climbing 800 feet of steps cut out of the sides of the cone . " I started at the bottom , " the captain explains , and a little later it turns out that the one and only community on Saba , occupying the crater floor , is called Bottom . Saba , the old man says , has many great opportunities for young men , as long as they leave there . The captain left forty-four years ago  --  he has been a master since 1920 ? but he still returns and he is still fond of the home island . There are still relatives there , probably more than he knows , since the major early families on Saba were the Hasscls , the Everys and the Simmonses . " When I go back and someone says to me , ' Your cousin was asking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , give him my regards , ' and then I shake hands with the next man I meet . What has one Hassel got to say to another Hassel , anyway ? " The captain is the exact opposite of the roaring , blustering master of sea fiction . When he tours the ship daily , he nods and smiles gently on all the crew , and if there are signs of neglect anywhere , he waits and sadly notifies the proper officer in his quarters later . On the bridge , a gaunt , lanky figure , he lopes back and forth , with just the right timing to make his listener wonder whether or not he really means what he has just said . The constantly squawking ship-to-Coast-Guard radio , a pretty good form of entertainment in itself , picks up a drawling interchange on the lower Mississippi . " Cap'n , " it says , " do I understand you to mean you-all are stuck on the bank ? " " Oh , no . We 're amovin ' , " There is a burst of laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " I 'm glad , " he says . " It 's bad form  --  you know , definitely not the best cricket  --  to get stuck on the bank . " Captain Hassel 's cool-weather-and-fog costume consists of khaki pants , a chamois jacket resembling that of Nanook of the North , and a French Legionnaire cap . Since Baton Rouge is about 240 miles and three separate pilots from the mouth of the Mississippi and since fog dogs us all the way , the captain wears this costume the first night and day out of our loading port , A river pilot is aboard , but when the vital range lights on the banks begin to wink and become wispy , the capMarch is , 1957 tain lopes a little faster . It is a big river , but tankers are acutely sensitive to bumps and scrapes . The pilot is conning the ship . He is also an old friend of the old man 's . Captain Hassel poses a purely idle question to the pilot . " Captain , " he says , " do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our pilot is not going to be baited by this irrelevant talk . He ignores it . But a little later we swing our bow upstream into the current , drop the anchor and wait a couple of hours for a break in the gray stuff . The weather is better in the morning , and after picking up a few mosquitoes in the Southwest Pass , we are out in the Gulf . It is time for Captain Hassel to break out a new uniform . He appears in a dark blue beret , apparently ready to face the Australians and take the Davis Cup to France . " It is not so handsome as a hairpiece , " the old man explains , " but it is easier to tip . " All the Huntington 's men arc to some degree aware of the new stature of tankers in the world of salt water . The Liberian flag and the Panamanian flag , favorites of the tanker trade , are more frequently seen in the Gulf loading ports . Foreign flags at Baytown , Texas , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months ago . It is beginning to be clearly apparent that about one half of the world 's tankers normally carry oil to Western Europe , now that they have turned to us for oil . It is estimated that by 1965 the world 's tonnage of tankers will double , and that by 1975 it will triple . By that time Captain Hassel 's profession will have greatly expanded , but the old man will have retired to his Long Island home or to California , there to look back on the two times he was torpedoed , or the hurricanes that drove him off his course . And the Huntington , if it is still in service , will be one of the smaller ships in the tanker trade . It still looks pretty big , though , as we pick our way with a tanker 's caution up Chesapeake Bay in fog-blanketed predawn hours . The radio picks up conversations from a few miles ahead andthen a few miles beyond that . The pilot takes heart from reports that up there the visibility is a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will agree that all pilots arc optimists . But we do n't anchor this time . We plod along and eventually , inch by inch , tenderly nudge into a Baltimore berth . A boom from one of our king posts picks up the gangplank and swings it out to connect ship and dock . Now the big pumps aft will take over the discharge duty when the hose connections are made . We are no longer a ship , but a tank to be emptied , and the pumpmen rise to their major duties . A visitor is aboard and the captain bids him good-by with a faint accent that might or might not go back to Saba Island . For the major part of more than four decades the captain has lived on the water . His parting words are " Happy motoring . "
