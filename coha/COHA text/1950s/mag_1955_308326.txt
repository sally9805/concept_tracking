" My life has been spent in crowds , " said Jawaharlal Nehru last month , " and I feel isolated if bodyguards come in the way between me and the people . " In the central Indian city of Nagpur last week , a man with a knife came out of a crowd , and for ten seconds there was nothing between Jawaharlal Nehru and death . <P> " I know most about the incident , " said Nehru afterwards , " because I was standing in an open car and therefore commanded a good view . At a turning , a bicycle ricksha was suddenly pushed at the car . I saw the man who pushed the ricksha coming towards the car . I was annoyed at his pushing in this manner , and thought that he probably wanted to hand me a petition . . . The man . . . proceeded on to the running board . " <P> At this point , an alert police superintendent grappled with the stranger , a wiry man in a bright green shirt and red shorts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his hand , threw him to the ground and whisked him off to the police station before the angry crowd could get at him .

We can not risk it again . "
