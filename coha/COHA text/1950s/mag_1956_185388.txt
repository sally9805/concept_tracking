Throughout the South virtually every front page last week told the news of 26-year-old Autherine Lucy 's fight to become the first Negro to enter the University of Alabama ( see EDUCATION ) . Yet , like other desegregation news that has crowded its way increasingly into the Southern press since the Supreme Court decision , it got there almost against the will of most editors . Southern newspapers - with scattered exceptions-are doing a patchy , pussyfooting job of covering the region 's biggest running story since the end of slavery . <P> The Other Side . The measure of the Southern press was taken last week by Jere Moore , editor of Georgia 's Milledgeville weekly Union Recorder , who once routed the Ku Klux Klan in a local battle . Said Moore : " The newspapers of the South have failed to take the leadership demanded of them in this issue . They have been weak-kneed when they should have been strong . We have not tackled the issue . " <P> Privately , many Southern journalists are far more enlightened than their fellow citizens on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front-office pressure and fear of community wrath . Others are too tied up in their own emotional knots to do justice to the problem . They have struck an uneasy balance between their jobs as newsmen and what they feel is their duty as Southerners . <P> Most Southern news executives have adopted a buck-passing rule of thumb : When in doubt about a racial story , use the press-association copy . For example , in the Autherine Lucy riots , papers in nearby Birmingham were the only out-of-town dailies in the South to send their own staffers to Tuscaloosa to cover the story . Sometimes papers lean on the wire services for racial news even in their own areas . When one major daily recently got tips of forthcoming antisegregation statements by religious leaders , it passed the word along quietly to a wire service instead of going after the story itself . <P> The press associations do an even-handed job of straight reporting , but in the rush to meet deadlines with fastbreaking news , they give only bits and pieces of the whole story . Inevitably , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any further effort to see the integration problem whole , so do most Southern papers . Says Editor Ralph McGill of the Atlanta Constitution , which does one of the South 's best jobs : " Most newspapers seem to have forgotten that there is another side to the story , that Texas is going ahead with integration , that Arkansas is quiet , that North Carolina is quiet , that Tennessee is quiet , that southern Missouri , which is very Southern in attitude , is going with integration . " <P> The Diehards . At its worst , notably in Mississippi , the Southern press is full of slanting , suppression and rabble-rousing against integration . The most violent is the Jackson , Miss . Daily News ( circ. 38,813 ) , whose ripsnorting old ( 78 ) Editor Fred Sullens incites readers against " mongrelization " under such front-page scare-lines as " YOU ARE FOR US OR AGAINST US . " The best that Editor Sullens could say of the Negro was in a sentimental story on the funeral of an 83-year-old onetime janitor at the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , and sang his praises as " a good Negro who knew his place . "
