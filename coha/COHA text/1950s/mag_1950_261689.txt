<P> South Amboy , N.J. ( pop . 9,500 ) , a minor port on the southern arm of vast New York Harbor , is the kind of nondescript town through which most travelers pass on the way to somewhere else . Manhattan vacationists zip past on the way to seaside villages and resorts . Commuters on the Pennsylvania 's gritty Jersey Shore line spend five minutes there every trip , buried in their newspapers or staring glumly at a shabby luncheonette across from a tavern while the electric engine is changed for a steam locomotive . Sprawled along the estuary of the Raritan River , just across the bay from the south tip of Staten Island , South Amboy exists as a kind of service entrance to the Port of New York , and it gets service-entrance traffic : coal , fertilizer from its own American Agricultural Chemical Co. ( locally known as the " Stink House " ) and recently , in increasing amounts , explosives for peace and war . <P> Last Friday night a slow , chilly drizzle was falling on South Amboy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over on the river front , a gang of longshoremen worked late . From twelve railroad cars they were unloading a deadly cargo : anti-tank and anti-personnel mines for Pakistan 's army , 2,000 cases of dynamite for blasting in Afghanistan . It was a tough but familiar job to the dockers . From the cars they moved the cases across the dock to four lighters , stowed them in neat , harmless-looking piles . When the job was done , the cargo would be ferried out to a freighter in the bay . <P> " Stalin 's Started It . " Over in town , South Amboy 's Mayor John Leonard , a short , fat man who likes to wear a baseball player 's warmup jacket , was done with his day 's work . He was watching Captain Video on his television set , had settled down for a snug evening at home . His plans were quickly changed . <P> With a thundering roar , 467 tons of explosives blew up . <P> Across South Amboy windows burst into hurling , razorlike shards . Plaster crashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lights went out . All over town , the clocks stopped at 7:26 . River mud , coal and metal fragments hurtled down from the sky . From the docks a huge mushroom cloud rose grey-white and languid . <P> Panic swept South Amboy . " Atom bomb , " someone yelled and began running . Said a townsman later : " I saw that big pile of smoke just like in the newsreels and I said : ' That bastard Stalin 's started it ! ' " Men &; women , carrying children , ran south , away from the blast . Cars loaded with frightened people sped out of town . Mayor Leonard rushed to the city hall , piled into a sound truck and rode about town bellowing reassurance . Finally , the southward rush slowed and stopped .
