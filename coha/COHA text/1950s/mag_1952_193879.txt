Behind Britain 's front against Communism in Malaya stand British colonials , whose stiff-necked disdain for Malay and Chinese alike has made the struggle harder . Last June , the Selangor branch of St. George 's Society , a British get-together club , sent out dinner invitations to the Sultan of Selangor and other Malayan dignitaries . The dinner was to take place at the exclusive Lake Club in Kuala Lumpur , but the club committee refused permission on the ground that a half-century-old custom prohibits Asian guests . The club 's action enraged Britain 's dynamic new High Commissioner Sir Gerald Templer , charged with conducting the war against the Reds . " Men who have come thousands of miles to fight Communism in Malaya , " said he , " British boys , Rhodesians , Gurkhas , Africans , Fijians , are all risking life side by side with Malay , Chinese and Indian lads . These men . . . know that the things which they are fighting for transcend the differences there may be of skin , color or custom . " <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new committee held a referendum . Last week the Lake Club 's 1,200 members decided unanimously to open the club 's doors to Asian guests .
