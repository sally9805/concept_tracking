AMERICA WILL CHANGE HER POLICY , said an eight-column head in Cairo 's official newspaper Al Gumhuria . Other Egyptian papers burbled in delight over " indications " of a Washington turnabout . The U.S. , it was reported , had resumed its Egyptian aid program , was again buying Egyptian cotton , had released $3,000,000 of Egypt 's frozen funds , had agreed to a special shipment of Salk polio vaccine-was , in short , about to go all out for Nasser . " It 's a great victory for Gamal , " said a Cairo news vendor . <P> Actually , the U.S. was doing nothing about Egypt that it had not been doing all along . The touted resumption of American aid was merely the continued honoring of commitments made before Suez . CARE negotiations remained stalled , as they had been . The U.S. has never stopped buying Egyptian cotton , or releasing in installments the frozen funds ( originally about $40 million ) , chiefly for the expenses of the Egyptian embassy in Washington and the Egyptian U.N . delegation . What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Gamal Abdel Nasser , though he had just accepted a $175 million Soviet loan , seemed not entirely satisfied with Egypt 's growing dependence on Russia and anxious to develop other friends . <P> In recent weeks Cairo has been alive with indignation over shipments of Russian wheat so rotten that it turned the bread green , of Communist Chinese tea so full of impurities that it had to be thrown away . The flood of Russian literature that pours into Egypt these days has left the average Egyptian totally unmoved ; most of it is sold by weight for wrapping papers . Cairo housewives particularly like a magazine called Russia Today for wrapping bananas . " It does n't tear so easily , " said one . Nearly every machine in Egypt is Western-made , and for lack of spare parts and the money to buy them , many are on the verge of breakdown . Spare parts are urgently needed for dredges and other equipment used to keep the Suez Canal operating . Lubricating oil is so scarce that gas-station operators supply only favorite customers . Because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter , tea and coffee are scarce . Many Cairo restaurants refuse to serve cabob because they can not sell it for a profit . " Nasser , " said one observer last week , " is facing an economic crisis that compares with the military crisis he faced last year . " <P> The U.S. was not going to be cross-ruffed into matching Russia in a bid for Nasser 's favor . But many U.S. observers concede that Nasser seems securely in power , and likely to be in power for a long time to come . To do nothing might mean to let Egypt go to Russia by default . The U.S. has always made it clear that it will release the frozen funds only when and if Nasser gives some clear and substantive evidence of good faith . The emphasis was on substantive-promises would not be enough .
