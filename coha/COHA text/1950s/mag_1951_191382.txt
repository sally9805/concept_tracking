CAUGHT ( 196 pp . ) ; CONCLUDING ( 254 pp. ) - Henry Green-Viking ( each $3 ) . <P> <P> One trouble with most contemporary novelists is that they keep putting words into the mouths of their characters . They also make them do things that seem out of character . English Author Henry Green is an exception and a rare one . Reading his best novels is like eavesdropping on his characters . They say and do the things they would if Green and his readers were n't around , but , without knowing it , they say and do them the way Green wants them to . <P> Three of Green 's novels ( Loving , Nothing , Back ) have been published in the U.S. during the last 15 months . They are books by a writer of uneven talents , but one of them , Loving ( TIME , Oct. 10 , 1949 ) , is as fresh and full of life as green grass . Both Loving and Nothing edged onto bestseller lists , and U.S. critics generally agreed that , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his best he is one of the finest writers alive . Publication of Caught and Concluding on the same day makes the point perfectly . Caught , a novel about fire fighters in London in the first years of the war , is mannered and artificial , and dull enough to have been written by a tired fireman . Concluding , a story about a government school for young girls , shows Green near his best . <P> Sherry &; Law . The school is in the country outside London , the time is in the future-some time between tomorrow and 1984-and the teen-age girls are being trained for " State Service " under socialism . The Misses Edge and Baker , who run the school , are plain and loveless . Since their authority and comfort are all they have , and all that life and their government are apt to allot them , they spend their time trying to expand the first and deepen the second . They tipple sherry and sneak smokes , their word is law , and all seems for the best in the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For one thing , two of the girls have slipped out of the dormitory and disappeared into the night . Another bothersome fact is the existence of old Mr. Rock , a distinguished scientist who lives in a cottage on the school grounds with his granddaughter Liz , a cat named Alice , a goose named Ted and a pig named Daisy . The Misses Edge and Baker want Rock off the place so they can have his cottage . A third vexation : Sebastian , one of the instructors , is making a fool of himself with the old scientist 's somewhat addle-brained granddaughter . <P> What Author Green does with these spare and seemingly trivial bits &; pieces is beyond the reach of most novelists . He has said that novels " should be concerned with the everyday mishaps of ordinary life , " and in Concluding Green gives such mishaps an atmosphere of both urgency and mystery .
