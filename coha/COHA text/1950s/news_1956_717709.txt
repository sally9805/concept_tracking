Six doctors , headed by Dr. Paul Dudley White of Boston , agreed that " medically the chances are that the President should be able to carry on an active life satisfactorily for another five to ten years . " " But the choice is his , not ours , " Dr. White emphasized . The medical report seemingly cleared the way for General Eisenhower to run again if he wished . But James C. Hagerty , White House press secretary , pointedly recalled that the final decision was one the President alone would make , probably before March 1 . He reminded reporters the . President had told his news conference last Wednesday that he would trust his own feelings more than the doctors ' reports about his physical adequacy to tackle another four-year term . Going to Georgia Today The President will fly to southern Georgia tomorrow morning , for a holiday of a week Or ten days before announcing his decision . He will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury , George M. Humphrey , near Thomasville , and may play a few holes of golf , riding in a motorized cart to conserve his strength . - The announcement by the doctors came after the New York Stock Exchange had closed . On the West Coast , however , volume spurted . Du Pont closed in San Francisco with a gain of 4 points over its New York close , Bethlehem Steel rose 2% , United States Steel 2 points and General Motors 1 Many other leading issues rose between 1 and 2 points . ) The board of six doctors reported that President Eisenhower had " made a good recovery " from his coronary thrombosis , a clot in one of the arteries leading to the heart , The President was stricken in Denver on Sept. 24 . The favorable medical verdict was not without its qualifica- tions . Dr. White said forecasts of the President 's future capabilities were offered " after weighing ' very oarefully all available evidence , including our own experience and fully aware of the hazards and uncertainties that lie ahead . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician , recalled his own estimate of last S.Ttember that the President had been in better physical condition than he had observed in ten years just before he suffered the heart attack . " We ' do n't know , " Dr. Snyder said , " that he wo n't have another cardiac accident . " One question the doctors would not answer was whether an active campaign for the Presidency might carry with it threats to the President 's future well-being , Dr. White and Dr. Snyder said this was a " political " question with which the President himself would deal when he made his own . announcement . The doctors also . declined to describe in any detail the restrictions still imposed on the President 's physical activity . Dr. White said , for example , that it was hoped that the President " eventually " would be able to resume golf on a regular basis by this spring . Dr. Snyder , at another point , said that the President would not play even a few holes of golf in Georgia if a motorized - cart were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dr. Snyder was concurred in by four other physicians , who had been associated with them in the treatment of the President . They were Col. Byron E. Pollock , chief of cardiology services at the Fitzsimons Army Hospital in Denver ; Col. Thomas W. Mattingly , chief of cardiology services at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington ; Maj. Gen. Leonard D. Heaton , commanding officer at Walter Reed , and Maj. Walter Tkach , assistant White House physician . These four joined in a written bulletin , but remained silent at a news conference that followed . The doctors met just before noon at the White House and went over for about an hour the reports of the " complete cardiovascular examination " given the President at Walter Reed last Saturday . Then Dr. White and Dr. Snyder went to the President 's living quarters in the White House ' and examined him for about an hour . The doctors lunched together , continuing their discussions , and at about 2 P. M. joined the President in his office to tell him their findings . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said . the President - would make his own , decision and announce it to the nation soon . The six doctors met the press at 3:30 P. M. in Room 474 of the old State-War-Navy building across West Executive Avenue from the White House . As the conference began , Mr. Hagerty 's assistants passed out a mimeographed 450-word statement from the doctors . Mr. Hagerty said the physicians had come , at his request , to give " a medical report , and I deliberately repeat the word ' medical . ' " " These gentlemen are doctors , " Mr. Hagerty added . " They are not politicians . " The President 's Decision He recalled the President 's last press conference in which General Eisenhower had said the decision was one for him alone to make and that he would be guided more by his own feelings than by the doctors ' report . Mr. Hagerty then asked Dr. Snyder to read the text of the medical bulletin , which began with a , report that the " President 's health continues to be satisfactory . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either weakness of the heart muscle or insufficient coronary reserve . It said the X-rays had shown " a well-healed scar " about two centimeters ( approximately eighttenths of an inch ) in diameter near the left ventricle . The X-rays of the President 's heart shadow taken last Saturday and compared with those taken over the last ten years showed no enlargement of the heart , the report continued . The bulletin said the President 's pulse and blood pressure were normal and satisfactory and that his " general circulation . including the circulation in his legs - and feet , is excellent . " Dr. Snyder said the President 's blood clotting rate was at " about the middle and upper third of the normal range . " He added that " the only drug " General Eisenhower now was receiving was an anticoagulant , and that it was expected this treatment Would continue for some time . This is a more complete report , " Dr. Snyder read , " than is usually issued under circumstances of this type . " Here he interpolated ? " I mean by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the report . " However , we make this report because the President wished that the people of this country be made acquainted with the facts as revealed by this recent examination . " When Dr. Snyder completed reading the bulletin , the first question was posed with an acknowledgment . that it had " political " aspects . It was whether in the judgment of the physicians the President 's health could withstand another four years in the White House . " We believe , " Dr. Snyder said , " that he can serve four to five years or longer in a very active position of great responsibility . " When the same question was posed to Dr. White , he said he had prepared his own summary of the medical bulletin . Dr. White said the President 's health had continued . satisfactory , that he had increased his physical activity and had resumed the full burdens of his office without " any physical difficulty . " There had been no insufficiency of coronary reserve , he continued . " Now as to the future , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fully aware of the hazards and uncertainties that lie ahead , " Dr. White added , " we believe that medically the chances are that the President should be able to carry on an active life satisfactorily for another five to ten years . " But the choice is his , not ours . " A reporter questioned Dr. White 's use of ' the phrase " the chances are " that the President should be able to carry on . " Now , you do not mean , do you , that there is any question of chance about this at all , but that actually the President should be able to ? " he asked . " That is right , " Dr White said . " But we are fully aware of the hazards and uncertainties of the days to come . That is in the statement . " The reporter persisted that it would be better to leave out the phrase . " All right , " Dr. White agreed , " because we have already said fully aware of the hazards and uncertainties that lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago he said that he would vote for the President if he decided to run again . He was asked if he still felt that way . Dr. White said he did .
