The difficulty in establishing a literary school is that someone is always cutting class . Novelist Nathalie Sarraute , dean of women of the French school known as the New Realist , inveighs against psychological novels , yet psychologizes in her own works . Her cofounder , Novelist Alain Robbe-Grillet , is an object worshiper who would rather describe a love seat than a love scene ; yet this is not consistently reflected in the novels of his disciples . They do have some common characteristics , notably a way of writing in flat tones of a world that is bleak arid joyless , where people lead lives hollow of meaning , sensing dimly-or failing to sense-that they are victims of existence . Very little happens ; predicaments are preferred to events , and orderly progression of time , clear distinction between reality and hallucination are likely to be missing . <P> None of this is dazzlingly new ; Kafka clearly is a grandfather of the movement , and Sartre and Camus are at least unacknowledged uncles . New Realism 's most important idea is to show life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present period of torpor , the Paris insurrection can not be ignored . Among the latest New Realism imports : <P> <P> JEALOUSY , by Alain Robbe-Grillet ( 149 pp. ; Grove ; clothbound , $3.50 ; paperback , $1.75 ) . The author admires cinema techniques , and his book would make an excellent art-house movie . But like his earlier work , The Voyeur ( TIME , Oct. 13 , 1958 ) , it is also thoroughly irritating . A prosaic love triangle is established on a remote banana plantation-a planter ( the book 's nameless narrator ) , his wife and a neighboring plantation owner . If this were one of Paul Bowles 's African novels of sin and sun , the weather would cloud up on cue , providing a timpani accompaniment to the heroine 's rages . Robbe-Grillet cheerfully invents a greater fault . Obsessed by the reality of objects , he describes them endlessly , and then repeats his descriptions-a column that casts a shadow , a squashed centipede , the location of a window , of a garden . In one maddening three-page section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the number of rows in each field , how many trees stand in each row . Such writing is not merely capricious ; the looming fact of the plantation 's physical existence is established-for whatever readers remain . Lost among the bananas and a time sequence that flickers eerily through past , present and future is a murder . It is dealt with in half a paragraph .
