Last night , on the major artery to the scene of the theoretical bombing , civil defense officials had set up a road block of thirty-six junk-heap cars , strewn over the road as if they had been hit by the blast . At .9:37 a city bulldozer arrived at the spot on a truck and set to work . Four minutes later Herbert Manning , operator of the giant machine , had shoved and smashed a clear path through the wreckage .
