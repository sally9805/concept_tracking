If the pampered jades of Asia had turned up in Miami Beach last week they might have melted with envy . One of the most pampered trades in the U.S.-the disk jockeys-had come to town 2,500 strong , and Big Daddy , in the shape of U.S. record companies , was there to take care of them . Officially , the jocks were attending the Second International Radio Programing Seminar and Pop Music Disk Jockey Convention . Actually , the convention was attending them . <P> When each D.J . showed up , RCA Victor handed him $1,000,000 in " play money , " but the scrip called for solid value . The D.J.s were supposed to increase their holdings by gambling and by making frequent trips to the company 's " Hospitality Suite " where they could obtain liquid refreshments plus 5,000 " dollars " for every visit . On Memorial Day , in exchange for the play money , RCA Victor auctioned off a stereo set , a color TV set , 500 real dollars worth of clothes , a trip for two to Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that time were high all right . <P> <P> " Dead Without You . " At least 50 other record companies had a finger in the gaudy handout . ABC-Paramount paid for all taxi rides . Columbia made tapes of D.J.s interviewing celebrities and gave them to the jocks to play on the air at home . There were free bus trips , promised airborne junkets to Mexico . Squads of local beach girls in Bikinis were relieved by company-strength detachments flown in from New York . A Texas firm gave away eight pairs of sunglasses with built-in transistor radios ( proud flacks claimed they cost $5,000 apiece ) . <P> Headquarters for most companies were in the Lanai suites of the Americana hotel . There the lordly jocks drifted from backslapper to backslapper , soaked up booze from novel dispensers-Panama Records had a machine with faucets for martinis and Manhattans . And everywhere a D.J . went , record company promoters kept telling him : " Without you we 're dead , boy . " <P> The promoters had other things to say when the jocks were out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're God , " said one . Explained another : " Suppose a D.J . calls New York and says he wants to see the city . What are you going to tell him-to pay for it himself ? You pay for his hotel and his meals and his liquor , and if he wants a girl you pay for that . An average New York weekend will cost the record company $500 to $1,000 , and if you do n't pay it there 's another company that will . " <P> Annual Dew . An RCA man estimated that his firm spends up to $300,000 a year on various methods of forming friendships with disk jockeys , gave an example of the effectiveness of such promotion : when a 19-year-old named Neil Sedaka cut The Diary , RCA spent $50,000 on " the full treatment , " and four weeks later the D.J.s pushed the disk into the top ten . <P> But the disk jockeys ' convention was not all payola . The sponsoring ( Omaha-based ) Storz radio chain had , after all , slipped the word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectures on such subjects as " News Should Be New , " " Do We Live and Die By Ratings ? " ( answer : yes ) , " Are Live Radio Commercials Dead ? " ( no , they just sound that way ) .
