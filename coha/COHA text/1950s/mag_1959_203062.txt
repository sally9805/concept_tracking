There is only one real issue in South African politics : the pace and vigor with which the Union 's 3,000,000 whites maintain their dominance over South Africa 's 11,000,000 blacks and coloreds . It is eleven years since the Boer Afrikaner National Party rode into power on a platform of apartheid-all-out segregation . Since then , at the cost of twisting the nation 's parliamentary and judicial traditions almost beyond recognition , and using a curious mixture of police-state methods and paternalism , the Nationalists have gone a long way toward fulfilling their segregation promises . <P> In the process they have met with little effective political opposition . Although more liberal in other matters , the largely British-backed United Party generally supports Prime Minister Verwoerd right down the apartheid line . High-minded little groups such as Novelist Alan ( Cry , the Beloved Country ) Paton 's Liberal Party have got nowhere . <P> Of late , however , moderates in both major parties have worried that the doctrinaire Verwoerd might be going too far in his economically unfeasible plan to herd Africans into eight little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paternalistic , all-white South Africa . But right-wingers in the opposition United Party , out of power since 1948 , decided to out-apartheid the Nationalists in the next elections . They rammed through the party 's convention at Bloemfontein fortnight ago a resolution against the Bantustan program-on the ground that it would reduce the size of white South Africa . Outraged , eleven liberal members of Parliament quit the United Party and announced that they would form their own Progressive Party . <P> With the liberals out , hopes ran high that the United Party would at long last be in a position to form a coalition with disgruntled Nationalist moderates led by Finance Minister Dr. Theophilus Ebenhaezer Dnges , who was thought to be fed up with Verwoerd 's rigid extremism . The hopes were short-lived . At week 's end Verwoerd and Dnges mounted the platform together to address a political rally in Worcester , Cape province . After both agreed that full apartheid is the only way for South Africa , Dnges said pointedly : " This is my answer to talk about coalition . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
