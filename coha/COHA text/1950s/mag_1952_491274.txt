NNS are called roadhouses in roadless North-ern Alaska , and there are not enough of them . Most of the Eskimo towns have no accom-modations whatever for travelers . Unalakleet is an exception . A nephew of the white trader once thought he would like to live there and built him-self an apartment out of the end of the stockroom . Now empty , the rooms may be rented . Each con-tains a bed , no other furniture , and when the wind blows up through the cracks in the floor , it lifts the linoleum as much as a foot . But technically a travel guide could list for Unalakleet , " Hotels : 1 . " The trader , who dominated the town for about forty years , died recently . When I came , he was still alive and operating his post . His younger Es-kimo wife was away on a week-long berrying expedi-tion , and the trader , eighty-four years old , was keep-ing things going . He was more than half sick with neuralgia and other ills , but he insisted on doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clad in a bathrobe over pajamas. and a fur cap , and with eyes watering with pain , he would drag his slippers from cupboard to stove . When the meal was ready , then , there would be mushrooms in the gravy and a sauce for the fish ? delicious as food is only when the cook is by nature an epicure . The family included an Eskimo boy of four , who had been left at home . He had been taught to say grace , in his own words , which changed from meal to meal , but usually ended , " And help ev'body to be nice . " I think that our amiability was always raised a notch by the little prayer , but not to the point where the trader wanted to talk . As we ate , the bleakly silent old man , the shy child and I , each was listening to his own thoughts , the roar of the cookstove , and the Bering Sea gale whirling the wind battery charger on the roof . I had arrived at the height of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dory from our small ship had found its way through the mouth of the river , where the Coast Guard provides a beach light , and into the slough behind town . Shore and water were uniformly dark , but the men turned the boat to the left till it ran aground . We debarked and began the search for the trading post , groping along muddy paths and through dripping marsh grass with the black wind snapping our raincoats . Log cabins loomed here and there . Each time we came near PHOTOGRAPHY BY GEORGE BURNS one , six to a dozen dogs stirred and growled . Then finally we saw the higher bulk of a group of two-story buildings  --  the school , mission orphanage , trading post and native store . Whether Unalakleet is approached by sea or by air , these buildings surmount the others and locate the heart of the town . The schoolhouse stands in the intersection of the two principal lanes , with the playground on all sides of it , a kind of town square . On the seaward side of the square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orphanage . On the landward side , extending from the school grounds to the slough , is the trading post . It is a log structure , about thirty by a hundred and twenty feet , covered with corrugated iron once painted light green . We entered it through the porch , as it is called in the north , an unheated room where fur garments , the dog sled and other winter gear are kept , and where the wind is trapped before the door is opened into the warm interior . The Unalakleet trading post has been up a long time , it is settling as log buildings do , and the night I came it looked very old , with the smoke-blackened timbers absorbing most of the light from the kerosene lamp at the rear . That room is the store . The living quarters are upstairs , and I waited below , watching the Eskimo postmaster sort out the mail pouches to go on the boat , while the captain woke up the trader . Most of ( Continued ed on ' age 42 ) UNALAKLEET @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen was strange to a Stateside traveler  --  the fur parkas suspended from nails in the rafters , the traps and the dog chains and harnesses hanging on walls and beams . In the center of the room was a great cast-iron stove with a fire smoldering in it . But what gave the place character was the smell  --  the combined smells of hides , the differing musky scents of mink , marten , beaver and other pelts , of sealskins and dried fish , rope , sawdust , new cotton cloth , stored potatoes and onions and , pervading all , the pungent odor of seal oil , which some strangers find distasteful when they first come in contact with Eskimos , but which ? them- like . It is a healthy odor , with a tang to it , and unless many people are crowded into a warm room , it is , to my notion , pleasant . Unalakleet ? pronounced You-na-lakleet ? has a population of 550 , not counting the river ghost. , the black ghost , with green eyes that comes in off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live back in the trees . In the village itself the only whites are the trader , the missionaries and teachers , but at opposite ends of the town are two foreign colonies  --  the personnel at the airfield and . a few Lapp families , descendants of herde7 brought in to teach the natives hosf to take care of imported reindeer . Both of these groups keep pretty much to themselves . The town is located at the inner bend of Norton Sound , an arm of the Bering Sea , and is a kind of distributing point for twenty or more smaller settlements . A plane flying from Anchorage to Nome stops every day with the mail . In the summer , at least one ship from Seattle anchors offshore long enough for the trader 's barge to lighter in Stateside freight , and during those months the little coastwise freighter on which I arrived comes past every two or three weeks . Any time from September on , ice will close the sea . Until June , then , all supplies come by air , for there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post is more than a setting for business deals ; it is a kind of men 's club , as I learned during the first few days , while the storm kept me inside . There was never a time ? in any weather  --  when more than a dozen Eskimo men were not there , sitting on the counter or the floor . They have the inscrutable eyes of the Orientals , eyes always thoughtful in even the merriest face . Coming into their gaze , I acquired then , during the first week , the feeling I always have , that Eskimos understand white people better than we do them . Women came to the store , and when they had made their purchases , left , but the men would be there all day . Unless there is immediate need for food , water or firewood , it is quite possible that an Eskimo would feel guilty to rush around when he could be quiet . The old trader had acquired something of their philosophy . He would no doubt have preferred to have the men out catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would come downstairs , to sit in the postmaster 's cubbyhole and go over his mail , he would talk to the natives as if he liked to see the row of dark-ruddy faces , looking so much at peace . Now the post is run by the executor of his estate , a man who is kind and intelligent , but , being new to the north , he tries to persuade the natives to keep further ahead with their supplies and not " waste " so much time . Perhaps he does not yet realize that an Eskimo 's living is secured by bursts of intense and prolonged effort when the fish are running , or the weather is right for sealing , or it is time to visit the trap line . Nature 's rhythm , not clocks or calendars , must regulate his days , and for the periods of extreme exertion there must be periods of resting and storing up strength . Anyway , the natives continue to sit in the store . At Unalakleet , as everywhere , they refuse to adopt the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eskimos ' own criticism of white people  --  almost the only criticism they ever voice  --  is , " There is no such hurry . " They do not quite face the fact that most civilized goods , which they want , are produced by people in a hurry . Those who are made uncomfortable by the new trader 's lecturing spend their days in the native store . The native store is a co-operative , one of about thirty in Alaska . They are run by Eskimo managers , but have a buying organization in Seattle , headed by white men . The association was organized in 1946 by two employees of the Alaska Native Service , a branch of the Bureau of Indian Affairs . Through the ANS , Government loans were secured for the stores ; therefore the ANS supervises the store operations , with the ANS schoolteachers passing on even minor decisions . Like most of the stores , the one at Unalakleet does only fairly well . The Eskimos have not had much merchandising experience , but most teachers have not had , either , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stymied action because of ill feeling . Nick Riley , the Eskimo manager , said to one of the traveling supervisors , " You do n't listen to us , you just tell us , so you do n't ever know how things really are . " That criticism could be applied to other white officials in authority over Eskimos . But Nick , at least , created just the right atmosphere for a native to sit and grow wise . Except that the stock is smaller , the native store looks much like the white trader 's ? no show windows , just a big , dark room with a stove in the center and counters and shelves at the sides . Whereas the trading post offers civilized products mostly , the native store also deals in native supplies  --  seal oil , sinew , fresh fish from upriver , and the natives ' handwork such as boots , mukluks . These stores are the modern counterpart , of the kashint , the building which was , for immemorial ages , the men 's living quarters . Until the missionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men usually slept in the kashim , and their wives brought their meals to them there . That system had one disadvantage  --  all the town 's man power , its hunters , was concentrated in one room where it could be wiped out by an attacking enemy . The history of Unalakleet involves a long harassment by a tribe farther south , the Magemuts . Their method was to approach at night , block the entrance of the kashint and shoot the men through the smoke hole in the roof with their bows and arrows . The town of Unalakleet was something like the capital of the region occupied by the Unalit tribe . The area of the Unalits extended from below St. Michael to above Shaktoolik , about 150 miles of the coastline . The Magemuts no longer bother the people of Unalakleet , but the Indians do . The Yukon River is about ninety miles inland from Unalakleet , and traditionally that river region belongs to the Indians . The border between the two LIQUID territories is not shown on any map , but it is well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come over onto our land , we will kill them , " one of the men at Unalakleet told me complacently . He related how one of his neighbors was hunting near Shaktoolik a few years before . " He look around , he see an Indian crawlin ' on him , so he walk back to where he can get the Indian between him and the setting sun . When the Indian come across that red ball , he shoot him . " The tale may have been nothing but big talk ; nevertheless it revealed an attitude . The Unalit word for " Indian " is " inkilik , " meaning a louse egg . The Unalits have always been known as one of the best-natured tribes of Eskimos . They are so peaceful by temperament that the belligerent Male-mute , the Eskimos to the north , used to tell travelers the Unalits were " easy , like children . " Because of the Unalits ' reputation for friendliness , many natives from other tribes who were dissatisfied in their own settlements have moved to Unalakleet . So many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its dialect now a mixture from north and south . Since it is one of the cleanest and most prosperous of all the native towns in Alaska , the newcomers must have been t tie more enterprising ones of their tribes , rather than outcasts . But a few had been troublemakers . Unalakleet had an especially bad experience with one , an aggressive fellow named Agunapaiak , who moved there during the 1870 's from the Seward Peninsula . He came because he had killed a man and feared revenge at home , and events proved that at heart he was a murderer . Being smart as well as a bully , however , he soon had made himself the head man of his adopted people . One day , when he was ready to start to St. Michael in his umiak , one of his oarsmen failed him , and in anger he seized a woman on the beach and put her into the boat to help row . Her husband , a cripple who particularly needed her help , came hurrying down to protest . Agunapaiak killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the trip , pulling an oar all the way . A member of his own family did away with the wicked chief . Agunapaiak had told someone that he was going to kill his brother-in-law because he had refused to help murder some men for their furs . The brother-in-law heard of the threat and struck down Agunapaiak and his son with an ax while they slept . Everyone was relieved , yet the tradition of blood revenge was so strong at that time that the brother-in-law lived out all his remaining days in fear . The Eskimos used to say that they could tell a man who had killed someone by his restless eyes , because always thereafter he must he on watch for a relative of the dead man . Unalakleet is now governed by an elected council of five Eskimo men . The president of the council functions somewhat as the old headman did . An Eskimo chief generally gained his position by superiority of skill and intelli gence  --  his Unalit title was anaiyukok , " the one to whom everyone listens " and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprimand culprits . Often he only required that they apologize . Among a people as proud as the Eskimos , such a humiliation was usually enough punishment . The same reliance on public approval can be seen in the way the affairs of the town are run now . While I was there , the missionary inadvertently stacked firewood across the lane on which the dog teams are driven out to the beach . The council sent word that they wished to see him . They told him he had one week to move the logs . " What if I do n't ? " he asked . " Then we will fine you , " said the president , Fred Katchatag . " I do not say it will be a big fine . It will be only a small fine . But you will move the logs . We give you one week . " The missionary moved them . I heard from one of the Eskimos how this missionary , when he first came , asked to see a copy of the village laws . " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' That is no way to run a town . You must write your laws in a book . ' That was foolish , " continued the native , " because everybody knows what is right and wrong . " But everybody does not know , or perhaps does not care , for in Unalakleet , as elsewhere in Alaska , the natives sometimes have trouble with the kind of white men who come to their village . In few civilized towns does anyone have as much power as the trader , teacher and missionary in an Eskimo settlement . These three often struggle among themselves for domination over the natives , using methods that would not be tolerated in most of the States . The more isolated the villages , the more bitter , it seems , are the quarrels . The old trader in Unalakleet was more considerate than those in some towns . He always gave help to a family in an emergency ; one winter during an epidemic he fed most of the village , and he was in no sense a despot . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Rev. A. E. Karlson and his wife took several native children into their home and reared them . Mrs. Oliver Anawrok was one , and she tells how Mrs. Karl-son would sit and sew with tears blurring the stitches . " She never complain , but she was so lonely . She never see white women , only miners coming through Unalakleet from Yukon to Nome . " Some of the teachers are remembered with much affection  --  Emil Fisher and Bessie Smith particularly . But the relationship between the Unalakleet Eskimos and the teachers and missionaries has not always been happy . The natives do not know , in such eases , just what are their rights . The council would like to have some authority over the white residents , but its jurisdiction is not well defined . The last native chief died in 1942 . He must have been a man of impressive personality , for he is still talked about , even by young people who were children when he was alive . Being a shaman  --  a witch doctor  --  he not only administered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost articles with his magic , and foretold the future . When he was old , he became a Christian . I heard several times about the night that he was baptized  --  how the church building suddenly rose from its foundations about eighteen inches . The chief 's name was Nashoalook . As a young man he had two wives , a ( Galli Tined on Page 45 ) ( Cont. e41 from Page 43 ) situation that grieved the first missionary , the Reverend Mr. Karison . Although Nashoalook himself was not accepting the Christian faith at that time , he finally gave in to the missionary 's urging and sent away one of his wives . Nashoalook had four children , two by the wife who left and two by the one who stayed . His qualities of intelligence and leadership were transmitted to all of them . The older daughter , Mrs. Miles Gounangn , a puckish woman and now a great-grandmother , is one of the three village midwives . The older son , Joseph , became a schoolteacher and later a labor leader who spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the other son , is the father of ten and is secretary of the village council and of the native store . The younger daughter , Lillian , is married to Harold Ivanoff , an airport mechanic of Eskimo and Russian ancestry ; several village families have Russian names , since Unalakleet was a Russian trading post before 1867 , when the United States purchased Alaska . Lillian has gone as far as anyone in the town in adopting civilized ways . She is slim and chic , flies to Anchorage once a year for a permanent wave , and is the only village woman who has running water in her house . She could be taken anywhere for a kasak , a white person . Kasak is a word that the Unalakleet Eskimos have adopted from " Cossacks , " the first white men that they saw . Lillian has her kasak kind of prestige , but it is no greater than that of the women who excel by Eskimo standards . Much respect is given to Mrs. Anawrok , skillful at skin sewing and preparing smoked-salmon strips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mrs. Isaiah Towarak , a leader in the church ; to Mrs. Thelma Lockwood , who , without children of her own , has raised several orphans ; to Mrs. Frank Ryan , who inherited the reindeer herd of her grandmother , the famed Sinuk Mary ; to Mrs. Thora Katchatag , midwife at more than 100 births without a fatality ; and to three handsome sisters , Mrs. Sam Otton , Mrs. John Auliye and Mrs. Frank Degnan , and others . Among the men , Stefan Ivanoff has a unique position because he is the United States commissioner . The year I was there , he caught nine of the season 's forty white whales , and he is unusual in that he has success in capturing all kinds of animals , whereas most of the hunters are specialists . Eric Accibuck , for example , is fascinated by bears . He has killed many , but essentially he is an ivory carver , one for whom " the sun shines on both sides of the fence , " as another Eskimo characterized a happy-go-lucky artistic temperament . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team like David Paniptchuck 's thirteen white Huskies . For sheer daring , no hunter excels Henry Nashoalook and the friend with whom he often goes out on the ice , Franklin Soxie . They go farther from shore , and stay longer , in stormier weather than most of the other men . One day they were stalking seals on the edge of the shore-fast ice when a sudden blizzard enveloped them . As they were packing their gear to come home , the wind broke off the edge of the ice and they found themselves being blown out to sea with their dogs and their single-man kayak . Henry put the dogs in the small boat and paddled them back to the shore-fast ice . By the time he returned for his companion , Franklin had disappeared . Henry searched through the blowing snow for several hours , while the floe drifted farther . Finally he found Franklin asleep in a sheltered nook between upended cakes . The two men , crowded into the boat 's one opening , made their way with great difficulty through the turbulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the village hunters became lost in the mountains . The country behind Unalakleet is a confusing conglomeration of peaks , and the hunter wandered so far that he was bewildered by a strange landscape . He was gone for some time . When he returned , we asked him how he had found his way back . " A small bird guide me , " he said . " It always keep flying in front of me . Finally I see it want me to follow , and it lead me to a place on the river I know . " That adventure was more interesting than hazardous , but far too many of the hunting expeditions do end tragically . There are but two or three men in the village who have survived to old age , whereas an ancient grandmother seems to be found in a corner of every cabin . Incidentally , there is a great misconception about the Eskimos ' " putting their old folks out on the ice to die . " There may be authentic records of such incidents , long ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the thought , although they said that old people who felt themselves to be a burden sometimes have had to be persuaded not to end their own lives . The Government 's old-age pensions are making any such sacrifice unnecessary . This source of cash money , as well as the aid to dependent children , is hastening the transition between the hunting-and-fishing economy of the natives and the wage-earning economy of the white man . It is hard to imagine that the transition will ever become complete , for who will pay wages , in amounts sufficient to support a family , to an Eskimo working in his small Arctic town ? Most of the village men are taken by plane to one of the Bristol Bay fish canneries for a month every summer . For that employment they are guaranteed about $525 each , and it is the only money that most of them see in a year . They sell furs to the stores , but usually receive credit for those , or more often the value of the furs i24 applied on past debts . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their summer days to the white man for that is the time when the fish are running , and about 5000 fish a year are needed to feed a family , including its dogs . Some of the kasak goods seem essential now  --  flour , sugar , coffee and canned milk ; an outboard motor and gasoline ; guns and ammunition . Some furnishings for the cabins , too , have become almost necessities  --  a stove , table , chairs , in some cases a sewing machine , and a radio , which is mostly a prestige item , since the reception is terrible . The wife of one industrious Eskimo even has a piano . It is to buy such things that the men go to the cannery , although the best of the hunters can trap enough furs to provide them . As the natives see more white people and more of their magazines , whose pictures make civilized merchandise look so tempting , what will be the effect ? The Eskimos can , of course , migrate to the white man 's cities . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those have returned . One girl spent a summer traveling in the States with a kasak family and did not like it . " The cities were exciting at first , " she said , " but after a while they just seemed too busy . " By the end of that fall storm , the town and surrounding landscape , explored only from windows , had become tantalizing . The scene is enclosed by a mountain range which swings back from the shore in the shape of a warrior 's bow . The beach is the string , and the space between bow and string is a watery marsh . Lay an arrow upon the bow  --  it is the Unalakleet River  --  and where it crosses the string , there , at 46 TIDE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 19 , 1952 one side of the river 's mouth , is the village . One irregular row of cabins stretches along the sea beach and another along the slough , with a few in the center beside the lane that extends from the river back to the airstrip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabins are made of spruce logs , weathered to silver . Garden plots enclose all of them . Since the sea and the slough temper the cold in the soil , vegetables can be grown , and due to the zeal of the first missionaries , all the natives are gardeners . Each homestead includes a cache  --  a log shed raised on poles to keep food supplies away from clogs and wolves  --  and a high rack on which fish and meat are dried . Up on the rack , sealskins are spread to the wind . When the sun is behind the parchmentlike skins stretched on oval frames , they look like big yellow lanterns . That important vehicle , the skin boat , the kayak , also is laid on the rack . if left on the ground , dogs would eat the oogrookbearded seal  --  hide of which it is made . Some families , finally , have sod-covered caves to store river ice . In Alaska , ice igloos are used only by one nomad tribe , who need temporary shelters as they follow the migrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eskimos make their homes of whatever materials their part of the country provides  --  logs , rocks , walrus skins , driftwood , whale bones and sod , and now of some State-side materials . No others are more snug than the cabins of Unalakleet , each in its neatly cultivated , fenced garden , with the picturesque cache , rack , ice cave and team of dogs chained to separate stakes  --  a pleasing sight , even beautiful , because these homes are so right for the country . Functionalism is not a style in Alaska ; it is a way to survive . When the storm finally blew away , the deserted town suddenly bloomed like a festival . Early , the first fine morning , the natives were out on the lanes and both beaches , and the delight with which they returned to the out-of-doors was a wonderful thing to share . In any weather the Arctic air has an elixir , perhaps due to its cleanness , perhaps to the shallowness of the troposphere  --  only about half as thick as it is at the equator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here near the Pole . One 's spirits are unaccountably high . On a sunny day the sky is so filled with shine that it seems like a soap bubble , you inside  --  you could float up if you wished , you are that weightless . The Eskimos felt the buoyancy , I thought , as a boatman brought in his dory . He beached the prow and came ashore by running along the edge of one side . A girl was jumping on one end of a teeter-totter , airy as a fly , while her friends tried to bounce her off . The younger girls sat on the sand and juggled small stones with almost professional skill . Boys jumped off the bank at the top of the beach and , all wearing boots , ran in and out of the water . Across the slough , in the marsh , men moved through the long grass with their guns , for the ducks , geese and cranes were migrating south and often stopped here to feed . Boats were skimming around on the slough and the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives are always on watch for game , and they can see farther , up on their feet . A boat came with a load of dried fish , caught at the owner 's camp up the river . All the families have fish camps , where they stay for the summer months . One man was going out to his gill net , he said  --  a net stretched from the shore into the sea . He hoped to find flounders and silver salmon in it . Boats with women and children were departing for the riverside meadows , where the families would gather wild berries and herbs to be put down in seal oil for the winter . Two of the boats carried tubs for fresh water , and one arrived back with firewood . A knot of women and girls , bright as flowers in their percale parka covers , drew me farther along the beach . With welcoming smiles they made a space in their circle , which surrounded a satin-white whale , just brought in from an offshore net by Stefan Ivanoff and two nephews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would furnish a wealth of meat in its twelve-foot length . In the watching eyes there was more than interest  --  there was a sense of security felt for the hunter 's family . The nephews were doing the butchering . Kermit 's long knife slit the belly from chin to tail , as easily as it would go through silk . Sliding under the skin then , in crescent-shaped cuts , it freed the whale 's coat , the muktuie , from the layer of blubber beneath . After the skin was peeled back , t he blubber was sliced in the same way from t he nearly black flesh . And all this was done very neatly , at the foot of the beach , on a square of corrugated iron , so that escaped blood ran down the grooves into the water . The skin was cut into slabs and the flesh into strips , and Stefan carted them in a wheelbarrow to his drying rack , w here his wife was hanging them over the poles . The watchers seemed to enjoy Kermit 's practiced use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat that kept filling the wheelbarrow . Everything that was being done  --  the handling of the boats , the quieting of the babies , even the children 's play  --  had a skillfulness , a creative touch , that was fascinating to see . And for every worker there seemed to be one looking on  --  pleasant for both . Near Stefan 's whale was the mound of net in which it had been snared . Other boys watched as his grandson , Leonard , straightened it out . First he loosened the meshes , then worked open the tangles and laid the net at its full length on the sand-100 feet long , it was . ? Like a dry-goods salesman measuring cloth , Leonard folded it up and with another boy 's help carried it to the cache , where he hooked it onto the rack , draping it down in the sun . If a net is not brought in often and dried , it rots , he said . A neighbor was scraping the whale 's five-foot stomach , which was hung , like a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat and flesh with an ulu , a knife like a chopping knife , with an ivory handle . I longed to try what she was doing , although I was sure that I would have cut into the membrane . When she was through , she inserted a stovepipe into the opening to stretch it . Later the dried muktule would be stored in the membrane hag , Stefan told me . Into his boat he had put another net , with its weights made of grooved stones , and its floats of driftwood knots , charred so they could better be found on the shine of the sea . Stefan was going out again , to set this new net in " his place " ? his part of the ocean , reckoned from a certain creek emptying out from the shore . Before he left , coming down through the beach grass , he turned at the top of the bank and looked hack at the meals that his net had provided . I t wasa good life , whatever its hardships , that made a man hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way Stefan did . Almost all the work being performed that day would have been classed as sport by any kasak vacationing in a Stateside summer resort . Yet those refreshing activities were actually an economic system  --  one in which no man took orders from anyone else , or measured his labor by clocks , or lifted a little harder to please a foreman , or held back his output to please a union agen4 There were no customers to he won and no high-pressuring to resist  --  m pay checks , but no bills either . No official was there with the watchers , no one feared any man . This was living close to the land , as Thoreau might have approved , a Bering Sea Walden , where nature furnished the food , and with it Thoreau 's " tonic of wildness . " Not all Eskimo towns are situated so favorably . Unalakleet has everything ? mountains for trapping , trees for timber , tundra for berries , a river for fish and fresh water , and a pocket of shore line into which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The currents that wash in here to the head of the sound carry hordes of the almost invisible life of the plankton . The small fish follow to feed on it , larger fish trail the smaller ones , and the seals and whales come to capture the biggest . Season by season the great harvests arrive . As the early spring storms break up the offshore ice , the seals bask on the floes , and the men in their kayaks hunt them . By April the south-facing hillsides begin to thaw , the squirrels leave their holes and the people of Unalakleet empty out into squirrel camps . In early June the sea fairly churns with herring and smelts ; later that monl h arrive the enormous king salmon , seeking the river to spawn , and after them , silver salmon . By that time the white whales are here , and seals are still caught . Berries are found from August until the snow covers them ? blueberries , cloudberries , wild cranberries  --  an important part of the Eskimos ' diet . Each family gathers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trapping begins , with mouthwatering roasts of ptarmigan , bear meat , sometimes moose and caribou , and always wild hare and trout .

These are signs , and perhaps the footsteps beat in one 's blood . The Eskimos greet the change joyfully . They are thrilled by the coming of spring , but many told me , " We like winter better . " Frequent blizzards may be uncomfortable  --  they do , however , furnish excitement , and such basic happenings are in some mysterious way satisfying . The storms , the northern lights , the births , deaths , the lovemaking , the darling play of the unspoiled Eskimo children , the building of sleds , the carving of wooden utensils , the hunt , the good meal , the relaxed sleep after exertion  --  these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
