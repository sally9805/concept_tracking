Tale for a Deaf Ear A Story by Elizabeth Enright Drawings by Lillian Freedgood I T is fashionable in this cold day when the impossible is repeatedly achieved to laugh at the existence of miracles . They say that what has happened is in reality only a change of concept , science having replaced the idea of magic or prayer as a means of wresting marvels from the universe . Yet miracles do occur or , to be more accurate , they begin to occur , but because of the present inability of human thought to accept them they are never brought to consummation . Never , as usual , is to say almost never : there is always the rule 's exception . Last year , for instance , a miracle happened to a woman named Laura Redaw Gates on January 26 , a Sunday , in Connecticut not far from Danbury . This Sunday had been much like many another in the mutual life of Laura and her husband , Tracy Benson Gates . They were a childless couple , neither old nor young , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-to-do and lived in a large white house on a large lonely piece of property outside the town . They had risen late , looked at the papers , eaten dinner ; their Finnish couple , Aarvo and Fania , had been allowed to take the car and go to the movies as usual on Sundays , and a heavy cloudbank of boredom shot through with flashes of antagonism was building up within the house . Tracy had had his uneaseful nap and was now resentfully recovering from it . Laura was finishing the last of the newspaper . Every Sunday she was bullied by its pages , forced to read it all , section by section , dizzied with words about Saudi Arabia , Moscow , Easthampton , narcissus bulbs , mulch , loam , racetracks , funerals , novels , Republicans and Democrats . Her eyes ached , her elbows itched , and she felt harried and driven , tormented by information . A neglected voice had been speaking from the radio for a long time . Out-of-doors more snow was falling ; the landscape was all white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ femme . In the old days Tracy and Laura might have used up the afternoon with love-making , or walking in the snowy woods , or listening to music ; but they had long ago forgotten or abandoned such pastimes in favor of quarrels . T ODAY it began when Tracy went to the liquor tray and mixed himself a drink . Laura who was feverishly hastening through the poetry column in Section Two saw him above the newspaper . She tried to concentrate on a cottage-poem about honeyed paneling and old elm twigs but it was no use : Tracy clinked and clinked . She watched him covertly . She spoke . " Already ? " she said . His back took on a silence ; he held the ice tongs poised above his glass . She was glad to see him angry . " Already ? " he said . " Already what ? " " Last Sunday you began at four o'clock . Today you begin at three forty-five . " In virtuous and maddening corroboration the tall hall-clock struck the quarter hour . " Accurate time sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down in his chair , holding his glass up to the light and gazing through its yellow depths . " Next Sunday I 'm going to begin before dinner and the Sunday after that before breakfast . And what about it , anyway ? " " Nothing at all about it , " said Laura , laughing angrily . " I 've just been reading an article about alcoholism , that 's all . " She rattled the paper and stared fixedly at a photograph of something or other . " Better watch it a little , that 's all . " " I 'd better watch it ! Listen , who 's got the background for it , you or me ? Do n't let 's forget about your old man ? " " My father ! " cried Laura . " Not my old man , my father . Do n't you dare call him my old man . And he was a fine person , too , well liked by everyone and well known in his profession ? " MAGAZINE " Well known as a West Hartford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loud gasp Laura threw down the paper and marshaled all her energies for battle . Tracy met her more than halfway . Their voices rose and in their angry words loud doors were slammed and other secret doors were flung open , wrenched open , letting in the brutal light . Nothing was left uninvaded . Tracy was sensitive about his weight and Laura about her age . Laura was guarded about her background and Tracy about his college record ; all these and many other sore vanities were torn from their sheltered places and strewn about the room . Some people quarrel somberly . They are rational and quiet and their rage is courteously delivered so that it does not seem like a quarrel at all . It is formal and stately like a pavan danced by icy partners . Tracy and Laura never went in for that . Their quarrels were tarantellas , hot , hasty , and frantic ; and today like the tarantella of myth , death was all that caused it to cease . Tracy dropped dead . There he had been at one moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearty with anger , mouth open shouting , arm raised in a gesture that could become a blow ; and then a look had come into his face as though he saw something beyond her , or heard something , that instantly changed the direction of his thought , and he had let his arm fall at his side , then he himself had fallen , still with that look on his face , dead as a stone at her feet . Laura stood gaping at him . All her own ' anger which had been gathering to a lofty crest was turned back upon her and her first feeling was one of frustration . Then she was shaken by panic . She dropped down beside him and tried to find his pulse , but her fingers trembled too much , and she leaned her ear against his silent chest . There was no doubt that he was dead , but she sprang up and ran to the telephone : if he was only this minute dead , so near to life still , the doctor would , must , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when she got his office the civil emotionless voice said : " Doctor 's on his way to a call in Danbury . " " Get him , then ! " cried Laura . " My husband 's dead or dying . Get him fast ! " Then she went back to Tracy and , though it made no sense , put a blanket over his legs and a pillow under his head ; and it was then that she was drowned in remorse . " Oh give him back to me ! " cried Laura , on her knees . " It will all be different , all be different ! I will never say another angry word or quarrel again . I will cherish and appreciate  --  oh , give him back ! " N ow it happened that she said these words in a spirit of true penitence at twenty-seven and one-half minutes after four o'clock on the afternoon of January the twenty-sixth , the anniversary of the death of Saint Hyppraxias the Mariner , who had always had a fondness for penitents having himself reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had been one of his rewards in heaven to be allowed to make the following arrangements : that if on the anniversary  --  to the very hour and second  --  of his own death a true penitent should plead sincerely for the return of his dead , the plea would be granted . So far this had happened three times only : once in the province of Tuscany and twice in the Hebrides , and all in distant and more credulous eras . This was the first time that the saint 's celestial machinery had ground out a modern tune . T RACY sighed , opened his eyes , and glared at Laura . " For God 's sake what are you doing down on your knees like that ? " he said . " Why are you crying ? Why am I on the floor ? " " Oh , Tracy darling ! " cried Laura beside herself . " Oh , darling get up , no , lie down . No , get up and lie down . On the couch , I mean . Tracy , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I prayed and they gave you back to me ! " " Are you insane ? " said Tracy , getting to his feet and pushing away her helping hand . " I just blacked out for a second ; done it before . Indigestion . Prayers ! Miracles ! Are you out of your head ? " His snatch of heaven had not changed his mood , evidently . He reached for his glass . " No , dear Tracy , no more , " said Laura . " Let me make you a cup of tea instead , or some hot milk . " " Have I ever been known to touch either ? I am not sick and I will not drink slops , " cried Tracy . " What 's wrong with you ? You seem to be impersonating somebody 's gentle old grandmother for some reason . Nothing 's the matter with me but indigestion , maybe blood pressure . I 'll have the doctor check it in a day or two . " Laura turned away and looked out at the snowy meadows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . It was a miracle . But a tiny doubt annoyed her . However she would not listen to it . She turned back to him impulsively . " Let me help you up to bed . You should get off your feet , do n't you think so ? And have a nice rest ? " " A gentle old grandmother , " Tracy repeated in mock wonder . " Or is it a psychiatric nurse you make me think of ? " " What an old bear we are , " said Laura , who had never used the plural pronoun in this fashion before , and laughing also in a new way . " A psychiatric nurse it is , " Tracy decided . " Oh come along , Tracy , come with me , " coaxed Laura , putting her arm around his shoulder , which immediately winced away . " For God 's sake stop fingering me ! " He looked at her so directly , with all the withering opinion of this moment so ruthlessly revealed that she moved away , sat down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take hold of something . Well , maybe he had only blacked out , fainted for a second . People did , sometimes , and certainly he looked no different . She had been hysterical . It was not possible that death had cooled that florid face even for an instant or smoothed away that look of sturdy displeasure , so alive , so known to her . She did not know what to think or how to feel , but when he went to the liquor tray to refill his glass she said , " Oh Tracy , not again ! I 'm afraid of what will happen ? " " I can handle it , " he said . " Have n't I made that clear ? Not everybody can , you know . Remember fhe time I found your old man , blind , asleep in the lap of the General Grant statue after the Furnacemen 's convention ? " " General Sherman , " corrected Laura , her voice trembling . " The Heating and Air-Conditioning convention . Tired , not blind ! " " And may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your aunt 's second wedding ? " said Tracy , ignoring the corrections , and beginning to laugh . " Oh , leave Father out of it ! cried Laura , with a last lurch at peace . " How can I forget him ? " gasped Tracy , choking with laughter as he watched her . " Your old man  --  your old man  --  of all the dressy old turkey gobblers ! Of all the silver-plated , aerated old poltroons ! " Laura threw down the paper for the last time . " Very well , " she cried , eager to make up for lost time . " Very well ! I have been forbearing , heaven knows . I have tried ; I will try no longer . Now then , Tracy Benson Gates , in the first place I want you to know ? " The tarantella was resumed ; the voices rose , snapping like flames in a dry thicket , impetuous and free and greedy . Wilder and wilder burned the anger until it had reached such a point that Tracy put down his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mouth open shouting , arm raised in a gesture that could become a blow . . .. And in that instant Laura knew clearly and perfectly what would happen next . W HEN Dr. Pulver arrived he found Tracy Gates just as dead as he had expected . Coronary thrombosis , as he had suspected , too . The attitude of the widow surprised him , however . She seemed more puzzled than grief-stricken , also she laughed from time to time . Not heartily , of course , just one short monosyllable of a laugh ; still it . vas unusual and rather disturbing . Dr. Pulver did not like to have his smooth professional sympathy ignored in such a brusque and irresponsible manner . A manifestation of hysteria , he supposed , and gave her a quieting injection , and in a little while she was able to stop that queer intermittent laugh , though she made one rather odd remark , he thought . " Lots of people suspect it , " she said , looking him straight in the eye . " Through all the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to be the one to prove it ? What cosmic circumstance makes me the guinea pig ? " But that was the only thing she said that could be called irrational , and after a while , when she seemed fairly composed , Dr. Pulver telephoned her sister in Hartford and told her she had better come and stay in the house with Laura at least until after the funeral .
