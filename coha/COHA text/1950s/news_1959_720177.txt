txt ANCHORAGE , Alaska , Jan. 15 ? Alaskans are preparing to savor the first fruits of statehood . With their minds on the cost of living , taxation , new capital and resource development , they are awaiting eagerly but with some uneasiness the opening session of the fortyninth state 's first Legislature . What the legislators do in Juneau , starting on Jan. 26 , will have a direct bearing on the beginning Alaska makes as a state in virtually every field . It will also affect the pocketbooks and peace of mind of every resident . The sixty members of the State Senate and House of Representatives will tackle a proposed revision of the whole executive department of Government , perhaps leading to administrative changes in education , health , " welfare and other areas . They must set up a new judicial system , attract investment capital and provide new bases of taxation , Thousands of inquiries pouring in to Alaska 's governmental and private agencies presage a sharp growth in the tourist industry , A big jump in the present modest population , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first decade of statehood . What is it like to live in Alaska at the dawn of this era ? Through the stories told by residents runs the refrain of the pioneer  --  life is often lonely and not infrequently studded with economic setbacks . In most cases , however , the re // MANY PROBLEMS FACE LEGISLATORS But NewState 's Citizens See Vast Potential in Future ? Shrug Off Reverses // wards of forging a future in this infant state appear to more than offset the hardships and heartbreaks . The following sketches were gathered on a tour of Alaska. , They explore the lives of four typical residents : Anchorage Merchant Bennie Leonard runs a dime store on Anchorage 's Fourth Avenue , a main business thoroughfare of one and two-story buildings . He turned to merchandising after six years of college , including two years toward a doctorate in horticulture . " The problem here is money , " the 42-year-old sandy-haired merchant grinned . " If I could ' solve that , there would be no ethers . Yet I think there is much more opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else I 've been . " Mr. Leonard does have problems that store owners " outside " do not encounter to the same degree . " You 're a long way from your source of supply , " he said , as he unpacked a shipment of lamp shades that he had ordered three months ago . " In Seattle a merchant out of a hot-selling item can stop at a wholesale house , load his car with a fresh supply and be hi business with it the next morning . I have to have such a big stock because of the transportation situation that I ca n't turn it over right away . " Goods Travel Far The items piled on the counters and shelves of Leonard 's Varieties  --  from " penny candy that we really sell for a penny " to $25 toys  --  are shipped by Alaska Steamship Company freighters from Seattle to Seward , then by the Alaska Railroad to this city . " One year during a boat strike , " the merchant said , " I practically bought an airline but I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not so bail off as the merchants out in Nome , where the year 's first boat does n't arrive until June and the last one leaves in late summer . There you have to guess what the people will want all winter . " There is some improvement here ' because we now have a couple of wholesalers in Anchorage . That has its drawback , too : the easier it is to get your merchandise the more competitors you 're going to have . " But four dime stores in Mr. Leonard 's neighborhood have closed , he noted , leaving three . Another problem he faces is the turnover in help . He has two salesgirls now . He has had as many as fifty-four different employes during a year . Many ' have been wives of military personnel . ' " Pregnancy and rotation really take their toll , " Mr. Leonard murmured . He pays $1.83 an hour for experienced help , $1.56 for salesgirls without experience . They belong to the Retail Clerks Union . The merchant sees " maybe a dozen " regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . He does most of his ordering by mail . " Sometimes , " he complained , " you see as many as ten salesmen a day in the summer . I feel like throwing them out . A lot of them do n't intend to work Alaska but come up for vacations and bring their samples with them . " He himself has been outside Alaska only twice in seventeen years  --  each time on a fortyday buying trip . There is talk of national chains of dime stores invading the forty-ninth state . A homeowned affiliate of the Ben Franklin group of variety stores does operate in Anchorage . Few Alaska merchants seem content to stick exclusively to one business . Mr. Leonard is no exception . He tried automobiles on the side , bought into a bowling alley , sold his stock in the alley to help recoup his losses suffered in his sortie into the car field . " I have been set back several years but am getting back on my feet , " he noted . He came to Alaska in 1941 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to work in the ' store he now owns . The son of a Phorticulturist , he says he was passing a variety stbre in Tacoma , Wash. , and became curious about how the manager kept track of all the items . " I went inside to inquire , " he related , " and this fellow put me Ito work . " Serves on City Council Mr. Leonard 's eyes light up when he talks of the extracurricular fields available to an Alaska merchant for the askMg . He took a plunge into politics last fall and was elected to the City Council . He is a 1Kiwanian , active in the Charnher of Commerce and a volunteer fireman . He instructs Boy Scouts in winter survival , coaches swimming and life saving , teaches two church school classes and conducts a service every Sunday for pre-school children at the Episcopal Church . Mr. Leonard 's wife , the former Mary Patricia Park of Seattle , a University of Washington graduate librarian , dropped into the store from a tea and agreed that social life in Alaska could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when you have to say no . " " Ask me how I like living in Alaska when it 's not quite so cold , " Mrs. Leonard suggested . " But I will say this : I 've been ' outside ' ( to Seattle ) with the children a number of times and , although it may sound crazy , every time I go out I can hardly wait to get back to Alaska . " Juneau Fisherman Ernest Kohlhase is a fisherman , one of the myriad cogs in Alaska 's Number One industry . On Monday morning , May 4 , he will take a few sandwiches , three or four steaks , a tin of coffee and an alarm clock and chug leisurely down the Gastineau Channel from Juneau 's boat harbor . He will be headed , in his thirty-two -f oot gasoline - motored , fishing craft , the Gull , for waters that he hopes will be teeming with King salmon ? twenty-five-pound beauties . Three hours later , at high noon , he will pay out his 150-fathom ( 900 foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty of them , will be unspooling their own nets as they drift with their boats in a fixed area eight to ten miles long . An hour or two later Mr. Kohlhase will pull in his almost invisible nylon net and take out the fish that have been caught , behind the gills , in its meshes . Then he will pay out the net again and wait for the innocent salmon to come by and accommodatingly build up his bank account . " You keep on like this around the clock for a three-day stretch every week . " the 6-foot 1-inch , 200-pound fisherman related . His wife poured coffee in their comfortable , three - bed - room frame house , where they " winterize " just beyond the bridge over the channel opposite Juneau . Mr. Kohlhase had built the house himself . A television set , a radio , an electric stove , refrigerator , washer and dryer ? all the conveniences of a modern dwelling in " the lower forty-eight " ? were in evidence . Mr. Kohlhase resumed : " I am alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep eight hours at a time and drift over the forbidden line or get their webs tangled up . " Three days a week are all you 're allowed , from May 1 tol Oct. 1 , the five-month season . ' It 's a guessing game . Where you put out your net might mean the difference between catching twg or three fish and two or three hundred . " Once a day a packer comes around and services you . You take a one-pronged pitchfork , ( spear your fish in the head and toss them one at a time into his boat . He has scales and money . He weighs the fish on the spot and pays you off right there . " $1,000 a Day Was Tops ? Sometimes the cash that changes hands is not worth the six-hour round trip to the fishing ground . But there are rewarding days , too . Mr. Kohlhase 's best day in a dozen years of fishing out of Juneau netted him just under $1,000 . That , he emphasized , was a once-in-alifetime feat . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get back from a three-day fishing trip ? " he was asked . He grinned . " No , to the Bubble Room . You 've got to keep your money in circulation . " The Bubble Room is the Baranof Hotel 's bar and dining area , with dance floor and small orchestra  --  a favorite gathering place of Juneau residents and visitors . Mr. Kohlhase ? " I 'm 52 , am I not ? " he asked his comely wife  --  was born at Kaltenkirchen , near Hamburg , Germany , and came to Alaska from Seattle in 1926 . He built fish traps , worked at a cannery and finally " slithered " into becoming a fisherman himself . This was after a fifteen-year stint as a blue fox fur farm owner on Harbor Island , forty miles southeast of Juneau . " The bottom dropped out of the fur market , " he recalled . " I was going in the hole every year so I quit keeping books. ! ! When I did n't keep books wel kept eating . " Mr. Kohlhase moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own fishing boat and plunged into his new occupation . Is he a typical factor in Alaska 's fishing industry that has been on the toboggan because of poor salmon runs ? " What is a typical fisherman ? " he countered . " Some are , doing better than others . In they west there Ware some practically1 disaster areas where fishing has been so poor . You have good years , you have bad years . " Fishermen are not entitled to unemployment insurance unless they are on a boat with four or more hands . Some quit fishing early in the season and get jobs that will entitle them to benefits when they are laid ! off in winter . Many Alaskans have several irons in the fire to help them keep going financially . Mr. Kohlhase decided to " get busy and work up a cushion against bad times . " He had " got bored sitting around " and the soil was not good for gardening , He took up the hobby of building houses . " I 've put up five so far ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' renting four of them . I 'm think- , ing of trying a duplex . I just dream them up and build them . " Is it a hard life to be mar-1 tied to a fisherman ? " One gets used to it , " Mrs. Kohlhase philosophized . " There 's ! Iwo schedule here . Nor was there , in fox farming , where he got up at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning . I cooked fish heads while he ! was getting supplies . We ate , whenever he was ready for it . ' , 1 Mr. Kohlhase cautioned that an independent fisherman had to figure . on about $3,000 ex penses for a season . A gross of 1$5,000 or $6,000 he said , would be " on the high side " of the average , but some get three or four times as much as others . He is sold on the forty-ninth state : " There is more quiet and relaxed living here . There 's a freedom and a democratic way of , living in Alaska that , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . " Fairbanks Teacher Miss Ethyl Peasgood felt conscience-stricken when she moved into a Fairbanks apartment with running water and began teaching a class of first graders in a modern school house . The absence of a big stove in the middle of the classroom bothered her . The electric washer ire ' her apartment house basement was a striking contrast to the scrub board she had toiled over ' every Saturday  --  wash day ? during her years in remote areas of Alaska . Miss Peasgood had dreamed , on the farm in North Dakota , of teaching eight grades in a oneroom log school , The Hjalmar ' Nordale School in which she directs twenty-eight enthusiastic pupils is a two-story building , spotless and well equipped . But this brunette with a quick smile had realized her dream long before she quit " roughing it " for a relatively easy life in Fairbanks , the old sourdough " capital . " She taught Eskimo and Indian children in a one-room log hut out in the " bush " at Takotna , 300 miles to the southwest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partitioned off from the schoolroom . Freezing logs would crack on sub-zero nights and scare her half to death . In winter she chopped holes in the ice to get drinking water . She cooked on a kerosene stove and ate on her lap . Led Sunday School She assembled the villagers ? from infants en arms to an 83-year-old grandmether ? at the school on Sundays by starting a kind of " churchy Sunday school . " She even conducted funeral services . At Bethel , a fishing town near the Bering Sea to which she transferred later , the only runMng water was " water that ran by in the Kuskokwim River . " The town did , however , have electricity . " We used melted snow one winter for a solid month when the water deliverer could n't get through , " Miss Peasgood recalled . " I took a bath , washed my hair , laundered my clothes and scrubbed my floor -- all with the same water . " She confessed to being thrilled with the years of experience in Alaskan villages . " People have misconceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avidly . You have to read to hold your own with them . Life can be enriched in so many ways . You sort of do your own thinking , and there is something to be said for that , too . " At Bethel we had the Woman 's Club , the Chamber of Commerce , an international relations organization , a library and health council , and you were expected to attend all the meetings . " There was always some ! meeting or practice . I played the organ at church and the piano at school . I had Sunday school classes in the children 's ward and adult ward at the hospital . At night we heard the doctor , over the short wave radio , i dagnose ailments and prescribelreatment for persons , far out in the ' bush ' . " A Fine Fur Collection Here in Fairbanks Miss Peas- ' good has the usual television set , electric stove and electric refrigerator . Her collection of fur wraps would be the envy of many a woman from San Francisco to New York . Former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moose meat . She reports to school at 8:30 A. M. and usually stays until 6 in the evening , She explained : " The more preparation you have , the better the next day will be . " Her presidency of the Alaska Education Association of more than 2,000 members has added to her work during the last year and a half . Alaskan school teachers hold odd jobs and travel in summer . Miss Peasgood worked a summer as matron of the jail in Bethel . She was housekeeper at a cannery , making beds . She , earned money that way for trips to Hawaii and England . A Try at Gold Panning She has traveled the 2,000-mile length of the Yukon River in all kinds of boats . She learned to pan gold and mush sled dogs . With her shotgun she has bagged spruce hen and ptarmigan . The teachers ' salary schedule for Alaska ranges from a minimum of $4,600 a year in the Juneau division for a Bachelor of Arts degree holder without experience , to a maximum of $6,550 ( after eight years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Master 's degree draw higher pay . Most of the larger towns pay higher than the minimum scales , some substantially higher . Palmer Farmer Gary LaRose tried to plow a Straight furrow between lyricism and realism when he talks about , a farmer 's life in Alaska . He came to the Matanuska ' Valley in 1935 in the Roosevelt ) Administration 's controversial , depression-era agricultural ex periment . He was ten years old . He has 160 acres two farms away from the one on which his father Henry , a steel and concrete construction worker from Phillips , Wis. , settled the family . A cheerful , dark-haired father of five , he takes life with comparative ease in this cold winter , weather . He stays abed until ' 7 o'clock and he is through with the milking and other chores ' in a couple of hours . Looking after his twenty-one head of cattle , including ten registered Holsteins and his two pack horse , : also takes two or three hours in the evening . If he does not feel like work ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief hours of daylight at this time of year , there is always Big Lake , twenty miles from Palmer . " I do quite a bit of ice fishing between chores , " he said as he peeled off his parka and sat down before a roaring oil heater in the living room . The 33-year-old dairyman and his wife Rosemary cautioned that farming here was no sinecure. like the Independent part of it , " Mr. LaRose said . " I do n't have to answer to anybody exicept myself . It 's a worthwhile occupation but I would n't advise a lot of people to come up here and try it at present unless they are able to buy a place . " He pleaded half in jest : " But do n't scare scare people away ! " His wife added : " Alaska grows on you . It 's not easy farming here but it 's worth the struggle . I feel there 's a good future for the children ? as much security for them as in any farming area of the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , mean an eighteen-hour work day for the LaRoses . " I 'm up around 4:30 , " the dairyman said . " I do the milking and turn the cows out to ( pasture ? if the pasture 's up yet  --  and then Rosemary always has breakfast ready . If there 's no fence fixing to do I spend all day on , the tractor  --  sometimes skip lunch . " To conserve ground moisture in the spring , Mr. LaRose plows an area only big enough to plant the same day . He plows , disks , drags and plants . He is ! often on the tractor until 11 or 12 o'clock at night , He has to get an early start ( because the valley 's growing season is not more than fourteen weeks . Temperatures during the year range from 40 . degrees below to 85 degrees above zero . Cleared 76 Acres The LaRoses had only thirty acres of cleared land when they took over the 160-acre place . The energetic farmer now has 106 acres cleared . He and his attractive blonde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leased the farm in 1919 for two years , before buying it , " Clearing land runs about 15200 an acre by the time you get it shaped up for a secondyear crop , " Mr. LaRose estimated .
