txt Whether a state constitutional convention will be held this year is now up to the Massachusetts Senate and possibly may hinge on an interpretation of the Massachusetts Constitution itself . The House , after another sud -- den shift in Democratic majority strategy , adopted on May 9 an order for a May 11 joint House-Senate session to consider proposed amendments to permit levying of a graduated state income tax and an 18-year voting age . Wednesday , May 11 , is the final day on which a convention may open under legislative order . Senate majority Republicans are caucusing today on the convention issue . Many Senate GOP leaders , including Senator Newland H. Holmes ( R ) of Weymouth , Senate majority leader , would prefer that no convention be held this year . They are particularly opposed to a graduated state income tax amendment . If a convention is held they are ready to insist it act on a pending amendment providing for a four-year term foi . governor and five other constitutional officers . I Approval Won This amendment won the first of two legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 1956 session it would go on the ballot in 1956 and , if approved . would go into effect at the 1958 state election . But the House Democrats have voted to delay action until next year , so that they can vote on a four-year term measure effective in the 1960 presidential election , when their victory prospects would be considered better . Whether a convention will be held this year , however . remains much in question . Some GOP leaders , such as Senator Holmes , favor the Senate taking no action on a date this year , If no date is set by the Senate , Senator Holmes contends no session can be held . if the Senate fails to act by tomorrow , according to this view , the final day for holding a session would have passed . Constitutional Clause However , the state constitution provides that if the two branches fail to agree on a date , the Governor shall call the two branches into session . But this provision is considered vague by constitutional authorities . Many authorities contend that the Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May . Furthermore , they insist the Governor will not officially know whether the House and Senate have failed to agree on a date until midnight tomorrow , closing the second Wednesday in May . On the other hand , many persons feel the Governor can , and would be obligated under the constitution to , call the convention , even after the second Wednesday , upon House-Senate disagreement . But there is no penalty cited in the constitution for failure to do so . This provision has never been tested in the courts . Prospects Seen Fair The House vote calling up the graduated income tax and the 18-year voting age would seem to indicate both have a fair chance of passage in a joint session , if one is held . However , much could happen between now and a final vote . A proposed amendment must be approved by 141 members , by a majority of the elected members of both branches , in two successive legislatures , before going to the people .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
