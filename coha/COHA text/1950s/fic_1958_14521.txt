As the curtain rises , the stage is dark . We hear TOBEY 'S voice . He is nearing sixty , and the voice comes from his meditation on a vanished past and particularly on the enigma of a lost but still-abiding friendship of his youth . Through the dissolving darkness we hear a lovely , plaintive melody : the oboe passage from the second movement of Handel 's Water Music . TOBEY I find as I grow older that I keep going back to my friendship with Willie  --  when we were young and happy and living in Worcester , Massachusetts , in the early years of the century . Willie was always preoccupied with mystery  --  the mystery of life  --  the mystery of death . He used to illuminate all my childish problems for me . But he left me an inheritance of the greatest mystery of all : why he killed himself , why he felt he had to do it . What were the steep dark walls in Willie 's mind that converged on him to destroy him ? I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my relationship with him  --  and on his relationships with others  --  was that he was the most life-giving person I have ever known . I remember still the first mysteries I brought him to solve : the mystery of infinity , the mystery of the True Name of the Lord . Did Willie , at the end , ponder these mysteries ? Had he sought the True Name ? Did he , I wonder , come too close ? I do n't know . I shall never know . I can only tell what I can remember . ( While TOBEY 'S meditation is going on , we gradually light up to the scene of the play : an early evening in the summer of 1908 , in Worcester , Massachusetts . Then we see WILLIE LAVIN and TOBEY standing at the foot of the hill . WILLIE is a young man of twenty , TOBEY is a boy of twelve , wearing glasses and carrying a strapped bag of school books .

TOBEY We 're standing here , are n't we  --  at the corner of Exchange and Green ? WILLIE Precisely . TOBEY Above us is the sky . Right ? WILLIE Right . TOBEY Now above that sky  --  let 's say a million miles away  --  there 's another sky . WILLIE I 'll grant that . TOBEY Let 's say there are a million skies beyond that sky . A trillion . All right ? WILLIE I 'm with you , Tobey  --  at the trillionth sky . TOBEY ( His voice rising in triumph ) Well , what 's beyond the last sky ? There must be an end to it someplace .

WILLIE ( As they walk down the street ) I disagree with your father . It 's a problem  --  like other problems . It can be analyzed . Resolved into its component parts . TOBEY ( With sublime confidence in WILLIE ) I knew you 'd have some ideas about it , Willie ! You 're a scientist ! You know everything . ( The sound of the oboe captures them ) WILLIE Dr. Jim Nightingale practicing his oboe . Let 's look in on him . What else does your father tell you not to think about ? TOBEY It seems that the Lord has many names but no one knows the True Name . He tells me not to try to find out the True Name . WILLIE Why not ? TOBEY Because my father says that those who come close to it are destroyed . But infinity does bother me .

JIM NIGHTINGALE 'S office . It is very shabby , with a dilapidated , sagging horsehair sofa . DR . NIGHTINGALE , a rusty dressed , stocky little man of about forty , with vivacious dark eyes and dark skin , cherry cheeked , is standing before a music stand , tootling on his oboe with complete absorption .

JIM NIGHTINGALE ( Points to music on stand ) Handel 's Water Music  --  Ought to hear my teacher play it . First oboeist of the Boston Symphony . TOBEY I 'd like to be a pianist . JIM NIGHTINGALE Why do n't you ? TOBEY No piano in the house . JIM NIGHTINGALE ( Takes an obstetrical manual from a shelf ) Here ! Amuse yourself with this . WILLIE ( Curious ) What 's that ? JIM NIGHTINGALE ( Winks at WILLIE ) Manual of obstetrics . The kids come in here and devour the illustrations . TOBEY ( Rises , moves back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Urging it on him ) Come on  --  nothing wrong with it . It 's science . Maybe you 'll be a gynecologist . Easier than being a pianist TOBEY ( Hideously embarrassed ) No , thanks . WILLIE Quit it , Jim . You 're embarrassing him . p. 7 JIM NIGHTINGALE What 's embarrassing about the facts of life ? ( But he gives up as he sees TOBEY 'S averted face , and throws the book on the sofa . He picks up a magazine instead and gives that to TOBEY ) Well , here 's " Puck . " You can look at the funny pictures ( TOBEY grabs it , happy to absorb himself in " Puck . " JIM turns to WILLIE ) Well , Willie , how 're you getting on at W.P.I. ? How 's the chemistry ? What are you on ? WILLIE Knee-deep in colloids . JIM NIGHTINGALE Who 've you got ? WILLIE Professor Jackson . JIM NIGHTINGALE Oh , he 's good , Professor Jackson . He comes in here .

JIM NIGHTINGALE How 's your mother ? p. 8 TOBEY She 's gone to New York to see Professor Jacobi . JIM NIGHTINGALE I know that . When 's she coming home ? TOBEY I do n't know . JIM NIGHTINGALE All right , kid . ( TOBEY goes back to " Puck .

And he goes twice a week to Boston for music lessons . ( Dreaming for a moment ) If there 's one thing in the world I 'd like to do WILLIE What ? TOBEY Play the piano . WILLIE Well  --  why not ?

( He picks up his oboe ) p. 10 TOBEY ( Aghast ) Well  --  are n't you going to do something ? JIM NIGHTINGALE Oh , do n't worry , it is n't going to happen tonight . ( To WILLIE , as he puts the oboe down ) Diabetes . WILLIE ( Casually ) Who ? JIM NIGHTINGALE ( Equally casually ) Your friend Dan Eisner . There ! I violated a professional oath .

JIM NIGHTINGALE If he 's told her , she knows . If he has n't , she does n't . None of my business . WILLIE But if it 's true  --  then Myra  --  JIM NIGHTINGALE In three or four years she 'll be a beautiful widow . That 's a good kind of widow to be !

He turns to go ) WILLIE Well , Tobey , time to move on , I guess . ( TOBEY gets up , at the ready ) p. 12 JIM NIGHTINGALE ( Rises ) What about dinner ? I 'll treat you both at Putnam and Thurston 's . WILLIE No , thank you , Jim . We 've eaten . JIM NIGHTINGALE Sorry if what I told you WILLIE ( Anything to get off that subject ) That sofa is pretty dilapidated , Jim . Been here since I can remember . Ca n't you afford a new sofa ?

To WILLIE ) You too , Willie  --  any time  --  we 'll talk chemistry . p. 13 WILLIE ( Ca n't wait to be off ) Sure . TOBEY Good-bye , Dr. Nightingale . Thank you . JIM NIGHTINGALE Good-bye , kid . WILLIE So long , Jim . ( The moment they go JIM is back at the music stand and playing Handel 's Water Music . This music carries us over to the first part of the next scene . Once they are outside , WILLIE and TOBEY start walking down the street ) TOBEY You did n't answer my question  --  what 's a gynecologist ?

TOBEY ( Bubbles eagerly ) Just like the posters of John Drew  --  you 've seen them , Willie ? A high stiff collar  --  with straight lines  --  and his tie , knotted so nice between them  --  ( His voice trails off in awe and wonder ) p. 14 WILLIE I still do n't see TOBEY I mean  --  if he 's dying  --  how can he take so much trouble with his tie ? WILLIE Maybe he does n't believe it . ( WILLIE and TOBEY walk on through the leafy summer evening  --  full of promise  --  of that evening , of the next day , of the veiled funnel of the future .

Nice fellows , but they 're a bit excessively down to earth . TOBEY I 'm lucky to have a friend like you . WILLIE It 's a natural affinity between sympathetic temperaments . ( He smiles at TOBEY . TOBEY glows . By this time they have reached the stoop in front of the house . They sit down on it ) p. 15 TOBEY ( Suddenly ) You know what I think Dan should do WILLIE That 's mental telepathy .

TOBEY No . You can outfight him if you hold on fast enough . He comes at night . He 's always at our house , you know , Willie  --  to take my mother . Every night Father says his night prayer , about those four good angels and I have confidence in them , so I fall asleep . But then I wake up  --  and he 's standing there , the Dark One , grabbing at me , to take me away WILLIE ( Fascinated ) What 's he look like ? TOBEY He has n't got any face  --  yet he looks at you  --  with something . He 's not angry or anything  --  he just wants to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? TOBEY No . I hold on to the bedposts .

You 're marrying her off to somebody else , are n't you ? IDA To a very rich millionaire from Atlanta . WILLIE Why should I melt in vain ? TOBEY Why does n't he go right to Fitchburg ? Why does he have to come here ? IDA Because he 's very high-tone , the furrier from Atlanta , and Fitchburg is no place to meet a bride . TOBEY What 's wrong with Fitchburg ? IDA When your uncle  --  may he rest in peace  --  married me he took me for a honeymoon to Fitchburg on the streetcar . It spoiled the whole honeymoon . So be sure , Willie , and bring her up the moment she gets here . ( IDA goes inside . The lights come up , right , as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing IDA 'S parlor .

IDA looks around her domain with satisfaction ) It looks nice everything , you think so , Ren ? She will like it , Leah from Fitchburg . Atlanta will like it ? You like it , Ren ? p. 18 REN ( Without looking up from The Ancient Mariner ) Fine . IDA ( Mild reproval ) Why do you say fine when you do n't even look ? Maybe you will go up the hill to Lover 's Lane and bring back some flowers ? REN I 'm trying to do my homework ! IDA So you 'll be a schoolteacher two weeks later !

IDA ( Studying the photograph with detachment ) Handsome he is , but he has no neck . REN Why was Pa so anxious about Leah ? IDA Before he went into the real estate your father used to peddle around Fitchburg . Leah 's mother ran there a restaurant , and Poppa used to go there .

RAPPAPORT Mrs. Feinberg , I promise you if you give me from Leah another photograph IDA You will excuse me , Rappaport , but Leah 's photograph is too private for a public matchmaker that deals with crooks . And as for this furrier  --  to him I do  --  ( She picks up Atlanta 's photograph )  --  what I 'd like to do to you , Rappaport . A neck he has n't got or I 'd break it ! ( She tears the Atlantan 's photograph to pieces and hurls them into RAPPAPORT 'S face ) p. 31 RAPPAPORT ( Really desperate , he can not afford to have IDA for an enemy ) Mrs. Feinberg , I promise  --  on my late wife 's memory , may she rest in peace  --  I promise you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of honor , Mrs. Feinberg , I swear you IDA Do n't swear , Rappaport , by what you have n't got .

But it 's good I did n't because a cripple ca n't walk out of the room . ( Dramatically she walks to the door and holds it open for him ) So march , Rappaport , before I get calmer ! RAPPAPORT ( Pleading ) Mrs. Feinberg ! ( His cough returns . Cowering , but with enough presence of mind to retrieve the nosegay , RAPPAPORT makes an ignominious exit out the main doorway and up the hill . REN enters from kitchen .

He is about sixty , still vigorous , with the look of a benevolent Saracen .

SACHER You 're not reading in a good light , Tobey . You 'll strain your eyes . TOBEY ( With excitement ) Willie 's coming to see you . MR . SACHER Oh . TOBEY Yes . He 's got a dilemma . MR .

SACHER has touched a sensitive membrane ) Why  --  to save Myra . MR . SACHER Is this your motive ? To save Myra ? WILLIE ( Squirms ) Whatever it is  --  do n't you think she ought to be told ? MR . SACHER Is Jim Nightingale God ? WILLIE ( With some heat ) He 's a damn good doctor ! MR . SACHER Can he read the future ? How does he know that some cure will not be discovered ? Or that Dan may not be the exception who recovers ? My dear wife has been given up several times . Yet God has seen fit to spare her . WILLIE Jim says it 's inevitable . MR .

SACHER Myra would be bound , unless released by Dan 's family , to marry Dan 's younger brother , Aaron , who professes to be in love with her too . WILLIE What is that law ? MR . SACHER It is called the levirate law . ( FATHER goes to book-shelves and hand him a book ) There 's been a great deal written about it . Here is something on it  --  in English .

You 're so beautiful , Myra . All the beauty of the world is in your face . MYRA No one says the things you do , Aaron .

The feeling is fine and that 's the important thing . I go by feeling . With me everything is feeling . ( AARON is not comforted . MYRA rattles on ) Aaron , do you know something ? We 're going to New York on our honeymoon ! ( She giggles rapturously ) Honeymoon ! And guess where we 're going to stay ? Did Dan tell you ?

We are not living in ancient times . MR . SACHER This will only bring us back to our old argument faith versus reason . You are a good boy , Willie ( Smiles at him ) though a scientist ! You came to ask my advice . People who ask your advice usually want it to justify a course they have already decided on . You have probably decided , already , to tell Myra p. 39 WILLIE ( In self-defense ) If I had , why would n't I just have gone and done it why did I come to you ? MR . SACHER Then all I can say is look into your heart  --  ask yourself why you 're doing it . Is it to save Myra ? Or to save her for yourself ? ( Going to WILLIE ) Go home , my son , and think .

SACHER has probed to the truth ) WILLIE Well  --  thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ) Good night , my boy . ( WILLIE goes out . MR . SACHER , deeply disturbed , begins again to repeat his prayer , pacing the floor . Intoning ) " Before me Uriel , behind me Raphael , and over my head the divine presence of God .

MYRA ( Overcome ) Oh Dan ( DAN takes out jeweler 's box and shows her the ring , flashing it in the moonlight . She coos with delight ) Oh , Dan ! It 's beautiful . DAN ( With pride ) Three carat ! ( Waves it before her tantalizingly ) Not yours yet , you know . ( He winks at WILLIE . MYRA giggles ) Depends on your behavior . Want to try it on ? ( He gives her the ring . She puts it on ) Fits ? MYRA Perfect . Just perfect . I love it . Oh , Dan !

By the way , Myra  --  you have n't kissed me  --  as per usual MYRA ( Disinclined ) Not in front of Willie ! DAN That do n't make it worse  --  it makes it better ! ( He kisses her .

I wo n't let him but I 'll let you TOBEY I mean  --  about the Angel  --  DAN What angel ? TOBEY The Angel of Death . I know he 's after you . WILLIE ( Horrified , tries to shush TOBEY ) Tobey  --  hush  --  TOBEY ( To WILLIE ) I heard Father say  --  you must n't do it  --  so I have to do it DAN ( Has gone ashen in rage ) What 's the damn kid babbling about ? TOBEY ( Not to be deterred ) You must hold on tight to the bedposts do n't let him take your hand away once you let him you 'll be you 'll be p. 43 DAN ( In a fury ) Shut up , you little ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOBEY . DAN turns on WILLIE ) You put him up to this , you bastard ! MYRA ( Frightened ) What does he mean ? Dan ? WILLIE ( Explains to both of them ) You know with his mother sick all the time he has these fantasies at night he 's afraid he 's going to lose his mother MYRA But why to Dan ? DAN ( To WILLIE ; he is trembling with anger and with fear too ) I wo n't forget this  --  I 'll tell you that ! MYRA Dan ! Is there anything wrong with you ? DAN ( Shouts ) I 'm in great shape I tell you ! Never felt better in my life ! MYRA Then why are you so so ? DAN ( In better control ; with mechanical bravado , points to WILLIE ) It 's that jealous He put the kid up to it . ( To WILLIE ) Wo n't do you a bit of good , my friend . ( To MYRA , masterfully ) You come upstairs with me . Away from these How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . p. 44 MYRA ( Completely diverted , flashes the ring before her with a slow , undulating motion ) It 's just beautiful . I just love it ! ( She takes it from him and slips it on her finger ) DAN ( Jumps up the stairs ) Come on , Myra . MYRA ( Hypnotized by the ring ) They 're bound to notice it , do n't you think so , Willie , in the lobby of the Hotel Astor ? DAN ( From the top of the stoop ) I 'm waiting for you , Myra ! MYRA Coming Dan ( She follows him ; they disappear up the steps into the house . A silence for a moment between WILLIE and TOBEY ) TOBEY Are you angry with me , Willie ? WILLIE No , but your father will be if he finds out you 're not in bed . TOBEY ( As he goes up on stoop and sits on the bench ) How can Myra not love you , Willie ? WILLIE ( Following him ) She manages ! ( WILLIE has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncorked it , and he now shakes some liquid onto his hands and rubs them dry ) p. 45 TOBEY What 's that ? WILLIE Alcohol . Air is full of germs . Protects the hands from germs . ( He replaces the bottle in his sweater pocket ) TOBEY I 'll be glad when Myra gets married . WILLIE ( Sits beside him ) Why ? TOBEY I do n't know  --  I just feel  --  I do n't know  --  I 'll be glad . WILLIE I 'm going to wait for her . TOBEY ( Shocked , scared ) You mean you 're going to wait  --  till the Dark One takes Dan away ? WILLIE Yes . TOBEY Gee , that 's scarey . WILLIE ( Edgy ) Why ? TOBEY I do n't know . It seems something funny about it . WILLIE ( Gets up ) I know what you feel . Tell you the truth , it kind of scares me too . TOBEY Then why do you do it ? WILLIE Myra will need me . ( A moment ) It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's for Myra to be free I 'll wait . p. 46 TOBEY ( Quickly ) But is n't it the same thing ? ( This is unanswerable . WILLIE is stumped ) WILLIE ( Finally , with a sense of guilty evasion ) You have a logical mind , Tobey ! TOBEY Anyway , Father says if anything happens to Dan , Aaron will have the right  --  WILLIE I 'd like to see them try it ! I 'm beginning to think you 're much too preoccupied with angels . ( Sits beside him ) Might be a good idea if you cultivated an outdoor hobby . TOBEY ( That would settle it ) Have you got one ? WILLIE I am beginning to think seriously about fishing . TOBEY Why do n't you ? WILLIE First I have to master the theory of fishing . There 's a considerable literature , you know , on fishing  --  different methods , different techniques . TOBEY Allie Seidenberg just fishes . WILLIE Well , he 's just an empiricist . TOBEY What 's an empiricist ? WILLIE I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Smiles at TOBEY ) The peripatetic method . p. 47 TOBEY ( Increasingly bewildered ) What 's that ? WILLIE I 'll explain that too . TOBEY All right . ( The sound of the streetcar has been heard , growing louder during the last few speeches . It comes to a halt in front of No. 31 ) Somebody 's getting off . Could it be my mother ? ( He jumps off the stoop and goes part way up the hill ) WILLIE Oh , no . She 's not expected yet . TOBEY ( Disappointed , peers through the gloom ) It 's only a girl ! ( He comes back to the steps ) WILLIE ( Peering also ) Maybe it 's Leah from Fitchburg . ( LEAH , carrying a cheap suitcase , walks into the shaft of light that comes from the tenement windows . WILLIE jumps to his feet . LEAH is an extremely attractive young girl . To LEAH ) Can I help you , miss ? LEAH I 'm looking for a Mrs. Feinberg . WILLIE Are you , by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How did you know ? p. 48 WILLIE ( Jumps off stoop ) I 'm Sherlock Holmes ! Mrs. Feinberg lives right there on the left . She 's expecting you . ( Gallantly ) You see ! Your reputation has preceded you ! LEAH ( Shyly ) Thank you . WILLIE I 'm Willie Lavin . LEAH I 'm very glad to meet you . WILLIE This is Tobey . LEAH ( Smiles at him ) Hello , Tobey . WILLIE Here , let me have your suitcase . LEAH Oh , thank you ! WILLIE From what I hear  --  congratulations are in order . LEAH ( Intensely embarrassed ) Really ? Why ? WILLIE ( Not noticing ) May I say that the gentleman from Atlanta is a very lucky man ? ( Her agitation is now so pronounced that WILLIS does notice ) LEAH Oh , Mr. Lavin  --  I  --  I  --  WILLIE ( Concerned ) Do you feel faint , Miss  --  ? p. 49 LEAH  --  Long . I just felt a bit dizzy  --  I do n't know why WILLIE Here  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( She sits on the stoop ) WILLIE It 's a long ride from Fitchburg . Were you , by any chance , carsick ? LEAH Oh , no  --  it 's just that  --  it 's bewildering after Fitchburg to find myself in this big city all of a sudden  --  and  --  and  --  WILLIE As a bride ? To a man you 've never met . ( LEAH does not answer . She is miserable . WILLIE sees it ) I 'm sorry if I  --  TOBEY ( Cuts in ) Worcester is built on seven hills , you know . Like Rome . Rome was built on seven hills . LEAH ( Smiles at him ) Was it ? TOBEY The highest is Mount Wachusett . You can see it from almost any place . I 've been to the top twice . Willie can we take her to the top of Mount Wachusett ? WILLIE Sure , why not ? LEAH I 'd love to go . p. 50 WILLIE Fine . We 'll go . LEAH You are the son of Lavin and Lupkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) That is an approximate statement . More accurately I am the son of Mr. Lavin , who is the senior partner of Lavin and Lupkin . Biologically speaking , I have no relationship whatever to Mr. Lupkin . LEAH ( She laughs ) You are very funny . WILLIE ( After a moment ) The gossip has it that the lucky gentleman is a very well-off citizen of Atlanta , Georgia . LEAH ( Acutely embarrassed ) I see everybody knows it . That only makes it worse ! WILLIE ( Comes right to the point ) Have you got cold feet , Leah ? LEAH Oh , Mr. Lavin WILLIE Willie . LEAH Oh , Willie , I feel so ungrateful ! WILLIE ( Cracks his knuckles ) I can very well imagine a situation where at the very altar ( Firmly ) Where , at the very altar , the bride will relinquish the groom . I will go so far as to say that unless the impulse toward this person is overwhelming it is your duty to break off this engagement . p. 51 LEAH But Ida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might say . She hardly knows me . She 's taken so much trouble . WILLIE Ida , out of the goodness of her heart , has found husbands for the halt , the lame and the blind  --  she will have no problem whatever with you , Leah . TOBEY ( Proudly ) Ida 's my aunt . LEAH Is she ? TOBEY Oh , yes . Is n't she , Willie ? WILLIE Beyond the shadow of a doubt . LEAH ( Gets up . Impulsively she kisses TOBEY . To WILLIE ) I ca n't tell you how much better you 've made me feel . You 've taken such a load off my mind . I only hope I have the courage to  --  to WILLIE ( Rise ) Tell you what I 'll do . In a few minutes I 'll look in on you at Ida 's . If you have n't summoned the courage to tell her by that time , I 'll do it for you . LEAH I ca n't tell you how grateful I am ! WILLIE It is the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in moments of crisis . I venture to say that the opportunity may some day come for you to help me. p. 52 LEAH Oh , I hope it does . ( NORBERT MANDEL comes walking up the hill , swaggering and complacent . He carries a cane . He is around forty . He has a ginger-colored mustache  --  which he twirls elegantly , especially when he is meditating something  --  and ginger-colored , thinning hair ) WILLIE AND TOBEY Good evening , Mr. Mandel . ( MANDEL nods condescendingly ) NORBERT MANDEL Good evening . Enjoying the moonlight ? ( He notices LEAH ) WILLIE This is Miss Long just arrived from Fitchburg . NORBERT MANDEL Good evening , Miss Long . LEAH Good evening . NORBERT MANDEL Are you the bride of the lucky gentleman from Atlanta ? LEAH ( Greatly embarrassed ) Well , I do n't know NORBERT MANDEL I am Norbert Mandel . I am the proprietor of this property . My own residence is just on the top of the hill , very noticeable by its stain-glass window . LEAH How nice . NORBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had I known she had so charming a client Norbert Mandel would have expressed a personal interest . p. 53 LEAH ( In agony ) Thank you . NORBERT MANDEL I have just completed the purchase of a Winton Six . Consider it will be at your service any time should you care to see our fair countryside . Good night . ( MANDEL continues his stately progress up the hill ) LEAH Oh , dear . Everybody knows about it and now if it does n't happen , what will Mrs. Feinberg say ? WILLIE Do n't worry about Ida . I will straighten it out with her . LEAH Well , I 'd better be going up . Ida will be wondering . Which floor is it ? WILLIE I 'll show you . ( WILLIE leads LEAH up the steps to the main door , carrying her suitcase ) LEAH And you 'll really come ? WILLIE You may count on me . LEAH That 's wonderful ! WILLIE By that time you will have crossed the Rubicon . If not  --  I 'll cross it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hands her her suitcase , and points the direction of IDA 'S door ) WILLIE ( Looking after LEAH ) I venture the opinion that that is a very estimable young lady . Well , Tobey ! Up with you . You 've got to go to bed . p. 54 TOBEY ( As they disappear into the hallway ) Willie , what 's the Rubicon ? WILLIE Right through here  --  ( The lights dim down on stoop and come up in IDA 'S room . LEAH has knocked on IDA 'S door . IDA , crossing her parlor , lets LEAH in . She greets her warmly ) IDA Come ! Leah darling ! I was beginning to get worried there was an accident with the streetcar . LEAH Oh , no . Everything was fine . ( Looks around ) What a beautiful tenement ! IDA That 's your room , and there 's the piazza . ( Points ) There from the piazza you can see the whole world . LEAH ( Goes out on the piazza and looks down the street . As she comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IDA Tobey ? LEAH Yes . IDA So if you met Tobey you met Willie Lavin . If Tobey were Willie 's own son he could n't take more care . And how did you like Willie ? LEAH He 's a darling ! IDA ( As a brilliant idea strikes her ) He 's very educated from the chemistry . To meet Willie Lavin that 's a good start . I want you should have a good time in Worcester . You want perhaps to lie down for a nap after your trip ? p. 55 LEAH ( Has decided to take the plunge ) Before I do anything  --  I want to talk to you about about IDA About the furrier from Atlanta . LEAH ( Faces her , prepared to speak the truth ) Yes . I do . ( She sits on the sofa ) IDA ( Sits beside her ) So we 'll talk . But first , Leah darling , I owe you an apology . LEAH Why ? IDA Because about that furrier from Atlanta I found out such things that I apologize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LEAH ( Feels greatly relieved ) Really ? IDA ( Squaring off ) It 's a miracle I found out in time . It 's like a special delivery from God . LEAH What did you find out ? IDA In the first place I met somebody who knows him close and his face is with pimples . In the photograph you ca n't see because the photographer took them all out with an eraser . This is right away dishonest . In his leg he has a vein . And , over and above , he 's not even a furrier . What he sells is from cats . So now the mayor of Atlanta is after him with a subpoena . p. 56 LEAH ( Happy to be absolved , playing along ) Then how can I face him when he comes tomorrow ? IDA ( By this time she firmly believes everything she is saying ; her eyes flash with righteous indignation ) You think I would let a no-good low-life that steals cats set foot in this house ? Today I sent him a telegram he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry out for joy ) To tell you the truth , I 'm relieved . IDA Relieved is nothing . You are salvaged ! LEAH I do want to get married . But somehow  --  I want IDA You 'll get ! LEAH ( Smiles at her ) Let 's hope . IDA Take my word . LEAH Ida  --  it just occurred to me now that the furrier is not coming , there 's no reason really for me to stay here . IDA Stay you will for the company . Here are people coming and going . In the afternoon we go to Easton 's Drug Store  --  five o'clock it 's full of prospects with milk shakes . Already you met Willie Lavin . I bet he right away melted. p. 57 LEAH ( Laughs , picks up suitcase ) Well , all right , if you 'll put up with me . IDA ( Opens bedroom door for LEAH ) In here is your room .

WILLIE ( Teasing her ) What about the furrier from Atlanta ? IDA She do n't like his picture . Already she sent a telegram to the furrier he should stay where he is ! WILLIE Well , I 'm glad that 's disposed of . ( A moment ; he does n't have to help out LEAH now ) I think I 'll go home and do some work . ( He starts toward door . IDA , in a panic that he will leave without seeing LEAH , grabs him by the arm ) p. 58 IDA Leah darling . Willie Lavin is here !

Ida did it all . I ca n't tell you what a relief it is not to be a bride ! ( An awkward pause , as she sits on the sofa ) You know , I 've never slept away from home before in my whole life . WILLIE ( Sitting beside her ) Really ? LEAH It 's a strange experience . I 'm so excited I do n't see how I ever will fall asleep tonight . WILLIE Under other circumstances I would take you to White City . That 's what we call our Amusement Park on the Lake . There 's dancing .

( DAN waves to MYRA and disappears up the hill . MYRA leans over her balcony for a moment ) MYRA Willie  --  Willie  --  ( On hearing MYRA 'S voice , WILLIE dashes across the room , out on the piazza , and looks up at MYRA ) WILLIE Excuse me , Miss Long Myra MYRA Who 're you with ? Who 're you talking to ? WILLIE Ida 's house guest . A Miss Long . MYRA Oh , Willie , I 'm sad . I 'm lonely . p. 60 WILLIE Where 's Dan ? MYRA He got tired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . WILLIE Be right there ! ( He has forgotten all about LEAH  --  remembers her only when he sees her as he runs back into the room from the piazza ) Oh , excuse me , Miss Long ! ( Lamely ) It 's an old friend of mine who lives upstairs ( He runs out . LEAH looks after him a moment , then she goes out to the piazza and leans over the rail to peer out into the darkness to catch a glimpse of the siren . When LEAH comes back into the room , her expression is wistful . She feels very lonely suddenly . She calls out ) LEAH Ida ! Ida ! ( IDA bustles in ) IDA Where 's Willie ? LEAH A friend of his called him from upstairs . He went up to talk to her . IDA Myra ? LEAH Yes . That 's her name . Myra . I could n't see in the dark . Is she attractive ? IDA ( With contempt ) She 's thin and she giggles . LEAH Well , I guess she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow morning . ( IDA comes to LEAH full of sympathy and understanding , and comforts her ) @x Two years later . At rise , TOBEY and MR . SACHER are in IDA 'S parlor . MR . SACHER Well , Tobey , I have to be getting back to the grocery ! ( Sighs ) Though why I do n't know . TOBEY Is business bad ? MR . SACHER It 's not flourishing ! Well , there 's one consolation , Tobey , in running an unsuccessful grocery . You can eat the inventory . TOBEY Ida is very kind to us  --  having us to meals and everything  --  but I miss Mother . I dream at night that she is alive  --  then I wake up . MR . SACHER I know , Tobey . So do I. TOBEY ( Under great strain ) Father ! MR . SACHER Yes , Tobey . TOBEY There 's something I 've got to tell you ! MR . SACHER What is it , Tobey ? TOBEY I 've done a terrible thing  --  a crime  --  MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I broke my glasses again last week . MR . SACHER Did you ? You did n't tell me . TOBEY I was ashamed to tell you . I 've broken them so often . I know things are not easy for you  --  and it 's fifty cents a lens . MR . SACHER How did you get the money to replace them ? TOBEY That 's what 's so terrible . I stole it . MR . SACHER From the till ? TOBEY No . I would n't do that ! MR . SACHER How then ? TOBEY The Sweet Caporal packs from your shelves . MR . SACHER Oh  --  you sold the cigarettes ? TOBEY No , Father . The pictures . You know they have those pictures inside . Prize fighters like Bob Fitzsimmons and Jim Corbett . Allie Seidenberg is collecting the prize fighters . He needed Joe Choynski desperately . He offered me one dollar for Joe Choynski . MR . SACHER A dollar for Joe Choynski ? TOBEY So  --  I  --  MR . SACHER Yes , Tobey ? TOBEY I ripped open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MR . SACHER Prize fighters ? Why is trained violence so idealized ? Why do n't they put pictures in the cigarette packs of the philosophers : Spinoza , Descartes , Maimonides ? TOBEY I guess they 're not so well known , Father . I 'm sorry , Father . I felt I had to tell you . MR . SACHER ( Absently ) Thou shalt not steal . TOBEY I 'll never do it again , Father . MR . SACHER It would have been better if you 'd asked me for money , Tobey . Cheaper , too . ( He starts to go . WILLIE comes in . He has just come from MYRA 'S upstairs ) WILLIE It 's not to be believed what I hear . MR . SACHER What do you hear ? WILLIE The minute Dan died you all began to back Aaron 's claim to marry Myra . And you justify it by invoking a dead law . MR . SACHER Why do you accuse me ? WILLIE I 've just left Myra 's mother . She says you approve of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harangues Mr. SACHER through TOBEY ) Imagine , Tobey , you live in a community where they marry girls off by medieval rites . Now , in Worcester , Massachusetts in nineteen ten . p. 65 MR . SACHER Now , Willie  --  I hate to contradict a scientist because naturally scientists know everything , but you 're wrong about this law . It 's not medieval . It 's Biblical . WILLIE Even remoter . MR . SACHER You 'll find it in the book of Ruth . I looked at it just this morning . ( He quotes ) " Moreover Ruth the Moabitess have I purchased to be my wife that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren , and from the gate of his place . " WILLIE Exactly . Purchased . It was a real estate deal then . It 's a real estate deal now . MR . SACHER You simplify too much . There is a deeper reality behind it ; a desire for immortality . Do n't you see what threatens Mr. Eisner ? That his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate of his place . WILLIE It is brutal of Mr. Eisner to gratify his desire for immortality at Myra 's expense . I 'm studying law now and I 've gone into this thing . Actually this law gives Myra the right to accept Aaron or refuse him . She has the right . MR . SACHER That is so . But why are you so impassioned about this , Willie ? Let Myra do what she wants . WILLIE Two years ago you stopped me from telling Myra the truth about Dan . With what result ? Suffering and early widowhood for Myra. p. 66 MR . SACHER I ask you now what I asked you then  --  what is the motive behind your crusade ? WILLIE All right . It 's selfish . I love Myra . I intend to marry Myra . Had I behaved selfishly two years ago I 'd have saved Myra from a horror that has left its mark . Good would have come from an impure motive . Your rigid code has resulted in disaster . MR . SACHER ( With humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WILLIE I 'll see that she does ! MR . SACHER Willie  --  Willie  --  you 've thrown over chemistry  --  now you 're studying law  --  you change your profession over night . But about Myra you 're steadfast . I wish it were the other way round . ( A moment ) Well , I 've got to get back to the grocery . Tobey , I am disturbed by what you told me . I thought I was selling cigarettes . I did n't know I was selling prize fighters . ( He goes out ) TOBEY ( To WILLIE ) Father 's so impractical . He does n't know his own stock . WILLIE Tobey . I 'm all worked up . Let 's go for a walk . TOBEY Love to ! ( IDA comes in from the kitchen ) p. 67 WILLIE ( With affectionate reproach ) You too , Ida . You too . IDA I too what ? WILLIE Myra 's mother tells me you 're on her side . ( Goes to her , pinches her cheek ) You too invoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know nothing . I go by what is good for you , Willie , and to get Myra safely settled with Aaron would be a load off . Aaron I hope is healthy enough to stay for a while . WILLIE ( Laughs to TOBEY ) No getting around Ida , Tobey . She pursues an objective with the tenacity of a  --  with the tenacity of a  --  ( Hung up ) Of a what , Tobey ? TOBEY With tenacity . WILLIE You see ! ( They go out through the kitchen as MANDEL , the landlord , knocks loudly and comes in . He is in smart riding costume : boots , whipcord breeches . He wears a carnation in the lapel of his tweed jacket , and carries a riding crop which he swishes occasionally , with nonchalance . IDA is in a fluster at seeing MANDEL ) IDA Mandel ! What a happy surprise ! NORBERT MANDEL Mrs. Feinberg . ( IDA stares in admiration at MANDEL , taking in every detail of his bizarre costume ) p. 68 IDA Tell me , Mandel , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Going . IDA It is a pleasure to look on you , Mandel . You smell from solid leather ! NORBERT MANDEL ( Formally ) Thank you for the compliment , Mrs. Feinberg . IDA So tell me , with this suit where are you going ? NORBERT MANDEL Sundays is usual with me horseback . Sundays I canter . I am a habitue . IDA ( Stares at him , rapt ) A peace on you , Mandel ! NORBERT MANDEL Thank you for the thought , but peace I do n't want . Peace I 'll have in my grave . Norbert Mandel wants action ! ( He swishes his riding crop , by way of action ) IDA ( Drinking him in with adoration ) A long life to you , Mandel ! NORBERT MANDEL ( With restraint ) Thank you , Mrs. Feinberg . Does Miss Long happen to be home ? IDA No . Leah went out . NORBERT MANDEL That 's too bad because now I have an appointment with my groom . p. 69 IDA Before the groom let me give you a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but before a canter I never eat . IDA But , Mandel ! Why are you so formal ? In the letter you wrote me from Revere Beach you call me Ida dear . NORBERT MANDEL ( Swishing idly ) In all the world  --  yes , I think I can say it Mrs. Feinberg  --  in all the world there is no woman I hold in the high regards I hold you . IDA So what interrupts ? NORBERT MANDEL ( Enjoys a Byronic melancholy  --  rotates his riding crop slowly ) My experience of life has been so sad , dear friend . My wife  --  may-she-rest-in-peace  --  the good Lord took away . So I have decided from henceforth to concentrate on riding , hunting and real estate developments . IDA You are a young man yet  --  in the prime . NORBERT MANDEL Norbert Mandel is old through suffering . IDA Mandel  --  listen to me  --  NORBERT MANDEL ( Very cagey ) Yes , dear one ? IDA I have decided I would like , for a change , to be a private woman ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matchmaking ! You would n't . It 's in your blood . IDA You should get married , Mandel  --  even if it 's not me ! NORBERT MANDEL Is this your true opinion ? IDA Whose true opinion is n't it ? NORBERT MANDEL Then I must tell you of a strange development that has developed lately in my psychology . IDA What development ? NORBERT MANDEL I am attracted , Mrs. Feinberg . IDA ( Dashed but game ) By whom are you attracted ? NORBERT MANDEL ( Takes the plunge ) Your lodger  --  Miss Long . IDA ( Flabbergasted ) Leah ! NORBERT MANDEL Yes . IDA But Leah is a young girl  --  a child ! NORBERT MANDEL But did n't you just admit that I am in the prime ? IDA ( With some heat ) Even for the prime Leah is too young . Leah is in the beginning . Besides  --  for Leah I am already arranging . p. 71 NORBERT MANDEL ( Hard ) The fact is , Mrs. Feinberg IDA So what is the fact ? NORBERT MANDEL ( Tensely  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact is that in Norbert Mandel your lodger arouses the flame . IDA At our age let me tell you from the shoulder , Mandel , marriage is no flame . NORBERT MANDEL ( Swishes , flamelike ) For less Norbert Mandel will not settle ! IDA ( Fighting a losing action ) At our age a good marriage is to have steam heat in winter and an icebox in the summer . ( LEAH comes in ; she is surprised to see MANDEL ) LEAH Oh , Mr. Mandel . How are you ? NORBERT MANDEL Happy to see you , Miss Long . LEAH ( To IDA ) I just bumped into Willie Lavin and Tobey . Willie asked me to White City tonight . IDA ( Rises . Gives MANDEL a meaningful look ) You see , Mandel ! A fine canter to you , Mandel . NORBERT MANDEL Thank you , Mrs. Feinberg . ( IDA goes out into the kitchen . For a few moments there is an awkward silence between LEAH and MANDEL . Finally  --  ) Do you ride horseback , Miss Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's not for the likes of me , Mr. Mandel . I 'm a working girl . NORBERT MANDEL I have kept you under my eye for some time , Miss Long . LEAH ( Surprised ) Have you ? NORBERT MANDEL You are a bright girl . Give you the opportunity you could shine in a bigger world than Providence Street . LEAH But I 'm not ambitious to . I like Providence Street . Providence Street has been very good to me ! ( A moment ) And now  --  if you 'll excuse me , I 'm afraid I 'll have to ( She starts toward the door of her room ) NORBERT MANDEL ( Takes her arm as she starts to go ) May I ask you something , Miss Long  --  something personal ? LEAH Certainly . NORBERT MANDEL May I ask how it happens  --  a lovely person like you  --  how it happens you are not married ? LEAH ( Smiles at him ) That is very simple to answer , Mr. Mandel . No one has ever asked me . NORBERT MANDEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You are an honest soul , Miss Long  --  a very unusual soul . p. 73 LEAH ( Embarrassed ) Well  --  thank you . ( She starts to go again , but he holds her ) NORBERT MANDEL ( Very tense ) No one , you say , has ever asked you ? LEAH That 's right . NORBERT MANDEL I ASK YOU , MISS LONG ! LEAH ( Startled ) Surely , Mr. Mandel  --  you 're not serious NORBERT MANDEL ( Still holding her arm ) Norbert Mandel was never so serious in his life ! I am in the prime of life , Miss Long LEAH Congratulations ! NORBERT MANDEL I am able to satisfy your heart 's desire  --  every which way . Give me yes and in a week you are living like a queen . You will find out that Norbert Mandel is a man of action . He do n't let the grass grow . LEAH ( Rises ) It is only fair to tell you  --  I am in love . NORBERT MANDEL Willie Lavin ? ( Cruel , inexorable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taking her own revenge ) In any case , I could never marry you . NORBERT MANDEL And why not ? Do you intend , perhaps , to remain an old maid ? LEAH Rather than marry you  --  yes ! ( On the verge of tears she runs into her room . Mr. MANDEL is dumfounded , furious . He swishes his riding crop savagely . With his free hand he twirls his mustache in anger ) NORBERT MANDEL ( Suddenly calling out in a voice of thunder ) MRS . FEINBERG ! ( IDA comes in ) IDA What 's the matter ? The house caught fire ? NORBERT MANDEL I AM ON FIRE , Mrs. FEINBERG ! IDA From the flame ? NORBERT MANDEL Yes , the FLAME . I am in the prime and in the prime the flame burns hotter than in the beginning ! IDA So what do you want I should do ? NORBERT MANDEL Arrange for me with Leah Long , and Norbert Mandel will never forget you ! IDA It 's a funny way , Mandel , to preserve me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Feinberg , I can tell you in confidence  --  recently I took out a big policy with the Prudential Insurance Company . IDA You 're sick , Mandel ? NORBERT MANDEL Norbert Mandel was never in better health in his life . But get me yes from Miss Long and overnight she becomes the beneficiary . On my policies with the Prudential Insurance Company is featured a big rock . Norbert Mandel is like that rock . Stable . Gilt-edged . Pass that to Miss Long ; she should know on which side is the butter . IDA I 'll pass . NORBERT MANDEL Good day , Mrs. Feinberg ! ( He goes ) LEAH ( After he goes , from her room ) Has he gone ? IDA Gone he has . And , Leah , you should know if the worst , God forbid , comes to the worst , you have in reserve a BIG ROCK ! ( The lights dim out and come up on the stoop . We see MYRA on the piazza , looking anxiously up and down the street . We see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stoop ) WILLIE Hello , Mr. Mandel . NORBERT MANDEL Hello , hello . ( He goes quickly up the hill ) p. 76 MYRA Willie ! I 've been waiting for you ! WILLIE I 'll be right up . MYRA No . I 'll come down . Mother 's nagging the life out of me . I 'll be there in a moment . TOBEY Willie ? WILLIE Yes . TOBEY Before you go on this big fight , your object is to marry Myra . Right ? WILLIE ( Humoring him ) That is the dazzling objective  --  yes . TOBEY Do n't you think then , that the first thing you should do is to find out how Myra feels ? Ought n't that to be the first step ? WILLIE ( With the same tone of raillery ) My impetuosity is so great that I 'm taking the second step first . TOBEY ( Knows he is being chaffed ) Seriously , Willie ! WILLIE Seriously  --  Myra or no Myra  --  I 've got to upset the CONCEPT  --  the concept of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a storm ) Applause from Heaven ! ( He sits on the bench ) TOBEY ( Sitting beside him ) I love before a storm . Willie , I want to tell you something : when I play the piano  --  Schubert and Chopin  --  p. 77 WILLIE Well ? TOBEY I think of Leah . The music 's like Leah . WILLIE I see what you mean , Tobey . Leah 's a wonderful girl . Loyal , self-reliant  --  TOBEY Is n't that a lot ? WILLIE There 's no mystery in Leah  --  in Myra there 's mystery . TOBEY What 's mysterious about Myra ? WILLIE That 's part of the chemistry of sex . Unexplainable . TOBEY Spontaneous combustion ? WILLIE That 's right . TOBEY ( Shyly ) If I were older , Willie  --  WILLIE Yes , Tobey ? TOBEY Well , I 'd get more combustion out of Leah . I think about her at night . WILLIE Do you ? It used to be the Dark Angel and holding on to the bedposts . TOBEY I 've forgotten about them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOBEY It 's troublesome too . ( A moment ) I just do n't understand , Willie , why you do n't love Leah. p. 78 WILLIE Neither do I , Tobey ! TOBEY If things do n't turn out  --  between you and Myra  --  will you turn to Leah ? WILLIE Things must turn out for me and Myra . TOBEY One reason I love Leah is because she thinks you 're wonderful . And when I talk to Myra about you  --  WILLIE Yes ? TOBEY We always end up talking about Myra . ( MYRA appears on the stoop ) MYRA Hello , Tobey . WILLIE Well , go on up and practice your piece . ( TOBEY reluctantly goes ) Where do you want to go ? MYRA Anywhere ( It begins to rain hard . Thunder and lightning . She shrinks against him for protection ) Oh , Willie . I just ca n't stand the thunder . It frightens me so ! WILLIE ( Holds her to him , adoring it ) It is n't the thunder that 's dangerous  --  it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's over . It 's just a summer shower ( There is another great thunderclap . She buries her face against the lapel of his coat , stopping her ears with her hands ) p. 79 MYRA Oh , Willie  --  I 'm so scared ! WILLIE ( Holding her ) You were afraid of thunder . Since you were a little girl . ( A sudden lightning flash illuminates the stoop ) MYRA ( Removes her hands from her ears ) Is it over ? WILLIE Over . Now it 's just the rain . Remember that awful thunderstorm  --  when we were out canoeing  --  a few years ago . Remember how scared you were ! And you lived through it , did n't you ? MYRA I remember every thunderstorm . Ever since I was a kid  --  they drove me crazy with fear . WILLIE I paddled to shore  --  we turned the canoe over  --  and lay under it  --  remember ? Remember the noise the rain made on the canoe bottom  --  like bullets ? MYRA I remember how wonderful it was when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  lying close to you . MYRA ( A little calmer now ; there is the sound of steady rain ) I know it 's silly . Why is it ? Why am I so scared ? WILLIE ( Cracks his knuckles ) I venture to say that if you analyzed it to its source you 'd find some deep psychic p. 80 MYRA ( Interrupts him ) Willie , why do you crack your knuckles like that ? You 're always doing it . Why ? WILLIE ( Turning it off adroitly ) Perhaps for the same reason you 're afraid of thunder . ( They both laugh a little ) MYRA ( Sitting on the bench ) Ever since Dan died  --  everything scares me even more . And now this with Aaron  --  and he 's coming here any minute . WILLIE ( Sitting beside her ) Why should you throw yourself away on somebody you do n't love like Aaron ? MYRA When it comes to that , I 'd rather marry you than marry Aaron . WILLIE That 's cold comfort ! MYRA ( A moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you go ? MYRA New York . I love New York . When I was there with Dan I met the manager of the Hotel Astor . Imagine  --  the manager ! WILLIE Did he fall in love with you too ? MYRA Oh , no . He 's fat and old and has hundreds of children . But Dan fell ill  --  and this manager was so very kind . He said : if you want a job in New York , let me know . ( We hear TOBEY playing Chopin ) p. 81 WILLIE But , Myra , I 've waited for you . MYRA I know . I used to think  --  during that dreadful time  --  Willie loves me  --  Willie 's waiting for me . WILLIE Did you , darling ? Did you know ? MYRA Of course I knew , and it consoled me . I thought  --  he 's waiting  --  and I 'm waiting . WILLIE For me ? Were you waiting for me ? MYRA I 'm always waiting for a promise . That no one made me but which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling that there is  --  there must be  --  love  --  which will make life  --  which will somehow make life WILLIE ( Suddenly miserable ) I think I know what you mean . MYRA But with the promise I 'm afraid of the future too  --  as if it were thunder . WILLIE I 'll protect you from the thunder , Myra . MYRA Come closer to me . Talk to me , Willie . Tell me your innermost thoughts . ( He obeys her . He is tongue-tied , in an ecstasy of love ) Say something to me  --  something soothing like the rain . WILLIE I love you . I 've never loved anyone else . I never will love anyone else . p. 82 MYRA How can you tell that ? WILLIE I know it . MYRA What about Leah ? WILLIE Leah 's not you ! No one in the whole world is you . MYRA Are you going to marry Leah ? WILLIE How can I when it 's you I love ? MYRA Willie  --  Willie darling  --  WILLIE ( Downcast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love you . But shall I tell you something ? Do n't wait for me . Love me . Do n't forget me ever . But do n't wait for me . WILLIE No matter what you say , I 'll wait for you . Always . MYRA I hate this mourning dress . Do n't look at it . I feel that I 'm pretending more than I feel when I wear mourning for Dan . I hate mourning like I hate the dark . I love light . I love bright colors . Oh , I 'd love to be gay for you , Willie . WILLIE Be gay . Go up and change your dress . MYRA Oh , I 'd be afraid to . WILLIE Do n't be . Go up and change . MYRA I will . Why ? should n't I ? I will . ( She goes in . AARON enters from the right , holding an umbrella . He is sullen and attempts to brush by WILLIE without speaking to him . WILLIE seizes his arm , holds him ) p. 83 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously . AARON I do n't want to talk to you . I dislike you . WILLIE I know that and I understand it . But I think for both our sakes we should declare an armistice and have a council of war . AARON What are you driving at ? WILLIE Our tactics with Myra . I think they are wrong . AARON I have no tactics . My case is clear . WILLIE It may be clear but it has one defect . Myra does n't consider you have a case at all . Do n't you see , Aaron , we 've both made a serious mistake . We have to change our whole plan of attack . AARON Why do you say we ? I 'm marrying Myra . You 're not . WILLIE She 'll marry neither of us if we do n't change our tactics . You are basing your whole claim on this old law . I am basing mine on demolishing the law . We are both misguided , Aaron , and do you know why ? Because Myra is lawless . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to drop our present campaign  --  regroup our forces  --  we  --  AARON Stop saying we ! Stop saying our ! This is n't a joint enterprise ! WILLIE It is a joint enterprise until one of us eliminates the other . ( MYRA comes back in a yellow dress . AARON is horrified ) p. 84 MYRA Oh , Aaron . AARON ( In a terrible voice ) What are you doing in that dress ? MYRA Why I just  --  Willie said I could stop mourning for an hour  --  AARON My brother is hardly in his grave and you  --  you put on this dress to tempt Willie . You 're a harlot ! WILLIE Tactics , Aaron  --  tactics ! AARON You leave Myra alone . WILLIE I will when she asks me . AARON I 'm Dan 's younger brother . I have the right . She 's mine by law . Get out ! MYRA I never loved you , Aaron . And now I do n't even like you any more . I do n't care about the law . AARON Put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out before I ( There is a tremendous thunderclap . In terror , MYRA clings to WILLIE ) MYRA Willie  --  do n't leave me  --  do n't leave me with him  --  WILLIE Do n't worry , darling . I wo n't leave you . AARON ( His voice drops , menacing and quiet ) You 'll pay for this  --  both of you . And I 'm going up now to tell your mother ! ( He goes into the house ) p. 85 MYRA ( Whispers to WILLIE ) Willie  --  I 'm scared  --  WILLIE ( Masterfully ) Do n't worry He 's like the thunder , darling  --  noisy but not dangerous . MYRA You are the only one who loves me  --  Do n't leave me  --  please , darling , do n't leave me . WILLIE ( Quietly , happy , holding her in his arms , kissing her hair ) Never , Myra . Never , my love . I 'll never leave you . ( As he caresses her hair , the sound of the rain fades and we hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 86 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO MR . SACHER 'S ROOM , late afternoon the next day . The parlor reveals a Rembrandtesque scene of FATHER and his fellow scholars at their annual session , celebrating the finishing of the reading of one of the books of the Talmud : the great , calf-bound volumes are propped up before each of the students , who are all men of FATHER 'S age , or older : in their ordinary lives grocers , peddlers , petty artisans , tailors , but now , transmuted in their absorption , figures from a medieval print , with their skull caps , sober garments and absolute absorption , poring over the parchment-like pages . A cadenced warm hum comes from them : intermittent little flares of subdued argument in crises of interpretation ; silence , then the hum again  --  it is a sound , not articulate speech . A Menorah , with lighted candles , furnishes the only  --  flickering  --  illumination . TOBEY is sitting on the stoop , his head buried in a book . We hear WILLIE 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes down the hill  --  the first notes of Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony . WILLIE Hello , Tobey . What are you up to ? TOBEY Well , I thought of going to the lake with Allie and the boys as soon as my father gets through up there . p. 87 WILLIE Oh , the annual session . TOBEY Does it take them a whole year to go through one of those Talmud books , Willie ? WILLIE Well , they can only devote part time to it . TOBEY What 's in them anyway ? WILLIE ( Sitting beside him ) The Talmud ? A code of law and behavior  --  interpretation . Some of it 's very funny . TOBEY Really ? I never see my father or his friends laugh . WILLIE Well , it 's a serious business for them . For instance , there is a speculation : Why did God make Eve out of Adam 's rib ? Well , the Talmud suggests if he 'd made her out of his hand she 'd be grasping ; if he 'd made her out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used his eyes she 'd be overcurious . In addition , God wanted Eve to be modest . So he used the rib because it was invisible . So , he stuck to this neutral material , the rib , with the result that she is now grasping , gossipy , incessantly curious and of disturbing visibility . TOBEY ( Laughing ) I wish those books were in English . I 'd love to read them . WILLIE You do n't have time  --  not till you 've finished that piece you 're working on  --  Opus One . p. 88 TOBEY Opus One . I 'll never finish it . I knew I 'd never be a great pianist , Willie . Now I guess I 'll never be a composer either . WILLIE Stick to it . It 'll come . TOBEY Are you free tonight ? WILLIE No . I 've got a date with Myra . TOBEY Everybody says Myra 's given up Aaron for you . WILLIE So far , she 's only given up Aaron . TOBEY Will she take you then ? WILLIE That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary faculty . TOBEY What 's that ? WILLIE She has the faculty of accepting you and rejecting you simultaneously . ( Meanwhile , in the parlor there is a small final crisis of interpretation ; the hum stops suddenly . Everyone 's attention focuses on FATHER ; obviously they look to him as the most learned , to bring them out of their dilemma . Complete silence . FATHER leans forward in concentration , his finger on the disputed passage . He repeats , reading the elusive sentence  --  first with one emphasis , then again with another , an entirely different emphasis . There is a sudden illumination among them ; the difference in emphasis has dispelled the ambiguity , the meaning is now clear , irrefutable , to all of them . A great sigh of relief rises from the embattled table and then a kind of muted acclamation to FATHER . Laughter . Jubilation . They shut their books ; they are like schoolboys released from an onerous task . Several of the men shake hands with FATHER , congratulating him . MR . SACHER goes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SACHER Tobey  --  we 're finished  --  come up  --  the tea and cakes  --  Tobey . IDA ( Comes out on the piazza . She sees WILLIE and TOBEY and Mr. SACHER ) You heard the news ? Your hitzel-dritzel , Myra . WILLIE ( Apprehensive ) What happened ? IDA She flew away the coop ! WILLIE What do you mean ? IDA She ran away . A note she left that she 'll write a note . So why did n't she write it now ? For you too she left a note . WILLIE Where is it ? ( WILLIE starts up toward her ) IDA For the note you do n't have to run because I read it ! WILLIE You had no right to do that ! IDA You , too , she tells when she gets settled she 'll send you a note . What I have with Myra 's mother I ca n't tell you . Dead Myra is n't I tell her . Better she should be dead she says . WILLIE I knew this would happen ! IDA ( Matter-of-factly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop ? p. 90 WILLIE You 've driven her out , all of you . The loveliest thing in this God-obsessed community  --  you 've driven her out ! MR . SACHER No one forced Myra to go WILLIE ( In despair  --  really to himself ) All the bickering . All the wrangling . That fanatical father of Aaron 's  --  Aaron himself . MR . SACHER ( Gently ) You are not fanatical , Willie . Could you keep her ? WILLIE I 'll go to New York . She asked me never to leave her . MR . SACHER So then she promptly left you . WILLIE ( As he goes up the hill ) I knew this would happen . I knew this would happen . TOBEY ( Starting after him , stops ) Willie ! Do you want me to come with you ? Willie ! MR . SACHER He needs solitude , Tobey . It 's no reflection on you . He 's had a terrible blow . IDA No . It 's a good blow . This blow will stop him from chasing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for him Myra is no good . Now , I can arrange for him nice with Leah . ( She goes back into her house ) p. 91 TOBEY Father . MR . SACHER Yes , Tobey . TOBEY Did you love Mother the way Willie loves Myra ? MR . SACHER You do n't love like that when you 're older . TOBEY But you did love Mother ? MR . SACHER Yes . I loved her very much . TOBEY Still you quarreled . I used to hear you quarreling . Mother never said anything . But your voice would go up  --  up  --  MR . SACHER ( This makes him suffer ) I am a sinful man , Tobey . TOBEY You pray all the time . You think about God all the time . That 's why I could never understand about those quarrels . MR . SACHER I suffer now over those quarrels . ( He stops , tries to explain ) Look , Tobey , your mother lived in a silent world . She had been in this country as long as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a student when I married her  --  had never left our village . And then I went away to study more  --  in France and Germany  --  and when I came back  --  TOBEY Yes ? MR . SACHER Your mother was still a village girl . And I was arrogant and impatient ! I wish that I could have  --  But it 's too late now . p. 92 TOBEY Father , do you think Willie will get over this ? MR . SACHER That 's a question I ca n't answer , Tobey . When I see the troubles of the young , it 's a positive relief to be old . TOBEY Father  --  is it possible , Father , to be in love without being unhappy ? MR . SACHER It 's possible , but highly unlikely . ( He motions to TOBEY to come with him . They go into the house ) The Lights Dim Out p. 93 Act 2 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE At IDA 'S , a month later . There is a dress form with an attractive summer dress on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the piazza , surveying the passing scene . From the SACHERS ' flat , we hear TOBEY struggling with a composition of his own : Opus One . We hear ALLIE SEIDENBERG whistling for REN . REN turns her back on him disdainfully , and comes into the room . IDA ( From the kitchen ) Who is whistling ? REN ( With contempt ) Allie Seidenberg is whistling . IDA So why do n't you ask him to come up ? REN Because he disgusts me , that 's why ! IDA Allie 's father is a very fine man . REN His son is n't . He has a dirty mind . ( IDA enters from the kitchen , dressed to the nines in the style of Providence Street , 1910 ) IDA ( Shocked ) Things like that you should n't say ! REN ( Very haughty ) In school the other day he asked me what I was reading . I said , " The Lay of the Last Minstrel , " and he made an offensive remark . I did n't even know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how do you know it was n't nice ? REN ( Very lofty , very elegant ) By the tone ! IDA ( Putting on a large hat , an odd confection which blooms with cherries and other fruit ) You like my hat , Ren ? REN It 's beautiful ! ( They listen for a moment to a crescendo in TOBEY 'S composition ) IDA That 's Tobey practicing . You hear , Ren ? REN Oh , Ma , when are we moving to New York ? I 'm just stifled here . IDA When your grandfather 's second wife dies  --  may she live to be a hundred and twenty  --  but she wo n't  --  she has a lung  --  then I 'll ( WILLIE comes in . He employs his usual tone of jocular levity with IDA but he is under a cloud ) Oh , Willie , life ! WILLIE Why , Ida , you 're dressed up like Queen Victoria . Where are you going ? IDA Tonight I have with the Ladies Burial Improvement Society . It 's too late I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So where are you going ? WILLIE I have a date with Leah . We 're going to White City . p. 95 IDA For a month already since Myra left you have dates with Leah , but where is the result ? ( The sound of shrill whistle from the street . REN runs out to piazza . IDA explains to WILLIE ) Day and night they whistle for Ren . WILLIE Love call ! ( REN comes back and makes for the door ) IDA Who is it ? REN Allie ! ( IDA is a bit surprised at REN 'S quick conversion . WILLIE listens to TOBEY playing upstairs ) WILLIE ( Impressed ) Say ! Tobey 's made progress . IDA ( Points to the dress form ) Look that dress Leah designed . Filene 's in Boston want Leah should be a buyer . WILLIE ( Abstracted ) I should n't wonder . Leah is clever . IDA Moreandover  --  from Field Marshall in Chicago you heard ? A store he has in Chicago they say bigger than Filene 's . To him Leah sent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview . From a good family he is that Field Marshall  --  so latch on quick to Leah before he sees her . p. 96 WILLIE ( Smiles at her ) I adore Leah and it seems selfish somehow to interfere with such a brilliant match ! IDA Yesterday Norbert Mandel came to see me . WILLIE Congratulations ! IDA Do n't scramble me up in my meaning . About Leah he came to see me . An expression from Florida he told me  --  Leah should fish or cut the bait . And to you too I tell the same thing , Willie  --  you should n't cut fish with Leah either . WILLIE Ida , darling , you 're scrambling me up a bit  --  with your meaning . IDA What I mean you know . WILLIE I guess I do . IDA Did you hear , Willie  --  so crazy he is for Leah , Norbert Mandel , that last Sunday he fell off his horse ! WILLIE I hope he recovered . IDA From the horse he recovered but from Leah he did n't recover ! WILLIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know perfectly well that Leah is far too nice a girl to take the august Mr. Mandel away from you . It would n't be ethical . IDA In this department I have news . For Leah too . Something important : TO NORBERT MANDEL I HAVE GROWN COOL ! So now for Leah with Norbert is ethical . p. 97 WILLIE But Ida ! You astonish me . How can you fall in and out of love like that ? You 're volatile . You 're capricious . IDA Do n't bamble me with those high-tone words . This I tell you , Willie . Educated you are . Bright you 're not ! WILLIE Never was truer word spoken . IDA From that Myra you 're still looning ? On me her mother cries all the time . In the hotel in New York where she spent her honeymoon half-undressed she 's selling cigarettes . In the same hotel where she spent her honeymoon ! Another hotel she could n't find ! About you , Willie , everybody on the hill is asking questions . WILLIE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he 's good with the chemistry . Why does he all of a sudden switch to study for a lawyer ? WILLIE Because I want to know for a lawyer . IDA Willie , I have loved you all your life  --  what is with you ? WILLIE The surface is smooth . The interior 's a bit untidy . IDA So everything tell to Leah . She 'll fix . WILLIE I wonder . IDA If you wo n't tell Leah , at least tell me  --  in plain language . p. 98 WILLIE The fact is , dear Ida , I am afflicted by a syndrome of perplexities . A syndrome , dear Ida  --  IDA Syndrome  --  pindrome , you 've got to live ! WILLIE That , darling , is the heart of my problem ! ( LEAH comes in from her room . LEAH and WILLIE greet each other warmly but with constraint ) LEAH Oh , hello , Willie . WILLIE Hello , Leah . IDA ( Pointedly ) Leah , Mandel was here . He plasters me where are you ? LEAH ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you heard , Leah ? Ida has grown cool to Norbert Mandel ! IDA Me with Mandel is a romantic dream . WILLIE What 's wrong with a romantic dream ? IDA It 's no good in the daytime ! And I tell you this Willie You should stop cutting fish . And I tell both of you , it 's a sin to live alone . ( She goes out . LEAH and WILLIE look at each other , smiling ) WILLIE To be anchored to the bread and wine of life like Ida  --  to the near horizons  --  how enviable ! Have you noticed ? With Ida everything is factual  --  serious  --  a Heaven and Earth bounded by marriage . p. 99 LEAH ( Lightly ) Well , what are Heaven and Earth bounded by ? ( She is conscious that this may sound like a lead , changes the subject quickly ) Have you heard from Myra ? WILLIE Once . LEAH In a whole month ? WILLIE Well , she 's very excited about being in New York . She 's angling for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she works . LEAH Myra is so  --  seductive . Something wonderful 's bound to happen to Myra . WILLIE I hope so . ( Probing into his own mind , determined to be truthful ) I hope so  --  and I do n't hope so . LEAH What do you mean ? WILLIE I love Myra . And yet , way down deep in my heart , I want her not to succeed  --  in whatever she 's after  --  so that I 'll have a chance . Egotism . Selfish egotism . LEAH ( After a moment ) Willie ? WILLIE Yes , Leah ? LEAH I am going to ask you something dreadful . WILLIE You may ask me anything you like . p. 100 LEAH Did you have an affair with Myra ? WILLIE No . She would n't . She says if she 'd sleep with me  --  she 'd marry me . She 's got something special about that . It was dreadful that way  --  I mean her experience with Dan  --  on their honeymoon I gather it was something she wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful I 'm relieved to hear you did n't have an affair with Myra . I was sure you did . I was jealous over that , terribly jealous . How 's that for selfish egotism ? WILLIE You are a very fine person , Leah , I mean  --  to be so frank with me  --  to tell me about it LEAH Well  --  so did you ! So you are a very nice person also ! ( WILLIE looks at her , troubled . LEAH has lost self-control , she pushes on , savage ) That 's what you are and that 's what I am  --  what is Myra ? ( She is obeying compulsively a masochistic impulse ) WILLIE ( Disconcerted ) What is Myra ? Gosh , Leah , I do n't know . It 's like asking to describe a scent  --  an aroma . It 's a kind of magic  --  a kind of LEAH ( Inexorable ) Well , what ? p. 101 WILLIE She will say to you  --  she 's so eager  --  she 's so eager for sympathy , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? WILLIE She 'll say , " Shall I tell you something , Willie ? " She 's always saying that . It draws you into a kind of conspiracy with her , a cozy isolation , a secret shared only with her  --  from all the world LEAH Do n't you imagine she says it to everybody ? WILLIE Of course . But that does n't matter . But when she says it to you , then you 're alone in the world with her . ( He is abashed at having said so much . Rises ) I do n't know what it is , Leah  --  but you make me talk a lot of nonsense ! Let 's drop all this . Let 's go to White City ! LEAH I do n't think I feel like going any more . WILLIE Oh , come on now , Leah  --  you ca n't go back on me like that  --  we have a date . ( There is a moment of awkward silence between them . From upstairs we hear TOBEY practicing Opus One ) LEAH It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that piano . WILLIE That 's his own piece . I have an intuition about Tobey  --  that one day he 'll do something . Tobey 's creative . I 'll study  --  he 'll know . ( A pause ) It 's only fair to tell you , Leah , I 'm going to New York , for good . ( The music fades out ) p. 102 LEAH When ? WILLIE Tomorrow . I have a feeling that Myra will one day come to a place where she 'll need me  --  when that moment comes I must be there . LEAH There 'll be other men in Myra 's life . You know that . I know that . You 'll wait  --  you 'll wait  --  for the parade to pass . WILLIE Myra 's vulnerable . LEAH She does what she likes . She takes what she likes . What 's vulnerable about Myra ? ( She gets up and faces him . Passionately  --  she is not in control of herself ) Shall I tell you something , Willie ? I 'm glad you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each other since Myra left . I look forward to the evenings when I have dates with you  --  but I dread them too . We talk . We make conversation . But with Myra at the back of your mind every second , it 's an agony for me . I want no more of it . When Myra ran away I was happy , I thought  --  there , I 'm rid of her . But I 'm not . She 's here . I 'm not rid of her . I 'll never be rid of her . If I felt there was any future in Myra for you I 'd  --  I 'd  --  WILLIE ( Comes close to her ) Leah  --  dearest Leah  --  LEAH Do n't come near me ! I wish Myra were dead ! p. 103 WILLIE ( Whispers to her ) Leah . Sweet Leah . I adore you . I love you . Darling Leah LEAH She does n't love you  --  but I do . That 's why she wo n't sleep with you , because she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He kisses her . The kiss becomes long and passionate ) The Lights Dim Out p. 104 Act 2 , Scene 4 SCENE FOUR Several days later . The lights go up on Mr. SACHER 'S room . TOBEY is curled up reading . From the next room we hear Mr. SACHER 'S nighttime prayer . MR . SACHER " May the angel Michael be at my right hand , Gabriel at my left " TOBEY ( Looks up from his book , calls ) Father ! Father ! MR . SACHER ( Comes in ) Yes , Tobey . What is it ? TOBEY Those four angels you 're always praying to  --  MR . SACHER Well ? TOBEY Why do n't they do more ? MR . SACHER They do the best they can ! TOBEY They could n't save Mother . Is it because they 're good that they ca n't do more ? MR . SACHER The good are not without power , Tobey . Their very existence is a power . ( We see WILLIE coming up the street with his suitcase ) Otherwise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly give those good angels a hard time ! ( WILLIE reaches the stoop and whistles his Beethoven signal . TOBEY jumps up and goes to the door ) p. 105 MR . SACHER Here comes the oracle  --  turn over your questions to him . ( WILLIE comes into the room ) TOBEY Hello , Willie . You going someplace ? WILLIE New York . TOBEY When ? WILLIE ( Puts suitcase down ) Tonight . I know it 's late , Mr. Sacher . I just had to say good-bye to Tobey . MR . SACHER How long are you going for , Willie ? WILLIE For good , I hope . MR . SACHER What about your job here ? WILLIE I 'll get a better one in New York . MR . SACHER Yes ? WILLIE I 've got plans for Tobey too . I know he wants to be a composer . When he gets through school I want him to join me in New York . That 's where the opportunity is . MR . SACHER Your plans are far-ranging , Willie . Now what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not sudden . I 've been planning this for some time . MR . SACHER Myra ? WILLIE I 've had a telegram from her . She needs me. p. 106 MR . SACHER So this is your objective ? WILLIE What 's wrong with that ? MR . SACHER It is n't enough . WILLIE My other objectives are boundless . MR . SACHER That 's too much . WILLIE ( Teasing , with humor ) Not for me . I 'm insatiable . I 'm going to cross all frontiers , master all the disciplines , then come back here and emancipate you . MR . SACHER Oh , Willie , you wo n't be able to emancipate anybody until you 've disciplined yourself . WILLIE ( In mock despair ) I 'm afraid my mission will fail . You live in a closed world . MR . SACHER And you live in a limitless one . WILLIE It gives me more room . MR . SACHER You joke , but that is your danger  --  too much room . Because there must be limits  --  that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are limits for you are chains for me . MR . SACHER Words . Words . Admit it , Willie  --  you 're chasing Myra . She does n't love you . She 'll never love you . Why do n't you declare a loss and turn to someone else ? p. 107 WILLIE Because I 'm afraid of bankruptcy . I ca n't expect you to understand what I feel for Myra . Myra 's installed inside me , independent of me , feeding upon me , but it has nothing to do with Myra really . MR . SACHER Evidently you prefer mystery to light  --  the riddle to the answer . And all your gifts will go for nothing . ( WILLIE turns away ) I 'm concerned about you , Willie . You run a grave risk . WILLIE ( Turns back ) Life is a risk . Life is a danger . I 'm not lucky the way you are  --  to be securely locked in a cell of faith . I would n't exchange my danger for all your security . MR . SACHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life may be pedestrian , but they are unalterable . You charge at them , but they will resist your charge , and you will come out the loser Good-bye , Willie WILLIE ( As he grabs his suitcase and runs out ) I 'll write you , Tobey ! ( The lights dim down to come up on the stoop ) TOBEY ( Following WILLIE to the stoop ) Willie ! Willie ! ( WILLIE stops ) Willie , you 're terribly angry with Father , are n't you ? p. 108 WILLIE Yes . I am . TOBEY Why ? WILLIE Because he told the truth . TOBEY Then why are you going ? WILLIE Because I must . TOBEY I see you must . WILLIE Whatever it is ahead of me I 've got to meet it  --  I 've got to meet it head on . TOBEY Have you told Leah ? WILLIE Yes . It 's too late now , Tobey . ( A moment . He consciously lightens the mood ) New York is n't Europe after all . You 'll write . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A pause . He reaches out his hand to TOBEY . They shake hands like two men ) So long , Tobey . TOBEY ( Fighting tears ) So long , Willie . WILLIE Work hard . Keep well . TOBEY You too , Willie . WILLIE ( Starts up the hill , stops ) Finish Opus One . TOBEY I will . I 'll finish it . ( WILLIE goes quickly ) @x New York City , five years later . The set consists of IDA 'S living room , stage right ; and TOBEY 'S and WILLIE 'S garret-living room , stage left . IDA 'S flat is directly across the hall from her father 's on West Eighty-sixth Street . A few pieces from Providence Street have been moved here . Prominently placed is the imposing , large photograph of her father , the Ramov . The lights come up on TOBEY 'S and WILLIE 'S flat , which is in Morningside Heights . On the easel of a cheap upright piano are TOBEY 'S music-manuscript papers . Nearby is a bridge table , with a green-shaded light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Every once in a while he experiments with a dissonant phrase on the piano , which he can do without moving from the table . He is in a profound concentration . The piece on which he is working is as far removed as possible in spirit from the melodious and pensive Chopin which we heard him play in Act Two . His own composition is jagged , dissonant , very modern . When the telephone rings , TOBEY answers it . It is IDA , from the living room of her flat . As he reaches the phone and picks up the receiver , we light up on IDA 'S flat . TOBEY Hello . p. 110 IDA ( On the telephone ) Hello it 's you , Tobey ? TOBEY Yes . How are you , Ida ? IDA Fine . But this is not why I called you . Willie is there ? TOBEY Not just now . I know he has a date with Myra . IDA So why is he chasing with that Myra when she is crazy in love with another man ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it hard to pin Willie down these days  --  a bit like trying to put mist in a bottle . IDA But this is not why I called you . Why I called you is to tell you Leah is back from Chicago . TOBEY Oh , that 's nice . How is she ? IDA Wonderful . A wonderful job she has on Fourteenth Street . With me she is staying till she finds an apartment . The baby she adapted is here too . Wait till you see him , Tobey , you 'll right away melt . What I want you should come to dinner and Willie he should come too . TOBEY With Myra ? IDA Better without . But if I have to I have to . Leah is crazy to see you , Tobey , so come right away . Come quick . TOBEY O.K. ( She hangs up . We see TOBEY hang up . He is smiling . He picks up his manuscript , looks at it , throws it down with a kind of disgust  --  then he picks up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dims down on TOBEY 'S apartment . Just as IDA leaves the telephone in her apartment it rings again . IDA turns to answer it ) p. 111 IDA ( On phone ) So who are you ? Oh , Mrs. Grodberg from Fourteen F Tell me , Mrs. Grodberg , do I know you ? At my stepmother 's funeral was the whole city of New York so I 'm sorry I do n't remember you , Mrs. Grodberg To my father you want an introduction ? Tell me , Mrs. Grodberg , are you healthy ? ( REN comes in , now an attractive young Miss . She listens to her mother with some impatience ) Are you pious ? I had in mind a Boston woman with whom my father could live out his life well , promises I ca n't make , Mrs. Grodberg , but I will keep you in mind Yes , yes , I will mention to Poppa ( Kindly ) On pins and needles you should n't be sitting because a long time you may be sitting So good-bye , Mrs. Grodberg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmed by her responsibilities ) Till I find for Poppa I wo n't have a moment 's peace ! REN Is Myra coming for dinner ? IDA Maybe . That hitzel-dritzel is always with a maybe . REN ( Swooning over MYRA ) She 's so glamorous . Was n't she beautiful in the show ? IDA Beautiful she was , but so undressed I thought any minute they would turn the shower bath on her . What do you think , Ren ? From Mandel I had a ring . p. 112 REN Congratulations ! Are you engaged ? IDA On the telephone . He 's coming . REN You 're so busy marrying off other people you do n't notice anything about me . I am going through a crisis . I 'm crazy about this boy I met , a French major at Columbia . IDA So bring him . REN He keeps putting me off . He prefers common girls . IDA A Frenchman ! What do you expect ? REN Oh , Ma , you 're hopeless . IDA Do n't worry , darling , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The time is now , Ma ! IDA Now is the time I wish you would go in the kitchen and peel some onions . REN ( With disdain ) Onions ! ( The doorbell rings . IDA gets up ) IDA So here is Mandel . ( She goes out to the hallway . REN looks at herself in the mirror , does something to her hair ) REN ( Bitterly ) Onions ! ( But she yields to the exigencies of existence and goes into the kitchen . IDA comes in with MANDEL , MANDEL is tanned almost to blackness . He wears a sharkskin suit and twirls a cane ) p. 113 IDA ( Palpitating in spite of herself ) A joy it is to see you , Mandel ! NORBERT MANDEL ( Very formal ) Did you receive my communication from Florida ? IDA I received but I did not answer because I was cool to you . Now I see you I tell you the truth my heart jumps . How can this be when I am cool ? ( MANDEL twirls his ginger-colored mustache  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stares at him with rapt admiration ) Tell me , Mandel . This color you are all over ? NORBERT MANDEL ( With great delicacy ) With certain considerations , Mrs. Feinberg . I understand Miss Long is now back from Chicago and residing on these premises . IDA She is . NORBERT MANDEL I told you years ago Norbert Mandel has great willpower . He never gives up . IDA So what do n't he give up ? NORBERT MANDEL Leah from Fitchburg . That 's what he do n't give up . IDA Leah put out of your mind . NORBERT MANDEL Norbert Mandel is faithful ! Norbert Mandel is steadfast ! He do n't switch ! p. 114 IDA With Leah you do n't fit , Mandel . ( He walks away , swinging his cane debonairly . He abandons Romeo , becomes Machiavelli . IDA watches him , fascinated ) NORBERT MANDEL ( Twirling his cane in large circles ) While she was in Chicago I understand Leah took it into her head to adapt a baby . IDA So what has that ? NORBERT MANDEL A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young girl to do . ( LEAH comes in . She is older , but very handsome , assured and smart ) LEAH ( Breathless ) Oh , Ida , I 'm so lucky . I 've found a lovely apartment right  --  ( Sees MANDEL ) Oh , Mr. Mandel . NORBERT MANDEL ( All charm ) Why so formal ? After the length of our acquaintanceship you are surely justified in calling me Norbert . IDA ( Helping as far as she can ) Yes , Leah . Call him Norbert . You 'll feel closer . LEAH I 've got quite a lot on my mind . IDA So how long does it take to call him Norbert ? p. 115 NORBERT MANDEL ( To LEAH ) You are starting in , I understand , as buyer in a dress shop on Fourteenth Street . LEAH Yes . I am . NORBERT MANDEL Should be with luck . LEAH Thank you . NORBERT MANDEL In Boston I have just acquired an important situation where I plan to put up a superior market . LEAH I 'm glad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid you 'll have to excuse me . I want to look in on my baby . NORBERT MANDEL ( Flushes ) Norbert Mandel is not used to being cut off in the middle . ( A moment . He glares ) Norbert Mandel is a busy man ! ( Looks at his watch ) In a half-hour I have with a syndicate . ( He is simmering with fury . He moves to the door ) Norbert Mandel knows when he is not welcome . ( A moment ; revengeful ) And how is your baby , Miss Long ? LEAH Very well , thank you . NORBERT MANDEL Norbert Mandel likes children , Miss Long . Maybe it is better for the baby you should the sooner the better be Mrs. Long . ( At this IDA 'S eyes flash ) p. 116 IDA ( Rises ) Mandel  --  what are you grabbling ? NORBERT MANDEL I think Miss Long knows . IDA Listen to me , Mandel ! Cool I was to you already . Now I am frozen ! NORBERT MANDEL ( Drops IDA , addresses LEAH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lays his heart  --  baby or no baby . Should you care to communicate with me I am in Rooms Two thirty-four , Two thirty-five in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Thirty-fourth Street and Fifth Avenue . IDA ( In spite of herself this tidbit fascinates her ) Two rooms you have , Mandel ! NORBERT MANDEL Yes . Norbert Mandel always takes two rooms . One is for sitting . IDA Mandel , you should not come here again . Go to your rooms and sit in both of them . NORBERT MANDEL ( Appeals to IDA with great sincerity ) Mrs. Feinberg  --  tell her . What I feel for Miss Long is the kind of occurrence that occurs once in a lifetime . ( His voice rises ) I am enamored . Deeply enamored . IDA You hear , Leah , what he is ? p. 117 NORBERT MANDEL I want her to do me the honor to be my bride . ( He faces LEAH . He suddenly loses all his bravado . He has the courage , facing defeat , to reveal it as a faade ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But my heart is in the right place . Miss Long , with you I could become refined . With you I could become educated . Please , Miss Long . LEAH ( Touched ) I 'm sorry , Norbert  --  I 'm very sorry . NORBERT MANDEL This is the last appeal of Norbert Mandel . What are you now ? A buyer with an adapted baby that 's not adapted . ( He goes out . IDA 'S eyes blaze . She turns to LEAH ) IDA That he should let a thing like that drop from his mouth  --  never again will I arrange for Mandel ! LEAH ( Quietly ) It 's true though , Ida . IDA To such slanders you should n't even listen ! LEAH ( Very moved by IDA 'S faith ) But I am telling you , Ida . IDA ( Overcome with shock ) Oh , I forgot . You I have to believe . LEAH I lied to you five years ago about my reason for going to Chicago . I was afraid it would be a shock to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock if you did it ? LEAH I went there  --  and got a job there  --  to have my baby . IDA ( Grasping at a straw ) So it must be you 're married ? LEAH No , Ida , I 'm not married . IDA ( Still struggling with the horrendous fact ) But , Leah treasure ! If you had a baby  --  even if all by yourself  --  he must have a father ! ( Looks up at her ) So who is the father ? LEAH Willie Lavin . IDA ( Gets up indignantly ) Willie Lavin ! This from Willie Lavin I would n't believe . LEAH ( Smiles faintly ) I had more to do with it than he did . Do n't blame him ! He was perfectly honest . He was always crazy about Myra . He never pretended . IDA But why did n't he tell me ? LEAH Because he does n't know . That 's why I went to Chicago in the first place . Because I did n't want him to know . IDA He must right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't know and I do n't want him to know and I trust you not to tell him . p. 119 IDA But for the baby it 's no good . Not to have even a father ! LEAH I 've been through all that . I had a terrible struggle about that . It 's all I 'll ever have of Willie 's and I wanted it  --  because I wanted Willie . IDA ( Bewildered , it is too much for her ) But , Leah angel , do n't you want to get married ? LEAH Not in the least . IDA ( Her universe overturned ) A wonderful girl like you should be an old maid ! LEAH ( Smiles ) Well , not quite . IDA When you wrote me you adapted a baby , I said to myself , " How can you take in your house a perfect stranger ? " Now I see he was n't such a stranger ! LEAH That 's right  --  he 's no stranger . IDA ( Moved ) The poor little orphan . LEAH ( Laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ida . I 'm very much alive ! ( Stops a moment at the door ) I can trust you , ca n't I ? Not to tell anybody  --  nobody in the whole world . p. 120 IDA Who should I tell ? ( Thinks a moment ) I think I 'll call up Mandel and invite him to dinner . LEAH What for ? IDA Now that I know it 's true what he said I want to tell him he 's a liar . LEAH ( Laughs ) Oh , Ida ! ( She blows IDA a kiss and goes inside . IDA is in a daze . She sits , fans herself with the edge of her kitchen apron . REN comes in from the kitchen ) REN I ca n't cope with any more onions , Ma . Let me arrange the flowers on the dining-room table . IDA ( Sits , overcome by her worry . To get rid of REN  --  ) Arrange ! Arrange ! REN What 's the matter , Ma ? IDA Everything ! ( Catches herself ) I mean nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picks up the receiver ) Hello  --  the number you have right but the exchange is not right , so who are you ?  --  It 's too bad , Mr. Brown , you have a wrong number , but anyway call me later because now I 'm busy . Glad to have met you , Mr. Brown . ( She hangs up and sits on the chair ) p. 121 REN Ma ! It was a wrong number ! Why did you ask him to call back ? IDA A nice voice he had , very educated , and he sounded lonely . REN Oh , Ma ! ( She goes out to the dining room as TOBEY comes in ) TOBEY Hello , Ida . IDA ( Absently , without looking at him , her mind awhirl ) Oh , come in Tobey life . ( She rises ) TOBEY ( Kisses her on the check ) How are you , Ida ? IDA This do n't ask me . TOBEY What 's wrong ? IDA ( Sitting on sofa ) This do n't ask me either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to talk . To you I have to tell a secret . But first you must promise me  --  by your **28;2448;TOOLONG you must promise me  --  that what I 'm telling you wo n't tell a living soul . TOBEY ( Sits beside her ) I promise . IDA You heard that in Chicago Leah adapted a baby ? p. 122 TOBEY Yes . I did . IDA She did n't adapt . She had . TOBEY ( This is a surprise ) Are you sure ? IDA More sure I could n't be ! But I have your promise , Tobey  --  not to tell anybody in the whole world . TOBEY ( Sincerely ) Of course you have ! IDA ( Abruptly ) Except Willie Lavin ! Him you can tell ! ( As he looks at her , he rises slowly , comprehension of the truth and of the meaning of her maneuver breaking in on him ) The Lights Dim Out p. 123 Act 3 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO At TOBEY 'S . The next evening . WILLIE is pacing in their room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live up to his responsibilities . WILLIE Hello , Tobey . TOBEY I 'm glad I found you . I want to talk to you . I waited up for you last night . WILLIE I was with Myra . But I 've been waiting for you too , Tobey . I have something I want to speak to you about . TOBEY Look , Willie , sit down . WILLIE ( Cuts in , does n't sit , picks up TOBEY 'S score ) How 's it going ? ( TOBEY makes a gesture of disgust at his manuscript ) Heard yet from that fellow you submitted your piece to ? TOBEY George Slocum . I 've been expecting a call all day but I have n't heard from him , probably never will . What the hell ever made me think I was a composer anyway ? ( Sitting on piano stool ) But that 's not what I want to talk to you about . WILLIE ( Cutting in again ) Congratulate me . I passed my bar exams . TOBEY Congratulations . But I 'm not surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . p. 124 WILLIE But , Tobey , I want to ask you a favor . TOBEY What ? WILLIE I want to go back to Worcester . I want you to come with me . TOBEY What for ? WILLIE Impulse to revisit the scenes of our youth . Think things over . Get back to first principles . I 've come to a kind of conclusion , Tobey  --  it 'll probably seem strange to you . I passed the bar exam with flying colors , but the thought of practicing law revolts me . Now for the first time I feel I know what I want to do . TOBEY Now listen to me , Willie . WILLIE ( Sitting on the bed ) Here 's the thing . I 'm sick of the endless revolutions of my thoughts . I 'm sick of pondering the mysteries that are insoluble . Everything is a question , everything is a dilemma . I long , Tobey , for the simple , the finite , the concrete . TOBEY That 's wonderful . I 'm happy to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to talk to you about . WILLIE ( Presses on . Passes his hand over his forehead ) I do n't sleep , you know , Tobey . I want to forget everything I 've ever studied , ever thought . I want to go back to Worcester  --  get a job . p. 125 TOBEY You better listen to me , Willie , before you fly off on another tangent . WILLIE No . But this is sound . No tangent . I want to go back and take a job in a factory . I want to do a job that requires no thought , tending a machine . I want to be tired at the end of the day , Tobey  --  spent  --  so tired that I 'll fall into dreamless sleep . Will you know me in overalls , Tobey ? TOBEY ( Deeply disturbed . A moment ) Willie I 've got to have your attention about something vital . WILLIE Oh , by the way , Myra wants to have dinner with us . TOBEY Has n't she gone to California yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIE She does n't project , it seems . That director she 's in love with is n't taking her . All her hopes have vanished to such a degree that she wants to marry me . TOBEY ( Thinks he sees it now ) Will Myra consent to be the wife of a factory hand ? I ca n't quite see her in that role . WILLIE If I married her now it would be out of pity and she deserves better than that . The truth is I do n't want to marry Myra. p. 126 TOBEY I do n't believe that . WILLIE Myra does n't either . You know , Tobey , I 've lived so long with this obsession for Myra that without it  --  I 'd feel  --  unemployed . TOBEY Willie , now for God 's sake listen to me . If you really want the finite , the concrete , you do n't have to go to a factory in Worcester . Because they 're all right here for you . WILLIE How ? TOBEY You have a responsibility here  --  to Leah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source ? TOBEY ( Rises ) God damn it ! Why do you talk about ultimate responsibility when you have an immediate one ? Leah 's adopted child is your child . WILLIE ( After a moment ) That possibility has occurred to me , you know . TOBEY It has ? WILLIE But I preferred to accept Leah 's fiction . TOBEY Well , now you know it is n't fiction . It 's a fact . A fact which you must face . WILLIE ( Suddenly docile , goes dead ) Tobey  --  the True Name of the Lord your father used to forbid you to seek . Do you remember ? p. 127 TOBEY Yes . But what has that got to do with what we 're talking about ? WILLIE ( Sitting on bed ) I used to think there was only one mystery , the key to everything , and you 'd get it all in one blinding flash  --  TOBEY Willie  --  please  --  WILLIE ( In a spiral of amused speculation ) No , Tobey , no , it 's just an amusing idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me  --  the heart of the mystery , the mystery that is the core of everything  --  supposing by some lucky chance I did hit on it  --  probed it  --  supposing it turned out , this terrible secret , to be quite simple really  --  even a bore ? ( TOBEY is staring at him in desperation , in agony , in despair ) I think that 's funny . I thought it would amuse you . I see it does n't . TOBEY ( Sitting on the stool ) No , it does n't amuse me . WILLIE What were you saying , Tobey , what were you telling me ? TOBEY I was telling you about Leah . WILLIE I think about Leah  --  the suffering she must have gone through . TOBEY ( Jumps up , cutting him off ) Listen , Willie . I owe you more than I can ever possibly repay : you made me see life as a wonder and as an adventure . I owe you everything  --  even the truth . And the truth is that you have wasted yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remember your arguments with my father . He was right  --  all the way . You feel this need for the concrete , so you turn to manual labor , which will probably bore you to death after one week . Another horizon , another mirage , another postponement . Chemistry . Law . What you know , what you have , you turn your back on . It is the unknowable that lures you . Even my talent is an unknown quantity and you made a concept out of that . Willie , the near things , the achievable things , the warm winds of affection , of friendship , of love , do n't seem to touch you any more . ( A pause ) p. 128 WILLIE You 're right . I 'm destructive to people  --  Leah  --  even Myra . I waited for Dan to die . He was my friend . When he died I could n't repress a feeling of exaltation . Ethically speaking , I am a murderer . TOBEY Concepts again ! That 's distortion . ( Sitting beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own life in this world . Attach yourself to something definite  --  with all the problems that go with it  --  Leah  --  your child  --  you could do for him what you 've done for me . WILLIE You 're right about everything . The pupil has outstripped the master . In the kid is wisdom . Tell me what to do , Tobey , and I 'll do it . TOBEY I do n't have to tell you . You know what to do . WILLIE I 'll go to Leah and ask her to marry me . ( A pause ) But what about Myra ? She 's coming here . TOBEY ( Rises ) I 'll take care of Myra . I 'll take her to dinner . WILLIE Call me from the restaurant . TOBEY But you 'll be proposing to Leah . WILLIE ( Rises ) Then call me. p. 129 TOBEY What for ? WILLIE Just call me . TOBEY If you like . WILLIE I 'll be waiting for your call . ( WILLIE goes . TOBEY stares after him . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory . He begins to pace the room , in unconcious imitation of his father  --  his hands behind his back . Out of a deep well of memory he begins to pray  --  as his father used to pray ) TOBEY " At my right the angel Michael , at my left Gabriel , and over my head the Divine Presence of God " The Lights Dim Out p. 130 Act 3 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE At IDA 'S . The action follows the preceding scene at WILLIE 'S . The doorbell rings . LEAH goes to open it , admitting WILLIE . LEAH ( Very surprised , even a bit aghast . They stand face to face for a moment ) Willie ! Did you come to see me or Ida ? WILLIE I came to see you . LEAH ( Does n't believe it ) Well , Ida 's gone out . WILLIE ( After an awkward pause ) Felt like seeing you . LEAH Well  --  thank you . ( Another awkward pause ) WILLIE ( Points to her dress ) Pretty dress , Leah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked off my own racks on Fourteenth Street . ( A moment ) Like a drink ? WILLIE No , thanks . ( Another pause ) LEAH Well  --  sit down  --  relax . Working for the bar exams , I hear . WILLIE Just passed them . ( A moment . She looks at him ; she is mystified by his visit . He starts walking around the room , suddenly wheels around , shoots the question at her ) How would you like to be a lawyer 's wife , Leah ? p. 131 LEAH ( A moment , lightly ) Are you proposing to me ? WILLIE ( Meets her look ) Yes . LEAH ( It flashes through her mind that he has heard about the paternity of the baby ) Why ? WILLIE I 've been thinking about you  --  and I want to . LEAH What about Myra ? WILLIE Myra 's out of my life . LEAH ( Smiles at him ) Is that why you 're proposing to me ? Is Myra getting married ? WILLIE Not as far as I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( LEAH moves at once to the little bar , fixes two drinks and hands one to him . WILLIE takes the drink and lifts the glass in a toast to her ) Cheers ! LEAH ( Touches her glass to his ) Cheers ! WILLIE To our future . ( She laughs ) What 's the joke ? LEAH What a funny man you are ! p. 132 WILLIE ( Bleakly . Puts his glass down on bar ) I can be funny on occasion . ( A moment . She keeps studying him ) LEAH You know , I suppose , that I 've adopted a baby . WILLIE Yes . Ida told me . LEAH ( Points to bedroom ) He 's asleep . In there . Would you like a look at him ? WILLIE No thanks . LEAH I know ! Other people 's babies are always a bore . WILLIE But you have n't answered my question . LEAH What ? WILLIE How you would like to be a lawyer 's wife . LEAH And you have n't answered mine . WILLIE What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on you again . So you come in here and ask me to marry you . ( Moves away from him ) Well , I wo n't . I do n't want to marry you . Nor anybody . WILLIE It seems unfair to yourself . LEAH You must understand my position . WILLIE I understand . You do n't love me any more . p. 133 LEAH ( In a low voice ) I do though . I 'll never love anybody else . WILLIE Then why ? LEAH I could n't marry you because I do n't think I could stand the perpetual threat of Myra . WILLIE ( With anger ) It 's all over  --  I 've told you  --  between Myra and me . Over ! LEAH I 'd hate to put you to the test ! WILLIE ( His voice rises ) THEN STOP DOING IT ! I 've just been telling Tobey  --  Myra means nothing to me ! LEAH I wonder . WILLIE ( Begins to lose control of himself ) I BEG YOU , LEAH  --  DO N'T CROSS EXAMINE ME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ida told you something more . ( She waits . He says nothing . He sits on the hassock ) I asked her not to . ( He is still silent . LEAH knows now ) So that 's why you 're here ! To make an honest woman out of me ! Good , moral boy from Worcester ! WILLIE ( In manic fury ) You drive me crazy . Stop analyzing . I want you to marry me . I have the right to marry you . CA N'T YOU JUST ACCEPT THE FACT ? I love you . I admire you . ( Rises ) Is n't that enough for you ? Have a heart , Leah ! Give me a chance , ca n't you ! ( Sitting on sofa ) You do n't risk anything . p. 134 LEAH ( Turns to him . Her voice rises ) I risk this hold Myra has over you ! WILLIE Do n't keep flinging Myra at me . It 's broken I tell you . How many times do I have to tell you ? There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody . Nor for herself . Shall I tell you why ? She 's in pursuit of a romantic ideal . She 'll pursue it endlessly . It will elude her endlessly . LEAH ( Beginning to be persuaded ) It 's taken you a long time to find this out about Myra . WILLIE No . I always knew it . LEAH ( Passionately ) Then why , Willie why have you let it drag on so long ? WILLIE ( Quiets down , very clever , aware that he is pouring the word into an ear less subtle than his own ) What I have felt for Myra was an obsession . Nothing more . What I feel for you  --  what I have always felt for you  --  is real . ( This does it . This persuades her . She goes to him , overcome with compassion and love for him ) LEAH ( Kneeling beside him ) Willie ! Willie ! ( She embraces him . A silence . Quietly  --  ) In my heart I have always been married to you . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all right , darling . ( With a little laugh ) I accept you . I had n't realized it was possible . LEAH What ? WILLIE It 's odd , with you I feel peace  --  security  --  a kind of peace . ( There is a long silence . She kneels beside him , holding his hand on the arm of the sofa ) LEAH ( Very moved ) I can hardly believe it  --  I can hardly  --  oh , Willie , Willie , Willie  --  after all we 've been through ! WILLIE It 's settled , is n't it , Leah , between us , the two of us  --  we 're committed to each other , are n't we ? ( The outside door is heard closing . IDA comes in ) IDA Did I stay away long enough ? LEAH ( Gets up , smiles at her ) Yes , you did , Ida . Just long enough . WILLIE There 's no doubt about it , Ida  --  when you die , there will be joy in Heaven among all the unmarried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there should be joy on earth among all the unmarried angels . ( Hugs WILLIE ) With you , Willie , such a slow poke you are I began to give up hope . p. 136 WILLIE ( Infuriated with his own bravura . Sits on sofa ) Slow poke . Admitted . But you , Ida , you marry people off by instinct . You rush them to the altar . You seem unaware of the immense responsibility . For a girl like Leah the alternatives are endless . How can you settle on me ? Think of it , Ida  --  consummation ! ( He rises ) " For as long as you both shall live . " For eternity ! That 's a long time , darling . Who knows what lurks in the distance  --  for Leah ? For me ? What angers , what bitterness , accidents , disaster , deathknell sounding through the wedding bells ! IDA Wedding bells you and Leah do n't need . They 'll wake up the baby ! ( To LEAH ) You told him yet that he 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up now to break the news to him . ( LEAH starts out ; WILLIE starts to follow . She stops at the door , kisses WILLIE , faces him toward IDA ) I 'll tell it to him gently . ( She goes ) IDA Willie darling , so long I waited to see this day I thought it would never come . WILLIE ( After a pause ) Perhaps it 's come too late , darling . IDA What too late ? p. 137 WILLIE Too late for the near horizons  --  I abdicate ! IDA What are you talking ? WILLIE ( His exuberance gone  --  tender , and with abdication ) Ida . Ida . Ida . ( He sinks into the sofa ) IDA ( Rises , going to him ) Willie ! Willie ! ( The telephone rings ) WILLIE That 's Tobey . IDA ( Rises ) So ask him to come over  --  so we can tell the good news  --  ( By this time WILLIE is on the phone ) WILLIE Tobey where are you ? At the restaurant ? You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! Oh , Tobey , that 's great ! I 'll meet you at the apartment I 'll tell you later , Tobey Good-bye , Tobey . ( He hangs up . Goes to IDA ) Tobey 's having his first performance . Is n't that wonderful ! I feel as happy about this as you do , Ida , when you pull off a match . It 's a funny thing , Ida , that the only responsibility I have ever recognized is my responsibility to Tobey . He 's grown-up  --  surpassed me , as I knew he would . But my faith in Tobey and what he might do that was tangible  --  that was real  --  and not as Tobey thinks  --  a concept Goodbye I love you  --  ( He starts out ) p. 138 IDA What are you rushing ? WILLIE ( Comes back ) I want you to give Tobey a message for me . IDA But I just heard you  --  you 're going to see Tobey . WILLIE In case I miss him , Ida  --  in case I miss him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stands silent , as if he had n't heard her . To rouse him out of his trance , frightened  --  ) Willie life  --  look at me  --  what should I tell Tobey ? WILLIE Tell him ! IDA So ? WILLIE Tell him he 's right about the factory in Worcester  --  instead tell him I 'm going to stop holding on to the bedposts . Can you remember that ? Good-bye . I love you . ( He rushes out ) IDA Willie ! Willie ! ( IDA starts for the bedroom , then runs to the telephone ) Central , get me Schuyler nine-seven-four . ( The lights come up in TOBEY 'S apartment . TOBEY comes into his room as the telephone rings ) TOBEY ( Sitting on bed , picks up the receiver ) Hello . p. 139 IDA Hello , Tobey . TOBEY Ida , where 's Willie ? I ca n't wait to talk to him about my concert ! IDA Tobey , from Willie I 'm worried  --  all settled he is with Leah and all of a sudden  --  TOBEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's all right . We arranged it that way  --  IDA All right it is n't . TOBEY Why ? IDA He said good-bye to me as if he was saying good-bye Go down stairs to the sidewalk  --  wait for him , Tobey  --  grab him , Tobey ! TOBEY All right . IDA Something else he told me to tell you , Tobey . Crazy it sounded  --  He said I should tell you that no longer he 's holding on to the bedposts . ( TOBEY 'S hand holding the receiver goes limp . It falls to his lap ) What does he mean ? Tobey ( As she gets no answer she jiggles the phone in terror ) Tobey ! Tobey ! Tobey ! The Lights Dim Out p. 140 Act 3 , Scene 4 SCENE FOUR Back in Worcester . The street leading to JIM 'S office . We hear the oboe : JIM is playing the melody from Handel 's Water Music , as at the beginning of the play . Summer twilight . TOBEY is walking to JIM 'S office  --  as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOBEY 'S walk is slow , dejected . He pushes the bell button . We light up on JIM 'S office , unchanged , and see JIM putting down his oboe , as we saw him do earlier when he admitted TOBEY and WILLIE . JIM NIGHTINGALE Well , Tobey ! I 've been expecting you ! How are you ? ( They shake hands ) TOBEY Just about as low as you can get . Felt I had to come back here . I wanted to revisit the scenes where Willie and I were happy  --  when we did n't know what was ahead of us  --  doom for Willie  --  despair for me . JIM NIGHTINGALE Now , Tobey ! Tobey , pessimism is easy . Despair is a luxury you ca n't afford . Sit down . ( He points to the sofa ) TOBEY Same old sofa . JIM NIGHTINGALE Naturally . TOBEY Still a symbol of conquest ? p. 141 JIM NIGHTINGALE Alas , only a symbol . The sofa is willing , but the flesh is weak . TOBEY Jim  --  ( He sits on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Tobey . TOBEY Willie  --  ( But he ca n't . His head sinks in his hands and he shakes it in misery ) No use . I ca n't . JIM NIGHTINGALE Look , Tobey . You could have done nothing for Willie , I assure you . TOBEY He asked me to come here with him . Maybe if I had come  --  JIM NIGHTINGALE It would have done no good . Willie was without an anchor  --  the anchor of reality . He could n't face the everyday responsibilities of a permanent attachment  --  not only to a woman but to a job . TOBEY ( With bitter self-reproach ) And yet  --  the last time I saw him  --  I pushed him into reality . JIM NIGHTINGALE It had nothing to do with you . Suicide , you know , is self-criticism in its most acute form . TOBEY ( Gets up , starts to walk the room , flailing in self-abasement ) The worst of it is  --  do you know why I did n't come with him when he asked me ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited over the performance of a piece I 'd written . JIM NIGHTINGALE How did it go , the concert ? TOBEY Disaster . JIM NIGHTINGALE Did n't anybody care for it . TOBEY A few fanatics for modern music like myself . One critic  --  JIM NIGHTINGALE ( Rises ) Wonderful ! One whole critic ! TOBEY You should have seen the others ! I am a failure as an artist . A failure as a friend . JIM NIGHTINGALE You ca n't be a failure at your age . It takes much longer to achieve solid failure . You 're lucky to get your first failure over with so early . The sooner to get to your second ! TOBEY But this is it , Jim  --  half the time it 's not Willie I 'm thinking of , it 's that damned concert ! ( Summing it up ) Look , Jim  --  it is a world without Willie , and still the ego twitches . JIM NIGHTINGALE Thank God . Once the ego stops twitching not even a great doctor like myself can do anything ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 143 JIM NIGHTINGALE Come back at eight and I 'll take you to Putnam and Thurston 's . TOBEY ( Rises , starts out ; stops ) Jim , now that I 'm back here , the whole past is like a heavy sack around me . All the dead  --  my father and mother  --  Dan and Willie  --  the anonymous dead . ( Sits on sofa ) What does it all mean anyway ? JIM NIGHTINGALE Why does life have to have meaning ? It 's good in itself . That oboe is good . What Willie gave you was good . Dinner tonight will be good  --  I hope ! ( Sitting beside him ) You speak of the anonymous dead . They 're not anonymous . They 're figures in the tapestry in which we ourselves are figures . They 've given us what we are . When you 're young , you try to get away from them . But when you 're mature , you return to them . You 'll embrace them . And they 'll support you , I promise you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  every note you set down  --  you 're living off them . ( Rises ) Now , clear out ! TOBEY ( Rises , goes to door ) All right , Jim . I 'll go . ( Stands at the door , looking out through the twilight ) The seven hills of Worcester JIM NIGHTINGALE ( Brusquely ) Lift your eyes to them ! See you at eight ! ( TOBEY goes out . JIM starts playing his oboe . We see TOBEY , his stance more buoyant , his head up , walking down the street accompanied by the sound of Handel 's melody )
