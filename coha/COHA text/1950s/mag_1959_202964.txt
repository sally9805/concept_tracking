As Mamie Eisenhower stepped off the train at Philadelphia on the way to christen the nuclear ship Savannah last week ( see The Atom ) , a telegram from the President was handed to her . Turning to a stocky , crop-haired man in her party , she said , " I want to be the first to congratulate you , " and passed the telegram along to him . Thus was Frederick H. Mueller , 65 , informed that he had been chosen to fill the hole in the Eisenhower team left by the Senate 's rejection of Lewis Strauss ( TIME , June 15 et seq . ) . <P> Two good reasons made Michigan Republican " Fritz " Mueller a natural choice for Commerce Secretary : 1 ) as Assistant Secretary for three years ( 1955-58 ) , then Under Secretary , and finally Acting Secretary after Strauss 's resignation , ' he is better equipped than anyone else to step into the top job as time runs out in the Eisenhower Administration ; and 2 ) he should have little trouble getting Senate confirmation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Strauss fight was going on . Moreover , <P> Mueller had blue-ribbon endorsements from ex-Secretary Sinclair Weeks , Strauss , and Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield , a fellow Michigander . <P> Mueller describes himself as " a small businessman at heart . " and he spent most of his adult life , and some of his childhood , in small business . He was born in Grand Rapids in 1893 , one year after his German-born father established a furniture factory there . At 13 he was put to work in the factory , 16 years later was its general manager . The family firm still employs fewer than 100 workers , but Fritz Mueller has spread its name and fame by being a prodigious civic-affairs man-president of the Grand Rapids Furniture Makers Guild , the local United Hospital Fund , the Chamber of Commerce , and football-boosting member of the governing board of Michigan State University ( he holds an honorary M.S.U. doctor of laws degree and a gold-engraved lifetime pass to all M.S.U. athletic events ) . But neither his conservatism nor his clubbiness prevented him from pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its labor policies . <P> Outside the office , Mueller likes to read economics , enjoys bridge , plays golf in the 80s . In 1938 , when his wife ( who died last year ) gave him a plane as a Christmas present , he qualified as a pilot , survived one crash and went on to organize the Grand Rapids Civil Air Patrol , still has a passion for flying , though he gave up piloting in 1951 . Friends say Fritz Mueller looks younger than he did when he came to Washington in 1955 . " I happen to enjoy the stimulation of challenge , " said he , " and Washington is the place to find stimulation . "
