txt Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr . of Massachusetts , manager of the Campaign to make General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower the Republican Presidential nominee , emplaned at Idlewild Airport yesterday for a conference with General Eisenhower in Paris tomorrow . While Senator Lodge was uncommunicative about details and the purposes of his mission , these facts emerged as the present plans of the Eisenhower board of strategy : Senator Lodge 's trip was probably the final one on political matters before General Eisenhower 's resignation as Supreme Commander , Allied Powers in Europe , which is expected soon . ilAs the conference was arranged before the Wisconsin and Nebraska primaries of last Tuesday , at which Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio regained some ground , its conclusions will not be based on those primary results . qBarring a sudden crisis in North Atlantic Treaty Organization affairs , requiring the general to stay on the job , he will spend a number of weeks in Europe following his resignation but before its effective date , breaking in his successor to the NATO command . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his military affairs at the Pentagon and be in civilian clothes several weeks before the Republican convention in Chicago , which Starts July 7. 41While the dates were understood to have been set , they were not ascertainable yesterday . A logical time-table , however , would call for the general 's return the first week of June . This would give him time for the Pentagon and for possibly two or three major speeches before convention time . There are no plans for him to stump the country . Conference to Be Political All Senator Lodge would concede yesterday was that his conference with the general would be " political . " He said it would be his first such meeting as campaign manager , Senator Lodge said that he was not going over to " harry or heckle " the general into returning to this country , and that the date of the return would be determined by the requirements of his NATO duties .

A map of the United States was pin-pointed with flags denoting the location of each Eisenhower Club . They were sparse only in the Rocky Mountains . The questions asked of the Senator , however , had nothing to do with the number of Eisenhower clubs . He was asked whether he regarded the results of the Wisconsin and Nebraska primaries as setbacks for the general 's campaign . " They are not setbacks at all , " he replied , continuing : " In Wisconsin , it is noteworthy that the leading candidate Senator Taft with the complete backing of the powerful state organization , polled only about 40 per cent of the vote cast in the Republican primary , and that Governor Warren Earl Warren of California was able apparently to win six of the convention delegates despite the - fact that it was a three-cornered race . " Spelling Bee in Nebraska " " As far as Nebraska is concerned , it is apparent there that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One candidate had four letters to his name , easy to spell , and General Eisenhower had ten letters and they were under instructions to count only the names which were spelled correctly . " I can imagine what will happen in Illinois , where the law requires the voter to spell out the first name , middle initial and last name of a candidate and then mark an ' X beside it for the vote to be counted . " Senator Lodge said he did not know how many Eisenhower votes were invalidated in Nebraska because of the spelling requirement , but that his organization would attempt to find out . He declared that the New Jersey primary April 15 would be a " contest , despite Taft 's attempted withdrawal . " He suggested - that the Taft backers were working hard in that state and that the Eisenhower forces would have to guard against a let-down .
