A familiar pilot was back at the controls of RKO Pictures last week . Howard Hughes , who sold control of the studio only two months ago for $7,093,940 to a group headed by Chicago Promoter Ralph Stolkin , moved back into control without putting up any cash . Noah Dietrich , Hughes 's right-hand man and executive vice president of Hughes Tool Co. , is expected to become RKO president . With Dietrich and two other satellites on the five-man board , Hughes has complete control , although the Stolkin group still holds the majority ( 29% ) stock interest . <P> After a flood of unfavorable publicity had forced four Stolkin men to step down from the board , Stolkin turned to Hughes because he still has a sizable financial interest in RKO ( the group still owes Hughes some $6,000,000 , to be paid off in 2 years ) , and seemed to be the only one willing to try to put the studio 's humpty-dumpty operation together . Hughes , reluctant to step back into RKO , promised to keep his eccentric hand off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his associates will have to perform something like a miracle to get RKO on its feet . The studio has been losing $100,000 a week , has made one picture in the last five months , has been sued by a group of stockholders and has no movie production boss . Hughes 's first move was to announce plans for five movies ; his next task will be to try to persuade a big-name producer to take the job . Meanwhile , RKO 's 15,000 stockholders could only hope that one of the most harrowing scripts since The Great Train Robbery would somehow have a happy ending .
