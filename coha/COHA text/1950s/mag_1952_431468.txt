 | Rhoda Cross has been instrumental in solving seventy - eight murders and innumerable other crimes since she went to work in Los Angeles , twenty-six years ago . Today , she presides over thirty-five women who work night and day shifts in Room 63 of the Los Angeles City Hall . Room 63 is a long , windowless room in the catacombs of the Police Department , but it is bright with flowers and gay with pleasant voices . Mrs. Cross is a very feminine person who likes frilly dresses , laughs easily , and often rummages through heaps of papers on her desk in a seemingly helpless fashion . Her assistants are much the same . Nevertheless , they are all quick and deadly in their work of fighting crime in their city . Los Angeles detectives straggle into Room 63 with reports on from one to six unsolved crimes daily . In most cases , the women in this room are eventually able to find the solution . Frequently they go further , and predict where the criminal will turn up next . Yet they never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal . The keystone of this unique crime-fighting unit is Rhoda Cross . There is nothing in her background to suggest that she would make a good sleuth . A minister 's daughter , she went to a religious school and then to college , where she developed a flair for mathematics . When she looked for a statistical job after graduation , she found only one that sounded interesting ? a clerk 's position in the Los Angeles Police Department . August Vollmer , famous criminologist and first of the " scientific cops , " had just agreed to spend a year in Los Angeles reorganizing the department . He recognized her ability and put her to work tabulating police records , showing her how  | these records , if organized like a classifled , telephone directory , could catch criminals . Gradually , Mrs. Cross elaborated and refined Vollmer 's technique , until today it seems touched with magic . She devised a new set of forms for policemen 's reports , more detailed yet more simply worded than the standard forms used by most cities . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translate the reports into patterns of holes on cards . The basic working material of Room 63 ( more formally known as the Statistical Department ) consists of fourteen million cards . By an intricate punch-mark code , the details of every unlawful act reported by Los Angeles police in the past quarter century ? even traffic violations ? are recorded on these cards . About 5,000 new reports are added each day . This vast library is so finely classified and cross-indexed that the ladies can rapidly pick out , for example , all crimes committed by redheads in the past twenty-five years , or all purse snatchings on Tuesdays , or all murders involving silverware . MRS . CROSS and her aids get information from the cards through the use of high-speed electric sorting machines , which riffle through the cards at the rate of ten per second . Each machine contains a panel of adjustable metal brushes that " feel " the holes in a card and can be set to pick out cards punched in any given combinations . The power of card-sorting sleuthing lies in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits . He usually strikes at the same hour , steals the same type of valuables , smokes the same brand of cigarette , uses the same tricks in gaining entry , operates in simliar localities . In one way or several , a criminal leaves his " signature " on each job ? his modus operandi , as the police call it . In a big city , where dozens of crimes occur daily , the repetition of a modus operandi is likely to go unnoticed . But not in Los Angeles . Each time a criminal operates , machines in Room 63 drop another card into his slot , identifying his work almost as clearly as if he had left fingerprints . Moreover , most crimes are committed by repeaters ; the one-time lawbreaker is comparatively rare . Even those who are caught and sent to prison do not learn their lesson . That 's why Rhoda Cross systematically obtains the names and addresses of inmates released from every prison in California . Experience has led her to expect their trade-mark to appear again ? perhaps not immediately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work miracles of law enforcement . In one famous Los Angeles case , Mrs. Cross caused the capture of a gang of seven safecrackers only twenty minutes after they had committed what they thought was a perfeet crime . The neatness of their acetylene-torch work , the deftness with which they jimmied the skylight , and their disposal of the watchman were jigsaw pieces that the card-sorting machine fitted together to identify several ex-convicts who were masters of those practices . Following Mrs. Cross ' tip , police dropped in at one cracksman 's home while the whole gang was still there dividing the loot . Mrs. Cross has always used only female assistants in her department , for two reasons . First , women are faster and more accurate than men at the demanding task of coding , punching , and sorting cards . Second , and more important , the women prove repeatedly that their intuition can make the cards do startling tricks . Dorothy Reinagel , one of the girls in the department , solved a puzzling series crimes by pondering a queer description . Reports came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding up service stations . He seldom oke more than a word or two to his . etims . Nobody with a walrus mustache sd been arrested in Los Angeles for o decades . Dorothy suggested checking e cards for somebody with a harelip . The sorting machines flipped out a card : : a harelipped holdup man who had - rued two sentences in San Quentin : r.d was free again . Detectives visited home , discovered a false mustache , : : d quickly proved him guilty of the new : of crimes . On another occasion , wealthy homes all er Los Angeles were being burglarized. : rs and diamonds were invariably een .

One such burglar , while stealing a saxophone , cased up a fur coat and other valuables. . : -e had been shrewd enough to strip the se of all valuables , Mrs. Cross might been baffled . Instead , she ran cards : she found a burglar who had spezed in stealing musical instruments : s previously . He was once more at e after a term in prison . Detectives sikly put him back in prison . Spectacular cases do n't occur often . Ltost of the Statistical Department 's work a routine " running the cards " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Here 's a holdup in a hotel . it have you on hotel robberies the : iew years ? " .

" No deep thought is needed to provide such answers . The women merely set the machines and pour in the cards . But frequently a special insight can make those fourteen million cards give up a secret buried among them . Patterns are sometimes so obscured by a criminal that no one can see his trail ? until a lightningflash idea strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made Bertha Bindrup decide to sort cards for hundreds of current burglaries to learn the occupation of each victim . The machine stacked up fourteen cards for unmarried men who worked for a streetcar company and whose homes had been burglarized in recent months . Mrs. Bindrup surmised that someone in the company who knew when each of the employes was on duty might be the thief . Acting on her tip , detectives shadowed a lad at the carbarn whose job involved summoning streetcar men to work by telephone . Then , certain that their homes were empty , he went there to steal . Detectives were waiting for him in the next home he entered . AT ONE time , a clubfooted bandit often appeared on Room 63 's daily summaries . He limped into small shops where there were only women attendants , terrorized them with a revolver , and emptied the cash registers . Eyewitnesses unanimously agreed that his right foot was crippled . In the files were names and pictures of three different robbers who wore built-up right shoes . But the victims insisted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Cross sifted out a card for an ex-convict whose left shoe was built up . This time the witnesses identified the picture , and the man was picked up by detectives a day later . " We 've learned not to put too much faith in people 's powers of observation when a crime is taking place , " Mrs. Cross says . " I remember one stick-up man who specialized in dentists ' offices . He wore false teeth , as we found when we eventually caught him , but not one dentist had noticed this . " Mrs. Cross spends hours sticking pins on maps , watching for geographical patterns . Sometimes the pins will point to an area where a criminal may appear next . Detectives can then go there and wait for him . In 1939 , a murderer was terrorizing the city of Los Angeles . He walked the streets after dark , bludgeoning girls when he caught them alone . He left no clues and no survivors . Dozens of detectives , disguised in women 's clothes , spent hours walking the darkest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all they definitely uncovered was a footprint , and it matched nothing in the files . Rhoda Cross thrashed about her office , sorting hundreds of thousands of cards over and over , trying one combination after another , groping to arrange the murders into some pattern . On a desperate hunch , she sorted an enormous stack of burglary cards to see if a thief was working the murder area . One was ! Moreover , he broke into houses at about the same time of night that the killer waylaid girls . The pattern had emerged . Mrs. Cross sent a memo to her immediate superior , the Assistant Chief of Police : " The murderer we are looking for is probably also a burglar . About 11:00 some night soon , he may break into the side window of some house in the area marked on the attached map . " An army of police hid in that area each  | evening . Within a week , they caught the burglar . His shoe matched the murderer 's footprint . He confessed and was later executed . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official , has seldom felt tempted to give up her job . Almost from the beginning , her department has been famous in criminological circles . Police have traveled from three continents to study its operation . According to Vollmer , who trained her , Mrs. Cross is the greatest police statistician in America . " The material you have accumulated is by all odds the most valualble police data in existence , " he wrote in a letter to her several years ago . Despite the recognized value of its worth , no other police department keeps such detailed data . Los Angeles has long known that its statisticians play a leading role in holding the unsolved-crime rate far below what it is in most cities . More than twenty years ago , when Mrs. Cross began giving tips to detectives , they caught thieves so fast that the number of thefts , which had totaled around two thousand the previous year , did n't hit two thousand again until the city had doubled in population , years later . Crime fighting would be an easier and more successful task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national card file available to all . Testimony before the Kefauver Committee recommended such a plan , and it was suggested by the Wickersham Commission as far back as twenty years ago . If the plan ever becomes reality , the high-powered gangs who operate across the country , importing thugs and racketeers from one city to another to escape detection , could soon be identified . Cities could work together in uncovering networks of organized crime , as well asl in fighting individual lawbreakers . When that begins to happen , criminals ? big and little ? will find it harder and harder to stay out of prison .
