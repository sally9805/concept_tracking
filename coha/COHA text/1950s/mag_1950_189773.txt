For two years Dmitri Shostakovich had been trying to " reconstruct " his composing to make his music fall more sweetly on the Kremlin ear . It seemed that was not enough . Last week he was told how fast he should compose . Complained the Soviet Composers Union in Pravda : Shostakovich had not worked hard enough to finish his new opera on the 1917 Russian Revolution , October . While comradely criticisms were being passed around , piped Pravda , the Composers Union had shown too much " complacency " about the whole matter itself . <P> In Czechoslovakia , musical reconstruction was booming . Program features of the Slovak Philharmonic last week : Cantata on the Communist Party , Cantata on Communist Premier Klemenf Gottwald , Toast to Stalin .
