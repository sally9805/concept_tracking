Was it fitting &; proper for the Fon ( King ) of Bikom to have as many wives as he liked ? The U.N . has been burdened with this question since July 1948 , when St. Joan 's Social and Political Alliance of London ( a Roman Catholic lay organization dedicated to women 's rights ) presented a complaint concerning plural marriage in the British Cameroons . One missionary , said the complaint , had reported that the Fon had 600 wives , charged that he had taken one girl to his harem by force . Last year the U.N . Trusteeship Council sent a visiting mission off to West Africa to investigate . Last week the mission sent in its report . <P> Accompanied by fierce-looking Fulani horsemen and hundreds of the Fon 's loinclothed subjects , the U.N . emissaries had crossed formidable rivers , climbed 3,000 feet up slippery mountain paths . A bit footsore , they finally reached the Fon 's tiny city of elaborately decorated houses and well-paved courtyards . Reported the mission , of the Fon : " Probably more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 100 ) , he is now in a stage when he can take a lenient view of this interference in what he might regard as his private affairs . " But he pointed out that he did not deliver opinions upon the peculiar habits of Christian society ; why , then , had the outside world taken exception to his own tribe 's age-old customs ? In his capacity as King of all Kom Villages , Rainmaker , Custodian of the Tribal Lands and Link between the Dead , the Living and the Unborn , it was his job to see that tradition was preserved . <P> Furthermore , by latest census , the Fon has only 110 wives , not 600. * Forty-four of them are very old ladies whom he inherited from his predecessor . All of them , the Fon explained , lead useful and happy lives , and they are all free to leave the compound . Often the older wives themselves ask the Fon to take new wives to help with the housework . The U.N . investigators found no case where a girl had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fon had only one regret : he was too old to sire any more children . <P> " Plural marriage in Bikom , " the U.N . mission report concluded , " . . . is a type of social security which will have to remain until Western civilization through education convinces the Africans that other ways are better and preferable . " <P> <P> * The Fon is in more danger of loneliness than King Solomon , who had 700 wives , and King Mtessa of Buganda ( 1857-1884 ) who is said to have had 7,000.
