Getting its R.O.T.C. students ready for active duty after graduation , the University of Wyoming has not neglected their wives and fiances . Last week , 22 young women turned out to hear a guest specialist , Mrs. Dorothy Irwin , wife of retired Brigadier General C. L. Irwin , outline the contours of Army etiquette . Stressing the importance of the service wife 's role ( " Wives are even mentioned in efficiency reports about their husbands " ) , bouncy , silver-haired Dorothy Irwin quickly got down to cases : <P> " The first thing you and your husband must do is make a call . In my day you always called on the post 's commanding officer . But in some cases , he is too busy to see you , and you call on the unit commander . Check with the adjutant ; he always knows everything . Leave your calling cards on this visit . You leave one card ( because a lady never calls on a gentleman ) , and your husband leaves two ( he calls on both husband and wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady does n't call on him . <P> " At a formal dinner you have no artificial flowers or lace . All your candles are white . You must have menservants , no waitresses . . . and no bread and butter plates are used ( there are so many courses you do n't have enough room for bread ) . No toothpicks , please . That is absolutely unforgivable . " <P> After the lecture , Mrs. Irwin showed her listeners a semiformal dinner setting that she had arranged as a model . Then she remembered an inviolate rule : " I forgot to tell you , girls , coffee ranks tea . " Explanation : when coffee and tea are served in the living room ( never , never in the dining room ) , the top-ranking officer 's wife pours the coffee , the subordinate 's wife the tea .
