Over his San Juan newsstand in Texas ' lower Rio Grande Valley , Quentin Newcombe tacked a sign : " The Valley Evening Monitor , the Valley Morning Star and the Brownsville Herald are . . . against our American public-school system . Buy other newspapers and help drive these objectionable carpetbaggers from our valley . " The " carpetbagger " Newcombe meant is 73-year-old Raymond Cyrus Hoiles , a pinch-faced Californian who looks and acts as if he had just bitten into an unripe persimmon . <P> Until three months ago , few valley Texans had ever heard of Hoiles . Then , for $2,000,000 , his Freedom Newspapers Inc. bought the three main valley dailies-the Brownsville Herald , Harlingen 's Morning Star and McAllen 's Evening Monitor ( total circ. 37,500 ) . From his Santa Ana , Calif , headquarters , old " R.C. " himself rode into the valley on a bus to reshape the papers according to Hoiles . He threw out Drew Pearson 's column , replaced him with Fulton Lewis , George Sokolsky , and his own column . His favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground that free , tax-supported education violates the Ten Commandments . Taxing those who do not use public schools , he says , is stealing . <P> Violent Objections . To readers of the seven other papers in Hoiles 's string* of small-city dailies , such crackpot cerebrations have come to be part of the routine grist from the Hoiles mill , to be taken with the news . Among other Hoiles convictions : Herbert Hoover and the National Association of Manufacturers are too leftish , churches are socialistic , majority rule should be abolished , and so should aid to Europe , all involuntary taxes , and unions . Most of his readers have no choice but to read Hoiles papers ; in nine of the ten cities , there is no competition . But there have been violent objections . Four times his plants have been struck . Once his home was bombed . <P> Residents of the valley took different action . Meetings protested Hoiles ' stand . The McAllen P.T.A . sent parents a statement which suggested canceling subscriptions " to a paper which denounces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,000 readers ; circulations of the others also slid . <P> Harmless Crackpot ? Then Houston Lawyer-Industrialist Roy Hofheinz , 39 , who had opened a 50,000-watt radio station , KSOX , in Harlingen , joined the attack on Hoiles in an all-out crusade over the air . His station also began taking ads away from the Hoiles papers . Partly because he was pinched by this competition , and partly because they disagreed with him , Hoiles fired the three editors who had stayed on when he bought the papers . <P> Radioman Hofheinz broadcast a defense of the editors , added : " There may be those who say that Hoiles is a harmless crackpot . A man backed with a reputed $20 million and a chain of newspapers can not be classed as a harmless crackpot . " It looked as if Hoiles might have to mend his editorials , if he wanted to stay in the valley . <P> <P> *The Santa Ana , Calif .
