txt The dust in China itself is likely to settle before the political dust kicked up in Washington by the battle over Formosa ( Taiwan ) settles . And it is doubtful whether historians of the future ever will be able to discover the whole truth about all the ins and outs of the affair . This writer certainly is not able to present all the facts , but he has been digging around in the debris for what would seem to be substantial . Herewith are some preliminary results of the explora-tion : 1 . Gen. Douglas never has put himself on record in any official communication as favoring American occupation of Formosa , or even the sending of an American advisory mission . The nearest he ever came to making such a proposal was in midsummer of 1947 , when he sent to Washington an official request for more troops and cited a long list of reasons why he should have them . One reason was the suggested possibility that someday we might want to put troops in ' Formosa . This was not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has given some of his recent political visitors an impression that he favored a move into Formosa . They even seem to be under an impression that he told them he had made formal representations . But there is no such recommendation in the records of the Army Department or of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . There was never any such recommendation before the President . * 2 . The Joint Chiefs of Staff never recommended the placing of American troops in Formosa , or even sending an American advisory mission to Formosa . And there was never any " reversal " of the position of the JCS on this matter . The basic view of the JCS is formulated in a paper prepared toward the end of the war . What that paper recommends is " top secret , " like all papers of the JCS . But we have several clues to its contents . The " Formosa Paper " was brought out and reexamined in midsummer of 1947 when General asked for additional troops and cited the occupation of Formosa as one possible use for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the paper was returned to the files confirmed and unchanged . The paper was reviewed in March , 1949 . On Aug. 16 of this year , when public agitation over Formosa first started , one member of the JCS suggested that they have the " Formosa Paper " out for another look . They did so , and it went back unchanged and confirmed . It was brought out once more just before the present ruckus . Again it was reexamined , and again it went ? back unchanged . Nothing was ever done about Formosa after any of these reviews . Hence , presumably , the paper did not favor doing anything . 3 . Defense Secretary Louis Johnson personally favored sending an advisory mission to Formosa , just as General presumably did . There is this difference , Mr. Johnson 's views are on the public record , while General 's are known only from what he is. alleged by others to believe or favor . But Mr. Johnson did not favor sending American troops . Mr. Johnson reraised the subject of Formosa toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to do anything about it and partly because $75,000,000 authorized for military aid to Asia only'recently had become available . Here was ! honey andthere was Formosa . Mr. Johnson wanted to put them togethe ? . Mr. Johnson ordered the JCS to study and answer the hypothetical question " what could be done with $75,000,000 on Formosa if it were decided to use the money there ? " The JCS answered the hypothetical question . But the JCS did not , recommend the action . A A * 4 . On the military level , General Bradley presented the JCS estimate of what could be done with the $75,000,000 on Formosa at the meeting of the National Security Council before the President on Dec. 29 . On the political level , Dean Acheson followed with the State Department 's approach to the problem . The President at that time ruled out any idea of American intervention in Formosa , and endorsed the Acheson political view . But the decision was not announced then , partly because to do so would weaken further the Chiang Kai-shek regime . The President did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . His statement of Jan. 5 accorded fully with his position of Dec. 29. 5 . Some men in Secretary Acheson 's service suspect Secretary Johnson 's staff of " leaking " from Tokyo on Jan. 3 a secret State Department guidance directive on Formosa dated Dec. 23 in a last attempt to break the State Department position . Men . in Secretary Johnson 's office suspect Secretary Acheson 's staff of planting ' the " leak " in Tokyo to make it appear that Secretary Johnson had done it . Both groups of men are grown up in years and size . It would help personal relations between the two offices if the true story of the " leak " could be uncovered ; unless , of course , the truth should confirm the suspicions of one or the other ,
