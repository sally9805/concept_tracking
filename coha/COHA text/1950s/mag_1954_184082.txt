The first and freshest pictorial record of Indian life west of the Mississippi was made during the 1830s by iron-willed George Catlin . The civilized world had been taught to regard the Indians either as demigods ( by James Fenimore Cooper ) or as demihumans ( by frontiersmen 's reports ) . Catlin showed them as they were and as they lived . His pictures came as a revelation to Manhattan , London and Paris . <P> This year , more than a century later , Catlin 's triumph was again underlined by a touring exhibition of his work in Europe . Sponsored by the U.S. Information Agency and ( and supplied by the Smithsonian Institution ) , it arrived in the French town of Valenciennes after being in Essen , Munich and Hamburg . As visual , visitors found Catlin 's pictures just as surprising and intriguing as their great-grandfathers had . <P> Sight &; Decision . Caitlin 's motehr was once captured by Indians , and he himself was born near the frontier-at Wilkes-Barre , Pa. , in 1796 .

The sight made him resolve on the spot that " the history and customs of such a people , preserved by . . . illustrations , are themes worthy of the lifetime of one man , and nothing short of the loss of my life shall prevent me from visiting their country and of becoming their historian . " <P> When Catlin disappeared up the Missouri River , he entered a splendid new world . The natural setting was vast and varied , the Indians rich and strange . The prosperity of the plains tribes had been enormously boosted by the introduction of Spanish horses from New Mexico and California . The Mandan , the Sioux , the Comanche , the Blackfoot , the Crow and a score more nations were at the climax of their glory-which white pressure was to crush in a matter of decades . <P> Grit &; Tact . By sheer grit , Catlin , burdened with painting materials , made his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seven years . By instinctive tact , he gained the hospitality of the Indians and overcame their superstitious fears of his brush and canvas . He came back with a priceless historical and artistic record consisting of some 500 pictures , and a lively respect for his Indian friends . Wrote Catlin in his journal : " An Indian is a beggar in Washington City , and a white man is almost equally so in the Mandan village . An Indian in Washington is mute , is dumb and embarrassed ; and so is a white man ( and for the very same reasons ) in this place . " <P> Actually Catlin never could match the skill of such later Wild West witnesses as Remington and Russell . The human figure bothered him ; he tended to make it too squat . He used colors more like a mapmaker than like an artist . But Catlin had the crack journalist 's eye both for significant sweep and significant detail . And without being dazzled by the romance of his magnificent adventure , he felt and expressed it keenly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
