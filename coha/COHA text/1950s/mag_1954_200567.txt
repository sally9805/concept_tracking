For six days last week , Red General Giap was able to move his infantry , his field artillery and his rocket-launchers down unobstructed roads toward the greatest single objective in all IndoChina : the teeming , rice-rich Red River Delta and its center , Hanoi . <P> The strategic delta is one of the world 's most densely populated areas ; in this flat alluvial plain live 7,000,000 people . A phantom Red army of some 90,000 guerrillas already controls at least two-thirds of the delta by day , almost all of it by night . The 2,000 French-Vietnamese forts there are atolls in a seeming Red Sea . <P> For 60 successive days , the Red guerrillas in the delta had been strong enough to dig trenches and lay mines across vital Route Coloniale 5-Hanoi 's only main road link with its supply port , Haiphong . Last week some 2,000 Communists stormed a French battalion position 36 miles from Hanoi and a Vietnamese outpost less than seven miles from the city . <P> Giap clearly intended to keep the delta Frenchmen off balance while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redeployed them from the malarial jungles before the monsoon set in . Giap 's likely next moves : first , break Route Coloniale 5 and isolate Hanoi ; second , storm Hanoi . <P> The French had fewer than 20,000 in Hanoi , 50,000 ( mostly shaky Vietnamese ) elsewhere in the delta , and they were desperately flying in reinforcements from southern Indo-China and from France and North Africa ( via U.S. airlift ) . Commanding General Navarre reportedly asked Paris for two fresh divisions , yet his officers did their best to appear calm and unconcerned . Said Navarre 's top deputy in Hanoi last week : " The situation in the delta is serious , but not desperate . " French generals said exactly that during the last days at Dienbienphu.
