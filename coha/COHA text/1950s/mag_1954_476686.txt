There are perils for art and man in the democracy of culture . A brilliant critic ? author of the forthcoming book , God 's Country and Mine ? analyzes the values we teach , preach , and sell as part of the Western heritage . WHATEVER department of life one thinks of today , one must admit that the idea of culture is in the ascendant . Pro Arte is not just the name of a quartet , it is the motto of the age . The belief has spread-over the world that a great nation must have art . All the totalitarian powers produce the kind they like under pressure ; all the governments , including ours , have cultural attaches . UNESCO may be a mess but it is a fact . Come closer home and you must acknowledge that there is not a periodical , not a school , not a corporation , not a public body that does not favor art and culture , at least in words . They do n't dare do otherwise , even if they have doubts , envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind has been strengthening for twenty years . George F. Babbitt , you will remember , was not all real estate and hardheadedness about money ; he had a soft side wreathed in dreaminess . He accordingly did not need to be dethroned and guillotined , he was merely turned around so that the soft side would show in a good light . And he must be really soft , since he legislated the Fulbright act , which turned back swords into plowshares for our young to cultivate their minds with , and since he devised a tax structure that bribes the rich to give for cultural purposes . The funds so given in our country are enormous , incredibly so , not only by comparison with fifty years ago but by comparison with other nations . Though they startedearlier and continue to criticize us for barbarism , the fact is that we have been leading the cultural world in method and organization for a quarter century . Please note that I say " method and organization . " Our libraries , museums , and schools , our local bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indexes , our lectures , visual aids , broadcasts , and pictorial reproductions , and most lately our cheap paper-covered books are the most convenient , numerous , and best disseminated that the world has seen . We have democratized culture ? or perhaps , to speak the language of the time , one ought to say " cultural materials . " It took the princes of Europe a thousand years to learn to be patrons . When their mantle descended to us the people , it took us about a century and a half ? say , from the Declaration of Independence to the New York Museum of Modern Art . O UR great merit and advantage is of course federalism , many centers and local control ; and the natural device for adapting this tradition to cultural purposes is the university . We were the first to attach the fine arts to the severe sciences and thus to indoctrinate every college generation as it passes by . It is to our universities that the great artistic donations go , whether the foundations ' assigning of resident artists here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent gift to Northwestern ? tour million dollars to " advance musical understanding and enjoyment . " The university is now not only a sanctuary for poets and painters , it is the refuge for the little theater , the small opera company , the string ensemble ? all of which have good reasons for avoiding the competitive struggle of the outer world . In short , what the United States has done for itself is to recreate the German princely courts of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to which we owe so much . This diversity is , on the face of it , infinitely better for the individual talent and for culture as a whole than centralized control by bureaucrats or personal patronage . All human merit is comparative , and we do not appreciate our cultural abundance because we have lost the memory of what scarcity is . But a recent experience with a Chinese student-in-exile gave me an inkling of it : he was found tossing library books around and about and underfoot , and when remonstrated with he said that books in this country seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could not regard them as valuable : " Why , even the common people have them ! " T 0 OUR democratic arrangements for culture the common people have re- sponded . In 1900 , according to some Co-lumbia University records I was lately going through , our composer MacDowell was deploring the fact that there were no applicants for the several fellowships in his department . Today there are hundreds of applicants for every grant or prize that we can lay our hands on . As one who has sat on national award committees , I can testify that this country produces four or five talented people for each one that is chosen . The country is rich in amateur players , singers , and painters . The President of the United States is perhaps painting at this very minute and no one thinks any less of him for his hobby . He can take it or leave it alone ; and he is not a sissy , since he can also fish . As for the young men and women whom I encounter as a teacher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic career than when I was myself a student . Except in a few colleges the " line " has changed ; it is no longer smart to be anti-intellectual ; on the contrary , the less gifted or more self-seeking apologize for not being aesthetes . In the big world , all groups and professions are now deemed eligible for participation in the arts . Physicians arid lawyers are not thought frivolous if they sing or play music . The institutes of technology are more and more introducing courses in the humanities , so that in a few years the word engineer will no longer be a polite way of saying Philistine . In the public eye the man of art and the man of thought have achieved status . We think we are riding a wave of anti-intellectualism because certain such men are attacked ; the fact is that they are attaWed because they have become important . Our near contemporary , Henry Adams , complained all his life of being unread , a nobody that nobody reckoned with : today his name would lead off every denunciation by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would be a power in the land . THE main reason for the elevation of the intellectual and the artist is that a tre-mendous unofficial propaganda for the arts is going on all the time , supplementing the official . It begins with advertising , of which the necessary snobbery now includes culture ? just think of the series that reads : As an old master proudly signs work so does a manufacturer put his trade mark on a can of beans . Incredible ! But even this is elementary , primitive : advertising has achieved a greater miracle in popularizing difficult modern art . If we are up to Matisse and Modigliani it is largely because dilute imitations of their styles have been forced on our attention apropos of gloves and perfumes . The mass media plug culture of set purpose , and they do it harder and better than their own politics . Every week Life stuffs modern poetry , great art collections , stories of - Western culture , and resumes of science down the throats of several million people . It is a high-brow magazine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sartre are news . Meanwhile the record industry and the radio have made classical music something other than a subject of jokes against dry-asdust people ? so much so that the interchange between classical and popular music is now a two-way traffic in tunes and rhythms . You can hear Ravel 's " Pavane " adapted to the juke-box audience , and our chief composers have a pied- ? - terre in Tin Pan Alley . In a word , the fusion of elite and people , which began as a political and social movement , has now reached culture and is ? shall I say ? ? homogenizing it . AG AINST this view of America 's devotion to culture , there are common and important objections . " All you say is true . . . . But ? but it - does not begin to be enough . Have n't you yourself admitted that there were four or five talented people for every one that wins a Enlbright Fellowship ? Are not our private colleges and universities perishing for lack of funds ? Do you not know of painters wasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sell ? And must n't we discount a good deal of the publicity about artists as lip service ? There is no profound respect for the artist deep in the people 's heart or it would buy American , in the graphic arts especially . How can you be so complacent when the need for more support is so obvious and pressing ? " These countervailing facts are also true , but what do they show ? They show that a career in the arts is still competitive and difficult . They show that the problem of patronage has not been solved , now any more than in earlier times . Millions are born with some sort of talent that we call artistic . Many others , with little or no talent , are convinced that an intellectual career is the only career for them . In these conditions , how avoid a weeding out ? of those nursing an illusion , of those with talent but no skill to use it , of those with promise but without will power to survive the struggle and produce ? In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , we tend to forget how strenuous that life is , what demonic energies and iron discipline are needed simply to do , to accomplish something . Art does not arise out of mere encouragement and opportunity . And if by magic we could provide training and work for every qualified person , we should only worsen the struggle by attracting still more competitors . We should increase the confusion and leave the successful still dissatisfied , for they would want fame also by social fiat . But this is only the first phase of the democratic difficulty in culture . It is clear that assoon as you offer prizes in prestige and power you create discontent ; it is less clear but no less true that as soon as you make fine art a general social concern you create friction of a political , moral , and aesthetic kind . Painters want to paint as they like and be paid for it by the community . But the community has ideas of its own , and when it does not approve what it has paid for ? as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon dispute over a statue of Venus ? the artist once more feels put upon . Whether in money or in smiles , the relation of the artist to society will always be tense and difficult . We can not hope to regularize it as we do that of the manual or clerical worker , because the artist 's case is always special , unique . His work is by nature public and provocative . And while we are speaking of fair treatment ; we must ask how in fact we treat other professional talents . Do we guarantee a livelihood to lawyers and inventors ? why then to architects and poets ? T ET us grant that artistic talent is more precious and more vulnerable ; can it be said that other cultures succeed better in making use of it ? A good many illusions prevail on this last point . Our Friends who visit South America come back with tales of the quasi-religious obeisance which is given there to poets and novelists and composers . Young men form a hedge as a great man walks to his cafe for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Paris clique life leaves me with a lackluster eye . Artists do need response and respect for what they do . They do not need , and no man is better for receiving , the automatic cult of a Roman Emperor . A more serious comparison to our disadvantage involves practical matters . Europe seems to be alive with productive Bohemias , little theaters , and little magazines , whereas with us all such enterprises are scarce and precarious ; crippled and killed by expense . Our lavish ways , it would seem , destroy art . The truer way to express it is that abroad art lives off the poor , whereas we pay at standard rates for all the workaday labor that art requires ? the man who shifts scenery or prints books . The driver of the truck containing the Pepsi-Cola Art Collection earns as much as if he were driving bottles instead of canvases . This is also the reason why our private colleges are in straits . The costs of maintenance have risen faster than endowments . But the way to meet this is implicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the legal surtax in exchange for gifts to education and culture . If corporate management can grasp the situation quickly enough , and will institutionalize such gifts , it can easily avert federal control of private enterprise in learning . The distrust of government I express here does not spring from economic or political doctrine but , once again , from a consideration of art and its patronage . If the relation of the artist to the local community is difficult , despite the ease of communication between them , the relation of all the nation 's artists to a central government bureau must be a source of endless trouble , aggravated by the equal relation of all the taxpayers to that same agency . To this the usual reply is that since the public at large is not sufficiently educated to enjoy art , and fails to support the good things actually being produced , " something must be done . " But can we allow , in whatever form ? whether government bureau or closed shop ? a vested interest in cultural affairs ? Is it true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inherent claim upon the public ? If we say " art " the proposition seems reasonable , but if we say " artists " its character changes and the avowed aim defeats itself : we as a people believing in art pledge ourselves to support artists ; here is an artist : we must support him , provided he shows up with his violin or paintbrush , his diploma and proof of citizenship . We start out to obtain culture and wind up with pensioners who show their identification cards . III A s TO whether the majority of the people care for art , I not only grant that they do not but I maintain that it is their privilege not to care . Mankind as a whole does not actively want to concern itself with what we call culture , never has done so , and possibly never will . It is only in the literature of travel agencies that Italy is found to contain nothing but enchanting people who are all " a bit of a poet and a bit of a musician . " In reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women such as we meet in every part of the world . Most people are busy making a living and finding a little recreation . This of course is the place for the culture salesman 's entering wedge : recreation ? why not music , the ballet , a visit to the art gallery or a good book ? Well , all our libraries , museums , and universities are such salesmen , and highly successful . We coax arid cajole and lure and threaten : " No man can be called educated who has not our set of hooks . Join the Classics Club , the Readers ' Subscription ' , the Seven Arts Society . " We agitate and make wild promises , not only when we have tangible goods to sell , but when our motive is , as we used to say , disinterested ; its aim being to impart the tastes and form the habits of the cultivated man . B LIT so far as I know , no one ever meets the question why it is desirable that all men , or even any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . Whoever says that reading St. Augustine or listening to Beethoven 's Opus 95 is the easy , spontaneous way to rest after a hard day 's work at the office is simply lying . Habit makes artistic attention prompt and pleasurable , but attention takes mind and physical energy . When I have neither , I read detective stories like my neighbor . So in preaching culture to him I dare not promise that it will bring the recreation he chiefly wants ; I am asking him instead for more effort , more expense of every kind , even more worry about the meaning of life . How can this be justified ? Again so far as I know , I am the only person who takes the chance of a truthful answer . I say : " You take up culture at your peril and for no other reason than to become more like me than you are at present . " This scares many away , naturally , but it goads others into proving that they can he cultured and not at all like me . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share with like-minded people a certain knowledge , certain thoughts and feelings , and the pleasures of certain activities . That is all there is to it ? but it is , to the partakers , of the first importance . Once this taste or habit is acquired , like an umbrella turned inside out , one ca n't go back . So no one really knows whether the second state is better than the first . All cultivated people truly think it is and so do I , but I suspect that our proselytizing is at least in part gregarious . We want company . There are many mansions in the house of culture and ours is strengthened by new recruits . As for the civic appeal , it is surely mistaken . The assumption that a large cultured class will manage public affairs ' better than a strictly business class has never been proved . There never was a more cultivated group of men than the European diplomatic corps between 1870 and 1914 , yet they brought their own world down in ruins upon their cultivated heads . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the men who have tinkered with the Republic since its foundation ? unsuccessfully . There never was a people more respectful of die Gelehrten than the Germans , yet their politics have been disastrous too . The proportion of elite to people may vary , but the course of empire is seldom directly affected by it . The ancient Greeks had possibly more culture than was good for them as a nation . It did not keep them from killing Socrates , disbelieving Demosthenes , and worse still ? spending on architecture what should have gone into defense . ULTURAL activities , therefore , are a luxury , which does not imply that they are superfluous . All luxuries have a moral effect . This is why they can be so demoralizing in the wrong place . In the United States today , culture is part and parcel of our coming of age . It betokens self-confidence , it leads to the adornment of life after a century of grim toil and social emancipation , it proves ? if any proof were needed ? that we are not money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are transferable to other things than consumers ' goods . We have even made a happy blend of industrial production and artistic form , so that more and more of the things we handle everyday have art mixed with them ? surely a sign of general culture : we seem to have as much of it as we can afford and assimilate . This does not mean that its distribution or management is perfect . Hence I join in all the revivalist preaching that aims at improving the corner where we are . We can use more money throughout the academic , museum , library , and concert world . But to try by shaming and hectoring to divert more andmore people from business or philandering and make them guiltily dissatisfied with life so as to stick paint brushes into their hands or violins under their chins strikes me as going out of our way to borrow trouble . It resembles our inefficient and hard-up Post Office decreeing a National Letter-Writing Week . Let us begin by delivering the letters that are in the bag ; let us solidify our cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth of so much devotion . IV v OR we must face the possibility of a great , an almost irretrievable danger ? a danger which can be understood only if we ask ourselves what art is for , aside from an elegant pastime . What is its relation to the rest of experience , what gives it such a hold on the feelings of men , why do tribes and peoples and nations instinctively respect it , while also fearing it and suspecting it ? Like philosophy , but clothed in seductive forms , art records man 's consciousness about life and death . Appearance and Reality are the main concern of both artist and philosopher : the artist makes patterns so as to focus the beholder 's feelings upon what his life is really like ; art makes us imagine once again what we actually are underneath the cloak of convention . The awareness of death gives the philosopher his idea of an absolute in experience ; the consciousness of life gives the artist the materials for his deliberate relativism . Man as philosopher keeps seeking for the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of view , which we find in the varied and opposing schools of art . The " one true art " is an absurd ideal that never crosses our mind . Art and philosophy thus complement each other and supply the images and habits of thought that we call culture . If this is so , some of the familiar facts of our cultural life are explained ? why , in the first place , art is difficult , rare , and valuable ? a question we tend to forget ; why , again , the great artist is more or less at odds with society ; he , trying to change its perceptions ; we , the mass , refusing to see through his eyes because it is upsetting to do so . We accept him when he is dead , that is to say , when the symbols he used have been somewhat dimmed by the changing conditions of our life . We can understand , too , why the artist must be both wise and foolish , both mature and na ? ve , transcending the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly by remaining innocent ; he does not gloss over what he feels ; and he can stand stronger feelings , face harsher realities than the middling sensual man . This is also why there can be no such thing as children 's art . It may show imagination and skill , but it inevitably lacks the full consciousness of man 's existence . A R-r , in short , embodies a special kind of knowledge about the roots of our being , and it follows that the way art is dealt with determines the amount of this knowledge that is taken in . The danger in our present cultural zeal is that in pushing " the arts , - in generalizing culture , we shall lose the specific virtue of art . What we are self-conscious about in our crusade is not life and death and their mysterious sources and ramifications . We are self-conscious about artifacts . We are concerned with ways and means of producing and distributing them ; we run to technique . Technique is indeed essential to art ; it is , so to speak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notice how art-like all the popular forms of entertainment have grown under this confusion of technique with art . Technically , there is nothing finer than a Hollywood movie ; in our weekly magazines , in our broadcasting studios , technique is an obsession , and if virtuosity did mean virtue , we 'd have it . But we all recognize that beyond a certain pleasure that is given by neat presentation , the techniques stifle thought instead of serving it . Let us not however jump to the conclusion that this is a purely American vice . Rather , it is the mark upon us of industry and science , a mark that no modern people has escaped . We find it in all the works and all the criticism of Western art since 1875 ; the critics preach the supremacy of form and seem to delight only in the details of manufacture ; they grow " scientific " analyzing vowel sounds and metaphors . On the other side , the creators vie with each other matching tricks and devices ? part of their trade at all times , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new chord is sure of immortality for a week . As for the performing techniquesduring the same period , whether on an instrument , in print , or on the stage , they have improved out of all recognition ? and out of all necessity . In the strict sense of the word , then , we are connoisseurs . We have the same relation to art as the kings , merchant princes , and other collectors . They loved nice things ; so do we . They knew the best period ; so do we ; they accumulated and preserved for posterity with a jealous care ; so do we . But if we had a great artist among us , and he could be persuaded to speak the truth , he would scorn our vain , fussy , or jolly little ways . He would say : " Art is fun , yes ; but it is not the ' good clean fun ' you suppose . Art is not ' wholesome . ' Symphonies , pictures , poems , are not pretty things , few are entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are meant to provoke a cataclysmic purge that leaves you weak , and only later gives strength . Old art , moreover , loses this power over all but the most imaginative beholders . When Dante heard about Paolo and Francesca , he fainted ; but the modern reader does not faint , he says : ' How sweet ! ' We need new art to shock us into life , and in the most cultured countries , too much old art stands in the way . War is our great chance to get rid of old art , but we deliberately miss the opportunity . Our love of art does not spring from zest for fife but from library science : we are curators , not creators . " He might add that we teach so well what is in the books that we do n't understand his or any other work ; and he would point out that ninety-nine in a hundred of those highly talented people we encourage have no connection with art whatever ? with art as he conceives and executes it . j UST , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " technically interesting , " and " favorably received , " it lacks the virtue of high art . Even the " modern " is now quickly conventionalized and meaningless . Al ! this near-art has virtues which should continue to command our attention and enlist our aid . It gives pleasure to maker and beholder alike , it maintains an industry of helpers , and it is certainly an innocent pastime and subject of conversation for the community . But it does not signify . What is said , if anything , has been said before , and it grows less true with each repetition . This verdict may sound unwarrantably hostile to the efforts of many able people who work hard to spread the taste for intellectual and artistic pleasures . One seems to stand by and blow upon a good deed . But this appearance is misleading . To begin with , I am one of those good people and my remarks are ? as they should he ? a piece of self-examination . In the second place , I continue to assert the value of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their true nature . And in the third place , I seek to strengthen our present efforts by pointing to the general lowering of tone which may come from the multiplication of opportunities and the consequent division of attention . V I FIND it admirable that anyone who has the taste and . twenty-five cents in his pocket can go into a Woolworth and buy a good reproduction of an Impressionist masterpiece . I am delighted that thanks to the recording companies , FM broadcasting , and mass-produced radios , I can tune in on virtually the whole repertory of Western music ? something that no previous generation had access to . But at the same time I note that these facilities encourage habits inimical to art and the artistic experience . Because art is " fun " and for enjoyment instead of distant lip service , we now take it like soda pop , anywhere , any time , in meaningless little gulps . We have hits of the Ninth Symphony trickling into our ears as we sit at the lunch counter . We overhear " Hamlet " as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung with reproductions of Van Gogh . Where in all this are we in touch with the secrets of life and death ? We do not even find continuity , or silence , or presence of mind . It is bad enough that we should use great art for teaching and therapy , for relieving the boredom of clerks and raising the output of workmen . All this erodes the soil in which artistic perception should grow . The masterpiece may not suffer , but we do . I have already heard artists complain that this diffusion of works makes for diffuseness of response . We grow dull , not bright , by addiction ; and the artist himself , too widely drawn upon , is drained in small change of his fund of power . It seems impossible to resistthe conclusion that what we have done is to encourage the arts , the output of artifacts , not an artist . Yet before we get too despondent , let us remember that high art blows where it listeth and that we might as foolishly complain of having not enough saints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each every fifty years is a high average . At the same time , we naturally ask ourselves whether we are doing all we can to create the conditions of high art . As regards the material conditions , I am quite sure we are the chances are about even that we will and that we will not recognize the master when he comes and give him his daily bread . What matters more is that we may be spreading a view of art that is in direct opposition to his work . Whatever words we use , we propagate the " technical " view , by which I do not mean to discount technique in great work . I should perhaps say we spread the " artistic " view of art . The more we think that " real life " is no good but " fine art " is good , the more we undermine the meaning of art itself . The more we stress the harmonious , the decorative , the satisfying in art , the less we are likely to be ready for the sublime and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ; they have no use for art as an end . They are not cultivated people in the approved style . They squint at the canvas so that they can see life straight , and it is the mastery of life that enthralls them in their own or any other work . A people of artists is therefore a contradiction in terms ? national suicide . For what in my definition I called the contemplation of life and death is not to be understood as thinking noble abstractions or gazing at allegorical nudes . Life and death are buying and selling and winning and losing and aching and laughing ; only , these vulgar things are to be seen in the light of , in the heat of , the deep-lying energies of desire , fear , and hope . Since most of us , being civilized , lack the power to see and feel these things directly , we seek them in translation , in high art . ow if in conclusion we want to know what we are actually accomplishing in our American Drang nach Kultur , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in very democratic fashion and with excellent taste , the treasure of high art laid up since the Renaissance . To everybody who will stand still five minutes we give a glimpse of the picture , the song , or the sonnet that is handy . All our mechanized media are turning out a sort of endless hot dog made out of certified pure and nourishing art . Shakespeare and Michelangelo come out of the movies chopped up but in a new skin . By contact with this , our population is , I will not say inspired , but in its own words , stimulated , excited . The acceptance of the idea of culture , the skill of the hand or eye , the pleasure of messing with paint or instruments ? all these things are being disseminated as a national endowment . We practice cultural democracy . Clearly we have no other course but to keep pushing in the same directions until we have assimilated over a wide surface all we can of the Western heritage . Then perhaps , on this soil or another , so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop and there will arise , by opposition and defiance , a new abundant crop of artistic revolutionists who will say , Away with all that ! They will dig through culture down to life and perhaps create art . In the interim we are transmitters . We resemble the old Romans , who also were organizers and collectors of the rich cultures to the east of them . Since it is wise to play one 's historical role with courage and without repining , transmitters let us be , our virtues : strength and high fidelity .
