About seven years ago Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed machine tools with small mechanical brains that take their orders from punched paper tapes . Needing no human help , they eliminated the jobs of many human operators , but as compensation , they created jobs for mathematicians to put their instructions in the number language that their brains understand . Last week M.I.T. demonstrated a second step : it had developed a gimmick to dump the mathematicians . <P> The trick was done by inventing an " English-like language " that any good machinist can learn and that a computer can translate into the numerical language of the machines ' tapes . A draftsman makes a detailed drawing of the part wanted . A part programer studies it carefully and writes orders for the machine tool in APT ( Automatically Programed Tool ) language . This language is not decorative . A simple example : " ON KUL , ON <P> SPN , GO RGT , TL LFT , CIRCLE/CTR AT , + 2 , + 3 , RADIUS , + 5 . " Meaning : " Turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool on left side along circle whose center is at x= +2 , y = +3 , with a radius of+5 . " This language is translated by a large computer that has been fed a set of cards punched with the APT grammar and vocabulary , thus has " learned " APT language . After it has read the APT instructions , the computer tests its solution with a blip of light that appears on a screen and goes through the motions that the machine tool is expected to make . If no corrections are needed , the computer spits out a tape carrying the orders translated into number language . The tape is fed into the tool 's mechanical brain , and without further human guidance , the tool forthwith turns out the part that the designer dreamed up .
