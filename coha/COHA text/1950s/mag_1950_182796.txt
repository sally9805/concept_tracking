Following hallowed tradition , the University of Glasgow 's 7,000 students piled out last week for one of the biggest rags of their undergraduate lives . Boys &; girls donned dungarees , pulled on their shabbiest shirts and football jerseys . Then they crowded into the quadrangle , shouted and shoved , tossed fishheads about , along with such oddments as catsup , rotten fruit and bags of soot . They roared irreverent chants about their retiring rector : " Walter Elliot* has a big , beery nose . . . " <P> For Glasgow , it was the week to elect a new rector-a distinguished man from public life whose job it will be for the next three years to represent students on the university court ( Glasgow 's administrative head is known as the principal ) . Following a tradition dating from 1858 , the students did the nominating , voting and , mixing national and university politics freely , most of the campaigning , too . Some of the candidates ' names bore their political tags : Sir David Maxwell Fyfe , Conservative ; onetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Independent ; Actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr. , Independent ; Actress Rosamond John , Independent , and Nationalist John MacCormick , the energetic leader of the Scottish Covenant movement , which for eight years has been demanding a Home Rule Scottish Parliament for domestic affairs . <P> " I Am Delighted . " Nationalist feeling was running high in favor of John MacCormick . But in the first stages of the campaign , when Douglas Fairbanks magnanimously withdrew in favor of Lord Inverchapel ( " I substantially share his views . . . " ) , it seemed as if his lordship might run away with the votes . <P> His backers put up by far the stiffest fight . The Inverchapel Committee published a pamphlet ( the Inverchapel Blast ) filled with blurbs from such notables as Journalist Barbara ( the Economist ) Ward , the King 's physician , U.S. General George C. Marshall ( " Inverchapel is a leader among peace-loving people . . . " ) and General Dwight D. Eisenhower ( " I am delighted ... Lord Inverchapel. . . friendly relations . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him ( candidates themselves never appear ) . Deadpan and in piping voice , Nicolson began : " Lord Inverchapel is extraordinarily unconventional . . . " Students burst into shouts of " at his age " and " whooooo . " <P> Scotches-Scot . On the big day the students ranged themselves according to their home districts , filed into the student union to cast their ballots . After a half-hour 's voting , the booths were closed to allow time for more shoving and throwing of fishheads . After 90 minutes of such relaxation , voting began again . At length , from the balcony above the main gate of University Building , Glasgow 's Principal Sir Hector Hetherington read out the results . The race had been close , but the Scotchest Scot of them all had won . Glasgow 's new Rector was John MacDonald MacCormick , leader of the Covenant . " Second : Lord Inverchapel . <P> " Without Marshall and Eisenhower , " said one Glaswegian , " Inverchapel might have done it-we Scots are awfu ' funny when it comes tae interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> * Tory M.P. , onetime Minister of Health in Neville Chamberlain 's cabinet .
