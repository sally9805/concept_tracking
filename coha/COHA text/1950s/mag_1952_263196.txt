The Nixon Fund <P> Sir : <P> It is discouraging , when we are trying so hard to send someone to clear up " the mess in Washington , " to find that one of the men we hoped could do that service seems to be insensitive to the very thing we want to have corrected ... It is no valid argument that some of the money has been used in a manner to save the taxpayers . We taxpayers are able and willing to pay for honest government in Washington . To call a simple publication of the facts regarding the " Nixon Fund " a Communist-inspired smear compounds rather than relieves the Senator 's offense . <P> GEORGE H. SHULL <P> Princeton , NJ . <P> Sir : <P> ... As one of Mr. Nixon 's constituents , I should like to protest against a phase of the situation unconnected with the current campaign . In the light of this revelation , I can not feel that Mr. Nixon represents me or the farmers in the San Joaquin Valley or the people in small northern California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hope Senator Nixon 's successor in the Senate will be a Senator from California and not a special emissary from Pasadena . <P> J. C. SMITH <P> Arcadia , Calif . <P> Governor " Soapy " <P> Sir : <P> Should you receive letters of criticism because of your article TIME , Sept. 15 on Michigan 's great governor , G. Mennen Williams , pay no attention . You will know that it is a synthetic response , carefully organized by the Republican State Central Committee and not from the heart of the people . . . Governor Williams is extremely popular and will in all probability be reelected . <P> HOWARD H. CHURCHILL <P> Imlay City , Mich . <P> Sir : <P> The people of Michigan are indeed fortunate to have Williams as their governor . We in Texas would willingly trade our Shivering ( Tidelands ) Shivers for Soapy Williams . <P> CHADWICK E. WILSON <P> Wichita Falls , Texas <P> Sir : <P> With my quoted words appearing out of full context as they do , the tone of the last paragraph of your story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a close associate in his formative years , have lost confidence in his integrity and even may have abandoned my sincere personal friendship for him . It was certainly not my intention to convey that impression . . . <P> STANDISH BACKUS JR . <P> Santa Barbara , Calif . <P> Sir : <P> If Williams ever becomes President , I am going to bid America adieu , and set sail for Lower Patagonia on a cake of Ivory soap . <P> JOSEPH P. FORD <P> Wolfeboro , N.H. <P> How Long , O Bogie ? <P> Sir : <P> In your issue of Sept. 22 , I read with pleasure that Lauren Bacall has switched from Ike to Adlai and that she is working on Bogie . <P> The great issue of the campaign has now been made . All red-blooded American men await the decision ! How long can Bogie hold out ? <P> THOMAS B. SAWYER <P> San Pedro , Calif . <P> They Like Ike , But ... <P> Sir : <P> I like TIME and I like Ike , but I feel as though you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first few pages of the Sept. 15 issue , I note nine columns devoted to Eisenhower and just two to Stevenson . <P> Are n't you overdoing it ? <P> JANE E. ROMEYN <P> Schenectady , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir :
