Oliver Twist ( J. Arthur Rank ; United Artists ) , delayed for two years in its U.S. showing because of pressure-group charges that it fosters antiSemitism , can be seen at last by U.S. moviegoers for what it is : a brilliant , fascinating movie , no less a classic than the Charles Dickens novel which it brings to life . Indeed , in mirroring Dickens and his illustrator , Cruikshank , the picture is faithful to a fault-hence the ruckus . Its faithfully repulsive portrait of Fagin offended some Jewish groups , who protested that the film would drum up anti-Semitism and succeeded in blocking its U.S. release ( TIME , Oct. 4 , 1948 ) . <P> Yet the movie treats Fagin consistently as an individual ( as Dickens did ) , never as a group symbol or scapegoat ; it is obviously not anti-Semitic by design , and few are likely to find it anti-Semitic in effect . Attempts to suppress it , raising the issue of precensorship v. a free screen , brought many Jews to the picture 's defense . The keepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February , contented themselves with the gesture of cutting out ten minutes of Fagin 's close-ups and profiles . <P> Oliver Twist is long ( 1 hr. 45 min. ) and rich enough to spare the cuts . Directed by David Lean and produced by Ronald Neame , the British team responsible for 1947 's superb Great Expectations , the movie recreates the novel 's pungent brew of harshly realistic detail , extravagant melodrama , sordid depravity and sentimental warmth . Between the dreary , bare-brick expanse of the parish workhouse where Oliver begins life as an orphan and the elegant Brownlow mansion where he finally takes his rightful place , the settings and costumes summon up all but the smells of Britain 's lower depths in the early 1800s : " the cold , wet , shelterless midnight streets of London ; the foul and frowsy dens , where vice is closely packed and lacks the room to turn ; the haunts of hunger and disease ; the shabby rags that scarcely hold together . " <P> Director Lean , who wrote the script with Stanley Haynes , has trimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , juggled a few incidents for dramatic effect , but salvaged much of Dickens ' original dialogue . Yet Oliver Twist is more than an intelligent adaptation ; it is a major creative effort by one of the few directors who has mastered his medium . <P> Unusually flexible in his cutting and camera movement , Lean has translated some of the novel 's long passages ( e.g. , Oliver 's birth and workhouse ordeal , Bill Sikes 's remorse over the murder of Nancy ) into virtually wordless sequences of visual storytelling at its imaginative best . He has molded most of his actors in the image of the Cruikshank drawings and handled them with the controlled flamboyance of Novelist Dickens himself . If any one threatens to outshine the others , it is Alec ( The Cocktail Party ) Guinness in the horrendous make-up of Fagin . To the character 's sly , rancid evil , he adds a subtle tinge of homosexuality , an interpretive touch neither confirmed nor contradicted by the Dickens text .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
