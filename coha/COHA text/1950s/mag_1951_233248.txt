In a Hollywood parking lot one evening last week , a jealous husband waited for his wife to return from , a drive with another man . After the big Cadillac convertible pulled to a stop , the attendant heard the woman pleading and the man 's startled voice : " Do n't be silly , Walter . Do n't ! " Then there were two shots . One bullet from the husband 's pistol smashed into the Cadillac 's tail fin . The other struck the suspected rival in the groin . <P> Even before the wounded man got to the hospital , the news was on Page One , and even the most cynical Hollywood moviemakers reacted with a cold chill of alarm . This was no Payton-Tone free-for-all , ' or Gardner-Sinatra burlesque . This time the triangle revolved around some of Hollywood 's shiniest showpieces . The husband : Dartmouth man Walter Wanger ( rhymes with Grainger ) , 57 , noted producer ( Stagecoach , Algiers ) and former Academy Award president . Walter Wanger had been on the financial skids since his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went into bankruptcy for $175,000 . But he was still a man whose name stood for respectability , culture and the intellectual values at the crossroads of Sunset and Vine . The wife : Actress Joan Bennett , 41 , beauteous screen grandmother and one of Hollywood 's prime exhibits in the campaign to prove that virtue and glamour can be synonymous . Third in the triangle : Actress Bennett 's agent , Jennings Lang , 39 , oldtime friend of the family , who frequently accompanied his client on business trips around the country . <P> Full Briefcase . While Hollywood 's brass fidgeted with dismay , Wanger did nothing to set matters aright . From a jail cell , he coldly explained that he had long suspected Lang of having more than an agent 's interest in his wife . In Manhattan last winter , he said , he had warned Lang : " I 'll shoot anyone who tries to break up my home . " Last week , with a briefcase full of private detective 's reports , he decided the time had come to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hush the scandal . " Knowing Hollywood as I do , " she declared with conscientious concern , " knowing how good , wholesome and sincere the majority of motion picture people are , I deeply regret that this incident will add to the erroneous opinion of Hollywood shared by so many . " There was no romance , she said . Her ride with Agent Lang was a business conference and they had simply used the car to escape the jangling telephones in his office . The sorry affair was simply the result of Wan-ger 's business troubles : " I hope that Walter will not be blamed too much . He has been very unhappy and upset for many months because of money worries . " <P> Smash Wind-Up . But the story was too big to stop . Hardly had Actress Bennett finished her appearance as the forgiving wife when Husband Wanger , released on bail , turned up at home , packed up his belongings and moved out to a bachelor 's apartment . In the hospital Lang maintained a stony silence , refused to press charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would bring the case to trial just the same , and Hollywood shuddered again . <P> The whole thing , said one worried publicity director , " is just the smash wind-up of Movietime , U.S.A. " - the public-relations festival designed , among other things , to convince the country that Hollywood is just like Main Street anywhere .
