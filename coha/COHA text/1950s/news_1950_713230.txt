txt It is high time , it seems to us , that those members of Congress who are trying to hitch a free political ride on the pending tax bill cease their obstructionist tactics or be accorded the rebuke by their colleagues that these tactics so abundantly warrant . We refer to those who insist on tying an excess profits tax  --  and particularly their pet version of such a tax  --  onto the legislation as the price of their support . The devotees of the E. P. T. in the Senate got about all the mileage out of this issue , it would seem , that it was possible to expect . In that Chamber some members wanted to write such a provision into the measure on the floor , but Senator Walter George , chief helmsman for the Finance Committee 's bill , vigorously opposed the idea . Senator George is not opposed to the principle of taxing away windfall war profits ( nor , for that matter , are many other people ) , but he pointed out that the proposed amendment , though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a true wartime excess profits tax at all . He would , he said , support an excess profits tax , but only if it was " one that he could honestly defend " and only after the people who would have to pay the tax had been given an opportunity to be heard . Senator George then proceeded to give incontestable earnest of his and his associates ' good faith in the matter . He agreed to an amendment which directed the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee to bring out excess profits legislation at the next session of Congress ( when the second defense revenue bill is scheduled for action ) and ' to make that tax retroactive to Oct. 1 , this year . That certainly should have been all the assurance that any reasonable person could have wished , and the Senate did , indeed , accept it as such , by voting its approval of the bill . Now it appears , however , that certain members of the House still believe they can squeeze a few drops of political nutriment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meeting the cost of the defense program by " soaking the profiteers . " Although President Truman has flatly stated that action on the highly controversial excess profits tax should be put over until 1951 , and although the pending bill , as noted above , carries a directive providing for such a tax on a retroactive basis , Representative Eberharter of Pennsylvania has just let it be known that he means to block immediate House action on the $4,508 , - 000,000 bill . As we have pointed out before , there is no issue here of whether our corporations or anyone else is to be permitted to turn a potential war emergency to his material advantage . Everyone is going to have to pitch in , so far as taxes are . concerned , if the present defense effort is to be put on a pay-as-you-go basis . The established , and sensible , practice is for Congress to *vote ; without unnecessary ? delay , a general increase in existing taxes . That is exactly what the pending " interim " measure does , raising taxes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration of other possible sources of emergency revenue . ' Arguments that it is necessary to attach an excess profits tax to the pending bill to prevent " inflation " and " profiteering " are purely political . In the first place , corporations do n't have to raise prices to profit from a boom , whether it is a peacetime or a war phenomenon . The era of the nation 's greatest corporate prosperity , in the Twenties , was a period of steadily falling prices . ( The post-World War I boom of 1919-20 occurred , incidentally , at a time when an excess profits tax was atillin force . ) In the second place corporations that . wished to ' raise prices would not be likely to be seriously deterred by the . consideration that this might involve a tax payment at some time in the future . Furthermore , since the economy has not yet felt the impact of . the post-Korean rearmament program , there can hardly be any profits directly attributable to the war in the immediate future . And , finally , the legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of next month on will be covered by the excess profits provision of the second ( 1951 ) defense revenue bill . We are as intolerant as anyone when it comes to wartime profiteering ; in fact , in one respect we are perhaps more intolerant than some . We object to wartime profiteering of any kind , even when it takes the form of political profiteering .
