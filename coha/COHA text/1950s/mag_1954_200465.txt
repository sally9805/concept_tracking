One day last week , a Washington-bound airliner put down at Memphis and Lawyer Samuel Sears , a ruddy , pipe-smoking Bostonian with a grey Homburg , natty bow tie and wispy mustache , stepped out for a breath of fresh air . A reporter rushed up to him asking : " Pardon me , sir , but are you the Australian ambassador ? " <P> He was not , but what he was made him of far greater interest to the U.S. newspaper-reading public : he had just been named the Mundt committee counsel , the man who would direct the investigation of the row between Joe McCarthy and the U.S. Army . <P> An In-Law 's Help . Acting Committee Chairman Karl Mundt , in his three-week search for a counsel , had said , " This job is seeking the man ; the man should n't seek the job . " But Sam Sears was no worm to hide in that old chestnut . He telephoned his Congressman , Boston 's Laurence Curtis , to say that he was available . Curtis told Massachusetts ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington 's Democratic Senator Henry M. " Scoop " Jackson , a committee member , to locate Sears and invite him to Washington . <P> Meanwhile , in Oklahoma , Sears 's son-in-law David Busby , a local Democratic politico , proposed Sears 's name to Democratic Senator Mike Monroney . Monroney 's endorsement helped make up Jackson 's mind in Sears 's favor . <P> <P> After meeting with the committee , Sears held a press conference , where he was asked if he had expressed opinions on " McCarthy or McCarthyism . " Said Sears : " Not publicly , and not privately . " <P> Newsmen promptly found that in 1952 Sears had said McCarthy " has done a great job . . . Why , there would be 200 more Communists in the Government if it was n't for McCarthy . " The record of a debate last fall with Harvard Professor Mark Howe showed that Sears had argued : " If ridding the Government of hundreds of traitors ... is called McCarthyism , then I am glad it has a place in the dictionary . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question ; he thought it referred only to the case of McCarthy v. the Army , and not McCarthy generally . Committee Democrats did not like this answer , wanted Chairman Mundt to drop Sears , start looking for a more candid lawyer . <P> Toothpicks &; Jalopies . Samuel Powers Sears , 58 ( remote kin of " Bobo " Paul Sears Rockefeller ) , comes from a Cape Cod seafaring family whose heritage he upholds as commodore of the Dennis ( Mass . ) Yacht Club . At Harvard ( ' 17 ) , Sam turned his musical talent into Hasty Pudding shows-tunes by Sears , words by Robert Sherwood . The pair worked in a musty office , where young Sherwood hung his portrait among those of the great poets , while Sam 's was flanked by pictures of Bach , Beethoven and Mozart . Sam can still pound out lively barroom piano music , but with maturity , he has acquired a greater fancy for collecting old cars and gold toothpicks . <P> Sears built a reputation as an able trial lawyer specializing in defending claims against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1952 , a candidate of the Taft forces , he made an abortive bid for the Republican gubernatorial nomination against Congressman ( now Governor ) Christian Herter.
