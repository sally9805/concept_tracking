Michigan 's Democratic Governor G. Mennen ( " Soapy " ) Williams cleaned up last week in the biennial spring elections for lesser state and county offices traditionally held by Republicans . Soapy stumped the state personally , staking in the campaign his prestige , and plentiful cash ( donated by the United Auto Workers ) . On election day the Democrats took Detroit two to one , won five of the eight state offices at stake , swamped the Republican state slate for the first time in a spring election since 1933 . Afterwards , the Detroit Times sized up ambitious young ( 44 ) Soapy : " The strongest leader his party has had in this century in Michigan . "
