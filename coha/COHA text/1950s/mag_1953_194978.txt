Twenty-three years ago this month , a youthful-looking Seventh-Day Adventist preacher stood up before his small and struggling congregation in South Los Angeles to appeal for funds . " Now , brethren , " he said , " I 've been telling you for some time that God wants me on radio . . . I want you to prove that I 'm not lying and that I do know what God wants . " A collection of rings , watches and old jewelry netted just enough to put the Rev. Harold M. S. Richards on the air the next week . He has been broadcasting steadily ever since . <P> By now , Evangelist Richards ' Voice of Prophecy program has become an international production , broadcast in eleven languages over 845 stations . There is a no-man staff at work in the Voice 's Glendale headquarters , and one of Richards ' weekly sermons draws an average 14,000 letters from his world audience . After the Lutheran Hour ( carried by more than 1,000 stations ) , the Adventists ' program is the most widely heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " Broadcaster Richards , 58 , is a friendly , hard-working man with a habit of calling everybody " brother . " His father was also an Adventist evangelist , and Harold got his start at 17 , preaching at Adventist " campaigns , " i.e. , revival meetings , in the U.S. and Canada . His first parish was a tiny , tar-papered church in Ottawa , where he boosted the congregation from 8 to 120 . <P> Back in the U.S. , he took his wife on the road with him , through long preaching campaigns , mostly in California . In 1928 , at Fresno , he campaigned for nine months straight . He preached for 45 minutes seven nights a week , for the whole time . ( " Man alive , we had a number of big baptisms out of that one . " ) <P> Adventist authorities took a dim view of Richards ' radio program at first . But by 1937 it was going so well that Pacific Coast officials of the church urged him to put the Voice on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him , Richards began preaching on a national hookup ( Mutual ) , and the next year began to line up foreign stations . <P> Noah Was Warned . Through the years , the formula for Voice of Prophecy has changed very little . Evangelist Richards steers clear of specific Adventist dogma , * concentrates instead on basic talks about the Bible , interspersed with oldtime hymns sung by the King 's Heralds , a male quartet . He knows his Bible well-he has read it cover to cover 31 times-and his sermons are highly concrete discussions of the Bible 's application to daily life . Says he : " We believe that there are things in the Bible that prophesy what is happening today and that tell of the coming of the Kingdom of God . . . God does n't let the world get caught napping , brother . Look how he warned Noah . He has warned us and it 's in the Bible . " <P> To encourage Bible study by his listeners , Richards runs three free correspondence courses in religion , one for children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of each lesson , which is then sent in for grading .
