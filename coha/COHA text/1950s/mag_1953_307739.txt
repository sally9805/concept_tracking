Five years after the Communists seized power in Czechoslovakia in the name of the working class , the Czech workers got caught in one of the great swindles of modern times . They listened dazedly on May 30 as their masters proclaimed " currency reforms " wiping out most of their savings , repudiating the state bonds they had been forced to buy , and cutting their wages almost 70% ( TIME , June 8 ) . The next day they acted without plan , without leadership or premeditation . What they did will be long remembered . <P> The most complete report of what happened came not from the usual " well-informed sources " but from the Reds ' own Pravda of Pilsen , center of the giant Lenin ( formerly Skoda ) Works . It was written in Communist doubletalk , but remarkably candid for all that : " On June 1 , some politically unaware workers let themselves be persuaded into believing that the currency reform was aimed at them , and that they would not be able to live on their new wages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town hall rioters tore down pictures of Czech state leaders and hung up pictures of the imperialist agent Benes the last non-Communist President . The American gangsters stepped on pictures of Stalin and Gottwald and violated the Soviet flag . The archives in the town hall were burned . <P> " On the night of June 3-4 , firing was heard . On June 4-5 , armed militia marched through the streets and machine guns were placed before the Lenin factories and government buildings . . . Workers in the Lenin Works did not stop the reactionary elements in time , something that must never be allowed to happen again . " <P> From Ostrava , in the Czech Ruhr , Nova Svoboda reported : " At Vaclav , Zone , Czechoslovak Pioneer Mines , Bohumin Iron Works and the Stalingrad Iron Works in Liskovec , some workers let themselves be misled by provocateurs in the service of the bourgeoisie . . . Considerable unrest and provocations took place . . . State and labor discipline was seriously disturbed . . . Loyal workers liquidated the subversive activities . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more went on ? Radio Free Europe , just across the Czech frontier , painstakingly analyzed reports by travelers and refugees and filled out the story . <P> A refugee : " Miners in the Ostrava pits went on strike for five days ; the soldiers refused to fire on them . Convinced Communists tore party emblems from their lapels , spat on them . Plant militia killed three miners . One militiawoman who shot a miner was beaten to death . " <P> A German mechanic sent to Prague to service machinery : " Prague was blocked by troops , the capital was in a state of siege , factory workers were in an uproar . One worker told me in German : ' We do n't care what happens to us ; we are tired of the propaganda , the swindle . If we do n't get our salary , we will stop working . ' "
