Well , It Was This Way By GARY COOPER as told to George Scullin PART ONE The way things added up that day , what with the horse , the film and the camera- man , my first production cost me every cent I had . It was n't a big production , but that sixty-five dollars in cash was not easily come by , Yet it was all or nothing , and nothing , in the year 1925 , did n't appeal to me at all . If I had known then what that Poverty Row production was to do for me in Hollywood , I think I would have stayed aboard my rented horse and kept right on going . Because this was the fork in the road , the place where everything began for me. 1 was sinking my life savings into this film footage for several reasons . The biggest of these was that after only six months in the movies , I had reached my peak as a spectacular faller-off of horses . Whether I was an Indian with Richard Dix , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mix , my part had a certain sameness . When the time came for someone to be shot from a galloping Horse , I was usually the one who took the tumble , often into a gulch filled with rock and prickly-pear cactus . As I.saw it , my future was limited to riding meaner horses at faster speeds into deeper gulches until my luck ran out and I busted up like an orange crate . Another reason for making a change was based on a rumor that Tom Mix was making Si 7,500 a week . That 's what some cowboy extras said , and it convinced me that there was more money in the movie business than the ten bucks a day I was being paid . To get away from failing off horses and into the more profitable side of acting , I first had to have a screen test . But nobody would give me one , and I could n't use any of the takes from the quickie pictures in which I had fallen off horses . The great rider , Slim Talbot , told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , but you sureput on the best imitation of a tornadoed windmill I ever did see . " In one scene I did have a close brush with fame when they let me pat Rin-Tin-Tin , but it was a night scene , and we were on the far side of a dim campfire . Only the crown of my white hat showed , and it was n't really Rin-Tin-Tin anyway . It was his stand-in . For a while I tried softening up producers by sending them stills pointing up my uncanny resemblance to Valentino , John Barrymore , Ronald Colman , Francis X. Bushman or any other star of their choice . I did n't even get my stills back . They 'd been thrown away . The loss cost me money , but not much . A short time before , I had worked as a door-to-door salesman for a photographer who specialized in " intimate portraits of children in your own home . " We had failed in this field , but he still gave me portraits at a discount . At this low point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one else would give me a screen test , why not produce my own ? Fortunately , I had no worries then about paying for sound tracks . My only expenses were rental of the horse and a fee for an **31;415;TOOLONG who counted my money before loading film in his camera . Now for my production . Because this was 1925 , my location was the wide-open range atthe corner of 3rd Street and La Brea . I was mounted on my rented horse on the far side of a vacant lot , and the cameraman was behind a rail fence . He waved his hand . Action ! Camera ! I gave the poor nag a belt and charged the camera . This was no time to spare the horse ? that film was costing money . Just before reaching the fence , I hauled back , made a flying dismount in a cloud of dust , leaped the fence , and in front of the camera I swept off my hat . For a close-up , I gave out with a ghastly grin . Cut ! When my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waters , director of Zane Grey Westerns for Paramount , and persuaded him to run the film through a projector . " It wo n't take long , " I told him . It did n't . That strip of film whipped through in about twenty seconds ? ten seconds of action and ten seconds of a big cloud of dust . Waters just sat there in a sort of stunned silence . Finally he turned tome and said , " I could n't sec what happened there at the end . Tell me , friend , did you climb over that fence or were you thrown ? " The scene popped up in my memory three years ago , when I was working on a picture down in Mexico . Between takes the talk got around to Stanley Kramer , and my part in his production of High Noon . The picture had done right well for itself , and for a young newcomer to the screen by the name of Grace Kelly . There was a rumor that it might win some Oscars on the night of the Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up your Oscar , Gary ? " Now , there was a thought . I had heard that I 'd been nominated for an award , but that 's a long way from winning . Still , just in case  --  the next day I ran into John Wayne winding up a fishing trip in Aca pulco . " Cotta get back to Hollywood for the Academy Awards , " he told me . So I left the matter in his hands . On Academy Award night I was listening to the doings over the radio , and the things said about me were getting pretty flowery until John Wayne came up to get my award . " I do n't know why Coop asked me to sub for him in picking up his Oscar , " he said , " but maybe it 's because we both got where we are by falling off horses . " Right then I remembered my sixty-five-dollar strip of film and its cloud of dust . Every man has a turning point in his life , and that test shot was mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , big money , hilarious moments and trouble . I 'm not complaining . But later on in this story I 'll have to do some explaining : about the rhinoceros that missed me , and the punches that did n't , and how I played at being a playboy in Rome , until the Italian cavalry got into the act even try to explain how my wife , Rocky , handles an cx-Montana cowpoke when he gets hard to live with . Yup , family secrets ! A lot of people have the impression that I am something of a Western-type actor , and that 's fine , because I like Westerns . But the fact is I like making all types of pictures that have something to say . One of the first of these , and one which I approached with respect , was Ernest Hemingway 's A Farewell to Arms . This was produced during the period that Hollywood still refers to in capital letters as The Advent of Sound . Sound did n't hit me too hard . As a born-in-Montana product , I came equipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some British overtones , picked up in three years at a public school in England , and Middle-American accents from three years at Grinnell College , in Iowa . I could talk , but , as hundreds of actors from the silent days were discovering , that was n't enough . You had to be real loud to make an impression on the insensitive , bucket-sized microphones used in the early days of sound . An ordinary speaking voice would enter one of those charcoal-filled mikes anJ drop dead . tut I was lucky . As a sclera ! ) hog and cattle caller , I could bellow louJ enough to knock the earphones off the sound engineer . When sound came in , Hollywood fired carloads of silent-screen stars , including some of my best friends . To replace them , carloads of talent were brought from Broadway . We veterans of the silent days VI ere reminded time and time again that these newcomers were " legitimate " actors . What that made us we could n't figure out . Among the legitimate actresses who came West was Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had a wonderful voice that could fill a theater with a whisper , and she knew that working to a camera three feet away was not the same as playing to the third balcony . In her very first picture , The Sin of Madelon Claudet , her performance so surpassed anything the talkies had done before that she won her Academy Award as best actress of the year . Now she was cast opposite me in A Farewell to Arms . She scared me to death . I learned later that Miss Hayes was scared of mc , too ; though not because of my acting ability . Just about then I was coming out of what my wife , Rocky , refers to as my wolfish period , and in newspapers around the country I had come to be known as the boy friend of Clara Bow , Lupe Velez or the Countess di Framo . I 'll come back to them later . While Miss Hayes still had reservations about the movies , she was not half so scared of the cameras as she was of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So both of us were frightened when we met for the first time in the office of Frank Borzagc , who was going to direct us in the picture . How do you do , Miss Hayes ? How do you do , Mr. Cooper ? Frank saw how thick the ice was , and it did n't make him happy . When actors do n't hit it off , you often get what is called " a cold set , " and pretty soon the whole cast is choosing up sides for a feud . Love scenes that should be played warmly come up coated with frost , and fight scenes have sometimes ended in general carnage . In this emergency Frank moved fast . " Now that you two have met , " he said , " I want you to get into your costumes and meet me in the portrait studio . The publicity department wants stills so they can start their build-up . " Ordinarily , putting on a costume helps to take me out of myself , but this time it did n't work . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry , I was still a scared ranch boy from Montana named Gary Cooper . When Miss Hayes appeared a moment later , dressed as she nurse , Catherine Barkley , she had n't changed much either . " O.K. ! Fine , " said Frank . " You look wonderful . Now here 's the setup . We 've got a great war story , and we 've got a great love story . We ca n't shoot the war here , so we 'll shoot the incidentals . " He pushed us into several cozy poses , where we stood rigidly . I towered a foot over Miss Hayes . We could n't see eye to eye at all , unless she stood on tiptoe and I slouched down . In the meantime Frank was buzzing around the set , and at last , as though he had n't had it in mind all along , he discovered a prop couch . " Halt ! " he said . " Here 's one . . . . Now you , Miss Hayes " ( his voice all respect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you " ( a jerk of the thumb to indicate mc , the relic from the silent days ) " can stretch out beside her .... Closer , for heaven 's sake ! After all , this is supposed to be a love scene . " He stuck his head under the black hood of the camera . What he saw on the ground glass was a couple of lovers looking about as amorous as dueling porcupines . " Closer , " he urged . " Come on ! Clinch ! " At last we approximated the hold he wanted . But he was taking an awfully long time to snap the shutter . Finally he just sighed and stepped out from under the hood . " Miss Hayes , " he said in a choked voice , " that scene is so beautiful I think VII shoot the whole picture horizontally . " We looked at each other , did a double take and began to laugh . One laugh led to another , and while we did n't exactly get down and roll on the floor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Farewell to Anra was too sensitive a picture to be shot on a cold set . Well , that was Frank Borzage . Now let me tell you of an opposite experience I had with another director  --  Josef von Sternberg . This was during the filming of Nits rocco , in 1930 . Marlene Dietrich was the leading lady in this . She had just recently arrived in Hollywood after her triumph in Blue Angel , the famous German-made film . Morocco was her first American picture , and von Sternberg was out to sec that she made good . Within the first hour of shooting I could see problems ahead . First , he directed almost entirely in German ; I did n't understand a word . Second , he was intro ? during ingenious camera effects never seen in Hollywood before . It was bad enough not knowing what he was talking about , but I did n't even know what was going on , After a couple of days , I began to feel that von Sternberg was not seeing me as the costar , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then to help show Miss Dietrich at her best . Under this treatment what confidence I had in my acting began sinking fast . Luckily I had Adolphe Menjou supporting me , if not holding me completely t so I asked him for advice . Adolphe is a loyal son of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , and Cornell University , in Upstate New York . His ability to wear a tailor-made suit or a rakish uniform is world famous , and in 1930 he was also famous as the smoothest , most sophisticated villain in the businus . What is not so well known is that he is an intellectual , a master of six languages . He understood German and had an idea of what von Sternberg was trying to do . " I do n't seem to be getting anywhere , " I told him , as if that was news . " What do I do ? " " Gary , " he said , " acting is a lot of things . Sometimes clothes set off the man , and sometimes it takes a man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting is no more complicated than the ability to wear a hat . " Now you , " he continued , pointing to my French Foreign Legion cap , " you can wear a cap or anything else . There 's not a headgear made for man anywhere in the world that you ca n't wear as though it were made to order for you . " I could see that here was a priceless compliment to my training , intelligence , hard work and ) perseverance . Just what did the donning of a tarboosh , a pith helmet , a derby or Foreign Legion cap have to do with my success , as an actor ? Hunting for encouragement in Adolphe 's words , of which I was in real need , I gave them as liberal a meaning as I could . What he meant , I told myself , was that I was becoming an actor . I might not be able to play the whole character , but at least I had got to the point where I could put on the character 's hat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on von Sternberg , which was not easy . He directed with a strong hand . A The Coopers : Gary , his I8-year-old daughter , Maria , and wife , " Roe ky , " at Southampton , L. I. , last summer . carpenter hammering while von Sternberg was thinking might be fired on the spot . And he had a habit of compelling the whole cast to stand around him in hushed silence while he coached Miss Dietrich in German . In one of those meetings I saw my chance . I opened my mouth wide and yawned . An actress gasped . Adolphe grinned- Von Sternberg stopped , pawed the air a minute , and then continued . I yawned again . About the fourth yawn , with von Sternberg 's collar shrinking to the choking point , he let me have it in perfect English . " Well , " I said politely , " if you would speak in English all the time , I 'm sure I could stay awake . " The ceiling was too high to hit , but he tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next day was touch better . He even threw , us underlings a word or two of English to help us along . I congratulated myself on having won a major victory . With Adolphe coaching me on the art of acting , we knocked ourselves out to make Morocco a success . It was too , Billboards all over the countr ? announced its coming . Full pages were taken in newspapers and magazines . I can see them yet : MOROCCO ! MARLENE Dtsrnicis ! Down in the lower right hand corner of the ads was a faint line that under a magnifying glass turned out to be type . It read : " with gory cooper and adolphe menjou . " Von Sternberg had had his last word , and it was n't in German , either . One day Morocco was shown at a movie house near the Bennett School for Girls in Millbrook , New York , and several students went over to catch it . One of them , Veronica Balk , read the credit line that listed me as one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen was a romantic hero , and he made a better first impression on Miss Balk than I could have done in person ; and for that I 'm grateful . Miss Balk met my shadow in Moroccia and it was through my shadow that I was able to meet her in ptnaon . She has been Mrs. Gary Cooper ever since . My wife , known to all our friends as Rocky , has formed her own theory on my acting ability . Her theory is based on the possibility that I am an artist  --  a painter and sketcher . Therefore , she says , I am sensitive to character , mood and color . I can go along with her theory part of the way , because my wish to be art artist goes back a long way . I was nine years old , maybe ten , when I discovered art in all its glory . I remember I was wearing knee pants at the time , and long black stockings , and button shoes . For garters I wore a kind of harness which ran over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my stocking tops . Anyway , on this day 11 had gone down to the Montana State Capitol where dad was a judge of the Supreme Court . Halfway through the great hall I was stopped , really nailed in my tracks , by the sight of a great mural . It showed explorers , Indians and horses , and every one of them seemed ready to pick right up and move past me . I was looking at Charles Russell 's painting of Lewis and Clark at Ross Hole , Years later I discovered that the mural is one of Russell 's masterpieces , but all I knew then , as a youngster , was that I 'd give anything to be able to paint like that . But my opportunities to become a painter were limited . First I became the victim of an undeclared war between the boards of education in Montana and England . It began when my mother decided that growing up in Montana was turning me and my brother , Arthur , into wild Indians . She carted us off to England and put us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headmaster sniffed at my third-grade report card . He said I was weak in Latin , French and English history , and I 'd have to catch up . Three years later I returned to Helena , Montana . My English education barely qualified me for picking up where I had left off in the third grade . While 1 was working my way through that setback , World War I came along . Every able-bodied cowboy went off to fight , including Arthur , who was six years older than I. Dad was tied up in the State Capitol helping keep Montana in operation . That left it up to mother and me to keep the ranch going . We ran about Goo head of cattle  --  beef for the A.E.F. Those two years on the ranch changed me . I went up there an the frail and puny side . Suddenly I found myself staring hungrily at steers on the hoof . I grew thirteen inches in thirteen months , and my belt did not have to be let out a single notch . Between eating , working , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for school . By the time the war was over and I could go back to school , the kids in the class I was supposed to join came up to my belt buckle . A teacher named Miss Wheeler came to my rescue . " You ca n't quit now , " she told me , bless her heart . " Tell you what you do . We make allowances here in Montana for ranch boys like you who miss some school . There are special art courses you can take here at Wesleyan that will get you into Montana State College in Bozeman by nest fall , and from there you can go anywhere . " While I was patching the holes in my education at Wesleyan , one of my best friends was Harvey Markham . Harvey had been hit with polio as a youngster , and left with paralyzed legs . His dad had fixed him up with a special Model T Ford he could control with his hands , and he became a very good driver . Each morning Harvey would pick me up and drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , and on this particular morning we were on the way down the steepest hill when Harvey applied the hi-nd brake . It did n't hold . Then he grabbed the two levers controlling the foot brake and the reverse pedal . They came off in his hand . I do n't know how fast we were going when we hit the corner at the bottom of the hill . We almost had it made when the front wheels jackknifed . The car just flipped . Harvey went through the canvas top on one side , and I went through on the other . Harvey was thrown clear and not damaged too much . I rolled on the ground while the car stood on its nose , and then the car rolled on me . We did n't have an X-ray machine , but the best doctors in town went over me and could find no broken bones . " Some torn ligaments in the hip , " they said . " Just stay in bed , and time will heal this . " But I could n't stay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restless that my tossing around was doing me more harm than good . Finally the doctors let me go up to the ranch for my convalescence . When hobbling on crutches became too painful , l eased around on a gentle colt , The doctors were all horsemen themselves , and they saw nothing in riding that might harm torn ligaments . My hip hurt me considerably , so I really learned how in ride . Up to then I had been a slam-bang , rodeo-type rider who could stick on anything that bucked , and I could punish the saddle for hours at a time . Now , with ow hip hurting me , I learned to anticipate the horse 's next move , and then his next , until I got to the point where I could ride at full gallop and instinctively know just about every step and mist that horse was going to make in the next hundred yards . Every time I was caught by surprise , a sharp twinge would strike my hip . something like the jab of a knife followed by a bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of watching my horse again . After a kw weeks of this kind of coaching , I was riding with an ease that no amount of training could have given me otherwise . At the time , this was n't important . What was important was that I had days and weeks to myself . No one expected me to work . I could read ? or draw , or paint , or just go off by myself . After a long ride in the mountains , moving around was painful , so I would sit quietly . After a while the deer would come out , and rabbits , skunks , quail , ptarmigan . I read by the hour , I sketched by the hour , and sometimes I just watched and thought by the hour . By she time I was walking straight again , my mind was made up . I would finish my schooling somewhere in the East , go on to study art in Chicago , and then become a painter of nature , using a style that would fall somewhere between the detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what I started out to be . The sequel to all this comes some years later . I had taken the usual bad spill for the cameras , but now that I was a movie star , I had to have tender care . Specialists , X rays and all that . They had me in a hospital bed with some mighty pretty nurses around when the bone specialist came by with his report . " 1-Em'rn , ? he said . " When did you break your hip ? " " Never did , - I said . He held up an X-ray plate of my hip showing a white crack going through it looking like the Grand Canyon . " A bad break , " he said . " Not so much knitted togethcr as filled in . Looks like you got it when you were a kid . What happened ? " I told him a car crash had torn some ligaments , but when I came to the part about going horseback riding after the spill , his eyes popped . PctiTpd ti'tcge. get it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . You had a major break , and you went horseback riding , and you kept open . ing the crack wider and wider , It 's a wonder you did n't fall through it . " Then he jumped Inc as though it was all my fault . " Mr. Cooper , do you know what we would do with you today if you had a break like that ? We would put you in traction and immobilize you fur weeks . " But suppose I had been put in traction Where would I have learned to ride with ease ? Where would I have got those weeks in the wilderness , the time to read and paint , and the time to form ambition ? There is a lot of talk about " getting the breaks " in the movies , but that busted hip of mine is the truest example I know of . Before I go any further , I ought to knock down the legend that when I 'm not acting I 'm tongue-tied . I 've been described for years as a man whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , I can bring up reliable witnesses like Robert Taylor or Ernest Hemingway , who will complain that on hunting and fishing trips I 'm so gabby I keep them awake all night . I can prove that there are other people in Hollywood who get along fine saying Ica than I do . First , I might as well admit that I like going to parties . I 'm not much of a social asset , but I Eike being around . And the parties I like best arc the ones we throw at our house . My wife , Rocky , is a wonderful hostess . She can make everyone feel right at home , including inc. which is going some . About three years after we were married , when we threw our first big party , 1 tried to help her as host . I was so anxious that everyone have a good time the gueso thought I was sick , and left Carly to give me some sleep . Now Rocky just puts a glass in my hand , nudges me into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big party , Rocky was worrying about Jimmy Stewart , a friend of ours . The same conversation that will cause gabby me to say " Yup " will bring only a nod of the head from Jimmy . He had been a long time single , and Rocky told me that a way ought to be found for him to meet a girl to marry . I could n't see her point . Jimmy could n't walk through an empty desert at midnight without being belted by proposals , But Rocky did n't think those proposals had Jimmy 's best interests at heart . Jimmy came , and so did the girl of Rocky 's choice , Gloria Hatt-kit McLean-Jimmy stood in one corner , shuffling his feet around with the rest of us dust kickers , and the girl stood in another corner . Every now and then Rocky broke away from her duties as hostess and made some excuse for dragging the pair together . It was a waste of time , as I could see . By the end of the evening , Jimmy 's total dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a single . Y. Yet Rocky was triumphant , " You just wait , " she told n We did not have long to wait . A few months later the Stewarts returned from their honeymoon , and the new Mrs. Stewart remarked to her husband , " The night we first met at the Coopers ' you ndiindgn . ' , I , say two words to me all eve- ) words ! " exclaimed Jimmy . that 's pr for the course . " When this remark was relayed to my wife , She looked very wise . " See , 1 knew he was playing way over his head . " The final flourish to Rocky 's matchmaking came from the Stcwarts on May 7 , 1951 . Twins . M an ex-advertising salesman and door-to-door canvasser , I have looked long for the source of my reputation as a nontal ker . I think I have traced it hark to my first full-length talking picture , The Virginian , which was the first major talkie ever shot outdoors . Mary Brian , playing the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cowpoke from Virginia . I remember that to keep my accent authentic . I even had a voice coach from Virginia  --  a young fellow named Randolph Scott . As the schoolteacher , Mary was supposed to polish up my ignorance , and in one scene the dialogue ran something like this : MARY : Did you read the book I gave you ? ME : Yup . MARY : Did you like it ? ME : Nape . MARY : Would you like to borrow an-other ? ME : Yup . MARY : Promise to read it all ? ME : Nope . It went on like that for a stretch , but it GUM out surprisingly well in the picture . So much 10 that while my name did n't mean much in 1929 , I was widely recognized for a long time as " that lanky guy in The Virginian , the one who said ' Yup ' and ' Nape . ' " I 'm afraid it has stuck . As an actor , I am exclusively a product of Hollywood . There is no stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into what is called the dramatic arts . At Grinnell College I tried hard to get a part in the annual play staged by the Dramatic Club . I was not stage-struck . I wanted a part because the play starred a girl I was sweet on , and I wanted to be in that third-act clinch . I did n't get the part ; I did n't even get elected to the Dramatic Club . On the other hand , I remember a scene in which I got enough stage training to last a lifetime , all in one day , and all in one lump . I made my debut not on one stage , but three , simultaneously . This becomes clearer when 1 explain that my producer was Cecil B. DeMille . One stage has never been enough for him . The occasion was the promise of The Unconquered , a picture dealing with the founding of Pittsburgh . That made it logical to hold the premdre in Chicago . Two of the largest theaters in Chicago face each other across State Street , and Destine decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture . To link their stages together , all he had to do was knock some holes in their walls and hang a suspension bridge over State Street . NOW , to me , Dalille is the master , and I often address him as such . This in no way lessens my respect for his contemporary , Sam Goldwyn . I 've made a lot of pictures for both of them , and I 'm mighty proud to have a couple of Hollywood fathers like them . For both of them I 'd risk my neck , and sometimes have , so when DeMille hinted he 'd like to have me at his shindig for a personal appearance , I just up and went , I forgot that I did n't know how to walk out ort a stage . I 'd never made a personal appearance before . In the wings of the first theater , my jitters grew until Paulette Goddard took pity on Mc , " It 's just like making an entrance in the movies , " she assured rnc . But it 's not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do , the director knows , and so do all the technicians . Ewe get what we want on the first take , fine . Otherwise we 'll shoot it over . But in the theater , you get no second chance to hide your mistakes . You step out on the stage and a thousand pairs of eyes challenge you . " Where 'd that jerk come from ? " And , " Why 's 1w sneaking off like that  --  him and his long wrist ? " As it turned out , I need n't have worried so much . Once things got rolling , I was snatched up like a log in a sawmill and passed along from hand to hand . In the middle of the first stage I yakked my five lines . Then the conveyor system ejected me out on die bridge to the theater across the Street . There must have been too people on the bridge . Nobody had told me that DeMille was staging a show in mid-air for the crowd in the street below . Virhat a man ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play to the whole Chicago Loop . By police count there were half a million people packing State Street and overflowing into all the side streets . ' Traffic was brought to a total stop for hours . While I was gawking at the acres of faces , I was tapped on the shoulder and tolcl that the crowd expected a few words from me . In the center of the bridge , a young , red-haired fellow was talking into a microphone , and waving for me to come on . Everything 1 had dreaded about the stage hit me all at once , but harder . Instead of being challenged by a thousand pairs of eyes , I was being challenged by half a million . Co ahead , Caaptr ; say someihrag MO . I could n't even open my mouth . But the crowd did n't faze the red-headed emcee . He had me by the elbow , and the next thing I knew I drew a laugh that shook windows up to the twelfth floor . Turned out his name was Red Skelton . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly killed himself tossing off gags . I left to the greatest roar of laughter ever heard on State Street .

Bing Crosby even has a Story to show just how relaxed 1 am in meeting the public . According to his yarn , which has some elements of truth in it , we were appearing together in Paris at the Kennease de Tgtoiles . This is quite a festive thing done up with real French touches . All clic French movie stars and any foreign stars who " happen " to be in town are invited to parade around on raised promenades in frontof their fans , and he introduced from the speaker 's platform .

Turned out the introduction was for me.
