Cat Brown 's Kittens Have Claws - We can whisper , or we can roar , - says the boss of our Mediterranean fleet , which makes us friends in the ancient world while it stands ready to deliver a knockout punch wherever it 's needed . By HAROLD H. MARTIN A few months ago , in his cabin on a swift gray fighting ship afloat in the Mediterranean , Vice-Admiral Charles R. ( Cat ) Brown , commander of the United States 6th Fleet , gave a visitor a brief history lesson . Adjusting his glasses on his nose , he pulled down a book from the shelf , and read aloud , in the lyrical prose of Mr. Emil Ludwig : " The Mediterranean is the Helen among oceans . Like her , it was desired by all who saw it ... fought over not for ten , but for two thousand years , and captured by the boldest . .. . Today , before our eyes , it is fought over anew . " Mr. Ludwig wrote in wartime . As the admiral spoke , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around the almost tideless sea that links and separates Europe , Africa and Asia . The volcano that had been rumbling in the Middle East had quieted down , and the hot tin roof on which " Cat " 33 Brown had for months been sitting was , for the moment , cool . But the implications of the brief quote were clear , the admiral said , Since time began , whenever two great nations rose to power around the Mediterranean 's shores , they inevitably locked in mortal combat on the sea , and their battles changed the face of history . Persia attacked Greece , and the Greeks , victorious , survived to give the world the doctrines of democracy on which Western civilization was built . Rome conquered Carthage , and for 300 years an empire lived in peace under the Roman concept of justice under law . Now , on a globe shrunk by the airplane to the dimensions of the ancient world , two great powers  --  the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. ? again stood face to face in ideological conflict . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flare at any moment across this troubled sea , set aflame by the Moslem world 's fiery nationalism and fanned by Russia 's bold ambition to rule the Mediterranean and the people along its shores . If that should happen , victory again would go only to ( Continued on Page 81 ) ' . larch 2 , 1957 the strongest and the boldest , the admiral said , And the battle would change the lives of men for generations . It would decide whether the brutal slavery of Communism or the principles in which free men believe should have dominion in Africa and Western Asia along the shores of Southern Europe . In that perspective , therefore , his task is simply this : To keep the peace if possible , by presenting in the Mediterranean a tangible symbol of our friendship for the Mediterranean peoples and our strength to defend them from attack : , if that should not suffice , to insure that in the hour when the first bomb falls or the first torpedo strikes , the great ships under his command shall have the toughness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such devastating power that , in the air and on the sea and far beyond its shores , the enemy would be destroyed . " If we last just forty-eight hours  --  and we can last , for ships at sea are hard to find and even harder to kill " ? the admiral said , " we can do the job we were sent out here to do . " To understand that job , it helps to take a brief look at the characteristics and the capabilities of this fighting force which now almost alone represents the power of the Western World in the Middle East . In the first place , it is a free-ranging fleet , with only the slenderest ties to nearby shores . The fighting ships never drop anchor together in the same harbor . The reasons for this are two . First , there is no port in all the Mediterranean that is safe from Soviet bombing planes . Second , a shore-based fleet gives up , in some degree , its mobility . It forfeits its capacity to keep the enemy wondering where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For more than half the time , therefore , the 6th Fleet makes its home on the blue water . While at sea it takes on oil and ammunition , food and supplies , and , once replenished , shakes off its service ships and goes its way . It follows no set schedule of port calls . It is as unpredictable in its movements as a school of fish . It is a small fleet , as sea-borne armadas go . Its fifty ships and 25,000 men do not match in numbers the great task forces that prowled the Pacific in the closing days of World War 11 . But the special weapons it can carry make it the strongest naval force that ever held the Mediterranean in its control . In terms of striking power , it is , in fact , the most powerful force afloat in the world today . Its power , however , can be flexibly applied . Any military organization is an instrument of diplomacy . Our 6th Fleet is designed as a precision instrument , capable of exerting the exact degree of force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All it needs to know is what that policy is. it can hold out a friendly hand or strike with an iron fist , whichever serves our purpose best . It can drop anything from a batch of warning leaflets to a thermonuclear bomb . It can land a band and color guard for a formal , friendly ceremony ashore  --  or it can send 2000 marines  --  soon to be armed with atomic rockets  --  storming over the beaches to take and hold enemy ground . In the first tense days of the Egyptian war it gave a dramatic demonstration of its ability to carry out one of its basic missions  --  the protection of Americans living abroad . In Egypt and Israel nearly 2000 American citizens were trapped in the war zone , their escape route cut off by the bombing of the airfields . It was 6th Fleet 's job to bring them out , using whatever force or show of force was necessary . Fortunately , none was needed except the presence of the great gray ships themselves . While the carriers and the missile ships steamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call if needed , the transports and destroyers of the fleet 's amphibious task force dropped anchor in point-blank range of the Egyptian coastal guns . They went in ready to fight if they had to , but not a shot was fired , and planes of the combatant nations veered off when they saw the American flag . For the battle-seasoned commanders of the task force , this must have been a strangely dreamlike operation . At Gaza they watched as Egyptian soldiers blew up their guns and smashed their small arms or threw them into the sea before the arrival of the Israeli forces . At Alexandria they lound themselves in the middle of a shooting war . Four miles inland , antiaircraft guns were firing and bombs were falling on the Jirfield . To seaward , and beside them in the harbor , Egyptian destroyers banged away furiously at the attacking planes . Yet no bombs fell near the ships . Sailors , tensed for battle , found themselves busy helping terrified old ladies aboard , sterilizing hottIes and nipples , mixing formulas , spooning strained vegetables into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ready to go ashore in assault , found themselves instead drilling and marching  --  to chow and bed  --  a platoon of small boys wearing cartridge belts and steel helmets . " We were ready to do what had to be done , " said Admiral Brown . " Our mission was to protect the people and the ships . If somebody had shot at us , we would have shot back . If the road from Cairo had been closed we would have put the marines ashore to open it and keep it open . if it had been necessary to put planes over the area , we would have done that too , " At the core of this striking force that can tailor its power to meet the demands of the moment are the fast attack carriers of Task Force 60 , commanded by a weather-beaten naval aviator , Rear Admiral Frank T. Ward . They carry the 6th Fleet 's knockout punch  --  the planes that can carry nuclear bombs ; the pilots trained in the special techniques of dropping them , the armorers who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . There are no atomic scientists with Task Force 60 , no specialists from the AEC . None are needed , for the Navy has trained its own . The range at which the 6th Fleet 's planes can deliver their bombs is obvious to any Russian who can lay a set of calipers on a map . Last year , when the Randolph and the Coral Sea were the carriers with the fleet , their prop-driven Sky-raiders , flying from the Eastern Mediterranean , could strike beyond the Baku oil fields and the Red naval installations on the Black Sea . From the Central Mediterranean they could roam over Bulgaria , Rumania , Albania , Czechoslovakia and East Germany , to the northern boundaries of Poland . This year , with the Coral Sea back in the States for modernization , and the great angled-deck Forrestal cruising with the Lake Champlain , that range has been extended to 1400 miles . The Forrestal 's twin-jet Skywarriors can reach to Moscow and Leningrad and beyond . If the combat ships can strike deep into the heart of Russia with atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their long-range planes , can strike the ships with similar weapons . If our submarines can cruise at will in the Mediterranean , Russian submarines , slipping in from the Black Sea , from Albania on the Adriatic or through the Strait of Gibraltar , can do the same . Day and night , therefore . the fleet cruises in a state of wary alertness , like a relaxed but watchful eat prowling a neighborhood where strange dogs lurk . Its radar eyes peer into the skies , its sonar ears are tuned to hear what may be moving in the depths of the sea . I t does not always travel buttoned up , blacked out and ready for instant battle . for men can not maintain such a state of readiness for more than eight hours without fatigue greatly reducing their alertness and efficiency . But there are live warheads on the torpedoes and ammunition in the gun tubs , and the tighter squadrons , armed with the deadly Sidewinder air-to-air missile , form a combat patrol aloft or stand by , ready for launching , on the decks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy cruiser , the Terrier , a surface-to-air rocket that rides a radar beam to its target , stands ready to smash high-flying bombers with a warhead that explodes with the impact of a 16-inch shell . When international flare-ups brine the danger of war nearer , Hunter-Killer teams join the fleet , their carrier planes and destroyers equipped with special gear designed to detect and destroy prowling submarines . On the des tro. e : hat protect the carriers and the n ships are electronic torpedoes that chase a dodging submarine like a beagle chasing it rabbit , and " hedgehogs " that spread a deadly pattern over the sea . In moments of possible danger , giant land-based planes cruise at great altitude above the fleet , transmitting the air traffic on their radarscopes by television to the Combat Information Centers in the ships below . By means at its disposal also , the fleet can monitor the movements of Red aircraft operating over their own terrain , " They may come at us , " one spokesman said . " And some of them may get through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or yet , they wo n't take us by surprise . " Tense or relaxed , the fleet at sea is busy around the clock on exercises as realistic as they can be made in peacetime . And there is no better way , perhaps , to understand the scope and complexity of these mock battles than to follow , in some detail , an operation that is typical of them all . It begins on the morning of December eleventh . The fleet is widely scattered , The flattop Randolph , with her protecting destroyers , is cruising south of Italy . The Coral Sea , with five destroyers and two submarines , is pulling out of Taranto , in the heel of the Italian boot . The Boston and the Macon are steaming south from Naples . From Athens and the Greek ports a destroyer division gets under way . From Rhodes the fleet 's Flagship , Salem , with four destroyers , steams westward toward the rendezvous , a point in the Ionian Sea called " Point Noel , " for this exercise  --  for after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All day these ships cut through waters where the fleets of the ancient world did battle , where Saint Paul passed , where the Crusaders sailed to the I-holy Land . But nobody on the gaunt gray ships has time to think of battles long ago . Each fleet unit is busy with a multitude of exercises  --  testing communications , working on gunnery , lire and bomb-damage drills , and antiradialion drills in which hoses spray the ships to wash them clean of poisonous fall-out . Tow planes pull sleeve targets through the sky to sharpen the eye of the antiaircraft gunners , and ships drag target sleds at which their sister ships can fire . The planes are flying day and night . Missile crews and electronics experts , pilots and plane-handling crews come to the fleet well trained , but only by long hours of drill together under simulated combat conditions can the fleet he , and remain , what a former commander once called it  --  a " clean , sharp sword . " At sunset on the first day , submarines from Taranto and destroyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deadly hide-and-seek . At dawn , the carrier units come together , and the pink morning akies are filled with silvery gray planes . headed northward to join the hunt for the submarines . The familiar blue of World War II is gone . The gray aircraft , the scientists say , would absorb less heat from an atomic blast . By midafternoon of the second day from north and west and cast , all units of the fleet have joined up at Point Noel , From beyond the horizon , where the Service Fleet is cruising , the tankers come in and the fighting ships come alongside to drink through long black hoses strung between the speeding ships . the next morning , a layman. accustomed to the tight formations of World War I/ and Korea , suffers a strong sense of shock . Destroyers , cruisers , flattops , all are gone , and his ship floats alone upon an empty sea , This , too , is part of the exercise . The atomic bomb has made obsolete the classic " bull's-eye " formation of World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a tight circle , protected by their close-in screen of " cans " ( destroyers ) and cruisers , for one well-aimed nuclear bomb or missile could destroy a whole task force , All the navies of the world , therefore , are experimenting now with dispersed formations which may spread it fighting fleet over a thousand square miles of sea . This scattering of the ships throws a great burden upon sea-borne communications . which must be effective at longer range than ever before . It complicates the task or the destroyers , which must protect the big ships from prowling submarines . But it makes the problem of the bombing plane far more difficult . His only profitable target is the carrier , and before he can hit it , he must find it and identify it . To be sure he is not wasting his atomic blast on some tender or cargo ship , he must come down to take a look , By then , presumably , the fleet 's radars have locked On him and the fighters are swarming over hint or the Terrier missile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , For three days , cruising in this far-flung formation , the fleet tests its defenses . Land planes , flying from Italy , Greece and Malta , roam through the skies , groping for the target ships , while the ships ' radars search for them . The subs dart in , trying to bring the flattops into torpedo range before the scurrying destroyers can spot them on their sounding gear . In the tomblike silence beneath the sea the submarines listen for the hurrying swoosh and rumble of the destroyers ' screws , the sharp clank on the hull , like the rap of a heavy hammer , which means that a depth charge has exploded nearby . The destroyer , when he drops his eharge , spreads a yellow dye marker at the spot . On Gertrude , the underwater telephone , the submarine hears the order to lire . and blows it big air bubble that seethes and foams on the surface . if dye and foam are close enough , the destroyer takes smug credit for a kill , While this grim game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fleet at the same time is putting its vast offensive powers to the test . Attack bombers , catapulting from the carrier decks , fly strikes against shore targets at the ultimate limit of their range . Live bombs are armed and loaded on the planes exactly as they would be in wartime  --  and then are renter .. ed and an equal weight of practice bombs put on . The targets arc on friendly shores , but they lie the same distance away as similar targets in Russia or her satellites . " All it would take to make it real would be to hang the big bomb on and swing the compass needle 0 , .. 21 " a little , " one weary pilot said , after a six-hour flight to a simulated target deep in Greece . " Plus , of course , having the fighters on you , and people shooting at you from the ground , " Sunday comes , and suddenly the sea is alive with ships again as the scattered fleet assembles . The Service Fleet comes up and the fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items of supply , from electronic gadgets to slap powder . On deck , transfer crews toil , tugging the heavy loads across on highlines strung between the moving ships . Below decks , though , a Sunday calm prevails . Tired men snatch a few hours ' sleep , read , write letters , watch movies and go to church . Helicopters , the taxicabs of the fleet , scurry between ships , carrying chaplains . with their Bibles and altar furnishings . They land on the larger ships , but over the working ships whose decks are cluttered with booms and cranes , they hover in the air while the clergyman descends slowly , hanging in a harness resembling a large horse collar . Sunday , too , brings mail . The C.O.D . plane comes in from Naples ( C.O.D . means Carrier on Board Delivery ' , landing on the carrier bearing bulging sacks of letters . As the C.O.D . lands , the helicopters come swarming from throughout the fleet , and all day the aerial postmen are busy delivering the mail . Usually , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , when the snows are deep back home , an amazing number of governors , congressmen and high brass from Washington find it necessary to make a quick journey to the Mediterranean for a short cruise with the fleet . The admiral and his commanders welcome them with bands and ceremony , for they are proud of their fine , clean ships and the men who sail them , and of the job the fleet can do , and they are pleased that folks from back home like to come out to watch them work . Monday , the " war " is on again . The fleet is steaming north and west . toward Point Santa in the Tyrrhenian Sea . Planes from Naples now join the air armada searching for the ships . The subs press their attack . Day and night the combat Information Centers trace the flight path of the many planes , and plot the submarine contacts . Spotted throughout the fleet , trained observers watch the play of the problem . As the exercise ends , they will come by helicopter to the flagship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snooping planes to find the ships ? How quickly did the ships pick up the invading bombers ? How long did it take the missile ships to get locked onto the target , so that their Terriers could fire ? How effective were the fleet 's protective measures against the attacking submarines ? The 6th Fleet 's self-analysis , however , goes beyond the evaluation of naval tactics and techniques by naval men , whose judgments may be affected by their loyalty to is branch of their service , or by their experiences in war . Traveling with the fleet , evaluating its operations with the unbiased eye of a layman , is a thoughtful young M.I.T. scientist , a Ph.D. , whose job it is to determine , by cold mathematics , the effectiveness of defense and attack procedures . At midnight on the eighth day the exercise ends . Again the service ships come alongside , for the fleet never goes into port needing supplies that might delay its putting to sea in a hurry . With bunkers topped off and magazines full , the ships begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cannes , the Randolph and its destroyers set their course for Naples . The Boston goes to Genoa , the subs and some of the supply ships are hound for Barcelona . The destroyers head for Leghorn , and the Salem , one of the few ships home-ported in the Med , sails for Villefranche on the French Riviera , where wives and children are waiting . Tension eases as the play of the problem ends , but work goes on . Mustached chiefs probe with tiny tools and sensitive jewelers ' fingers into the complex wiring of delicate electronic gear burned out by hard usage during the exercises . Guns foul from practice firing are torn down and cleaned and reassembled , ready to fire again . Bulkheads ring with the clang of chipping hammers , and the decks are awash with soapy water , and crawling with working parties plying swabs and paintbrushes . On the Salem , holystone gangs , working to a rock-and-roll chant , rub scarred decks smooth and white as old bone . The ships , when they go into port , arrive as clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come off the ways . The fleet at sea is a fighting force alone , and its only concern is to test and sharpen its combat capability . Ashore , it puts on its second hat and slides gracefully into another role . " We are here , primarily , for one thing only , " says Admiral Brown , " to protect American lives and property , and to defend the shores of the countries which have allied themselves with us in NATO . But we 've got another job , that is equally important  --  to win the respect and the friendship of the people we visit here . " For the flag officers of the fleet , this combined social and diplomatic mission makes the brief stay in port a fairly hectic time . The first day is spent in making formal calls on dignitaries ashore , and the first evening is always spent at an official reception . On the second day the local officials repay the admiral 's call and the ship holds its own reception to repay its hosts of the evening before . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits which help to make formal social events more relaxed and easy , is forbidden on American ships . The fleet , however , has overcome this handicap . The admiral serves his guests a sparkling Catawba grape juice , an innocent beverage which looks like champagne , pops like champagne when the cork is pulled , and bubbles most satisfactorily against the nose . Soon , stimulated by the power &suggestion,; the guests are laughing and chatting happily . The admiral 's punch , served at larger affairs , is also noted throughout the Mediterranean , though it also is innocent of alcohol . It is made up of a base of strong black tea , maraschino cherries , fresh lemon juice , orange juice and fruit sirup  --  either raspberry , loganberry or strawberry  --  to which is added white or purple grape juice , grapefruit juice or pineapple juice . Diluted with charged water and served chilled and not too sweet , this concoction has attracted favorable attention from the King and Queen of Greece , plus various governors , mayors , harbor masters , prefects and prelates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officials is over , the ships may hold open house for all citizens who wish to come and visit them . Pamphlets printed in the language of the country describe the ship and its mission , refreshments are served and the children are entertained with cartoon movies . The fleet also takes part , whenever possible , in the life of the people ashore . Ships ' bands play in the public squares for the benefit of local charities , athletic teams compete with the local baseball , basketball and soccer teams , and the ships make heavy donations of clothing and food to orphanages and hospitals , The old naval custom of marching crew members to church ashore behind the ship 's band has been revived . The fleet times its visits so that it shall never arrive or depart on a weekend , which would require the local bigwigs to interrupt their holiday , and it is very careful about offending in other ways . When the ships are at anchor , helicopters patrol the harbors , checking on those which might be sullying the waters with oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carriers put to sea , so that the scream of the jets will not disturb any citizen who might be taking a siesta . None of these thoughtful gestures of courtesy , cordiality and friendship would have much lasting effect , of course , if the sailors going ashore conducted themselves in is rude and boisterous manner . The fleet tries to make sure that they do n't . Aboard each ship is a mammoth volume called the Mediterranean Port Directory , compiled from the experiences and observations of thousands of men on shore leave in Mediterranean ports over a number of years . A combination travel guide , shopping guide and book of shore-going etiquette , it traces the history , the traditions and the customs of the people of each country , and lays down rules of behavior for every port where the ships drop anchor . " Remember , " says the directory , " the Middle Easterner 's temperament is very strange . He will flare up at what might be to you a mild or inoffensive comment . Above all , in conversation with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli-Egypt situation . " The sailors are also advised not to engage in political discussions in Greece . " The Greeks , " the directory says , " are ardent politicians and they are inclined to defend their views dramatically " ? meaning that a sailor defending the presence of the British on Cyprus is likely to be rapped on the skull with a bottle . The directory also deals in detail with less lofty matters than politics . " In Greece , " it advises , " do not pet or play with strange dogs . " ..... For the best Martini in town , go to the bar across from the drill field . " , . . " Ouzo , the local drink , is not to be trusted . Men unaccustomed to this beverage when combined with the heat of the afternoon sun succumb quickly and must be assisted by the shore patrol . " " The way I get it , " one sailor said , " the two greatest threats to the fleet in the Med are OUZO and Russian submarines . " The fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine appreciation of the history and the achievements of the Mediterranean countries , and of all the lands of the NATO alliance that can be reached by liberty parties . Carrying out this cultural program , 6th Fleet sailors go on guided tours to Rome , Florence , Pisa , Capri , Pompeii and Herculaneum . From ports north of Rome , they visit Venice , Turin , Milan , Lake Como , Munich , Garmisch-Partenkirchen , Salzburg and the Bavarian Alps . From French ports they go to Paris . In Greece they see Athens and the Acropolis , Salamis , where Xerxes ' fleet was defeated , and Mount Athos with its ancient monastery . Before the trouble flared in the Middle East , they could go to Jerusalem from Beirut to tour the holy places . They visit Rhodes and argue learnedly about the exact point where the Colossus stood .

He picks up good British woolens in Gibral-tar and has their made up by Spanish tailors in Barcelona or Greek tailors in Rhodes , and at Sylvia 's in Villefranche-sur-Mer he buys fine French perfumes that would cost hint a fortune on Fifth Avenue . He buys accordions in Naples and guitars in Sicily , and when , in some ( Canated on Page 84 ) Greek or th ( Continuer ) front Page 82 ) Turkish port the folk dancers come to romp on the fantail of his ship , he repays them with the wailing strains of hillbilly music . Along with his souvenirs , he acquires a thousand mingled memories : of the Parthenon by moonlight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water bikes at Cannes ; of the sun on the old stones at Pompeii , and gondolas on the Grand Canal , and the Blue Mosque at Istanbul , and of the sound and smell of a at all , except for an interlude when he was being held incommunicado . In that interlude he pleaded guilty at a preliminary hearing and signed a confession . He says that the confession and the guilty plea were no good , and has had the satisfaction of having the Supreme Court of the United States agree with him . Turner has been tried five times . In the first four trials the juries found him guilty and fixed punishment at death in the electric chair  --  under Pennsylvania law the jury has the power to choose its penalty . All four of the death verdicts were reversed on appeal . The fifth jury brought in a verdict of life imprisonment . At Turner 's behest , this verdict is now in the appeals mill . He is taking a big risk in appealing the fifth verdict , as a reversal will almost certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury will he in an electrocuting mood . It is axiomatic that no one can predict what a jury will do . Turner , though only semiliterate , is fully aware of this hazard . When the subject is brought up he says , simply : " I was n't there ( at the broom factory ) and I did n't do it . " He has had plenty of time to consider the matter , as he has already served more than ten years in prison . Turner , a native of Marshville , North Carolina , had to leave school in the fourth grade in order to share in the support of a number of brothers and sisters . He worked for farmers and in a sawmill . During the depression of the 1930 's he joined in the drift which brought so many of his race to the big cities of the North . Arriving in Philadelphia in 1939 , he got a job loading and unloading crates of chickens in the Front Street market . When the chicken business went slack , he worked as a longshoreman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was arrested on suspicion a good deal . He served a term of ninety days in Washington , D.C. , for tampering with an automobile , and a similar term in Jessups , Maryland , for getting involved in an inconclusive cutting scrape . In Philadelphia , prior to the broom-factory case , he Was arrested half a dozen times for such infractions of the law as disorderly conduct and playing cards for money on the sidewalk , and each time was released . Also enwrapped in the case for a decade , but voluntarily , has been the indigent Turner 's court-appointed lawyer , Edwin P. Rome , who is , oddly , a specialist in antitrust litigation . Rome 's performance in gradually chipping away the commonwealth 's case over the years has been impressive . In the process , Rome has learned a lot about criminal law .

In 1942 he had joined the law firm of William A. Gray , who was , and still is , though in his eighties , one of the shrewdest criminal-practice lawyers in the country . Five months later , Rome was drafted . He served in the European Theater of Operations as assistant adjutant of the 287th Combat Engineer Battalion . At the close of the war he was a warrant officer , junior grade . Transferred to the Judge Advocate section of 7th Army headquarters , he assisted in disposing of a backlog of court-martial cases which had accumulated .

The alibi had to cover only fifteen crucial minutes ; men working in a garage opposite the broom factory had told the detectives that they saw Simmons and Endres enter it at about 4:45 P.kl. and Patrolman Monaghan had given 5:00 rem . as the approximate time he had discovered the victims . When Rome and Palmer first visited Turner in prison , they asked him how he had spent the afternoon of December 15 , 1945 , and got the frank answer that he had n't the slightest idea .
