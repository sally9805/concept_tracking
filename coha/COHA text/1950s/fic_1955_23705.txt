Part HI of a Novel in Four Parts by GRAHAM GREENE LOSER TAKES ALL Bertram , an accountant in a London firm headed by eccentric old Herbert Dreuther , accepts the Gom 's ( Grand Old Man 's ) suggeition that he be married ' at Dreuther 's expense in Monte Carlo and have a honeymoon cruise on his yacht . With his lovely young bride-to-be , named Cary , Bertram arrives on the date set and moves into the costly hotel rooms reserved by Dreuther 's secretary . When it becomes apparent that the Corn has forgotten the plan and the Seagull does not arrive , the couple are married happily but begin to run out of funds . Bertram insists on buying a gambling " system " fichn a run-down habitud  --  one of several desperate gamblers they have observed , including a handsome hungry young man , an elderly invalid named Barnes who is a minor partner in the Dreuther firm. , and a garish blonde . Despite Cary 's protests , Bertram starts betting , with money advanced by the hotel management .

It gave me great satisfaction to pay back the manager and leave my key at the desk . I frequently rang the hell for the pleasure of confronting a uniform without shame . I made Cary have an Elizabeth Arden treatment , and I ordered the Gruand Larose 1934 ( I even sent it back because it was not the right temperature ) . I had our things moved to a suite and I hired a car to take us to the beach . At the beach I hired one of the private bungaCopyright 1951 , 1955 by Graham Greene lows where we could sunbathe , cut off by bushes and shrubs from the eyes of common people . There all day 1 worked in the sun ( for I was not yet quite certain of my system ) while Cary read ( I had even bought her a new book ) . I discovered that as on the stock exchange money bred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-hundred-franc tokens , and inevitably at the end of the day I found myself richer by several million . My good fortune became known : casual players would bet on the squares where I had laid my biggest stake , but they had not protected themselves , as I had with my other stakes , and it was seldom that they won . I noted a strange aspect of human nature , that though my system worked and theirs did not , the veterans never lost faith in their own calculations  --  not one abandoned his elaborate schemes which led to nothing but loss to follow my victorious method . The second dal , when I had already increased my five million to nine , I heard an old lady say bitterly , " What deplorable luck , " as thought it were my good fortune alone that prevented the wheel revolving to her system . On the third day I began to attend the Casino for longer hours  --  I would put in three hours in the morning in the kitchen and the same in the afternoon , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious labor in the Salle Priv  --  e . Cary had accompanied me on the second day and I had given her a few thousand francs to play with ( she invariably lost them ) , but on the third day I thought it best to ask her to stay away . I found her anxious presence at my elbow distracting , and twice I made a miscalculation because she spoke to me . " I love you very much , darling , " I said to her , " but work is work . You go and sunbathe , and we 'll see each other for meals . " " Why do they call it a game of chance ? " she said . " How do you mean ? " " It 's not a game , " she said . " You said it yourself  --  it 's work . YOu 've begun to commute . Breakfast at nine thirty sharp , so as to catch the first table . What a lot of beautiful money you 're earning . At what age will you retire ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of retirement , darling . We shall see so much more of each other , and we could fit up a little roulette wheel in your study . It will be so nice when you do n't have to cross the road in all weathers . " That night I brought my winnings up to fifteen million francs before dinner , and I felt it called for a celebration . I had been neglecting Cary a little  --  I realized that , so I thought we would have a good dinner and go to the ballet instead of my returning to the tables . I told her that and she seemed pleased . " Tired business man relaxes , " she said . " As a matter of fact I am a little tired . " Those who have not played roulette seriously little know how fatiguing it can be . If I had worked less hard during the afternoon I would n't have lost my temper with the waiter in the bar . I had ordered two very dry Martinis and he brought them to us quite drowned in Vermouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasting . To make matters worse he tried to explain away the color by saying he had used Booth 's gin . " But you know perfectly well that I only take Gordon 's , " I said and sent them back . He brought me two more and he had put lemon peel in them . I said , " For God 's sake how long does one have to be a customer in this bar before you begin to learn one 's taste ? " " I 'm sorry , sir . I only came yesterday . " I could see Cary 's mouth tighten . I was in the wrong of course , but I had spent a very long day at the Casino , and she might have realized that I am not the kind of man who is usually crotchety with servants . She said , " Who would think that a week ago we did n't even dare to speak to a waiter in case he gave us a bill ? " When we went in to dinner there was a little trouble about our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as I said to Cary we had been good customers and they could have taken some small trouble to please . However , this time I was careful not to let my irritation show more than very slightly  --  I was determined that this dinner should be one to remember . Cary as a rule likes to have her mind made up for her , so I took the menu and began to order . " Caviar , " I said . " For one , " Cary said . " What will you have ? Smoked salmon ? " " You order yours , " Cary said . I ordered " bresse a l'estragon a la broche , " a little Roquefort and some wild strawberries . This , I thought , was a moment too for the Gruaud Larose ' 34 ( they would have learned their lesson about the temperature ) . I leaned back feeling pleased and contented : my dispute with the waiter was quite forgotten , and I knew that I had behaved politely and with moderation when T found that our table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " A roll and'butter and a cup of coffee , " Cary said . " But Madame perhaps would like . . . " She gave him her sweetest smile as though to show me what I had missed . She said , " Just a roll and butter please . I 'm not hungry . To keep Monsieur company . " I said angrily , " In that case I 'll cancel .. . " but the waiter had already gone . I said , " How dare you ? " " What 's the matter , darling ? " " You know very well what 's the matter . You let me order . . . . " MAGAZINE " But truly I 'm not hungry , darling . I just wanted to be sentimental , that 's all . A roll and butter reminds me of the days when we were n't rich . Do n't you remember that little cafe at the foot of the steps ? " " You are laughing at me . " " But no , darling . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those days , those days  --  why do n't you talk about last week and how you were afraid to send anything to the laundry and we could n't afford the English papers and you could n't read the French ones and . . . " " Do n't you remember how reckless you were when you gave five francs to a beggar ? Oh , that reminds me . . . " " What of ? " " I never meet the hungry young man now . " " I do n't suppose he goes sunbathing . " My caviar came and my vodka . The waiter said , " Would Madame like her coffee now ? " " No . No . I think I 'll toy with it while Monsieur has his  --  his . . . " " Bresse n I'estragon , madame . " I 've never enjoyed caviar less . She watched every helping I took , her chin in her hand , leaning forward in what I suppose she meant to be a devoted and wifely way . The toast crackled in the silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ate the next course grimly to an end and pretended not to notice how she spaced out her roll  --  she could n't have been enjoying her meal much either . She said to the waiter , " I 'll have another cup of coffee to keep my husband company with his strawberries . Would n't you like a half bottle of champagne , darling ? " " No . If I drink any more I might lose my self-control . . . . " " Darling , what have I said ? Do n't you like me to remember the days when we were poor and happy ? After all if I had married you now it might have been for your money . You know you were terribly nice when you gave me five hundred francs to gamble with . You watched the wheel so seriously . " " Are n't I serious now ? " " You do n't watch the wheel any longer . You watch lour paper and your figures . Darling , we are on holiday . " " We would have been if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go by ourselves now . - Let 's take a plane tomorrow  --  anywhere . " " Not tomorrow . You see according to my calculations the cycle of loss comes up tomorrow . Of course I 'll only use thousand-franc tokens , so as to reduce the incident . " " Then the day after . . . " " That 's when I have to win back on double stakes . If you 've finished your coffee it 's time for the ballet . " " I 've got a headache . I do n't want to go . " " Of course you 've got a headache eating nothing but rolls . " " / ate nothing but rolls for three days and I never had a headache . " She got up from the table and said slowly , " But in those days I was in love . " I refused to quarrel and I went alone . I CA N'T remember which ballet it was  --  I do n't know that I could have remembered even the same night . My mind was occupied . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day after , otherwise my system was at fault . My whole stupendous run would prove to have been luck only  --  the kind of luck that presumably by the laws of chance turns up once in so many centuries , just as those long-lived laborious monkeys who are set at typewriters eventually in the course of centuries produce the works of Shakespeare . The ballerina to me was hardly a woman so much as a ball spinning on the wheel : when she finished her final movement and came before the curtain alone it was as though she had come to rest triumphantly at zero and all the counters around her were shoveled away into the back  --  the two thousand francs from the cheap seats with the square tokens from the stalls , all jumbled together . I took a turn on the terrace to clear my head : this was where we had stood the first night watching together for the Seagull. wished Cary had been with me and I nearly returned straightaway to the hotel to give her all she asked . She was right : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plane , extend our holiday : I had enough now to buy a partnership in some safe modest business without walls of glass and modern sculpture and a Coln on the eighth floor , and yet  --  it was like leaving a woman one loved untouched , untasted , to go away and never know the truth of how the ball had come to rest in that particular order  --  the poetry of absolute chance or the determination of a closed system ? I would be grateful for the poetry , but what pride I should feel if I proved the determinism . The regiment was all assembled : strolling by the tables I felt like a commanding officer inspecting his unit . I would have liked to reprove the old lady for wearing the artificial daisies askew on her hat and to speak sharply to Mr. Bowles for a lack of polish on his ear-appliance . A touch on my elbow and I handed out my 200 token to the lady who cadged . " Move more smartly to it , " I wanted to say to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bent at the elbow , and it 's time you did something about your hair . " They watched me pass with expressions of nervous regret , waiting for me to choose my table , and when I halted somebody offered me a seat . But I had not come to win  --  I had come symbolically to make my first loss and go . Socourteously I declined the seat , laid out my tokens and with a sense of triumph saw them shoveled away . Then I went back to the hotel . Cary was n't there , and I was disappointed . I wanted to explain to her the importance of that symbolic loss , and instead I could only undress and climb between the humdrum sheets , I slept fitfully . I had grown used to Cary 's company , and I put on the light at one to see the time , and I was still alone . At half past two Cary woke me as she felt her way to bed in the dark . " Where 've you been ? " I asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself ? " " No . " The space between the beds filled with her hostility . but I knew better than to strike the first blow  --  she was waiting for that advantage . I pretended to roll over and settle for sleep . After a long time she said , " We walked down to the Sea Club . " " It 's closed . " " We found a way in  --  it was very big and eerie in the dark with all the chairs stacked . " " Quite an adventure . What did you do for light ? " ' ' Oh , there was bright moonlight . Philippe told me all about his life . " " I hope you unstacked a chair . " " We sat on the floor . " " If it was a madly interesting life tell it me . Otherwise it 's late and I have to be .. . " " ' Up early for the Casino . ' I do n't suppose you 'd find it an interesting life . It was so simple , idyllic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school at a lyc  --  e . " " Most people do in France . " " His parents died and he lived with his grand-mother . " " What about his grandfather ? " " He was dead too . " " Senile mortality is very high in France . " " He did military service for two years . " said , " It certainly seems a life of striking originality . " " You can sneer and sneer , " she said . " But , dear , I 've said nothing . " " Of course you would n't be interested . You are never interested in anybody different from yourself , and he 's young and very poor . He feeds on coffee and rolls . " " Poor fellow , " I said with genuine sympathy . " You are so uninterested you do n't even ask his name . " " You said it was Philippe . " " Philippe who ? " she asked triumphantly . " Dupont , " I said . " It is n't . It 's Chantier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dupont . " " Who 's Dupont ? " " Perhaps they look alike . " " I said who 's Dupont . " " I 've no idea , " I said . " But it 's awfully late . " " You 're unbearable . " She slapped her pillow as though it were my face . There was a pause of several minutes and then she said bitterly , " You have n't even asked whether I slept with him . " " I 'm sorry . Did you ? " " No . But he asked me to spend the night with him . " " On the stacked chairs ? " " I 'm having dinner with him tomorrow . " She was beginning to get me in the mood she wanted . I could stop myself no longer . I said , " Who the hell is this Philippe Chantier ? " " The hungry young man , of course . " " Are you going to dine on coffee and rolls ? " " I 'm paying for the dinner . He 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere very cheap and quiet and simple  --  a sort of students ' place . " " That 's lucky , " I said , " because I 'm dining out too . Someone I met tonight at the Casino . " " Who ? " " A Madame Dupont . " " There 's no such name . " " I could n't tell you the right one . I 'm careful of a woman 's honor . " " Who is she ? " " She was winning a lot tonight at baccarat and we got into conversation . Her husband died recently , she was very fond of him , and she 's sort of drowning her sorrows . I expect she 'll soon find comfort , because she 's young and beautiful and intelligent and rich . " " Where are you having dinner ? " " Well , I do n't want to bring her here  --  there might he talk . And she 's too well known at the Salle Privie . She suggested driving to Cannes where nobody would know us . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall he late . " " Exactly what I was going to say to you , dear . " It was that sort of night . As I lay awake  --  and was aware of her wakefulness a few feet away  --  I thought , it 's the Gom 's doing , he 's even ruining our marriage now . I said , " Dear , if you 'll give up your dinner , I 'll give up mine . " She said , " I do n't even believe in yours . You invented it . " " I swear to you  --  word of honor  --  that I 'm giving a woman dinner tomorrow night . " She said , " I ca n't let Philippe down . " I thought gloomily : now I 've got to do it , and where the hell can I find a woman ? 11 E WERE very polite to each other at breakfast and at lunch . Cary even came into the Casino with me in the early evening , but I think her sole motive was to spot my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty was sitting at one of the tables , and Cary obviously drew the incorrect conclusion . She tried to see whether we exchanged glances and at last she could restrain her curiosity no longer . She said to me , " Are n't you going to speak to her ? " " Who ? " ' That girl . " " I do n't know what you mean , " I said and tried to convey in my tone of voice that I was still guarding the honor of another . Cary said furiously , " I must be off . I ca n't keep Philippe waiting . He 's so sensitive . " My system was working : I was losing exactly what I had anticipated losing , but all the exhilaration had gone out of my calculations . I thought : suppose this is n't what they call a lovers ' quarrel ; suppose she 's really interested in this man ; suppose this is the end . What do I do ? What 's left for me ? Fifteen thousand pounds was an inadequate answer . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bowles sat in his wheeled chair , directing his nurse who put the tokens on the cloth for him , leaning over his shoulders , pushing with her private rake . He too had a system , but I suspected that his system was not working out . He sent her back twice to the desk for more money , and the second time I saw that his pocketbook was empty except for a few thousand-franc notes , He rapped out his directions and she laid out his remaining tokens-150,000 francs ' worth of them  --  the ball rolled and he lost the lot . Wheeling away he caught sight of me . " You , " he said , " what 's your name ? " " Bertram . " " I 've cashed too little . Do n't want to go back to the hotel . Lend me five million . " " I 'm sorry , " I said . " You know who I am . You know what I 'm worth . " " The hotel . . . " I began . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . I want it tonight . You 've been winning plenty . I 've watched you . I 'll pay you back before the evening 's out . " " People have been known to lose . " " I ca n't hear what you say , " he said , shifting his earpiece . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Other , " I said . " My name 's not Other . You know me . I 'm A. N. Bowles . " " We call you A. N. Other in the office . Why do n't you go to the bank here and cash a check ? There 's someone always on duty . " " I have n't got a French account , young man . Have n't you heard of currency regulations ? " " They do n't seem to he troubling either of us much , " I said . " You 'd better come and have a cup of coffee and discuss the matter . " " I 'm busy just now . " " Young man , " the Other said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't recognize anybody but the Gorr . " " Who on earth is the Gom ? " " Mr. Dreuther . " The Gom , A. N. Other . There seems to be a curious lack of respect for the heads of your firm . Sir Walter Blixon  --  has he a name ? " " I believe the junior staff know him as the Blister . " A thin smile momentarily touched the gray powdery features . " At least that name is expressive , " A. N. Other remarked . " Nurse , you can take a walk for half-an-hour . You can go as far as the harbor and back . You like boats . " When I turned the chair and began to push Bowles into the bar , a slight sweat had formed on my forehead and hands . An idea had come to me so fantastic that it drove away the thought of Gary and her hungry squire . I could n't even wait till I got to the bar . I said , " I 've got fifteen million francs in my safe-deposit box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return for your shares . " " Do n't be a fool . They are worth twenty million at par , and Dreuther or Blixon would give me fifty million for them . A glass of Perrier water , please . " I got him his water . lie said , " Now , fetch me that five million . " " No . " " Young man , " he said , " I have an infallible system . I have promised myself for twenty years to break the bank . I will not be foiled by a mere five million . Go fetch them . Unless you do I shall order your dismissal . " " Do you think that threat means anything to a man with fifteen million in the safe ? And tomorrow I shall have twenty million . " " You 've been losing all tonight . I 've watched . " " I had expected to lose . It proves my system 's right . " " There ca n't be two infallible systems . " " Yours , I 'm afraid , will prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nb . But I 'll advise you on what is wrong with yours . " " My system is my own . " " How much have you won by it ? " " I have not yet begun to win . I am only at the first stage . Tonight I begin to win . Damn you , young man , fetch me that five million . " " My system has won over fifteen million . " I had got a false impression that the Other was a calm man . It is easy to appear calm when your movements are so confined . But when his fingers moved an inch on his knee he was exhibiting an uncontrollable emotion : his head swayed a minute degree and set the cord of his ear-appliance flapping . It was like the tiny stir of air clinking a shutter that is yet the sign of a tornado 's approach . He said , " Suppose we have hit on the same system . " We have n't . I 've been watching yours . I know it well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stationer 's for a thousand francs . " " That 's false . 1 thought it out myself , over the years , young man , in this chair . Twenty years of years . " " It 's not only great minds that think alike . But the hank will never he broken by a thousand franc system marked on the envelope Infallible . " " I 'll prove you wrong . I 'll make you eat that packet . Fetch me the five million . " " I 've told you my terms . " Backward and forward and sideways moved the hands in that space to which illness confined him . They ran like mice in a cage  --  I could imagine them nibbling at the intolerable bars . " You do n't know what you are asking . Do n't you realize you 'd control the company if you chose to side with Nixon ? " " At least I would know something about the company controlled . " " Listen . If you let me have the five million tonight , I will repay it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There wo n't he any winnings with your sys-tem . " " You seem very sure of yours , " he said . " Yes . " " I might consider selling the shares for twenty million plus your system . " " I have n't got twenty million , " I replied . " Listen , if you are so sure of yourself you can take an option on the shares for fifteen million now . You pay the balance in twenty-four hours ? 9:00 P.M. tomorrow  --  or you forfeit your fifteen million . In addition you give me your system . " " It 's a crazy proposal , " I said . " This is a crazy place . " " If I do n't win five million tomorrow , I do n't have a single share ? " " Not a single share . " The fingers had stopped moving . I laughed . " Does n't it occur to you that I 've only got to phone the office tomorrow , and Blixon would advance me the money on the option ? He wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agreement is for cash . " " I do n't give you my system till the final payment , " I said . ' ' I sha n't want it if you 've lost . " " But I need money to play with . " He took that carefully in . I said , " You ca n't run a system on a few thousand francs . " " You can pay ten million now , " he said , " on account of fifteen . If you lose , you 'll owe me five . " " How would you get it ? " He gave me a malign grin . " I 'll have your wages docked five hundred a year for ten years . " I believe he meant it . In the world of Dreuther and Blixon he and his small packet of shares had survived only by the hardness , the meanness , and the implacability of his character . " I shall have to win ten million with five million , " I said . " You said you had the perfect system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man was bitten by his own gamble : he jeered at me . " Better just lend me the five million and forget the option . " I thought of the Gnm at sea in his yacht with his headline guests . and the two of us forgotten  --  what did he care about his assistant accountant ? I remembered the way he had turned to Miss Bli ! len and said , " Arrange for Mr. Bertrand ( he could n't bother to get my name right ) to he married . " Would he arrange through Miss Bullen for our children to be born and our parents to be buried ? I thought , with these shares at Blixon 's call I shall have him fixed  --  he 'll be powerless , I 'll be employing him for just as long as I want him to feel the sting : then no more room on the eighth floor , no more yacht , no more of his " luxe , mime et volupt ? . " He had taken me in with his culture and his courtesy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great man he believed himself to be . Now , 1 thought with a sadness for which I could n't account , he will be small enough to he in my hands , and I looked at my ink-stained fingers with disrelish . " You see , " the Other said , " you do n't believe any longer . " " Oh , yes , I do , " I said , " I 'll take your bet . I was just thinking of something else  --  that 's all . " 12 I WENT and fetched the money and we drew up the option right away on a sheet of notepaper and the nurse  --  who had returned by then  --  and the barman witnessed it . The option was to be taken up at 9:01 ) P.M. prompt in the same spot next day : the Other did n't want his gambling to be interrupted before his dinner hour whether by good or bad news . Then I made him buy me ' a glass of whisky , though Moses had less trouble in extracting his drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being pushed back to the Salle Priv  --  e . To all intents and purposes , for the next twenty-four hours , I was the owner of Sitra . Neither Dreuther nor Blixon in their endless war could make a move without the consent of their assistant accountant . It was strange to think that neither was aware of how the control of the business had changed  --  from a friend of Drcuther to an enemy of Dreuther . MAGAZINE Blixon would be down in Hampshire reading up tomorrow 's lessons , polishing up his pronunciation of the names in Judges  --  he would feel no exhilaration . And Dreuther  --  Dreuther was at sea , out of reach , playing bridge probably with his social lions  --  he would not be touched by the sense of insecurity . I ordered another whisky : I no longer doubted my system and I had no sense of regret . Mixon would be the first to hear : I would telephone to the office on Monday morning . It would be tactful to inform him of the new position through my chief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Blixon against the intruder : I would have Arnold explain to Blixon that for the time being he could count on me . Dreuther would not even hear of the matter unless he rang up his office from some port of call . Even that I could prevent : I could tell Arnold that the secret must be kept till Dreuther 's return , for then 1 would have the pleasure of giving him the information in person . I went out to tell Cary the news , forgetting about our engagements : 1 wanted to see her face when I told her she was the wife of the man who controlled the company . You 've hated my system , I wanted to say to her , and the hours I have spent at the Casino , but there was no vulgar cause  --  motive than money . I began to believe that I had planned this from the first two hundred franc bet in the cuisine . B U T of course there was no Cary to be found ? " Madame went out with a gentleman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the date at the simple students ' caf ? . Well , there had been a time in my life when I had found little difficulty in picking up a woman and I went back to the Casino to fulfill my word . But the beautiful woman had got a man with her now : their fingers nuzzled over their communal tokens , and I soon realized that single women who came to the Casino to gamble were seldom either beautiful or interested in men . The ball and not the bed was the focal point . I thought of Cary 's questions and my own lies  --  and there was n't a lie she would n't see through . I watched Bird 's Nest , the middle-aged blonde whose " system " Cary had imitated so disastrously , circling among the tables , making a quick pounce here and there , out of the croupier 's eye . She had a masterly technique : when a pile was large enough she would lay her fingers on a single piece and give a tender ogle at the owner as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am all yours for the taking . " She was so certain of her own appeal that no one had the heart to expose her error . Tonight she was wearing long amber earrings and a purple evening dress that exposed her best feature  --  her shoulders . Her shoulders were magnificient , wide and animal , but then , like a revolving light , her face inevitably came round , the untidy false blonde hair tangled up with the earrings ( I am sure she thought of her wisps and strands as " wanton locks " ) , and that smile fixed like a fossil . Watching her revolve I began to revolve too : I was caught into her orbit , and I became aware that here alone was the answer . I had to dine with a woman and in the whole Casino this was the only woman who would dine with me . As she swerved away from an attendant with a sweep of drapery and a slight clank , clank from her evening hag where I supposed she had stowed her hundred-franc tokens , I touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the phrase astonished me : it was as though it had been placed on my tongue , and certainly it seemed to belong to the same period as the mauve evening dress , the ! nagni6cient shoulders . " Dear lady , " I repeated with increasing astonishment ( I almost expected a small white mustache to burgeon on my upper lip ) , " you will I trust excuse a stranger . . .. " I think she must have gone in constant fear of the attendants because her instinctive ogle expanded with her relief at seeing me into a positive blaze of light : it flapped across the waste of her face like sheet lightning . " Oh , not a stranger , " she said and I was relieved to find that she was English and that at least I would not have to talk bad French throughout the evening . " I have been watching with such admiration your great good fortune . " ( She had indeed profited from it on several occasions . ) " I was wondering , dear lady " ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do me the honor of dining . I have no one with whom to celebrate my luck . " " But , of course , Colonel , it would be a great pleasure . " At that I really put my hand up to my mouth to see if the mustache were there . We both seemed to have learned parts in a play  --  I began to fear what the third act might hold . I noticed she was edging toward the restaurant of the Salle Priode , but all my snobbery revolted at dining there with so notorious a figure of fun . I said , " I thought perhaps  --  if we could take a little air  --  it 's such a beautiful evening , the heat of these rooms , some small exclusive place . . .. " I would have suggested a private room if I had not feared that my intentions might have been misunderstood and welcomed . " Nothing would give me greater pleasure , Colonel . " We swept out ( there was no other word for it ) and I prayed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cheap caf ? , it would have been intolerable if she had seen me at the moment . The woman imposed unreality . I was persuaded that to the white mustache had now been added a collapsible opera hat and a scarlet-lined cloak . I said , " A horse cab , do n't you think , on a night so haltny . . . . " " Barmy , Colonel ? " " Spelled with an L , " I explained , but I do n't think she understood . When we were seated in the cab I appealed for her help . " I am really quite a stranger here . I have dined out so seldom . Where can we go that is quiet .. . and exclusive ? " I was determined that the place should be exclusive : if it excluded all the world but the two of us , I would be the less embarrassed . " There is a small new restaurant  --  a club really , very comme it foot . It is called Orphee . Rather expensive , I fear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave the name to the driver and leaned back . As she was sitting bolt upright I was able to shelter behind her bulk . I said , " When were you last in Cheltenham ... " r " The devil was about us that night . Whatever I said had been written into my part . She replied promptly , " Dear Cheltenham . ho w did you discover .. ? " " Well , you know , a handsome woman catches one 's eye . " " You live there too ? " " One of those little houses off Queen 's Parade . " " We must be near neighbors , " and to emphasize our nearness I could feel her massive mauve flank move ever so slightly against me . I was glad that the cab drew up : we had n't gone more than two hundred yards from the Casino . " A hit highbrow , what ? " I said , glaring up as I felt a colonel should do at the lit mask above the door made out of an enormous hollowed potato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton which were meant , I suppose , to represent cobwebs . The little mom inside was hung with photographs of authors , actors , and film stars , and we had to sign our name in a book , thus apparently becoming life members of the club . I wrote Robert Devereux . I could feel her leaning against my shoulder , squinnying at the signature . T H E restaurant was crowded and rather garishly lit by bare globes . There were a lot of mirrors that must have been bought at the sale of some old restaurant , for they advertised ancient specialties like " Mutton Chopps . " She said , " Cocteau was at the opening . " " Who 's he ? " " Oh , Colonel , " she said , " you are laughing at me . " I said , " Oh well , you know , in my kind of life one has n't much time for hooks , " and suddenly , just under the word Chopp , I saw Cary gazing back at me .
