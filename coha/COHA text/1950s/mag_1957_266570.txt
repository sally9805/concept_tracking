One September day in 1840 the proud , independent-minded people of Maine woke up to find that they had changed their political complexion overnight . The Whig candidate for governor , Edward Kent , and his party 's candidates for Congress had upset the Democrats . Out of the victory came a new Whig battle cry for the national elections that were to follow two months later : <P> Oh , have you heard how old Maine <P> went ? <P> She went hell-bent for Governor Kent- <P> And Tippecanoe and Tyler , too ! <P> Sure enough , the old Tippecanoe River veteran , General William Henry Harrison , and his fellow Whig , Vice Presidential Candidate John Tyler , defeated Democratic Incumbent Martin Van Buren in the presidential race that November . Exulted the Whigs : " As Maine goes , so goes the nation . " <P> The slogan endured , despite the fact that in the 29 presidential elections since 1840 it has been wrong nearly half ( twelve elections ) the time . Cracked Democratic Strategist Jim Farley , after Franklin Roosevelt swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so goes Vermont . " <P> Last week Maine laid the slogan to rest . By a vote of 63,710 to 36,065 , the electorate of Maine decided to change the date of its elections . The basic reason for the old September date-the probability that hard winter weather and impassable , broken roads would keep most voters from the polls-had long since passed . Beginning in 1960 , on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November , as the nation goes to the polls for state and congressional as well as presidential elections , so will go Maine .
