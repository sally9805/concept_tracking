From the outside , the three blue-and-silver buses parked in front of the New York Stock Exchange this week looked like any other passenger buses . But inside , instead of seats , each had three offices filled with desks , radiotelephones , easy chairs , an outlet for a stock market ticker and a board listing 70 stocks . The buses bore the name Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Beane , the world 's largest brokerage house ( 113 offices ) , and they were the firm 's latest idea on how to bring Wall Street to Main Street . <P> Merrill Lynch hopes to use its freewheeling brokers to sell securities to suburbanites . Based in Chicago , Boston and Newark , the buses will tour five suburban areas around each city , hang out the Merrill Lynch shingle before supermarkets , factories and commuter stations . Sales men will hand out literature , lecture on the market , show new investors that they can buy stocks as easily as steaks . <P> The new Monthly Investment Plan , started by the Exchange two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merrill Lynch a taste of what can be done to get new investors . After a slow start , the idea has brought 10,885 new accounts to brokers . By spending $45,000 on advertising , Merrill Lynch grabbed off 40% of the new investors ( 4,411 accounts ) , now sees a booming market in such areas as San Antonio , Omaha , Indianapolis and Detroit . One small company opened five accounts at the maximum monthly sum of $999 because it found the plan an excellent way to bank surplus funds and collect attractive dividends ; another investor opened a $40-a-month account because he said he threw away that much money each month , wanted to discipline himself . <P> But mostly , the new investors were people who ordinarily never think about Wall Street as a place to put their savings . They included young married couples , factory workers , housewives with a few extra dollars of grocery money , G.I.s stationed abroad without much opportunity to spend their pay .                  @ @ @
