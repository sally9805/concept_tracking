Fallen after five months in office , several stays of execution : Premier Ren Pleven 's French coalition-of-the-center government . His was the eleventh French government ( usually with the same ministers changing chairs ) to fall during the lifetime of the Fourth French Republic . <P> The Socialists , who had supported the Pleven cabinet on most issues , deserted when the Premier asked the National Assembly to authorize economies designed to reduce the $400 million annual deficit of France 's nationalized railway system . That licked the motion-and the government-by a whopping 98 votes . <P> Outlook : probably a month or more of a caretaker government , during which the same ministers ( except the Premier and Minister of the Interior ) will carry on their jobs as if nothing had happened , followed by formation of another cabinet , presumably with much the same faces .
