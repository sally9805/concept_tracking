He had been promising himself this moment for how many lonely months and years on alien worlds ? Beneath him the clovered hill-slope was warm in the sun . Northwest Smith moved his shoulders against the earth and closed his eyes , breathing so deeply that the gun holstered upon his chest drew tight against its strap as he drank the fragrance of Earth and clover warm in the sun . Here in the hollow of the hills , willow-shaded , pillowed upon clover and the lap of Earth , he let his breath run out in a long sigh and drew one palm across the grass in a caress like a lover 's . He had been promising himself this moment for how long -- how many months and years on alien worlds ? He would not think of it now . He would not remember the dark spaceways or the red slag of Martian drylands or the pearl-gray days on Venus when he had dreamed of the Earth that had outlawed him . So he lay , with his eyes closed and the sunlight drenching him through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze through the grass and a creaking of some insect nearby -- the violent , blood-smelling years behind him might never have been . Except for the gun pressed into his ribs between his chest and the clovered earth , he might be a boy again , years upon years ago , long before he had broken his first law or killed his first man . No one else alive now knew who that boy had been . Not even the all knowing Patrol . Not even Venusian Yarol , who had been his closest friend for so many riotous years . No one would ever know -- now . Not his name ( which had not always been Smith ) or his native land or the home that had bred him , or the first violent deed that had sent him down the devious paths which led here -- here to the clover hollow in the hills of an Earth that had forbidden him ever to set foot again upon her soil . He unclasped the hands behind his head and rolled over to lay a scarred cheek on his arm , smiling to himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a green star high in alien skies , but warm soil , new clover so near his face he could see all the little stems and trefoil leaves , moist earth granular at their roots . An ant ran by with waving antennae close beside his cheek . He closed his eyes and drew another deep breath . Better not even look ; better to lie here like an animal , absorbing the sun and the feel of Earth blindly , wordlessly. * * * * * Now he was not Northwest Smith , scarred outlaw of the spaceways . Now he was a boy again with all his life before him . There would be a white-columned house just over the hill , with shaded porches and white curtains blowing in the breeze and the sound of sweet , familiar voices indoors . There would be a girl with hair like poured honey hesitating just inside the door , lifting her eyes to him . Tears in the eyes . He lay very still , remembering . Curious how vividly it all came back , though the house had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... He rolled over violently , opening his eyes . No use remembering her . There had been that fatal flaw in him from the very first , he knew now . If he were the boy again knowing all he knew today , still the flaw would be there and sooner or later the same thing must have happened that had happened twenty years ago . He had been born for a wilder age , when men took what they wanted and held what they could without respect for law . Obedience was not in him , and so --  As vividly as on that day it happened he felt the same old surge of anger and despair twenty years old now , felt the ray-gun bucking hard against his unaccustomed fist , heard the hiss of its deadly charge ravening into a face he hated . He could not be sorry , even now , for that first man he had killed . But in the smoke of that killing had gone up the columned house and the future he might have had , the boy himself -- lost as Atlantis now -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else besides . It had to happen , he knew . He being the boy he was , it had to happen . Even if he could go back and start all over , the tale would be the same . And it was all long past now , anyhow ; and nobody remembered any more at all , except himself . A man would be a fool to lie here thinking about it any longer . Smith grunted and sat up , shrugging the gun into place against his ribs .
