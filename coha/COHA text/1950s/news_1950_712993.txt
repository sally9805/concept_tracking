txt Crowds gathered arounn Bushman 's cage in Lincoln Park zoo late yesterday afternoon as the news spread that the great ape , favorite of millions for 20 years , was gravely ill . Most of them watched in silence as the 550 pound gorilla lolled or his back listlessly . Keepers wile came out from behind the enclosure were b es i e g e d with questions . " Is he in pain ? " one asked . " De you think he is going to die ? " A towheaded boy of about 1C walked up to Edgar Robinson , Bushman 's keeper since he came to the zoo . " Is Bushman really sick ? " he asked . Five Iffinues  --  Or a Year Two veterinarians who examined Bushman during the day said he appeared to have rallied from the deep depression into which he had sunk during the early morning . They attributed his improvement to doses of digitalis given in his food to stimulate his ailing heart and to mild salicylates given as a sedative . " He might die in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , " said Dr. Wesley Young , managing director of the Anti-Cruelty Society , and for many years the head veterinary at the zoo . Both Dr. Young and Dr. Lester Fisher , who succeeded Dr. Young as head of the zoo veterinary staff , agreed that the great ape was suffering from the combined effects of arthritis , heart disease , and old age . When they left the monkey house they left telephone numbers with Keeper Robinson and told him to call if there was any change in Bushman 's condition . Swings Up to Overpass At midnight Bushman was able to stand for the first time in 12 hours . Keepers opened an overpass leading to the summer outdoor cage , and Bushman , accustomed to sleeping on the overpass , managed to swing up there . The overpass is 10 feet above the floor . Robinson and Lear Grimmer , another keeper , were keepink , an all night vigil with- Bushman . Park district publicity men said they would issue bulletins .

Zoo officials explained that they did not want crowds of morbidly curious persons to gather . Furthermore , It was explained , they did not wish to interrupt the regular routine of Bushman 's life or shut him away with a curtain before his glass fronted cage . " He likes crowds and they seem to stimulate him , " said Fisher . It has been said that thefstrolling visitors have amused Bushman as much in the last 20 years as he has amused them . To . most visitors Bushman seemed little changed . In recent months he has been lethargic , spending most of his time sitting and staring a. the people who pass . The amazing tricks with which he charmed millions in his youth seemed to have been forgotten . Bushman 's collapse came after he was let out into his open air summer quarters east of the monkey house . He had been ailing for several days . It was hoped the fresh air , warm sunshine , and the feel of soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , Bushman flopped over on his back and lay motionless for some time . Tho nobody dared go Into the cage , they placed long poles across the bars so that Bushman could pull himself up . It appeared that his hind quarters were paralyzed . With much difficulty the big ape was helped up the steps and back into his cage . Dr. Fisher said Bushman appeared to have been afflicted with arthritis for several months . At 22 he is the oldest gorilla in captivity , said Fisher . One of his great rivals as a public attraction died last year at the age of 19 or 20-Gargantua of the Ringling Brothers &; Barnum &; Bailey circus . " Nobody knows what age a gorilla may attain in natural surroundings , " said Fisher , " but there 's no doubt Bushman has lived the full life span we could expect for a zoo animal . " Ca n't Risk Entering Cage Fisher said that even in his weakened condition it would be impossible to enter the cage to examine the ape or treat him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even if he were unconscious his reflexes might seriously injure a man . " We ca n't put a stethoscope on him or give him injections , " he said . " It 's theoretically possible to put him in an oxygen tent , but practically 1 do n't think we can do it . We ca n't even anesthetize him safely because we do n't know what dosage to use , and an attempt probably would end his life anyway . " Bushman came to Chicago In 1930 when he was 2 years old ; he was captured in the French Cameroon country of West Africa . Julius Buck , the rare animal collector , said he had lived in captivity in a native village for a year before he was sent on his way to America . Takes Trainer for Merry Romp He cost $3,500 and weighed 37 pounds when he arrived in Lincoln park . Ever since he came his closest friend has been his trainer , Robinson . Unlike Gargantua , who had a mate , Tito , Bushman has been kept from the society of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen him in the 20 years I have known him , " said Robinson . " He has been declining in health for the last two years . " For many years Bushman froliced with Robinson playing football and wrestling with him when the trainer took him out on a leash . In 1936 the 150 pound Bushman bolted and pulled the 180 pound Robinson down a flight of stairs . Robinson worked three hours wheedling him back into his cage , and was able to get out of the enclosure Only after patient waiting for the gorilla to get over his playful mood . Since then no one has ventured into the cage . There are four other gorillas in the zoo , all of them less than half grown . They are Sinbad , Lotus , Rajah , and Irving Young . With Bushman they make the largest collection of gorillas assembled in captivity , park district officials said .
