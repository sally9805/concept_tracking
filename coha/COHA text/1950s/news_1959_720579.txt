txt Federal Airways Chief Elwood Quesada told states they can expect little , if any , Federal money to help them pay for terminal buildings at airports . The aviation administrator laid down the policy in a statement prompted by President Eisenhower 's recent approval of a bill providing $125 million in Federal aid for airport construction over the next two fiscal years . Under the " broad discretion " given him by the new law , Mr. Quesada said he would pursue a policy " to nile out any terminal building construction which is not cleat ly essential to the safety , convenience or comfort of persons using airports for public aviation purposes . " The words " clearly essential " were underlined . " I can not say now that this policy will entirely eliminate Federal aid for terminal building construction , " the official added , " but I can say that no such construction will be approved by me as an eligible project cost if it means that a safety requirement must remain un.AtIqfloci " Mr Eisenhower had urged Congress , with Mr. QIIPARda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively for airport development work that rontributed to " increased safety of air travel " Rut Congress voted to allow the Federal Aviation Administrator to earmark some funds for projects he deemed essential for the " safety , convenience nr comfort " of travelers .
