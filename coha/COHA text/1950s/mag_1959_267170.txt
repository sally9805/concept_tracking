The book publisher sat in his spacious home in Norman , Okla. and swirled a glass of brandy . " There are no more hicks in America , " said Savoie Lottinville , 52 , head of the University of Oklahoma Press . " The cultural face of the continent has changed from concentration in New York and San Francisco . A great lot of the best ideas come from localities far removed from those great cities . " <P> Publisher Lottinville , onetime Rhodes scholar , speaks with authority . For 20 years , he has run his bustling , 40-man shop in the shadow of an oil derrick . Yet Oklahoma is known for more than oil . Over the years , its topflight press has published 426 books , ranging from the influential Plowman 's Folly ( 340,000 copies sold ) to last week 's Athens in the Age of Pericles , the first of an intriguing series on great cities . Oklahoma 's recent music books make it better known in Milan and Bonn than many a famed name on Manhattan 's publishers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Savoie Lottinville , " and we look to the whole . " <P> Publish or Perish . What is true of Oklahoma can also be said of university presses across the U.S. No longer content with murky monographs on the mud turtle , or the academic jargon of cloistered professors , the presses have become favorites of U.S. readers . This year the 50 members of the Association of American University Presses will produce 1,300 new books on subjects ranging from art to zoology . In their own field-adult , hardcover nonfiction-universities will account for one out of every four original books in the U.S. and sell them for about $14 million , more than double their income of ten years ago . <P> The sum may be small in big business terms , but it is significant in terms of growth and the new directions the presses are taking . Starting with the first U.S. press at Cornell in 1869 , university publishers long concerned themselves solely with faculty books too abstruse or too specialized for commercial publishers . For years , they plodded along producing the dusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perish " dictum started influencing a scholar 's status . Even then , the growth was slow . <P> Pros &; Prizes . The recent spectacular surge gets its impetus from the cold economics of postwar commercial publishing . Soaring costs have fostered the hit psychology of the Broadway theater , forced commercial publishers to shy away from nonfiction books that are likely to sell less than a break-even 8,000 copies . The university presses have no such profit-and-loss problems . As taxexempt , nonprofit enterprises , often bolstered by subsidies , they can afford to keep slow sellers in print as long as they prove useful . Result : more and more commercially marginal but eminently important books are being handed over to the universities . And the presses in turn are starting to attract first-rate editors and designers to give the works a professional shine . So improved are the book designs that about 25% of the selections at the annual books show of the American Institute of Graphic Arts are products of the university presses .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
