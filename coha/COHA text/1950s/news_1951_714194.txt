txt The House Appropriations Committee vetoed almost all of President Truman 's broad $400 million program for aiding victims of the recent Midwest flood disasters . Instead , the committee approved a different , much more limited program of its own . The President had asked a new $50 million flood insurance program . He had sought $160 million for a program of liberal loans over and above those now available through the various Government lending agencies . Finally , he had asked $100 m  --  llton for a program of indemnifying flood victims for loss or damage to real or personal property up to of the loss or up to a total payment of $20 000 per person . The Appropriations Committee turned down each of these and instead decided to work through existing programs and agencies It soted to increase the limit en RFC. disaster loans from $40 million to $100 million and to extend from 10 to 20 ; tears the time limit fixed by law on loans for acquisition and construction of housing . The committee said this would enable R F C. to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged or destroyed by the flood and enable them to put their homes in such state they can get extra credit if needed from regular banking and other loan sources Various Appropriations Voted The committee also voted an additional $18,440,000 for the Agriculture Department to help clear debris from flooded lands ? reestablish pastures and take other consemaDori measures . It appropriated another $30 million to the Disaster Loan Revolving Fund of the Farmers Home Administration of the Department of Agriculture to provide funds to replace or repair farm homes . livestock . buildings and equipment . Finally , it added another SS million to the President 's Emergency Disaster Relief Fund for use as he sees fit . The committee estimated the new appropriation bill , together with amounts already available through present programs . would make close to $257 million available for financial help in the disaster a : ea In rejecting the President 's program for new Flood Disaster Administration , the corn- mittee said it had been " confronted with a most unsatisfactory and inadequate presentation of the entire proposal . " It said no administration official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until almost a month alter it was first requested from Congress but that even now the committee has n't been filled in on some details of the program . Opposes New Agency It also said there is no legal authority for appropriating $400 million for a new separate agency , and therefore it said the committee has chre.en to gi  --  e extra money to agencies already exiting . On the subject of the President 's proposal for a direct indemnification program , the committee said such a program had never been authorized and would be " a major departure from the present concept of government . " It said the new idea would commit the Federal Government to a program of Federal responsibility which would result in an almost unlimited number of claims from victims of every disaster throughout the country regardless of type or size " The financial implications inherent in such an action mould he enormous .

It stated the reason private insurance companies have not been able to vs rite flood insurance is that this type of insarnrce is sought only by those exposed to floods and as a result It is not possible to spread the risk sufficiently to avoid prohibitively high premiums .
