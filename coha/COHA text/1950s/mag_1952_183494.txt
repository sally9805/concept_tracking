Tennis is traditionally considered a gentlemanly sort of sport , but last week 's annual meeting of the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association was boisterous enough to do credit to a baseball gathering of the Happy Chandler era . Item that produced the fireworks : the national rankings . <P> In its tentative rankings , released a month ago , the U.S.L.T.A. put Tony Trabert , national clay court champion , in the No. 1 spot . Vic Seixas , national grass court finalist , was ranked No. 2 . In the No. 3 slot : Australian and Wimbledon Champion Dick Savitt . After last week 's meeting , the ranking order was juggled in topsy-turvy fashion , but not before a lot of gratuitous advice had been thrown in from the sidelines . <P> The loudest talker was Frank Shields , non-playing captain of the losing U.S. Davis Cup team . Shields had ignored Savitt in the Davis Cup matches , had put his confidence in aging ( 30 ) Ted Schroeder ( ranked No. 7 ) , who turned out to be the goat of the series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was , at No. 3 . Cried Shields : " Never once in the past three months has Savitt looked like a champion . Not only that , but he was not the most cooperative player in the world while we were in Australia , and his sounding off brought discredit to the game . He was not a credit either as a player or a representative of America . " <P> Shields 's outburst brought a tart answer from Don McNeill , onetime ( 1940 ) national champion . Amid resounding applause from the assembled delegates , McNeill pointed out that players are ranked on their tennis ability , and personal prejudice should have nothing to do with ranking . The ranking committee , ignoring Shields 's remarks , proceeded to raise Savitt from No. 3 to 2 , dropped Trabert from 1 to 3 , elevated Seixas to the No. 1 spot . <P> After the heated session , one of the longest ( five hours ) in U.S.L.T.A. history , President Russell B. Kingman tried to restore a touch of dignity to tennis . Choosing his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most unseemly . " <P> Other unseemly tennis news last week : In Miami , a group of disgruntled , discarded U.S. Davis Cup players , headed by veteran ( 37 ) Gardnar Mulloy , challenged the losing U.S. team to a charity match . Several members of the five-man team denied knowledge of the challenge . But Mulloy stuck to it , explained : " The whole thing was based on the selection of Schroeder for the Cup team . " In Australia , while Frank Sedgman 's " wedding gift " fund ( TIME , Jan. 14 ) swelled to $11,892 , Aussie Davis Cup Captain Harry Hopman spoke out about " amateur " tennis in his Melbourne Herald column : " I do n't think there is one player in the world 's first ten who abides by the international amateur rules . . . Tennis today is in the semiprofessional class , and it should remain there . "
