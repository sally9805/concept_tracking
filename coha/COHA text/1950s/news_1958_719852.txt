txt Boston 's unpaid taxes  --  totaling 18.3 million dollars  --  have been the subject of enough fuss to obscure the real quarry for suspicion : back taxes that have been written off after a private settlement . For more than two months City Council requests for information on the amount and extent of these settlements have been ignored . The big question which ca n't be answered until the records are made public is whether or not certain taxpayers have received preferential treatment through generous settlements on delinquent taxes . At the instigation of City Councilor Gabriel F. Piemonte the council has asked Mayor Hynes and his corporation counsel for figures that would show : 1 . Whether or not the process of placing liens against ; and foreclosing , tax-due property is seriously delayed ; 2 . Whether or not large tax settlements are being made outside the public abatement process used for relieving current taxes ; 3 . Whether or not city officials are taking steps to protect the city 's interest in the value of properties to which it has taken title for nonpayment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council this information , however , William L. Baxter , city corporation counsel , and James E. Gildea , city treasurer , yesterday gave out some totals of delinquent taxes that failed to satisfy the searching councilors . The 18.3 million dollars still due the city in unpaid taxes includes 6.9 million dollars in " current taxes " - 1957 and 1958 . Since 1958 tax bills just went out , these are not considered delinquent until November . Another 6.3 million dollars represents " tax title " properties , whose collection has been handed over to the city 's legal department for action . It is in this category that the opportunity for private settlement arises . Unpaid excise taxes total 3.2 million dollars and date back to 1948 . But almost half are " current . " To get action on these , the collector 's department has sent to the Registry of Motor Vehicles to have 8,838 sets of Boston license plates canceled unless payment is made . Current ' Taxes Unpaid real property taxes amount to 5.06 million dollars . But again , about 4.7 million dollars ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And many ' back levies , dating back to 1936 are uncollectable . Many of these are properties long since taken over by the city , but lags in abatement bookkeeping prevent their being wiped off the record . Unpaid personal taxes amount to 2.6 million dollars . Delinqtient poll taxes total 1.1 million dollars , dating back to 1950 . Some 75,000 warrants are out for their collection . Generally , this backlog of tax arrears comes out looking considerably less black after current taxes and " bookkeeping en tries " of ancient uncollectable taxes are removed . But the catch comes in the 6.3-million-dollar item of - tax title " properties . In 1941 , after a legal decision in the so-called Cable Raincoat Case , " tax title " cases were taken out of the hands of the tax collector 's office and given wholly to the city 's legal department . It is that department which is now denying the City Council access to records of private tax settlements . Councilor Piemonte has questioned several points of the procedure now being followed . First he has sought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on delinquent properties one year after nonpayment of taxes as allowed by law and done by most cities , rather than waiting two . Second he has sought to find out why there have been delays in foreclosing properties , or why , alternatively , the legal department has not directly sued owners for payment when the owners were known to be receiving large sums of money from other sources . As examples he has cited the East Boston Corporation of Bernard Goldfine and the Boston Post property . It has also been reported that while the city was doing nothing to collect taxes owed on the Merchants and Miners Pier ( which burned recently , to the city 's loss of $1 , - 000,000 ) , the owner of that property received payment from the city for the eminent-domain taking of some of his land for the city 's Hayward Place Garage . Process Outlined Rumors continue to circulate in City Hall that some large property owners have repeatedly used the private-settlement method of disposing of back taxes . The process would work in this manner : Property owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes tax title . Then , before another two years go by and foreclosure is in sight , the owner settles his back taxes by arrangement with the legal department . The process is an abatement , but not one made on the public record , as are those abatements made on current taxes . After the settlement is concluded by a payment of the abated amount to the tax collector , the hypothetical property is free to start the cycle of nonpayment over again . ' What the City Council is seeking , through its requests for year-by-year figures , is to determine whether the city is losing millions of dollars in tax revenues and whether personal tax inequities exist under this private-abatement process . Councilor Piemonte has also sought to break the log jam on delinquent tax cases by court actions against owners and by streamlined auctioning of foreclosed properties . " If we can get all these tax-due properties out of the hands of City Hall and back onto the tax rolls , " he observes , " the situation will be much more clean cut all around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
