 | Your Day in Court Will It Be Fair ? By James Finan OUR CHANCE is one in eight this year of being haled before a judge somewhere in these United States , charged rightly or wrongly with any offense from a traffic violation to manslaughter . You will probably appear in a so-called lower court without a lawyer and look to the presiding judge for fair treatment. , Will you get it ? A recent survey in Michigan shows the kind of treatment you are likely to get . When the decisions of fee-paid judges in the lower courts of six counties were examined over a two-year period , it was found that the defendants had lost in all but eight tenths of one percent of the cases . But in Michigan higher courts , which are run by legally trained judges paid by salary instead of by fee , defendants . came out on top 35 percent of the time . A hardened criminal is more likely to get a fair day in court than you are . Lower courts handle the hulk of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most serious three percent to courts of higher jurisdiction . For most defendants lower courts are also the courts of last resort ; not one lower-court judgment in a thousand is appealed , according to the American Bar Association . The judges , many of them politicians devoid of legal knowledge and dependent for their fees upon finding the accused guilty , wield tremendous power . Such a judge , says one authority , has " more opportunities for evil or good in a week than a judge of the Supreme Court has in a month . He can nullify the actions of police , curb disorder or encourage it , be a terror to evildoers or a blessing . " Several New England and Middle  | Atlantic states have cleaned up their lower-court systems . California this January has followed suit . The core of their reform has been abolition of the numerous horse-and-buggy justices-of-the-peace courts , or . their equivalents , and expansion of the territory served by a single good court . Under this program even sparsely populated areas can support legally trained judges who are paid by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? which pioneered in overhauling its reeking lower courts in 1910 ? still offers the best example of how to make justice quick , decent and understandable to the common man who seldom can afford legal counsel . Perhaps the most significant and certainly the most interesting unit of the New York City system is Night Court . New YORK 'S lower-court setup is this : Some 5o magistrates , experienced lawyers appointed for tenyear terms , circulate as needed in a network of magistrates ' courts spread over the city 's five counties . After-dark arrests from all over the city funnel to the special central Night Court . Here , until midnight , arrested persons are speedily arraigned  --  thus saving many a citizen , whether subsequently acquitted or found guilty , an overnight jail wait simply to pay a small fine next morning , or exorbitant payments to bail-bond shysters to avoid the night 's disgrace . Last year Night Court handled 32,000 cases , disposing of 85 percent of them without imprisonment . Most were cleared up on the spot , others put over to day courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later appearance . " But do n't think Night Court exists to accommodate criminals , " Magistrate Ambrose J. Haddock said . " We 're here to get ordinary people home where they belong . " A case before Haddock seemed to prove his point . The defendant had been caught exchanging slips of paper with another man . The arresting detective , confident of the easy conviction of a numbers-game racketeer , produced a fistful of slips covered with figures admittedly in the defendant 's handwriting . Questioned by Judge Haddock , the accused man identified himself as manager of a dress-cutting shop in the garment district . The figures represented yardages of dress goods , he explained . Haddock dismissed the case , then said to me : " That man 's explanation created reasonable doubt as to his guilt . Therefore , the case was thrown out . To a policy-squad plainclothes man , possession of any slips with numbers on them is proof of guilt . Not to me . I 've spent 12 years on the magistrate 's bench , and before studying law I spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . Maybe I know . " WATCHING Haddock - and other magistrates at work showed me that a good lower-court judge brings  | More than a knowledge of law to his job . He needs everlasting patience and a warm understanding of people in all walks of life . " You ca n't just ask yourself , What law did these people break ? ' " one magistrate explained . " The main thing a lowercourt judge tries to find out is , What 's getting these people into trouble with their neighbors and the law ? ' Jail by itself is a pretty blunt instrument with which to try to solve a community 's problems . " Magistrate Morris Ploscowe let me occupy an inconspicuous chair behind his bench . Ploscowe is an internationally . known criminologist and court authority , executive director of the American Bar Association 's Commission on Organized Crime , and consultant to numerous crime probes . Jurists had recommended him as a fine example of how a good judge handles the infinite human problems of a crowded lower court . Ploscowe 's 20th case one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assault . The complainant was an angry-looking businessman with a purpling left eye . The court listened first to the arresting officer 's version of the fracas , then to the complainant 's . After perhaps 40 seconds of the injured man 's recital the judge broke in . " Just a minute , " he said in a sarcastic voice . " You do n't remember calling this man an ugly black baboon , as the officer testified . But your memory is quite vivid as to all the other facts ? is n't that strange ? " " It 's vivid as to the fact that he punched me in the eye , Your Honor , " the complainant protested . " Keep it vivid for next time , " Ploscowe advised , scribbling on the arrest papers . " As for you " ? he waggled an angry finger at the defendant ? " next time a citizen passes a red light and bumps your fender , write down his license number and tell the police . Swing those ham hooks once more and you 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from assault to disorderly conduct , Ploscowe suspended sentence and dismissed both parties with , " Get home to your families , men . Stop acting like children . " When they were gone he coinmented , " Tackling that case in terms of who 's right and who 's wrong would be foolish . That 's where a judge could be correct legally and a damn fool practically . Both men were wrong . The complainant might be liable in one court to a civil suit for car damages , in traffic court for reckless driving , in a third court for disorderly conduct . And the defendant certainly breached the peace ? after the other fellow called him names . But would four convictions serve a more useful purpose than none ? " Both men lost their - tempers , both were haled into court and bawled out . You may notice that I yell loudest at those whom I let go . " ANY COURT set up on a broad county- or city-wide basis has a good  | many community resources at its disposal . Religious and charitable organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend appropriate aid . Take the case of the young fellow who was brought before Judge Ploscowe for smashing the window of a saloon where the bartender had refused him a drink . " He was a nasty , snarling customer , " Ploscowe recalled . " But he was only TO , with no previous police record . And a probation investigator turned up evidence that the boy 's troubles seemed to date from the time he 'd applied for working credentials that required a birth certificate . His mother had always told him his father was dead . Now he discovered he was illegitimate . Then in an accident he lost his leg ; he got a poorly fitting artificial kg that caused him recurrent pain . He was a good carpenter , , but he pawned his tools and began drinking . " I referred him first to the state rehabilitation service for the crippled that got him a properly fitted limb . A member of Alcoholics Anonymous then went to work on him . Finally the rehabilitation service advanced enough money to get his tools out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks ago he came in to show me the nice young woman he 's going to marry . He seemed to be a totally different man . When I first dismissed his case he told me something I 'd never heard from a defendant before . I 'll be okay now , Judge , ' he said . The luckiest thing that ever happened to me was getting hauled into this court . ' " A LOWER-COURT JUDGE spends little time on serious misdemeanors and felony cases . These , if the evidence justifies holding the defend ant , are promptly shunted to higher courts for trial . But he will often go out of his way to settle minor disputes in which he lacks power to order what equity and common sense dictate . During one evening session three cases came up which Judge Ploscowe said he would hear in his chambers later . To me they seemed to have nothing in common . One involved five rough-housing high school boys who had broken the balcony railing in a Brooklyn movie theater , causing $45 damage . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player who lived on the floor below and broken the musician 's false teeth . In the third case an apartment  | landlord had allegedly slashed the tires of two automobiles whose owners had frequently parked them outside his building , blocking the entrance . In the magistrate 's chambers , from which the court stenographer is excluded , Ploscowe lectured the boys ' parents until they agreed to pay $45 to the theater manager for the balcony repairs . The - shorttempered neighbor soon decided that his safest course was to pay the accordion , player for the broken dental plate . In like manner the landlord grudgingly paid the auto owners $Ioo for tire damage , on their withdrawal of the criminal charges against him . The parkers volunteered to park elsewhere . Surely these solutions were simple enough : the defendants made good the money loss which they had caused the complainants to suffer . The striking fact is that these results could not have been achieved through regular criminal prosecution in any lower court . The defendants could not have been forced to pay damages ? only fines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to me . " But the court gets the money . Where 's the equity in that ? " Ploscowe explained that if a defendant refuses to pay damages in a case of this sort the judge can only send the parties to a civil court , even though the sums involved may not justify the time and money spent collecting them . " Settling squabbles backstage this way takes time , " he went on , " but it 's worth the trouble . Making people undo the damage they have done is a wonderfully corrective element of justice . Unfortunately , it is all too often neglected . " The lower courts are the greatest social force for the correcting of individual maladjustments and the prevention of crime in our civilization today . Even the overromantic subway " mashers " who appear in Night Court illustrate that fact . One such man , well dressed and respectable-looking , one evening in a crowded subway train had slipped his hand around a pretty girl 's waist . She had not welcomed his attention and he did not know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who patrol the city 's subways and theaters on the lookout for forward males . Now he was the picture of abject , utter embarrassment . A check showed that the man had no previous arrest record . Ploscowe 's questioning brought out that he was a family man , and an executive in a department store . " And you do n't have a lawyer in court ? " Ploscowe asked . The man shuddered . " I 'm too ashamed to get in touch with him , or anyone . This , well , it 's just horrible . " You are darned right , it 's horrible . The sentence is horrible , too , ' Ploscowe said . " Thirty days in the workhouse . " After the doom soaked in and the defendant felt his life crumble about his ears , Ploscowe added , " ? with execution of the sentence suspended during good behavior . " The man vanished out of the courtroom like a sigh . " I do n't think we 'll see him again , Your Honor , " said the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , any magistrate will throw the book at him plus the 30 days we remitted , " Ploscowe assured her . But there 's no use compounding the city 's misery by robbing the man of his family 's respect and his  | job . That might have happened if we could n't let him go home tonight . " LONG AFTER 12 one night , as the last case appeared , Judge Ploscowe looked up in surprise . " What 's this man doing in court in his pajamas ? " he demanded . " He refused to put his clothes on , Your Honor , " the arresting officer explained . " First he pushes this lady around , then he busts her furniture . When she calls the station house he ducks into bed . He defied me to bring him like he was . " The cop shrugged . " So I did . " The defendant glowered red-eyed from cop to judge . Flanking the patrolman was a tired-looking woman of 45 . " Lady , how long has this been going on ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad man . But every time he drinks it 's the same  - -  -  cursing and abusing me in front of the children . " " It 's time we found out why he 's drinking , madam , " Ploscowe said reasonably . " I will set this case over for a week , to hear it in Day Court , " Confidently the wife-beater lifted his chin . " And during that week , mister , " continued Ploscowe , " you will be held in city jail for a probation investigation . " As they led her pajama-clad spouse off to jail , the woman looked after him worriedly and started to cry . Judge Ploscowe beckoned her to the bench . " I put him in for week to give you a little rest , " Ii whispered gently . " Is n't that al right with you ? " The little woman swallowed her tears and conjured a fleeting smile , as if she felt it her duty to reassure this troubled magistrate . " Yes , judge , " she murmured . " After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coughed . " Thank you , he said . " I wanted to be sure . " When she was gone he repeated , " ' What else can we do ? ' ' Because in a time of trouble this woman had met with decency and warm under standing in a courtroom , she had spoken more eloquently than she knew , perhaps , of the closeness that should exist between humans in difficulty and the humans who judge them . What else the rest of us can do is to back the bar associations , state legislators and eminent jurists who for years have been urging the improvement of justice in our lower courts . Charles Evans Hughes , former Chief Justice of the U. S. Supreme Court , expressed the stern need : " Justice in the minor courts -- the only courts that millions of ou people know administered without favoritism by men conspicuous J for wisdom and probity , is the best 1 assurance of respect for our institutions . The Supreme Court of . the United States and the courts of appeals will take care of themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand most in need of justice . " '
