In a memorable speech last week before the National Religion and Labor Foundation in New York , newly elected A.F.L.-C.I.O . President George Meany bluntly scored some U.S. liberals and international neutralists for avoiding the facts of 20th century political life . Excerpts : <P> " Too many in the free world fail to see the real nature of Communism as the mortal foe of everything that we hold dear , of every moral and spiritual value . Too many are still prisoners of the illusion that Communism is , historically speaking , a progressive system . . . extreme liberalism temporarily making bad mistakes . Actually , Communism represents darkest reaction . It is an anti-social system in which there are embedded some of the worst features of savagery , slavery , feudalism and life-sapping exploitation manifested in the industrial revolution of early-day capitalism . <P> " Too many in the free world seem to have lost their capacity for moral indignation against the most brutal inhumanities when they are perpetrated by Communists . It is painful , but we must face the cruel facts of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our country who call themselves liberals are stone silent about the Soviet concentration camps . They never find the time to utter a word of condemnation against the Communist imperialist destruction of the national independence and democratic rights of hundreds of millions of people in Europe and Asia . <P> " One would expect the true liberal to cry out in protest . Communism is the deadliest enemy of liberalism . Liberals should be the most consistent and energetic fighters against Communism . Liberals must also be on guard against developing a certain type of McCarthyism of their own . They must shun like a plague the role of being anti antiCommunist . Only by refusing to be thus entrapped can liberals shed every vestige of subconscious and conscious regard for Communism as a movement with which they have something in common . <P> " No country , no people , no movement can stand aloof and be neutral . Nehru and Tito are not neutral . They are aides and allies of the Communists in fact and in effect , if not in diplomatic verbiage . <P> " The conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It overshadows all other problems . This conflict mirrors our age , its toils , its tensions , its troubles and its tasks . On the outcome of this conflict depends the future of all mankind . I pray that , on the threshold of the atomic age , we of the free world can muster the moral courage and total strength to preserve peace and promote the freedom of the men and women of every continent , color and creed .
