ending a loved one to the hospital can be a frightening ex-Sendin particularly for a wife and mother . Of course , if it 's polio or a heart attack or t. b. ? anything physical  --  she generally has a trusted physician on whom to rely . But when mental illness strikes , the wife too often finds herself standing alone . At least , this has been my experience over the past twelve years with my mentally ill husband . I hope my story wo n't he taken as an attack on the profession of psychiatry . Psychiatrists are a much-misunderstood group of conscientious men and women , desperately overworked because of the shortage in their numbers . I do n't want to lessen public faith in their capacity to heal . In brief , my quarrel is not with **27;535;TOOLONG , but with **26;564;TOOLONG , and it is in the belief that my criticism is constructive that I have decided to speak up . My husband is a manic-depressive . That is , he suffers from manic-depressive psychosis  --  a form of mental illness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of depression and lethargy . It is said to be a " functional " illness , in that no organic basis for it can be found . Heredity does not play a significant role , as people once believed , though doctors have uncovered some evidence that there may he pre disposing factors . ( Continued on Page 103 ) 1 learned this much fifteen years ago in a semester of abnormal psychology at college . I was majoring in education , with a minor in psychology , and I felt myself to be very interested . But the textbook phrases seemed entirely remote from my life . When Jack arrived at our college the next fall as a transfer from Harvard , I saw nothing in his alternating moods of gaiety and despair , his bewildering switches from extravagance to penny-pinching , to warn me away . Jack was a tall , handsome boy , a good student and a good athlete . By the spring of 1943 we were in love . Jack said that he wanted to ask me to marry him , but first he had something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of his sophomore year in Harvard  --  mental illness , to be frank . He had been in a sanitarium for a couple of months . For a year afterward he had gone to a Doctor K. for psychotherapy while he lived with his mother in Cambridge and worked at a defense plant . Doctor K. had concluded that Jack 's illness was precipi  --  tated by the death of his father , whom Jack had secretly hated . Jack felt that he under  --  stood himself much better after the year of treatment , and that he would therefore never become ill again . In fact , he was furi  --  ous at the Cambridge draft board for giving him a 4F on the basis of this one episOde . Perhaps I should have been wary , but I really wanted to marry jack and so was in  --  clined to share his optimism . In June we both graduated and hurried out to my home in the wheat belt , where the wedding wok place . The first sign of the return of Jack 's troubles came just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Coast city . Jack , who planned to go into industrial relations , had a personnel job in a defense plant . and I was enrolled at the university for my mas  --  ter 's degree in education . The summer of 19.14 was hot , and our life was wearing , for I was trying to finish at summer school and Jack often had to work overtime . At first I blamed these circumstanctm for Jack 's in  --  creasing irritability . But I began to worry when his hostility toward senior personnel officers at the plant seemed to obsess his thoughts . They were a bunch of fools , he said ; if they would only apply elementary prin  --  ciples of group psychology , they could easily solve the labor problems which plagued them . One day he came home and announced that he had given the president of the firm a report on the situation . " And I told him where he could go with the report if he did n't put it into effect , " he said happily . I was flabbergasted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house , threatening never to return . He was brought home at three A.M. , very drunk , by some workers at his plant . Mingled with the odor of whisky I detected the smell of cheap perfume . I wept , and started a letter to my parents , and planned the things I would tell him in the morning  --  for instance , that I was expecting a baby next spring . But I never got a chance to say a word , for at six the next morning , bright-eyed and un  --  repentant , jack went roaring off in the car . Su began a two-week period the like of which I had never known before , but was often to know again . Jack was on the go every minute of every day , giving parties , negotiating at the plant to get his ideas adopted , drinking constantly , eating and sleeping scarcely at all , and talking , talk  --  ing , talking all the time . My slightest re  --  monstrance caused him to fly into a violent temper . Somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take my final exams , but at the end I was near collapse . The day Jack was fired from the plant he came home in high spirits . He was n't worried about our financial position , for he knew he could get a job anywhere now . Though he was angered by the insult to his idea  --  he was beginning to call it The Idea  --  he was sure time would prove him right . Actually , he said , he saw now that it was his mission to pound The Idea into the thick heads of all American personnel men , " What I 've got to do best , " he an  --  nounced , " is to get an eminent psychiatrist to underwrite this . And by ' eminent ' I mean someone like Doctor K .. " And he told me that he was planning to drive to Cambridge the very next day . 1 had been thinking about calling Doctor K. myself . That Jack should want to talk to him too seemed a miracle . I eagerly of  --  fered to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marish . Jack drove almost straight through , drinking and quarreling with filling-station attendants all the way . I was in a fog of exhaustion when we reached Cambridge , but Jack made for his mother 's telephone 103 and called Doctor K. I thought , He 's des  --  perate to get help . Doctor K. would n't see him ; he said he had a full schedule of patients , and was off to Maine next week . I wept in disappoint  --  ment . So , frighteningly , did Jack . His sobs so alarmed his mother that she called an old friend and persuaded him to finagle an appointment with Doctor K. It was to be for the following Tuesday . Jack put in the time drinking and brawling and making appointments with Harvard and M. 1 . T. professors . I watched the clock hour ( Continued on Page 1051 February 25 , I95t3 ( Continued from Paire 103 ) after hour , living for the moment when I could get him into Doctor K. 's hands . By this time I was convinced that Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would persuade him to go voluntar  --  ily to a mental hospital , as he had done during Jack 's first illness . All I knew then about commitment procedures was that a voluntary commitment for a limited time was quick and easy . And I knew that only a skilled psychiatrist could persuade a master-of-the-world manic to submit him  --  self to treatment . The visit was a failure . The doctor saw us together  --  Jack said he wanted inc to witness the vindication of The Idea . While Doctor K. was courteous , he made it clear that he regarded the whole affair as art im  --  position . For Jack was using every resource clan extremely bright man to convince the doctor that he was actually sane , Before keeping the appointment , Jack had taken two phenobarbital pills , and sitting there in the office he put on a performance that would have fooled any layman . His body was relaxed , his speech coherent . Cleverly , he shifted blame for the visit to me , imply  --  ing that it was I who wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only the con  --  tinuous flow of his words would have given him away to an expert . Doctor K. was an expert , and I expected him to go into action . Instead , he heard Jack through to the end , nodded in wise agreement with The Idea , and patted us on the back when we left . ? " Your Jack has made a marvelous re  --  covery , " he told me in Jack 's hearing . " You must n't be overanxious about him . " " But , Doctor K. ? r ? " He gave me a look with which 1 would later become quite familiar . It said , " I am the expert , you arc the layman . In addi  --  tion , as a relative of the patient you arc by definition prejudiced . Little you can say has any value to me . " There was nothing to do except face the nightmarish trip back to the West Coast . By the time we reached home , Jack was drinking a quart of whisky a day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Presi  --  dent Roosevelt and John L. Lewis . When  --  ever I tried to get a word in edgewise , he threatened to slap me . At home , after a few hours ' sleep , I slipped away and , through the university , got in touch with a Doctor P. I guess I was scared enough to be convincing , for my story prompted the doctor to say he thought Jack should be in the hospital for observation for a few days . Would I bring him to the university hospi  --  tal at two o'clock that afternoon ? " Mc bring him ? " I gasped . I had visual  --  ized white-jacketed men coming for Jack in a little red wagon . But this is a common mistake . In my experience , private hospi  --  tals do not send attendants after patients , although in sixteen states the state hospital is required by law to do so . Nor can the police be called upon in the absence of ( 1 ) legal moves for an involuntary commit  --  ment , or ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hire an ambulance or special psychiatric nurses , but either pro  --  cedure is expensive and few families learn that such help exists until it 's too late . As Doctor P. made clear tome then , and other doctors have made clear since , it is up to the family to get the patient , however vio  --  lent , to the hospital . This time it turned out to be fairly easy , for by afternoon Jack 's speech was incoher  --  ent , his actions bizarre and he did n't seem to know what he was doing . Fred , a friend from the plant , drove us to the hospital . Jack thought he was signing a labor-management agreement when he wrote his name on the voluntary-commitment form . There is no known cure for manic-depressive psychosis , Electro-shock therapy has been used to shorten both the manic and the depressive phases , but the medical consensus now is that it has little perma  --  nent value . Many manic-depressives have been helped to ride the wave of their mood fluctuations through psychotherapy , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some are not accessible to this sort of help . A very few have benefited from deep analysis during their psychotic period , but this procedure is extremely expensive and time-consuming . Currently , medical atten  --  tion is centered on new drugs such as chlo r  --  promaz inn and reserpine , which seem to have some calming effect during the manic phase . All this I have learned in the past eleven years . In the fall of 914 , however , electro  --  shock was in its heyday ; there was some hope that it would actually cure psychosis . Jack was in the university hospital for al  --  most a month , receiving shock on a heavy schedule . Within a week he was almost back to normal , ready to admit that he had been ill and sorry for the trouble he had caused me . He expressed the hope that science would lick this thing yet . All we had to do was sit tight and keep our chins up . I yielded once more to Jack 's optimism . But the phone call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in and discuss Jack 's illness and its prognosis  --  never came . My only communication with this gentle  --  man was in regard to monthly payments on his steep bill . On the day of Jack 's dis  --  charge a staff doctor gave us a pep talk . We should plan a normal life , on the assump  --  tion that Jack 's illness would never return or , if it did , could be quickly shocked away . Jack suffered a mild depression all that winter , but he was able to hold down an assembly-line job in a defense plant , I worked in the city department of educa  --  tion until April , when our first child , MO , was born . It took us all winter to pay off the doctors and the hospital bills . We had a relatively calm summer , and in the fall moved to a Western university city , where Jack enrolled for his master 's degree in busi  --  ness administration . All through the three years we spent there we were broke . We had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whatever part-time jobs he or I could pick up . But our low-cost diet did n't affect our fertility ; Johnny was born in May of to47 , and hit little brother , Dicky , was an unplanned addition in August of 0.18 . I 'll never forget that August . On the fifth came the baby . On the seventh , Jack 's degree . On the eighth an offer of a job in an industrial plant in Texas . Jack had been elated all summer , but the night of the eighth , when hr came to the hospital smell  --  ing of liquor , I saw a difference in him that set my heart pounding . When I came borne from the hospital on the twelfth I found my mother there , white with fatigue . Ann and Johnny were wild with tension , and the apartment was a shambles . Jack had been giving it drinking party every night , and it was clear to me that he was off again . Jack , who is normally gentle and consid  --  erate , took no account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He demanded that I enter into the wild round of social activities that characterizes his hypomanic phase . Instead of showing appreciation for my mother 's help in our house , he implied that her pres  --  ence was a form of interference . At the end of ten days he announced that we would all drive grandmother home . To accommo  --  date the whole crowd , he said , he had just traded in our ancient and battered sedan for a new station wagon . Our bank balance showed 2.67.14 . The new job did not start until September first . I tried to point out that we would have to borrow to get through the month and move to Texas , even without car payments . He shouted me down in front of our white-faced children . Never argue with a manic , never cross him . To save the children wit  --  nessing any more scenes , and to avert possi  --  ble violence . I gave in . By the time we reached my parents ' home I had been out of the hospital only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on top of all my anxieties I had the twenty  --  faur-hour responsibility of caring for a new baby , Dicky registered his protest at the sort of life he was living by screaming day and night ; the older children were impossi  --  ble . I was so near the breaking point that I simply let go for a couple of days , without trying to look ahead . By the time l could rally my forces , Jack 's condition had be  --  come so much worse that I knew it was going to be very hard to get him to the hos  --  pital peacefully . And I knew he must go . This takes a bit of explaining . The de  --  scent of an individual into a psychotic epi  --  sode is a matter of the deterioration , grad  --  ual or rapid , of his capacity to test his ideas against reality , his judgment and his in  --  sight . At a certain stage in his illness Jack knows he is getting sick ; a few days later , when his symptoms arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the rest of the world is sick . I try to get him to a psychiatrist while he still realizes that he needs help . And I try to get the psychiatrist to suggest to Jack that he go to the hospital voluntarily . The cum  --  bersome legal procedures which most states require for involuntary commitment are too slow . . There arc excellent reasons for the laws , but the delays built into this process mean that Jack always reaches the violent stage before he can be hospitalized . So this time at my parents ' home I was anxious to find a doctor who would talk Jack into go  --  ing to the hospital under his own steam . Icalled our family doctor . The only psychiatrist he knew was famous for giving shock treatment rather indiscriminately . But Jack hated and feared shock by now , so I knew he would n't go to this man . I called the State Mental Hygiene Commit  --  tee and got the name of a Doctor M. , with whom I made an appointment . We went through virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K. Doctor M. listened courteously to my story over the phone . He made a noncommittal remark when I said I felt sure that Jack was within a day or two of going off the deep end . When Jack went to see him , Doc  --  tor al . evidently did n't mention hospitaliza  --  tion . To be sure , Jack came home with a prescription for a sedative and an appoint  --  ment for the next morning , but by night he was so far gone that he would n't consider keeping an appointment with any " stupid psychiatrist . " I called Doctor M. He told me to bring Jack to the hospital the next morning . But Jack was now more experi  --  enced , and " hospital " was linked with " shock " in his mind . He would n't budge . My suggestion that he was again sick so angered him that he knocked me down and began to hurl the furniture about . I was frightened . As soon as I could get away from him , 1 smuggled the children out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and left Jack raging alone . It was now two a.m . The whole neighborhood was roused by the noise , and I had no trouble finding a household that would receive the children and let me use the phone . My call woke Dortur M. from a sound sleep . He sounded gruff at first . Finally , when I had convinced hint that the situation was seri  --  ous , he suggested calling an ambulance . So here at last were my men in white jackets . Standing down the street at five A.M. , I saw them filing into the house , four of them , accompanied by two policemen . A tremendous battle could be heard in my mother 's house . The front door flew open and Jack raced out , half naked . The whole neighborhood watched as is burly cop wrestled him into the ambulance with the help of attendants . That was Round Two for me , Round Three for Jack . At the hospital , the routine was much the same as it had been on the West Coast . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Jack were physically ill , I kept thinking , it would n't be this way . The doctor would discuss the case with me  --  plans for Jack 's treatment , what to do to protect the children from their father 's disease , how best 1 could manage during the period of crisis . This sort of active inter  --  est used to be a part of medical practice and medical ethics . I have never met it in all roy years of dealing with psychiatrists . No one has ever taken notice of the exhausted , dis  --  traught condition in which I came to him . No one has ever suggested , say , that I bring our harassed children to a child-guidance clinic for a checkup . Has mine been an isolated experience ? I think not . During the long hours I 've spent in the waiting rooms of menial hospitals , I have talked to relatives of many other pa  --  tients . With few exceptions , they knew nothing about the nature of their loved ones ' illnesses , although some were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth episode . How can the isychia  --  trists expect to create public understanding of mental illness if they neglect to inform their patients ' families ? Is it better to spend an hour lecturing at a women 's club or thirty minutes enlightening one desperate housewife ? No doubt Mere are competent , ulna-kn . Mats psychiatrists who give the patient 's family the advice and reassurance they so desperately need . 1 W119111 lucky enough to find that kind . During this third hospital  --  ization of , fack 's , fill ' instance , I saw the doctor just twice : once to recite the case history and give permission for shuck ther  --  apy ; once more to receive platitudinous well wishes three weeks later , when I came to the hospital to take Jack home . The firm in Texas accepted Jack 's state  --  ment that ill health would delay his report  --  ing for work . My parents borrowed money on their house so we could consolidate our debts . In the new . Texas town we found a cheap duplex to rent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local high school . For two years Jack 's pendulum swung between mildly and severely depressed . In this state he could only turn in a routine performance on the job , and he won no promotions . On the other hand , we stayed on a budget . By the spring of ' 51 , when the next blowup came , we were almost out of debt . I was an old hand by this time and I saw die preliminary signs of a manic phase . The people at the plant , though , were delighted with the increased efficiency Jack always manifests as he swings into high . Within a month he was given a more responsible job and a considerable raise . The country-club set discovered us , and they thought Jack , with his increasing gaiety and sociability , was wonderful , simply wonderful . That 's a feminine expression . I 'd known during earlier episodes that there had been other women , but this was the first time Jack Ilaunted them under my nose . In June lie suddenly announced that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some business friends . I could n't stop him . As a result , Jack wound up its a Canadian jail , then in a Canadian mental hospital . The company was kind . They paid us sick leave for the six weeks Jack was in hospital , and offered him a re  --  search job in a Midwestern plant at a slight reduction in pay . There was one condition : they had gone over Jack 's case at the na  --  tional office with a consulting psychiatrist and he had suggested that Jack might ben  --  efit from further psychotherapy . Would Jack agree to treatment as soon as we were settled in the new town ? Of course , Jack had wanted to have more psychotherapy for years , but we had never felt able to afford it . Now the pinch was going to be worse , for we faced a pay cut and expected a new baby , due in March . Shortly after we moved to the Midwest  --  ern city , Jack began going to Doctor D. At fifteen dollars a half hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep us broke . I had to go back to work , taking out only six weeks for the arrival of little Sue . Jack did n't seem to benefit much from the psychotherapy . He was too old , Doctor D. explained , and had too many verbal de-lenses . I had the feeling now that Jack was never really sane . Twice his depression reached such depths that he had to take shock treatments on an out-patient basis . There were other troubles too ; my Ann was beginning to display behavior problems at school , and the two boys were sick most of the time . But Doctor D. was always willing to listen to my worries over the phone , and for three years I had a wonderful feeling that someone really cared about us . In the early summer of 1954 , Jack began to come out of a winter-long depression and display rapidly mounting excitement . The speed with which his mood climbed from day to day , a glazed brilliance to his eyes , warned me that this was going to be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several times to express my growing appre  --  hension , but he tended to take a brighter view , He pointed out that Jack had escaped reaching all acute stage twelve months ago , and might be able to ride the wave again . Every effort should be ' nude to keep him out of the hospital , so he would gain confidence in his capacity to stay sane . 1 agreed , but I did point out that I had known Jack fur thirteen years , and that his peaks had been coming at three-year inter  --  vals with terrifying regularity . " Well . Ie sure he comes in for his weekly appointments , and I 'll watch him closely , " Doctor D. said . " I think we 'll have him through this Ming before I leave un vaca  --  tion . " I do n't know why the word " vacation " did n't register . Three weeks later , when I called Doctor D. to toll him that Jack seas now psychotic , I %ANIS connected with a telephone-answering service . The girl said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of September . No , he had not left the name of another doctor whom I could ring in his absence . I slammed down the phone . In what other branch of medicine , I asked myself , would a doctor leave a seriously ill patient to fend for himself while he went off on a two-month vacation ? Doctor D. had seemed kind and interested , but I felt we were get  --  ting a poor return for the hundreds of dol  --  lars we had paid him . But anger was a luxury I could n't afford . Instead , I had to act quickly to protect our children , and the neighbors too . Most of our friends were out of town for the sum  --  mer , but there was one couple living near  --  by with whorl we had been fairly friendly . Bob worked in the personnel office at the plant , so I felt he might be able to help . That evening , while Jack was out drinking , I went around to son Bob . and his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling them the whole story . Bob knew a psychiatrist who occasionally served as consultant at the plant , and he promised to set up an appointment . 11'hen I got home , Jack was there , suspi  --  cious and quarrelsome . I persuaded him that we ought to go together to a psychic . trist , to find out if Jack was right in accus  --  ing me of being neurotic . He agreed to go with me to sec Doctor B. Later , out of Jack 's hearing , I put in a call to Doctor B. I tried to keep my voice calm as I outlined the situation , and I avoided mistakes I had made in the past . You never tell a psychiatrist what your bus-band 's illness is ; you only list symptoms . And you never , never tell him what you think should be done , But I did warn him that Jack had tricked other doctors into believing him sane . I might as well have saved nay breath . Jack found an old bottle of phenobarbital , took four pills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pulled the same old stunt . Doctor B. adroitly shifted the conversation from my problems to Jack 's problems , so I knew he saw something was wrong . But he dismissed Jack with an appointment for the next day . The doctor gave me no time alone with him . 1 feared another night with Jack , but there MIS nothing to do but go home . On the way , Jack had a fight with a policeman . That evening he showered ob  --  scenities on an old lady , a neighbor , who came to inquire about her cat . At supper he announced that he had just ordered a brand-new combination TV set . I slipped away to tell Bob what was up , and to ask him to call Doctor B. Next morning Bob reported that Doctor B. would n't sug  --  gest hospitalization to Jack . He thought Jack might pull out of his excited state in a couple of weeks if he could have the lave and security of his home to rely on . Bob was indignant . " What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't they need love and security too ? Who is going to treat their neuroses twenty-five years from now ? I thought these birds were supposed to be interested in preventive psychiatry . " Ibis words echoed my own thoughts ; still , Doctor B. 's statement affected me strongly . 111 could get through another week or so , was it possible that I could help Jack to live within the bounds of his illness ? If so , no sacrifice seemed too hard to bear . Relays of my friends had been keeping the children out of the house for much of each day by inviting them to the movies , to picnics , to go swimming . If they could keep it up , the children might be spared ugly scenes that I could endure . February .2,5 , 1956 Bob disagreed . He urged me to sec about legal commitment procedures , but I wa  --  vered . And Doctor B. , it seemed to me , encouraged me to waver . I went to sec him , and spoke to him twice over the phone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sion about hospitalization was entirely up to me . I tried to tell him that I felt laymen must rely on doctors to judge the severity of any sickness ; that I could n't make deci  --  sions without authoritative advice . Doc  --  tor B. was unresponsive . In fact , he confused me by saying that as Jack 's analyst he could take no part in making long-range plans for Jack 's treatment , and since this plan  --  ning should be done immediately , I must consult another psychiatrist at once . What did long-range planning mean ? Perhaps Doctor B. was thinking of hospital  --  ization after all , but he never made this clear . At any rate , the new psychiatrist to whom he referred me could n't see me until Friday . Thursday morning , when I awakened from sleep , Jack was standing over me with the fire tongs . " You know , " he said , " I could bash your head in . And I may yet . Now get up and make my breakfast . " He was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His speech was disorganized , and he seemed to be listening to interior voices as he wandered about the house , half clad , bursting into snatches of song . The children were terrified . Before breakfast was over he had slapped Ann in the face and thrown Johnny clear across the room . After break  --  fast he went into the back yard to practice handstands . At last I could call Doctor B. " I 'll see Jack today , " he said , " but only if he 's accompanied by a strong male at  --  tendant . " What about hospitalization ? " It 's the family 's responsibility to get him to a hospital . " So that was that . In tears , I called Bob and reported what Doctor B. had said . He told me to take the car and drive the chil  --  dren out of town . He would call the police and look up another psychiatrist and see what could be done . This was a lot of help to accept from a casual friend . But whom had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betty offered to bring her kids and go with us . We put in a long , weird day at a state park , staring at each other across a picnic table while the children tried to play as though nothing were wrong . When we got some at five o'clock , it was all over . Bob had found a psychiatrist who was willing to go to the house with a police escort , ask Jack the necessary questions and sign commitment papers . Then , after a battle royal , the cops hauled Jack off to jail . I signed commitment papers at the precinct station , and the police took Jack to the hospital . So that was Round Four . The doctor who committed Jack quickly presented me Witt is stiff bill , and the hospital to which he sent Jack was so expensive that I de  --  cided after a few weeks to have him trans ferred to the state hospital . This move , which I had always regarded with horror , may yet prove to be the best thing for us Jack improved faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital . They started him on the new drug therapy in which some psychiatrists have such great hopes . He has been out for nine months now , and has remained stable in his mood for a longer period than he has in years . Best of all , through the state hospital have found the sort of help I have needed all these years . Jack , technically on parole from the hospital , is under the supervision of the county clinic . Once a month he goes to see the psychiatrist to be checked in his mood as well as his medication . It is ar  --  ranged that I call the clinic if I see any danger signals . These doctors deal con  --  stantly with psychotics , and hear story after dreary story of their relatives ' trou  --  bles , I feel that they will be more inclined to take my word about Jack 's condition than the psychiatrists who came before them . I do n't know for sure , but I can hope . When Jack goes in for his monthly checkup , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had read a good deal about psy  --  chiatric social workers , but in all my years of getting Jack in and out of hospitals these are the first I 've ever seen . Miss Clausen has helped me in many ways , from suggest  --  ing a good source of baby-sitters to leading me to we that I was motivated by irrational feelings of guilt in my anxiety over Jack . But I should have had her assistance before Jack went to the hospital , to serve as interpreter between me and the doctor , to help inc in reaching decisions and making arrangements . The psychiatrist has to concentrate on the patient . I can understand that . On the other hand , it seems to me that the psychia  --  trist has a doctor 's responsibility to the family and to the community . Perhaps he should hire a social worker to sit in his office and deal with distraught relatives . Or he might affiliate himself with a clinic where he could work as part of a team at  --  tacking total family situations . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sources of help . Of course , it 's not my job to tell psychia  --  trists what to do . I can only assure them that they do have a problem . Unless they find some way to protect mothers and chil  --  dren and whole neighborhoods from such frightening experiences as we have known , each mental patient will be a source of bad public relations for their profession , and a cause of psychological wounds that turn children into little neurotics and psychotics . And no psychiatrist in his right mind wants that . THE END
