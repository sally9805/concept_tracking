Aufwiedersehen Abend A Story by Kay Boyle 1 T WOULD be possible to divide them into two nearly equal categories , the American civilians who came to work in Germany . There were those who came because of the varying ways and means of profit , or the illusion of power , which this Occupation employment offered ; and there were those who had returned to what had been their homeland once , American citizens now , but still German enough to believe that they alone could draw near to , and perhaps cure , the country 's ailing heart . The odd ones , who fitted under neither of these two heads , might be disposed of as fanatics . Some of them were young men who had left Stateside colleges to fight the war , and who had learned in mud , and blood , and combat , a lesson so violent that they had no patience left for classroom or campus . They had severed themselves from their home towns , and their people , and the girls they would go back to and marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to this country , but not as soldiers , not in uniform , but as civilians with a mission , having accepted both war and peace as their responsibility . One of the men of this odd minority was a young man named Rod Murray , who had come out of the Middle West on the common errand of reorientation , come seeking the look of sincerity in other men 's faces , and the sound of truth in their voices when they described the roles that they had played . He had been a bomber pilot once , and now his name , and his title as information Services ' Officer , were stenciled on an office door in a building designated as American Military Government in an ancient university town . The town , with its Schloss and its medieval halls of learning , stood solidlyand picturesquely , built to outlast all wars , it seemed , and all orientation , upon a Hessian hillside . When the work of the day was over , and the Military Government offices closed , Rod Murray did not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he did not sit in a movie hall with his arm around a Friiulein , because this quest for the freedom-loving and the enlightened could know no respite until it had reached some kind of end . The name of love might have been given to the search , but it was more dedicated than any pursuit of woman , this fateful seeking in an alien country for men with whom free men might have affinity . Rod Murray could be seen of an evening in the town hall of one or another of the Kreis villages , sitting among the rural storekeepers , and the farmers who had come in from the land to hear the BUrgermeister and the Landrat speak . And when the Biirgermeister and the Landrat would have had their say , and the men and the few women present would begin to leave , Rod Murray would jump up and seek to make his protest heard , and not succeed , and climb up on a chair to say it , standing tall and slouch-shouldered and a little too heavy in his gray tweed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job for which his government paid him , but simply part of man 's commitment to his fellow man . " Say , this is an open forum ! " he would call out loudly , and without fear , in his shameless rendering of their traditional tongue . " Now it 's the time when questions are asked ! " he would try to say , as he combed his fingers wildly through his dark , crisp , wavy hair . And the storekeepers , and the peasants , the women among them wearing MAGAZINE their regional dress , would turn their heads to stare at him , not in censure , - or in ridicule , but merely stare , their bland eyes vacant even of curiosity . And Rod Murray would jump down from the chair , and shoulder his way forward to where the Biirgerrneister and the Lan drat would be patting on their heavy coats . " This is the time for the people to ask you questions about the local administration ! " he would cry out in his ringing voice . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you ! " he would say . And the BUrgerrneister and the Landrat would glance at the massively framed clock above the platform , and one or the other of them , lowering his voice , might say that this was the way the meetings had always been held . What kind of questions had he had in mind , they might ask him in quiet , conciliatory voices , saying , as they buttoned their coats over , that once the official addresses had been delivered , it was customary for a town meeting to come to a close . And the young man , who had been brought up among community chests and co-operatives in the Middle West , would stand there saying helplessly : " But this is a forum for the people ! That 's the idea of it , " his dark , outraged eyes watching the people who had never asked questions of their administrators and who could not learn to ask them now , turn quietly and go . B UT once in the winter , when the snow was failing thick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nothing to do with the mission on which he had come . It was dusk when he set out , for he had put this off until the final moment of the day , and he walked with his overcoat collar turned up , and the limp brim of his worn , felt hat pulled down , following a narrow , cobbled street which wound up through the archaic houses , begrudging every instant- of the time that he must give . But he liked the taste of the winter evening on his lips , and the sight of the crowded , leaning dwelling places , so picturesque that it seemed to him he moved through that miniature scenery , and that facsimile of falling snow , which are contained within a paperweight glass ball . He climbed steadily , his eyes seeking the number of a house he did not know . It had been described in thetelephone directory as the " Berufsschule fur Bewegungs - A usdruck - Kunst - Rhythmik and Gesellschaftstanz " but there was no sign to confirm this when he came to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archway 's moist , grooved stone . He lifted the knocker on the heavy oak panel of the door , and let it fall , and the ring of its iron sounded in the narrow , snow-hushed street . When the door had opened just wide enough to let him pass , Rod Murray stepped into the flagstoned corridor , and he waited a moment , wondering at the identifiable sense of stealth , the silence , which dwelt within the dancing school 's interior . An oil lamp burned at the end of the long hall , and , to the left , a flight of dilapidated stairs leaned against the massive stones of the wall , its baroque bannisters hanging , like a great , warped harp , no longer fit for music , forgotten there in the obscurity . And , as the half dark cleared , he saw that a woman stood with her back against the door that she had closed behind him , and for an instant he felt the familiar stir of hope that , not Kant , or Fichte , or Hegel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national mind , the national experience , might yield some portion of the national mystery . " I 'm Mr. Murray , from Military Government , " he said , speaking his imitation German to the faceless and nameless presence of the woman in the hall . " I am the Frau Direktor of this poor little establishment , " she said hoarsely and rapidly out of the shadows to him ; and at the sound of her voice , defensive , cautious , low , he knew it would not be she who had cupped in her bare hands , and shielded through the years , the small , hot , eager flame of individual intent , keeping it clear of the collective blasphemy . " I used to have a big house in Hamburg , with three fine reception rooms , all good enough for royalty , and now it 's come to this , " she said , the whine resorted to at once , like an arm already slyly lifted in the darkness to ward off whatever threatened blow might fall . " I lost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I used to have a fine selection of pupils , girls from decent families , but since the war ended , everything 's changed . The quality 's not the same , " she said , and when she spoke again the voice was even warier . " Have ? " lIlltwmnimt  --  tt ... rt ? - ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? . ? ometMt ? ? ? ? tfP  --  m ? ? . ? ? ? ? AUFWIEDELSEHEN ABEND you come privately , or is this an official visit you 're making us ? " she said . " It 's like this , " said Rod Murray quickly , impatient with her voice , her words , her flesh . " One of our Military Government officers is leaving , and we 're giving him a party on Friday night , a sort of Aufwiedersehen Abend , " he said , inventing the German phrase for it as he went along . " I 've been asked to take care of the entertainment for the evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancers  --  girls , of course . As a professional , you 'll have to help me , " he said , and he tried to see the hour marked on the watch strapped to his wrist . " This is the first time I 've had to do anything in the line of entertainment , " he said . " Ah , girls , " said the woman , and she seemed to speak in singular relief . " Sometimes the army sends someone to investigate , so we have to ask . Will you come upstairs , Mr. Murray ? " she said , and she moved out of the dark of the door well , saving : " Ah , girls . They 're mostly FlUchtlinge or DPs now . We have n't much else to offer , " as she gathered up her hanging garments and moved swiftly past him to the stairs . He followed her up the trembling structure , having scarcely glimpsed her face yet , and , at the top , without warning , her profile was cast in outsized shadow on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman , but of a lean , lipless courtier from another century , an aging page boy , with the hair cut like a casque to fit the bony head . The silhouetted nose was the beak of a bird of prey , and was perhaps even corneous in substance , Rod Murray thought in revulsion as the outlandish figure stooped , bowed and evil , to fit a key into the lock of the closed door . " There 'll certainly be one or two to interest you , " she said , and she pushed the door open , and gestured with one horny wing for him to pass . T HE big room they entered was as cold as a cave , and it was lit by four standing lamps which flanked both sides of an upright piano , with the coats-of-arms of the leading German cities embossed in color on their parchment shades . On the piano top stood a glass vase of crepe paper roses , and when Rod Murray laid his hat down beside the vase , he saw that the rose petals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath a film of dust and age . " I know exactly what I want , " he began to say , while he sought to avoid the sight of the hostess reflected from every angle in the long , scarred mirrors which hung on two of the four moldy walls . " I thought of starting off with a Spanish or Hungarian dancer , if you had the right person and the correct music for it . Perhaps a fandango , " he said , but wherever he looked for gaiety and beauty , there was the aged woman in her hanging , fanning clothes . Her brow was covered by a smooth , oiled , ebony bang which a green silk ribbon held in place , and from under this fringe , her black eyes watched him narrowly . Two spots of rouge , as dark as bruises , stood high upon her cheekbones , a green brocaded neckcloth kept the disaster of her throat from sight , but the fleshless cardlege of her ears was visible through the dyed black tassels of her hair . " Then perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blumen sort of thing . " Rod Murray tried to go on with it as he strolled restlessly from lamp to piano , piano to mirror , mirror to lamp again , in this room which held itself in readiness for some function that he could not name . " I do n't want to undertake too much and I 'd like to know the price beforehand , " he said , not knowing yet that this was the first sentence she had understood in its entirety , and understood by instinct only , her eye turned canny as a hawk 's under the oiled ebony fringe of hair . " I 'll get the girls down , and you can make your arrangements with them , " she said . " But I get 20 per cent of every fee . That 's customary in the establishment , " she said , before she flapped from the room , and closed the door , and locked it from the landing . It was then , without any sense of shock or personal outrage , that he recognized the actual nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While he waited , Rod Murray decided on the things that he was going to say . But he did not say them , for when the woman unlocked the door again , there were three girls with her , two of them blond , and the third one dark , and all of them identically dressed in flesh-colored bathing suits , with high-heeled , worn , black slippers on their naked feet . She herded them forward , these three white glutted geese , and , as they moved toward the piano , Rod Murray could see the goose-pimples the cold had raised on their plucked bare backs and on their heavy , undressed limbs . The two blond girls halted beside one of the standing lamps , and laid their arms around each other 's waists , and faced Rod Murray , smiling , while the dark young woman sat down before the keyboard , flexed the muscles of her forearms , and began to play . As she played , the three of them chanted " Deep in the Heart of Texas " as casually as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were inherent in their birthright , and this accent from one state of America the flavor of their native speech . The hostess had taken a chair facing the piano , and , while the others sang to its accompaniment , she kept time by tapping her wooden leg , or her cloven hoof , or her broomstick , on the dusty boards . " But this is n't the kind of thing I 'm looking for ! " Rod Murray cried out , and he retrieved his hat from the piano top , where it left a ring of melted snow . " I wanted dancers ! I wanted professional entertainment ! " he said to them in his impatience before he hastened toward the door . When he turned the key in the lock and jerked the door open , the sound of the Frain Direktor 's tapping and the rippling of the music ceased , and the women were left there , motionless , speechless , hearing him shout : " Dancers ! Herr Gott , ca n't you understand German ? " before he jammed his hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs . T HAT was Thursday , and by Friday morning the snow was two feet deep in the streets of the town , and the gray tiled roofs of the Schloss and the university buildings , and the houses on the north side of the hill were crested and fish-boned with white . But although the sky was overcast , the snow had ceased to fall . Rod Murray gave no thought to the dancers as he walked to the Rathaus , where the trial of the former editor of the local newspaper was about to begin ; for he had seen in the records the articles the former Nazi editor had written in the war years and these were in his mind as he pushed into the crowded courtroom and shouldered his way forward , the only American who had taken the obligation as his own and come . The defendant , sittingside by side with his lawyer , faced the German judge 's raised seat , and the prosecutor strolled hack and forth in the space left between the court stenographers and the defendant , rubbing his red-knuckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the streets of freshly fallen snow . The defendant was a lean , distinguished , white-haired gentleman , and at times he turned in his chair to smile discreetly , under his clipped mustaches , at his wife and his three daughters , clad in black , who sat behind him . Around these women , the defendant 's friends formed a protective block , for the former editor was a most celebrated and respected man . " The defendant has stated , and maintains , that he was an anti-Nazi editor , " were the words the prosecutor now addressed to the courtroom , and Rod Murray , wearing his overcoat still , usurped a place on the fringe of the elite , two rows behind the defendant 's wife , and the chair cried out beneath his weight as he sat down . " As late as March 1945 , the defendant was still editing the newspaper in this town , " the prosecutor said , and now a murmuring became audible , a whisper of protest which seemed to spread from seat to seat , stirring even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the hall . " As a part of his defense , he has stated that his editorials were not political , but theological in nature , " the prosecutor continued . " For an example , at Easter 1945 , the defendant wrote and published an editorial on the rising of the new Messiah from the grave . " It was known that the prosecutor was not a native of the university town , that he was not a Hessian even , but that he was a Fliichtling from Rostock who had taken refuge here less than a year ago among them , and they did not like his alien accent , or the sharp , sad features of his face . " Now let us assume , " the prosecutor said , giving half of all he had to say to the grave , young judge who looked down at them from his raised chair , and half to the peopled courtroom , " that there were certain unmistakable ways in which an anti-Nazi editor conducted himself so that he should be known for what he was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conservatively but expensively accoutered figure of the white-haired editor , and the spectators , too , turned toward him , some of them half rising from their seats the better to see this distinguished man whose printed words had for so long made plausible , and continued to make plausible even in defeat , the legend of their own ascendancy . Here he sat like a common man , and yet so manifestly the gentleman , despite the circumstances which had brought him here to be humbled in their eyes . But , although his two sons were prisoners of war in Russia still , as were the sons of many in the courtroom , and although his house , as was the case with so many of their houses , was still in the hands of the Americans , they knew that his very blood forbade that he become as common or as humble as they . " The question with which we are faced is whether the defendant , at any time , or by any voluntary act , gave evidence of being an anti-Nazi editor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ louder than before . " Give us another prosecutor ! " a voice called out , but scarcely a single voice , for it seemed to come from all four corners of the hall . " We do n't need any Fliichtlinge here ! " the multiple , disembodied voice called , and the young judge cleared his throat and asked for quiet , while the court guards moved through the assemblage . " We do n't want anyone from the Eastern Zone to prosecute our townspeople ! " the voices said . The judge had got to his feet , and he glanced uncertainly across the courtroom ; but he , Like the prosecutor , was a man without legal training , except that acquired in these Occupation-sanctioned courts , and it was little comfort to him now that he had been chosen for his political integrity . He stood up , shabby , provincial-looking , in his brown suit of ersatz , wartime wool , unfitted , to the eyes which had just turned from the defendant , for this or any other role which the Occupation might authorize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now another newspaper editor ! " the prosecutor 's voice rang strongly out , and , at the sound of its authority , the uproar abruptly died . " I would like him to tell you his experiences . I am going to put him on the witness stand , " he said . " I believe he will tell you that , in his opinion , it was not possible for a man to be both an anti-Nazi and a newspaper editor as late as 1945 in Germany . " T HE witness in question stood up at once in the front row of seats , a broad , short young man with thick-lensed glasses on his nose , wearing a suit that was too tight for him . And , as he picked his way nearsightedly across the intervening people , a titter of laughter ran through the courtroom , and the people did not draw their legs aside to let the witness pass , and he took his place before them in the isolated witness chair . " I began publishing a political and literary weekly in Nuremberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , " he began his testimony . He had clasped his childishly dimpled hands across the straining buttons of his vest , and a crescent of flesh , which lay pink and fresh beneath his chin , shrunk and expanded , deflated , inflated , as if made of rubber , while he spoke . " Until 1937 , I experienced increasing trouble with the Reich authorities , " he said , his voice pitched almost ludicrously high . " I had frequently refused to print the Deutsches Nachrichten Biiro communiqu  --  s because of their distortion of the news . Early in 1937 , I was informed through the Gauleiter 's office that an impending paper shortage would necessitate the suspending of a large number of small newspapers , and that only those which served the interests of the nation , and the party , could count on sufficient newsprint to go on . In my editorials , I continued to criticize both the domestic and the foreign policy of the regime , " he went on in his absurdly pitched voice , " so that it was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed essential to me that all information concerning the restrictions on freedom of speech and action which were being imposed on the German people by the leaders of the Reich should be made known to the outside world , and so I passed weekly articles into Holland , and these were printed throughout the country , signed by my initials only , " and the rosy crescent which doubled his chin , deflated and then inflated , as he spoke . At this moment , as if roused suddenly to interest , the defendant stirred in his chair , and his flat , naked lips stiffened in a half smile of forbearance beneath his white mustache . Then he leaned a little closer to his lawyer , and dropped his lean , gentlemanly hand upon the other 's sleeve . The lawyer listened to the communication that was whispered to him , nodding his round head slowly in agreement , his prominent blue eyes fixed without expression on the ludicrous figure seated in the witness chair . " In the spring of 1940 , when the W ehrmacht overran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the author of these articles was revealed in the files of an Amsterdam newspaper , and I was arrested in Nuremberg shortly after . I was tried , and sentenced to fifteen years at hard labor , " lie said , and then he ceased to speak . " Will you give the court some of the details concerning your internment ? " the prosecutor said . " I was interned in Dachau . My windpipe was broken during the beatings I received there , " he said , his eyes myopic , undecipherable , behind the thick lenses of his spectacles , and no emotion altered his smooth , fat , fair-skinned face . " I had served nearly a third of my sentence when I was liberated by the Americans , " he said , making the statement without drama , but , once it was made , the defense lawyer arose . " If your Honor permits , " he said , the title given in derision to the judge who wore no judicial robes , " I would like to suggest that we who are gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is evident to everyone of us that this young man must have suffered the greatest privations during his confinement as a traitor to his country . Perhaps it would be in order to take up a collection for him in the courtroom today . My client has expressed himself as willing to start off such a subscription with a donation of two Deutsche Marks and fifty pfennigs to enable this needy man to buy himself a hearty meal . " The laughter appeared to begin just behind the defendant 's chair , and it was echoed here and there throughout the courtroom , until , gaining momentum , it seemed to rise from the throat of every man and woman in the ancient hall . The young judge again called out for quiet , but now that the witness had got to his feet , the spectators only laughed the louder , as if , standing there erect , with his short arms straining in the sleeves of his jacket , he was an even more humorous figure than they had recalled . " Quiet ! " the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there MAGAZINE was no sign or semblance of quiet . Instead the multiple voice which had spoken out before now gathered power and articulation , and it cried : " Heil Hitler ! " and the judge leapt up , his young hands trembling , and ordered that the court be cleared . It was only Rod Murray who moved against the refluent tide , shouldering his way , in an overcoat bought four years ago in Chicago , back toward the tables where the court stenographers gathered their papers up , and past them to the judge , and the witness , and the prosecutor , knowing that in making his way to them , he approached the flesh and the blood of men who spoke his tongue . And yet there was nothing he could find to say in shame or in anger or in any language to them , but , until the courtroom cleared , he stood there , taking his place beside them , and then they walked out into the sunless day together . On the steps of the Rathaus he turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judge 's , and the witness 's , and the prosecutor 's hands . H E ATE lunch alone at the Special Services ' Club , and , with the taste of coffee in comfort on his tongue still , he came out onto the high , bleak , wintry terrace . The terra cotta flower boxes stood empty on the balustrades , and across the valley of this foreign land of Hesse , the Schloss stood strong as a fortress on its hill . It might have been a picture that Breughel had painted , all this that lay before him , the slate blue houses of the town descending , roof by snow-traced roof , to the barren trees which bordered the dark waters of the river , with even the single crow set as trademark and signature in the leafless branches , except that the bright , myriad , scattered presence of the living , which was the speech of Breughel 's heart , had been deleted from the scene . And in a month like this one , Rod Murray thought as he leaned on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had flown with the others before dawn up this valley , by-passing the university town , and the others before it , the steel hearts of the engines throbbing northward as they crossed these hills toward Kassel , moving in formation toward what they had come out to do . It was no more than one name recalled out of many destinations , remembered now be-1.1011 ? ? 91. cause of the look of the sky and the river , and because he knew that below , at the bridge which spanned the water , a sign stated that Kassel lay no more than a hundred kilometers ahead . Kassel , he thought , hearing again the pulse of the bombers as they bore such annihilation to that one town that the dust and debris , and the broken galleries and pilasters of where it once had stood , had no more relation to the present than the hushed , volcanic twilight of Pompeii . And then , without warning , he remembered the dancers , and remembered that the farewell party would take place that evening , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrace to hail the army bus which passed below . In his office in the Military Government building , his German secretary was putting fresh varnish on her nails , so she could not look up at once when he came in . But she said that the Herr Direktor of the local theater company was plitting on a Zuckmayer play which called for a Luger automatic to be fired on the stage . As long as Germans could not be in possession of firearms , she went on saying as she painted the nail varnish carefully on , the Herr Direktor had been trying all morning to get in touch with him to find out what he should do . " That 's something for the Provost Marshal 's office , " Rod Murray said , dismissing it . " Ok ev-doke , but it seems it comes under Art Information , " said the secretary , surveying her nails . " The Provost Marshal 's office sent him down to us . " There was this to be settled , and it took four telephone calls , and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conference with the Fiihrer of " The Nature Lovers " as to which numbers of their repertoire of marching songs would be authorized , under the relaxing of controls , to be sung at future meetings in the springtime hills . It was five o'clock , it was the end of the day , when the young Fiihrer left Rod Murray 's office , and there had been no time to think of the entertainment for the evening that lay ahead . And then Rod Murray 's secretary came in to comb out her long hair at the mirror before going home , and she said that someone from the " Berufsschule fur **25;1009;TOOLONG ? hythmik and Geselleschaftstanz " had telephoned . " My God , the dancers ! The entertainers for the party tonight ! " Rod Murray cried , and he jumped up behind his desk . " Would you like me to take care of it for you ? " said his secretary , and she looked at her own face in the mirror as she combed back her hair . " I wanted Hungarian , Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray cried out . " And musicians with their music ! I wanted to make it something good ? " " I can make it good , " said his ' secretary . She had turned away from the glass on the wall , and he saw her hair , as he had seen it countless times before , combed dark and soft to her shoulders , and the lipstick laid smoothly on her mouth . " I 've been working six months for you , and you still do n't seem to understand me , " she said , her eyes on him in stubborn , cold rebuke . " The other officers I worked for here before were different . They all seemed to understand me , " she said , and she came across the room toward his desk , American nylons pulled tight and sheer upon her well-shaped legs . She picked up the short black arm of mouthpiece and receiver from the telephone , and she dialed the numbers with a forefinger on which the nail was varnished as bright as blood . The conversation took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the questions , and gave the answers , her dark , slow glance moved , without expression , over the features of his face . And when it was done , she sat , in the green plaid skirt that must have been ordered from a Sears , Roebuck catalogue page  --  by whom , or at what interval in the history of Military Government , or for what compensation , he did not know  --  and she told him what the Frau Direktor of the " Berufsschule " had said . It was only later , after he had gone down the stairs the night before , that the Frau Direktor had understood he had come there Eor dancers , professional dancers . " You need someone to take care of you over here . You have too much faith in people . I saw that right away , the minute I started working for you , " his secretary said , and she threw her head back , and shook out her long soft hair . " All right , " said Rod Murray in impatience . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that some stars of a well-known troupe of dancers had arrived from Berlin this afternoon , and she could send you some very cosmopolitan performers , if you wanted them still , " she said . She had slipped off the corner of the desk now , and she looked at him with suddenly baleful eyes . " I told her to send them to Military Government . billets at eight o'clock tonight , with costumes and musicians . " " How much did you settle for ? " Rod Murray said , as he watched her going , as if in pique , to the door . " Fifty Deutsche Marks , including the music , " said his secretary , " and the money to be paid directly to her . She 's afraid they might hold out on her percentage . " And then her voice stretched lazily into irony . " You should call on me more often . I 'm pretty good at making bargains , " she said . J r- wAs after eight by the time Rod Murray had eaten and bathed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entertainers as he came down the stairs . This requisitioned house in which he and the others were billeted was one of the finest in town , richly furnished and handsomely wainscoted and beamed , without a mark of wartime damage on it . And now the lower floor of it was decked out for the farewell party with paper vines of mauve wistaria , and hanging cardboard stars . A distant banquet table , framed by the dark wood of the wide-arched doorways which opened from room to room , could be seen laid with white linen in the farthest chamber which once had been the Nazi owner 's library . From the stairs , Rod Murray saw the shining glass goblets placed there in preparation , and the punch bowl , still empty , and the Meissen porcelain waiting , the monogrammed silver laid spoon within gleaming spoon , fork curved to fork , beneath the oscillating shadows of the hanging stars . From the kitchen alone , where the servants prepared the buffet supper , came the sound of the living ; for the Senior Military Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legal and University Officers , were dressing in their bedrooms still , and the guests had not yet arrived . Only when he had reached the last step of the stars did Rod Murray see there were two people sitting side by side on the carved bench in the entrance hall . He took them at first for children , so slight , so submissive theyseemed as they sat there under the massive , mounted stag heads : a pale-haired boy in an opera cloak , with the velvet collar fastened beneath his pointed chin , and a girl in a long , dark , shabby Coat drawn close beside him , her body curved as if in weariness , and a muff of black and white rabbit fur upon her knees . The muff was large enough for a deep-breasted diva to have carried in triumph , and the girl kept her hands inside it , and a.hunch of shriveled , faded violets made of cloth was pinned to its molting hide . They were abandoned children , Rod Murray thought , who had put on these adult clothes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in any spirit of carnival , for their faces , which were turned toward him , were strangely austere . But once they had got to their feet , and stood before him on the delicately tinted Persian rug , he saw they were doubtless his own age , perhaps in their middle twenties , but so frail that he believed he could have lifted them , one in each arm , with ease , and carried them across the hall like dolls . " The Frau . Direktor of the Terufsschule ' , " the young man began saying in German in a low voice to Rod Murray . 64 ES , yes , " Rod Murray said quickly . He took his cigarettes out , and he passed them first to the girl , the stirring of hope . quickening in him again , believing it might be from their mouths that he would learn how it had taken place , and how it had seemed to them when they were children , and how much had been explained away so that the human ear could bear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and her head reached barely to his shoulder , and her hair was wrenched up from her small , swollen brow , and combed into a pompadour , with the long , faded , golden ends of it pinned high upon her skull . Her fingers came , as sharp as a bird 's claws , from the rabbit muff , and she did not speak , she did not smile , but her hand , with the cigarette in the fingers of it , withdrew inside the muff again . Her narrow lips were not so much as touched with red , but her dark eyes were outlined and lashed so lavishly and carelessly with mascara in her white , pointed face , that Rod Murray had the illusion that he viewed them through a magnifying glass . " Yes , of course , I was expecting you , " he said , and he passed the cigarettes to the young man , whose bony hand tossed one wing of the opera cloak aside and sought to unhook the worn , velvet collar at his throat , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fright parching his tongue , might fumble desperately for breath . " Perhaps the Frau Direktor told you that my wife and I come from the Eastern Sector of Berlin ? " he said , and he bowed his head to light his cigarette from the lighter Rod Murray held . " The food situation is pretty grim there , is n't it ? " said Rod Murray , but the young man did not answer , for it was not the role of Fliichtlinge which they were here to play . " We 've just had a most successful night club season there , " he said , and now , with a cigarette between his fingers , his tongue seemed eased , and he drew the good , sustaining draughts of the tobacco in . " We have our costumes with us , " the girl said , speaking scarcely aloud , and , with her hand inside the molting muff still , she gestured behind them toward the bench . And there , in the shadows against the paneled wall , Rod . Murray saw the trade mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sit beneath the bridges , waiting for nothing but a destination  --  the split , bulging shape of a suitcase , its material varnished to emulate leather , its bulk supported by various lengths and weights of string . " We like to travel , " the girl said , with these words refusing their part in that dogged exodus of women and men who cross illicitly from one zone to the other for the sake of food , or for the opulent look of counters and store windows , or else for the indescribable quality of freedom , either breathed or spoken , the stragglers coming at the rate of a thousand a month , or a thousand a fortnight , or even a hundred a day . " The Frau Direktor of the Terufsschule ' is my wife 's aunt . That 's how we happened to stop off in Hesse , " the young man said , and , as he smoked the cigarette , he smiled at the thought of this part of the country 's rural ignorance , its archaic monuments , its bigotry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although there 's not much of interest for us here , " he said , and he added : " My wife 's aunt is Jewish . My wife and I are neither Jews nor refugees . " " We 're planning a foreign tour  --  France , England , and then America , " the girl said . " Look , " said Rod Murray , speaking quickly as he glanced at the time upon his wrist ; " be- , fore you people begin dancing , maybe you 'd like something to eat  --  some sandwiches and coffee ? If you would n't mind coming into the kitchen , " he began , but they must have sensed the weakness , the perturbation in him , for their eyes were on him in slow , cold calculation , examining this which he had just " proposed . " So you 're going to pay us in food an'a cigarettes , then ? " the young man said . The three of them stood motionless in the hallway , as hushed as if in the deep heart of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads . " That was n't the arrangement , " the girl said , her thin lips scarcely seeming to move . " But of course not . Of course you 'll get paid the Deutesche Marks too , " Rod Murray said , and he turned to lead them toward the kitchen . " And you 'll pay it to us ? " the young man said , not moving . " You wo n't pay it to the ; ' Frau Direktor ? " he said . They were almost at the threshold of the kitchen , with the fragrance of fresh coffee coming richly on the air , when the young man remembered the cardboard suitcase , and he walked swiftly back in his cracked patent leather dancing pumps to pick it up and bear it with tuirn before anyone should carry it away . T HE next to come were the musicians . There were three of them : one with a shining bald plate , and a leather music portfolio in his hand , and two studious-looking young men , one carrying a violin in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all three members of the local symphony orchestra , the violinist told Rod Murray , giving his classical right profile to the conversation , with his eyes fixed straight ahead , like the set gaze of the blind . But he was not blind , for he laid his violin case down on the bench , and he took off his overcoat , as the others did , and then the three of them strung their identical white silk scarves through the sleeves of their overcoats , and hung them in the cloakroom , and then they raised their open palms , and even the bald-pated musician made the gesture of smoothing back his hair . When this was done , they followed Rod Murray across the polished bare floor of the first reception room , where the grand piano stood , the violinist carrying his violin in its case , and the accordionist his accordion on its plaited leather strap , and the pianist the music portfolio . But it was only the violinist , keeping one half of his face averted still , who looked up and smiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardboard stars . " It will be spring soon , " the violinist said , speaking his carefully enunciated English to Rod Murray , and there was a sound of happiness in his voice , as if he had recognized in these tokens that a long , cold season was about to change . He and the accordionist were students at the university , he said ; they were medical students , and he still turned his head from Rod Murray as he lifted his instrument from its case . It would begin to be more pleasant now , walking up the paths to the lecture halls , he went on saying , and he asked Rod Murray how well he knew the town , and the Schloss , and the short cuts leading through the trees . " There is a quite lonely statue of Schiller . It stands among the lilacs halfway up , " he said , and he dropped his head , in seeming solicitude , upon the violin 's vibrant wood . The bald-pated man had sat down in his ancient dinner suit on the concave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , immediately spun the seat on its swivel , and seated himself again , his short legs reaching for the pedals , his blunt fingers stroking the keys . The accordionist lifted his accordion , ornate in ivory and gold , and cradled it in love in his arms for a moment while he peered across the pianist 's shoulder at the open score . " The dancers are changing into their costumes , " Rod Murray said , and now , as the violinist tuned his strings , he saw for the first time , and with an almost convulsive sense of shock , the left side of the violinist 's face . The head was a rather noble head , constructed of long , solid bones , and crowned with a mane of lightish , lively hair . But the face he saw now was the face of a broken statue , for a scar ran hideously from the lobe of the left ear , slashed into the shattered temple , and crossed the forehead , a welt that served to seam the cavity where the hinge of MAGAZINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheekbone were no longer , and mounted to stitch the empty temple closed . " They 're going to do a tango , a rhumba , and a Viennese waltz , " Rod Murray said , with his heart gone sick within him . " Let 's go out and have a drink before they start , " he said . And so it became the violinist 's turn to follow , as had the dancers before him , into the kitchen , and there , in his abomination of this face , Rod Murray filled the two tall glasses with Rhine wine . " So you 're medical students ? " Rod Murray said , keeping his eyes away . " Prosit , " the violinist said before he drank , and he went on saying : " We will be doctors . We will cure humanity , " saying it partly in humor to the American . " I know a strange story about doctors , about surgeons , " he said , speaking a little shyly of this thing he knew . " In the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great things with plastic surgery . They could make a man 's face new again . They could make it look like something it had not been before . My father was a surgeon , an army surgeon , and he did this , " the violinist said , and Rod Murray stood listening to what he said , his eyes fixed on the label on the slender bottle . " But after a time , he found out that a man 's face does not stay the way that surgery makes it . After six months , eight months , a man 's face will change back again to what he is like himself , inside . If you are a poet , " said the violinist as he lifted his glass of wine , " then an army surgeon , a good army surgeon has his duty to perform , and when he operates he must give you a warrior 's face . My father did this . But in six months , eight months , the face he has made becomes a poet 's face again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he felt this knowledge chilling his blood . " No , it is the truth , " said the violinist , and he put down his glass so that Rod Murray could fill it with white wine again . " If you do not believe this is true , then there is nothing left to believe , " he said . " My face , " he said abruptly . " They left it the way it is because by that time they had learned . They knew they could make it look the way they wanted , and then in six months , eight months , it would betray them again . It would look like a musician 's face , or a poet 's face . It would have the old mark of loneli-ness on it , and this they could not have , " he said . Their glasses stood empty on the kitchen table when they walked back into the reception room together , and the violinist smiled , as if at some secret which he alone possessed , as he moved the floor lamp a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it so that the light fell on the tilted rack where the open book of music stood . Above them could be heard the slamming of bedroom doors on the upper floors , and then the good-natured chaffing of the other Military Government officers as they came down the wainscoted stairs . And then the bell at the entrance door rang loudly , and the first guests were ushered into the hallway , the American women in long , half-formal gowns , and the men in army uniform or in fancy jackets from the Clothing Store , coming in with a clamor of greeting from the wintry night . Once their ' wraps had been laid aside , the guests moved on , escorted by the Public Safety Officer , or the Criminal Investigation Agent , or the Legal or University Officers , to the farthest room where the platters were laid with heart-shaped sandwiches , and the punch bowl stood filled now to the brim . T HE musicians had begun playing " Don Giovanni " to set the romantic tempo of the evening , but once the dancers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano , the accordion , and the violin took their cue , and they broke into the triumphant bars of " Toreador . " And now that the dancers danced , Rod Murray could scarcely bring himself to look in their direction , for they were far too thin to be making this spectacle of themselves in any public place . It seemed to him that the threads of their necks must snap in two , unable to bear the weight of the fleshless skulls they carried , and that their bones would pierce the carnival lace and tinsel of their disguise , and expose them for the skeletons they were . He could hear the girl 's hand striking the tambourine with which she danced , and he could not bring himself to turn his head and see again the bony stalks of her white arms lifted , like the arms of those who have already perished reaching from thegrave . And the young man , in his matador 's suit and his cracked black patent leather pumps , danced his desperate , intricate steps before her , his legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton stockings , the brass coins jingling with avarice on his tricorn hat . And no one else looked at them , it seemed to Rod Murray ; no one else dared to watch them as they danced away across the parquet floor . In the farthest room , the Senior Military Government Officer was urging the guests to drink , and the waiters passed with trays among them , and the men 's and women 's talk and laughter sounded far , anonymous , without human meaning , under the festoons of Japanese wistaria , and the trembling pasteboard stars . And then the Spanish number was done , and the dancers were gone , and the faint clapping of hands expired through the rooms , Rod Murray had asked that drinks be brought for the musicians , and he himself drank a goblet of punch quickly down . " Let 's give them a dance number now , so the guests can dance while the dancers change their costumes , " Rod Murray said , and he stayed near to the musicians , not wanting to meet the Senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were you on ? " he suddenly said , and he stood looking boldly at the violinist 's face . " Oh , nowhere . I was n't on any front , " the violinist said , and he dropped his head , as if in apology , upon the violin 's wood . " I lived in a town farther up toward the north , a place called Kassel . I did n't have time to get to an air-raid shelter . I was home on furlough . ' That 's all there is to it , " he said . " Kassel , " Rod Murray repeated . He set the cut-glass goblet down on the top of the grand piano , and he stood there , stunned for a moment , at the sound of the town 's name . " Kassel . My God , " he said . " You were in Kassel . " Before they began to play , he picked up the goblet again , and he finished drinking the punch that was in it . And it seemed to him then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were to go away and leave them together for a little while , something quite simple and quite comprehensible might still be said .
