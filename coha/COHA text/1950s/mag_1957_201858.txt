Six thousand feet up in the Swiss Alps , in St. Moritz ' Palace Hotel , 1,000 guests washed down a dinner of caviar and filet mignon with vintage champagne , then danced the night away until 7 in the morning . Among the merrymakers were Shipping Tycoon Stavros Niarchos , Cinemastars Linda Christian and Hildegarde Neff , Liechtenstein 's Prince Constantine , Irish Beer Heir Loel Guinness . As the evening glowed to a climax , roly-poly Winston Churchill II , 16-year-old grandson of Sir Winston , leaped on a table , grabbed a cane , gaily began popping the balloons . <P> Last week , at the height of the season , 6,500 well-heeled guests crammed every room in St. Moritz ' 47 hotels . They schussed down the powdery slopes overlooking the little valley , tried the Olympia Ski Jump , which drops a perilous 200 ft. , hurtled 1,346 yds. down the ice-banked Cresta Run , one of the world 's first artificial toboggan slides ( built 1884 ) at better than a mile a minute . Evenings , the women doffed ski suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tails to mambo through the night . Others simply spent their time quietly breathing-for St. Moritz ' crystal-clear air has 18% less oxygen than sea-level air , forces visitors to breathe deeper and faster , bringing color to pallid cheeks . <P> Bronze Age Lumbago . A resort town ever since Bronze Age lumbago sufferers took its waters 3,000 years ago , St. Moritz ' modern beginnings date back just a century ago to the day in 1856 when Innkeeper Johannes Badrutt bought the little Kulm Hotel . Johannes was modestly prospering on summer trade when one autumn he wagered four departing British guests that they could stroll around St. Moritz in midwinter without overcoats . That winter the four struggled upland through the snow , arrived in St. Moritz to find the sun so warm that Johannes was waiting in his shirtsleeves . He won his bet . Next winter the four came back with friends , and the town was on its way to fame as a winter resort . Johannes enlarged the Kulm to accommodate 400 guests , furnished it with fine paintings and sculptures , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Johannes died , son Caspar bought the nearby Palace , later turned it over to his 22-year-old son Hans , who furnished it with Gobelin tapestries , the finest crystals , magnificent antiques . In the palmy days before and after World War I the Palace became a kind of winter home for the very rich and the very royal . The Maharaja of Hyderabad would arrive with 500 trunks and a personal cook , who sprinkled gold dust on the rice before serving his master 's curry . On arriving , the Aga Khan would give Head Porter Chasper $10,000 to be handed out when the Aga Khan needed pocket money ; the hotel would provide the Aga Khan ( an Ismaili Moslem ) with a compass , so he could determine the proper direction to face while praying . Once King Albert I of the Belgians , a hotel guest , greeted Host Badrutt : " You are King of St. Moritz . I am King of the Belgians . I greet you as a colleague . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
