Over the country , however , regardless of lower interest rates and stepped-up promotional drives of some lenders , reports indicate that home buyers are not swarming into real estate offices . And builders , except in a few localities , are hanging back on large-scale speculative des elopments for which buyers will have to be found after the houses are up .

So far , the F H.A . speed-up has been more pronounced in applications involving sale of older houses than on deals for newly-built homes . In the Newark , N.J. , area , for example , in five weeks through February 7 , new house applications rose to 217 from 184 in the comparable 1956 period , while those on existing houses jumped to 728 from 384 .

Lenders Can Free Funds By selling to F.N.M A , lenders can free their funds for further investment in new home loans .
