THE soldier often feels a strange disappointment when he sees his first battlefield . A barn still stands with cattle waiting to be fed ; a tree is green and straight against the sky ; hollyhocks are in bloom . Later he realizes what has happened to the people . <P> It was like that last week when reporters first visited the village on Yucca Flat built to test the effect of an atomic blast . The reporters , who had waited 13 days for the explosion and another day to see what had happened , were primed to be shocked . They had seen the fireball dwarf the tiny village on the desert ( three houses can be seen in the lower right corner of the picture above ) , watched a train of dust follow the shock wave across the desert , felt its punch eight miles away . <P> But when they arrived at the village , they first noticed what had survived . A reinforced cinder-block house and another made of precast concrete slabs still stood , less than a mile from the blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15,4000-gal. tank of liquefied petroleum gas was intact ; only its handrail was bent . Shelves of groceries seemed unharmed . A power substation was 95% operable . The telephone system showed little damage . The blast had blown out fires that had been started by the searing heat of the explosion . Underground gas lines to houses less than a mile from ground zero were undamaged . And the Atomic Energy Commission could report : " Out of the ten houses included in the test , the condition of seven was such that they could be made habitable for emergency occupancy by shoring and repairs . " Most radios in the houses ran , and not a TV picture tube was found broken . <P> But then reporters realized that if real people instead of mannequins had inhabited the village , only a few would have survived . Inside the standing houses , Venetian blinds had been tossed around like bundles of spears , furniture hurled in grotesque stacks , cloth torn and seared . A refrig erator had exploded from the change in air pressure . Two of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn from a door and cast half through a wall , so that there was a doorknob where there was no door . Each of two typical American houses , one brick , one wood , was a pile of rubble and jackstraws . A mannequin still sat at a kitchen table in another house , but her wig had been stripped off ; it was found in the remains of the refriger ator ; another dummy was skewered with jagged glass . Cars were smashed as if a monster fist had crashed down on the roof ; one hood had flown up and stood gaping open with a frozen look of surprise . <P> Harold L. Goodwin , test operations director of the Federal Civil Defense Administration , said that anyone within one mile of the blast would have been killed by radiation or flying debris . A few people in deep bomb shelters might have survived , but even two miles from the blast injuries would have been serious and few would have escaped . <P> And the device at Yucca Flat was a small one . An H-bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
