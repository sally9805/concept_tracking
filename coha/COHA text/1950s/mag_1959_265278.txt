Dwight Eisenhower and Harold Macmillan met at Aspen Cottage 's hearthside with a common goal : to maintain peace even while preserving freedom . But they differed significantly in their ideas about the best road to travel toward that goal . <P> <P> To the British , the American position on specific problems often seemed , in latter-day diplomatic parlance , to be " rigid . " To the U.S. , the British view sometimes seemed best symbolized by an umbrella and bent toward dangerous compromise . Areas of discussion : <P> German Reunification . Longstanding U.S. view : " immediate free elections " are a prerequisite to German reunification , a position that John Foster Dulles seemed to modify in a press conference when he said that there were other ways of arriving at reunification . Macmillan view : since Khrushchev will never agree to " immediate free elections , " there is no sense in talking about them in connection with Berlin , as the U.S. insists . British spokesmen last week said that Macmillan had persuaded West Germany 's Konrad Adenauer that reunification should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome of the Eisenhower-Macmillan talks : the U.S. may not insist on " immediate free elections , " even while requiring some sort of yet-to-be-defined " free expression " by all the Germans as to their political future . The U.S. may even retreat from its position that a settlement on Berlin requires concurrent settlement of reunification-but this does not mean an abandonment of the reunification principle . <P> Control of Berlin . Longstanding U.S. view : the West has unimpeachable legal rights and moral responsibilities in West Berlin , which stands as an oasis of freedom in the desert of Communism . Macmillan view : some kind of undefined " internationalization , " e.g. , a bringing in of control representatives from neutral nations or a U.N . commission , may be possible . The U.S. still argues that any change in the status of West Berlin must be accompanied , at the minimum , by a similar change for East Berlin . <P> Recognition of East Germany . Strongly held U.S. view : no diplomatic recognition ; the British do not object to giving East Germany control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in guaranteeing the right of access . <P> Atom-Test Suspension . The U.S. view : either disarmament or test suspension , actually parts of the whole , must be accompanied by foolproof inspection controls . The Macmillan view : much the same in principle-but the British are willing to take greater risks in deciding what constitutes foolproof controls . Says a British spokesman : " The Russians do n't like foreigners swarming around their country . We do n't think they should be allowed to have a veto over inspection , but we think some arrangement can be made so there is no swarming in of foreigners . " Even in its unilateral decision to halt atom tests for a year beginning last October , the U.S. has leaned far-perilously far , think military experts-from its earlier , long-held position .
