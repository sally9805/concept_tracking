F arnsworth Foster Bryant , III , was a young man who , if not exactly smug , was at least extremely self-satisfied ? and on the face of it he had every right to be . He himself would have said that his present contented status was simply a result of organization , since he liked to think that all his life he had organized matters toward achievement of the things he really enjoyed ; but the fact that his father had been a millionaire had certainly in no way impeded the process . Although Foster 's  --  he was always called Foster  --  position as chief of the European offices of the Atlantic Broadcasting Company provided him with a more than adequate income , it is doubtful that he could have maintained the establishment he did in Paris had there not also been a comfortable supply of dividend checks and coupons . It may sound odd to describe the home of a still-youthful bachelor as an establishment , but certainly no other word could properly be applied to Foster 's apartment on the choice southern side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French would say , twelve rooms and terrace , three baths and three servants ' rooms . An inventory would have revealed that among other things there were five crystal chandeliers , none of them except the one in the library , which was First Empire , dating from later than the middle of the eighteenth century . On the living-room floor there was an Aubusson rug that had been made for the Marquise de Pompadour , and on the living-room walls there was a small but perfect collection of pictures that ranged from a noble Hubert Robert to a recently acquired Pissarro . The whole thing can perhaps he summed up best by mentioning that on one wall of Foster 's bathroom , set in an illuminated niche , was a splendid T'ang dynasty bronze wine vessel . However , to let the matter go at that would be to neglect Francoise and Andre , and they were perhaps the chief glories in Foster 's collection of objects which contribute to the pleasant life . Francoise was Andre 's wife , butfar more important than this , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered herbs in the fields of her father 's farm and put them together in some occult fashion with a handful of eggs to form an omelet so crustily golden to the eye and so meltingly tender to the palate that it lingered in memory for days . At her present age , which was indeterminate , she could , seemingly on no notice at all , turn out a variety of splendors that had made Foster 's little dinner parties famous throughout Paris . Andre , the butler , was a city type , and while one might have had reservations about Foster , since he was , after all , a pleasant , thoughtful and courteous young man , there could be none about Andre . He was a consummate snob . He was also a perfect servant . It is odd how often these characteristics go together . Any such household is obviously governed by rules on the conduct of day-to-day events , but in Foster 's , in addition to such rules , there existed a set of what might be termed immutable laws , and foremost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account short of earthquake or general war was monsieur to be disturbed on a Sunday evening . This was the period which Foster set aside to " rest and refresh himself " ? as he put it . And , as he had organized everything else , he had organized this . At precisely six o'clock Andre would arrive on the terrace bearing a silver tray containing the necessities for a very dry martini . He would prepare one , set it on a table at Foster 's side , and silently depart , leaving the tray . At approximately the same time Francoise would be laying out supper on a folding table which was always set up in the library on Sunday evenings . The menu for this was as unchangeable as the Sunday-evening law itself  --  a small , plump chicken , a green salad , a ripe Camembert , and a small howl of fruit . On a stand beside the folding table there was a half bottle of Montrachet in a silver bucket of ice . These preparations completed , Andre and Francoise would depart , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Foster would be truly . blissfully , alone . And so he was one splendid Sunday in early May when the chestnut trees along the Avenue Foch were at their glorious height and the evening sun , lingering affectionately on the terrace , had caused him to dawdle rather longer than usual over his tsecond martini . He was understandably irritated when he heard , loudly and clearly from the library , the imperious call of the telephone . He made a mental note to remind Andre in the morning that the library doors were supposed to be closed so that he could n't hear the blasted thing . After a time , of course , it stopped , and with a sigh of relief Foster put aside his book and went in to supper . He had no more than carved the chicken when it began again and this time it was right at his elbow . He put down his fork and stared at the instrument thoughtfully . The noise was intolerable , but he determined to ignore it , and with a distinct feeling of martyrdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet . It did no good , however . He was just about to dip his spoon into a bowl of the first raspberries of the season when the insistent call rang out again . This time he knew he must give up . It was a question of answering or going mad . He could retreat to his bedroom and shut all the doors , but he had no intention of being driven into hiding in his own house . Irritably he reached out and picked up the receiver . " Kleber 3.5 -- 20 ? " an operator 's voice queried . " Yes , " Foster snapped . " I have a ship-to-shore call from the Queen Elizabeth for Mr. Foster Bryant . Is he there ? " In the space of a second a hundred speculations as to the identity of his caller flashed through Foster 's mind , but he was able to pm them all aside , because he knew beyond .1 shadow of a doubt who it would he . Only one person would have waited until she was on the high seas to let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bryant , " he said wearily . " Put the call through . " Then he hung up and waited The connection was atrocious , but thai did n't matter . ( Continued on Page 97 ) The Charms of Monique ( Continued from Page 34 ) Five hundred miles of Atlantic Ocean was an inconsiderable barrier to Alicia Bryant . To use an expression he had been forced into in the Air Corps , Foster could hear his mother live-by-five . " Is that you , Buzz ? " That name again , thought Foster furiously.When would she realize that he was not in knee pants any longer ? " Yes , mother , " he said as politely as possible . " What on earth are you doing on the Queen Elizabeth ? " " What do you think I 'm doing . you idiot ? I 'm coming to Paris . Are my rooms ready ? " " Of course they are . You know perfectly well that they always are . " " Good . We get in tomorrow , but there 's no need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ticket on the boat train . And do n't come to Saint Lazare . I 'll see you at the apartment . " " Do n't be silly , " Foster shouted ; " of course I 'll come . " " Do n't , " Alicia responded firmly ; " I do n't want you . I 'll tell you why when I see you . But be at the apartment when 1 arrive . I want to talk to you . And see that there 's some mimosa in my sitting room . Good-by , darling . " " Good-by , Alicia , " Foster said , quite uselessly , because the telephone on the Queen-Elizabeth had already been hung up and Alicia was on her way back to the Veranda Grill . For some moments her son sat in his library with his hands folded in his lap , staring glumly at the bowl of raspberries , which seemed to have lost a good deal of their earlier appeal . It was not that Foster regretted the arrangement whereby there were always two rooms held at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , after all , she had put up the cash which enabled him to buy the apartment without dipping into capital , on the simple provision that until the loan was repaid there should be available to her when she chose to come to Paris a sitting room , bedroom and bath . In the seven years Foster had had the apartment she had been in Paris exactly three times , and then never for longer than a week , so it can hardly be said that she had driven a hard bargain . Foster 's only regrets were that he never knew what might happen during his mother 's visits . Thinking of his appointment book , he sighed . He was quite sure that after he had seen Alicia tomorrow there would be a good many things to be changed . Then , reflecting that the evening was shot in any case , he wandered off to make sure that his boast that the rooms were always ready was true . There had to be special soap and cologne in the bathroom , for one thing . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the season for mimosa had been over for a month ? Not being a fool , Foster made no attempt to disobey his mother 's orders about meeting her , but he did spend a good part of Monday wondering why she had so emphatically forbidden him to come . It was n't like Alicia . Normally shewould have wanted not only her son but a large car , chauffeur , and porter standing ready . However , thought Foster , Ours nut to reason why ; and he contented himself with checking on the hour of arrival of the boat train , learning to his considerable relief that it did n't get in until six in the evening . There was thus plenty of time for him to get home from the office well before she could possibly arrive . At the household conference he had called in the morning to give instructions on what must be done , Andre 's eyebrows had gone up noticeably at the mention of mimosa , but Foster was delighted to see that he had actually found some . It was splendidly arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat , improbably , in the dead center of Alicia 's sitting room . The French have a peculiar penchant for placing small , round tables in locations where , at best , they serve no purpose and , at worst , can provoke catastrophe . ) Cheerfully he broke off a spray of the fragile yellow flowers and put it in his buttonhole , thinking that it would provide a splendid opening gambit for telling Alicia something of the difficulties of finding mimosa in May . His mother was in splendid form . It seemed to Foster that she looked younger , lovelier , and more full of energy than ever . Tall and straight , impeccably tailored in pale blue tweed , with her silvery , upswept hair set off by the simplest of hats , she carried with her an air of freshness and vitality which made her son reflect ruefully that she seemed far more at home in the twentieth century than he , though he well knew that she had been astride her first pony in Texas on the day the century dawned . She held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greetings , especially of one 's relatives  --  and said affectionately , " Buzz , darling , you 're looking wonderful . Handsomer than ever  --  and not a single gray hair at thirty-five . Marvelous . " She glanced round the entrance hall and into the beautiful living room . " All this must agree with you , though heaven knows I ca n't sec why . But then , I 'm no judge . I do n't understand Boston yet , and I 've been living there the better part of forty years . " " You 're looking splendid yourself , Alicia , " Foster said gravely . " You must have had a good trip . " " Delightful , absolutely delightful . Charming people everywhere . But where is my darling Francoise ? I 've brought a whole suitcaseful of things for her . Scads of nylons and some wonderful gadgets . A mixer and an electric frying pan . " " We have a mixer , mother , " Foster said , " and I doubt sincerely that Francoise would ever look at an electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall see about that . " She plucked at the sprig of mimosa in his lapel . " I see you found the mimosa . Impossible , of course , in May , but 1 knew you would . " So much for the opening gambit . Foster sighed . " I 've asked Francoise to fixdinner , since I did n't think you would want to go out tonight . " " Perfect . Exactly what I wanted . I have a million things to talk with you about . I 'll run and take off my hat and be back in it minute . Mix me a martini  --  and mix it yourself ; do n't ask that odious man to do it . " Foster stiffened , " Andre makes wonderful martinis , Alicia. " - " I was n't questioning his martinis , " Alicia responded firmly ; " I simply said he was an odious man . Mix it yourself . " Obediently Foster went over to the Louis XV sideboard that served as a bar , reflecting grimly that though he might have lost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose the one on the subject of Buzz . He was staring into the fireplace wondering how he could bring the conversation around to the subject when Alicia returned , and her very first remark drove the matter completely out of his mind . Seating herself comfortably in his favorite chair and smiling at him over the rim of her glass , Alicia said cheerfully , " Well now , darling , what about our dinner party ? " Foster knew his mother far too well to betray himself completely , but something of his astonishment must have registered since , without waiting for a reply , Alicia went on innocently , " Well , you were planning on having a dinner for me , were n't you ? " " Why , yes , I suppose so  --  that is , of course I was , but - " " There , " Alicia said cheerfully , " I knew you would , so I took the liberty of inviting two perfectly delightful people from the ship for Saturday evening . I thought that would be a good day for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be sure of getting some really interesting people . l particularly want to get some attractive and eligible males for Monique . " Foster knew when he was beaten . He sat down quietly . " And who is Monique ? " he inquired politely . " Monique ? Oh  --  Monique de St. Come . A French girl I met on the ship . Absolutely delightful . Not only chic and lovely but tremendously intelligent . She 's been teaching French literature at Bryn Mawr for the past year and has a book coming out here soon on some French poet or other . You 'll adore her , 1 know . " Foster nodded . He thought he was beginning to see the light . " Are you matchmaking again ? " he asked bluntly . Alicia laughed . " For you ? Heavens , no  --  I gave that up long ago . But I did think I might dabble in it a bit for Moniquc . The girl is really too charming to go to waste on teaching . That 's why I hoped you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out of it a bit . Preferably the outdoor type . You know ? " She waved a hand in a gesture that took in everything from skiers to skin divers . " Well , we 'll see if we ca n't scare up something . Am I supposed to warn the victim or just let him walk into the trap unprepared ? " " Oh , really , Buzz . " Ah . thought Foster , this was it . She wanted him to do something for her and he would do it , evert at the risk of exposing his friends to heaven knew what ; but she would have to pay for it . He leaned forward in his chair , and said firmly , " Alicia , this is a matter which I have meant to discuss with you many times before , and this seems to be the opportunity . I must insist that you stop calling me Buzz . It was ail very well when I was a child , but f am now a man of thirty-five in a responsible position and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reply , " You 're also something of a pompous ass , " but she restrained herself and simply said with assumed meekness , " You can hardly expect me to call you Farnsworth , can you ? " " My friends call me Foster . " " Well , that 's a step in the right direction , though hardly a very long one . " She held out an empty glass in a mute gesture of command , and while his back was to her , a mischievous smile passed across her lips . " I 'll make a bargain with you though . I 'll stop calling you Buzz , if you stop calling me Alicia . " Foster turned to her in surprise . " But why on earth ? It 's your name , is n't it ? " " Completely aside from the fact that your brother Greg usually calls me mother , Alicia is not and never has been my name . That was the doing of your father 's family  --  just as Farnsworth Foster was . " She could n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I 'm sure most of them did n't know quite where it was , but just plain Alice was too much  --  she had to go . 1 became Alicia even before our engagement was announced . And believe me , I 've never lived it down in Texas . " Foster handed her the martini and smiled down at her . " All right , " he said , " it 's a bargain . You call me Foster and I 'll call you Alice. - Then , in a gesture that surprised even himself . he bent over and kissed her lightly on the cheek and almost whispered , " I might even get around to calling you mother . " In the course of the days that followed , Foster learned once again that one never knew what might happen during Alice 's visits . For one thing , his secretary was not faced with canceling a single appointment , because he almost never saw his mother . She seemed to be far too busy with other things to give much thought to her son , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her firm tread down the hall , quite late in the evening , it can 98 scarcely be said to have been Alice 's fault . Foster was lying awake , listening . He did manage , though , to clear up two points that had been troubling him . The first was the reason for Alice 's insistence that he should not come to meet her , and the second was the identity of the other unknown person who was going to appear for dinner on Saturday . Having acquired the answers to both these questions , Foster felt that he was now in pos. smion of all the information he could hope to obtain . He knew from experience that there was no point in trying to exact too much from Alice at one time . She had not wanted him to come to Saint Lazare simply because she had decided he was not to meet her new friends until they arrived at his apartment " I thought it would be more fun that way , " she said . " Sort of a surprise for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise and went on to inquire about Monique 's companion . " Oh , he 's not Monique 's escort , " Alice had said , as if amazed that he could be so stupid . " Good heavens , no . That 's why I wanted your young friends . Charles is for me . " Aware that his mouth was unaccountably open , Foster pretended that this was so he could murmur , " Charles ? " " Yes . Charles Pennyworth . A charming man . I met him at a dance in Houston the year before you were born , but I had n't seen him in ages until we bumped into each other on the ship . Pennyworth ! Ha ! He owns half of Texas . " And that had been almost the total extent of their conversation until the guests began to arrive on Saturday evening . Alice 's standards on the subject of what constituted an eligible young man for Monique had been extremely rigid , with the result that Foster had been able to provide only two who measured up . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these were too eligible by far , and wished them firmly back on the other side of the ocean . It must be admitted that for any young man who enjoyed surrounding himself with beautiful things , the vision of Monique was fairly breathtaking . She would have made a notable addition to any collection . Not perhaps to Rubens ' taste , but Renoir would have loved her . All of his colors were there  --  the coppery glint of her hair , the dusty-blue of the eyes and the not-too-pink little-girl 's mouth  --  and they were set in a frame of a completely simple , completely perfect , pale blue chiffon which any couturier in his right mind would have offered to her on bended knee just for the advertising . Foster cast a look of bitter reproach at his mother and managed to mutter , unheard by the others , " Chic , lovely and intelligent ! You idiot  --  she 's the most beautiful creature I 've ever seen . " " Oh , do you think so ? " Alice said brightly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , " and went off to be sure that Monique was properly introduced to Randy Burton ; an action which contributed nothing whatever to her son 's peace of mind . It had all been organized so perfectly  --  much , much too perfectly . Randy Burton 's partner was Foster 's secretary , and she had had to be dragooned into putting in an appearance , since it was well known to everyone that she was madly in love with an Italian count . As for Chuck Bentley , he was escorting his sister , and this had seemed safe enough even to Alice , The field had been left very clear for Monique . Unfortunately , it had also been left very clear for both Randy Burton and Chuck Bentley . And then , to his horror , Foster discovered that he had yet another foe . On first being introduced to Mr. Penny%vorth , he had instinctively liked him and was delighted that his mother had found such a charming companion . Seeing him now , in animated conversation with Monique in a virtually unassailable corner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the point of committing an act he would normally have considered an unforgivable breach of manners , when Andre announced that dinner was served and he realized that he was saved . By grace of the gods Protocol and Etiquette , Monique was seated on Foster 's right  --  and for the first time in his life he wished that there might have been twenty at dinner . Eighteen other guests around the table would have almost insured his having Monique to himself . But even with only six he would be in a position to put up a good fight . He found his jaw setting in a manner unknown to him since he had climbed out of his last P-5 I . Dinner , however , did not start off on the most felicitous of notes . Having disposed of the seating with little more ado than was required by common courtesy , Foster took his own place and turned what he considered to be his brightest smile toward Monique . To his surprise he found her regarding him gravely , a questioning look in her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said involuntarily . " You look so puzzled . " She nodded slightly . " I am . I have been ever since Alice introduced us . You see I have a very good memory , or at least I have always thought I had , and 1 could have sworn that on the ship she told me your name was Buzz . " Somehow Foster managed to smile across the table at his mother , hoping that his look contained the right degree of affectionate tolerance for the little foibles of a loved one . " Oh , that , " he said indulgently . " Mother always used to call me Buzz when I was a child . Thank heaven she 's gotten over it . " " Because your name is Foster ? " " Well  --  Foster is really my middle name . " He did n't know why he should be stumbling so ; the name had never bothered him before . " My first name is Farnsworth . " This time there was understanding in Monique 's little nod . " I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view . " Although things could not be said to have gone too well up to this point , they now took a decided turn for the worse , because Monique smiled at him and thereby left him completely devoid Tti of intelligence . " Do you know what my , pupils at Bryn Mawr used to call me ? " Of course . Gorgeous . " " Do n't be juvenile . Monkey . They always called me Monkey . " He should , of course , have known better , but a reflex is a reflex . He shuddered . " The little horrors . They probably could n't say Monique . " Her back , he could see , was straight as a plumb line . " They most certainly could . They were extremely intelligent girls , and very charming ones . And you are a dreadful snob . " Well , that did it . Things could n't go on like this . Something must be done . Desperate measures . Caution thrown to the winds . The bull taken by the horns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put his hand on the hand in which she was holding a knife that trembled slightly . " Look , " he said , " let 's not fight . Let 's not ever fight . It 's only because I 'm so dazzled by you that I 'm being so foolish . I 'm not that way really . I give you my word I 'm not , and I hope you 'll give me a chance to prove it . Will you let me take you home tonight ? And to dinner tomorrow , and the day after , and the day after that ? " Although it could n't quite be said that the slight flush of pink was gone from her cheeks , there was very definitely a hint of a smile on the little-girl mouth . " Well , about tomorrow and tomorrow we shall sec . But it would be most kind of you to drive me home tonight . " He sat , or rather , slumped , back in his chair and for the first time in several minutes became aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were six other people at his table . " Mother tells me you 've written a book on Paul Valery , " he said brightly . And for the rest of the evening he was a perfect host . Unaccountably , when Foster rang for his breakfast the following morning , Andre arrived empty-handed , with a distinctly disapproving look on his face . Andre disliked changes in the routine more than Foster himself . " Madame is having breakfast on the terrace , " he said , " and asked if monsieur would join her there . " In spite of himself Foster could n't help grinning . Good old Alice . She had n't missed a trick at dinner and now she wanted to know all the details on what she had missed later . Well , she should have them . attired in his best dressing gown , he sat down opposite his mother at the breakfast table . She regarded him suspiciously , but not until Andre had left did she open A few minutes later , freshly shaved and the attack . " And just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four o'clock in the morning ? " " How did you know it was four o'clock in the morning ? " " I could scarcely have avoided know- 4 ing . The din was indescribable . " " I knocked the Tang bronze out of the niche in the bathroom wall . " " And how on earth did you manage that ? " " Very sat simply . back in I was her chair dancing . " regarded Alice her son as though she harbored grave suspicions as to his sanity . " Dancing , " she said thoughtfully . " In the bathroom . At four in the morning . " " Yes . And as a matter of fact that answers your earlier question about what I . was doing until four o'clock . I was dancing . With Monique . At the Rose Noir . " " You 've told me a dozen times that the Rose Noir was nothing but a tourist trap . " Foster nodded cheerfully . " It is , But Monique wanted to go there . She said I they had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful dancer . " Alice 's patience was wearing thin . " Of T course I know she 's a beautiful dancer . Everyone on the ship knew she was a beautiful dancer . What I did n't know was that you were a beautiful dancer . " If she had thought to puncture her son 's serenity she failed . He shook his head as cheerfully as he had nodded a moment before . " I 'm not . At least not with the cha-cha-cha . That 's why I was practicing in the bathroom . " " Perhaps Monique would give you lessons if you asked her . " " That 's precisely what I intend to do tonight . " Alice opened her mouth , then closed it again and after a moment 's hesitation said , " You 're seeing her again tonight ? " " Yes . I 'm taking her out to dinner . " He toyed with his fork and then said , quite casually , as though it were a matter of little importance , " You know , I thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had deliberately underplayed the line and was as pleased with the reaction as any actor who knows that he has left his audience completely stunned . For the first time in his memory his mother was speechless , and he pressed his advantage . " It seems , " he went on , " that Monique has always wanted to see Texas , and she said that you had invited her to visit you at home . So what could be simpler than for me to come home and she could join us there and we 'll be married in Texas , I can easily get a leave of absence . It all world out perfectly . " Alice swallowed half a glass of the ice water which Andre had grudgingly provided , placed her elbows firmly on the table and surveyed her son as if she were seeing him for the first , me . " I see , " she said . " And have you informed Monique of this perfectly worked-out plan ? " " No , not yet ; but I shall . Possibly tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head solemnly . " But not in the Rose Noir . I doubt if she could hear " And if she finds some fault in the plan ? " Foster regarded his mother slyly . " I do n't think she will . You see she already adores her future mother-in-law , so I 'm off to a flying start . " ( Continued on Page 100 ) ( Continued from Page WO " Well , " Alice said deliberately . " since you seem to have the whole matter so well organized , I suppose there is nothing left for me to do but offer you my congratulations and my blessings . " It was just at this moment that Francoise entered , bearing a square-shaped , silvery object with a heavy black handle , which she had set , rather incongruously , on a large silver tray . Foster stared at her in astonishment . " What on earth , " he demanded , " is that ? " " This , " Francoise announced triumphantly , " is an electric frying pan which madame brought to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proudly at Alice , and Alice nodded approval . " It contains ham and eggs for me . Francoise has told me that you never take anything but fruit and eraissanis for breakfast , but in Texas I am accustomed to something heartier and 1 sec no reason why I should not have it in Paris . " For some time after Francoise had left , Foster simply stared at his mother with unconcealed admiration , but Alice was too busy with her breakfast to notice . " I should have known , " he said , at last . " What should you have known , Buzz ? " " That you would have the last word in one way or another . You always do , do n't you ? " " Not always : but often enough to keep me happy . You see , I have never been a demanding person . " Foster walked over to his mother 's side and , putting one arm around her shoulder , leaned down to kiss her , not on the forehead this time , but full on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said wonderingly , " that I did n't get to know you sooner ? " Alice looked quickly down at her plate . " I 'm sure I do n't know , " she answered , " I 've always been here . Perhaps you just were n't looking . " Her son took her face in the palm of his hand and lilted it so that she had to look at him , grinned when he saw her eyes and kissed her again . " Well , I 'm glad that I 've found you now , " he said . " That , " Alice said firmly , " will be enough of that . If you will excuse me I must go and get ready for luncheon , We 're driving to the country , so I doubt that I shall be back before you leave . Give my love to Monique . " A few minutes later , in the security of her own rooms , she sat down at her desk , lit a cigarette , smiled happily at the ceiling and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Pennyworth . " Charles , " she said gleefully , " it 's almost too good to be true . The boy is in an absolute tizzy . They were out dancing all night and this morning he announced categorically that he was going to marry her  --  and in Texas , if you please . What 's more , he 's taking her out to dinner tonight . You do n't know what that means , but I do . He never goes out on Sunday ; but then , I doubt that he knows it 's Sunday . . . . What ? Oh , darling , you were magnificent , and thank heaven you were here . Those two boys he dug up were too dreadful . I should never have let Monique have anything to do with either of them , even if she had been interested , which is highly unlikely . . . Do n't be silly ; of course she 'll say yes .
