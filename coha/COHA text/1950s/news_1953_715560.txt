txt BONN , Germany , July 2 ? The Bundestag blocked today ratification of the London Debt Agreement and tied the hands of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in any negotiations with France on the future status of the Saar . In a snap vote engineered by the Social Democrats , the Bundestag rejected the French Government 's $11,800,000 claim in the London agreement for post-war economic aid given to Germany and in so doing the lower house of the Bonn Parliament blocked ratification ? of the entire London agreement , which was concluded Feb. 27 . Other sections of the London agreement , which provided for payment of 13,730,000,000 Deutsche marks ( about $3,270,000,000 ) to sixteen countries in settlement of pre-war and post-war debts , were passed through two readings without much difficulty . Three readings are , required by law . The Bundestag rejected the French claim by 148 votes against 135 . Government leaders hope to re-introduce the bill of ratification tomorrow but it is almost certain that the Bundestag , which goes on vacation tomorrow evening , will not be able to resume discussion until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The defeat of the French claim was another tactical maneuver by the Social Democrats to play a // role in the forthcoming genera election campaign as the defenders of Germany 's reunification and independence of all foreign servitudes and ties . French Exploitation Charged Prof. Wilhelm Guelich , Social Democrat , said during the debate that although France had helped Germany she had taken much more from her zone of occupation ' than she had put into it . He asserted that such aid could not be regarded as aid and that the balance lay with the French exploitation of Germany . The reappearance of German nationalism as a major factor in the general election campaign was more apparent in a resolution voted unanimously , with the Communists abstaining , tying the hands of Dr. Adenauer in future negotiations with France on the status of the Saar . The resolution , submitted by the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Bundestag , instructed the West German Government to be guided by the following principles in future negotiations : First , that the Saar , according to German and international law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boundaries . Second , that the present order in the Saar is part of the . internal organization of Germany established by the occupying powers in pursuance of the supreme power they assumed temporarily . Third , that in negotiating and concluding treaties concerning the Saar , the West German Government must see to it ( a ) that free and democratic conditions are created in the Saar and ( b ) that the de facto separation of the Saar from Germany inust be ended and the Saar recognized as an integral part of Germany . The Social Democrats took the lead in a debate on the resolution and emphasized the irredentist character of the German claim to the territory . French Critized on Saar Karl Mommer , Social Democrat , said ' that French control of the Saar was based on tanks as was the Russian control of East Germany . He asserted that the French regime in the Saar and the Soviet regimes in East Germany were founded on the power of foreign troops . Herr Mommer accused France of being the first foreign power to detach a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established a " quisling " regime in the Saar . The Social Democratic deputy said his remarks were not intended to be anti-French . He said the separation of the Saar from Germany was not a good basis for European unity and that insistence on the return of the Saar represented a pro-European move . Willie Eichler , another Social Democrat , demanded that Dr. Adenauer take the same line on th Saar as the French were taking on the European Defense Community Treaty and say : " We are not inclined to discuss other problems as long as the Saar issue has not been settled . " Herr Eichler argued that the present situation in the Saar undermined and invalidated the West 's protests to the Soviet Government on the June 17 uprising in East Germany ' because " what is happening in the East and in the Saar is basically the same . " " We shall insist that justice be restored behind and on this side of the Iron Curtain , " he added . ?             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
