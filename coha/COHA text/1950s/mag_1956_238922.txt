Almost daily since the U.S. Supreme Court banned segregation in the public schools , an odd ritual has taken place in little ( pop . 5,100 ) Hillsboro , Ohio . Each morning before the Webster elementary school opened , a group of Negro mothers would march up to its main door , parade around for a while with placards reading , " Our Children Play Together ; Why Ca n't They Learn Together ? " and then return peacefully to their homes . There was never any violence , not even a sign of hate or temper . But the fact remained that Hillsboro is the scene of the only integration battle in Ohio . <P> Until 1939 Hillsboro never really thought of maintaining separate Negro and white schools . But that year , when Webster was jammed to capacity , the board of education decided to solve the problem by quietly packing all Negro pupils off to the ramshackle Lincoln elementary school on the east side of town . For 15 years no one protested . Then came the Supreme Court 's historic decision . Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit their children . The board 's answer : it redistricted the whole town , assigned two widely separated Negro neighborhoods to all-Negro Lincoln . <P> Do n't Budge . In the summer of 1954 the white county engineer , Philip Partridge , a hot antisegregationist , became so incensed over the board 's action that he tried to burn Lincoln down ( he was convicted of arson and sentenced to 1 to 15 years , paroled after serving nine months ) . Later , five Negro mothers took their case to court . All this failed to budge the board an inch . When school opened that fall , 22 Negro children who tried to get into Webster were turned away . Their mothers , refusing to send them to Lincoln , began tutoring them at home . <P> <P> Though the board insisted it was without racial prejudice , it argued that until the town could complete a new school , the 850-pupil Webster School could not possibly add 22 Negroes . Judge John H. Druffel of the United States District Court apparently agreed , for he refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last fall , when school opened again , Negro pupils applying for Webster were given chairs on the first day , but assigned no classes . On the second day the chairs disappeared . <P> Keep Stalling . In January the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Druffel . The judge , however , still refused to issue the required injunction " unless the Supreme Court tells me to . " Last week the Supreme Court did . But the Hillsboro board was not through yet . <P> At first it stalled until it formally received Judge Druffel 's order . Then it hit upon the idea of ordering placement tests for the Negroes who had been tutored at home . To convince everyone of its objectivity , it invited the State Department of Education to supervise the testing , only to find that the department had no such tests on hand and would have to get them from Chicago . At week 's end the tests duly arrived : the last bastion of segregation in Ohio had finally fallen .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
