Not since the R.A.F. bombed the gates in 1944 to free a batch of Resistance fighters had anyone escaped from France 's grim , grey Amiens prison . It was just the quiet , safe place to send hulkingly handsome Lon Meurant , to await the summons to the guillotine . <P> Leon was a droll and imaginative fellow , the bored guards agreed . The French police had first become acquainted with Lon 's imagination six years before , after they had found the nude body of a White Russian countess lying in the Paris-Brussels road . The countess , who had been strangled with a nylon stocking , was known to have left Brussels with a young French medical officer named Count Vernier de Miraumont . The police finally found the man practicing gynecology in occupied Germany . They soon learned that he was neither a count , a doctor , an officer nor a Frenchman . He was a Belgian metal worker named Lon Meurant , and he had a long police record . <P> A Missing Mongol . Arrested , Meurant promptly confessed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his story . The killer , he swore , was a Mongol , a Soviet agent in U.S. uniform , otherwise known as Operative B 13 . He himself , Meurant obligingly told the police , was in reality Soviet Operative B 17 . The Mongol , he went on , had hidden in the trunk compartment of his car , stripped the countess to find some secret papers she was carrying , and strangled her , all before Meurant could interfere . " Brassires and panties , " Meurant told an Amiens court informatively , " are excellent for hiding microfilm . " After searching high &; low for the Mongol , French justice finally condemned Lon Meurant to death . <P> At Amiens prison Murderer Meurant flabbergasted the prison censors by writing cozily intimate letters to an ex-Premier and an archbishop , addressing the statesman by his first name . He so charmed the prison guards that they regularly let him put on his own leg irons and handcuffs ( required for men condemned to death ) each evening When Meurant offered to show Part-Time Guard Jacques Gauvin " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the guard was so flattered that he promptly passed his revolver through the bars to the prisoner . The second time he did it , Meurant refused to give it back . " Oh , " he soothed , " here we 're just one happy family ; keep quiet , now , and I 'll see that you 're promoted . " <P> A Vulgar Criminal . Soon afterward , his leg irons resting comfortably against the grill of his cell , Meurant was enjoying a game of belote with two guards . Suddenly he whipped out the revolver . " One move , " he said pleasantly , " and I 'll burn you . " While Meurant brandished his weapon , his cellmate , Murderer Michel Courtin , got the keys and unlocked the door . Meurant rounded up two more guards , locked them in the cell with the others , rummaged through the clothes locker for his good suit , and then calmly sat down to finish a letter . " I am escaping only to prove my innocence , " he wrote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulgar criminal . I am giving him 10,000 francs , but he wo n't get far on that . " Donning the caps and capes of the prison guards , the two then departed , and , when running into someone , put on a brave show as guards seeking the missing prisoners .
