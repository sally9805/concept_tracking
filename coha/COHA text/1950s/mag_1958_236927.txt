PEOPLE OF THE REEDS ( 223 pp. ) - Gavin Maxwell-Harper ( $4.50 ) . <P> ARABESQUE AND HONEYCOMB ( 224 pp. ) - Sacheverell Sifwe/l-Random House ( $6 ) . <P> <P> " The best book , " says the Talmud , " is the world . " The good travel book mirrors two worlds , the one the traveler visits , and the one he brings with him . These double worlds are fascinatingly mirrored in two new travel books about the exotic lands of Iran and Iraq . <P> Nomads of the Waters . For Gavin Maxwell , a former British army major , travel in southern Iraq meant travail . He was all but eaten by fleas , broke his nose firing off a skin diver 's spear gun , and was charged by a wild boar to within three feet of his life . His consolation may have been that the primitive Arab tribesmen he visited were in just as bad a fix . <P> The Ma'dan live on bits of marshland and floating islands near the juncture of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers . Wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the adult Ma'dan males ; another enemy is the arbid water snake , whose bite kills in 20 minutes . Despite these hazards , the Arabs placidly use the reeds to plait straw mats ( for export ) and to build the Quonset-like huts in which they live . In their way , the Ma'dan enjoy life , particularly food . Their table manners are covered by the proverb , " Eat like a camel and be the first to finish . " For Author Maxwell , this was not as simple as it sounded . To the Arabs , the left hand is ritually unclean and must not be used for eating ; Neophyte Maxwell made " many a slip ' twixt the right fist and the lip , and sometimes " feasted " on a grain or two of rice . But he managed to pick up just about all the grains of local color , ranging from the fact that a blood feud can be settled at a cost of seven women ( the equivalent of 21 buffaloes or about 500 ) to the intelligence that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death ( " Her brothers will cut her throat " ) . <P> To Author Maxwell , the harsh Ma'dan way of life justified itself in manly grace and dignity of spirit . He once saw a tribesman flash his five-pronged spear 45 ft. from a moving canoe and impale a 9-by-3-in. fish . Such feats may soon be legend , for the government plans to drain the marshlands , and in a few years the proud Ma'di " will be driving a lorry if he is lucky , or pimping in the back streets of Basra . " With a fine writing hand , Author Maxwell gives a fond last salute to these progress-doomed nomads of the waters . <P> Sinbad on the Prowl . On the map . Sacheverell Sit well 's book , with its Iranian setting , is a borderline twin to Gavin Maxwell 's . But in a subtler geography , it is continents apart . Where Author Maxwell soaks up the perishable life of a rugged people . Veteran Travel Writer Sitwell ( Portugal and Madeira , Spain ) sifts impressions of imperishable works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel is ideally the soul 's refreshment among masterpieces . His book is a litany of the beauties of Islam , mainly its mosques and shrines.
